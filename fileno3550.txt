“……”F * ck!At this moment, it wasn't that he had a headache, but ... He was really a little afraid.Crazy!The world of neo martial was a group of lunatics. Moreover, the human King's bewitching power was too strong. Some of the neo martial artists had even been ... Brainwashed by his multi-level marketing. To be honest, with such courage, in this occasion, where tens of thousands of emperors and Chaos Overlords were gathered, this group of neo martial lunatics actually cheered for the human King crazily!It was as if they really felt that the human King ... Was invincible in the world!This group of lunatics, with enough strength, would definitely ... Definitely be extremely terrifying.Long Zhan and the few of them were actually a little fearful and also a little envious at this moment.Even though it felt ... Childish.But to be honest, would their people dare to speak in such a situation?He probably didn't dare to.,m Long Zhan looked at some of the chaos beasts from the corner of his eyes and sighed in his heart. My chaos race actually has a lot of experts, but our spirit has not been unleashed to the extreme. To fight for the race, in the eyes of some chaos race, it is just ... An empty slogan.At this moment, he really wanted to have a detailed chat with the human King.It was true.Long Zhan felt that he could even chat with the human King for a few more days. He wanted to experience for himself how neo martial led everyone in a difficult situation and completed its rise at an extraordinary speed.How did he do it?All of this was worth learning. He felt that he had underestimated the human King.In the past, she had only thought that he was crazy, lucky, and strong. But today, she understood that the human King did not only have these. He had faith, hot-bloodedness, impulsiveness, decisiveness in his actions, a tenacious spirit, and the courage to not fear difficulties ...How could such a person not succeed?……  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  In the dark, Li Hao was also listening carefully.This was the purpose of the dojo. It was not only about Dao, but also the beliefs, qualities, and persistence of the strong ...A human King was only a thousand years old.In the chaos, he was very, very young. Li Hao had once thought that the human King was very childish and immature. Today, however, he had changed his mind. It was not that the human King was immature, but ... The human King had always maintained the passion of his youth and had never faded!It was easy to be hot-blooded for a while, but it was really difficult to be hot-blooded for a lifetime.At this moment, the human King saw that he had won the battle of words and laughed heartily,""Alright, everyone, there's no need to feel inferior. Let's play Go together. No matter who gets first, I'll get first! Why don't we play some stakes?"Huntian Supreme Emperor originally did not want to bother, but long Zhan continued,""What's the wager?"The human King laughed. It was good that someone was talking to him. He laughed and said,""Let's have some fun together. Whoever gets first place will get the rest ... 10 billion great Dao crystals. It's just a small prize, just for fun!"“……”Everyone was speechless. Are you sure?You're the weakest and you want to bet on this?What did that mean?You're so sure you're first?Or ... At this moment, Spring Autumn Emperor laughed and said,""Did daoqi give you any convenience?" "Otherwise, why are you so confident? Ten billion is not worth mentioning to us, but to you ... Your neo martial arts has just risen, right?""What do you know?" the human King laughed. If he lost, it would only be 10 billion! He won ... One, two, three, 30 billion! As the saying goes, 100% profit is enough to make people die. 300% profit can make me your fighter!"Then, he smiled and said, Li Hao, are you interested in joining one? Otherwise, it would be difficult to judge your level. If you let someone walk 8000 squares to discuss the Dao with you and you can't even walk it yourself, what kind of discussion is that? What qualifications do you have to discuss Dao? I'll let you play ... If you win, you'll get 40 billion great Dao crystals! Since Spring Autumn was so rich, why not add another 10 billion? Huntian level 9, why not add another 10 billion? Long Zhan ... Forget it, you're also a poor ghost, so poor that you can hear the tinkling sounds. My Eastern three-man Group is all relatively poor ... Not as rich as you all. It's a pity that the cowards from the five-element world didn't come, otherwise ..."As soon as he said that, Li Hao flew over in the darkness and laughed."Actually, I haven't played chess in a long time, so I really haven't tried it. If senior human King is interested ... I don't really mind, but the ten billion bet ..."At this point, Li Hao smiled."I don't have any for the time being. I'm rather poor. How about this? if I lose and I don't get first place, whoever gets first place can personally feel time ... The feeling I'm talking about can even ... Touch and detect time."The human King was speechless."Good Lord. You're going all out for tens of billions of great Dao crystals. Aren't you afraid that these guys will shatter your Dao?""I'm not afraid. "Li Hao laughed."We are all seniors. I, Li Hao, am only a young man less than 30 years old. Who would lose face in front of a junior?"“……”The human King cursed in his heart!艹!This is my exclusive. In the past, I could say this in front of many people, including now. Even if you don't come, I can also say,"good fellow, you stole my words away!"How hateful!I helped you when there were benefits, but now you're suppressing me as well!This is too much!The other venerable sovereigns were all speechless.Was ten billion great Dao crystals a lot?To an Overlord, it wasn't much. To long Zhan ... It was still alright, it was a little too much. However, he controlled the four-direction region and countless worlds contributed great Dao crystals. In fact, he was not that poor now.These two weaklings even dared to come out and gamble. It was just a small prize!At that moment, huntian Daoist laughed,"I have no objections. Then I'll offer 20 billion as a wager!" What about you, Spring Autumn?"Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn also laughed and said,"what opinion can I have?" The human King put you and me together, which means that you and I are on the same level. I'm very happy, 10 billion more is nothing!"At this moment, long Zhan also laughed in spite of himself."Then I won't compete with the two of you. 10 billion then. The human King and silver Moon King are both human elites. I'm afraid that if there's really no more, that would be a loss."The five cultivators were now like friends. They gambled and laughed.The Monarchs below were all envious and confused.These people ... Weren't they enemies?Also, at this moment, he was filled with anticipation. How far could these people go?A large number of eighth level venerable sovereigns had not been able to reach the 8000th square. Could these people make it?Even if they could, who could take the first place?At this moment, he was filled with anticipation.Li Hao also looked at the human King. The human King chuckled and winked at Li Hao. At this moment, he no longer looked like a senior, nor did he have the solemness of a martial arts master.Li Hao was helpless. This person ... He really didn't know what to say.At this moment, a competitive spirit was aroused. Human King, bewitching people, that was really something!

Chapter 3551 Spirit (1)
Ten thousand emperors gathered and five Emperors fought.At this moment, Li Hao couldn't hide his impulse. This group of people and these few people were the true overlords of the entire chaos.Here, they were playing chess.Who could be the best?The Dao crystal was good, but it wasn't the most important thing for Li Hao at the moment. What was important was the assessment of his own comprehension of the great Dao and the judgment of the other venerable sovereigns.Huntian's group had reached where they were today because they thought that they were only strong in terms of pure strength. If they thought that they were strong together, then they were underestimating them.He must have comprehended many Dao laws.In fact ... It might even reach nine thousand. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Comprehension was comprehension, and condensation was condensation. No matter what, these people were extremely powerful to be able to condense a Dao domain with more than 7000 Dao laws.In the void, the figure of the chess piece appeared.At this moment, he was a little excited.It had been too many years since such a scene had been seen. Of course, it had happened in the past. Some grade-9 cultivators had been there before. When Tian Fang was still around, he had invited some grade-9 cultivators to go there.Among the grade-9 cultivators, most of them could reach above nine thousand. However, there were also a few who could not do it.Of course, to be able to reach the ninth step, they must have their own special qualities.Now, he also knew that the sixth-tier young man who had come to play Dao chess back then ... Had probably fought. That was truly a shocking talent that would shock an era ... Unfortunately, it was not his era.Zhan's era ... Was actually his own era. Other than neo martial and silver Moon, almost no one knew about him at that time.Battle was the end of the path of chess. He saw tianfang and sat down to discuss the path with the master of tianfang. He didn't know how they discussed the path, but he knew that battle was the second cultivator to directly pass the level.The first was Tian Fang himself.Of course, the battle that day did not reach the last square. In fact, it was almost the end. The master of tianfang appeared and did not allow the battle to continue. However, Dao Qi knew that if the battle had continued that day, they would have been able to make it through.Why didn't you let Zhan continue?Perhaps the master of tianfang felt that if he continued, he would definitely pass and there was no need to continue.Perhaps he felt that he had really reached the end and peeked into the secret of space?Who knows?In any case, in the eyes of Dao chess, only by fighting could one clear the stage after Tian Fang.Some time ago, Li Hao could have walked more than 7000 Doug AG.He had improved quite a bit over the past few days, and he had gained quite a bit of insight. In Dao chess, he felt that he would have no problem getting eight thousand. As for more ... It was not easy to judge at the moment.The others could probably do it too.These people were probably the most powerful group of people in the chaos.Dao Qi didn't say anything. With a wave of his hand, a five-sided chessboard appeared between heaven and earth. He looked at the overlords and said,""In the past, there were many grade-9 cultivators in the tianfang realm. There were many grade-9 cultivators ...""For a million years, the game of chess has been silent, and no venerable sovereign has ever been there. After the 8000 squares, no one has set foot in the 8000 realms ... Venerable sovereigns, today ... I wonder if you can reproduce the glory of the venerable sovereigns a million years ago!"He was also a little sad.It had been a million years! No one else walked out of the 8000 squares, let alone the 9000 squares.It was too far.It was as if a lifetime had passed."There will be one today!" The human King smiled."Then should we split up?" he looked at the crowd.They didn't say much. The human King took the lead and went straight for the chess piece in the middle. If he had to be the first, he would be the first to set out, the first to pass the levels, the first to pass eight thousand ...Huntian Daoist just smiled and walked in the air, heading straight for the Dao chess pieces on the left.Venerable Emperor Spring Autumn laughed and went to the right.Li Hao and long Zhan didn't have much choice. They could only go to the human King's side, so they didn't care too much about this.The five venerable sovereigns entered the chessboard together. It was like a cover that covered the few of them. Only a few shadows could be vaguely seen. Dao Qi's voice resounded,"Venerable sovereigns, there are more than a thousand of them. The chess is shaking. Do you need to hide the movement?""There's no need for that!""No!" The human King rejected immediately."Let's see who will be the first to pass 8000!"His competitive spirit was as strong as ever.Li Hao and the others, on the other hand, didn't say anything.Up to you.……Below.At this moment, countless venerable sovereigns were overwhelmed with emotions. Not only that, but a large number of venerable sovereigns were also pouring in from all directions, as if the news had already been sent out.The venerable sovereigns, who had not planned to enter, rushed over.Five chessboards stood in the sky above the Daoist Rite temple."All the overlords are here ..." Someone asked in a low voice."Then ... What about the world of five elements?"Today, although he had not come in person, it had to be said that this was a rare Grand gathering of chaos. In the end, no one from the five elements realm had come.An expert from the North laughed."Sovereign Gold spirit is in seclusion, cultivating the five elements Dao and trying to combine the five elements into one. He's different from these people ..."Some of them had reached the end of the road, while others were landlords.However, sovereign Golden Spirit was currently in a rising stage.In the eyes of Li Hao and the others, the North was the weakest. However, in the eyes of others, the five elements in the North had great potential, because the metal spirit Emperor had only combined metal and earth. If he could really combine the five elements, he would be able to compete with the first of spring and autumn, even if he did not surpass the chaos heavens."Who do you think will go the furthest?""It's definitely huntian supremacy!"Many people were communicating with each other, regardless of whether they knew each other.

Chapter 3552 Spirit (2)
Huntian, a rank nine venerable sovereign!He was also the only level nine venerable sovereign.Other than him, who could surpass him?Although the human King was domineering and Li Hao was mysterious, and strength was not the only thing that mattered here, how much could one comprehend without strength?"Not necessarily. I think it's Supreme Lord Spring Autumn! "Spring and autumn are the beginning of time, and time Withers and prospers .... It's also said to be a Dao of time, and is incomparably powerful ...."“……”There were people who guessed both of them. As for the other three, the eastern trio had fewer guesses. There were also many people discussing who would have the least.At this moment, someone sent a voice transmission, I think ... It might be the human King! Although he was clamoring, it was not bad that the human King was good at fighting. However, was the great Dao Comprehension very strong on the side of neo martial? They are all a bunch of boorish men ... Do you think that the human King can go far? Although the Silver Moon King is a little young, he was able to build the heavenly Daoist field, and the Dao chess has always been by his side ... I think he's already been there many times and is familiar with it. Even if he's not as good as others, he'll definitely go further than the human King!""That's true!"“……”Everyone thought about it and felt that it made sense.The human King was the last!……At this moment, on neo martial's side.The group of venerable sovereigns were also curious. Hearing the voices around them, many of them looked at the Supreme sovereigns. A few young cultivators even asked directly,""Supreme martial artist, the human King ... Can't really be the last, right?"That would be too tragic!He had said a lot of harsh words just now. Even if he was last, everyone could still accept it. After all, the others were very strong, and Li Hao was the owner of this place. It was normal for the human King to be last.But ...He was still unhappy!The Supreme venerable shook his head. It was hard for him to judge, but he knew that the ordinary venerable sovereigns had still underestimated Fang ping.They all felt that he was not good at comprehending the Dao.How could that be possible?If he really wasn't good at the great Dao, how could he combine the yin and yang world?If he wasn't skilled in the great Dao, how could he open up his inner world?If one wasn't proficient in the great Dao, how could they obtain the recognition of battle? the rise of the human King had a huge connection to battle. The energy of battle was almost all given to the human King. In fact, if it wasn't for the fact that the human King didn't want the time constellation, perhaps the one controlling time today would also be the human King.However ... Whether or not he could take the first place, he was not sure."Supreme martial artist ... Why don't you go up and fight for it?" someone looked at the Supreme martial artist.They felt that if a Supreme martial artist were to go, he might have a greater chance than a human King. A Supreme martial artist walked the path of the book of Daoism, the path of the people, and the myriad DAOs would be complete. Of course, the complete myriad DAOs didn't mean that he had truly comprehended the myriad DAOs.However, he should have gone further than the human King, right?"What am I fighting for? He's the king of neo martial!"The Supreme martial artist was extremely calm."If he wins, then neo martial arts will win. That's the source of my neo martial arts 'confidence. Even if I take first place ... If I ask you to self-destruct, will you be willing?""Don't mention the self-destruction!"Someone mumbled. Why did he keep bringing this up? Grandmaster laughed and said no more.Yeah.Therefore, everyone still hoped that Fang ping would win, not themselves. They had greater expectations for Fang ping. It was fine if he lost, but once he won, it would definitely make everyone ecstatic.And if he went up, even if he won, these guys might not feel anything.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ ……Not just them, at this moment, long Zhan's people were also discussing animatedly.On the other side, Silver moon's men were much quieter. However, as they looked at Li Hao's chessboard, they were also filled with anticipation. Although they usually liked to talk tough, today ... They were indeed lacking in confidence.Li Hao's true strength was only around 3000 to 4000 Dao laws after the 2000 realms were completed.p Such strength was the weakest among the five.Moreover, it was not just a little weaker.Even if they had sent a clone, the difference between a clone and a true body was only one point. It could only be used if they forced their way through the levels. The comprehension of the great Dao was actually the same.To rely on comprehension to walk, everyone was actually the same.It all depended on the later stages. If one's comprehension was insufficient, one wouldn't be able to continue on. If one's true body left, then one's strength would be even stronger, and one would naturally be able to go further ... But there wasn't much meaning to it.At this moment, even Qian Wuliang, who had always been confident in Li Hao, quieted down.There was no flattery.In this situation, if they raised their tone too high, Li Hao would end up last, which would be even more embarrassing. After all, Silver Moon martial masters cared more about their reputation.……But Li Hao didn't care about that.He took a step into the chessboard. He had walked on it a few times, but he was not familiar with it. He was very familiar with the layout of the various DAOs.In the past, when he left, he had some feelings.But today, Li Hao stood on the first square for a long time. Li Hao's knowledge, strength, experience, and vision were all much better than before.He had condensed a calamity Dao and split up the time Dao. These were all grade nine DAOs.He had gathered the heavenly Daoist field and comprehended many great DAOs.Looking at it again ... The tens of thousands of chess pieces were like small light spots that kept changing. Finally, a Dao domain appeared in his eyes. It was a space Dao domain.Li Hao wasn't in a hurry. He just watched in silence.On the other side, there was a loud boom. That was the vibration of the chessboard. This meant that ... Someone had already broken through the 1000 great Dao. It was unbelievably fast. On his left was the human King, and on his right was the spring and autumn.The movement came from the left.Clearly, the number of human Kings had exceeded 1000.It was unbelievably fast!It only took an instant.Soon, there was also movement on the right side. The great Dao fluctuated for a moment. It was spring and autumn. Clearly, this person was also extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he had broken through 1000 Dao. These top existences 'comprehension of Dao was ridiculously strong.

Chapter 3553 Spirit (3)
It was difficult for ordinary cultivators, even third level venerable sovereigns, to reach 1000.But to them, it was just a blink of an eye.At this moment, Li Hao also took a step forward. It was as if he had entered a different space. He didn't stay for long. To them, striking after the enemy and shocking the world with a single brilliant feat ... Didn't mean much.Li Hao was very familiar with these DAOs.It was as if he was walking on flat ground.In the blink of an eye, he shuttled through the chess pieces. The power of all the great DAOs was gathered by him. In the blink of an eye, Li Hao merged them into a ball of light. Thousands of DAOs gathered. With a boom, the thousand chess pieces had been cleared!Around him, two similar sounds could be heard.……Below.The venerable sovereigns were all shocked.This was too fast!The five venerable sovereigns had crossed over a thousand squares in an instant. At this moment, some of the venerable sovereigns were extremely resentful. "There's no way to compare! I'm still at 999 units, and I'm struggling with 1000 units ... I don't know how many days it'll take ..."However, in an instant, all five of them had broken the 1000 mark.This was way too fast!Was there such a huge difference?"The human King seems to be the fastest ...""It's normal for the front to be faster. Besides, the time is almost the same ..."Everyone watched intently. In fact, they could not see anything at the moment. They could only see a few shadows walking on the chessboard in the void as if they were walking on flat ground. It was not as difficult as they usually were.……For Li Hao and the others, the first 5000 to 6000 squares weren't a challenge at all.At this moment, Li Hao continued walking, blocking out the sounds on both sides. He no longer cared about them. At this moment, he was only walking his own path, perfecting his own path, and integrating it.Recently, he had comprehended a lot, but he hadn't absorbed many of them. Here, in Dao chess, there were some similar DAOs that could make him more complete.The three-thousandth world had not been completely opened.In the 3000th world, Li Hao wanted to focus on desire. Therefore, whenever he encountered the Dao of desire or the Dao of emotion, he would stay for a while to comprehend and experience the differences.The DAOs in Dao chess might not be exactly the same as Tian Fang, but they were all left behind by Tian Fang, so their roots were still the same.As Li Hao walked, he also created his own little realm.One by one, the little realms began to circle around him. He had an advantage over the others. He had entered with his true body instead of his spiritual body. In this aspect, even human Kings were inferior to him.If they forced their way in, they might not be able to win against Li Hao without their real bodies.However, it did not mean much."Desire. The seven emotions and six desires are only a part of it ..."As Li Hao thought about it, he thought of Qian Wuliang's Dao of emotion. In fact, they had a lot in common and could be considered complementary.All desires were related to emotions.Be it greed or jealousy, they were all just external manifestations.For example, Li Hao's extreme desire to revive his brothers and parents was also a kind of emotional outburst. Was this greed or something else?With this desire, he had destroyed the cycle of life and death! How could he fuse them together perfectly?Many thoughts emerged in Li Hao's mind. He waved his hand, and little realms appeared beside him. There was anger, despair, disappointment, greed, and lust ...Everything was there.As for the Dao of desire, it was given some Dao and had spirituality ...In Li Hao's opinion, the spirituality of Dao was actually closely related to one's emotions.The great Dao is heartless ...The Dao of ruthlessness, relatively speaking, was the Dao of chaos and disorder!A truly orderly Dao should have emotions.Some were calm, some were fluctuating. These were all emotions, all of them were desires.Understanding one Dao, understanding ten thousand Dao.Li Hao continued to walk while thinking. He soon passed the 2000 squares!……At the same time.Huntian Daoist was also walking as if he was walking on flat ground. He walked for a while, stopped for a while, and looked at it. He didn't try to gain any insight, but just looked at it silently.This was space!Of course, he knew that this might not be the complete way of space. Tian Fang might not be able to carve the complete way of space on the Dao chess. However, it would still be of great reference to him."What's the difference between the real space and the space here?" The rules?Huntian thought that the DAOs here were all dead and man-made, not the true chaos great Dao."Space ... Chaos is all there is to it. Space is everywhere, and wherever it is, it is space ..."As this thought surfaced in his mind, he did not stay any longer. He continued to move forward. Perhaps, he would only be able to see more when he reached the end.Numerous Dao laws had appeared around him, and they were so dense that they seemed to merge into everything around him. He continued to move forward at astonishing speed, not willing to stay behind any longer.……"Three thousand!""Huntian Knight is still faster ... He's already reached 3000 Doug!""Yup!"The people outside couldn't see and could only hear the sound of a thousand each time. Huntian's side had already heard three times.The human King followed closely behind.Following that, spring and autumn came.After that, it was long Zhan. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Li Hao, this time, was even slower. After a while, the sound of 3000 Doug AG rang out."Dao master Hao Yue ... Seems to have slowed down.""It's normal. After all, their strength is slightly weaker ... Those few are all old venerable sovereigns, except for the human King ..."The human King was also very young, but he was older than Li Hao. This veteran could also be considered a human King.

Chapter 3554 Spirit (3)
"It seems that Dao master Hao Yue will lose this time.""Let's wait and see!"“……”The crowd continued to watch. Even if they couldn't see anything, they were still excited.……"Dao...Spirit ..."At this moment, Li Hao stopped and fell into deep thought.Dao has spirit!The Dao in Dao chess did not have any spirituality at all, so it could only be regarded as a model. The master of tianfang did not leave a key point in the great Dao of Dao chess.Spirituality!Without spirituality, one could only try to form a great Dao. Even if one succeeded, it would be useless.It was impossible for them to gather into a space.When one reached grade-9, even if the great Dao did not have a spirit, the core Dao would definitely have a spirit.At this moment, Li Hao had reached the path of joy, which was also one of the thousands of great paths. He had also condensed this small world. After thinking for a while, he tried to integrate his joy into it.It was just that ... It was not strong enough."I'm still lacking in spirit nurturing ... Teacher once said a long time ago that nurturing the Dao meridians and nurturing the meridians and spirit is like raising a child ..."At this moment, Li Hao thought of force!Force transformed into a God!At this moment, his heart skipped a beat. He had cultivated the five birds technique for a long time and had once condensed the five elements and five Forces. Other things aside, there was one thing that was very intelligent-the fierce tiger!Tiger of heart fire!This was a God formed from Shi, but it was also Li Hao's own emotions that had reached their peak. It was a fire of anger."Force ... Spirit ... Dao ..."​ Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly. He had almost forgotten about this.The fire World!He quickly summoned his fire elemental world. At this moment, within the world, a piece of divine text transformed into a great Dao. Within the divine text, there seemed to be a ferocious Tiger.It breathed on its own, operated on its own, and operated the fire-type technique!In the past, he had only thought that using the fire element was relatively simple. However, today, he suddenly had some ideas. Could the fire element Tiger be considered a type of spirit?Moreover, it's a spirit that I raised myself, the spirit of my emotions!In fact, this was also a kind of angry emotional spirit.That day, when he was watching the Tiger, he felt that it was trapped in a cage. The fire in his heart was boiling, and the Tiger was out of the cage. That was how the Tiger came about."I'm furious! Fire!"Emotions could also correspond to the five elements!Li Hao's mind was suddenly filled with an idea, and he suddenly felt enlightened.Silvermoon's Shi was also a rather special existence.And the Silver Moon was born from the stars of time."Time and Stars all possess a certain amount of spirit .... And so on and so forth. Power, fuse with the Dao, nurture power, nurture the Dao. Does that mean that power is actually a method of nurturing the Dao and nurturing the spirit?"If that's the case ..." Li Hao suddenly realized that, if that was the case, it meant that there was a way to nurture Dao spirits inside the time star.And he had once again been negligent.Before this, he was still thinking of integrating people into the Dao!Wrong!It was the merging force!"Miscalculated ... So that's how it is! So the birth of martial masters is to coordinate with the cultivation of Dao spirits!"Li Hao suddenly became more cheerful and laughed.Back then, his teacher had always said that the cultivation of power was the cultivation of the spirit, and the cultivation of the spirit was the accumulation of spirit ...Back then, he had only listened.His teacher might have just said that. In fact, he might not have been able to express his true thoughts. However, now that he thought about it, his teacher probably wanted to say that if the Dao Meridian was obedient, it would be stronger ... If the Dao Meridian was obedient, it meant that the great Dao was obedient. In fact, it had a spirit!He had actually not thought of this."Holy prose ... Power. Countless Holy prose will appear from that person in the future, and the Holy prose all have some spirituality ... This time, I completely understand!"At this moment, Li Hao finally figured out his last doubt.A spirit nurturing technique!In fact, it was a cultivation method.With this thought in mind, Li Hao beckoned at the Tiger in the fire elemental domain with his finger and laughed.""Are you angry? I've imprisoned you again, so miserable ..."That fierce tiger seemed to understand human nature!It was clearly Li Hao's Shi, but at this moment, it roared at the sky with some anger.Heart fire Tiger, out of the cage Tiger!He had wanted to escape from the cage, but now, he was trapped again.Overseeing the fire elemental world, he appeared to be very frustrated.At this moment, a small realm appeared in Li Hao's hand. It was the realm of wrath that had just been formed. Li Hao smiled brightly."Come in ... This great Dao is extremely angry, violent, and explosive ... If you can completely integrate into it, the Dao of anger can come out of its cage at any time ..."The Tiger seemed to be a little annoyed.Li Hao conversed for a while. The Tiger was extremely angry. It suddenly walked out of the fire elemental domain and roared. It suddenly swallowed the little realm, swallowing the path of anger. What do you mean by 'keep watch'? I'll swallow it!Li Hao's eyes flickered!He looked at the ferocious Tiger ... And then at the fire elemental world, which had forcefully swallowed the world of wrath ...Li Hao's expression suddenly changed! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  "Dao.....Melt!"Dao integration!This was taking the initiative to merge with the Dao.The Dao of change.It was a combination, a special combination.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly understood the combination of time. The special combination could change constantly. Why did it change?That was because Dao had spirituality.Therefore, when these DAOs encountered similar DAOs, they might devour each other. Or DAOs that had common points might devour each other. This was also a combination and fusion in the eyes of ordinary people.

Chapter 3555 Spirit (3)_5
"This is not a mechanical fusion, but ... A fusion of the same origin ... The Tiger represents anger, and anger ... Anger is also a fire element!"It could actually be like this?Li Hao was stunned. He muttered to himself,""In that case, anger can be combined with fire, and fire can be combined with many other things. If a Tiger can devour one Dao, can't it devour other great DAOs? It was definitely possible to devour them naturally and not forcefully merge them together ... Therefore, 10000 DAOs ... Would definitely be able to be simplified greatly, and all similar DAOs and DAOs from the same source would be completely integrated together! This way, it will be more orderly ..."He just had a sudden idea to change the Tiger into the world of wrath, but in the end, the Tiger swallowed the world of wrath!More importantly, Li Hao discovered that his strength had not weakened at all."That's why great DAOs can be combined continuously. In the end, they will only form a certain number of DAOs that can't be combined. This is also what we're pursuing ... However, it's more complicated than simply combining all DAOs into one!"Zhan Tiandi, do you understand this logic?It was possible that he understood it. A Dao with spirituality could reveal such characteristics. However, Zhan Tiandi did not seem to have left any clues on purpose. It was not until today that Li Hao sensed something special about him during an accidental exploration."Great DAOs ... Can be merged like this?"Li Hao bared his teeth. At this moment, he was really happy.He was just trying!The Tiger in front of him seemed to be a little unhappy, while Li Hao looked at the Tiger excitedly.""You can devour anger, but what else can you devour?""Also, can you spit it out at any time?"This Tiger was clearly just expressing his own emotions, but at this moment, Li Hao was talking to the Tiger.The Tiger was very unhappy. It suddenly spat out the little realm in disdain, as if it felt that the little realm wasn't very delicious.As for Li Hao ... He seemed to see the first time he saw the time star. He seemed to have the same kind of intelligence!Right!In the past, he had thought that it was just a combination of great DAOs that naturally produced such an effect. But now that he thought about it again, that was not right. It was actually a spirit. A certain Dao in Time and Stars had a spirit, which was why it was acting like this.……Li Hao was extremely excited.However, the people outside were frowning.This was because the other four had already made it to the 4000th or 5000th square. The faster ones had already made it to the 5000th square, while Li Hao was still stuck at the 3000th square. Although they felt that there was still a gap, they felt that the Silver Moon King ... Was not even inferior to the rude human King, right?But now?There were almost 5000 human Kings, but the Silver Moon King was still at 3000.'What ... What's going on?……However, Li Hao didn't care about that at all. He only played chess for the sake of enlightenment.At this moment, he suddenly had a big harvest, so he was naturally overjoyed. He didn't care about anything else. Besides, he didn't set a time, so what was he anxious about?He had to perfect his own Dao first!  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, a fierce tiger appeared in front of him. Li Hao was extremely excited. He displayed countless little realms one by one, as if he was teasing a puppy."Do you want to eat this?""Owwuuu!""How about this?""Roar!"That fierce tiger seemed to be enraged and very unhappy.Eat anything?That one Spirit could support ten thousand DAOs!This Tiger also seemed to be very picky with its food.But ... When Li Hao took out another Jie, the Tiger swallowed it despite its anger. Li Hao's eyes lit up. Was this ... Burning?Burning and fire were somewhat similar, but they were not completely the same.But now, it had been devoured by the Tiger.In Li Hao's eyes, his fire elemental realm had become even more powerful. It was no weaker than the two separate elemental realms from before. On the contrary, it looked stronger. However, on the surface, it only looked like there was one elemental realm and a ferocious Tiger!"This ..."Li Hao quickly calculated. At present, he didn't know how many great DAOs the Tiger could devour, but it definitely wouldn't be a small number. The related great DAOs could probably be completely devoured and integrated.This way, although there were still many great DAOs in the entire chaos, they should be able to merge in the end.He had merged many great DAOs!Of course, it could also be split.However, he could try to simplify the great Dao. The simpler the great Dao, the better."Divine text ... Different divine texts fusing together ... One divine text, one Dao, but when combined together, they can form a complete, super-strong great Dao!"Thinking about the future, Li Hao seemed to have grasped many key points."There shouldn't be so many DAOs in the future. They should be simplified and refined! It can combine many DAOs of similar nature to form a great Dao. Normally, you can cultivate the divine text and combine them through the divine text ..."" 100 DAOs fused into one super powerful rule path?"Li Hao thought for a moment. He wasn't sure. He had only just discovered this special trait. He didn't know how much a Tiger could swallow. Besides, if he wanted to know, he had to have a complete set of it.His current self was not enough."No... Even if I can't swallow it now, the Tiger should be able to sense it when I'm passing by ... This way, I'll be mentally prepared!"Li Hao was excited.Right!Dao chess. In Dao chess, there were all kinds of moves."I'm still in the middle of the competition. I almost forgot that I can hold the Tiger's hand and experience different DAOs. If there are similar DAOs, the Tiger should be interested.

Chapter 3556 Spirit (3)_6
This time, Li Hao was excited.Soon, he stood up, and the illusionary Tiger appeared in front of him. It seemed a little unhappy, but it still rushed forward madly. However, it would stop for a moment when it passed by some DAOs, as if it wanted to eat them ... But it also seemed to dislike the power of the great DAOs. They were all dead things!Li Hao followed behind him and recorded!This fierce tiger was actually his own Dao, his own God. In reality, he was the one asking the Dao. However, the perception of a God was stronger than his own body.At this moment, Li Hao was leading the Tiger forward excitedly.4,000 great Dao, 5000 great Dao ...Li Hao, who had stayed for a long time, suddenly started to charge.​ ……The other venerable sovereigns were also speechless.This person had been staying in the 3000 great Dao for a long time. Why did he suddenly go crazy?In the blink of an eye, it had reached five thousand.……At this moment, Kong Ji, who had just come out of seclusion, was also observing from the crowd. Seeing this scene, he seemed to recall the time when he played chess with Li Hao. This guy had never been very focused on playing chess.It was ... Dao enlightenment!Could it be that he had gained new insights after staying for such a long time?Thinking about this, Kong Ji was a little envious. This guy was a genius, a peerless genius!He definitely had some comprehension.More importantly, he seemed to have gained something every time. This was something that he had to admire. For many people, the path they had taken was actually not worth much.Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to be completely different. More importantly, this guy dared to overturn some of his insights.Even if it was his own Dao, if he felt that it was wrong, after a period of time, he would overthrow it, or even overturn it!At this moment, a familiar voice rang in his ears.""Fellow Daoist ... Do you ... Know me?"Kong Ji was startled for a moment, but in the next moment, he understood!My father!However, he didn't dare to confirm his identity. At this moment, everyone was in an illusory body and their auras were concealed, so it was difficult to determine his identity. However, his father was different. The radiance Thearch felt that he was somewhat familiar.He was also afraid that he might call the wrong person his son ... And that would make him an enemy.It was not appropriate!Only then did he call out 'fellow Daoist' in his original voice. This way, if he was really his son, they would recognize him.Kong Ji couldn't help but laugh.It was really ..."I don't ..." He deliberately changed his voice.Bang! Bang!In the next moment, the light Thearch's old fist smashed over, making Kong Ji feel a little dazed."I'm using the language of light. Don't you recognize your father?"Like I said, it's somewhat similar!He subconsciously used the language of light, but this kid said he didn't know him!I'll beat you to death! The surrounding figures were all shocked. Are you two crazy?The five tyrants are having a competition, and you two are fighting here?As for Kong Ji, he was helpless as well. He hurriedly pressed his father down and sent a message,""Father, don't mess around. This isn't the right time ..."Light Emperor, on the other hand, was a little happy. He hurriedly sent a message,""Have you reached the eighth rank?"After all, he was an eighth-rank spiritual body, but he was instantly suppressed by his son. Had this guy reached the eighth-rank?"Almost ...""What do you mean by almost the same?""I did, but I'm very weak. I don't want to say I'm at level 8."“……”Light Thearch was speechless, but Kong Ji quickly said,""Let's not talk about this for now. Father, Haoyue has probably gained something again. This time.....I think he can win!"The radiance Thearch was stunned. Are you sure?Kong Ji didn't pay attention to his father. Instead, he looked at Li Hao and felt happy. He must have found something. Li Hao had always been calm and unhurried, but once he took action, he was frighteningly fast.At this moment, although he was still behind the others, he would definitely be able to surpass them soon!……BOOM!The sixth sound rang out.Li Hao excitedly rode the Tiger and kept moving forward, recording all the places the Tiger stopped.The surrounding venerable sovereigns were a little surprised when they heard the sixth sound.In fact, no one was in a hurry. Even if the human King was in a hurry, he would still comprehend as he walked to reduce his losses. In the end, everyone had only passed 6000 when Li Hao, who had not moved at all, instantly broke through 6000.This speed ... Was a little fast."Young man, you just can't wait!"At the side, the human King grinned. At this moment, he no longer considered himself a young man.It was easy for him to reach 6000. He was prepared to take it slow and was not in a hurry.In the end, the little guy next door was getting anxious.Just as he was thinking about this, after a while ... BOOM!The seventh sound rang out.The human King was stunned!He was not the only one. The other venerable sovereigns were also slightly stunned. They all looked at Li Hao in surprise ... 7000 Yuan was nothing, but why did he suddenly leave so fast?……The venerable sovereigns below were also dumbfounded."It's fine if they didn't leave, but once they left ... Seven thousand in one go. So many seventh and eighth rank venerable sovereigns are only at this level ... Some eighth rank venerable sovereigns aren't even at this level ... This is too fast!""As expected of the Daoist master of the heavenly Daoist sect ... Even if he lost in the end, it's still very terrifying!""Did I cheat? I think I heard ... A tiger's roar?"Some people were a little puzzled. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Immediately after that, there was movement in the other four directions. The few people who had been preparing to rest and comprehend suddenly sped up. In the blink of an eye, the 7000 great Dao had been destroyed by them!

Chapter 3557 Spirit (3)_ 7
The five venerable sovereigns had successfully crossed the 7000 Dao laws!This scene also made countless people envious.This was a top venerable sovereign.Some of the level eight venerable sovereigns in the crowd were dumbfounded. They had tried before, but it was really difficult to reach seven thousand. No one had reached eight thousand yet.The key was that these people were shockingly fast.From the beginning until now, it had only been a short while."The human King ... The Silver Moon King, can you still continue on?"Those at the 8th rank transmitted a message to each other. They only knew how difficult it was after walking through it.8,000 Doug AG ... Not everyone could pass that, right?"It's hard to say ... Let's see ... Let's see if they cheated. Of course, we'll see if they have any shame ...""It's not that bad, right?""Who knows? just look at the Silver Moon King. He instantly passed by 7000 Doug AG. I suspect ... He cheated!"All of a sudden, some venerable sovereigns were speechless. This ... Was it really necessary?Cheating in order to win?However, Dao chess was Li Hao 's. Perhaps, it was really possible. Li Hao had reached 7000 too quickly.The next moment, everyone was certain that Li Hao had cheated!At this moment, a loud boom resounded and the sound appeared again.Li Hao!It had broken through eight thousand!"This ... This is definitely cheating!""Shameless!""I thought that the human King was shameless. In the end, he's just a Jackal of the same tribe!""Will huntian and the other sovereigns admit to it? After all, it's tens of billions of great Dao crystals!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "I'm not sure ... But from what I can see, even if he wins, the others might not acknowledge him!"In the blink of an eye, it had exceeded 8000. Who would believe it?……At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns all looked in Li Hao's direction.Even the human King was no exception.Not only that, the human King couldn't help but shout,""Li Hao, you cheated?"If you want to cheat, then just do it. Why did you make such a big fuss?We have to keep a low profile!You're obviously cheating. Who's going to give you a Dao crystal!At this moment, the illusory scene covering Li Hao suddenly disappeared. Li Hao was riding a fierce tiger and smiling at them. The venerable sovereigns all looked at him.The people below were whispering. When they saw the Tiger, they all felt that it was indeed so!However, the others were all slightly stunned. "God?" huntian Supreme Emperor took a look and his eyes flickered.This was a kind of God!It was not a simple spiritual body, but a special God."Spirit!"Li Hao smiled and corrected her.Huntian was stunned, but in the next moment, he seemed to have understood something. His expression changed slightly and he nodded."No wonder! Unbelievable ... After finishing the 8000 squares, I'll have to have a good chat with fellow Daoist!"On the other side, Chunqiu and long Zhan's voices could be heard,""The rules? It's indeed an extraordinary sound ... Is it your own, or does it originally exist?""Heart fire!"Li Hao replied. The next moment, he disappeared and concealed himself.The rest of them quieted down and started to break through the levels.God!Spirit?Interesting, very interesting. At this moment, they were looking forward to having a detailed conversation with Li Hao.They were no longer surprised that Li Hao had reached the 8000th square.Even the human King's eyes flickered. God!Momentum!The Silver Moon's force, turning a spirit into a spirit? He was also looking forward to it, but he was also a little speechless. Why were you so generous?Why would he tell these guys?He could just secretly fix it!It was too high-profile!Unlike me, I'm a low-key person.However, that was just a thought ... In the next moment, the human King also held a large saber in his hand and pressed forward with an indomitable will. Keeping a low profile was one thing. Everyone knew that he was keeping a low profile, but this time, he had to suppress them no matter what!As for the others, they seemed to have been stimulated as well. They broke through the levels at an extremely fast speed.The 8,000 checkpoint was as difficult as ascending to the heavens for a rank eight. However, not long after, the other people broke through it almost at the fastest speed possible, leaving the venerable sovereigns dumbfounded.Even those grade 8s were shocked. Was the gap really that big?The 8,000 Dao brothers that no one had been able to break before had been broken by five people in a row today, and it felt like they still had some energy left. This time, would anyone be able to break 9000?According to the way of chess, those who could reach nine thousand were all ninth-grade comprehensions!The venerable sovereigns, who had originally thought that the outcome was obvious, were now uncertain. Who would win this time?And the Silver Moon King's Tiger seemed to be different.From the looks of the others ... It didn't seem to be a product of cheating. What was that?Why was he able to help the Silver Moon King quickly break through the chess pieces?For a time, everyone was looking forward to the results even more.

Chapter 3558 The Collision Of The Present And The Past (1)
Eight thousand great Dao breakthrough!The five venerable sovereigns had broken through the 8000 Dao laws almost at the same time.At this moment, Li Hao was extremely excited. He suddenly raised his head, looked at the sky, and said,""Dao chess!"The Dao chess pieces appeared.Was he cheating?That's good!After all, I'm the master of this place.He could cheat.To her surprise, Li Hao didn't mention this. Instead, he said,""Five plates in one! He wanted to ask the other venerable sovereigns if they were willing to do so. We've already broken through 8000 squares and are all qualified to participate. It's meaningless to split up now. Five disks combine into one and discuss the Dao!"Dao Qi was stunned.Five games in one?In other words, everyone was under the same chess board. Was this ... Appropriate?Were the others willing to do so?This was because at this level, others might be able to spy on him.However, since Li Hao said so, the Dao chess didn't say anything more. Soon, the other areas all showed the Dao chess's virtual image."Seniors, Supreme Emperor Hao Yue has something to say. He wants to combine the five disks into one and discuss the Dao. Do you have any opinions?"Although they were enemies, this was a rare opportunity.Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for these few people to sit together and discuss Dao.But today ... He had a chance.Over 8,000 squares meant that they were all true rank-8. The so-called true rank-8 meant that everyone had a chance to break through to rank-9. Those who couldn't make it to more than 8000 squares were still far from rank-9!What was the point of such an existence talking about the grade 9 path?At this moment, the few of them thought for a while. Very quickly, huntian Daoist laughed."Sure!""No problem!""I have no objections!""As you wish!"The four powerhouses agreed almost at the same time.Thus, at this moment, the five games could be combined into one. The people below were slightly stunned and there was an instant commotion. Then, the voice of the go board sounded,""The five venerable sovereigns have decided to combine the five games into one and walk and discuss Dao at the same time ...""This ... This ..."An eighth level venerable sovereign couldn't help but ask,""Do ... Do we have the right to listen?"Level eight venerable sovereign!Ask if you have the right to listen.Many venerable sovereigns sighed at his words. This was the temptation of top venerable sovereigns. At Li Hao's level, he wasn't very strong, but this was a place to discuss Dao. Dao Qi said,"no!" It's not that I don't want to, but ... You haven't reached the eight thousand Dao brothers level yet, so you'll only be at a loss and even lose your direction. At this stage, comprehending more Dao laws might be your only way out ... You might not benefit from what they're saying. ""If you want to enter the ninth rank, you have to have 8000 Dao gouges. Whether it's strength or comprehension, you have to at least have one thing. If you don't have either ... Then the path to the ninth rank will be far, far away!"At this moment, Dao Qi sighed.Those who didn't reach 8000 Dao gouges had almost no chance of reaching Grade 9. Even if there were many grade 8 Dao gouges, how many of them could reach 8000?It might be possible for the Supreme martial artist of neo martial arts, but the other level eights ... It was hard to say.None of the current eight steps had passed eight thousand squares.……Li Hao was naturally not interested in saying anything.It wasn't about sharing or not, but that they really hadn't reached that stage. Even if you told them, they wouldn't understand. College students teaching calculus to primary school students would be a waste of time.The five games quickly merged into one.At this moment, only when everyone was united could they see exactly how far they had walked. Li Hao was in the lead and had reached around 8200 squares. As for the other four, the human King was madly slashing forward and was almost at 8100 squares.As for the other three, they had just broken through 8000 slots not long ago, and the distance between them was about the same.At this moment, it was actually a little strenuous.This was also the first time the five of them were on the same stage. It was only at this moment that they knew the exact situation of the others.When Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn, who looked like a little girl, saw that the human King was killing ... She suddenly laughed and said,""Human King, so what if you've hacked to the end?""That means that the so-called space is one with thousands of DAOs, and can be broken with a single blade!"The moment these words came out, long Zhan also punched out a fist!The Dragon's Roar reverberated as he nodded his head slightly,""I agree with the human King's words. It's good that all DAOs are one, and it's good that space is unparalleled. With enough power, it can be broken!" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "The Dao of chaos is a mess," he said."Everyone is sorting it out. In the process, we'll get rid of the weeds and keep the fine ones. Some unnecessary leaves can be cut down to leave the essence behind!" The human King continued,"old dragon, you're right!" All DAOs belong to me, and I am all DAOs. I am the Dao, and the Dao is in my body. Every step I take is a step taken by the Dao. What you all see is me forcing my way through, but you don't know that this is my Dao!"It wasn't an excuse, and it was meaningless.He really thought so.I am the Dao, and the Dao is me. I move forward, and the Dao moves forward. So, why do you care if I comprehend the Dao or not?At this moment, Li Hao quickly nodded.""I've thought about it before. If the cells are the world and the blood is the river, what is Dao? Pulse? I don't know. The Dao is hidden in the world, but the Dao of the human King is to cultivate one's self and break the Dao with a blade. I agree with that!"After saying that, he suddenly collapsed. His cells appeared one by one and instantly merged with the world.Countless worlds appeared in an instant.The boundaries appeared and began to combine, forming a Li Hao ...This scene made the venerable sovereigns 'eyelids Twitch. The human King's eyes flickered as well. He cultivated the inner world, and the so-called inner world was actually the hidden Dao domain.However, Li Hao ... Was no longer hiding his Dao domain!

Chapter 3559 The Collision Of The Present And The Past (2)
What was this?'I am the world, I am the chaos?'"Chaos?" the human King's eyes were a little solemn."Turning oneself into chaos?""You can understand it that way!"Li Hao nodded and continued to move forward. The Tiger continued to lead the way, and Li Hao's voice was a little ethereal."Transform into Primal Chaos, and use my life as the source! "Chaos has an origin, and life has an origin. Today, I have some ideas. I'll turn chaos into my own world. I'll live forever. Perhaps that's the true meaning of immortality ...""Is chaos a person?" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "Dao of Dao!" Huntian murmured. When Li Hao revealed the true essence of his Dao, he no longer hid it like before. He suddenly exhaled, which turned into a strong wind that swept across the world and instantly killed hundreds of Dao gugs.He instantly appeared not far behind Li Hao and said in a deep voice,""The Dao of chaos is extremely chaotic. If it is as you said, chaos is a person, why ... Is it so chaotic? He was injured? He's dead? Or what?" Li Hao shook his head.At this moment, even further behind, long Zhan's gaze changed. He suddenly turned into a giant dragon, and his strong life force swept out in all directions like a bright sun. He also instantly advanced very far away, and his voice was heavy,""You said that the source of life is the life of a human ... Or the life of a living being. Doesn't that mean that we, the Hundun race, are all derived from the foundation of life? "Then why was the world born ... According to you, it was cell replacement? A destroyed world is a cell that has died of old age, and a new world is a new cell?""I don't know,"Li Hao shook his head."Maybe, maybe not. But it can be compared to this!"They were all talking, and only Spring Autumn was listening.The little girl seemed to be a little confused and a little solemn. Suddenly, the Dao GE withered and shattered. She walked as if she was walking on flat ground. After 8000 units, she was still as relaxed as a child and a little excited."One year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year, one year ... Time is merciless. It's said that mole crickets don't know spring and autumn, but my name ... Is spring and autumn!"The spring Autumn Emperor, the Overlord of the South, was suddenly in high spirits. His small frame was unruly and he was no longer laughing. Instead, he seemed to have fallen into oblivion."When I was weak, I once met a great ROC. The great ROC rose with the wind and soared up to ninety thousand li! The great ROC mocked me, the mole cricket doesn't know spring and autumn, doesn't know the vastness of the world, doesn't know the vicissitudes of time ..."She suddenly revealed a mocking expression."Therefore, I cultivated the Dao. I cultivated the Dao of spring and autumn, and the Dao of withering! I know the spring and autumn, I see the world, but that's all there is to it. The so-called great Peng can fly 90000 li, but it's not as good as my time of withering!"Mole cricket ...At this moment, Li Hao was completely sure that the main body was indeed ... Unbelievable. It was just cold cicada! This was a kind of life in spring and Death in Summer, and life in summer and death in autumn.They couldn't see spring and autumn, and they couldn't see them at the same time. Their lifespans were extremely short, and even among insects, they were extremely fragile existences. Among the demon race, their lifespans were too short, and they almost couldn't become demons!But now ... There was a thousand-year cicada in this place!It was hard for ordinary people to imagine how much effort he had put in. A mole cricket that could only live for a few months had become the Overlord of the entire Southern chaotic region!As for the spring Autumn Emperor, she wasn't boasting. Her thoughts were different from the others. At this moment, she took a step forward and stood behind Li Hao. She seemed to have fallen into a deathly silence, as if she had fallen into hell."Haoyue, time Withers and prospers. I have countless people of the same race who have died of longevity! "Our clan has a short lifespan. Spring lives and summer dies, summer lives and autumn dies. I want to ask, why is time so heartless? Some of the trash from the demon race can live for tens of millions of years, but why is our race ... So lowly?""The human Emperor said to fight, and I fought for countless years. I experienced life and death every year, and I changed my body every year. I have changed thousands of bodies, so why can't I let my race live forever?"She was so young, not because she liked it, but because ... Mole crickets had limited lifespans, and that was the case even for someone of her level.Moreover, it was extremely troublesome.If they didn't want to die, they had to keep molting.At this moment, the only reason she came to see Li Hao was to ask why Shi Guang was mistreating her race.He also wanted to know how to resist!She was the only one in cold cicada clan who had broken the reincarnation of life and death. Time was not enough to kill her. Almost none of the other clansmen had succeeded in cultivating it. In just a few months, she could not break the limit of life and death, even though she was extremely talented!This ... Was an extremely sorrowful and unbelievable thing. Spring and autumn had broken the limit!At this moment, even the domineering and proud human King was slightly stunned.A demon who could only live for a few months had actually made it this far. Even he felt that this little girl looked young, but in reality ... She was definitely extremely difficult to deal with!For such an existence to be able to go from the lowest and most powerless stage to this step, he was actually much more terrifying than those who were born powerful.As for Li Hao, he pondered for a while and said,""All living things in the world must have their own strengths. The fittest survive. Cold cicada has existed for countless years and has never gone extinct. How can it only live in spring and die in summer, live in summer and die in autumn ... The withering of time, isn't it the key to your cultivation? When my lifespan is up, I'll sleep in the earth and come back to spring in the next year ..."Spring Autumn shook his head,'that's still a new life! You're no longer in your old body. If you give birth to a son, will your son still be you? Haoyue, you're just brushing me off!"
