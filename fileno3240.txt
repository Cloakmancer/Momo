Heaven's Fate and King Huai exchanged a glance and instantly nodded.It was safe here.The sixth level venerable sovereign had been killed, and the rest of the people were just small fries. If they were to follow them in search of a seventh level venerable sovereign, it would be very dangerous if anything happened.At this moment, the two of them were a little happy.Look, the Silver Moon King knows us well and knows that we are afraid of death. It seems that we have a good character.……Li Hao didn't stay on planet Tianhuang for long.The most important thing now was to get rid of the remaining tier 7 experts in the vicinity.Previously, the Thunderbolt master had said that there was a high chance that it was in the Earth Dragon World. It was said that the Earth Dragon sovereign in the Earth Dragon World was at the peak of the sixth rank a long time ago. It might have entered the seventh rank, but the seventh rank did not appear out of thin air.He definitely had some Foundation.From the looks of it, the Earth Dragon World was probably not too far away from Tianhuang world. However, it would take Li Hao and the others half a day to cross it."Let's go over there!"Kong Ji nodded his head. At this moment, he was filled with confidence.This was the first time he felt that he was still very powerful. So what if he was a seventh rank venerable sovereign?The two of them instantly crossed the void and flew towards the Earth Dragon World in the distance. In reality, they could see that world from here. However, to them, it would still take time to get there.……At the same time.Earth Dragon World.Unlike the other world overlords, who either walked the primal Chaos or floated beside the world gate, this world had a natural trend of development. The world Overlord, the Earth Dragon Thearch, had not appeared for a long time.It was said that he had been in a deep sleep.In the empty space of the regional wall, a huge earthly Dragon beast was sleeping. Although it was sleeping, it did not dare to sleep too deeply. It had been watching the surroundings.However, when the Thunderbolt master exploded ... It closed its eyes in peace.The reason it stayed here instead of going on an expedition with the Dragon Lord was for one purpose-to prevent the Thunderbolt Lord from appearing. Its purpose was to pester the Thunderbolt Lord.But now that the Thunderbolt master had appeared in his own world, and was even inviting the flame Phoenix realmlord to join him, it no longer had anything to do with him.He could finally go back to sleep.His mission could be considered to be completed. This was not bad at all. He did not need to fight with the lightning Lord. Otherwise, even if the lightning Lord had left the Thunder World, he would still be quite strong. He might not be able to defeat the other party.After sleeping for a while, the giant Earth Dragon suddenly opened its eyes.The power of a Grade 7 and the might of a great Dao made it feel that something was not right.Its huge body instantly stood up.Its eyes, which were like the sun, suddenly looked into the distance. That was where the realm gate was. Because it was sleeping here, it didn't care about the realm gate and wasn't afraid that someone would enter this place through the realm gate. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  As a seventh rank venerable sovereign and a member of the chaos race, it was not afraid of those dangers. However, at that moment, the earthly Dragon beast sensed a hidden danger.In an instant, it saw it! What the Tianhuang Thearch saw were cats and dogs. However, what the Earth Dragon venerable saw were not cats and dogs. He ignored them and looked at the two unremarkable humans beside the dog's ears!The human race?At that moment, the Earth Dragon Thearch was shocked. It was not that there were no humans in the Dragon Realm, but how would humans dare to enter a Tier 6 world?The moment Li Hao and Kong Ji entered ... They were both slightly shocked. They were actually right below the regional wall.This guy, a Dragon?It looked like a dragon ... But Li Hao had seen Dragons before. Unlike ordinary Dragons, this Dragon was somewhat ugly.Was this the Earth Dragon?In an instant, he knew that this was a rank seven venerable sovereign.In his eyes, it was not an earthly Dragon beast, but an extremely thick Dao. It was the chaos Dao that seemed to be rooted in the depths of chaos. It was different from the human race's rank seven itinerant cultivators, who cultivated Dao domains.The daoless domain could not achieve the seventh rank.However, chaos beasts were different. They only attached their great Dao to their chaos mixed Dao and absorbed the power of Chaos. Even if they only had one great Dao, they were strong enough to step into grade seven.However, the human body was almost unable to withstand the brutal and chaotic power of chaos.The difference between a Chaos Beast with a seventh-tier universe and one without a seventh-tier universe was ... One could purify its own chaos energy, while the other couldn 't. The former looked more gentle, while the latter was more violent.In the next moment, the Nirvana realm appeared and covered the entire world. However, the Nirvana power was instantly destroyed the moment it reached the earthly Dragon beast!The huge earthly Dragon beast came back to its senses at this moment.Looking at the two beasts and two humans in front of him, his eyes instantly turned cold."Human?"Such courage!It didn't care about the human race. It was just a little shocked that these two people dared to enter its world!Obviously, these two people were not advanced venerable sovereigns, nor were they the lightning Masters.As for where it came from, it didn't care.It was only confused. When they saw it ... The first thing they did was not run away, but ... Attack!One of them had unleashed a Nirvana world, and Li Hao's actions were even more confusing.At this moment, Li Hao suspended Time and stars in the air. The long river of the great path surrounded the entire world, and small worlds appeared instantly, almost enveloping the entire Level 6 world!This ... Covered the world?What did that mean?The Earth Dragon was in a daze for a moment. The four middle-stage venerable sovereigns had entered their own world and saw him. They did not run away or do anything else but ... Quickly covered the sky and earth.It was a little confused. Could it be that these two people didn't see through its strength?His eyes didn't seem to be that good!

Chapter 3241 Killing A Tier 7 (3)
The next moment, the Earth Dragon beast moved. Li Hao shouted,""Kong Ji, go!"Kong Ji didn't say a word and instantly charged forward!Li Hao, on the other hand, was still weaving his own Dao web. He had to completely seal off this place. Otherwise, once the battle broke out, the Nirvana world would not be able to be completely concealed if he went all out in a battle between Level 7 experts.The only way was to use the river of time to suppress it! Not only that, but the two Dao Masters also appeared instantly. The great Dao universe enveloped the periphery, almost enveloping the entire sixth-tier world. In the surroundings, some small realms were densely embedded, instantly covering the entire sixth-tier world.In front of him, Kong Ji was already fighting with his opponent.In an instant, the battle erupted.The seventh-rank earthly Dragon beast's strength was not fake. A powerful and shocking chaotic force burst out. With a loud boom, the other party swept its tail and the entire space, even the world barrier, was shattered!It was unbelievably powerful!Kong Ji had been full of confidence before. In addition, he and Li Hao had gained an advantage when they fought the Thunderbolt master, who was at the peak of the seventh rank. He wanted to fight head-on, so he pointed his finger. Light and darkness appeared, and life and death erupted!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the heavens and the earth. The finger was instantly shattered, and Kong Ji's entire body trembled! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  The power of the great Dao instantly dissipated, and only a tiny, invisible blood mark was left on the opponent's huge tail.Kong Ji was stunned!The earthly Dragon beast was also stunned. How ... Could this be possible?Although there was only a little blood on its tail, as a seventh-rank Chaos Beast, its strongest point was its physical body, which was unbelievably strong. They were both seventh-rank human powerhouses, and their Dao was extremely profound.However, the beasts of primordial chaos had the absolute advantage in their physical bodies. This was their strongest technique!The attack methods of chaos beasts were generally similar.The main thing was the strength of his physical body. He could ignore all mantras and directly tear his opponent apart.Of course, some Beasts of Chaos also had their own specialties, such as the fire-elemental power of the fire Phoenix realm and the earth-elemental power of the Earth Dragon beast. They were also very strong defensive powers.In such a state, a sweep of the tail would cause an ordinary Tier 6 to explode in an instant!However ... This person only had his finger broken and had even injured himself."Ming Tang?"In an instant, it seemed to have thought of something. Its eyes turned cold as it looked at Li Hao and Kong Ji."I was wondering who it was, so it's you two! How dare you! Do you really think you are invincible after killing Qi Shui?"It knew who the person was.He also knew why he was so arrogant. He sealed the world the moment he came up.Its huge eyes revealed a cold look."Then you ... Are wrong! Qi River without a world and not fighting on its own land will weaken its power by at least 30%. But to us, the chaos race ... This doesn't exist!"It didn't matter if there was a Dao universe or not. "If you think I'm a weak human who doesn't have much power after leaving the universe, then you're wrong!The seventh rank venerable sovereign of the chaos race and the seventh rank venerable sovereign of the human race were not the same."Silver Moon King, are you trying to build a grave for yourself?"The earthly Dragon beast smiled. It looked at Li Hao and disappeared in an instant.Li Hao, who was still in the sealed world, changed his expression slightly and disappeared from where he was. However, the entire void seemed to be shattered instantly. With a loud bang, a tail as large as a mountain broke through the void and shattered the world!With a loud bang, Li Hao was directly shaken out. He was covered in blood, and his expression changed slightly. So strong!Seventh rank, they had fought before.He had killed Qi Shui, fought the Thunderbolt master, and even suppressed the Thunderbolt master. This made Li Hao and Kong Ji extremely confident. They could kill a Beast of Chaos without a world or a great Dao universe, no matter how strong its body was!But ...Even mid-stage venerable sovereigns like Li Hao and Kong Ji were injured in the first exchange.In the air, a suffocating pressure appeared.The entire world seemed to be covered by a brutal Earth Power, and the entire space seemed to be suppressed by a mountain.The huge earthly Dragon beast's body was huge, but its speed was unimaginably fast. At that moment, its eyes were filled with coldness."New martial and light ... If it were in the three regions, I wouldn't dare to kill you rashly, but this place ... Is the Dragon field!"These two little fellows were really courting death!I thought it was the Thunderbolt master.Not far away, Kong Ji shouted,"destroy the world!"A destructive force exploded between heaven and earth. It was the great destructive force. The entire world seemed to be destroyed in an instant. The aura of death instantly enveloped the other party. However, in the next moment, an extremely thick great Dao appeared. With a boom, it shattered all the destructive force in the surroundings!Unparalleled tyranny!Kong Ji's expression changed completely. Previously, even the lightning Master was affected by his Nirvana world. However, in front of this giant beast, it was actually shattered!How was that possible?"Hmph!"The Earth Dragon beast snorted coldly."The strongest part of the chaos race is their physical body, which is invulnerable to all techniques. Unless you're much stronger than me ... Your great Dao power can't destroy my physical body at all!" He thought.My Dao is attached to chaos. How powerful is chaos?Can you be destroyed?Rank seven Beasts of Chaos did not have as many techniques as rank seven venerable sovereigns of the human race. However, in terms of individual strength, no one in the human race could match them.Kong Ji's expression was solemn. The next moment, six stars appeared in his hand. Life, death, destruction, revival, light, and darkness appeared at the same time. The entire world exploded with an extremely powerful aura.

3242 Chapter 528
Six paths, three extremes!"Kill!"Since Nirvana couldn't destroy this guy, then he would use violence to solve it.The earthly Dragon beast disappeared again and reappeared in front of Li Hao in the blink of an eye, as if it had teleported. This time, it did not attack with its tail, but with its claws, trying to kill Li Hao!As for Li Hao, he had just formed a sword of a thousand DAOs. Seeing this, he roared and slashed out. Time appeared, trying to freeze his opponent for a moment. However, it turned out that time was still too weak. It only interfered for a moment!BOOM! When the sword and the claw collided, the firmament sword even began to crack. Li Hao's body was directly shattered by the huge shock, and a bloody mark appeared on the other party's claw ... That was all!At this moment, both Li Hao and Kong Ji's expressions changed.How could he be so powerful?No, it could be said that the other party's techniques were ordinary, but his physical body was so strong that it had exceeded their expectations. It was too strong!Li Hao's thousand world sword had even shaken the Thunderbolt master's great Dao and split his body, while his opponent only had a bloody scar!The earthly Dragon beast trembled as well. In the next moment, a loud laugh was heard."So that's how it is. Not weak. No wonder you two dared to kill me ... So You Think I'm like Qi River because of your powerful techniques?"It suddenly raised its head and looked at the star that was covering it in the void. Its eyes moved slightly. What kind of power was this?Freeze me!This was ...Before it could think further, Li Hao and Kong Ji suddenly gathered and used the power of Nirvana at the same time. They both roared, and the entire Level 6 world seemed to be annihilated. Everyone and everything fell into a deathly silence!The earthly Dragon beast paused for a moment, but then moved again. Its tail swept out like a mountain, crushing everything beneath it. It swept the destructive power of the two men away.A small trick!I'm invulnerable to all techniques!The true path of strength was to overcome ten with one's own strength.Li Hao's expression was grave. He glanced at Kong Ji, who looked at him. The next moment, Kong Ji roared, and the world suddenly shattered. A small flower appeared in front of Kong Ji. Li Hao instantly devoured it, and his aura soared!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  As the long sword appeared, Dao domains instantly stacked together.The five-element Dao domain, the life and death Dao domain, the Nirvana and recovery Dao domain ...Dao domains descended one after another and were continuously shattered by the earthly Dragon beast. The other party was also shocked. There were so many Dao domains. Were these two really middle-stage venerable sovereigns?These Dao domains enveloped the earthly Dragon beasts, but they were quickly shattered.That extremely powerful tail was like a wall-breaking machine that could easily suppress a Grade 6 Dao domain. However, at this moment, it was like a thin piece of paper that shattered with a touch.This was a true top venerable sovereign!This was the true strength of a human Supreme Emperor after they occupied a world and exerted the power of the great path and the universe. Li Hao and the others had not even exerted their peak strength when they fought a level Seven Supreme Emperor.It was either not in their own territory, or like the Thunderbolt master, they did not dare to use it. They were not at their peak.As for chaos beasts, they could reach the peak at any time.At this moment, a dog's paw appeared in the darkness. In an instant, it appeared behind the huge beast of primordial chaos. Nine layers erupted, and waves surged into the sky. With a loud bang ... Kacha!The claws broke!The Black Panther grunted as it was sent flying backward, blood gushing out of its body. Meanwhile, the earthly Dragon beast looked at it with disdain. There was only a slight scratch on its huge back!Yes, it healed almost in the blink of an eye.The Black Panther's eyes were filled with disbelief ... When Li Hao's group attacked just now, they didn't hurt the other party too badly, so it didn't feel it clearly. But now, when it launched a sneak attack, the other party didn't seem to notice ...From the looks of it now, it wasn't that he didn't notice, but rather ... He didn't care.As expected, it only left a scratch and instantly healed.This ... Was this the difference between the fifth and seventh rank?Instantly, Black Panther became somewhat dejected!So strong!In the sky, the power of the two great Dao universes exploded. The river came pressing down, but it also froze instantly. The river could not suppress it at all. A chaos great Dao appeared and stirred the river!The two rank five Dao Masters instantly merged together, but they still couldn't block it!Under the fusion of the two Dao Masters, even an ordinary rank six might not be a match for them.However, at this moment, they were vulnerable in front of this rank seven venerable sovereign."Small tricks! You dare to make a fool of yourself?""The great Dao universe ... Hahaha!"The earthly Dragon beast laughed.I actually picked up a great Dao universe. Is this Silvermoon's great Dao universe?"Haoyue ... We're in big trouble!"At this moment, Kong Ji's expression was extremely serious. This was really troublesome. Before, he had been insufferably arrogant and thought that a tier 7 could be easily killed. However, when they really fought, he realized that although the other party didn't have any special abilities, just his powerful physical body alone was difficult to break through!What was this good?No matter how many DAOs one had, no matter how fancy they were, if their quality was not up to par, it would be difficult to break through the other party's defense. This ... Was really troublesome.The other party had few tricks up his sleeve and could only attack head-on, which was why he hadn't been able to kill them quickly. But if this continued ... His and Li Hao's great DAOs would be limited, while the other party's physical strength would always be there!If this continued, they would definitely lose!Li Hao didn't say anything, but his surprise was everywhere. It could only be said that he and Kong Ji had both substituted the chaos beasts for the human race, and felt that chaos beasts without a Dao universe were the same as humans without a Dao universe ...

This was the foundation.Only by experiencing it would one understand that he would not make such a mistake again, provided that there would be a next time."Powerful fleshly body ...."Li Hao's eyes flickered. A strong body meant that one's mind might not be strong. It was impossible for the Beasts of Chaos to be truly invincible. Otherwise, a human venerable sovereign would not be able to defeat these guys.At this moment, as he watched his opponent break through his Dao domain again and charge at them, Li Hao suddenly shouted, and monsters appeared behind him!There were Tigers, bears, and deers ...Five birds technique!God-like power!Yuan Shuo's aura instantly condensed behind Li Hao, transforming into a ferocious Tiger. Like the Overlord of the world, it was brimming with violence, appearing and disappearing in an instant."Roar!"The fierce tiger roared and instantly took the initiative to attack the other party!The earthly Dragon beast's claw struck out and the Dao domain in front of it shattered. The Tiger trembled slightly and instantly closed in. In the next moment, what appeared in front of the Tiger was not the earthly Dragon beast but a chaos great Dao!The great Dao shook!With a bang, the Tiger's body trembled, and Li Hao also continuously coughed up blood. However, this ferocious Tiger still roared and bit down ... With a crack, all of its teeth were instantly shattered.However, a small hole had been bitten in the chaos Dao."Hmph ..."The Earth Dragon beast let out a muffled groan as a ferocious glint appeared in its eyes!Yes, their bodies were strong, but because their great Dao was singular and the chaos Dao was brutal, their gods weren't as strong. When they fought with human venerable sovereigns, they often liked to use this method to kill them.The cultivation of the human race was mixed, but the gods were stronger.However ... Under normal circumstances, a strong physical body was enough to crush all gods. A God that was a human race's venerable sovereign was not as invincible as one might imagine."Tiger roar in the forest!"The earthly Dragon beast didn't care. In an instant, it shattered countless Dao domains and appeared in front of Li Hao. Six stars appeared instantly, but they were slapped away by Li Hao's claw!Kong Ji was furious. The next moment, the six stars combined into one. A powerful light force exploded and the fist of the great sun appeared!It was as if the light Emperor had possessed him!A punch was thrown!  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 BOOM!The earthly Dragon beast staggered and Kong Ji's arm was also bleeding from his seven orifices. His arm was directly turned into a pile of flesh, but another arm reappeared in an instant. With a violent roar, he swung his fist again like a mad demon. It was the first time he had displayed such a brutal look!The fist was broken and reappeared one after another. In the blink of an eye, it was broken countless times and then restored countless times. The earthly Dragon beast's aura weakened instantly. Finally, for the first time, a bloody hole was created on the earthly Dragon beast! It took a long time to recover!Li Hao's ferocious Tiger roared and madly bit at the chaos Dao. In a frenzy, it tore a small hole in the chaos Dao."You're looking for death ..."The Earth Dragon beast let out a deafening roar. In the next moment, the entire space seemed to have been frozen. An extremely dense earth element power burst forth, wanting to squeeze the two of them until they exploded!The two of them were not weak at all. Even the earthly Dragon beast felt threatened by their combined strength.If he didn't kill them now, he might suffer.At this moment, a bright moon suddenly appeared between heaven and earth. Ordinary people couldn't touch the Dao of chaos, and Li Hao could only rely on his God to attack. But at this moment, the bright moon appeared instantly and attached itself to the Dao of chaos.A Queen!The Queen was only at the 2nd rank, yet she was able to get close to the chaos Dao.However, even if she could get close, she was too weak. It was impossible for her to shatter this Dao. The Queen didn't do it for the sake of shattering. She knew that she didn't have the ability to do so. If she tried to shatter it by force, she would only shatter herself.At that moment, the Queen chanted softly,""People of the divine Kingdom, pray for me!"In an instant, a powerful power of faith appeared and surged into the chaos great Dao. Countless power of faith surged into it, causing the earthly Dragon beast to tremble slightly!Faith!The influx of faith only brought about a kind of comfort, but it also made people a little addicted. The Earth Dragon beast suddenly roared and expelled this intoxicating feeling. The great Dao trembled, wanting to shake that person to death directly!At this moment, the Queen's moon merged with the great Dao. The Queen was still alive, but Li Hao's expression changed.Countless streams of chaotic energy suddenly appeared in the stars of time in the sky, the brutal and tyrannical energy instantly erupting.That was the Queen ... She was actually extracting the earthly Dragon beasts 'chaotic force. As a stage two, she obviously couldn't digest it, so she transferred it all to Li Hao. In an instant, Li Hao's great Dao was filled with countless violent chaotic force, and he almost split apart!"You ..."Li Hao wanted to curse!Are you trying to kill me?However, he quickly shut his mouth, because the earthly Dragon beast's expression suddenly changed, and its aura weakened a little. Even if it was just a little ... Li Hao's eyes lit up.It was feasible!"Lingyue, speed up the drawing!"Li Hao, who had wanted to curse just now, changed his attitude in the blink of an eye. The Tiger continued to roar and charge at the chaos great Dao. On the other hand, Kong Ji also recovered and exhausted himself. The two of them, one inside and one outside, didn't care about anything else as they madly pestered this guy!As for the bright moon that the Queen had transformed into, because it was connected to the chaos great Dao, it was also doing its best to extract the chaos power in the Earth Dragon great Dao and then transfer it to Li Hao ... Li Hao's eyes had changed. They were somewhat red and somewhat brutal!

Time and Stars trembled slightly. It was clear that the Time and Stars could not withstand the sudden influx of so much great Dao power.The earthly Dragon beast was getting anxious!What kind of people were they?It wasn't afraid of the powerful God Li Hao or the powerful Kong Ji, but ... What was this situation?Someone had actually managed to sneak into his great Dao and extract the power of his chaos great Dao ... This was simply unbelievable. To the chaos race, the chaos great Dao was the foundation.But now, someone had entered their base ... This was equivalent to a seventh-rank venerable Emperor of the human race being infiltrated into the great Dao universe and extracted their power of Dao origin. The last person to do this was Li Hao, and red Moon master had suffered a great loss.But now, a second stage venerable sovereign could extract the power of his great Dao ... This was unbelievable.Its great Dao was shaking violently!The bright moon started to shatter under the impact. However, at this moment, countless power of faith emerged and solidified the moon. The Queen also let out a muffled groan. She was only a rank two, and the opponent's great Dao had only trembled, but she already felt like she was about to die.If Li Hao's ferocious Tiger hadn't been continuously attacking and interfering with his opponent, he would have been killed after a few jolts!So this was a seventh rank venerable sovereign?It was too terrifying!In a head-on battle, a second stage venerable sovereign would probably be slapped to death with a single palm.At the same time.In the sky.The two rivers of the great path continued to spiral. At this moment, Qian Wuliang's voice came out with a bit gentleness and gentleness."Sleep in peace, everything is just an illusion ... It's just a big dream ..."As the two merged, the power of level six burst out, and the river of Dao shook violently. Qian Wuliang couldn't attack Level Seven by force, but he changed his mind.Since the other party was weak in God, he would use other methods to interfere with the other party.A gentle force slowly wrapped around the earthly Dragon beast. It wasn't an attack, but a lullaby! Qian Wuliang's words were as gentle as a mother coaxing her child to sleep!The Earth Dragon beast roared, trying to shatter this force. Its tail almost killed Kong Ji, but the next second, Li Hao waved his hand, and Kong Ji instantly returned to normal. At the same time, dark clouds suddenly appeared in the sky ...BOOM!The primal Chaos tribulation lightning struck the earthly Dragon beast, causing it to tremble. In the next moment, a thought appeared in its mind,"dream on, I'm going to sleep."In the void, Qian Wuliang's face turned pale, but he kept trying to comfort her. Just when he thought he had succeeded, his face suddenly changed.The two rivers of the great Dao suddenly became violent.BOOM!With a loud bang, he was separated from Hong Yitang. The two of them coughed out blood and the power of their DAOs spread wildly. The earthly Dragon beast roared,""You little insects!" Damn it!He was almost hypnotized by that annoying force. These guys were too annoying.And although its strength had started to decline, it was still extremely powerful.Li Hao's side, on the other hand, was injured, but they still couldn't kill the other party.At this moment, Li Hao took a deep breath and shouted in a low voice. The time star in the sky instantly disappeared and reappeared above the earthly Dragon beast's head. Li Hao roared, and countless great DAOs emerged!The stars of time exploded with a dazzling radiance!A freezing force suddenly exploded.Time freeze! The Earth Dragon beast's movements paused. At this moment, it was no longer as strong as before and couldn't instantly break the interference of this energy. A longsword appeared in Li Hao's hand, and the power of a thousand worlds gathered again!At that moment, it was mixed with a large amount of chaotic force, which was extremely brutal. The force came from the earthly Dragon beast itself.The sword slashed down!With a loud boom, a corner of the firmament sword broke, but it also left a deep bloody mark on the opponent's neck. A large amount of blood dripped down.The Earth Dragon beast woke up again from the pain. It broke the time freeze and clawed at Li Hao!  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Kong Ji attacked immediately. This time, the other party destroyed six stars with one claw. Kong Ji was instantly dispirited and shocked. This guy was going all out. He couldn't destroy six stars with one claw before!Li Hao, on the other hand, was not dazed. He continued to interfere with his opponent's great Dao so that the Queen could extract her chaos energy, suppress her with time, and summon the chaos tribulation lightning to strike her ...At the same time, he looked at a cat that was hovering in the void not far away!Second cat!At this moment, er Mao was also watching the battle. He didn't participate in it. However, at this moment, he saw the opponent explode and struggle madly. Er Mao instantly disappeared!The next moment, it suddenly appeared on the side of the chaos great Dao and opened its huge mouth. An extremely powerful devouring force instantly erupted. The earthly Dragon beast, which was focused on killing Li Hao, didn't have time to react when it suddenly felt weak.The Queen had only extracted a portion of the power of Chaos, but the two cats had absorbed more than seventy percent of it in an instant, weakening the earthly Dragon beast instantly!"Emperor Cang ..."The earthly Dragon beast was shocked. How was this possible?An expert who was powerful enough to instantly devour 70% of his great Dao power, a cat ... Who else could it be other than Emperor Cang?BOOM!At that moment, the Tiger roared and broke the fragile chaos great Dao. The power of time burst forth and froze the opponent. In the blink of an eye, dozens of venerable sovereigns appeared. Without saying anything, they attacked with all their might!

Boom! Boom! Boom!In the blink of an eye, the huge body of the earthly Dragon beast was sent flying everywhere. The earthly Dragon beast's eyes were still filled with disbelief as it looked at er Mao. The momentary weakness allowed its opponent to seize the opportunity, and its great Dao was destroyed by Li Hao's divine attack. Although it was not completely dead yet, its Dao was broken, and its physical strength was instantly fading ...BOOM!The fist of the six paths struck again, and with one punch, a huge hole was created in the body that was hard to break before!In the sky, ermao's body expanded rapidly and looked like it was going to explode.At this moment, second cat was a little full. It was not a big cat.The next moment, he opened his mouth and spat out countless streams of Primal Chaos power, which once again surged into Li Hao's River of Dao. Li Hao slashed out with his sword, splitting the Dragon beast in half, but the next second ... His eyes suddenly turned red, and he roared madly!"Second cat!"He roared,"where are you going to insert the chaotic force?"He couldn't take what the Queen had absorbed before. Second cat had swallowed too much and couldn't digest it, so he spat it all into Li Hao's River of Dao.Second cat suddenly felt a little guilty ... You ... Didn't you say that the Qianjie was empty?I think you can absorb it!With so many little realms, wasn't it a good thing to absorb more?Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to have lost control of himself. His mind was filled with violence and madness, like a beast. At this moment, he even had the urge to madly slaughter everyone in his surroundings. Damn cat, damn Queen ... Have you all forgotten that I'm only at the fifth step?The power of the Chaos Beast's great Dao was too brutal. For a moment, the power of the great Dao gushed in crazily, making Li Hao lose control. The interference was even more serious than last time when he was disturbed by the Crimson Moon Dao.These two guys ... They're too much. Although they've made great contributions in this battle, how can they inject chaotic energy into my River of Dao without limit?The tyrannical Li Hao was extremely crazy. He slashed again and again, cutting the dying earthly Dragon beast into countless pieces. The earthly Dragon beast let out a shrill roar and tried to make a final struggle ... But it was crushed into pieces by the Joint Forces of the many venerable sovereigns!Li Hao once again slashed out with his sword. An illusionary figure was directly slashed out of the void. With a boom, the illusionary figure was shattered.The Earth Dragon beast let out a blood-curdling screech, filled with unwillingness!Damn it!"The Dragon Lord won't let you off ..."It had died too unwillingly. Li Hao and void couldn't have killed it if they had joined forces. In the end, it had fallen at the hands of a few weaklings, who had devoured its chaos great Dao.This ... Was a huge threat to the chaos race.At this moment, the earthly Dragon beast not only regretted not paying too much attention to these weaklings, but it was even more afraid that the second stage venerable sovereign had actually integrated with the chaos great Dao!This person actually didn't die! If they survived and continued to grow stronger, they would be able to do the same to other chaos beings in the future ... This was the true threat of the chaos race!This was a threat to the entire race!As for second cat, it only had a strong devouring power, but it was not directly attached to the chaos ... It wanted to spread the news that someone had cultivated the chaos Dao and integrated into the chaos, and was still alive!A wave of fluctuation spread wildly in all directions. This was its last spiritual fluctuation. It wanted to spread the news out. As long as it did ... Even if the Dragon Lord had to give up the three regions, he would definitely return to kill the other party!The cultivators who had completely fused with the chaos and were still alive were the greatest threat to the chaos race!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  It had to be eradicated!The fluctuation shook, and the universe covered the sky. How could Li Hao and the others let this guy pass the message? the Nirvana realm reappeared ... But this fluctuation was the last obsession of the other party before his death. It actually broke through the Nirvana realm in an instant.He was about to break through the obstruction of the long river of Dao and enter the chaos. At that time, he would not be able to control it.At this moment, Li Hao was about to use time freeze.Suddenly, a Dao domain-like black hell appeared, and a scimitar instantly appeared, destroying all fluctuations and covering the entire world with death energy.Lin Hongyu did not say a word. She only looked at the Queen who had turned into the moon not far away.He retreated silently, and a deathly aura appeared in his eyes.This battle ... The rank two queen had actually made a great contribution. The invisible pressure made her feel a little heavy, and even her death aura became much thicker.Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows. He didn't have time to say anything, because the brutal power of the great DAOs was about to burst him!Second cat and the Queen were really unreliable.He didn't have time to think about it. He instantly merged into his River of the great Dao and quickly suppressed all the riots.After he disappeared, Kong Ji sized up the two of them and clicked his tongue. He also quickly disappeared to heal his injuries. Terrifying. It was even more terrifying than killing a level 7. He suspected that Li Hao Ran fast not because he couldn't suppress them, but because he didn't want to stay here.He also ran!As for the others, after sizing up the two of them, they quickly disappeared one by one to recuperate. The entire world instantly fell silent.Only death and holiness were emerging, erupting, and even confronting each other.The Queen transformed into her human form and looked at Lin Hongyu to heal her injuries. Suddenly, her lips moved slightly as she looked at Lin Hongyu with a hint of provocation. She sent a voice transmission,"Old grandaunt!"“……”Killing intent instantly filled the world, and a deathly aura covered the area.The Queen disappeared in the blink of an eye, but she was overjoyed. She was slightly younger than this woman, so even if the other party walked the path of life and death ... Wasn't it the same?The world was completely silent.

Chapter 3246 Seventh-Tier Universe
The Chaos Beast's power of great Dao was much more violent and vigorous than ordinary chaos power.Er Mao and the Queen were unreliable. They couldn't absorb it themselves, so they poured a large amount of chaotic force into Li Hao's River of Dao. At this moment, Li Hao's River of Dao churned violently.Vaguely, there was even a giant beast struggling to appear, as if it was about to be reborn.An Earth Dragon beast!Such a top-notch existence, even after death, was still showing signs of revival ... It was extremely terrifying.This was the strongest stage seven that Li Hao had ever encountered.Or rather, the tier 7 that he had encountered before had not revealed their true strength.When he killed Thearch Qi Shui, Li Hao felt that a level Seven was nothing special.The few Level Seven venerable sovereigns of the red moon world seemed to be even easier to kill. The other party was not even the master of the great path universe, but only an Overlord in the level eight universe. Today, Li Hao truly understood how powerful a level Seven venerable sovereign was when he used his full strength. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He and Kong Ji, who were known as pseudo rank Sevens, together with two cats and the rest, had barely managed to kill the other party. It was because the other party had revealed a flaw, a flaw of the chaos great Dao, or else they would have been in danger!At this moment, Li Hao's small worlds were being filled with energy crazily.Not only that, small worlds started to appear.Beast!At this moment, a small realm rapidly expanded from the river. It was the beast Realm.The way of the wild beast!The illusory image of the earthly Dragon beast seemed to be real. It was imprinted directly into the small realm, full of violence and madness. A divine character of "beast" appeared instantly!It was the first piece of divine text that Li Hao had obtained from a Chaos Beast, the first relatively special great Dao.Beast nature!"Roar!"The roars of beasts resounded through the heavens and the earth. The river rippled and waves surged. Large amounts of Primal Chaos energy were absorbed by this world, and the little world rapidly grew stronger at an unbelievable rate.He even vaguely wanted to connect with the chaotic energy outside.This was the Beast of Chaos.The natural-born Sons of Chaos were much simpler, easier, and freer than human beings in the chaos. Li Hao found it strange that the Beasts of Chaos were so determined to live freely in the world. What was wrong with that?Each had its own advantages and disadvantages. To the Beasts of Chaos, it was also a restriction of the other party's freedom, so why bother?At this moment, the small worlds started to expand.It was very fast!Each small world was filled with at least ten million great Dao crystals. In the blink of an eye, nearly 100 small worlds were filled, which was equivalent to the power of the great Dao that was converted in an instant. There were about one billion great Dao crystals.Just like that, the great Dao crystal that he had given to the lightning Lord previously was made up for.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes were still somewhat fierce.The brutal intent in his heart was a little hard to get rid of.Brutality was also an emotion and a desire. Li Hao kept calming himself down and slowly suppressed it. He could control his emotions quite well. At this moment, Li Hao was continuously absorbing this energy.He silently felt it.At this moment, he was still at the fifth level, but the number of little worlds that had been filled up had already reached more than 700. He should be at the sixth level soon.Moreover, his strength had increased.However, Li Hao was frowning.He discovered a problem with himself.It was a serious problem.The most top-notch sure-kill technique ... Was somewhat lacking. For example, this time, although he knew the sword of a thousand DAOs, which originated from the longevity sword technique, he was still lacking.It also knew how to merge the five elements realm, which originated from the secret technique of five birds.It could even stagnate time, which was the ability of time itself.However, his unique methods, the sure-kill methods ... Were extremely lacking.He had always been cultivating the sword Dao.However, with the longevity sword intent, although Li Hao had improved it and turned it into the bright moon sword intent, it was still the same.The sword of the sword Saint was very powerful!There was no doubt about this. If he was not powerful, how could a sixth rank venerable sword fight against a seventh rank?However ... Li Hao was a latecomer, after all. In terms of swordsmanship, he was not as good as the venerable sword. Li Hao would not be so arrogant as to think that his sword could compare to the venerable sword.At least, Kong Ji could fuse six fists. Even though the six divine fists were a variant of the divine fist of light, the combat power he could unleash was very strong. He had even broken through the physical body of a seventh-order Chaos Beast.Li Hao, on the other hand, had waited for his opponent to weaken before slashing at him.His instantaneous explosive power was actually not as good as the void.The six godly fists were only six, but they were so United that they even surpassed Li Hao's thousand sword techniques."There's no difficulty in dealing with sixth-rank beasts. To deal with seventh-rank beasts ... As long as it's not a Chaos Beast, it's actually possible ..."However, he was now in the Dragon field.The opponents were all chaos beasts, and seventh-order chaos beasts were very normal. If things were to turn out like this time, even if he reached the sixth-order, he might not be able to suppress a seventh-order Chaos Beast."Although there are many great DAOs and realms, they are all a little weak ... Even if they are gathered together, they still lack an instantaneous explosive power ..."Li Hao thought as he suppressed the attack. The next moment, he thought of something, and his expression changed.In the primal Chaos, was the sword Saint the one with the strongest offensive techniques?Or the human King?Or the Dragon Lord?These people were all very strong.The great Dao was also powerful enough!But ... At this moment, Li Hao fell into deep thought as he looked at a small realm in the distance. However, the attack power that everyone, even the human King, was afraid of was actually the power of destruction, the chaos lightning tribulation!

Chapter 3247 Seventh-Tier Universe (2)
The primal Chaos lightning tribulation's lightning energy was not bad, but they were not afraid of the human King. Otherwise, the lightning Lord would be an invincible existence.What everyone was truly afraid of was still the power of destruction!Li Hao, on the other hand, was probably the one who had experienced the most chaos lightning tribulations in the entire primordial chaos. It could be said that no one understood the chaos lightning tribulations more than he did, and no one knew better than him what the power of destruction was.From the inside of the Silver Moon to the present, from being sealed up to walking out ... Li Hao had transcended the Tribulation far too many times. Each time, he had to forcefully drag it out until the lightning tribulation dissipated. Otherwise, if he wanted to continue fighting the lightning tribulation ... The last time he had walked the path of life and death was the best proof. He had been directly shattered into pieces!"The power of destruction ... Is destruction the main force?"He fell into deep thought. Time was not mature yet and could not be used without restraint. What was truly mature was the chaos lightning tribulation.Should I use the power of destruction as the core of my sword Dao?'I'll reassemble the luminous moon sword with destruction as the primary power and lightning as the secondary power. My attacks will be like Primal Chaos tribulation lightning, and when my sword strikes, the Tribulation lightning will descend ... This might be my next main goal, a change in the Dao of the sword. 'Otherwise, his current sword Dao, which focused on life and death, five elements, and Nirvana recovery, had many means, but its killing power was ordinary. In his eyes, it was ordinary, which meant that he could not break through the physical body of a seventh rank venerable sovereign.Li Hao was a little disappointed.Before this, he had always felt that his thousand-Dao-swords were incredibly powerful. However, now he wanted to change that."Even rank eight venerable sovereigns can be restrained by chaos lightning tribulation ... Even rank eight venerable sovereigns are afraid of it.""This means that no one has found a way to restrain this destructive power!"Back in the Silvermoon world, li daoheng had intended to surpass the longevity sword and walk the chaos Destruction Sword. However, when he was killed by Li Hao, his chaos Destruction Sword hadn't reached major accomplishment.Even so, the other party had still managed to leave a wound of sword intent on Li Hao's River.Very strong!Li daoheng, on the other hand, was very talented, and his opponent was determined to surpass the venerable sword ... Although he was somewhat ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth, his opponent's thinking of destruction as his main priority was not necessarily wrong.The chaos lightning tribulation ... This was the punishment of the seven moons great Dao!"The power of destruction ... Or should I say, the power of calamity?"Li Hao mumbled. Was the chaos lightning tribulation a combination of the power of Thunder and destruction, or was it not the power of a single great Dao, but the power of a tribulation formed by many great DAOs?Yes, a calamity.​ This thing was specifically targeted at the power of the two extremes, the power of the five elements, the power of time, and any power that exceeded chaos 'expectations. It seemed to be targeted, which meant that this kind of power was truly powerful. Even before time matured, it would be controlled by it.If time was said to be the first and space the second, or was the power of this calamity the second?Or perhaps, these three ... Were actually difficult to distinguish between first and second? After all, even time itself was restrained by the primal Chaos tribulation lightning.Although it had something to do with Li Hao being too weak and time being too weak, time had always been invincible, yet it had been tortured and punished by the chaos lightning tribulation ..."The primal Chaos tribulation lightning might not just be a combination of destruction, lightning, and Primal Chaos energy. It might be a tribulation energy formed from many different great DAOs, just like time and space!"At this moment, Li Hao made some speculations, and he was generally sure that his speculations were true. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In a situation where time had not matured yet, he might be able to use this power of calamity as his main force.He wanted to create his own calamity sword Dao!Everything in the world had to go through a tribulation!This defeat didn't make Li Hao depressed. Instead, it encouraged him to work harder. He was instantly interested. 'That's right, I'm going to reorganize my Kendo. It can't be like this time. This time, it's clear that without time, even if he gathers thousands of DAOs and worlds, he's still not as good as emptiness.'The six godly fists were much stronger than his thousand sword strikes!Cultivation ... Still had to be compared.If he didn't compete, what Dao would he cultivate?He had spent as many resources as Kong Ji to reach level five, so why couldn't he compare?The void was able to pierce through the opponent's body, but I wasn't able to do so at the start. In terms of attack power, I was already slightly inferior.Being unwilling to admit defeat was also the motivation for cultivators to move forward."The power of tribulation ... The key should be the power of destruction! I'll first use the power of destruction to create a pseudo Primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... I'll study it again when the next lightning tribulation appears and perhaps create a true Primal Chaos lightning tribulation ..."Li Hao was no longer a newbie.His comprehension of Dao was still acceptable.At this moment, a realm quickly emerged. It was the world of destruction. In the small realm, a large amount of destructive power emerged. After several lightning strikes, Li Hao also captured some of the power of the lightning.At this moment, he silently sensed for a while and began to try to construct a sword principle with the power of destruction as the core.The sword was only a carrier.The key was the nature of the power.However, the firmament sword was only a fourth-rank Emperor weapon and could hardly bear Li Hao's power. The earth-slaying Dragon beast had almost been completely shattered, and even if it hadn 't, it was now broken.This made Li Hao feel a little helpless. It was very difficult to forge a stronger sovereign weapon ... Even a seventh-rank swordsman like venerable the sword didn't have a sword that could match him. With a seventh-rank sovereign weapon, venerable the sword's strength would probably increase by a lot.

Chapter 3248 Seventh-Tier Universe (3)
"However ... Although I've shattered the earthly Dragon beast, its bone armor is still extremely strong. Most of the bone armor is still intact, and its body is extremely strong ... It might not be a bad idea to reforge the firmament sword with the earthly Dragon beast's bone armor as the foundation!"As soon as he finished speaking, the firmament sword, which had fallen to the side, seemed to be a little excited.As an Emperor weapon that carried the current River of Dao, a level-four Emperor weapon was actually not bad. However, it was helpless to use it to kill a level-seven Beast of Chaos with its master like Li Hao.Li Hao did as he thought. He didn't know how to forge weapons, but it didn't matter. When it came to forging weapons, a true expert could forge a stage one material into a stage two or even a stage three Emperor weapon.This was the strength of the path of forging. New martial arts 'creation Supreme Emperor was one such example.On the other hand, the weak in the Dao of forging could forge a fifth-stage sovereign weapon with seventh-stage materials. This was also a Testament to their ability. Therefore, Li Hao was not afraid that he could not upgrade the firmament sword.As long as the materials are good enough, I'm pure iron, which is better than the knife made of tofu.Only the poor would consider using a stage one material to forge a stage two Emperor weapon while the rich would only consider using a stage seven material to forge a stage five or six Emperor weapon ...Li Hao comforted himself. What are you afraid of? I have the materials!'Even if I don't know how to forge one, the firmament sword can swallow some materials by itself and become stronger ... What's wrong with that?'With that thought, a bone banner filled with chaotic force appeared in his hand.These bone armor alone ... Were not necessarily inferior to the firmament sword. Li Hao smiled."The top-tier monarch weapons are often made of the materials themselves. For example, Dao chess is made from an eighth-tier great cosmos. We don't have any forging techniques ... But we can become the strongest ourselves! 'Firmament sword, you're the one I used to break the firmament. Now, you can't break the chaotic sky. You can't even kill a level Seven ... You're too useless!' If I devour these bones myself, I'll need to be at least a fifth-grade or even a sixth-grade Emperor weapon. Otherwise, I might as well use the bones to cut people, it might be more useful!"The firmament sword didn't waste any time. It disappeared instantly and went straight into a bone armor.That's right, if master doesn't know how to forge weapons, then ... As a weapon, I'll just forge my own.To make a weapon that could grow on its own!To avoid being abandoned.Li Hao laughed. That's good. Otherwise, it would be quite troublesome.He let the firmament sword strengthen itself. Li Hao studied the power of destruction and began to sort out his little world. He tried to weave it so that he could integrate the Dao of destruction into it and even make it mainstream. He might need to try this many times ... But it wasn't difficult for Li Hao.He wasn't stupid enough to always use small realms to reorganize. He only outlined some energy and then used the power of the great DAOs to arrange and reorganize. Although it might not be accurate, it could be used as a control test.Just like that, after a while of hard work, Li Hao finally managed to integrate the destruction Sword intent into it.Then, he began to move the Mirage on a large scale, arranging it according to his needs. This way, when he struck again, he could construct a simple Destruction Sword principle! ……In the Earth Dragon World, Li Hao had been delayed for three days.When he reappeared, the entire Earth Dragon Realm had been taken over. The few venerable sovereigns in the realm had been killed by others. The Queen was taking over the humans of the Earth Dragon Realm.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 The entire realm returned to silence.The nearby Tianhuang world had also been taken over. As for the Dao crystals, they were divided among everyone. This was only a small amount of money, and no one was interested in it.The two Dao Masters, including Black Panther, had been severely injured. They had recovered quite a bit in the past few days.Seeing Li Hao, everyone quickly gathered.Even Kong Ji, who had disappeared earlier and hadn't shown up when Li Hao didn 't, suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Many people gave him a few more glances. He was really good at hiding!"Have you all recovered?"After saying that, he suddenly looked at the Queen and raised his eyebrows slightly. 3rd rank!Damn, that was fast.He had not noticed it earlier because he had thought that the earthly Dragon beasts had not used up all their chaotic force. It turned out that this fellow had advanced again!The power of faith was a little terrifying, wasn't it?No, it was because of the chaos Dao.Even if the power of faith did not have a bottleneck, it would not be able to go from level one to level three in just a few days.Then, he looked at Lin Hongyu ... She was still a Tier 3 martial artist, but the deathly aura was too strong. He felt like he was losing his balance. He stopped talking and turned to Lin Hongyu. He frowned."Your life force is a little out of balance!"Life and death were out of balance, and the aura of death was too heavy!Lin Hongyu nodded calmly."I know that the dual polarity Dao is suitable for some geniuses. I ... Might be a genius in Silver Moon, but I'm not considered a genius in the path of a venerable sovereign. So ... I have some ideas. I want to ... Break the balance and focus on the Dao of death! It's easier to master one Dao, and to die with a single thought ... Life is easier than death, but death is actually very difficult ... I think that if one can reach the end of this Dao, he won't be too weak!"Li Hao was silent for a while."Then you won't be able to go through the cycle of life and death in the future ..."Lin Hongyu chuckled."The Dao of life and death and the Dao of reincarnation. It may not be a good thing to go through reincarnation once. After reincarnation, the essence and age are still the same, aren't they?"

Chapter 3249 Seventh-Tier Universe
Li Hao was startled. Why did she mention this again?He glanced at Lin Hongyu and suddenly turned his head to look at someone else. The Queen was extremely guilty and forced herself to remain calm. She cursed under her breath. Lin Hongyu, this old grandaunt, she actually ... Actually secretly complained!How shameless!Li Hao frowned slightly. After a long time, he nodded."The reincarnation cycle of life and death might not be suitable for everyone. Every time you walk it, your lifespan will be reduced. Since you want to walk the Dao of death, it's not impossible. The Dao of death has its own unique aspects that I don't understand, but seeing that you have some signs of the realm of death ... The Dao of death might be more suitable for you!"Lin Hongyu's Dao of death was a little unique. When she killed someone, the person would become her puppet. It even felt like she was building hell. Hell was perhaps a Dao domain.Dao domains were very difficult to attain. Although it wasn't considered so yet, and it was only the Dao of death, could one Dao form a domain?He did not know.However, this was indeed a kind of path. Could one be extremely powerful when one walked to the extreme?Li Hao wasn't sure. Most of the powerhouses he had seen didn't walk a single path. Only some of the seventh level venerable sovereigns in the eighth level great cosmos walked a path of supremacy."Since you're going to walk the Dao of death ...""You can try to kill some venerable sovereigns and see if they can become your death guards," Li Hao said after some consideration."If they can, you'll become a venerable sovereigns 'guard!"The level four venerable sovereign that he had killed last time had turned into a guard. He was still in Lin Hongyu's hell of death. However, he had been level four before, but recently, he had been very weak. Li Hao had also seen that he was probably only level two now.This also meant that it wouldn't last for too long.Lin Hongyu should consider how to preserve the strength of the deceased when he was alive, or even how to become stronger ... If he could kill a venerable sovereign and turn him into his own guard, and maintain his level, or even get stronger ... It would actually be very terrifying.Lin Hongyu nodded."I know. However, we've run into some problems. The biggest problem is that the consciousness of a dead venerable sovereign will gradually start to dissipate. Furthermore, my hell of death lacks a source of energy. It can't actively absorb energy to maintain the power of a venerable sovereign of death ..."His consciousness dissipated!Li Hao nodded slightly. This was a problem. When one's consciousness began to dissipate, the energy in one's body would also dissipate. There was no doubt about this. How could a corpse that could not maintain consciousness maintain its peak?Of course, a venerable sovereign's body was very strong. However, no matter how strong it was, after a period of time, a fourth stage venerable sovereign could only maintain the power of a first stage venerable sovereign, at most.Preserving consciousness ... This was actually very troublesome.If he kept all of them, and if he remembered what happened before he died ... Li Hao's heart suddenly moved. He said,""This isn't that difficult ... If we can make these corpses walk the path of life and death, wash away their memories, and turn them into living beings without past consciousness ... Special living beings, what do you think? You've also gone through the cycle of life and death. We're deliberately keeping our memories, but what do you think if we don't try to recover each other's memories?"Lin Hongyu was taken aback."Doesn't that mean that we have to resurrect him?" she asked."It's not resurrection. What I mean is that the life and death Star is dominated by the aura of death. Build a life and death Samsara wheel in your hell of death ... All the dead who go in have to be regrouped once ... Something like that. How you operate it depends on your own thoughts. When the time comes, it'll be like a piece of white paper. This way, you can even use their Dao to build your hell of death and see if it can be completely turned into a Dao domain ..."Li Hao spoke for a while, and everyone listened in silence. They were all moved.Using the Dao of the dead to build his own domain?The creation of the cycle of life and death ... No, the cycle of death!Lin Hongyu's eyes flickered, and Li Hao smiled again.""Your scimitar is quite interesting. It's similar to the so-called Grim Reaper's scythe in some legends. You ... Are quite interesting. Are you born to be a Grim Reaper?"Lin Hongyu was taken aback. Scimitar ... Reaper's Scythe?Soon, he smiled.""It seems ... True. Since you've said so, my saber will be the Reaper's Scythe from now on!"Death domain?He had constructed the reincarnation of death and used the Dao of the dead souls to construct his own domain ...Li Hao's words were not without reason. At this moment, everyone could understand Li Hao's genius even more. With a few simple words, he had almost laid the foundation for a level Seven venerable sovereign.The prerequisite was that Lin Hongyu could successfully construct it.This was a kind of Dao inheritance and communication.At this moment, Nan Quan squeezed his way out of the crowd. He had reached the peak of Tier 3 a long time ago, but he had not been able to reach Tier 4. Seeing that Li Hao had said something in a few words, which seemed to have helped Lin Hongyu find the right direction, he became anxious."Li Hao, what about me?"He had been calling Li Hao by his name most of the time, so he was getting anxious.I'm at the peak of Tier 3!Last time, with the help of the world source, he had directly stepped into it. However, the road to the fourth stage was extremely bumpy. He had also experienced several battles and absorbed countless Dao crystals, but ... It was still not enough.He was unable to step into the 4th tier!It was not just him. Up until now, apart from the two path Masters and black Panther, the world Lord, there had not been a single fourth rank venerable sovereign in the entire Silver Moon, including Yuan Shuo. However, Yuan Shuo only lacked the time to accumulate.
