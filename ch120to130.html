    Chapter 121: A kind person has good luck (2)
    ?
    
    In everyone’s opinion, after giving out the pennant, she would naturally leave.
    
    Who would stay? wait for the inspector to treat them to a meal?
    
    ……
    
    At the same time.
    
    Outside the inspection Office.
    
    An old man casually walked past the patrol office. After walking for a while, a black car stopped.
    
    Silver 7219.
    
    The old man glanced into the carriage as if he did not mean it.
    
    Soon, he left naturally.
    
    There was no one in the car!
    
    The car had been there for a few hours.
    
    After walking for a while, the old man entered a small alley. It was working hours, and there were not many people outside, so the small alley was very quiet.
    
    As the old man walked, he slowly said,””He’s not here. There’s no news after he went in.”
    
    A moment later, a cold man’s voice came from the headphones hidden under the White hair.””Come back first! Zhou He wouldn’t enter rashly. Furthermore, after he entered, he seemed to have disappeared ... There was no news from the inspection Office! It’s obvious that either they’ve escaped, or ... They’ve been secretly captured by the demon-hunting squad!”
    
    It was not the law enforcement team.
    
    Otherwise, some news would have been sent back.
    
    As for why Zhou He went in ... It was said that it was to give Li Hao a banner ... That was F * cking ridiculous!
    
    Did it have anything to do with Li Hao?
    
    Probably not!
    
    According to the information he had received, Li Hao even happily took the banner and returned to the secrets room to show it off.
    
    If a new patrol officer really wanted to link Zhou He’s arrest to him, he wouldn’t be so bold as to show off his pennant. Hence, when this happened, the other party immediately ruled out Li Hao.
    
    It was very likely that Liu Long and the others had discovered them and secretly captured Zhou He and the others.
    
    “Zhou He, that idiot!”
    
    The old man heard a curse again.
    
    He scolded Zhou He for being stupid!
    
    Are you bored?
    
    To deliver a banner to Li Hao ... Wasn’t that like sending a sheep into a Tiger’s Den?
    
    Did he really think that Liu Long and the others wouldn’t make a move?
    
    “Forget it, so be it ... Those two guys don’t know anything. It’s just a pity ... Zhou He that idiot. Originally, after this mission was completed, he would have been summoned back for the energy drawing ceremony. He had a high chance of becoming a superpower!”
    
    All the major supernatural organizations were actually quite concerned about a ten decapitation realm expert.
    
    The task given to Zhou He this time was not difficult. It was just for him to make a contribution. Only after he made a contribution would he have enough credit and reason to draw energy and become a super. There was a high chance that he could directly enter Dark Moon!
    
    Now, everything was in vain!
    
    He could only say that Zhou He was seeking his own death.
    
    The old man didn’t reply. He walked faster and faster, and his figure gradually disappeared into the alley.
    
    Since he was sure that Zhou He had been caught, he didn’t need to do anything else.
    
    ……
    
    At the inspection Office.
    
    Although Li Hao was about to be transferred away, he still completed his task seriously.
    
    In the afternoon, after he was done with his work, the phone on his desk rang.
    
    It was Liu Yan.
    
    He asked him to go to the law enforcement team.
    
    Li Hao said something to Chen NA and Wang Ming. Under Chen NA’s envious gaze and Wang Ming’s curious gaze, he left alone and headed for the law enforcement team.
    
    In the basement.
    
    The blood had already been cleaned up.
    
    He didn’t see Zhou He and that Yuan woman. He didn’t know if they were Dead or Alive.
    
    Li Hao didn’t care about this.
    
    Sometimes, Li Hao was actually quite indifferent to life and death. He was a loner, and his friends and parents had died. He had read countless case files, and there was no way that people didn’t die.
    
    After seeing so much and so much, her heart had become lighter.
    
    There was a small meeting room in the basement.
    
    At this moment, Liu Long and Liu Yan were both present. The others were nowhere to be seen.
    
    When Li Hao entered, Liu Long motioned for him to sit down.
    
    Li Hao obediently sat down.
    
    Liu Yan, who was beside him, still looked a little strange. She glanced at Li Hao and said with a strange look in her eyes,””Did you think of anything disgusting when you went back to work?”
    
    “……”
    
    Li Hao was confused. What disgusting thing?
    
    “Aren’t you afraid?”Liu Yan asked.
    
    “What?”
    
    Li Hao was really a little strange.
    
    Why?
    
    Didn’t they finish fighting?
    
    Why should I be afraid?
    
    When Liu Yan saw his expression, she felt a little tired and helpless. This guy was definitely a pervert.
    
    He actually went back to work as if nothing had happened!
    
    Who wouldn’t reminisce for a long time after their first actual combat!
    
    No matter if you win or lose, no matter if you kill someone or not, even if you don’t see blood, it’s worth reminiscing!
    
    But ... What about Li Hao?
    
    He really went back to work, and it seemed like the matter was over.
    
    “Little Haohao, you didn’t think about it at all?”
    
    Li Hao thought for a moment, then said,””I’ve thought about it, sister. I’m not heartless. When I went back, I was thinking that Zhou He was a Martial Master of the ten slashing realms. Did he have any martial arts secret books on him? Does it have any mysterious energy? Also, if a Martial Master is dead, can he be like a superhuman and extract some mysterious energy ... Even if there isn ‘t, the Martial Master has inner strength, can he extract it?”
    
    艹!
    
    At this moment, Liu Yan realized that this brat was really a pervert!
    
    She couldn’t help but curse in a low voice,”damn pervert!” What a cold-blooded fellow!”
    
    “……”
    
    Li Hao was innocent!
    
    What’s wrong?
    
    In his opinion, the demon hunting squad was the abnormal one.
    
    Wasn’t this something that any normal person would think about?
    
    Killing and arson were the most valuable things. Was there a problem with him asking if there were any benefits for him to take after killing a ten decapitation realm cultivator?
    
    Liu Long was also speechless. He interrupted the conversation between the two and said in a deep voice,”Alright! Let’s not talk about this! Tell me some information that I’ve just obtained. Li Hao, you’re the person involved, so you’re only here to listen!”

    Chapter 122: A kind person has good luck (3)
Li Hao obediently nodded.

“The Zhou He you killed ...”

Li Hao raised his hand like a student and quickly retorted,””I didn’t kill him!”

“……”

Liu Long said coldly,”you crushed his foot, pierced through his sternum, shattered his kidney, and shattered his spleen ... If it wasn’t for the fact that martial masters have stronger vitality, he would have died on the spot!” Even so, he couldn’t be saved in the later stage!”

Therefore, Zhou He was really dead.

Li Hao was a little dazed, but he quickly regained his composure and said nothing.

If he died, then he died.

In any case, he did not kill the man himself. The man had died during the interrogation. If he did not die in front of him, Li Hao would pretend that he did not know.

The first time he attacked, he killed a Martial Master in the tenth realm.

In fact, Li Hao was still a little concerned, but ... When he thought of the fact that the other party was a bad person, Li Hao felt at ease. As an inspector, punishing evil and promoting good, as well as killing criminals, were also encouraged by the inspector Bureau during their training!

If the criminal resisted and had the ability to harm him, the inspector also recommended that the criminal be shot directly!

Since that was the case ... There was nothing more to say.

Liu Long didn’t care what he thought and continued,”Zhou He, 40 years old, yaoguang city’s Martial Master!”

Yaoguang city was the second largest city in Silver Moon province, only second to Whitemoon city. It had a population of ten million and was ten times more prosperous than Silver City!

“He started practicing martial arts at the age of 21, and his teacher was a Martial Master in yaoguang city who was over 100 ... His teacher passed away ten years ago, and Zhou He entered the ten decapitation realm at the age of 32. For the next eight years, he made no progress!”

“A year ago, Zhou He joined a peripheral organization related to supers. This organization is called the ghost Face! The person in charge of grimace is a Martial Master with over 100 points, not a superhuman. Zhou He and Yuan Xiao are both members of this organization!”

An organization under supers?

Li Hao was deep in thought, while Liu Long said in a low voice,””There are many supers ‘organizations, but to let a Martial Master with over 100 points open a peripheral organization and recruit a group of martial masters, including many ten decapitation realms, this kind of supers’ organization ... Is definitely not weak!”

“You should know that there’s no such thing as an early morning without benefits! To a Martial Master, unless he advanced in rank, it would be difficult to bribe them. “It’s even more difficult to make them willing to risk their lives, and this organization provides a large amount of mysterious energy for these ten slash realm martial masters. If they can’t break through, they can become supers and break through 100 ... You have to know that even the night patrollers won’t use the mysterious energy recklessly!”

Li Hao frowned slightly,’boss, you mean this organization is rich? It might be a large scale and extremely powerful?”

“Yes!”

Liu Long nodded and glanced at Li Hao before continuing,””Also, it’s just a peripheral organization, but there are more than 100 martial masters ... In this era, there aren’t many martial masters over 100. Of course, there are more in yaoguang city, but a martial arts master over 100 is a rare martial arts powerhouse! It’s not easy to be willing to work for someone. ”

Li Hao nodded again.

Liu Long continued,”according to Zhou He, his and Yuan Xiao’s mission was to follow you and prevent you from leaving the Silver City. Their mission was simple and not a crucial role!”

Li Hao nodded again.

“There’s a problem with this, can you tell?”Liu Long suddenly asked.

What was the problem?

Li Hao thought and analyzed for a while. Then, he thought of something and said softly,””Boss said that this organization is very strong, so the people who came are very strong ... We’ve already guessed this, but it shouldn’t be the key ...”

Looking at Liu Long again, Li Hao seemed to have thought of something. His eyes flickered as he said,””The other party has a peripheral organization, which means that it is not just an organization of supers, and they do not look down on ordinary people! Moreover, if it’s in a local area, the hundred martial masters wouldn’t be too poor or have too low a status. Or, they would be like boss, the head of the inspection Office ... A firearm?”

He suddenly thought of this!

When Liu Long and the others fought in their own territory, they actually relied on the power of firearms to keep killing supers.

In that case, this organization might also have firearms?

“Not only that!” Liu Long nodded. The enemy’s Martial Master might have even been to the night patrolmen’s side. The hot weapons are one reason, and the second reason is that they might have all the information about our Demon Hunter squad! Therefore, we have no secrets to speak of in their eyes!”

Liu Yan continued,”thirdly, if there’s an organization in the field of ordinary people, their intelligence gathering ability will not be too bad. Your teacher, Yuan Shuo, might be one of their considerations! This includes the two night watchers from the Silver City. The two night watchers at the Dark Moon realm should be in their consideration!”

Liu Yan’s expression turned grave as well.”If that’s the case, given their cautiousness and the fact that they’ve been planning for more than ten years, they’ll have at least arranged for an attack that’s comparable to two Dark Moon elites with a cultivation base over 100!” She thought. Including us ... They’ve prepared at least five dark moons and powerhouses who have broken through the 100th level to deal with you!”

This was beyond their ability.

Liu Yan continued,”it would be better if it was a sun glory super. However, most of the people who came are moon darkness and those in the 100th rank. Even if they are strong in one-on-one combat, they can only do so much. We are worried that they will split up on the day of the attack! We’ll use a group of people to pin us down, and then deal with you alone!”

Li Hao didn’t say anything. This was indeed troublesome.

Liu Long glanced at Li Hao and said,””So, I have an idea ... The Li family’s sword is in your hands, and the other party might need your life and the sword! It’s best if we can split up ... If you’re at ease, leave that sword to me for safekeeping. That way, the other party won’t go all out against you, and even if we do split up, the pressure on your side will be much less. ”


Chapter 123: A kind person is lucky (4)
Yes, his main purpose was to hope that Li Hao would give him the sword.

In their eyes, Li Hao was just an ordinary person.

If the sword was with Li Hao, it would definitely suffer the most powerful attack. But if the sword was not with Li Hao, even if Li Hao was separated, he would only suffer a secondary attack.

However, it was a secret that Li Hao was already in the tenth realm.

If the other side underestimated Li Hao and only sent someone equivalent to the tenth realm to deal with Li Hao, they might give them a surprise!

However, the Li family’s sword ... Would Li Hao be at ease to hand it over to an outsider?

Liu Long began to think, because this would easily make Li Hao feel that he was coveting his family heirloom.

“Here you go!”

Just as he was thinking this, Li Hao took out his sword.

He placed it on the table!

Liu Long was slightly stunned and looked at Li Hao in surprise.

Li Hao smiled innocently,”who else can I trust if not boss?” Since I’ve joined the team, I’m one of them! I understand what the boss is thinking. It’s all for my safety. I should be grateful and not doubt anything! It’s just a sword. It might be a treasure, or it might be worthless ... But I can’t use it now. It’ll be a disaster if I keep it with me ... If boss takes it, he’ll be in even greater danger!”

As soon as he said this, Liu Long was a little touched!

Liu Long looked at the sword on the table and could vaguely feel the fluctuation of mysterious energy. From its appearance, he could tell that the sword was extraordinary. The fluctuation of mysterious energy also made him feel that it was not ordinary.

Li Hao had taken out such a sword just like that!

At this moment, Liu Long was even thinking whether it was appropriate to use Li Hao as bait.

I’m so sorry for this guy.

Of course, this thought was quickly suppressed. Li Hao had to be the bait. There was no other way.

“Li Hao ...”

At this moment, Liu Long didn’t say much. He only said in a solemn tone,””Don’t worry, as long as I’m alive, my sword will be there! In addition, once this mission is over, if we all die and you’re still alive ... Everything in the demon hunting squad will be yours!”

Good fellow!

Li Hao was secretly speechless. This is mine?

I’ve entered the core of the demon hunting squad in an instant?

How could old Liu be so emotional!

Li Hao felt that he was a rational person, but Liu Long was too emotional. He even said that he was still alive.

“Boss, we can win! Justice will prevail!”

Li Hao gave him some encouragement!

As for Liu Long, he didn’t say anything.

After thinking for a moment, he suddenly took out a Yellow Book from his pocket and casually threw it to Li Hao.””Take it back and read it. It might be useful. If it’s not, just read it in your spare time.”

After saying that, Liu Long took the small sword and left.

As soon as he left, Liu Yan suddenly snatched the yellowed booklet and looked at it with envy.””As expected, it’s the ninth-form force, which he’s best at. This guy is really ...”

Seeing that Li Hao didn’t quite understand, he explained,””This is the martial arts master’s Secret technique that boss is cultivating, the” nine-refinements force. “As the name implies, it is nine-fold force when it explodes! This was also the secret technique that boss’s father cultivated when he became famous. His father was a top martial Master in Silvermoon province!”

Li Hao knew!

A silver spear!

As one of the three Spears of the Silver Moon, even his teacher had said that it shouldn’t be weak. At the very least, it should be a top-notch existence with a score of over 100. Otherwise, his teacher wouldn’t have mentioned it.

It wasn’t a spear technique, but the “ninth-form force,” which surprised Li Hao.

Of course, what was even more surprising was that this thing ... Was given to me?

A Martial Master was actually much more strict about his own inheritance than superpowers.

Liu Yan continued,”take it and read it carefully ... This secret technique is very powerful. It’s not inferior to the ‘new book of five birds’ that your teacher inherited!” Your teacher’s Secret technique is very well-rounded, but it also has its flaws. It’s not explosive enough! “The nine-fold training is an extremely explosive technique. It’s nine-fold training of one force ... Of course, ordinary people can’t do it, and their physiques aren’t strong enough to support it!”

She sighed again and got up to leave.

.

Liu Long had actually left this behind, causing Liu Yan to feel a sense of danger, an extreme sense of danger.

Some martial masters were unwilling to pass down their martial arts even at death’s door.

Liu Long wasn’t willing to do so before, but now he suddenly passed it to Li Hao ... What did this mean?

This time, was there no return?

As for Li Hao, he suddenly felt a little heavy as he held the booklet. His heart felt heavy as well. You’re just going to pass this to me?

“The ninth refinement force ...”

It was a cultivation technique that specialized in explosive power!

Li Hao didn’t know how precious it was, but Liu Long’s special skill shouldn’t be too weak.

He thought for a moment, then suddenly picked up the communicator and dialed a number.

As Yuan Shuo’s last disciple, he could not rashly learn the heritage of other martial masters.

“Teacher!”

“Is there something?”

Yuan Shuo’s voice sounded a little tired, probably because he had just absorbed the saber energy.

“Teacher, have you heard of our captain’s ninth-form force?”

“Nonsense! The silver spear’s signature move, nine-fold spear! “It’s a pretty good secret technique. Although there are many drawbacks, it’s extremely explosive. In the past, when I exchanged ‘new book of five birds’ for it, that guy wasn’t willing to ... However, that guy died early and had something to do with this. One spear nine folds. His body couldn’t withstand it. At a young age, his arms were crippled and he died of depression! But if it were me, I’d be in good health and I’d be able to hit riyao so hard that he wouldn’t be able to recognize his mom!”

His teacher’s words seemed to be filled with disdain, but in reality, he was highly praising this secret technique.

Li Hao thought for a moment and said in a low voice,”well ... Captain passed it to me. Can I learn it?”

“What?”

Yuan Shuo was stunned. In the next moment, he suddenly shouted,””Nonsense, learn! You’re in such good health that this is the only thing that suits you. I was thinking about how to find a cultivation technique that is more suitable for you ... This is great! Liu Long and the others are old and sickly, you definitely won ‘t! Learn!”

“Why did he give it to you?” he asked in confusion.

It’s only been a few days!

Is Liu Long an idiot?

It was spread out just like that?

Also, was Li Hao really that good at fooling people?

I didn’t feel it!

“I don’t know,” Li Hao said in embarrassment.”I gave the small sword to the captain, and he passed this to me ...”

Alright!

Yuan Shuo knew the inside story. He knew that the sword wasn’t a good item. Whoever took it would be unlucky.

So, he had given away the thing that would cause trouble, and Liu Long was touched by it?

He was really ... F * cking speechless!

“Alright, you can read it yourself. I’m not suitable to read other Martial master’s Secret techniques, nor am I suitable to guide you, but this secret technique is indeed very suitable for you. If you learn it well, you can really do three layers at a time. Even if you just entered the tenth realm, you can even kill an ordinary middle-stage tenth realm expert!”

It was obvious that Yuan Shuo was really optimistic about it.

Moreover, this side effect, which was a backlash to the body, was not a big problem for Li Hao, because he had Starlight energy, which Yuan Shuo was also aware of.

……

He hung up the communication.

In the yuan family’s courtyard.

Yuan Shuo suddenly laughed, then cursed in a low voice,”F * ck! This little brat’s luck is so strong?”

He was really strong!

It felt like all the good things had come to his door!

“The ninth-form force!”

Silver spear ... You old man, you probably didn’t even know that your family’s Secret technique ended up in the hands of my student!

Chapter 124: Chapter 34_stacking force cultivation, darkness strikes
Night.

Qiming District.

At home.

Li Hao opened the “ninth-form force.” Beside him, Black Panther was sitting on the sofa and reading a book.

Li Hao didn’t push it away. He didn’t believe that a dog could understand human language, but it could also read?

If the Black Panther could recognize this, Li Hao could even call it master!

“A Martial master’s inner strength will burst out when they enter the tenth realm, and their bones and muscles will ring in unison ... The strength is limited and dispersed throughout the body. The difference in strength between martial masters of the same realm is very small ...”

This book was written by Liu Long’s father, not the original.

From the books, one could tell that Liu Long’s father, Liu Hao, was already an expert who had a cultivation base of over 100. He was a formidable Martial Master, and Yuan Shuo’s claim that Liu Hao treated him like his own grandson might be a little exaggerated.

A Martial Master at the peak of a hundred-plus years was almost as strong as Yuan Shuo.

Moreover, Liu Hao was the best at attacking.

The spear was the king of weapons!

Martial masters who used Spears mostly only attacked and never defended.

Liu Hao had made a name for himself in the martial arts world of Silver Moon province by using his ninth-refinement force and the nine-fold spear technique. He was known as silver spear Liu Hao and was one of the three great spear Kings of Silver Moon province.

In those days, there were actually many martial masters who had surpassed 100. Liu Hao had made such a big name for himself, so he was naturally not a mediocre person.

And the main reason was because of this “ninth-level force.”

With the same force, Liu Hao’s nine-fold spear attack was the best among the three great spear Kings in the past!

However, Liu Hao’s strengths were strong, but his weaknesses were also obvious. His speed was not good, and his physique was not good ... Nine-fold force was too harmful to the body. Liu Hao, who had entered middle-aged, had almost crippled both his arms.

This was also one of the reasons why Liu Hao took him to Yuan Shuo when he was young.

The Liu family’s spear technique was very famous, but Liu Hao knew that the ninth refinement was very harmful to the human body. An ordinary Martial Master with a cultivation of over 100 years old could still put up a fight at the age of 70. However, the Liu family’s members would decline rapidly after the age of 40, and they might even be completely crippled.

If Liu Long hadn’t absorbed the mysterious energy and strengthened his body, he would have been crippled at his age.

“Nine layers!”

Li Hao sighed with emotion. He didn’t know how precious this secret technique was, but he knew how powerful it would be after the nine-fold force.

The power of the ninth refinement force did not come from nowhere.

The main point was the use of strength. By gathering the strength of other parts of the body onto the arms, the layered strength would not only test one’s control of one’s own strength, but also the tenacity and strength of both arms.

“Is the third fold of the ten Realms his limit?”

According to the book, at the tenth realm, three layers of power was the limit. Otherwise, it was very easy to break both arms and leave behind irreparable old injuries.

If it was over 100, it was best not to exceed six stacks.

Liu Hao had encountered a strong enemy back then and used nine-fold skill. Although he killed the strong enemy, he was also injured at the root. His arms were almost completely crippled, and he left Wulin not long after. The silver spear of the three silver Moon Spears was sealed, and he passed away a few years later.

.

“The advantages of the ninth-form force are obvious, but so are its disadvantages ... Once the force is stacked, one can only stand still. Once one moves, the force will be dispersed ...”

This was the weakness!

It was also the biggest weakness of the nine refinements force!

You can’t move too much after extracting all the energy from your body. Otherwise, the energy will be dispersed and you might even hurt yourself.

Therefore, even though the ninth-form force was quite famous, some old martial masters also knew the severity of the problem.

“Unless one’s physique is strong enough to not care about the power being extracted ...”

This was probably the reason why Liu Long had passed it on to Li Hao.

This was because Li Hao’s physique seemed to be quite good. Even before he entered the ten slash realm, he had already displayed a powerful physique.

After the blood transfusion last time, his physique had been strengthened.

If Li Hao practiced the ninth-form force, it was very likely that he would be able to avoid the disadvantage of not being able to move. Even if he moved, Li Hao might still have the strength to continue maintaining the stacking force.

Also, the probability of him being injured would be greatly reduced.

Li Hao looked at it for a while. Apart from the expression and the way to use it, the key to the ninth-degree force was actually a special breathing technique.

That’s right, almost every secret skill would be matched with a special breathing technique.

For different secret Arts, the breathing technique was the core.

This was because different secret techniques had different ways of activating and exerting force.

If Li Hao used the breathing technique of five birds to practice the nine-refinements force, he would probably suffer from side injuries and hurt himself.

Therefore, the secret skill itself wasn’t too important, but the breathing technique that it was compatible with was definitely the most important.

This time, Liu Long even stuffed a breathing technique into it.

It was obviously a separate existence, just a piece of paper, stuck in the middle of the yellowed book.

……

Li Hao spent more than an hour studying the 3000 words one by one. Then, he began to practice.

First, he adjusted his breathing and used the breathing technique of the ninth-form force.

His breathing rhythm was completely different from before.

Beside him, Black Panther was staring at it without blinking.

Li Hao turned his head to look at it and smiled.

This dog, secretly learning again!

“You can only feel the rhythm of breathing, but you can’t feel the difference in your internal organs ... You can only follow the standard, not the textbook! However, you’re just a dog ... That’s enough. ”

The Black Panther did not mind and continued to learn from Li Hao.

His breathing gradually had a unique rhythm.

It wasn’t disordered, but the length of each breath was different. It didn’t make people feel uncomfortable, but it was a very rhythmic special rhythm.




Chapter 125: Chapter 34: stacking force cultivation, darkness strikes (2)
Since the Black Panther wanted to learn, Li Hao didn’t lower his voice.

Otherwise, if the breathing was weak, outsiders would not be able to detect anything.

After adjusting his breathing, Li Hao could already feel the force in his body.

It was different from the mysterious energy!

The inner strength was very special. It had a mysterious energy and felt like an external force. It was not the sense of isolation that the human body had.

Inner strength, on the other hand, truly felt like it came from the inside out and was a force produced by the human body.

This power came from his blood, muscles, cells, and bones. It was as if his entire body was producing this weak power. It was like life force. A healthy body would provide you with more powerful energy.

The inner strength was invisible, but it could be felt.

A stream of energy flowed through his body.

Li Hao gathered his strength on his arm. The muscles on his arm wriggled. Li Hao gently shook his hand, and the sound of slapping could be heard!

This was the sound of bones and tendons!

Compared to two days ago when he had just entered the ten slash realm, the current Li Hao seemed to have a better grasp and experience of his strength. With a shake of his arm, he pushed horizontally, directly pushing the Black Panther to the side five or six meters away, causing it to crash into the wall.

The Black Panther dog’s eyes were filled with innocence!

Of course, he wasn’t injured. The dog had absorbed some saber energy, and its body was much stronger than an ordinary person ‘s. It wasn’t weaker than any Martial Master of the tenth realm.

It was just that the dog didn’t know how to use its strength well because it was strong.

Li Hao didn’t care. He first experienced the feeling of his internal strength, and then quickly slapped the coffee table.

The coffee table was a marble table that his father had built from the mountains. However, many years had passed and there were already several cracks on it.

At this moment, Li Hao gently patted the heavy coffee table, but it didn’t have any reaction.

At this moment, Li Hao’s arm wriggled again, and a second force gushed out. He pressed his palm lightly on the coffee table, and the coffee table suddenly shook!

Clang clang clang!

The coffee table trembled, and it felt like it was about to crack.

Li Hao, on the other hand, was continuously adjusting his breathing. A third force was circulating in his body from other parts. The muscles in his right hand trembled and squirmed again, which was a bit scary.

This force, however, was somewhat unable to descend.

It kept wriggling on his right arm, causing Li Hao’s muscles to ache.

Li Hao, on the other hand, persisted in moving his force down!

This was the stacking force!

Of course, it was too slow now. The real nine-fold force could not be so slow. After one slap, it took a long time for the second force to come, and after a long time, the third force was still stuck in his upper arm. If he encountered an opponent who dawdled like this and did not have the time to use the third-fold force, he would have been killed.

It was Li Hao’s first time using it, so he wasn’t very familiar with it.

Under Li Hao’s persistence, the third wave of force finally moved down.

With a bang, a small crack appeared on the coffee table.

Li Hao was overjoyed.

Although the process was very difficult, it meant that he could learn it. Of course, at this moment, he was far from being able to call it the triple layered force. He had not even completed one layer!

The real triple layered force was three forces, one after another, with almost no gaps in between. That was the real overlapping force.

“The book says that this thing is the most difficult to start with because it’s too easy to hurt the body. Just now, I pulled the muscles of my right arm ...”

‘But ... Do I care?

Li Hao suddenly smiled.

The starry sky sword energy!

This thing was the most nourishing.

Even the mysterious energy’s violent impact could be neutralized, let alone inner strength. The impact of inner strength, especially on himself, was far inferior to the mysterious energy.

Therefore, the Starlight energy could definitely repair this small injury.

Other people might have just started practicing the “ninth-form force” and would only practice it once or twice a day, but Li Hao didn’t care. He circulated the “five birds breathing technique” and absorbed a bit of Starlight energy. The energy was transferred to Li Hao’s right arm, and in the blink of an eye, the muscle that he had strained earlier was healed.

There was no pain at all!

“Good stuff!”

This time, Li Hao once again felt the benefits of this energy. It was great.

In this way, he did not need any medicine to help him practice the “ninth-form force” at all. It should be known that the Liu family had an extra prescription for their practice. It was specially prepared to nourish the body in case the foundation was damaged during the practice.

The effect of Li Hao’s Starlight energy was many times stronger than the formula.

“It’s fun!”

Yes, Li Hao also found it fun.

Interest was the foundation of cultivation. If one had no interest in cultivation, then it would be difficult to achieve results in practicing martial arts.

Li Hao treated the ninth training force as a game, a fun game, and immediately became very interested in it.

He threw a punch, and the force began to stack.

In the beginning, the second force appeared at least three seconds apart ... In a real battle, it would be too late.

But gradually, as his arm got used to this force, the second force appeared faster and faster.

Two seconds, one second ...

However, it became difficult for Li Hao to improve after one second. The time gap was quite long. For martial masters, one second was enough for them to exchange several moves. Their opponents wouldn’t be so stupid as to be knocked down by one punch and not move for one second, waiting for a second attack.

“Pa pa pa!”

That night, Li Hao didn’t practice any other secret techniques. He focused on the ninth-form force.

This might be the easiest way for him to improve at the moment, and it was also the simplest.



Chapter 126: Chapter 34_stacking force cultivation, darkness strikes
?

With Starlight’s cooperation, he was not afraid of getting hurt.

He had no scruples!

The number of times he used his moves, the stacking of his forces, and the number of times he practiced in one night might exceed the number of times others practiced in a year or even five years.

If Liu Long were to see him practicing like this, his eyes would probably pop out!

An ordinary person’s arm would have exploded long ago.

Li Hao, on the other hand, was completely fine. Under the nourishment of the Starlight energy, the muscles in his arms had clearly become stronger. At a glance, it was obvious that he was full of strength.

……

Li Hao never got tired of it.

After throwing out punches and palm strikes again and again, he discovered a secret ... A secret that could not be considered a secret. After using the ninth-refinement force too much, he realized that the strength of his arms had become stronger.

In fact, this wasn’t a secret. It was just that normal martial masters wouldn’t do this. Whoever did this for a day would be crippled if not dead.

That night, Li Hao didn’t even have the mood to sleep.

At daybreak, Li Hao’s punch ... Rang out twice!

This time, there was almost no interval, and the two sounds seemed to turn into one.

Li Hao was startled ... He succeeded?

He couldn’t believe it. In the next moment, he punched the coffee table in his house again ... He had made quite a few holes in one night.

Pa!

This time, the coffee table cracked and fell to the ground.

Downstairs, the aunties who had just woken up suddenly roared,””Li Hao, what are you doing now?”

So early in the morning, what was he doing?

Li Hao was actually very careful!

He had even specially laid a blanket under the coffee table, but the punch just now had directly split the coffee table. Now, the blanket was useless.

Li Hao felt a little helpless. The place was too small. Not only was there no place to practice, even the slightest movement would cause the Auntie to cast Tiger Roaring Mountain forest at you ... The reason his Tiger Roaring Mountain forest had improved was probably because he had learned from the Auntie.

Li Hao had never seen a real wild tiger, but he had seen the Auntie downstairs’s lion roar countless times. She was extremely powerful when quarreling in the neighborhood. The other women in the neighborhood usually couldn’t beat the Auntie downstairs.

Li Hao comforted himself and quickly shouted,””The refrigerator is over!”

“Your refrigerator is always empty!”

The Auntie roared. She had poured it out so many times, yet she poured it out again. Your refrigerator is made of paper, how could it be poured out so easily?

“Change the refrigerator next month! I’ll give the refrigerator to you, Auntie. You can also sell it for junk!”

The moment she said that, the middle-aged woman fell silent.

Not bad!

If he earned a refrigerator for free, he could sell a few pieces of junk.

At this moment, Li Hao couldn’t care less about this. He had a bright smile on his face.

Success!

Second stacking force!

Although this was only the beginning and he was definitely not as good as Liu Long, he had managed to master the second fold in one night ... Li Hao fantasized that he might be able to master the ninth fold in a few days!

At that time, he might still be at the tenth realm. Maybe he could kill those in the 100th realm with a sudden burst of power.

“I’ve finally succeeded!”

The first successful attempt meant that the rest would be easier. Li Hao tried a few more times and succeeded every time. However, the third time, he returned to his previous state. It was very difficult and took a long time.

“It’s the 17th,”

Li Hao pulled open the curtains and looked outside. The weather had obviously changed today.

It was a hot summer day, but there was a cool breeze.

Dark clouds seemed to be gathering in the sky.

“It’s going to rain tomorrow,”

It had only been a few days since he had figured out that the red shadow was going to kill him next. However, in these few days, Li Hao felt like a century had passed.

He entered the tenth realm and joined the demon hunting squad. He found the way to use the energy of the Jade Sword and Stone knife, and learned the breathing technique of five birds and the ninth form force.

These were things that ordinary people might not be able to experience in their lifetime.

“He’s finally here!”

At this moment, Li Hao was actually hoping that the red shadow would arrive soon.

Even though he knew that he was weak, being forced to wait for death for a long time was still very stressful.

He gently touched the Jade sword on his chest.

Even now, Li Hao still didn’t know how to use this sword. It was too small. Was he expecting to kill with this sword?

What was the difference between this and stabbing someone with a toothpick?

“This sword has some effect on the red shadow. It has an abnormal reaction every time ... But ... I can’t kill the red shadow with the Jade sword between two fingers, can I?”

This was what Li Hao was most vexed about.

I’m not used to it!

Who was used to stabbing people with a toothpick?

The red shadow was the greatest threat to Li Hao, because no one could see it. If the red shadow got close and set Li Hao on fire, the others might not be able to save him in time. Li Hao had to deal with this problem himself ...

Then what should he do?

Li Hao took off the chain, picked up the cross-sized Jade sword, and stabbed it forward with two fingers!

It was so awkward!

“Forget it. If it’s awkward, then so be it. It might be of great use. Although it’s a little uncomfortable to use, it can still be used ... As long as it can be used.”

Li Hao once again put on the Jade sword and tried to quickly draw it ... He pulled out loneliness.

He pulled the chain, pinched it with two fingers, and jabbed it forward. That was it.

It was just that stacking force wasn’t very useful. Li Hao hadn’t learned to use stacking force on two fingers.

“To the red shadow, it might not matter if the energy is stacked or not, it’s the same.”

Li Hao stopped thinking about it.

This was also the limit of what he could do at the moment. What he should prepare, what he should ask for help, what methods he should use to help his teacher advance, he had used all of them. Compared to fighting alone before, this was a hundred times stronger!

Chapter 127: Chapter 34_stacking force cultivation, darkness strikes
?

If he still couldn’t handle this, then so be it.

Just as he was about to wash up, he heard a commotion in the house. Not far away, the Black Panther suddenly slammed its paw on the broken coffee table ...

The next moment, a shrill dog bark was heard.

“Aowu!”

Black Panther looked at his somewhat swollen paws and then at Li Hao in pain. What’s going on?

Why can’t I smash the coffee table?

Li Hao was speechless!

He absorbed a little of the sword energy, which circulated through his arm. The next moment, Li Hao pointed at the Black Panther, and the sword energy entered the Black Panther’s body.

The swollen dog paw seemed to feel much better.

The Black Panther still looked depressed. It looked at Li Hao as if it was asking for guidance. It had absorbed a lot of sword energy from Li Hao that night and was learning from him to practice the ninth refinement.

But it was useless.

“Humans and dogs have different paths. I really don’t know how to teach you. Gather the force in your arms ... Which is your dog legs. But how to gather it? I’m not a dog, so I can’t explain it to you.”

Li Hao said helplessly,”you think of a way yourself!” And ... Heibao, from tomorrow on, how about you follow me? Can you ... Deal with that thing?”

Hearing this, Black Panther was a little scared.

Li Hao thought for a moment and said,”you don’t have to follow me. Follow Liu Long. Last time, that big guy encountered that thing. I’m afraid he can’t see or sense it. Just shout in one direction a few times!” We’ll give him a heads up, give him directions, and let him know where that thing is ... What do you think?”

Heibao thought for a while and was still a bit scared.

Li Hao said,”it’s up to you. I won’t force you. But after tomorrow, I might die. You can continue to wander by yourself!”

Upon hearing this, Black Panther immediately became anxious.

He wanted to die?

Then what about me?

Woof! Woof! Woof!

“You agree?”

“Woof!”

Li Hao laughed!

This was good.

“I’m not forcing you to do this. You’re doing this willingly. I’m a very Democratic person. If you refuse, I won’t force you even if you’re a dog.

“Alright then, come with me to the inspection Office today and I’ll introduce you to the captain ... Behave yourself and don’t be too smart. Just act like a normal dog, but you can see that thing and bark when you see it. That’s the Black Dog’s ability. Anyway, the captain doesn’t know what the black Dog is capable of.”

The Black Panther’s eyes seemed to be filled with disdain. Li Hao patted its head, making the Black Panther a little dizzy. Only then did he suppress the dog, which was too intelligent.

……

At the inspection Office.

The law enforcement team.

In the basement.

When Liu Long saw black Panther, he was very suspicious.

Only when Li Hao said that the Black Panther could see that thing did Liu Long look at the Black Panther with great surprise.

Dogs can see?

“Are you sure dogs can see spiritual beings?”

These words were a little ambiguous.

It sounded like he was scolding himself!

Because he could also see it.

Li Hao remained calm and nodded.”Yes, I can see it. The few times I felt that something was wrong, the Black Panther would look in one direction and call out softly.”

Then, he added,”Black Panther can understand human language. It’s very smart. Boss, it might be easier for you to take it with you. Black Panther won’t cause you any trouble. Only when that thing appears will Black Panther remind you. And that thing won’t care too much about a dog.”

Liu Long nodded. Although he found it unbelievable, Li Hao’s words meant that this dog might really be different.

“Well, that’s good. I’ll bring it along later and get used to it. Don’t make any noise and alert the enemy.”

“I won ‘t, don’t worry.”

The two exchanged a few words before Liu Long asked,””Have you read the book? You’ll get a fever if you memorize it. Just remember it. I don’t expect you to learn it now. ”

Indeed, he had never counted on it!

The ‘nine refinements force’ was not easy to learn, especially at the beginning level. It was the most time-consuming.

When he learned this back then, it took him three years to get started. He only got better after that. After he got started, he was faster with three to four stacks.

His father, silver spear Liu Hao, was more talented than him. He had become a peak-stage Martial Master who had broken through 100 before the age of 40.

Even his father took a year to enter the sect.

Thus, even if Li Hao’s physique was better and he had the guidance of a famous teacher, Liu Long felt that it would take him at least a year or so to get started.

Li Hao was also bored to death.

He didn’t say that he had learned it and that it was unnecessary.

Good things should be hidden first.

If even the captain underestimated him, then the enemy would underestimate him even more. Only by keeping a low profile could one make a fortune and achieve great things. How could one achieve great things if they were all noisy?

After Liu Long said this, he continued, “Don’t go back tonight. Tomorrow morning, you and I will go to the suburbs. We are in the open, and they are in the dark. We have no choice but to take the initiative to lure the snake out of its hole!”

“Wang Ming asked me to climb Heavenly King Mountain!”

“I know,”

Liu Long nodded his head,”we’re not going to Mount Tianwang. However, the place we chose is right below Mount Tianwang. It’s not suitable for us to make a move there. Of course, if you feel that the night patrolmen can handle it, you can also follow us.”

He looked at Li Hao. Do you trust the night patrollers more or the demon-hunting squads more?

The night patrolmen might make a move.

However, it was hard to deal with a Night Watcher. Even if The Night Watcher was stronger, it might not be a good thing for Li Hao. Superpowers would not care about your life or death in a battle.

He, Liu Long, would at least keep an eye on Li Hao, and didn’t want him to die like this.

Li Hao smiled honestly.”Boss, you have the final say. But I think it’s better for us to join forces. Isn’t that better?”


Chapter 128: Chapter 34_stacking force cultivation, darkness strikes
Wasn’t it more appropriate to gather their strength?

The tactic of adding fuel to the fire was often the style of the villain. After one died, another would come, and then they would be killed one by one ... It was too unlucky!

Liu Long laughed and shook his head,”you’re wrong. We might not be stronger if we join forces!” Some supers had the ability to attack indiscriminately. In fact, most supers were like this, especially the offensive supers. With a Thunderbolt, everyone except themselves would be an enemy! If we act together, we might affect the other party, and the other party might also affect us. It’s not necessarily better to act together. ”

“What about our enemies?”

What if the other party also had many supers?

Would they affect each other?

“There’s such a possibility, so it’s very likely that the other party will split up. If they split up, the impact won’t be that big. Don’t worry, if something like this happens tomorrow, I’ll get Liu Yan to protect you!”

This was the strongest person in the team other than him.

Li Hao thought for a moment, nodded, and didn’t refuse.

No matter how confident he was, he didn’t think that he could deal with the red shadow alone. Besides, he didn’t have the confidence to do so either. Although he had killed a ten decapitation realm super, which was comparable to a Starlight realm super, Li Hao still felt that he was a weakling.

He had only fought once, and compared to his teacher, he was nothing.

His teacher was the amazing one. He had been sent flying and defeated two yunyuns with one move. Li Hao was nothing.

With Liu Yan around, if the situation allowed it, he would just add salt to the wound.

The two discussed for a while, and soon, Liu Long left with Black Panther. According to his words, he would first be intimate with Black Panther, in case he didn’t cooperate.

……

Originally, Liu Long bringing Heibao away wasn’t a big deal.

However ...

Half a day later, Liu Long found Li Hao with a strange look in his eyes. Without saying a word, he suddenly punched Li Hao and then inexplicably ran away.

Li Hao couldn’t figure out what was going on.

Why did you punch me?

……

The law enforcement team.

In the captain’s office.

Liu Long’s gaze was extremely strange. He stared at the Black Panther for a long time before sighing,”A man is inferior to a dog!艹! You dog, you actually know a breathing technique, and it’s the Liu family’s nine-refinements force breathing technique! Aren’t you too F * cking smart? it took me a few days to learn it, but you watched Li Hao train last night and learned it. You know it too?”

Yes, he had discovered it.

This was because Heibao had used his breathing technique out of habit. Even though Heibao’s breathing was very low and normal people wouldn’t be able to tell, this was the breathing technique of the Liu family.

Liu Long didn’t notice it at first, but after a while, he realized that the dog’s breathing rhythm was the same as his ... He was almost dumbfounded!

One man and one dog, Liu Long took a breath, Black Panther took a breath, Liu Long paused for a while, Black Panther paused for a while ...

It almost killed Liu Long.

This dog was very strange. No wonder Li Hao said that he could see spiritual beings.

“The appearance of superpowers, even dogs have become spirits!”

Liu Long shook his head and was not too surprised. He sighed and said,”With the revival of myths and superpowers, it’s said that there are animals in Whitemoon city that have become spirits! In the central region, there was even news that an animal that had turned into a spirit had devoured a top powerhouse who had surpassed the radiant sun realm! I didn’t expect that the small silver City would have a dog like you. ”

Thinking of this, he laughed at himself,”even a dog can become a spirit, but I can’t become a super. How ironic!” Forget it, forget it ... You’ve learned my family’s breathing technique. Since I’m idle, I’ll teach you the ninth refinement force and try it out. When you really become a spirit in the future, give me nine folds with one claw! Let’s kill those bastards!”

He laughed as he said that.

Can a dog learn it?

Who cares, I’ll try.

He was much stronger than Li Hao. He had been learning the ninth refinement force for decades, and Li Hao was no match for him. After studying the Black Panther for a while, he began to teach it the nine-fold dog paw technique under the Black Panther’s excited gaze!

As for Black Panther’s learning ability ... Liu Long’s jaw almost dropped.

F * ck, even he couldn’t learn as fast as Black Panther.

In fact, this was also because Black Panther had practiced the whole night and absorbed a large amount of Starlight energy. If he really met a suitable teacher, he would naturally learn quickly.

The dog’s paw almost formed an illusion in the air!

Two-fold dog paw!

When Black Panther’s dog paws folded twice, Liu Long almost wanted to say,”you can be my F * cking student. Just be my last disciple. This is much better than being human.”

Yuan Shuo had taken in Li Hao, and he felt that Li Hao was very talented.

But looking at it now, bullsh * t, how could Li Hao be as smart as Black Panther?

In a short while, he would be able to do the second-fold dog paw!

On this day, even though a major event was about to happen, Liu Long didn’t do anything proper and instead stayed in the office to teach the dog. If this news were to spread, the members of the demon hunting squad would probably go crazy.

They thought that Liu Long was locked up in the office, thinking of ways to deal with the enemy and the crisis that might come tomorrow.

However, no one would have thought that he would teach a dog martial arts one day.

At the end of the practice, Black Panther could even use three-fold dog paw strikes with difficulty.

Li Hao’s jaw would probably drop if he knew!

Time slowly passed by as Black Panther continued to train. July 17th gradually came to an end.

The sky was dark and the clouds were dense.

Silver City, a cool breeze blew.

In the darkness, bloody shadows appeared one after another, waiting for the upcoming harvest.

The eight meridians would converge soon!

Chapter 129: It’s raining (1)
Tap tap tap tap ...

It was raining!

The small raindrops in the capillary vessels dripped down, one by one. The sunshade on the window collided with the rain, making a dripping sound.

The night was quiet.

In a small city like silver City, there were very few pedestrians on the road after 10 O’ clock in the evening.

Knowing that the weather wasn’t good and that it was about to rain, there were very few people outside the Silver City.

On the street, the merchants on both sides had already closed their doors.

The rainy season was here!

It would rain all over Silver City.

……

In the basement.

Li Hao had changed into a new inspector uniform, with the vortex Mk III at his waist and a few grenades in his pocket.

It would be too inconvenient if he didn’t carry a powerful hot weapon. It was very difficult to operate it alone, and it was also inconvenient to carry it around.

Not far away, Chen Jian had a shield next to him. It was a Black Shield, not too big, and was mainly used to protect vital points.

In the corner, the doctor, Yun Yao, was packing her small medicine box.

As for The Thin Man, Wu Chao, he was playing with the dagger in his hand. He seemed to be in a daze, thinking about something.

Liu Yan was in front of Li Hao.

At this moment, Liu Yan wasn’t smiling, and she was also in a daze. In front of her was a photo frame that had been taken down. She didn’t know who was in the photo frame. Could it be her murdered husband?

Bang! Bang!

The door opened.

Liu Long, who was wearing a windbreaker, was followed by a dog. Only then did he come out of his office with Heibao.

Everyone’s eyes turned to him.

Even Liu Yan and Wu Chao, who had been distracted, were no longer in a daze. They pulled themselves together and looked at their Captain.

This person was the spiritual pillar of the demon hunting squad.

“It’s raining!”

Liu Long strode in, his tone cold as he looked around,”is everything ready?”

“I’m ready!”

Chen Jian responded in a muffled tone.

Liu Long revealed a cold smile,”remember, evil will never defeat justice! We belong to justice!”

“Justice!”

Everyone shouted!

“For the sake of justice, exterminate the evil and protect the Dao!”

The team’s slogan rang out in the basement again. It was such a Chuunibyou sound, but the reverberating voice agitated Li Hao’s heart.

To act in the name of justice, to exterminate evil and defend the Dao!

BOOM!

At this moment, a thunderous sound rang out.

However, the expressions of Liu Long and the others changed slightly.

Liu Yan quickly stood up and her face turned cold.”It’s not Thunder!”

Yes, it was not Thunder.

They were all too familiar with it!

This was a bomb!

Liu Long’s face turned slightly ugly as he stiffly smiled, “Super...You’re really capable! They don’t want us to leave the city. They don’t want us to take the initiative. They ... Have entered the city!”

They had entered the city!

The enemy had entered the Silver City and was destroying it. They even used the safety of the city to force these people to separate and control them.

Li Hao’s face was slightly pale.

Liu Long and the others thought that he was scared, so they didn’t say anything. They were just surprised that Li Hao was actually scared now. As expected, young people were useless at critical moments!

Li Hao, on the other hand, was not frightened.

He only listened to the sound and was a little angry and frightened.”Boss, is that the sound of a bomb? It seems ... To be coming from the direction of my house ...”

It felt like it!

As for whether it was true or not, he couldn’t be sure.

Outside, there was a clamor.

The inspection Office was dispatched!

At this moment, Liu Long had regained his calm,”it’s just the beginning. It seems that the opponent this time is not easy to deal with!”

Before Li Hao’s group could leave the city, the other party took the initiative to attack.

It was a deterrence and also a warning.

Don’t even think about leaving the city!

He was even telling Liu Long and the others to give up. We know all about your arrangements.

They even knew where Liu Long had set up the trap, waiting for them to step into it.

Don’t think about it!

Some supers were very arrogant, but some were very cautious. The opponents this time were all very cautious. Even if they didn’t think that the demon hunting squad was scary, they didn’t want to step into the trap set by Liu Long and the others.

Liu Long took a deep breath. At this moment, he knew that he might be in trouble.

“Clang clang clang!”

As the bell rang, Liu Long picked up the communicator beside him and a familiar roar came from it,””Liu Long! Where are you? As for the law enforcement team, you’re not here, and Liu Yan isn’t here. Something big has happened in the Silver City. Are you deaf? There’s been an explosion, and someone died!”

The law enforcement team needed to solve such a big matter immediately.

However, the law enforcement team was in a bit of a mess because the captain and vice-captain were not around.

The explosion case was only one place.

He didn’t know if there was another one.

Not only that, an angry voice sounded in the communication channel again,””Go back to the inspection Office immediately and bring a team to the crime scene! Not just you, Liu Yan, return to the team immediately! There’s been an arson in the western suburbs of Silver City. It’s an oil depot that was set on fire ... Someone set the place on fire!”

Liu Long’s expression was calm as he slowly said: “alright, chief. Don’t worry, I will handle it!”

“Liu Long!”

The Secretary’s voice rang out again, with a heavy tone,””I know you’ve been busy recently, so I’ll turn a blind eye to some things! However, professional matters should be solved by professional people. I’m the Secretary of the inspection Division, and the inspection Division is the only law enforcement agency in the Silver City ... You have to understand that the safety of the entire city’s people is more important than one person! Tonight, I’ll be in charge of the inspection Division. You ... Need to go out and arrest the criminals. That little guy ... If you think you must keep him, send him to the Office of the Director of the inspection Division!”

The two of them understood that the explosion was just the beginning, a warning.

It was also to let the inspector know his place and to let Liu Long’s demon hunting squad give up on protecting Li Hao.

Their target had always been Li Hao.

 

Chapter 130: It’s raining (2)
Therefore, at this moment, whether it was the explosion case or the arson case, they were all a warning, not a complete fall out with the Silver City’s law enforcement agencies.

The Secretary’s voice was very loud.

Li Hao also heard it.

This time, Li Hao also understood how terrifying and cunning the enemy was.

They didn’t care about the participation of the demon-hunting squads, because they already had a plan ... To make the Silver City fall into chaos!

As long as it became chaotic, the demon hunting squad would be under enormous pressure.

Didn’t you claim to be righteous?

So now, are you going to solve other cases and maintain peace in the silver Blizzard city, or are you going to stay and protect Li Hao?

“I know!”

Liu Long’s voice remained calm,”I will handle it!” Secretary, I’m hanging up!”

He hung up the communication.

Liu Long glanced at Li Hao and was silent for a moment. Then he said,””You guys wait here and don’t move. I’ll go up and deal with it!”

“Boss!”

“This is what they want to see!” Liu Yan’s expression changed slightly.

He let the demon hunting squad leave, too busy to take care of themselves.

From the beginning to the end, those people’s target had been Li Hao. This was very clear.

“I know!” Liu Long nodded.

However, he had to go out.

If he didn’t go out and didn’t show himself, those people would continue to create all kinds of disasters and protect the Silver City. Sometimes, it wasn’t just empty talk.

Liu Long still left.

At this moment, Li Hao’s expression turned ugly. It wasn’t because of Liu Long’s departure, but because he was angry. He was angry at those people who wanted to kill him. They were really unscrupulous and unscrupulous in their actions!

They were using the lives of the entire city to force the demon hunting squad to not interfere.

Even if they felt that the demon hunting squad wasn’t scary and could be dealt with, they still chose to use the Silver City as a threat just in case.

“He should be killed!”

Li Hao roared in his heart, but he was helpless. He was too weak.

……

That night, Silver City was a little chaotic.

It was still raining.

However, Silver City was on fire in many places.

It was only when Liu Long appeared and led a team to patrol the surroundings that the chaos in the Silver City gradually subsided.

……

Silver City ancient Academy.

The yuan family.

At this moment, Yuan Shuo was not the only one present. Two other night patrollers, Hu Hao and Li Meng, were also present. Li Meng’s injuries seemed to have recovered a lot, but his face was still a little pale.

Hu Hao looked outside and felt the chaos outside. He said softly,””Elder Yuan, we’ve reported this to the Nightwalker headquarters, and reinforcements will arrive soon ... But for now, it’s best if you don’t go out. It’s safer for you to wait here!”

Hu Hao vaguely understood that the other party didn’t want to make an enemy out of the night patrolman. It wasn’t to deal with Yuan Shuo either, but to deal with Yuan Shuo’s students.

From the perspective of the night patrolmen, these people were extremely audacious ... They should be killed!

However, their mission was to protect Yuan Shuo. Therefore, Yuan Shuo was more important than Li Hao. They couldn’t put Yuan Shuo in danger for Li Hao.

Yuan Shuo didn’t say anything and just looked outside.

Outside, it gradually became quiet.

“You’re so bold!”

Yuan Shuo suddenly opened his mouth and coldly said,””Superpowers are superpowers, mortals are mortals, but there are still laws in this world! This organization is too Savage. Do you know which organization it is?”

He was too Savage!

The Silver City was small and remote, but it was still an official city. Now, it was being used as a tool to threaten the night patrollers and the inspection Office.

“I’m not in charge of this, so I don’t know much. ” However, to act so unscrupulously and hard to track ... They must be from the three major superpower organizations, Red Moon, flying heavens, and Yama!”

Yuan Shuo frowned when he heard the names of the three great organizations.

Is it one of the three organizations?

If that was the case ... His student’s trouble would be greater than he had imagined.

These three organizations appeared even earlier than the night patrollers.

The night patrollers were established 20 years ago, but the three major organizations might have been established even earlier, just that they had never appeared. It was only until the night patrollers were established that the officials obtained some clues and knew of the existence of the three major organizations.

Compared to the other superpower organizations, Red Moon, flying heavens, and Yama were further in the field of superpower and had more powerhouses. With a quick glance, they could also discover many frightening secrets.

His strength was beyond imagination.

Yuan Shuo did not say anything else.

If it was one of the three great organizations ... They would be in big trouble this time. However, the other party had come to the Silver City only to deal with Li Hao. Even if they sent a powerhouse, it wouldn’t be too big of a deal.

Otherwise, if they were really set up by the night patrolmen and lost some of their top powerhouses, that was not an outcome the three major organizations wanted to see.

Yuan Shuo did not move.

He was waiting.

Now was not the time for him to make a move. If he were to make a move ... Since it was his first time making a move, he naturally had to achieve something. Otherwise, if he did not kill the snake, it would be even more difficult to deal with in the future.

In the room.

The two night patrollers also had unsightly expressions.

The night patrollers were a legitimate superpower organization. However, at this moment, they felt a little sullen. They were not strong and this mission was not something they could take on. They could only watch as the night patrollers lost their dignity!

Although Silver City was small, it was still a city with a population of a million.

Today, however, he was enveloped in the deterrence of others.

“We’ll annihilate them sooner or later!”

Li Meng snorted coldly!

A newborn calf is not afraid of a Tiger. Her tone is very big, and her courage does not seem small.

Yuan Shuo didn’t say anything. Hu Hao sighed in his heart. His thinking was simple. If it could be destroyed, the night patrolmen would have made their move long ago, but they couldn’t do it. Moreover, the other party’s whereabouts were secretive, which led to today’s result.
