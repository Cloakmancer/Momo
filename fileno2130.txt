Everything was because of this group of bastards.The death of Yuan Shuo and the others was also because of this fellow.If Zheng Yu had not been seeking a second recovery, if he had not organized the invasion of the four countries, if he had not wanted to massacre the world and recover in advance ... Why would Li Hao's side have forcefully attacked boundless city at that time?He didn't hate anyone ... But Zheng Yu and his group of people were second only to Ying Hongyue. They had even caught up to Ying Hongyue, causing him to feel boundless disgust! He didn't hate red Moon sovereign.They were enemies, and they were here to invade. It was a matter of position, so they could just kill them. Why should they hate them?However, Li Hao hated and detested Zheng Yu!If you can't sense it, I'll think that I've killed you for nothing. You should be the one to sense it.Li Hao chuckled."Not only will he sense it, but I'll also let him see that we've devoured his father's flesh, blood, bones, and power ... I'll let him know that I killed his father and his second brother!" And the next one ... Is him!"Li Hao said it nonchalantly, but the ninth Division commander's expression changed slightly.""Cultivating the Dao and the heart ..."  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  "I'm at peace. "Li Hao said calmly,"there's no need to say anything, ninth master. I know what I'm doing. In the past, someone advised me not to become a killing machine because of hatred. In fact, I've long realized that I won't fall into a slaughter. But I need to kill, I need revenge, I need peace! I'm not a saint or a devil, I'm a Martial Master of the pugilistic world. A life for a life. If I have the ability, I'll take revenge. If I don 't, I'll give up. It's that simple! When one is in the pugilistic world, one should be indifferent to life and death. When has one ever fallen into the demonic path?"There was no need to admonish him.He knew and was very clear about what he was doing. He would not lose control. He was very clear and understood everything that he had done.However, his words made the ninth Division commander's expression change slightly.At this moment, Li Hao ... Was extremely calm. The more calm he was, the more terrifying he was.After Yuan Shuo and the others died, Li Hao changed.What had he become?With a clear mind and no worries, Li Hao finally felt that the great Dao was emotionless. I'm just a cultivator. Nothing in the world is worth mentioning except for revenge.Li Hao, on the other hand, had already disappeared. His voice resounded,""I'm trying to conjure the Heavenly King's Dao. Everyone, please help me cut off my Dao! Shanqi and the Imperial Guard have done well in stopping the enemy this time. If you're not a Saint, you can absorb the essence. If Shanqi can enter the divine Dao ... It will also add a Saint to the monster plant family!"In the distance, the Redwood tree was ecstatic!Cutting off a Heavenly King's Dao would inevitably result in a large amount of origin power overflowing. Even if it was not as good as it was in the past, even if it was almost exhausted by Zheng Hongyuan, a Heavenly King was a Heavenly King. It was just an undying.Sure enough, he had made the right bet.The opportunity had come.If it could enter the sage level this time and change its Dao, it might be able to enter the Dao integration level very soon.It quickly appeared on the original battlefield. As for Li Hao, after exploring and thinking for a while, the power of the great DAOs in the surroundings gathered and seemed to sweep through the void. The Heavenly King's Dao had not been completely broken, and he was not sure if it was still here.He would investigate first.After searching for a while and finding nothing, Li Hao frowned. Could it be that they were not here?Disappeared?He didn't know much about the great Dao of origins. For example, if a new Dao cultivator died and his Dao Meridian didn't shatter, would his Dao Meridian still remain in place?Who knows?It might be, and it might cut off his connection with the bright star sector. Even now, Li Hao couldn't be sure."Perhaps ... He's been rejected ... Outside the bright star sector, in the direction of the star suppression city ruins ..."Li Hao's heart stirred. Perhaps the other party had been expelled the moment he died. When he killed Wu Peng, the other party had just died, but his Dao remained in the same place.At the thought of this, he instantly used his body as a passageway, opened it, and disappeared from the spot. The others followed him out.At this moment, the chaos in the great wilderness was receding.However, it did not completely disappear. Although it had faded a little, it still remained in the same place, but it was much thinner.Above the ruins of Star Town City, Li Hao and the others appeared one after another.Li Hao scanned the world and sensed silently. Suddenly, his eyes flickered and he smiled.The next moment, he waved his hand, and the power of the great path spread in all directions. Gradually, an extremely thick great path that led to the sky seemed to appear in front of him. It spread into the boundless darkness, and perhaps at the end was the universe of origin.However, this origin universe ... Had cut off their connection at this moment. Even if they walked to the end, they would only see endless void and darkness. They would no longer be able to return to the origin universe.Everyone took a deep breath when they saw the path.The old turtle said in a deep voice,"it's just that the universe of origin has disappeared. Otherwise, with the strength of this guy's great Dao, he could have entered the late Heavenly King stage ..."Unfortunately, he no longer had the amplification of his Origin Energy.Otherwise, his combat strength would be even more terrifying.At this moment, a person seemed to appear on the looming great Dao. The figure was somewhat illusory. It was Zheng Hongyuan. Zheng Hongyuan was dead, but it was only a death in the conventional sense.The great Dao was still there ... If one could connect to the universe of origin, or if someone was willing to pay a large amount of origin power, the great Dao would still be there, and this person could still be resurrected.Only the world Lord could be resurrected.In other words, after cutting off his Dao, if the other party wanted to resurrect him, only the new Martial Emperor and Emperor Cang could resurrect him. But ... How was this possible?

Chapter 2131 Face-To-Face Revenge (3)
Li Hao laughed!At this moment, the shadow on the path was defenseless. It seemed to have woken up and saw Li Hao's group. A voice came from the dark."My physical body and spirit have both fallen ... Are you going to kill me?"The appearance of the great Dao and the recovery of the mark was not a good thing.Although he had regained his consciousness for a moment, it meant that the other party had no intention of letting him go.Li Hao didn't say anything. At this moment, a small sword appeared in his hand as he walked into the void. At this moment, his voice was calm."I have promised some people that neo martial artists, not traitors, even if they go against me, I will try to keep my Dao, and this ... Does not include you!""Li Hao ... You're releasing the demonic nature of an Emperor-to-be! You've cut off my Dao, my son will never ...""So childish and laughable."Li Hao chuckled,'Zheng Yu? I'm ... Waiting for him! It's a pity that I haven't met him yet. I hope that I'll be able to see him today. "As soon as he finished speaking, he slashed down with his sword!BOOM!The heavens shook as a huge sword pierced through the heavens and earth. A blood-curdling scream reverberated in all directions.At this moment, some of the neo martial artists could sense something.……Hurricane city.Suddenly, red dust's eyes opened. The next moment, Hurricane city disappeared.……Martial Union.The second elder suddenly opened his eyes. The seventh elder's expression also changed slightly. He looked into the distance and into the sky. Outside, the slightly awakened Guardian monster plant also muttered,""The great Dao is shaking. There are experts whose great Dao is shaking ... What's happening?"The last time he had such a feeling was when there was some turmoil in boundless city. Of course, at that time, Li Hao had only killed a Saint and cut off the great Dao of a Saint, so his perception was not as clear as it was now.When Zheng Hongyuan died, they didn't actually feel much. They only felt the world shake. But now, as the origin of the great Dao was being cut off, they all felt it.At this moment, a voice suddenly travelled over from the outside. A man walked into martial Union with a sky screen treasure mirror in his hand. Floating in the air, his voice resounded throughout the entire city,"Under the orders of the Marchioness of Silvermoon, I present a sky screen!""Whether it's right or wrong, it's all in the sky! The Zheng family has rebelled, and the Marquis has killed the head of the Zheng family, Zheng Hongyuan, cutting off his great path. Zheng Yu has changed his name to the mortal world, and may come ... May not. Everyone ... Take care of yourself!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.At this moment, Li Hao's appearance suddenly appeared in the sky. One sword, two swords, three swords ...The entire city looked up.In the void, an extremely thick great path appeared in front of everyone. At this moment, an illusionary figure struggled madly but was powerless. Sword after sword, a part of the great path was cut off."Master Zheng ..."The elders 'expressions changed drastically!This great Dao ... Heavenly King!Sure enough, that person had entered the Heavenly King level, but ... How did a Heavenly King end up like this? Some people couldn't believe it!Someone said angrily,"Li Hao, this ... This is ... Does he have evidence?" He dared to kill the innocent. He dared to kill my neo martial Heavenly King ... It's not his turn to kill the Zheng family's master ..."However, no one responded.Everyone looked on in a daze.At this moment, they were all a little dazed.How could that be?This was a Heavenly King!Screams seemed to be coming continuously, and the great Dao was shaking continuously. Some of them were completely broken, but there were still signs of it not being broken. Everyone was stunned.At this moment, not only martial Union, but the Zhang family's dingtian city was also broadcasting this scene.……In the sky above the ruins of Star Town City.The sword slashed down one after another, and the great Dao kept collapsing, but it still existed. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  At this moment, the void trembled. In an instant, an incomparably huge city appeared in the void. The next moment, a figure appeared above the city.He was very young.It was very cold!Red dust's clone appeared. He looked at Li Hao, who was standing between heaven and earth, and said calmly,""Li Hao, state your conditions!"He knew that Li Hao hadn't cut off his path because he was waiting for him.,m Since that was the case ... He was here.His second brother, Zheng Gong, had died very quickly, and the great Dao had been severed very quickly. He didn't have the time to rescue him, and with Zhang an's obstruction, Zheng Gong had completely fallen. Now, he saw his father's great Dao crumbling.As long as he didn't stop ... He could still be saved.When the Stargate was opened, or when he became a venerable sovereign, he could save him.Once the great Dao was completely severed ... Could they expect the human King to save them?What a joke!Li Hao stood in the air and looked at the man. This was the first time he saw Zheng Yu and Hurricane city. He smiled."There are so many people in the world. You do your thing and I do mine. Why must you kill me? Even red Moon sovereign is still alive. What can you do even if you kill me?"Hong Chen stood on the city wall with his hands behind his back. He looked at him and said,""You're a variable in the new era. If you were me, you'd do the same. Just state your conditions!"Li Hao smiled brightly,"what can you give me?" 'You're a prisoner, a prisoner who doesn't even dare to walk out. Tell me, what can you give me?' Energy stones? A divine weapon? Or something else? I want you to kill yourself in exchange for your father's Dao. Are you willing to do that?""I don't want to."Red dust replied calmly,"I only know how to take revenge!"He then added,"there's a lot more that I can give you. Energy stones, spring of life, divine weapons, martial arts techniques, combat techniques, including Origin Energy and immortal energy. I can give you whatever you want. He's already dead and is no longer a threat ..."

Li Hao smiled."Do you know why I waited for you to come here?"Red dust frowned and looked at Li Hao.""Do you really have to do this?""Yes!"Li Hao nodded and smiled,"I want you to witness everything with your own eyes, just like me!" Of course, you might not care. It's good that you care, but it's also good that you don't care. It's fine as long as I'm in a good mood. ""You will pay the price for this." n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Red dust only looked at him, and his tone remained calm.""You killed him because you're capable. You cut off his Dao in front of me. That's a malicious provocation. You'll have to pay a heavier price than before!""Li Hao ... If you do this, people will only think that you're too narrow-minded. A King ... Isn't like that ..."BOOM!A loud bang rang out, followed by a blood-curdling scream that resounded through the heavens and earth!The sword pierced through heaven and earth, cutting off the great path. Zheng Hongyuan's screams reverberated wildly in the void. Boom ... The world changed color, and the origin was broken. A large amount of Origin Energy was instantly absorbed by the Redwoods and the Imperial Guards.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked calmly at red dust in the distance. Red dust's shadow trembled slightly, but he didn't say anything. He just looked at Li Hao silently.Li Hao tilted his head, looked at him, and smiled.""It's a pity that you weren't there when we killed Zheng Gong. You didn't see it! What was the layout? What was a King? Hong Chen ... No, Zheng Yu, your father is dead. Are you happy?"Li Hao smiled."Your father said that you have the bearing of an Emperor. If I kill him, I'll release the demon in your heart ... I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to the moment when we fight!"As he spoke, his long sword instantly broke through the sky!Hong Chen's clone snorted and threw a punch that shattered the sky and earth.The world had already recovered a little. At this moment, his clone wasn't weak either. However, in an instant, the long sword pierced through and the world trembled. A huge city came pressing down. Hong Chen's expression changed slightly and he disappeared from where he was.Hurricane city also disappeared in an instant, and Hong Chen's voice reverberated,""Li Hao ... You'll pay the price!""Trash!"Li Hao didn't give chase. He just sneered."If your original body doesn't dare to come out, I'll look down on you! I killed your father in front of you, and you didn't dare to come out because you were afraid of a venerable sovereign ... What price do you want me to pay for this? If I had your abilities, I would make whoever dared to kill my father and master in front of me suffer a fate worse than death, even if the world were to shatter! Zheng Yu ... Are you even worthy of being called a devil? It's no wonder you're only hanging out in Silver Moon. A person like you can't even be called a demon, and you'll stay like this for the rest of your life!"Li Hao stood proudly in the air and sneered.""You're so powerful. If you walk out of your original body, killing me will be as easy as taking something from your pocket. I'm betting my life on you walking out. If that's the case, you're still someone!"Unfortunately, he didn 't.A half-step sovereign had witnessed his father's great Dao being severed. If he wanted to, he could have walked out in an instant to kill Li Hao and stop him from severing his father's great Dao. However, it might have caused the seal to break and a venerable sovereign to appear.However, a venerable sovereign who had been sealed for many years ... Might just be like that.This way, the other party did not dare to take the risk.At this moment, the people nearby had complicated feelings. That's right!Zheng Yu ... Didn't dare to walk out.Li Hao was also extremely bold.Just now, if the other party had been willing to come out, Li Hao might not have had the chance to escape to the bright star sector. This guy was really gambling with his life, but in the end, Zheng Yu did not come out.He only said a few harsh words.Li Fuhai muttered,"I told you ... A guy who hasn't won in a hundred thousand years ... Is nothing!"If the other party was really capable, he would really come out.It wasn't that he was being reckless ... It was just that his father was right in front of him, and he was on the verge of death. A weakling dared to kill his father in front of him, but he didn't even dare to step out. How could such a fellow achieve Dao?At worst, I'll kill Li Hao first, and then find a way to fight that venerable sovereign who broke out of the seal ... He's been sealed for so many years, and perhaps ... He's only on par with you."This is an Emperor-to-be?"Li Hao's laughter resounded in all directions. He looked up at the sky with a brilliant smile. At this moment, his smile appeared on the sky."The Zheng family betrayed us, and I killed Zheng Hongyuan for you! Zheng Yu had stepped into the Emperor-to-be realm ... It seemed like ... He was nothing more than this! I really want to see how powerful a true neo Martial Emperor-to-be is. A true Emperor-to-be like Zheng Yu has lost the title of venerable sovereign!""Neo martial seniors, you must be ashamed of this. I killed your father in front of you, but you don't even dare to make a move ... How ridiculous!"At this moment, the ancient cities were deathly silent.Suddenly, he seemed to have lost all his energy.A new emperor-to-be ...No way ... A true neo Martial Emperor-to-be was not like this. At this moment, there was only one thought in his mind. Zheng Yu of the Zheng family had lost all the face of neo martial arts. Even being a traitor was embarrassing!The Father of an Emperor-to-be expert was killed by a Saint right in front of him. He could have stopped him by taking a step forward, but the other party didn 't!Damn it!​ Bastard!……Li Hao's smile became even more brilliant. He laughed out loud."If you don't want to save him, then don't come! He came and saw it with his own eyes, but he didn't dare to appear ... If he didn't appear, he would've cut off his feelings and had a bit of a demonic heart ... Hypocritical and cowardly, he's really ... Trash!"Li Hao laughed out loud!At this moment, he felt that the Emperor-to-be was not scary, nor was the venerable sovereign!This old fogey of the Silvermoon world ... Just as li Fuhai had said, there were not many to be afraid of.

Chapter 2133 Face-To-Face Revenge (3)
All trash!No wonder it was still the same after a hundred thousand years.However, it was this group of people who caused his parents, friends, and teachers to die ...It was really ... Infuriating!At this moment, behind him, the world suddenly shook. The movement was not small, but it was not too big either. It was not as powerful as when the other side's great Dao was broken. But Li Hao turned around and smiled.At this moment, the Redwood returned to its original form, which expanded several times in size. Its aura was turbulent. At this moment, Li Hao threw out countless energy stones, which the Redwood absorbed crazily.In the blink of an eye, his aura stabilized a little.However, he was still a little weaker than the ninth master, but he seemed to have barely entered the saintly way. He had been at the peak of immortal realm for a long time, but his origin had been cut off, so he couldn't improve.Today, after absorbing the origin power of a Heavenly King, he had barely entered the Saint path.It was just that ... Now that he had entered the divine path, there was not much movement, and the transformation was not obvious, but he had still entered it.Hong Mu was overjoyed, and without waiting for his realm to stabilize, he hurriedly transformed into a human and bowed deeply, extremely respectful,""Many thanks to Lord Marquis for granting my wish!""You fought for it yourself!"Li Hao smiled and looked at the Emperor guard not far away. At this moment, the Emperor Guard's body was also shimmering with golden light. He had only been a peak Emperor guard before, but he had already entered the immortal level a few times before. He had just entered the immortal level.At this moment, he seemed to have improved again. Not bad.He should be in the middle or late stage of immortal realm, at the fifth or sixth level of the sun Moon realm.At this moment, a large city floated in the air. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ In the city, experts revealed themselves and shouted,""Congratulations on reaching the Dao integration stage, Lord Marquis!"Boundless city.These people were all here.Li Hao smiled and said,""We should be happy together! You've all improved as well ... But now that I've reached the Dao integration stage, I've reached the limit of the world. You must all reach the Dao integration stage as soon as possible and fight alongside me against the enemy!"Now that he had reached the Dao integration realm, these people would be able to reach the ninth stage of the sun Moon realm even if they couldn 't.Unfortunately, only director Zhao had entered the 7th stage.As for the others, the stronger ones were currently on their way to the sixth stage of Sun Moon tier. For example, Lin Hongyu and the others were still quite a distance away from the seventh stage."What's the result of killing nine saints?"Li Hao asked.In an instant, Lin Hongyu flew over and glanced at the Redwood in the distance. Her eyes were filled with joy, but she did not show it. Soon, she handed a storage ring to Li Hao.As for Li Hao, he took a deep breath and said, today ... We'll share the victory! The legacy of the Nine Saints, I hope that everyone will have the opportunity to improve! In addition, the opportunity to resurrect Jiang Ying, li, and the other fellow Daoists has arrived! Everyone ... Seize this opportunity. The natural recovery of the world is getting faster and faster. Once the chaos dissipates, the second recovery will come in an instant. Perhaps we'll be facing Zheng Yu's crazy revenge!"The legacy of the Nine Saints!At this moment, Li Hao was about to share it. Everyone was overjoyed.Li Hao also disappeared. In an instant, he disappeared. While everyone was still in doubt, the sky was torn apart. At this moment, Li Hao brought in the demon-hunter guards. The others didn't say anything, but were a little envious.These people were very far away. Clearly, Li Hao had torn the void through the bright star sector to receive them.At the same time, Li Hao was about to share the fruits of his victory.Suddenly, his eyes flickered.In the distance, the void trembled.A smile suddenly appeared on his face.Everyone was stunned. It had been a long time since they had seen Li Hao smile so sincerely. Recently, Li Hao had actually smiled a lot, but ... He always felt that it was a little fake.But at this moment, he seemed to be smiling very sincerely.At this moment, the void trembled continuously.A big black dog was crazily breaking through the void. Its aura seemed very powerful, but he felt that it was probably only at the third or fourth stage of the sun Moon realm. It wasn't too powerful.Woof! Woof! Woof!A large black dog's nose twitched as it crossed over thousands of mountains and rivers, incomparably excited as it rushed over.Li Hao was also looking in that direction, waiting in silence.A moment later, a huge dog came through the void.In an instant, it pounced on Li Hao.With a bang, his head almost exploded. He looked at Li Hao in confusion. Li Hao's body is so hard!Li Hao laughed so hard that it seemed like he was going to flip the world over!"Your dog nose ... Is very sharp!""I just killed a few Saints and wanted to share them with everyone, and then you came ... Black Panther, you've actually come out of seclusion!"Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther was also very happy. It had been in seclusion for a long time, but it had also gained something. It had found the Dao Meridian of the new era's demon race and had also opened up some Dao meridians. Otherwise, it would not have been able to possess the power of the sun and moon.The demons had been unable to find their Dao meridians. The Black Panther had been following Li Hao, Yuan Shuo, and the others. No one had hidden anything from it. This dog had been in seclusion for a long time.This time, he had actually come out of seclusion."Woof woof woof ..."Li Hao was overjoyed, and so was the Black Panther. After barking for a while, it looked around with some doubt in its dog eyes. Had it been in seclusion for a long time?Everyone is so amazing!But ... Why were some people not here?Li Hao didn't have many people close to him, and neither did it. Li Hao was one of them, followed by Liu Long, and then Yuan Shuo. Liu Long was the one who enlightened it on martial arts, and could even be considered its teacher.

It had been practicing Liu Long's "ninth-form force" since the beginning of its cultivation. Perhaps, Black Panther was the strongest in the path of the ninth-form force.It looked around, and Li Hao knew what it was thinking. He patted the huge dog's head and smiled."They ... Are in deep sleep.""Woof ..."Heibao was stunned for a moment, as if he had understood something.In the next moment, it suddenly raised its head and let out a long howl that was like a Wolf's howl. It was so loud that it could swallow the world!An extremely powerful devouring force burst out from its body, devouring the void. Its howl was filled with killing intent as it roared continuously!In the distance, the hearts of a few powerhouses were slightly moved.The bloodline of the heavenly Hound was proficient in the Dao of devouring.Both Supreme Emperor sky dog and demon subduing envoy were experts in the Dao of devouring. However, this Black dog's devouring power was extremely strong despite its mixed bloodline. It was somewhat unexpected.Could it be that another top-notch great demon was about to appear?Li Fuhai also sighed.This bloodline ... Will be the lifelong enemy of the water Tribe!Damn, this dog, I thought he was dead, why did he come out again?Luckily, this dog was good at devouring and wouldn't fight with him for the physical body.The Black Panther, on the other hand, roared for a while, nudged Li Hao with its head, and no longer said anything.The joy from before had disappeared.In the future, I won't be in seclusion anymore.Li Hao also smiled and patted Black Panther's head. Ever since he left the silver Blizzard city, he had brought this dog with him. Now, this dog was the only one left. His teacher had always said that he should just stew it, but he didn't expect ... His teacher would leave first."Enter the city and upgrade!"Li Hao entered the city, and so did the other experts.After a while, auras shook the ancient city. The body of a Saint was scattered by Li Hao, and all kinds of forces seeped out. Among them, the aura of chaos was the densest. Li Hao devoured it directly. The Redwood was overjoyed and began devouring crazily.The group of people disappeared. Li Hao was not in a hurry to enter the ruins of Star Town City. There might be some benefits waiting for him there. He would digest what he had obtained before.……Hurricane city.The red dust World stood unmoving, and around it, powerful experts appeared, many, many.All the experts were silent.This time, they had lost three saints. And that wasn't all. Li Hao had gone crazy!He had provoked and humiliated Hong Chen right in front of him. He had even killed the head of the Zheng family. At this moment, no one dared to even breathe loudly.As for Hong Chen, he was silent for a moment. His eyes were cold as he looked at the crowd and said in a low voice,""Do you think I would kill Li Hao first if I walked out just now, or would the red moon sovereign break the seal and come out first?"No one below dared to speak. After a moment of silence, a Saint summoned up his courage and said,""Milord doesn't need to pay attention to Li Hao's provocation. As long as Milord controls the world and the great Dao ... The old head will definitely have a chance to be resurrected! If you go out now and release Red Moon sovereign, all lives will be lost and the destruction of Silver Moon will be imminent. My Lord is doing this for the sake of the entire Silver Moon ..."Red dust remained silent."The recovery of the world is accelerating," someone said cautiously."As long as the world is stable for a while, the Saints will be able to leave Hurricane city. At that time ... We'll slaughter Li Hao's people ..."Red dust didn't say anything. After a long time, he said,""Li Hao ... Is crazy! I'm still awake, but he's gone crazy! Now that the world has recovered a little, my undying body can already walk out. Send people to the West to find Ying Hongyue ... And protect her!" "What?""Ying Hongyue is in danger!"Red dust seemed to have regained his calm,'he and the moon goddess are the key to the seal! "Once the world recovers, it'll be enough for me to leave. At that time, if Li Hao can't fight me, he'll definitely kill Ying Hongyue and the moon goddess and release the red moon sovereign! There was also the Silver city's seal ... Hurricane city had to be teleported over there! Li Hao has gone completely crazy. He actually forced me to leave Hurricane city ..."Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that he didn't mention anything else. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ However ... Did Li Hao really dare to release the red moon Emperor?As for Hong Chen, he spoke again,'his great Dao universe actually moved heaven battling city into it! Heaven battling city can accommodate tens of millions of people. This person might have the intention of dying together and teleported some people into heaven battling city. Even if the seal is broken, Hong Yue might not be able to easily find the traces of the great path universe ... He's getting more and more dangerous!"Everyone was shocked!That's true!Red dust suddenly said,'Li Hao wanted to destroy my Dao heart, but he didn't know that. Instead, he exposed his own background! "What he relies on is the great Dao universe ... If we can enter the great Dao universe, it will be the time of his death! Gods ... We can work together. "With that, he looked into the distance, his eyes turning colder.Li Hao ... Do you really think that I can't do anything to you?You've killed Zheng Gong and my father, which strengthened my Dao heart. Perhaps I should have a talk with the red moon sovereign.In an instant, the ancient city disappeared.At this moment, the experts in the city were more at ease. There were many experts and strong saintly way auras, but they were all helpless. Such a powerful hurricane city couldn't do anything to Li Hao, and they were also frustrated.​ ……At the same time.Zhang an walked between the heaven and earth, as if he was not suppressed in any way. He shuttled through the void, but he arrived at the Silver City one step ahead of time.Standing below the seal and looking up at the sky, he seemed to see the seal's existence.He stared at the sky for a while.In his eyes, a red line seemed to appear, a red line that could only be seen by the eight great families, but at this moment, it appeared in his eyes. The eight great families were also bound by the Supreme martial artist.After pondering for a moment, Zhang an's spirit rose, and it quickly rose along a red line.Soon, a vast starry sky appeared in his eyes.In an instant, a powerful existence opened his eyes and looked in their direction. As for Zhang an, he only took a glance and didn't pay much attention to it. He looked around for a while, and soon, he saw an ancient city in the depths of the void.Sword city!The ancient city seemed to be dead.Zhang an looked at it for a while, and his eyes flickered. A moment later, he seemed to have understood something. Soon, before the venerable sovereign could say anything, his spiritual energy disappeared.Red Moon sovereign frowned as he was about to speak.He left?Who ... Was this person?Below the Silver City, Zhang an frowned slightly. He looked around and disappeared again.Before he left, his eyes were still a little solemn and a little doubtful.Sword city ... Might be empty!

Chapter 2135 Starfall Ruins (2 In 1)
Boundless city.The power of the Nine Saints 'flesh and blood filled the world.Although the power of the origin was not very helpful to the new Dao, the power of flesh and blood, the power of immortality, and high-level energy were greatly beneficial to everyone's cultivation.But Li Hao was frowning.Everyone's aperture opening speed was fast.But ... He was a little worried.This was because he realized that the blood essence of the fey race, or desolate beasts, or even humans, could speed up the opening of the aperture. Furthermore, it was very effective.It was very fast! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ It was a good thing.However, it was also a bad thing.In this way, it might lead to a battle between humans and demons. When humans killed each other, they would absorb blood essence and open apertures at a speed that was several times or even ten times faster than usual!How many people could resist such a temptation?At this moment, a drop of desolate beast blood had entered his body. An aperture was rapidly opened, and it was much faster than usual.It wasn't just him. In fact, everyone had noticed it.In the past, everyone had killed very few demons, so they didn't feel much.But today, everyone had some enlightenment. The speed of opening apertures was very fast, and the blood of these desolate beasts seemed to be very nourishing. They didn't know if it was because of the desolate beasts or because of the opponent's Sage level.Beside him, everyone was rapidly opening their meridians.There were a total of nine saints. On Li Hao's side, there weren't many sun and moon experts. The energy they emitted was enough to raise everyone's strength.At this moment, director Zhao took a deep breath and officially stepped into the 7th stage of the sun Moon realm.Not far away, Wang Ye also let out a low shout. His qi and blood shook, and he opened his Dao meridians, stepping into the seventh level of Sun Moon tier. Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows. Director Wang was only an undying previously, but in comparison, he was only at the middle stage of Sun Moon tier.The other party had switched to a new Dao and advanced instead of retreating. With such speed, he had stepped into the seventh stage of Sun Moon tier.The seventh level of the sun Moon realm was even stronger than some peak immortal realm experts.Li Hao felt emotional. Director Wang was the first neo martial artist to change his path. It seemed that he had some opportunities.He didn't think too much about it. At this moment, several weapons appeared in front of him.9.The nine young people from the venerable sovereign family, perhaps they were young people?In the battle of boundless city, Jiang Yingli and the other descendants of venerable sovereigns who chose to serve the new era had made their choices and paid the price. They had completely fallen silent again to suppress the city Lord token of boundless city.With the self-destruction of the starry sky sword, it was difficult for Li Hao's side to resist the city leader token. In the end, the nine descendants of the venerable sovereigns suppressed the token by force and eliminated the supremely powerful means.Li Hao had once said that he would resurrect them.Returning the favor.Since these people had chosen the new era and Li Hao, Li Hao would not ignore their opportunity. In his hands, flesh bodies appeared. These physical bodies were no small matter.They were all forged from the qi and blood of saints and even Heavenly Kings.Li Hao continuously purified this energy and extracted a large amount of spring of life to forge his body ...After forging for a while, Li Hao glanced at Jiang Yingli's physical body. He suddenly felt like laughing. He recalled the last time this fellow had said that he had peeked at her ... And the last time, someone had said that Jiang Yingli's physical body was actually fatter than the physical body he had forged. Jiang Yingli had made a false statement.In that case ... Should he help her restore her original appearance?Li Hao fell into deep thought.He then thought, if the cast was a little fatter, would this woman die of anger when she came back to life?As he thought to himself, he chuckled. He still cast her into the same appearance as last time. Since she didn't want to be fatter, he would fulfill her wish.Soon, nine bodies appeared.However, Li Hao was more concerned this time. He had only forged 36 Dao meridians last time. Due to the limited resources, he had only used a small portion of the body of a quasi-Heavenly King.This time, he had even killed a Heavenly King, so he did not lack these.Li Hao carefully carved the Dao meridians.This time, he had even made some adjustments to make it more suitable for the opening of meridians.Their spiritual power was still there, but they were in a deep sleep. It was not difficult to merge their bodies. However, Li Hao could not reveal all the meridians in the human body. Even he could not do it.In the future, it would be troublesome for them to open new meridians after opening all of them ... Li Hao couldn't do anything about it. It would depend on their own luck.After all, his new physical body was not a natural one.In terms of potential, they were actually not as good as the current human race. However ... How many people had actually cultivated to that level?At that point, there would naturally be a way to solve it.Li Hao thought to himself as he continued to form his Dao Meridian.This time, he was prepared to form 360 Dao meridians for these people. When they cultivated to the extreme, they would have the power of a half-step sovereign. It was hard to say if they could reach this point.A large amount of energy was being absorbed by Li Hao.Small dragons appeared around their Natal divine weapons and quickly entered their bodies.After an unknown amount of time, nine bodies appeared in front of Li Hao, flickering with light.Li Hao looked at them for a while and then helped them put on their clothes.If one looked at it too much, it would burn one's eyes.When he thought about how the energy of these bodies came from the desolate beasts and Zheng Hongyuan's group ... Li Hao didn't have any thoughts at all. Pink skeletons, no matter how beautiful they looked, couldn't hide the fact that they were a pile of flesh and blood.The nine figures surrounded Li Hao.At this moment, he only needed to wake up their spiritual power. However, these nine people were all in a deep sleep. It would be a big trouble to wake them up.

Chapter 2136 Starfall Ruins (2)
However, Li Hao was also prepared.At this moment, he didn't directly wake them up. Instead, he took their physical bodies and instantly entered the bright star realm.Nine bodies stood in different areas of the Galaxy.A piece of divine text floated above Li Hao's head.The text of Dao!At this moment, the divine character "Dao" let out a loud trembling sound, like the sound of the great Dao. It fell on their bodies, and a few dim stars appeared in the Galaxy.Those were the new Dao stars that they had left behind here.However, as his spiritual energy became dormant, it had long dimmed.At this moment, as the sound of the great Dao trembled, a few stars began to flicker with a faint radiance. A thin line connected them to the stars. Li Hao took a look and was quite satisfied.The current him was even more clear and enlightened about these things.If it was before, he might have to wake them up by force, but that would cause great damage to their spiritual power, and it would take a lot of time to recover.But now, they were using the 'Dao' character to communicate with their Natal stars. This way, they would naturally recover. Although they were very weak, they wouldn't hurt their foundations.Gradually, their bodies trembled.A weak spiritual force seemed to be starting to recover.,m Li Hao kept vibrating the "Dao" character. The power of the great Dao gushed out of the divine character and poured into the stars. Li Hao's face was pale. The power of the great Dao spreading was a kind of damage to himself.However, he didn't really care.The nine students of Yuanping martial arts university, the descendants of venerable sovereigns, had chosen to stand up and attack at that time. As a Martial Master, Li Hao naturally knew to return the favor.After an unknown period of time, a star started to shine.His body started to tremble.In his physical body, the mental energy that had been dormant in his weapon started to awaken, and his eyelids twitched.After a while, one of the nine people slowly opened his eyes.What entered his eyes was a sky full of stars!"Is this the world after death?"The figure murmured. The Silver Moon didn't have so many stars. At this moment, these were the only things that were reflected in his eyes, so he naturally didn't think it was the Silver Moon.Where am I?After death, wouldn't they completely disappear?Or would he completely disappear into the darkness?"Is the world after death so beautiful?"Li Hao's voice came with a smile.""There are many happy events today. Seeing that you have recovered, it can be considered that one of my worries has been resolved."Jiang Yingli quickly turned her head to look and was stunned for a moment.In the next moment, he quickly touched his face, then his body, and then the two lumps on his chest ...Li Hao's face darkened.You've just recovered, and this is the first thing you care about?"I'm ... Alive?"Jiang Yingli was overjoyed! "You're not dead," Li Hao said indifferently."It's just that your mental power is weak and you've fallen into a deep sleep. You guys were able to survive because your mental power was strong in the past.""Hahaha, I'm alive!"Jiang Yingli didn't care about this. At this moment, she was laughing madly.She was alive again!She had fallen into a deep sleep 100000 years ago. After waking up with great difficulty, she fell into a deep sleep again. She was actually very desperate. She didn't expect that she would come back to life."How many years has it been?"She asked in a hurry."A few months.""What?""A month or so!""It can't be?"  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  This time, was it so fast?Jiang Yingli was a little dazed. At this moment, a few people nearby also slowly opened their eyes. They heard the conversation between the two and were a little surprised.He thought that it had been a few years.Of course, they didn't think that too long had passed ... That they might not have a chance to recover.However, a month was too fast.No wonder it felt like he had only fallen asleep for a moment.The few of them looked at each other. The others were different from Jiang Yingli. They checked each other's physical bodies and felt it. They were all surprised. This time, their physical bodies were much stronger than before.The number of Dao meridians had also increased.It felt like ... It was no weaker than their original bodies.This time, it was a blessing in disguise?Where was this place?"This is the bright star field, the great Dao universe!"Everyone's heart moved. At this moment, they looked around and saw the stars in the sky. They also saw their own stars. They sensed something and each of them revealed a strange expression.Was this the great Dao universe?Li Hao looked at them and said,"this place is suitable for opening your meridians. You've just recovered, so you still have enough energy. Take this opportunity to cultivate. Your bodies are made of the flesh and blood of Heavenly Kings, so they can withstand a lot of energy. Don't worry about your bodies not being able to withstand it!"The few of them were slightly moved. Without saying anything, they sat down cross-legged and began to cultivate.The stars swallowed the heaven and earth, and the power of the great Dao spread out. The divine character 'Dao' was still overflowing with the power of the great Dao. Jiang Yingli also began to cultivate. She looked up at Li Hao and suddenly said,""Take back the divine text ...""Cultivate your way!"Li Hao's tone was calm. Jiang Yingli mumbled and cursed in her heart, you don't know what's good for you!The few of them stopped talking and began to cultivate.The Dao Meridian had just been built, so it was very smooth to activate.Although their mental strength was a little weak, it was also recovering quickly. The power of the great Dao was not lacking around them. They were not weak to begin with, and they had the experience of enlightening the apertures last time. Soon, they opened one aperture after another.It didn't take long for them to return to the mountain sea level.

Chapter 2137 Starfall Ruins (3)
The nine of them continued to cultivate and felt that it was much easier than the last time. Gradually, they opened their apertures faster and faster.After an unknown period of time, the few of them stopped cultivating.At this moment, the energy in his body had almost been completely absorbed and digested, and Li Hao's divine character 'Dao' had also been withdrawn.All of them had opened 225 apertures, which was the peak of the mountain sea realm.If they opened again, they would enter the sun and moon.Li Hao said,"calm down and carefully sense the power of the mountains and seas. Entering the sun and moon realm is only a matter of a blink of an eye. It's just that I opened my aperture too quickly, so I don't have a deep understanding of the mountains and seas. Although the mountains and seas are not as good as the mountain peaks, this is a new Dao. There's no harm in experiencing it more."The few of them did not say much. Jiang Yingli looked around and suddenly, her eyes moved. She looked into the distance. There seemed to be a big city there."That's ...""Heaven battling city,""What?"They were all greatly shocked. Heaven battling city was in the great path universe?How was that possible?"I moved it here!"Okay.They couldn't help but sigh. This guy was really amazing. He even moved a main city here. More importantly, this meant that heaven battling city had completely submitted to Li Hao."Have we taken down boundless city?"Jiang Ying and the others quickly approached Li Hao. They had been in a deep sleep and hadn't seen the results yet."Yes."Li Hao nodded slightly."We did. Not just boundless city, but heaven battling city as well. You've seen it for yourself. In addition, we also killed a guy who pretended to be in the ruins of star suppression city. Zheng Hongyuan of the Zheng family."The referee and the others were stunned for a moment. Didn't she say that she had only been asleep for a month?How did Zheng Hongyuan die as well?"Let's go out first!"Li Hao didn't say much. A giant dragon emerged from his body, and the passage opened. In an instant, he left the bright star sector with the others.……Boundless city.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  A few people appeared.Jiang Yingli's body stiffened slightly. She sensed her surroundings and took a deep breath. There were fluctuations of aura nearby. Why did she feel that there were many powerful people?Soon, she saw the people around her.At this moment, everyone's auras were constantly fluctuating. They were much stronger than last time.More importantly, she also saw some powerhouses from the new martial era. Especially when she saw that bull. She was stunned for a moment. This ... This was the power of the water Tribe, li Fuhai, right?This was a Saint-level expert! More importantly, she was a direct descendant of the venerable sovereign. The shuishui family was not any weaker than her Jiang family.Other than the heavenly Hound clan, this clan could be said to be the most powerful clan in the demon race."The sea Protector?"Jiang Yingli looked at the others, and Li Fuhai also looked at them. He nodded his head slightly and said,""It's a good fortune for you to survive! "If the Stargate is opened, we can still return to neo martial arts. It can be considered an opportunity for you ...""However, as descendants of venerable sovereigns, nine of you failed to suppress the city Master token. It seems that after so many years, you've become quite useless," he said in a mature tone.“……”The descendants of venerable sovereigns were a little disgusted and speechless.This fellow ... He was scolding them like a parent, but they couldn't say anything.General Huai and the others would not say that about them, because they were the descendants of venerable sovereigns, while general Huai and the others were not.However, this person was a genuine third generation descendant of the venerable sovereign.In terms of status, Zhang an was probably the only one in Silver Moon who could barely suppress him, but ... Zhang an's position was not that high, so it would still depend on their abilities to determine who had a higher status.Now that they had been taught a lesson by a human ... By a bull, they had nothing to say. They were speechless and did not make a sound.The old turtle and the others glanced at him but didn't say anything.He laughed in his heart.The status of the students from Yuanping martial Sciences University was too high. They were usually very polite. Today, seeing these students being taught a lesson by a bull, it was not a bad idea to watch the fun.At this moment, Li Hao interrupted their conversation."I'm almost done with my cultivation!"Li Hao looked around at the crowd and nodded slightly.""Not bad. The nine sages weren't wasted. However, after killing nine sages, we only have one more Sage. It's still a pity ..."Only the Redwood had advanced to the Saint level.As for the others, Lin Hongyu had actually advanced to the seventh stage of the sun Moon tier ... There was a 99% chance that Hong feimu had given her special treatment. Hong feimu had decided to focus on the Dao of chaos. Although the great Dao had not been connected, it had left behind some marks in the chaotic region.He absorbed the chaotic energy even faster. He converted it into other forms of energy and secretly provided Lin Hongyu with some.As such, Lin Hongyu was quite lucky to become the second person on Silver moon's side to reach the seventh stage of the sun Moon tier after director Zhao. Director Wang was temporarily excluded.The others, including Tian Jian, Huang Yu, Qian Wuliang, and Hong Yitang, were only at the middle stage of Sun Moon realm. However, these few had reached the sixth level.He wasn't too far from the 7th rank.Not bad.This time, some people also reached the sun Moon realm. Almost all the latecomers like Dao Jian took the opportunity to reach the sun Moon realm, which increased the number of Sun Moon experts on Li Hao's side.Director Zhou never changed his body, and Li Hao didn't try to persuade him. This time, he had improved a lot. From his aura, his body had probably reached the undying level.Regarding director Zhou's insistence ...... Li Hao was a little suspicious.A new Dao was indeed much easier to train in than an essence Dao.Now, the universe of origin was no longer there, but director Zhou was still insistant ... Perhaps it was because the person who helped him change his body had a special relationship with him. Perhaps, he was like his master, so he couldn't give up the body that the other party had exchanged his life for. He could only continue to practice the path of origin.

Chapter 2138 Starfall Ruins (2 In 1)(2 In 1)
If director Zhou had changed his body earlier, maybe ... He wouldn't be weaker than director Zhao and the others.This person's strength was quite good before.Lin Hongyu and the others were not even as good as him before.As for Liu Yan and the others, they were slightly stronger than before. However, they had yet to enter the middle stage of the sun Moon realm and were only at the third level of the sun Moon realm. In terms of strength, they were slightly weaker than some of the older martial masters.However, the five of them walked the five elements Dao. If they worked together, they would not be weak.Li Hao finally laughed.The middle stage of the sun Moon realm was considered undying.It was still alright!In such a short time, the Silver Moon Martial Master had improved a lot, and his Army was strong! no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  Today, Jiang Ying, li, and the others had also recovered.There were also a few Zhan Tian commanders who had changed their positions previously, and they had all improved quite a bit. There were also a few silver commanders in the star Army who had also improved ... They were all very good!"This battle can be considered a complete victory!"Li Hao looked at the crowd and said,"next, military governor Lin, you guys will follow the old rules and continue doing what you should do. As for the other military governors, you will cooperate with the demon-hunter Guardian Army and guard the other ancient cities!""Next, ignore Hurricane city! Our target ... Is the Western divine Kingdom!" Li Hao said slowly,"also, I'll meet with the barren King and the other leaders of the barren territory later. They can walk freely, but that White Horse can't enter and leave boundless city as it pleases. Boundless city needs a top-notch expert to guard it!"He looked at the crowd for a long time before looking at Yi Fuhai,""Senior seatopple, can you stay in borderless city?""Yes, sir!"Li Fuhai was very straightforward. He knew what Li Hao was thinking. If the White Horse was killed, it would instantly recover a second time. He understood this.Boundless city had a Saint like him to keep watch. At the moment, there were not enough Saints to enter and leave the outside world, so it was naturally very safe.Li Hao nodded.He did not make any more arrangements.He was about to end the conversation when he saw Qian Wuliang looking at him expectantly."This guy has indeed taken a few risks this time and his strength has improved, but he didn't enter the seventh stage of Sun Moon realm."The benefits and risks did not seem to be on the same level.If he had entered the seventh stage, the benefits and risks would be equal, but now ... He obviously still had some desire.Whether he went to the Li Dynasty or pretended to be Li Hao, facing several Saints ... It was a life-and-death task.Li Hao was actually angry at him, but he didn't continue to be angry at him.Seeing that he was looking at him carefully, Li Hao thought for a moment and said,""Also, Qian Wuliang ...""Your subordinate is here!"Qian Wuliang stepped out in a hurry. All the positions that Li Hao arranged for the four military governors, the star military governor, and the administrative Governor had been taken. Now, he was all alone and had no identity.Li Hao glanced at him and smiled."The capable should do more work. Right now, I still need to decide whether I should forcefully take down the Zhao family's martial Union, the Hong family's thunderstorm city, and the Zhang family's dingtian city or leave them be ... I still need you to continue visiting the three ancient cities!""The Zhou clan's Galaxy city ... I can't be sure if it's one of the rebellious cities. If it's possible, I'll need you to go on a diplomatic mission,""You'll be the appeasing Ambassador for the time being! Attack, attack, make peace, negotiate ... Make your decision after you leave!"Qian Wuliang's eyes changed.The appeasing Ambassador was nothing, nor was sending an Ambassador a big deal. The key was ... He could decide the conquest?This ... This was nothing!Li Hao had given him the right to deal with neo martial or not ...The next moment, he saw the old turtle and the others out of the corner of his eye. He secretly gasped in his heart. My God, this is another huge trouble!If he advocated for the annihilation ... Would these few new martial Saints be polite to him?If he wanted peace, would the Silver Moon Martial Master be polite to him?Oh my God!Lord Marquis's plan ... Does this mean that he values me?No matter what he chose, he would definitely offend one party!The Silver Moon Martial Master was bent on conquering, and the old turtle and the other new martial artists felt that if the main cities hadn't betrayed them, they definitely wouldn't want to go to war with them. Instead, they wanted to rope them in and negotiate.This ... No matter which one he chose, he would be hated by one side.Did he really want to be alone?In fact, he had some understanding in his heart.Li Hao actually valued him, but ... He had to be a loner.At this moment, Qian Wuliang suppressed his thoughts and said in a hurry,"Lord Marquis, don't worry. I will do my duty and investigate the situation. If there is a rebellion in the main city, I will definitely attack! If the main city hasn't betrayed us, we will also restrain them ..."Li Hao nodded."This mission is quite dangerous. After all, there are Saints in the main city. You're only at the sixth level of the sun Moon tier. You haven't reached the seventh level yet!" How about this ... I'll give you a set of golden armor for self-defense!"Golden armor!Boundless city had one, and so did heaven battling city.However, Li Hao hadn't actually given it to them yet.Currently, other than him using Wu Peng's commander armor, the Silvermoon Martial Master had silver armors, but he didn't have any golden armors yet.Qian Wuliang's expression changed.The Golden armor ... Was used by a division commander.So far, there were all kinds of positions under Li Hao's command, but the highest rank in the military was only Regiment commander. There was no division commander. Although Li Hao didn't say that he would be given the position of division commander ... But if he was given the position of division commander, would he be the number one in the military?

Chapter 2139 Starfall Ruins (1)
Li Hao didn't say much. A set of golden armor fell into his hands. Qian Wuliang said in a hurry,"Many thanks to Lord Marquis for the reward!""You've made great contributions in battle, you deserve it!"Then, he looked around and said,""Director Wang Ye, you need someone who is familiar with the main cities to cooperate with Qian Wuliang in order to avoid any misunderstandings. I have been kind to the main cities, but the situation is still unclear. If these main cities are willing to cooperate with me to get rid of the traitors, I don't want to do anything to them. There are many spies in the invasion of the Crimson Moon ... I hope you can understand. "The few of them did not say anything and just nodded.This was the truth.Even Wu Peng had betrayed them ... To be honest, even the old turtle and the others were very depressed. They felt that they could not trust the other main cities.Otherwise, there would definitely be some noise this time.But if even the commander of the heaven battling Army could betray him, who wouldn 't?If the other clans were willing to cooperate and take the initiative to investigate and find some rebels, they would feel that it was not a bad idea. If they were not willing to cooperate ... Then there was nothing they could do. They could not expect Li Hao to not care about them."Lord Marquis, do we still need to continue with the four continents migration?" director Zhao asked."Continue!"Li Hao nodded."This matter is led by director Zhao and Governor Lin. Both of you have reached the seventh level of the sun Moon tier. Moving the city is slightly difficult ... But it's still possible for senior seatopple to control boundless city and help out a little!" I have to merge the four continents together and move the water ... I only moved it a little before. If I don't move the water of the four Seas, it will cause some great hidden dangers!""We need the help of water and earth element cultivators. Also, the shifting of the city, the change in climate, and the change in farming may cause some changes. We need director Zhao to send someone to guide us!"After he finished speaking, he finally looked at the Redwood."Now, heaven and earth can withstand the appearance of immortality. The Yao plant Army also needs to help stabilize the land and nourish it so that the land is suitable for farming!""Yes!" Sequoia hurriedly accepted the order,"the monster plant Army will definitely complete the consolidation of the world!" This time, the Yao plant Army will also help the world produce more food ... Improve the climate, and fertilize the land ... It just needs to consume some energy ...""There are still some remnants of the Heavenly Star Mine. Send people to dig them out. Use whatever resources you have. There's no need to keep them!""Yes, sir!"The Sequoia was overjoyed. In this way, the Yao plant Army could also walk freely between the heaven and earth. Except for the Saint who had just advanced, the heaven and earth could already bear immortality. Freedom actually represented a kind of trust.Li Hao was willing to hand over some missions to them. This was a sign of trust. As expected, when the Yao plant Army intercepted Leiting, they were rewarded.Director Zhao and the others were filled with emotions. These neo martial artists had all changed.In the past, they were all indifferent. Now, they would take the initiative to accept some missions.Li Hao continued,"there's one more thing. Some of the heaven battling Army has already recovered. It's no longer suitable for them to stay in heaven battling city. They're too lonely!" Since you've been resurrected, come out and do something. "He looked at the ninth master and the others."The world has changed. Times have changed. It is necessary to let everyone come out and interact more!" The resurrected soldiers of the heaven battling Army would become the instructors and captains of the demon-hunter armies, filling up the bottom level! If we merge into one and become part of this era ... The fighting spirit will continue to exist. I hope that the current one million Demon Hunter Army will be like the fighting spirit of the fighting spirit Army, filled with an indomitable spirit!"The 9th Division commander frowned slightly."I have no objections. It's a tradition for a veteran to lead a new recruit!" It's just that ... The titles of both parties are different, and there are some differences ... To fully integrate, some military reforms are needed ..."Those revived Masters were all undying, how should they be arranged?How would the eighth division commander and the other powerhouses settle down?As for Silver moon's military governors and Huang Yu, who was the Commander-in-Chief of the three armies, what would happen?And what about himself?He could understand why Li Hao wanted to merge the heaven battling Army with the Demon Hunter Army. Their current systems were still different, and there were still some issues of interests.Heaven battling city was now almost completely under Li Hao's control.Since they couldn't resist ... Then they had to fight for the interests of these new martial artists."I'll integrate into the grassroots first. I'll still need to concentrate the high-level combat power for now!""The enemies we have now are mostly strong," Li Hao said."So, we don't need to worry too much about this for now."At this time, the quiet and low-profile Empress Dowager Shui Yun suddenly said,""Lord Marquis, now that the great wilderness has surrendered, even though the million elites can't compare to the Demon Hunter Army, they're still an elite force. How should we settle them down?"Her watercloud Army had now become a Navy, and the four Seas might be filled up ... In fact, even though it was called the vast wilderness, it was also a way to Scout for the future of her watercloud Army.Li Hao fell into deep thought. After a while, he said,""The great wilderness cavalry is the main force. At present, the divine Kingdom's elites have all been lost. The great wilderness has reduced its Army by 500000, leaving about 300000 behind ... To defend the divine Kingdom in the West!"The great wilderness wasn't easy to arrange. Furthermore, he had previously promised the great desolate King that he would make some proper arrangements for the great wilderness.He then looked at Empress Dowager Shui Yun and said,""If the four Seas are filled up, the raincloud Army won't move. They'll only be moved from the five continents to the periphery of the haoxing continent to defend! In addition ... Go to the R & D department and let them see if they can build some powerful warships!"
