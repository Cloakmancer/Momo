The three of them were fighting over Time and Stars and were still entangled in the void Dao universe.Li Hao was also comprehending various sword essences at this moment.In an instant, the huge Silver Moon became extremely quiet. There was no battle. The world was peaceful and prosperous!……This peaceful and prosperous world was not the result that everyone wanted.The world was at peace, there were no battles, and no opportunities to speak of.In the small world of the Silver Moon, Li Hao had mastered the truth path, li daoheng had mastered The Phantom path, the Stargate and the boundary wall were controlled by the red moon Emperor, and the Li Dynasty still had an extremely powerful God of beginner martial arts.In this world ... There seemed to be no place for opportunities. For ordinary cultivators, it was enough as long as they had enough energy.However, for Saints and those above ... Silver moon's lands of opportunity had already been occupied. If they did not join these factions, there was almost no hope of advancing further.……Silver Moon land.One of them leaned against the wall of the cave and sighed. "It's said that with the blessing of heaven's will, one can become the Son of heaven's will and control the world ... But now, with all the powerhouses fighting for hegemony, all opportunities are locked. Even with the blessing of heaven's will, there seems to be no opportunity to speak of ..." Then, with a self-deprecating tone, he said softly,""Heaven's will, aren't you the ruler of the Silver Moon? But now it seems that ... You are nothing and can't fight against those people. I thought that with the blessing of heaven's will, I could reach the top of the world in a Day, but ... The chosen one is still hiding here and there. "After obtaining the blessing of heaven's will, he had thought that this was the peak of his life.Who would have thought that it would become a death warrant!Li Hao's men were searching everywhere. Thanks to the blessing of heaven's will, they could still sense the situation. However, they were lucky enough not to see anything. They only knew that they were hiding everywhere and were not as free as they had been.This so-called 'Son of Heaven's mandate' was truly useless. There was no other way. Silver Moon ... Still had a few other 'fathers of heaven's mandate'!In this small world, the newly-born heaven's will seemed to be no match for this group of people. The only person who could have fought them was Li Hao ... But in the end, he was also a troublesome master and almost ate the Heaven's Will.The Heaven's Will had reached this stage ... He thought about what he had read in some books. The neo martial art heaven's will had transformed into a seed and controlled the heaven and earth at will. It was only in the end that it was defeated by the human King ... It was invincible.In comparison, Silver moon's heaven's will did not even seem to be qualified to be the final villain.What a tragedy!  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  As soon as the man's voice was heard, a wave of fluctuation was felt. The ground under his feet suddenly split open, and a small, newly-born energy mine vein appeared.The person who spoke seemed to have gotten used to it.He reached out and grabbed a large number of energy stones, but ... He still felt bitter.""What's the use? At this stage, would powerhouses still care about this measly amount of energy stones? I don't think there's anything good in the world!"There were still a few treasures in the world. To an ordinary person, even to the sun and moon level, they were considered treasures.However, to someone at the daomerge ... It wasn't anything too valuable.At that level, were these natural treasures of use?What was needed was Dao, comprehension, and all kinds of huge opportunities. Opportunities that could directly cross levels were not just some trivial things. There was no one else who could reach this stage in the Heaven's Will!At this moment, a weak energy fluctuation appeared in the body of the person who spoke, as if he was sending a message. The person's face changed slightly, and his eyes flickered."The Queen of the West? Was he reliable? I know a little about that person. He was scared out of his wits by Li Hao ... It seems that we've gained something this time, but ... Can we trust him?"He seemed to have communicated with heaven's will for a while, and he muttered to himself,""That Queen actually has the hope of replacing the real moon goddesses ... That's impressive!""Then ... I'll go and try?"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.Since heaven's will had said so, he might as well try his luck. While the world was at peace, Li Hao's experts were all cultivating and could move around freely. If Li Hao's battle ended, the world's experts would be in charge, and it would be difficult for them to move.……Silver City.The powerhouses were all cultivating in silence. The power of the great DAOs and the power of the Heavenly Kings were all overflowing.The outcome of the battle in the void Dao universe had yet to be decided. There was not much movement, and Li Hao could not sense anything.While Li Hao was still comprehending the sword essence, he suddenly opened his eyes.There was one more person beside him."Is there something?"It was Lin Hongyu.Lin Hongyu saw the sword will in his eyes and knew that he was still cultivating. However, she still came over to interrupt him and said,""There's something you need to decide on your own. ""Speak," he said.Lin Hongyu hesitated for a moment, but she still said,""Didn't the Queen of the West take some moon god fragments?"Li Hao nodded slightly.Lin Hongyu continued,"you were cultivating. She didn't dare to disturb you. She didn't have the guts to come and look for you either. The Queen said that she hoped to give you a piece of information in exchange for you not to deal with her.""What news?"“……”Lin Hongyu was speechless. If he knew, what was the point of trading?"She said that she's very important to you. She found out about it through the moon god fragment. If you're interested, we can contact her."Li Hao frowned slightly,'it's not a good thing to be too close to this person! This person was good at ruining things! Whoever is with her will be in trouble. "Lin Hongyu wanted to laugh, but she held it in.Li Hao, on the other hand, was very serious. Although he didn't believe that someone would be possessed by bad luck ... The Queen was indeed capable of doing so. Of course, it wasn't because she was unlucky, but because she was able to pass on her bad luck to the people around her.

Chapter 2401 Boundless Love!(3)
Wherever he went, he would die!Except for Zheng Yu, almost all of the people who had worked with her were dead.It was hard to say how many fragments the moon goddess, the real Moon Goddess, had left.In any case, Li Hao didn't believe in fate, but this person ... Was really unlucky.What news could she have sent him?Even if it was really transmitted, it couldn't be believed. If it was believed, it would be troublesome!He was about to refuse, but after a moment of silence, he suddenly said,""Tell her to come see me! I won't argue with her about the moon god fragment. After all, she also took part in the battle against a Heavenly King ... Although I don't need it!""Alright!"Lin Hongyu responded. Seeing that Li Hao didn't want to talk anymore, she couldn't help but say,""There are only three powerful enemies left now. We're only at the early-stage Dao integration realm, so I'm afraid we won't be of much help to you. However, we'll always be your backup ..."Li Hao looked at her in confusion. Why did her words sound so ... Awkward?What was this woman trying to say?Lin Hongyu saw his confused look and felt a little helpless. She turned around and left. "It's fine now. You can continue your cultivation!"Li Hao glanced at her and didn't say anything.When he was far away, he seemed to have realized something and laughed.It was really awkward!He shook his head and did not bother about it. He continued to comprehend the various sword intents. At the same time, he paid attention to the situation in the void Dao universe. He was not afraid of Zheng Yu and Li daoheng appearing, but he was worried that the clone of Red Moon venerable Emperor would be released by the two of them!It wasn't to break the seal, but to kill him.He had stayed in the Silver City all this time to kill off the evil thoughts of these two people. If the red moon Emperor's clone really appeared, whether it would kill him or destroy the eight major cities and release his original body ... Those two guys knew very well in their hearts. This would also kill their thoughts of killing him through the venerable sovereign's avatar.As he thought about this, he also considered what he would say in the future.Half-Emperor strength!A thousand sword essences!In the future, he might encounter a crisis while he was still a half-step Emperor, provided that the future didn't change. There were only three people who could kill him, and a half-step Emperor shouldn't have broken through the Stargate and left the Silver Moon.So ... If this crisis really appeared, there was a high probability that he would be in a state of momentary loss of strength when dealing with those three people with all his strength.When he thought about his future self, it seemed that he had gone through too much vicissitudes ... It was either many years later, or it was caused by excessive use of the power of time!Many years later, the possibility was not high.It was more likely that he had overused the power of time, making him look particularly old. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been so old.He kept thinking about that shadow, his future self.Even though this was only one of the many possibilities, Silver moon's current situation was one of those few. His future self had not told him anything about the future.He didn't even say who killed him.In fact, Li Hao understood that he was worried that he would make a wrong judgment. For example, if he told himself that he would be killed by the red moon Emperor, something might go wrong and Zheng Yu and the others could take advantage of him.Only then did he understand himself! He knew that the reason why his future self didn't say anything was because of this. He didn't want to interfere with his current judgment."The future can be changed ... But losing power once is inevitable. Only during the half-step sovereign realm can I make up for the power I borrowed ... And it must be at the peak of my battle intent ..."Li Hao was thinking about how to deal with this crisis.Where there are gains, there are losses!This time, he had to return the power he had borrowed from the future. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  All sorts of thoughts appeared in his mind once more.After thinking for a while, he sensed a special power. It was the power of the Silver Moon.The Queen was here!……Outside.The Queen was actually a little nervous and unwilling to see Li Hao, but she also knew that Li Hao was the most powerful person in the world. Even if she seemed to be stronger than before, she still felt that going against Li Hao would not end well.Didn't someone like Ying Hongyue get killed as well?They all thought that he wouldn't die!It was related to the seal of the venerable sovereign, but in the end, he was still killed.Now, everyone felt that the moon goddesses would not die, and they would not die either. This was because the Silver Moon was the core power of the Silver Moon world. Once the Silver Moon was completely destroyed, it might cause a huge disaster.But ... In this day and age, who could say for sure?So, she still came."Your Majesty!"Lin Hongyu and the others rose into the air to welcome the Queen.The Queen's expression was cold and she didn't want to talk to them. She wasn't afraid of these people."Where's the Silver Moon Marchioness?""The Marquis is waiting for His Majesty in the city!"The Queen didn't say anything. It was just a procedure. She had sensed Li Hao's sword intent long ago. She followed the others and landed on the ground, walking toward Li Hao.……In the yuan family's courtyard.The Queen strode in, and Li Hao's voice was heard.""The rest of you, go do your own things!"Everyone left, leaving the Queen alone, feeling uneasy as she walked into the room.The courtyard door opened.Li Hao sat on the chair, very relaxed. He nodded slightly at her."Have a seat!"The Queen replied coldly,"no need!" Li Hao, I'm not afraid of you. You're only at the fifth level of the Dao integration realm, the mid-stage Heavenly King realm ... I've also reached the mid-stage Heavenly King realm, and I'm about to reach the late-stage ..."

2402 Chapter 401
Li Hao looked at her in surprise and calmly said,""And then? You want to kill me?""...No!"The Queen was in pain. Who said I'm going to kill you?I just want you to be afraid!I'm not to be trifled with either!"There's a traitor by your side," she said directly."He's Li daoheng's pawn. I've learned a little through the moon god fragment. As long as you promise not to cause me any more trouble, I'll tell you who he is!"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao chuckled."I'm not interested in making trouble for you. Also, did you learn something from the moon god fragment?"Li Hao directly treated it as a joke!The Queen, however, was extremely serious,"that's right!" And it was someone you didn't dare to believe! All of this is in the moon god's core. This time, she was severely damaged and almost completely destroyed, so I took the core secret!"Li Hao had already guessed that this woman had some secret to trade with him.Now that he heard it, it was not too unexpected. "Tell me, who is it?" he smiled."You ...""I agree to your request."The Queen was a little uneasy when she saw him agree so easily. However, at this point, it would be more troublesome if he didn't say anything. She gritted her teeth and said in a deep voice,""Li daoheng isn't just one chess piece, one in the light and one in the dark! On the surface, he is a cultivator under your command called sword! And the true core ... Is not him, but the earth overturning sword!"The Queen's expression was a little heavy,"the earth overturning sword, ever-changing, one sword turning into ten thousand swords!" This is the chess piece that li daoheng has always placed by your side! Since a long time ago, li daoheng had been planning this. You had the starry sky sword, so he couldn't just ignore it. Thus ... The moment you stepped onto the martial path, someone was already by your side, and that person was the earth overturning sword!"As she said this, she was also a little excited. This was a very important piece of news, and she felt that Li Hao's trade with her was the right decision."This King also knows that the Earthcover sword is one of the few people you value! But think about it, how many people have been following you since the beginning? And how many of them were good at swordsmanship? Who else is powerful, ever-changing, and similar to the sword of the revered sword artist?"The more she spoke, the more excited she became,"now, do you understand the importance of the news I'm bringing you?" If the earth overturning sword betrays you at the crucial moment, you'll be in trouble! This person seems to occupy an extremely important part of your Dao universe ... Once he seizes control of the Dao universe, you'll definitely die. I didn't want to tell you this this time, but I don't want li daoheng to succeed either!"She looked at Li Hao, as if hoping to see Li Hao break down in despair and even stomp his feet.However, Li Hao seemed to be very calm. It was as if ... He didn't hear it?The Queen frowned.Pretending to be profound?Or was this news too much of a blow to Li Hao, and he couldn't accept it?Li Hao held his teacup and took a sip of wine. His teacup was rarely filled with tea, and was mostly filled with wine.After drinking a few mouthfuls, he said calmly,""This is the information extracted from the core of the moon god fragment?""Right!"The Queen nodded and said sternly,"this King would never lie to you. Furthermore ... It was extremely well hidden. There was only a trace of spiritual energy left. Fortunately, I acted quickly. Otherwise, it would have completely dissipated. In the end, I still managed to capture such important information!"The earth overturning sword!She knew that this person was very important. Dao Jian had joined later and wasn't very eye-catching in the camp. She felt that Li Hao should be on guard.However, overpowered sword, the person who had been following him, was the real chess piece ... Li Hao probably didn't know that.The Queen herself had also made her own judgment ... And felt that li daoheng was the one who had planted the Earthcover sword.After all, he had abandoned the child sword of the starry sky sword, so he definitely needed someone to guide Li Hao, or even monitor everything about Li Hao. Who was more suitable than the Earthcover sword?The overseer sword had indeed helped Li Hao a lot in his journey to this day.Seeing that Li Hao still didn't say anything, she continued,""I've already told you, and it's the truth that you can't accept it! I know a little about Hong Yitang. He's not normal to begin with. You've just been negligent! Your master challenged him many times, but he rejected all of them. In the end, he followed you so easily. This doesn't match his character! Moreover, he's not related to you at all, but he's always been helping you ... You've been in danger many times, and he's always been the one to help you solve it. At that time, your master hadn't broken the restriction yet!""Only li daoheng doesn't wish for you to die too early. When you discover the new Dao universe, you will have achieved li daoheng's goal! Also, don't you think that the earth overturning sword's lack of desire is too much? Since I don't have any desires, why should I help you? It's also contrary to his forbearance in the early stages!"The Queen was a little pleased with herself."I've also managed the world and countless people before! "I even know that his wife is trying to win over the hearts of the people in the divine Kingdom. You have to understand that the divine Kingdom has always been my territory, as well as the territory of the moon goddess and Li daoheng. At this moment, winning over the hearts of the people in the divine Kingdom will actually be very useful at a critical moment. Even ... With the faith of the people, Hong Xiu can become the moon goddess!""I actually have another guess. This Hong Xiu may be a part of the moon goddess! The moon goddess is heavily injured, but she's still alive. If you let your guard down now, perhaps the number one God of the Silver Moon clan will surprise you at a critical moment!"

2403 Chapter 401
At this moment, the Queen seemed to have transformed into the god of wisdom.Some of this was what she had seen, while some was what she had guessed. She wasn't stupid, and after some speculation, she felt that her thoughts were completely in line with li daoheng's plans.Hong Xiu had gone to the West to make preparations to strengthen the moon god again at a critical moment. Although the faith in the moon god had collapsed a little, the foundation of faith was still there. As long as Hong Xiu replaced the moon god in her current identity at a critical moment, it would be too easy to gather faith again for such a figure who had saved countless children and widows!"There's one more thing, heaven's will!"The Queen smiled confidently again."Hong Xiu has always been doing good. It's reasonable for her to be blessed by heaven's will!" If she was the incarnation of the moon goddess, they had always wanted to capture the Heaven's Will. But now, the Heaven's Will had walked right into their trap and fallen into her hands! This was brilliant! Under your eyes, he obtained the blessing of heaven's will and even captured it ... With the help of heaven's will and Silvermoon's true body ... Perhaps li daoheng will be able to quickly walk out and become the first half-step sovereign to walk out of the restriction!""At that time ... You'll be attacked from both the inside and the outside. You'll be dead!"The Queen was extremely confident."Li Hao, I saved your life this time. I told you the enemy's plot in advance. You owe me your life!"“……”Li Hao just looked at her without saying anything.Was there a problem with the Queen's deduction?Logically speaking, there was no problem at all. According to her, Hong Xiu was the incarnation of the moon goddess when she plotted to seize the Heaven's Will. At the critical moment, she revived the moon goddess again and even seized the Heaven's Will. It was reasonable for her strength to improve further.As for Earthcover sword ... Its intent of 10000 swords was indeed extremely mysterious. It was a special divine text second only to the divine text of the word "Dao". It could even control and change 10000 DAOs. Once Li Hao's divine text of the word "Dao" collapsed, he might really be controlled by Earthcover sword.From these two aspects ... This setup was too brilliant!If Li Hao had guessed it himself ... He would have been surprised, or even dejected.But ... Since it came from the Queen's mouth, he didn't have much of a reaction. He only looked at the Queen silently for a while, and after a long time, he said,""You're so lucky and powerful. You've managed to pry into all these secrets!""Of course!"The Queen laughed."If I'm not lucky," she said,"would I have lived to this day?"She really ... Didn't have any self-awareness at all!"Alright, I got it.""What are you going to do?""It has nothing to do with you! You can leave now!"“……”The Queen was stunned for a moment. He was too impolite.This was a little different from what she had expected.In her opinion, she had exposed li daoheng's most crucial scheme for Li Hao ... Li Hao wouldn't shed tears of gratitude, nor would he have such a cold attitude.What do you mean it has nothing to do with me?  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Li Hao, this King knows that you are very confident and think that everyone in the world is under your control, but this King also has to tell you ... Too much confidence will lead to a miserable death! You'd better get rid of these people right now ... Otherwise, you'll suffer a backlash!""Alright, you can go now!"“……” "Li Hao ..."The Queen was a little angry. Is this how you treat your benefactor?I told you such a secret, but I could have kept it a secret and let you fall into someone's trap!Li Hao's head hurt. He waved his hand impatiently. "Don't shout, get out! Immediately! Also, I know about this matter. Now, I promise you that I won't find trouble with you again. Just stay away from me!"The Queen's face turned ashen!Bastard!I've told you such an important secret with good intentions and risked offending li daoheng and yueshen, and you're showing me this attitude?Very good!Since that's the case ... If you want to die, then just die!She didn't say anything more and turned to leave. She snorted coldly."If you don't care and don't believe me, then don't blame me."…… After she left, Li Hao exhaled and smiled.This person seemed to be hoping to gain some recognition from me ... I don't dare to do that, it's too dangerous."Li daoheng...Moon Goddess ..."Recalling the Queen's words, Li Hao smiled again.It was reasonable!Others might not know that he had obtained the starry sky sword, but li daoheng must have been observing him all this while. Even his clan was his test subject. Someone must have checked the results of the experiment. From this point of view, the Earthcover sword was very suitable for this character!He had guided him to the path of the sword, and the first time they had met, he had imparted some of the true meaning of the sword Dao to him ... It had to be said that with that special 'sword' text, the other party was one of li daoheng's clones, and he was perfect!He trusted her so much that he even absorbed the earth overturning sword's star called bed into the river of chaos. Other than the earth overturning sword, only Lin Hongyu's star was also in his river of chaos, undergoing the baptism of ten thousand Dao.Now that Li Hao was in trouble, both of them had a chance of controlling the river of chaos.As for the earth overturning sword, he had a greater chance.This was because his Dao of the sword was very much in line with the true meaning of the entire great Dao.When the stars of the great path were arranged, they would form a sword."But ... I don't believe it!"Li Hao mumbled,"whether the Queen really caught the information by accident or you deliberately made me not suspect you ... I'll satisfy you and not suspect you. What can you do?"Was li daoheng the kind of person who would easily reveal his plans to others?Even if everything seemed to make sense, it wouldn't do!

Li Hao chuckled and suddenly said,""Martial uncle Hong, come over here!"Soon, Hong Yitang arrived.…… At this moment, Li Hao was still calm. He sized her up and said,""The Queen came and said that you are li daoheng's clone. Martial uncle, is that right?"“……”Hong Yitang's eyes flickered as he glanced at Li Hao."She also said that martial uncle Hong Xiu was the incarnation of the moon goddess ... She was traveling in the West to gather the power of faith so that she could recover instantly at the critical moment. What do you think?"“……”Hong Yitang was stunned for a moment. Then, Li Hao said,""She also said that you've been monitoring me from the beginning, and your sword text is a substitute for Dao text. Once Dao text disappears, you'll be the next person to control the great Dao. Does martial uncle think ... There's something wrong with that?"“……”Hong Yitang felt bitter. He thought carefully and said after a while,""Perfect! According to what she said, I ... Am indeed the biggest suspect! In fact ... Other than me, there doesn't seem to be a second person more suitable to be the chess piece that li daoheng placed at your side!"As he listened, he seemed to believe it and could not refute anything.Hong Yitang was helpless,'if I don't explain, then I admit it! My defense ... Doesn't seem ... Appropriate?""What do you say?" he looked at Li Hao.Then, he smiled bitterly."If you trust me, you won't doubt me. But if I really am, this doesn't seem right. It seems ... Very troublesome!"Li Hao nodded."It's very troublesome! Thus ... I thought about it. The Empress's words are actually very uncomfortable ... I thought about it, martial uncle, since that's the case, how about this, in order for you to successfully merge the two Dao universes, I'll give you the truth Dao universe!""You still chose to believe her ..." Hong Yitang sighed. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 It was a very helpless thing.Li Hao shook his head."No, I'm serious. I'll give you the Dao universe!"“……”Hong Yitang was stunned. Li Hao looked at him again and said, I said, I'll give the Dao universe to you, uncle-master! I've thought about it ... Too much of the great Dao universe has been exposed recently. The river of chaos and everything else have been exposed!"Li Hao sighed, I have no Trump cards to speak of now! Everything is being watched by others ... So, after thinking for a long time, I've decided to leave the river of chaos behind and let martial uncle control it! I have to jump out again!"Li Hao chuckled."Martial uncle, whether you're the real li daoheng's clone or not, it doesn't matter. If you're real, I'll fulfill your wish. If you're fake, I'll fulfill your wish even more!" The universe of the sword Dao naturally needs a swordsman to control it. The ever-changing sword text is actually more suitable for this great Dao universe than me!"Hong Yitang's expression changed. He looked at Li Hao with a heavy heart!Was this trust, distrust, a test, or was Li Hao completely crazy?Li Hao, who had just advanced to the fifth level of the Dao integration realm and schemed against a few experts, actually wanted to withdraw from the Dao universe ... What was he thinking?Li Hao smiled,"uncle-master, don't be surprised!" When I said I'm quitting, I didn't mean completely quitting! I want to take some things away and leave some things behind ... In addition, even if it's the Dao universe, I don't need anything else, but I want that star!"The heart of the great Dao!Without that thing, this Dao universe was actually no different from an ordinary Dao universe. It was the same as the origin, not much different.Hong Yitang's expression changed,"what are you talking about?" What was he thinking? At this moment, everyone is placing their hopes on you. What are you thinking? You're now at the fifth level of the Dao integration realm, and the new martial sages have all fused with the Dao. You should be able to reach the sixth level of the Dao integration realm very soon and become the most powerful being below the half-step sovereign realm ...""Actually, uncle-master can do it too!" Li Hao said softly."You ...""Uncle-master," Li Hao said seriously,"let's put it this way. I need ... Someone to be my backer. At critical moments, they can give me a hand! I've absorbed the future self, so I'm bound to face a crisis in the future. And this time, no one can save me from this crisis! The people around me aren't strong enough. Only uncle-master, if you control the great Dao universe, there's a high chance ... You can play a huge role!"Hong Yitang's expression was a bit ugly. Li Hao said,""Uncle-master has always been patient, and he's used to it. So ... No matter how fast uncle-master's strength improves, we can't reveal anything! Since li daoheng wants me to suspect martial uncle and get rid of him ... I've thought about it for a long time. Why don't I make martial uncle even more terrifying!""If you're really li daoheng's clone ..." Li Hao laughed,"I don't think I'll Miss Silver Moon too much. I might as well fulfill your wish and return martial uncle's favor for helping me in the past! If not ... Then I've won the bet, and martial uncle can become my right hand at the critical moment!""I was thinking about this from the start ... Today, when the Queen came and told me ... My thoughts have been confirmed!"Hong Yitang's expression changed completely,'are you serious? You're not testing me?""No.""You're crazy!"At this moment, Hong Yitang was a little crazy."Are you completely crazy? It wasn't easy for you to develop the Dao universe to its current state. All the People's cultivators believe in you, Li Hao. If you give up now ... What will you do? What should everyone do? What about Silver Moon?"

"I'm not giving up!"Li Hao shook his head."I didn't say that I'm giving up. I just said that I'm giving up control of the Dao universe for the time being. I want to ... Open my heaven!""What?"Li Hao laughed,"whether it's the truth path or The Phantom path, I can't successfully merge them now!" I can't do anything to that guy, and that guy can't control me easily ... We both have a headache! Since that's the case, I'll simulate the fusion of truth path and Phantom path, plus the small stars of time star ..."Li Hao's smile became more and more brilliant.I have both!'I have the truth Dao stars, I also have The Phantom Dao stars that I created, and I also have the core of the time sword, the time stars. Although they are all small, I constructed, created, and cultivated them bit by bit!How about creating a true fusion of the great Dao universe in his body?Of course, it was very dangerous!But ... Everything is mine! "From the beginning to the end, it's mine. If I can't go to the chaos to open the sky, then I'll use myself to open the heaven and earth again, open the great Dao universe again. How about it?This was an extremely crazy idea!However, Li Hao was tempted.I have this Foundation!No one has a better foundation than me. The structure of the spiritual universe can be said to be a stroke of genius, making up for the shortcomings of the void Dao universe.This was simply a heaven-sent opportunity!I want to truly ... Open up a world that belongs to me, even a Dao universe!“……”Hong Yitang was stunned. For a moment, he forgot to speak and forgot everything.Is this really the Li Hao I know?He never seemed to care about the things that everyone cared about!The great path universe, the Silver Moon world, the great path, the sword mind of the sword Master ...He didn't seem to care!Do you guys want it?Alright, I'll give it to you!I ... I'm just myself!I will only cultivate myself!At this moment, he didn't know what to say. For a moment, he was even somewhat frozen, and his throat was a little dry."You ... Are you serious?"Li Hao nodded and smiled brightly, martial uncle, a swordsman should walk his own path of the sword! Besides, I'm not just a swordsman. I've said it before, I'm a Daoist master! I hope that everyone will address me as Dao master, but Dao master ... Everything was obtained by taking advantage of others. What kind of Dao master is this?"Li Hao's smile was brilliant,"I know it's difficult, and I'm also very arrogant ... Even haughty!" But I want to try!""Capable of what others can 't!""Jumping out of this chessboard, you care, I don't care. You care, I don't care! I don't want the Li family bloodline or the eight great families bloodline! What great Dao universe, what Silvermoon world ... What you left behind, what you don't care about, I don't care! I'm not the sword Saint, the human King, or the blood Emperor ... But I'm not as strong as them. I want to surpass them in terms of mentality!"At this moment, Li Hao's smile was extremely bright.""Everyone thinks that my success lies in the Li family bloodline and the great Dao universe ... I'll give up on all of this. From now on, I'll live my own life! Uncle-master, do you think ... It's okay?"Hong Yitang was dumbfounded. He seemed to be shocked!Was this Li Hao, who had just turned 21 and had yet to officially turn 22? He said ... He would only live as himself!Li Hao smiled shyly."Of course, I'm just boasting. In fact, I still need to borrow the benefits left behind by some seniors. For example ... The great Dao universe left behind by the sword venerable. I want to ... Take away Time and Stars!" I also want to learn the true meaning of their great DAOs ... I'll first imitate them, then match them, and finally ... Surpass them!"Li Hao suddenly sat up straight and said with a smile,""In addition, I'd like to ask martial uncle not to act rashly. My master's and the others" Natal stars might still be inside ... I still have to resurrect them! Please don't let anything go wrong ... Martial uncle, do you think that's okay?"“……”Hong Yitang was shocked for a long time and swallowed his saliva.""Do you think there's a possibility that I'm really li daoheng's clone? but I don't know ... You gave me your Dao universe, and I ...""Then you'll live your life!"Li Hao raised his fist and smiled brightly like a child.""Take the blood Emperor for example. Everyone says that he is the reincarnation of Zhan Tiandi, but he has become himself! If you're really li daoheng's clone, and you don't know it yourself, then you'll live like a Hong Yitang! You already control half of the Dao universe, so why are you still afraid of him? If you kill him, you can call yourself Hong Yitang or li daoheng. I have no objections!""As for the Li clan's massacre, that was li daoheng's doing. What does it have to do with you?"Li Hao chuckled,"is it important whether it's a clone or not?" The important thing is, in my heart, you are Hong Yitang, the earth overturning sword, the martial uncle who guided my sword path. It is good if you are really a clone, when he wants to merge, give him a vicious attack and take his void path universe, the bed universe will be yours, I have no other requests, just revive my master and the rest! I'm going to build my own universe!"“……”Hong Yitang felt like he was struck by lightning!What was Li Hao saying? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Even if you're his avatar, it doesn't matter. I don't care. It's fine as long as you live as yourself or as Hong Yitang. I don't want the great Dao universe. I'll give it to you ... To repay your kindness in the past!This ... What exactly was this?"Li Hao ... Do you really not have any feelings?"He mumbled. Was this amorous?No, this was merciless!He didn't care about these things. He didn't seem to care about any of these things. He only cared about the things he cared about. Other than these, he seemed to be able to give up everything.How terrifying!He suddenly felt that the Li Hao in front of him was so terrifying ... That he should be called the demonic sword!The demonic sword Li Hao!With a shy expression, Li Hao suddenly took out a flag and showed it off.""Uncle-master, don't accuse me wrongly. I, Li Hao, have won the approval of countless people. Look, What is this?""Helpful and open-minded, I'll give you this: Patrol inspector Li Hao of the inspection Division. "Hong Yitang looked on in a daze. What ... Was this?There was also a sense of old age, where did it come from?"Back then, when I was working at the inspection Office, the commoners gave me ..."Li Hao's smile was brilliant."Sure enough, everyone knows that I'm a generous and helpful person. A few days ago, I thought that I had lost it. I went to the site of the inspection Office, but it was still there. So, I brought it back."艹!Who's blind?Hong Yitang was completely speechless!More importantly, Li Hao was actually found. This ... You're really ... Speechless.Li Hao chuckled. At this moment, he touched the sword in his hand and looked at Hong Yitang ... I'm going to open my little universe. I'm so happy. Only then can I completely jump out of here!I, Li Hao, have never been weaker than anyone. If you don't want it, I don't want it either!Hmph!

2406 Chapter 402
At this moment, Hong Yitang's feelings were complicated and no one could understand it.Li Hao said to give up the Dao universe.Li Hao had said,"so what if you're li daoheng's clone?"You have saved me and taught me. You are Hong Yitang, the earth-overturning sword. Even if you are a clone, you have to live for yourself and for Hong Yitang!Schemes and conspiracies ... They didn't seem to be worth mentioning in Li Hao's eyes.You want to defeat me?You want to use this to make me lose my mind?Are you trying to drive a wedge between us?It didn't matter!I'm not picking it up!Aren't you doing all this for the great Dao universe, the Silvermoon world, and the position of a venerable sovereign?If you want it, I'll give it to you!"I will fight for what I want and get it myself.Kill the person I want to kill at all costs.I love the person I love at all costs.At this moment, Hong Yitang's soul was greatly shocked. This was Li Hao, the ignorant kid from the past. In fact, he had only been around for a year.But ... Why did it feel like a century had passed?When Li Hao took out the pennant, he wanted to laugh, but his laugh was a little complicated. Are you telling me that you're still the same Li Hao?The past was like smoke.One scene after another appeared in his mind.Recalling the past, Hong Yitang's feelings were extremely complicated. He chuckled and suddenly said,""Just like you said, even I think that I might really be their spy. Whether it's a clone or something else ... I doubt myself!"He laughed at himself."However ... It's just as you said. I am the earth overturning sword. I am Hong Yitang!"He looked at Li Hao."Since you've made your decision and have your own thoughts and choices, I'll accept the Dao universe!" If one day, as you say, li daoheng really wants to take me away ... I'll live like Hong Yitang, like the overbearing sword! Live to ... Become a Silver Moon Martial Master!"At this moment, he straightened his back and looked at Li Hao."This is my promise! I don't know if I am ... But just as the Queen said, who else is more suitable than me in this world? Yuan Shuo is dead, and now, I'm the closest person to you. Since that's the case ... I'll tell you that I'll always be Hong Yitang!"Why did the Queen come?Was the moon goddess so careless that she left behind some memories for the Queen to learn?Perhaps this was li daoheng's scheme.Perhaps everything was fake, and there was no such thing. But as long as Li Hao tried to guess and think about it, he would be worried, create estrangement, and even suffer a critical blow to his heart.Hong Yitang was currently the closest person to Li Hao. He had protected and guided Li Hao from Silver Moon all the way.If he didn't doubt or think about it ... What if it was true?This was a mental interrogation. But perhaps li daoheng didn't expect that Li Hao didn't take this attack. He relaxed and happily gave up the universe of the great path, the land of treasures that countless people and even venerable sovereigns were envious of.Isn't this what you want?I'll give it to you!It doesn't matter if it's a clone or not ... I'll give it to you.In anyone's opinion, the universe of the great path was Li Hao's greatest and most important Foundation. It could not and could not be abandoned.However, in Li Hao's opinion ... A trump card that was known to others was no longer a trump card.He had been like this since the beginning.It had never changed!He jumped out ... He jumped out step by step. Only by jumping out of this chessboard would he be able to escape from all of this. Only then would he be able to break everyone's plans. He had never treated the people of the Silvermoon world as his lifelong enemy!Perhaps, these people were the obstacles on his way forward. They were very powerful and terrifying.However, psychologically, Li Hao looked down on these people.Seek Dao, why not seek Dao properly?Why did he seek the Dao like this?Proving the way of a venerable sovereign ... There was a way for new martial arts!After passing the Great Tribulation and becoming a venerable sovereign, it was just a small world. If the neo martial artist was strong, he could naturally attack other worlds. If he wanted the great Dao universe, he could attack the Crimson Moon world. As long as he was strong enough and dared to fight ... The Crimson Moon also had a great Dao universe, so there was no place for him?Even if Hong Yue didn't ... He would kill, take, and take again!If they had the time to plan, perhaps li daoheng and the others would have already become emperors!In terms of strength, he wasn't as good as them, but Li Hao had always felt that they weren't as carefree as him, the Silver Moon Martial Master!A hundred thousand years was too long.Such a long time ... No matter how many years had passed in the outside world, it was a real one hundred thousand years here. Such a long time, just waiting to harvest something that others didn't want ... How could he surpass his predecessors?What was the point of cultivating if the later generations were inferior to the Ancient Ones?The later generations cultivated and stood on the shoulders of giants. The predecessors paved the way, and the later generations should walk further. If the later generations only sought the legacy of the predecessors, wasn't this a kind of regression?He remembered what the seventh commander had told him back in heaven battling city. As long as he didn't die, he would do whatever he could!p The human King and the others were like this!Therefore, the human King and the others had gone far and high. This was the real neo martial.If he didn't torment and stick to the rules, how could he transcend? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Wasn't life just a struggle?Li Hao's target had always been these people. They were human Kings, supreme beings, sword Venerables, blood emperors ... These people would take, Rob, and seize whatever they wanted ... They did not plan for 100000 years and wait for others to abandon it. This was what the celestial Thearch and the others did. They were the losers of neo martial arts!He did not understand. Why did these people still want to learn from the celestial Emperor and the others even though they knew that the neo martial Celestial Emperor had failed?

2407 Chapter 402
Didn't he learn from his mistakes?……At this moment, hearing Hong Yitang's firm words, Li Hao smiled naughtily, as if he was trying to find his old self and comfort the middle-aged man in front of him.""Martial uncle, what's there to promise? it's fine as long as you live your own life! As long as you don't do evil...You can live however you want. You don't need to bear any responsibility or burden. As long as you don't do anything evil, you're a good person. "He looked into the distance, towards the North, and smiled.""Take the one in the North for example. Based on my understanding, many people might hate him, and even think that he's just an empty venerable sovereign ... But in my opinion, he should live his own life. He didn't do anything evil. As long as you don't provoke him, and he doesn't provoke you, it's enough that he's willing to spend time to do certain things!" n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Many people might look down on the one in the North, but in Li Hao's opinion ... It was fine as long as he was living a comfortable life. He didn't want to participate, so why did he have to?If it weren't for the fact that this person was too strong and was the key to victory, Li Hao wouldn't have been willing to harass him.But the reality was ... He had no choice but to play some tricks. Li Hao knew that this was actually very annoying. If he lived in seclusion, people would always harass him and hope that he would protect them. He would be very troubled, wouldn't he?He revealed a smile and looked at Hong Yitang.""Let's not talk about this anymore. This time, I'll just secretly hand over the task to martial uncle! Only you and I know ... Don't let anyone else know!""Just in case ... In case uncle-master is really the other party's clone, and the other party might even be able to monitor uncle-master ..."Li Hao looked at Hong Yitang and said,'from now on, uncle-master, seal your self-consciousness in the river of chaos! Wrap yourself in the river of chaos and isolate yourself from the heavens and earth!"Li Hao said softly,"I'll announce to the public that you're in seclusion. Whether they think that I killed you or imprisoned you, they can guess whatever they want!" There are quite a few daomerge cultivators in the world now, and in a year's time, education has been put on the right track. Martial uncle, it just so happens that you can spend some time to study the Dao of the sword!" Li Hao continued, martial uncle knows the way of the sword better than I do! I actually don't understand the way of the sword ..."A top-notch swordsman said that he didn't understand sword principle.Hong Yitang was slightly stunned.Li Hao, however, was very serious."I don't understand the way of the sword. What I understand is the application of Dao ... In my opinion, be it the sword or the saber, any Dao only seeks two points. First, longevity! Second, be strong!"Longevity was powerful!Hong Yitang looked at Li Hao in surprise. Li Hao seemed to be explaining the nature of his Dao. He said very seriously,""Cultivation of the Dao, cultivation of the heart! The essence of Dao was to strengthen oneself. What was the point of strengthening oneself? Seeking immortality! And to live forever ... One had to be powerful. It was a cycle! This process is the process of cultivating one's heart. It doesn't matter if you're a good person or a bad person ... As long as you have a firm belief, that's the heart!""Longevity and strength are the results. Mental cultivation was a process. But the sword, saber, and spear are all one appearance...This is actually not important. ""The road ahead is long. Search up and down, know your goal, firm your faith ... And not aimless. In this way, you will succeed one day!"Hong Yitang was shocked. He looked at Li Hao and said in a low voice,""Then what is your goal?""Searching!" Li Hao smiled.Hong Yitang was stunned.Li Hao smiled and said,"uncle-master, don't you think that the great Dao is very interesting?" Cultivation was a form of pleasure! For example, the Shi at the beginning, then the divine text, then the Dao Meridian, then the great Dao universe, then the spirit Sea World, then the real Dao, the void Dao, the domain, the battle techniques ... Step by step, you explore, try and make mistakes, and start all over again ... Every time, it's a form of enjoyment, a form of pleasure, this is the joy of seeking!"Li Hao said with emotion, it's really interesting to verify some of my ideas and try them out with cultivation! For example, the splitting open of the sky, which is also a form of imitation, is definitely not the end!""The great Dao universe itself has it. I'm just trying to imitate the great Dao universe ... To open my heaven! Even if I succeed, that's definitely not the end. There must be a higher level, a more perfect Daoist magic!"Li Hao smiled."What the predecessors have said may not necessarily be right. What is born from heaven and earth may not necessarily be the most perfect ... However, on this basis, one can understand, perceive, do, and create new things ... Perhaps, the future generations can learn something from me, their predecessor.""Just like my master ..."Li Hao sighed with emotion at the mention of Yuan Shuo."My master created the secret technique of five birds on the basis of the predecessors, and the secret technique of five birds is actually one of the foundations that I have reached today ... The secret technique of five birds is a fusion of many things and a thorough understanding! If the master could create something like this, why couldn't the disciple? Moreover, I'm stronger than my master, I've seen more, I've comprehended more ... Even if I don't surpass others, I should at least surpass my master and be stronger than my master!"“……”"Yuan Shuo probably won't be happy!" Hong Yitang laughed.Li Hao also laughed."Maybe. My teacher always says that he's better than his teacher, but in fact, he's very conceited. He thinks that he's the most talented person in the world and that no one should be able to surpass him ... Unfortunately, he's too inexperienced and short-sighted!"

2408 Chapter 402
“……”Li Hao laughed and said,"has he ever seen the power of a Heavenly King?" Had he ever seen a half-step sovereign? Had he ever beaten a venerable sovereign? 'I've ... Experienced all of this!' "Thus, talent isn't the only thing that matters. The key is knowledge, experience, luck, opportunity, hard work, and then, with talent, you can go further."The two of them no longer talked about the great path universe, nor did they mention the matter of avatars.It was as if all of this was just a trivial matter.After chatting for a while, Li Hao suddenly said,""I'm still not fully prepared ... I need some time to prepare. During this time, you can go and see uncle Hong Xiu. The Queen's words may not necessarily be false!"Although he knew that the Queen was unreliable, the news she brought might not be fake. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Hong Yitang looked a bit serious, but Li Hao smiled and said,""There's no need to worry about anything! Whether it's a clone or the main body ... If you're really separated, you won't be you! Previously, when I used the chaos River as my main body to create an avatar, I discovered a flaw ... An avatar is also a human! With flesh and blood, with thoughts ... That was a living person! Don't try to create a clone ... Once the three era technique was used, I understood a principle-I'm the only one in all of eternity!""The future me is not me!""Perhaps, in the eyes of others, the future me is me, the past me is me, the present me is me, and the clone is me ... But in reality, I am not. There is only one me!" He said softly."Li daoheng and the others are so fond of clones ... This isn't a good habit! Of course, there aren't any major problems right now...But if you keep on creating clones, problems will arise sooner or later. As long as you create clones, you'll have some problems that you might not even be aware of. ""What?" Hong Yitang frowned slightly."You're saying ... Neo martial's clone technique is not a good thing?""Of course!"Li Hao nodded."I've read about it in the ancient books. How many neo martial Supreme emperors often split themselves?" Only the Zhang family's Supreme martial artist had split himself a few times in order to contribute more in his early years. People like the human King were all determined to only me! Can't they create clones? Of course he could! But why not? Couldn't the sword Saint have a clone? Of course, even in the North. Why couldn't venerable the sword? Why didn't you leave a clone here? as long as you left a clone, you could have killed a venerable sovereign with the eight trigrams Formation!"Moreover, it didn't affect him too much.Why didn't the sword Saint leave a clone behind?This was because the way of the sword venerable was the only one in the world and the only one in all DAOs.This was Li Hao's recent realization. He briefly mentioned it, but didn't go into detail. He said,"So, martial uncle Hong Xiu, even if it's really as the Queen said, and it's the moon goddess" clone ... It's fine! Kill the Moon goddess and everything will be over!"Kill yueshen?Hong Yitang's heart moved."She's not easy to kill. You didn't manage to kill her the previous few times! She's the core of the Silver Moon ... The heavens won't let her die ... In fact, she can be considered the true will of the heavens. " Yueshen was not easy to kill.Easy to kill, I've already killed him.Li Hao shook his head."No, I just don't want to kill her. I don't want to waste too much time on her. It's not difficult to kill her!" If she was the first-generation heaven's will, then what was in front of her was the second-generation heaven's will. She wanted to capture heaven's will as well ... But heaven's will was nothing! Uncle-master, it's easy to kill yueshen and Tianyi ..."Hong Yitang looked at Li Hao.Up until now, he still hadn't found the will of the heavens!Yueshen had also run into the void Dao universe and was untraceable, so how could he kill her?Seeing that Hong Yitang was looking forward to it, Li Hao roughly knew what he was thinking. Li Hao was worried that something might happen to his beloved disciple and wife, so he immediately smiled ambiguously. Hong Yitang was speechless."You also have a wife ... Although she's not married yet!" "I'm not embarrassed," Li Hao laughed."What's there to be embarrassed about, uncle?"“……”Li Hao said again, how about this, I'll create an opportunity for uncle-master! If I use my physical body to split open the sky, I might cause a huge commotion. I just so happen to need martial uncle to help me cover it up!""On the day I open the sky, uncle-master, you just need to do one thing ... Open the great Dao universe and devour the haoxing continent!"Hong Yitang was shocked!Li Hao continued,"I'll pull the carpet from the bottom of the pot. I'll directly absorb the billions of Silver Moon citizens into the great Dao universe!" A place with no one was still called heaven and earth? The Heaven's Will will will collapse. Be it the moon goddess or the Heaven's Will, they will definitely not allow this to happen. They might even take the opportunity to enter the universe of the great Dao!""If uncle-master Hong Xiu is really the moon god's avatar, this time, she will gather her faith again and gather her true body!""These two are the key figures. The third is the Queen. The Queen has taken too much of the Silver Moon's power ... Perhaps the moon god is just living in the Queen and trying to be like li daoheng, to become one with her clone!""Be it heaven's will or the moon goddesses ... They've all been influenced by people like li daoheng and like to have more than one clone ... Heaven's will may not be the only one, and neither may the moon goddesses ..."Li Hao pondered for a moment and said,'that day, when I opened the sky with my physical body, I might be able to draw out the stars of time! "This is also a very important point. If uncle-master can capture a part of them, I'll think of a way to use Time and Stars to go back to the past and the future ... I'll kill the Heaven's Will and the moon goddess! Only martial uncle Hong Xiu is left, and I am the only one in the world!""Once the Heaven's Will collapses, the heavens and earth will shake ... The great Dao will take this opportunity to invade the heavens and earth and gather the Heaven's Will again ... I am the Heaven's Will! This 'me'... Was referring to his martial uncle. With the Dao as the heavens ..."

2409 Chapter 402
Hong Yitang looked at him in a daze."You ... Is this the path you wanted to take?"Li Hao seemed to have already planned this.This path ... Seemed pretty good. Perhaps he had planned it this way before.Li Hao nodded slightly."That's right. But I had more choices later on. I didn't worry too much." This has its drawbacks as well. The Silver Moon is too deeply tied to me, and the responsibility is too great. I have to bear everything of the ten billion Silver Moon people ... I don't want to commit evil with such a heavy burden!"However, I don't want to be completely bound by the Silver Moon!He didn't finish his sentence, but Hong Yitang understood."Then, can a half-step sovereign walk out of the world?" Hong Yitang took a deep breath."It's possible!"Li Hao nodded."But if that day really comes ... I'll succeed in splitting open the sky, and I won't be afraid of them! It's fine if the half-step sovereigns come out ... Besides, they're in a very troublesome time now and might not have the time to find trouble with us!"Hearing his words, Hong Yitang nodded and didn't say anything else."Do you need anything else?" he asked after a while."I'm going to take away my 360 stars. Whether or not they've been opened, I'm going to take them away ... The river of chaos might be slightly weaker. Martial uncle will fill the void himself!""That's the first .... The second is that if Time and Stars appear, I might ... Trap them in my own universe .... Of course, that's only if they're willing. If they're not, it's difficult for me to do so. ""The third ..."Li Hao paused. After a long while, he said,"let's talk about the third after. I don't want to be tied down too much. But if ... Lin Hongyu is willing to leave, I might take her Natal star with me. We'll see how it goes in the future!"Hong Yitang chuckled and nodded. He didn't say anything else."From today onwards, uncle-master will try to use the text of the Dao of the sword to control the river! As for me, I'll slowly extract my Natal star and leave ... Martial uncle, just follow the plan and don't worry about anything else!"Hong Yitang nodded again and sighed,""I'm ... I'm taking advantage of you! If you're really willing to hand over the truth Dao universe to li daoheng or Zheng Yu ... I'm afraid these two won't deal with you anymore and will be extremely grateful to you ..."If Li Hao really did that, although the two of them were bad people, they might not necessarily target Li Hao.Having cultivated to their level ... The two of them could only admire Li Hao for his actions ... Of course, the premise was that they were not afraid of Li Hao taking revenge. Otherwise, it was still possible for them to kill him and get rid of him.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao suddenly laughed, and his laughter was somewhat arrogant."You can only take what I give you! If I don't give it to them ... Who do they think they are?"Li Hao was completely different from before.It was as if he was suffering from schizophrenia!However, it was so natural.I'm willing to give, I'm happy to.I'm not willing to give it to you. If you want to take it from me, you can ask my sword!Li Hao said no more. In the next moment, the universe of the great path was torn apart. A long river rippled. Li Hao stepped into it, followed by Hong Yitang. Li Hao's voice sounded in the outside world,""I'm going to go into seclusion again to comprehend sword intent! Martial uncle Hong will go into seclusion with me ... As for the education, Hongyu will arrange it herself!"As soon as these words came out, some people's hearts moved, and some people felt a little uneasy.As for the Queen who was far away ... She seemed to have heard it as well. She suddenly turned around and snorted."In the end, you still believed this King. You're also a heartless fellow. For your own sake, you still kill when you should."What seclusion!Hong Yitang was finished!She was certain that this time, Hong Yitang wouldn't be able to walk out of the great Dao universe. She pouted, but she felt that it was only natural. If it were her ... This threat was too great, and she would also solve this problem.But ... He still felt a little disappointed. I thought that you, Li Hao, had a better idea.Although killing Hong Yitang seemed to be the best solution to her.But this was the choice of a mediocre person ... Li Hao, that magical guy who had toyed with all the people and experts in the world, could only do this?This time, li daoheng was even more impressive."What a pity!"The Queen flew further and further away. Li Hao chose to take Hong Yitang with him. She felt that she was less afraid of Li Hao now. Suddenly, she felt that she should stay further away from him. Before, she had a small idea of joining Li Hao.However, at this moment, she felt that it was better not to be like this. That person was so cold-blooded and heartless.……Void Dao universe.The three powerhouses were still in pursuit. At this moment, Red Moon Emperor's avatar suddenly said,""That thing, is it deliberately teasing us?"He frowned slightly.He was a venerable sovereign, after all, so his eyesight was not bad.In the distance, that star had actually disappeared several times. In the end ... When they felt that they couldn't find it, it suddenly flickered and reappeared, somewhat ... Cheap! It was like a child, playing hide-and-seek with you. When you were about to catch it, it would run away instantly. When you stopped catching it, it would run out again to seduce you.This feeling was not good.It made the venerable sovereign feel like he had been teased and played by a star.He felt it, and Li daoheng and Zheng Yu naturally felt the same.At this moment, when the star in the distance saw that they had stopped chasing, it also stopped. It didn't seem to be flustered at all. It was somewhat curious. Go on, chase. Why did they stop chasing?Zheng Yu also took a look and chuckled.""How interesting! It seems that this fellow is really trying to hook us and play with us. The heart of the great Dao is indeed not so easy to capture! If he combined the two Dao universes, he would probably be able to lock onto it! Or, like Li Hao did, use some special methods to attract it. I'm afraid it'll be very difficult to catch it now!"
