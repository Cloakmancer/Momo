With a loud roar, a huge mouth seemed to appear on the long saber. A powerful and boundless devouring force appeared instantly and bit a hole in the Yin Yang grinding plate!The human King roared and his huge mouth disappeared. With a slash of his saber, the millstone was shattered with a loud boom!At this moment, the human King was slightly dazed, but he sneered and looked at Li Hao. Weren't you waiting for me?I broke it!And you?At this moment, all the creatures in chaos were worried for Li Hao. The human King had broken through yin and yang, and Su Yu had broken through life and death. Could Li Hao break the cage of five elements?The human King and Su Yu had broken Tian Fang Dao one after another.Li Hao looked at the cage that was getting smaller and smaller. He felt that the Tiger above his head was being suppressed inch by inch. At this moment, the suppression of the great Dao around him was getting stronger and stronger.If he didn't break the five elements now, it would be really embarrassing.The power of the five elements was actually stronger than that of yin and yang, life and death. The other DAOs were only two elements, but the five elements were five different great DAOs. To Tian Fang, the power of each great Dao was almost the same.Therefore, in reality, Li Hao's side was under more pressure.Li Hao wasn't trying to quibble, but ... The truth was as such.At this moment, Tian Fang suppressed spring and autumn again. This time, he only suppressed him, not killed him. He turned to Li Hao and thought,"I also want to see how you're going to break my five elements!"Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky.In the sky, the five elements revolved.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly looked at Yuan Shuo in the distance with a smile in his eyes.Yuan Shuo was currently holding er Mao's head. When he saw Li Hao looking at him, he felt his heart tighten. Why are you looking at me?"Although I cultivate the five elements, at this moment, the power of the five elements has been taken away by you. I can't do it. This time, don't expect teacher to do anything. There's nothing he can do."Five elements ..."Li Hao smiled. In an instant, sword intent emerged. A wave of sword intent emerged between heaven and earth. It was ...Yuan Shuo was shocked!This was ... The Azure light sword!Good boy!You're using a teacher as a simulation subject.The jade-green sword essence instantly merged into the five elements cage. In an instant, five great Dao emerged. At this moment, it seemed to be a little turbulent. The jade-green sword essence instantly merged into the five elements!Even Tian Fang was slightly stunned.How could this be?The Dao of the five elements revolved around the five elements, which were closely linked to each other. It couldn't be integrated into other DAOs, but at this moment, Li Hao's sword intent of Azure light was integrated into it.Li Hao laughed!As expected!His teacher was quite talented. He had integrated the Azure light sword intent into his five elements Dao. Li Hao was only learning and recalling how his teacher had integrated it. Teacher, you've wooed a girl and even developed a Dao-breaking technique! Unfortunately, you've been stopped by women all your life ... Otherwise, you'd be even stronger. Fine, today, I'll use your technique to break the five elements of heaven!In an instant, the sword essence completely integrated into it!The five elements cage instantly shook, and the sword will whistled. The great Dao of the five elements was surrounded by the sword will. In the blink of an eye, the sword will burst out, and the five elements cage exploded with a loud bang!Seeing this, Tian Fang laughed. As though he had thought of something, he looked at Yuan Shuo and laughed again,""Interesting ... The Azure light sword broke my five elements Dao. This was Yuan Shuo's idea, right?""The secret technique of the five birds sect!"Li Hao laughed and looked at the two. At this moment, the two of them were cursing in their hearts!This works too?Li Hao had really broken the five elements Dao easily.At this moment, a fierce tiger roared as the three of them charged towards Tian Fang. Without saying anything, Tian Fang flicked away Chunqiu with a finger. He looked at the three of them who were charging towards him. He was a little surprised that the three of them had broken through his Dao in an instant.But ... This was not enough!In an instant, the body suddenly split into three!

The one on the left was dressed in black, the one on the right was dressed in white, and the one in the middle was a little empty. He was in charge of three techniques.The one in the middle controlled space!In an instant, dynasty ran to the left, Su Yu ran to the right, and Li Hao ... Also ran to the left!"Get lost!" The human King cursed upon seeing this.This is too much!The one in the middle mastered the Dao of space and was definitely the strongest. Under normal circumstances, he would have killed him.Not today ... He was too strong. He was looking for a beating.It was better to deal with Tian Fang in black!Li Hao was actually snatching it from him. This guy had always been imposing and arrogant, but now, he was actually scared!Li Hao was also vexed. The one in the middle was obviously the strongest. It had the spatial Dao, the core Dao of Tian Fang. Human King, you're so arrogant, the oldest, and your slogan is the loudest.Just as Li Hao was about to speak, the human King roared and instantly accelerated, charging straight at the black-robed sky!He had even started to burn his vitality!Li Hao laughed in spite of himself. Helpless, he could only walk toward the illusionary Tian Fang. At this moment, Tian Fang in the middle also smiled."You three are still so interesting at this point. It seems that you have many differences. Li Hao, why don't you consider my opinion?"Li Hao appeared and slashed with his long sword!The power of the five elements erupted, as if taking revenge on the other party for suppressing him with the five elements earlier. His voice drifted,""What do you know? this is called fun! The human King is older than me, and Su Yu is younger than me. I was just joking with the human King. As the person who is connected to the three parties, I will naturally deal with your way of space myself!""Fun?"Tian Fang smiled and compressed the space. The invisible power of space blocked all the power of the great DAOs. He walked toward Li Hao as if he had entered an uninhabited place."Then it'll be fun to catch you."

Chapter 3861  624-Scheme (5)
In an instant, he appeared in front of Li Hao. The river path under Li Hao's feet didn't have much of an effect on him. He crossed it in an instant!Tian Fang was different from the heavenly Tribulation. At this moment, his spatial power was not compressed. Instead, it blocked all the despair. It was as if he was incompatible with heaven and earth, but also as if he was independent of heaven and earth!On both sides, a violent explosion had already erupted!On Li Hao's side, there was no sound. Tian Fang stretched out his hand, as if he wanted to capture Li Hao. A door appeared in front of Li Hao, and endless power of despair gushed out!This was not enough!Suddenly, a second door appeared. At that moment, countless wills for survival seemed to appear in the world."I don't want to die ...""I want to live!""Save me!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùAt this moment, countless living beings seemed to be shouting. The intense desire to live caused the door to expand and merge with the door of despair. Despair and the desire to live merged in the blink of an eye, forming a black and white sword!Li Hao's eyes lit up!He drew his sword!As the sword slashed out, the space seemed to be torn apart. In front of him, Tian Fang was too close. In an instant, a thunderous sound rang out as Tian Fang was forced back a step. At this moment, his illusory body gradually appeared.He looked at Li Hao and smiled again."This is interesting. I told you to fuse your will long ago. Did you have to wait until now to give me a surprise?"In an instant, he punched out!Black and white!It was as if it wanted to completely separate Li Hao's two wills!Li Hao didn't say a word, but released his boundless sword intent!Countless thoughts merged into the great Dao under his feet. The Dao of Jianghu spread again. At this moment, all living beings saw it. In their despair, there was some vitality and hope. For a moment, it became more complicated!At this moment, he suddenly hoped that Li Hao could kill Tian Fang.This person was too strong. Humans sympathized with the weak.So many people couldn't do anything to Tian Fang. At this moment, it was difficult for the common people to distinguish between friend and foe. They only knew that ... Since Tian Fang was so strong, he was definitely not a good person. If they didn't kill Tian Fang, they might not be able to live!"Sigh, a mediocre person doesn't know right from wrong."Tian Fang shook his head. How could these people understand what he was thinking?Once the absolute time and space appeared, everyone would be immortal and the space would be infinite. At that time, it would be the true Nirvana.Unfortunately, you don't understand.He couldn't be bothered to explain.It was better to do than to say.Li Hao laughed,'a mediocre person doesn't know right from wrong? Perhaps! However, Tian Fang, everything is just your wishful thinking! "Ask the chaotic common people if they're willing to go to your so-called absolute time and space. Do you really think that everyone wants to be immortal? Do you really think that there will be no disasters just because the space is boundless?""I don't know, so I want to try. What do you think? Everything will be revealed through practice!"Tian Fang was still calm.I don't know, so I want to try. I didn't even want to try the battle back then. I didn't even dare to try."Li Hao, don't use these little tricks anymore. Where's Shi Guang? Without time, you can't break through my space!"His eyes gradually turned cold."I've been giving you a chance. Now, use the power of time and gather time again. Perhaps you still have a chance. Otherwise ... You don't have any chance at all!" Be it despair or survival, in the face of space, they're all just illusions!"Then, he suddenly reappeared in front of Li Hao.

Tian Fang ignored the sword attack as if he was not in this space or dimension. He walked toward Li Hao, ignoring all attacks."Space is ever-changing, you can't even touch me! How do you plan to kill me?"Li Hao took a deep breath, but he didn't waver.Flowing time?"If I use time, I might be able to hit my opponent. However, if I use time, there might be some unpredictable changes. Tian Fang has always been looking forward to using time, but I won 't!""You should just stop thinking about it. As long as I don't want to or am unwilling to, you will never be able to see Shi Guang again in this lifetime!"Li Hao sneered. Tian Fang looked at him coldly. Suddenly, he turned to Yuan Shuo and then to Spring Autumn."What if I annihilate your master and your Silver Moon clan?""As you wish!"Tian Fang nodded in understanding.That made sense. If that was enough to threaten Li Hao, it wouldn't be worth looking forward to.He didn't really kill these small fries, as it didn't make much sense.In an instant, Li Hao suddenly broke through the void, and two divine runes appeared under his feet.The universe!In the distance, Emperor Yu was stunned and instantly looked over. At this moment, Li Hao stepped on the word "universe" and laughed."From top to bottom, all four directions, since ancient times, have been my soil!"In an instant, the great Dao of the pugilistic world spread!In an instant, a word appeared above his head,"tribulation"!In an instant, the power of countless tribulations appeared. The space around the sky, which had originally divided the space, trembled slightly. In an instant, a spatial barrier appeared. BOOM!Countless lightning bolts exploded!Tian Fang frowned slightly. Not far away, Emperor Yu couldn't help but curse,""You stole my technique!"Shameless!This is my signature divine text. Damn it!'This guy must have learned from the black scales ... No, he is the black scales himself. He secretly learned from me. Damn it. No wonder he doesn't care at all. In fact, I also know about the way of space.'So, he had learned it long ago!He was really shameless.Of course, the space great Dao of the myriad worlds was limited. After all, it was not as good as the space great Dao of the chaos great Dao. Therefore, even if Su Yu knew it, he would not be able to restrain Tian Fang.

Chapter 3862  624-Scheme (6)
Li Hao had only used it to force Tian Fang to appear in this space.At this moment, Li Hao was stepping on the divine runes, which seemed to be alive.It brought him into a special space. The originally ethereal Tian Fang appeared in front of him once again. This time, it was much more real."What do you think?" Li Hao smiled.Tian Fang furrowed his brows slightly. Without saying a word, he punched out. His fist broke through the mountains and rivers. The great Dao of the pugilistic world trembled violently as if it was about to shatter. The power of despair and survival also trembled violently at this moment!The countless lightning bolts around him were all shattered before they could even get close to Tian Fang!To Tian Fang, the power of the Tribulation wasn't even worth mentioning.In the blink of an eye, Li Hao made his move. He attacked with his sword, and in an instant, there were tens of thousands of swords. At this moment, the whole world was filled with sword intent. All kinds of sword intent. Li Hao presented all that he had learned in his life, all that he had comprehended in the myriad worlds, all that he had comprehended in the neo martial world, and all the great DAOs he had comprehended in the world of calamity!A Li Hao seemed to appear in all his cells.Dao after Dao emerged from his body.One thousand, two thousand, three thousand ...In the blink of an eye, it rose to the 9000 great Dao!All kinds of great Dao laws emerged madly, spreading and reorganizing in Li Hao's body. After a moment, the power of 98000 great DAOs emerged, but it was still not enough!Li Hao shouted!More great DAOs spread out crazily!The power of the world of tribulation was being madly extracted by him.One sword appeared with each strike!BOOM!With a loud sound, Li Hao was suddenly sent flying. Some sword marks appeared on the master of the sky. He smiled."You didn't disappoint me. Is that all?"It was close to 9900 Avenue.Unfortunately, although it didn't seem far from reaching 10000 DAOs, in reality, it would only get more difficult as one reached this level!Even though he had three clones, Li Hao was still no match for him!Li Hao's hand trembled, and blood flowed out of it, staining the longsword red. His eyes turned cold."Impressive. I thought that after devouring the Tribulation energy, the gap between us wouldn't be that great. In the end ... It seems like the gap between us is still as great as before!"At this moment, Li Hao suddenly disappeared, and so did Tian Fang.In an instant, Li Hao appeared beside Spring Autumn.At this moment, Spring Autumn had just broken Tian Fang's seal. As soon as he walked out, he saw Li Hao, and the next moment, he saw Tian Fang!He cursed in his heart!I just broke the seal."Spring and autumn!"The moment Li Hao appeared, he looked at Spring Autumn. Spring Autumn looked back at Li Hao. Why did you call me?I can't win against Tian Fang!"Do you still remember the words of the other day?"Spring and autumn was startled. He seemed to have thought of something and looked at Li Hao. You mean ...In an instant!The power of time appeared, and Spring Autumn instantly merged with it. The endless power of time made Spring Autumn a little dazed. At this moment, he knew what Li Hao wanted her to do.It devoured time and turned all bodies into spring and autumn!This ... Will it work?This won't do, right?How can there be so much energy and the power of the great Dao? besides, I can't control it, can I?Just as she was thinking, Tian Fang appeared and smiled.""I thought you really didn't need it!"You still used it!Even though it wasn't for me, it's the same for spring and autumn.This was even better! Just as Spring Autumn had thought, she had many clones, and they were all her. Right now, she even had the spirit of ten thousand emperors. However, this was not enough.Without sufficient energy, how could the clone be powerful?Unless ...At this moment, Li Hao bellowed and grabbed toward Spring Autumn with one hand. Spring Autumn paused, and a long river appeared above her head, rushing toward the chaos great Dao!That was the Silver Moon River!In an instant, a person appeared. It was the Queen. The Queen was terrified, but she couldn't care about anything else. Countless power of faith burst forth and she instantly merged into the chaos great Dao! Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ In an instant, the chaos great Dao and the Silvermoon River connected!Primal Chaos energy began to fuse with spring and autumn!Tian Fang laughed. He controlled the great Dao of chaos, and Li Hao wanted to use this River of small Dao to seize the power of Chaos and satisfy the needs of the spring and autumn era. He was too naive! Spring Autumn had been trying to merge with the Silver Moon River all this time. It was obvious that this was not Li Hao's sudden idea, but a step he had been planning for a long time.At that moment, the chaos great Dao appeared above Tian Fang's head. At that moment, a gap seemed to have appeared on the great Dao, and endless chaos power fused into the spring and autumn!Tian Fang coldly snorted!He could make Li Hao stronger, but he couldn't make Spring Autumn stronger. This wasn't the result he wanted to see.The chaos great Dao suddenly trembled!The Queen let out a shrill scream!In an instant, it was as if ten thousand arrows had pierced her heart. She only had the power of a rank seven. At this moment, she had merged with the chaos great Dao and used her faith to open up a passage. However, as soon as Tian Fang moved, she felt the pain of being torn apart!In the blink of an eye, the Queen showed signs of being completely torn apart.He was too strong!Even though Tian Fang had only used a little of his strength to deal with the Queen, it was more than enough. In an instant, Li Hao's sword appeared. Tens of thousands of swords appeared, and the power of calamity suddenly burst out and poured into the chaos great Dao!BOOM!The loud sound reverberated!A piece of divine text headed straight for the chaos great Dao. It was the word 'calamity'.Tian Fang instantly disappeared and reappeared in the blink of an eye, grabbing at the "calamity" character!The next second, he suddenly laughed, Li Hao, do you think I'm blind?In an instant!BOOM!The chaos great Dao rumbled again, and a dog in the depths of the great Dao suddenly screamed!Tian Fang sneered. This time, he was really sneering.Do you really think I don't know about the Black Panther's integration?Am I that stupid?What do you want to do?To let it devour the origin of chaos?Should he take advantage of the turmoil and let Black Panther take action?You're underestimating me!Li Hao's expression changed drastically."I've already mastered the chaos great Dao. Do you think ... You can hide it from me?"He laughed!For the first time, he saw Li Hao lose his composure. Li Hao roared,""Black Panther, bite!"In the depths of chaos, the black leopard was in extreme pain. At that moment, a heaven's direction seemed to have appeared in the origin of chaos. The black leopard did not care about this and bit the origin of chaos!BOOM!A loud sound rang out, and in an instant, all of the dog's teeth were shattered!Its entire body was instantly damaged. Tian Fang, who was in the origin of chaos, struck out with his palm. The Black Panther didn't even have time to wail before it exploded with a crack!It shattered into pieces and completely shattered."Black Panther!" Li Hao roared, his face full of anger.Tian Fang laughed."Li Hao, how is it now?"The Black Panther was the Silver Moon's spirit, and the Silver Moon River was connected to the chaos great Dao. If the Black Panther could take a bite of the origin, it would be able to instantly absorb endless chaos power and send it to Chunqiu through the Silver Moon River. Chunqiu might really be able to burst out with unparalleled power!Unfortunately ... The Black Panther was dead.He was too weak!If he was stronger, there would be no hope!Li Hao was a little dazed. Spring Autumn had also felt the vibration of the chaos great Dao. The Silvermoon River was about to be pushed out. He was helpless.Tian Fang was really too strong!Although Li Hao had many schemes, Heibao ... Had been killed, so there was nothing he could do.She was also extremely depressed!Not only was Tian Fang extremely powerful, but his insight was also unparalleled. In the blink of an eye, he had defeated Black Panther and cut off Li Hao's hope. Now ... He was really done for."You're looking for death!"At this moment, Li Hao was completely furious and crazy. Holding the longsword, his black clothes were instantly torn apart. Endless power of despair emerged, even obliterating his will to survive."I walked out of the Silver Moon," he roared,"and it has been with me since then. No one can kill it, not even you!" Tian Fang, I want you dead!"The killing intent instantly covered the entire area.Like a mad demon, Li Hao stepped on the divine runes and charged forward. In Tian Fang's hand, the divine rune "calamity" also erupted with an extremely powerful force of calamity. It covered Tian Fang and was about to suppress him!Clearly, Black Panther's death had destroyed Li Hao's hope and driven him completely mad.

Chapter 3863 Time And Space (1)
In the chaos great Dao, Black Panther was killed on the spot.Li Hao charged at Tian Fang like a mad demon.At this moment, the spring Autumn Emperor was dejected and helpless.In fact, if she could really deal with Tian Fang, she would be willing to help, but ... She couldn't do it now. Although her clone was growing stronger, she didn't have enough energy. At this moment, she couldn't make her clone grow stronger.The Black Panther was connected to the chaos great Dao, so there was still hope of absorbing chaos energy. But now that the Black Panther was gone, Li Hao's plan had failed!All of a sudden, there was no hope."Don't just stand there, spring and autumn!" Li Hao roared."Devour the world and strengthen your clone. Let the Monarchs help you devour the power of the world ..."Spring autumn's heart skipped a beat. This was not impossible.At this moment, he was rapidly flying into the distance.However, the space around them seemed to have been sealed. As he fought Li Hao and blocked Spring Autumn, he said indifferently,""If we had come earlier, we would have had a chance, but it's too late now."Black Panther's death had cut off Li Hao's hope and made him despair. This was the result he had been waiting for.He had long since known that the Black Panther had fused with the chaos great Dao.A seventh rank venerable sovereign had melded his Dao into it. Even though he had been fighting, he had sensed it. The Black Panther's concealment ability was very strong, and Li Hao had created many opportunities for the Black Panther, but he had not been able to hide it from him.At this moment, seeing Li Hao's hysteria, he revealed a smile in his indifference.It's to make you despair!A person like Li Hao wouldn't take the initiative to fuse with a body unless he was completely desperate.Break all your pride!At this moment, the power of tribulation erupted wildly. After absorbing the world of calamity, Li Hao was extremely powerful when he used the power of tribulation!Spring Autumn was trying to break through the space, but he was helpless.Seeing that Li Hao's group of three was being suppressed, they felt helpless.There was no way to fight this!The Heaven's Will wasn't split into three but four. There was still a clone guarding the chaos great Dao. Black Panther's breakthrough failed. At this moment, the Silvermoon River connected to the chaos great Dao was also trembling violently. It looked like it was about to break.The Queen had also absorbed some Primal Chaos energy, but ... It was like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood!After all, the Queen was only at Level Seven. Furthermore, at this moment, there was still the tianfang clone standing guard in the great Dao, suppressing the power of ten thousand DAOs. The Queen could only absorb a little bit, which was not enough to satisfy the needs of the countless clones."Lingyue!"At this moment, Li Hao's voice was cold."Hold on for a while. Maintain the passage!"Then, he turned to look at the human King and Su Yu, and shouted,""Suppress his clones and stall him. As long as we have enough time, lingyue can help Chun Qiu strengthen all of his clones. Time is on our side!" Stall Tian Fang? Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ In the distance, the human King was panting, and Emperor Yu was also exhaling. Even if the clone they were dealing with wasn't as strong as Li Hao 's, Tian Fang's strength was unparalleled. He wasn't easy to deal with.It would be very difficult to suppress them, but there was still hope of stalling them.However, how long would it take for the Queen to extract the power of the great Dao alone?In addition, there was a clone within the primal Chaos origin.Once he attacked and killed the Queen ... The connection with the Silver Moon River would be completely cut off.Tian Fang did not say anything.He looked at Li Hao, who kept fending off Li Hao's attacks, and then at the chaos great Dao. Deep in the great Dao, he had an avatar, a chaos avatar.This was also the reason why he was so confident.His four clones were all extremely powerful, and with the chaos great Dao in place, Li Hao and the others would only grow weaker as they fought. He, on the other hand ... Could continuously absorb the origin of chaos.It could be said that from the very beginning, he had an undefeatable foothold!This was the reason why he was so confident.How could I not be confident?If there were so many rank nines still alive, he might not have been able to control the chaos great Dao. However, as they all died, he was the only rank nine of the chaos great Dao.Li Hao had broken away from the chaos great Dao on the day the sky was split open. At this moment, there was still a Queen ... A level Seven cultivator, who was extremely weak.Why would he care?The power of tribulation covered Tian Fang. Tian Fang frowned slightly as he looked at the power of tribulation gathering crazily. The divine character 'tribulation' was also summoning the power of tribulation from all directions. Countless Thunderbolts appeared, and even a Thunder tribulation domain appeared!The Lord of calamity wasn't weak at the last moment.However, to Tian Fang, he wasn't too strong.Of course, he was only one of the clones, and Li Hao himself was no weakling. At this moment, he was stepping on divine runes and breaking through space, and his killing power was emerging. It was indeed not easy to deal with him.Li Hao's power of despair was getting stronger and stronger!Not only was the Queen's absorption speed extremely slow, but the tianfang clone guarding the origin also seemed to be about to attack. He roared,""Second cat, duplicate the Silvermoon Galaxy!"In the distance, second cat didn't waste any more time. He jumped up and the power of his great Dao appeared. A special wave appeared.It was heading straight for the Silver Moon River!The Silver Moon River was controlled by Qian Wuliang, who had reached level 8, and so was ermo. After Li Hao took away his flesh and blood, ermo no longer had the strength of level 9.However, although it was difficult to copy the Silver Moon River, it was not impossible.In an instant, a similar River appeared near the primal Chaos moonbed and connected to the spring and autumn clone. On the other side, it covered the primal Chaos moonbed!Deep within the origin of chaos.Tian Fang, whose life force was extremely dense, raised his eyebrows. Er Mao, copy great Dao, the core Dao of battle. One had to say that the things left behind by battle were all fine.

Chapter 3864 Time And Space (2)
Including second cat.The great Dao could be copied at any time. As long as er Mao was strong enough, there was nothing it couldn't copy.As the second Silvermoon River appeared and fused with the chaos great Dao, the chaos power flowed even faster and began to flow into the Spring and Autumn period.In the origin of chaos, the tianfang clone moved slightly and walked out of the origin of chaos.There was a slight hesitation.Li Hao was full of tricks. Although he was young, Tian Fang had to admit that Li Hao had too many tricks up his sleeve. If it weren't for him, the other level nine experts probably wouldn't have noticed the Black Panther sneaking into the origin of chaos.If the opponent wasn't him, he would probably have suffered.At this moment, what Tian Fang was thinking about was whether Li Hao ... Was really at his wit's end, or ... He had other thoughts.His anger, his despair, were they real?The four avatars were all very strong, but Li Hao and the others were not weak either, especially Li Hao, who had extracted the power of despair and survival will, gathered the origins of the myriad worlds to form a physical body, and seized the power of calamity. Together with black scale, he had also devoured the power of desires of countless worlds.With all these factors combined, Li Hao's current combat ability was not really weak.It could guard the origin of chaos and ensure that it would not be lost.If he left now, would there be any accidents?He was just about to leave when he suddenly stopped in his tracks. He chuckled and continued to stand guard in the land of origin, unmoving like a mountain. Two cats 'Dao of duplication was special, but duplication ... Required energy.Based on the speed of er Mao and the rate at which he absorbed the primal Chaos energy, if he wanted to perfect all of his spring and autumn clones ... He would have to wait!When would he be able to wait?At this moment, spring and autumn might be able to grow stronger, but there was a limit to it. Tian Fang was worried that Li Hao had other plans. Once his clone left the origin of chaos, would there be any accidents?The origin of chaos was equivalent to an energy storage device that stored the energy of the entire chaos.Once this thing was lost ... No matter how strong he was, an accident might happen.At that moment, second cat had duplicated a great Dao and was extremely tired. In fact, it felt helpless. Duplicating one was fine, but duplicating a lot ... It couldn't do anything about it. Duplicating a great Dao out of thin air, and a powerful rank eight great Dao at that, was not that easy.At this moment, second cat stuck out its tongue and panted as it looked at Li Hao in the distance.He then raised his head to look at tianfang's clone in the origin of chaos. After staying with Li Hao for a long time, he could more or less understand Li Hao's thoughts. Li Hao ... Actually hoped to draw away Tian Fang's clone that was guarding the origin of chaos. Otherwise, having him replicate the great Dao would be like trying to put out a cart of firewood with a cup of water.If he knew, didn't li Hao?He was an extremely intelligent person, so how could he not understand this logic?Second cat gasped for breath. At this moment, it used its brain for once. It didn't want to use its brain as it was very tired. This was something it had inherited from the old cat.Following Li Hao, she didn't need to use her brain.However, at this moment ...Second cat quickly thought about it. This couldn't go on. Tian Fang was a very smart person. At this moment, although he was a little hesitant and wanted to kill the queen and second cat, he didn't make a move.It would be very difficult to lure them out! "Big cat!"At that moment, second cat called out!In the distance.On the blade in the human king's hand, a big cat's head appeared, just like second cat's head. He asked curiously,""Why?""They're fighting!"The human King cursed.Why are you sticking your head out at this time?BOOM!

Second cat called out.Big cat was stunned, not knowing what second cat was going to do. Although the heaven peeking mirror was also a sovereign weapon, at this moment, it was not of much use to everyone.However, bigcat was too lazy to think about it.It opened its mouth and countless monarch weapons appeared. It loved to collect and had a lot of junk. Of course, they were all treasures to ordinary people, but to them, they weren 't.It was almost useless in such a battle, including its favorite fishing rod.In an instant, countless pieces of junk flew towards second cat.The black-robed Tian Fang wanted to break these, but the human King's Blade stopped him from breaking them. Although Tian Fang knew that it wouldn't be of much use, he was still on guard against the core Dao spirit.However, since he had already flown out, he didn't bother about it!Er Mao immediately took the weapons and the heaven peeking mirror exploded with a bright light ring. After taking a closer look, er Mao was delighted."I knew it."There were small fish swimming in the heaven peeking mirror. The key was not these small fish, but these small fish seemed to be Dao spirits.Big cat liked to rear fish, and these fish were actually also strong. However, they had been forced to turn around. In fact, most of these strong people were venerable sovereigns, and some of them were not weak.A portion of them had a great Dao running through the chaos great Dao, but it was not too obvious.Second cat took out all the small fish in an instant. It knew big cat's habits and knew that big cat must have kept all these small fish in the heaven peeking mirror. It was indeed so!In an instant!Countless fish appeared, and it didn't matter what they were. They all began to merge together, until the fish in its hand was a sphere.It was like ... Time!In the origin of chaos, the eyes of tianfang's clone suddenly flickered!

Chapter 3865 Time And Space (3)
At this moment, the ground under his feet trembled slightly, as if ... He had seen something incredible. His expression changed slightly, and he was about to walk out.He was a little shocked.This was Shi Guang?How was that possible?That was impossible!At this moment, a Halo appeared around er Mao's body. His eyes were filled with sorrow,"the teacher ... Can only find you ..."In an instant, time seemed to reverse!The small star in the claw emitted a faint time radiance as if time was flowing backward. A vague figure gradually appeared in the star. That figure ...This caused Tian Fang to be slightly dazed.It was him!Battle!The core Dao of war, second cat, had actually instantly reconstructed a time star. It had reversed the flow of war.How was that possible?Flowing time was the only one!Li Hao could still use it, but logically speaking, it was impossible for second cat to use it. Why ... Could second cat use it?Tian Fang was a little dazed.Shi Guang was not the only one?This was impossible!The image slowly appeared and the two cats were overjoyed,""He's a teacher ..."Actually, fighting wasn't that strong.At its peak, it was only a sixth stage venerable sovereign.If one comprehended a Dao that could be used for battle to the extreme, and if one could limitlessly absorb Primal Chaos energy, one might be able to easily reach tier 9. This was battle.More importantly, this was the true time King.Once they fought, they would really be resurrected and walk out. They would absorb the power of the great Dao and might become a true peak expert.The tianfang clone's expression changed.Even the spatial clone's expression changed slightly. Li Hao glanced in that direction, and his eyes flickered. He suddenly smiled and said,""Alright, alright, alright. Haven't you been waiting for the collision of time and space? "I'll fulfill your wish. Once you walk out and absorb the power of countless great DAOs, you'll definitely be able to reach the peak of time ... Tian Fang, you won't need us to do anything! I'll let you experiment with me!"Tian Fang looked at Zhan's figure in the distance and frowned slightly.In fact, fighting was the best choice for a spacetime collision!He only needed to fight one person."Chunqiu!" Li Hao bellowed."Transfer the power of your great Dao to Zhan so that he can reach level nine quickly. Let him and Tian Fang experiment with this absolute space-time!""You can't ..." At this moment, Tian Fang suddenly muttered and shook his head.""No... This shouldn't be. Time is unique. How could there be two cultivators who control time? if that's the case, the power of time would be divided ..."Li Hao and Su Yu had both mastered some spatial power, but they were relatively insignificant spatial power. They were only some of the spatial way that Li Hao had used to open the sky.But time ... Zhan was the founder, while Li Hao was the controller.At that time, there might be a drastic change! Tian Fang glanced at Li Hao, then at Zhan's shadow. His eyes flickered. Who should he keep?Battle ... Was it really a battle that was summoned by second cat?He didn't know, nor was it easy to judge. He had mastered ten thousand DAOs. The only thing he wasn't proficient in was time. Otherwise, he wouldn't be doing this.In the next moment, the tianfang clone in the origin of chaos still moved.It followed the chaos great Dao and began to spread down.Li Hao's expression changed. He roared, and the power of tribulation spread along the chaos great Dao. He shouted coldly,""Don't even think about it!""Chunqiu, what are you waiting for?"Spring Autumn was a little hesitant, but she didn't have a better idea at this time. She could only fly to second cat's side. After some hesitation, she still transferred the power of her great Dao to second cat.Dumb cat turned around and looked at Spring Autumn ... Spring Autumn saw that look and was confused.Second cat's eyes were a little ... Complicated.It was as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he didn 't.In the chaos great Dao, the power of tribulation spread wildly. Outside, the three of them were fighting the sky side's clone. At this moment, Li Hao was fighting the space sky side while controlling the power of tribulation. He was in a dilemma.It was extremely difficult!Crack!A bloody wound appeared on his body as he was cut by the space. Blood flowed freely in the sky. He shook his head slightly.When combined with the power of tribulation, it'll be difficult for you to deal with me alone.At this moment, they still had to split their strength. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ That would be even more difficult!Li Hao was knocked back in an instant, and the chaos clone in the chaos great Dao punched out lightly. As if ten thousand DAOs were roaring in unison, the power of tribulation spreading from below was greatly dispersed in an instant!The chaos clone stomped on the ground, suppressing the Tribulation energy. He followed the chaos Dao, emerging from the depths and heading straight for the two cats.At that moment, a shadow floated in front of second cat.The chaos doppelganger was about to reach the Queen's location. The Queen's face was pale!It's finished!The power of tribulation could not stop this clone. Once the other party came down, she would be the first to die.What to do?Should I run?If they ran now, they might still have a chance. However, if they ran now, they would not even have a chance. They would not be able to absorb the power of Chaos ... Even if ermao conjured Zhan, without an energy source, Zhan would not become stronger out of thin air!At this moment, Li Hao roared,""I can't let his clone come out! The two of you, aren't you going to risk your lives?"In the distance, the human king and emperor Yu both sighed softly.You only know how to force us, what about you?He really ... Had no choice.In that instant, the dark energy in the human King's body surged out madly. The countless impurities in the world surged into his body, as if all the impurities in the chaos had been sucked out!The blade that the big cat had transformed into instantly expanded into a massive spherical blade. The big cat's face appeared, and it seemed to be in pain.

Chapter 3866 Time And Space (4)
It was originally the source of neo martial arts, or the source of darkness.At this moment, forcefully devouring the source of darkness around him and all the impurities was a little uncomfortable. Even the black-robed Tian Fang seemed to have some energy devoured, and his aura of a human king rose greatly!Without any nonsense, his flesh and blood suddenly collapsed, as if turning into a cage!It was like ... A cage!Within an inch!At this moment, it was as if the surroundings had been completely isolated. This was the technique of the human King's inner world. At this moment, his flesh and blood seemed to have become an incomparably solid cage. The human King's face was pale, and he was no longer laughing or cursing.It surrounded the black-robed Tian Fang and the huge long blade in his hand went straight for the black-robed Tian Fang!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the other side.The civilization book in Emperor Yu's hands suddenly fell and shattered page by page. It was as if it was evolving into a myriad of worlds. His figure gradually became illusory, as if he had entered the state between life and death.A huge seal suddenly appeared in his hand!That huge seal was the seal of the human Emperor in the hands of the human Emperor of the myriad realms. At this moment, an aura of the emperor's path emerged. Suddenly, order was established in the surroundings, and countless power of rules overflowed!In the blink of an eye, a world of ten thousand worlds appeared.The huge seal slammed down towards the white-robed man!It was as if the mountains and rivers had been imprinted. Countless divine runes interweaved and seemed to want to crush the white-robed Tian Fang.A large amount of chaos power was extracted from the entire chaos great Dao. The Tian Fang clone trembled slightly and lost some energy, but it didn't have much of an effect.He did not care about that and continued to head towards the Queen and second cat. The catastrophe Holy prose beneath his feet was still suppressed. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ At this point, all the chaotic beings who were watching the battle sighed in their hearts.No!It still didn't work.Even though these people had used all kinds of methods and risked their lives, each of their four clones was extremely powerful. They were not weaker than Li Hao's clones, and were even stronger.This kind of battle ... Made people feel despair.He could not see any hope at all!Spring Autumn continued to pour in the power of his great DAOs. He was extremely anxious, but he couldn't do anything. This was because ... Er Mao was absorbing too slowly. The shadow didn't seem to improve much.This also cut off spring autumn's hope. If she couldn't do it, this so-called battle wouldn't work either. It was completely different from what she had imagined. She couldn't instantly draw countless great Dao power. In her imagination, everyone was talking about fighting. Logically speaking, if the other party really walked out, it was normal for him to instantly reach the ninth-rank.In the end ... He was just for show?Spring Autumn gritted his teeth. It was actually just for show!This old woman's expectations were really in vain!You're not even as good as me!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao looked helpless.The sky was still suppressing him. Suddenly, he frowned and looked at the two cats. His eyes flickered. This battle ... Although he had absorbed some great Dao power, it was still weak.It wasn't as he had imagined ... He had interacted with Zhan before, and in this life, he felt that in terms of comprehension of the great Dao, Zhan might be the truly unparalleled person.Therefore, he was a little afraid of fighting.There was also ... An indescribable feeling.Perhaps, it was fear?Or was it jealousy?I can't say it!So when second cat was summoning him, he felt ... That everything was out of control. He wanted to complete absolute time and space, but he also hoped that everything was under his control!He was used to controlling the situation.In fact, Li Hao and the others were all under his control. Even now, they couldn't cause any trouble.But the appearance of Zhan might break all of this.That was why his chaos clone made a move.However ... Spring and autumn was still a tier 9, after all. After losing the power of great DAOs for so long, the shadow of battle seemed to have only condensed a little ...It was somewhat inappropriate!Li Hao, on the other hand, suddenly sneered."You've been tricked!"Eh?Was there really a problem?While the spatial clone was thinking, a star suddenly appeared behind Li Hao. It seemed to be ... Another time path, and an illusionary shadow appeared on it!His aura was much stronger than that of second cat 's!In the blink of an eye, Li Hao's aura rapidly declined as if he was about to reach level 9. He looked at Tian Fang and sneered,""Since I can't defeat you, and I don't want the human Emperor and the others to be melted, why don't I ... Melt into the battle myself, give everyone hope, and leave the despair to me!" Tian Fang's aura instantly became stronger!Was he planning to do this?Li Hao was the real person in the summoning battle. Second cat was just a cover!His aura suddenly became much stronger, and the aura of the chaos clone in the chaos great Dao instantly weakened. I knew something was wrong. With Li Hao's intelligence, he shouldn't be so simple!I was right!However, Li Hao had thought too simply of it."The time star has appeared ... Very good ..."Tian Fang's aura instantly strengthened, and he revealed a smile.Everything about you will still be hard to escape from your control. There is an absolute difference in strength. No matter how much you plan, it will still not work!And at this moment ...The power of tribulation that had been suppressed in the chaos great Dao suddenly seemed to transform into a world of its own. The word "tribulation" instantly appeared, and at this moment, deep within the divine text, there seemed to be ... A dog!The moment he seized the realm of calamity, Li Hao didn't refine it completely. Instead, he gave it to the Black Panther and had it leave behind a large amount of spirit.In the chaos great Dao, the Black Panther that was killed was the physical body of the Black Panther, as well as a part of its spirituality.

Chapter 3867 Time And Space (3)
However, Black Panthers ... Actually didn't have much of a physical body to begin with.Its body had been completely destroyed a long time ago and merged into the Silver Moon world. Its body had only been refined after it had seized a Beast of Chaos.If it was gone, then it was gone. It had long been like heaven's will, alternating between reality and illusion.At this moment, the divine character "calamity" seemed to have transformed into a Black Panther. The divine character contained the peak power of the sky-opening calamity. Although it was not as powerful as Tian Fang or Li Hao, it was not far off.In an instant, the divine text opened its mouth and bit at the clone of the origin of chaos without a sound.The space clone had just absorbed a part of his power, but now, one of his legs was bitten off!Everything happened in a flash!It was extremely fast!The Black Panther's eyes were cold, like a Hound in the dark. When it was shattered, it knew why Li Hao had asked it to merge a large amount of its spirituality into the realm of calamity.After biting off the leg of the clone, the Black Panther suddenly reached out its claws. At this moment, the entire chaos great Dao trembled violently like a river. The Black Panther was extremely fast as it struck out with its claws!It was like ... Nine overlapping waves!A powerful force surged out of the black Panther's body. Countless forces of tribulation stacked together in an instant. With a crack, the Black Panther's paw shattered the clone's lower body!Countless lifeforce surged out, and the Black Panther opened its mouth and swallowed it. The next moment, Chunqiu's expression changed as countless lifeforce and power of great DAOs surged into her body and seemed to be transported into her body through the Silver Moon River.This scene happened too quickly!In the sky, his expression changed slightly, and he punched at Li Hao. Li Hao was already prepared. In an instant, countless pieces of flesh and blood turned into sword intent and attacked. Then, a long river appeared below him. It was not made of great Dao, but flesh and blood.The blood and flesh formed a long river and the surrounding space instantly turned blood-red.Tian Fang's fist instantly shattered the sword intent and hit the blood-red wall. The wall trembled violently, and countless pieces of flesh were shattered. Li Hao, who was hiding behind the wall, kept retreating with a pale face!Looking up at the sky, the Black Panther was also extremely brutal. It bit down once again and broke the avatar of the origin of chaos in one bite! Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ Without even looking back, he headed straight into the depths of the chaos!It wanted to bite the true origin of chaos to pieces!"Hmph!"The space in the sky also sensed that his other avatar had almost been completely devoured by the Black Panther. With a cold snort, the origin of chaos in the depths of chaos suddenly trembled violently!"Bang!""Bang!"The sound of a beating heart appeared. At this moment, the heart in the depths seemed to have come alive again. At this moment, the Black Panther had already arrived and bit down ... But in an instant, just like the chaos that day, with a loud bang, the teeth ... Broke!Heibao's eyes revealed a trace of disbelief!That was impossible!Li Hao had made so many preparations. At this moment, he even killed Tian Fang's clone that was guarding the origin. He had thought that this time would be different from the day of chaos. He had refined a world of calamity, so he would be able to bite through the origin of chaos. In the end...The seemingly defenseless origin of chaos had actually blocked its incomparably sharp teeth! It directly shattered its teeth!Everyone saw this scene. Li Hao let out a breath and sighed.There was such a prediction, it was just that ... He did not expect that it was really strong to this level. That day, long Zhan was able to devour a little, it could be said that it was simply unbelievable.As for the human king and emperor Yu, they both raised their heads to look.They all revealed looks of regret!He had failed!At this moment, Black Panther was refining the realm of calamity. It could be said that he was a top-notch existence. However, such an existence had actually failed. The origin of chaos itself was extremely sturdy!The space heavenly square laughed."The origin of chaos gave birth to and nurtured all of chaos. My clone is actually only cultivating, not protecting. Li Hao, you're wrong!"Do you think that my clone is protecting the prime essences of chaos?It wasn 't.It was just that it was more suitable for cultivation there.He was unwilling to leave because he could absorb more chaotic energy to provide to his clones. It did not mean that if he left, the origin of chaos could be devoured at will.That day, long Zhan was able to successfully devour a little, that was because ... Long Zhan was only a Dragon Soul that day, and not ... A physical body!The Dragon Soul was the purest form of spiritual power and willpower. The Black Panther was using the power of tribulation, which was the great Dao of chaos. He already had the power of the great Dao, so how could he hurt the origin of chaos?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Deep in the chaos.A hint of disappointment appeared in Black Panther's eyes. In order to succeed, Li Hao had already worked very hard, but it still didn't work!He had failed!The tooth had been broken, but it had not been able to leave a wound on the origin of chaos, the heart.At this moment, Black Panther also recalled the matter of long Zhan that day.Suddenly, his eyes flickered. In an instant, he suddenly jumped up and flew toward the origin of chaos again. At this moment, a great momentum, like a will, appeared on the Black Panther's head."Woof!"A cry resounded in all directions. Since the power of tribulation didn't work, then ... He would use force!Like a dog!A black shadow flickered and instantly pounced towards the origin of chaos. The Black Panther was instantly overjoyed. It seemed ... Possible.

Chapter 3868 Time And Space (6)
The power dog opened its mouth and bit down on the origin!This time ... There was a faint cracking sound. Crack ... It was as if a small piece of flesh had been bitten off. A small hole appeared above the heart, and essence power poured into the black Panther. The Black Panther did nothing to stop it.Instead, it was instantly transmitted back to the Silvermoon world, and Silvermoon instantly infused the power into the spring and autumn clone! In an instant, Spring Autumn could feel ... At least a thousand of her clones had suddenly become stronger. She didn't need to increase her comprehension of the realms, as they were all her. In an instant, thousands of clones appeared and fused into her body.The power of spring and autumn instantly became much stronger!She was ecstatic!Was it a success?However, in the next second, a shrill dog bark was heard. BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the entire chaos!"Bang Bang Bang ..."As if their hearts had been stimulated, they began to beat violently. The moment they beat, the earth shook, and the chaos trembled. Even Li Hao and the others were slightly stunned. In other places, the mountains collapsed and the earth cracked, and the world shook!It was as if his heart was in pain.The massive backlash caused the Black Panther's momentum to dissipate, but it gritted its teeth and opened its mouth again, biting at the chaos origins once more!It was only at this moment that Tian Fang's voice seemed to contain some emotion and anger for the first time.""Li Hao, enough! The origin of chaos is the key to stabilizing the entire chaos. If it's consumed too much and really shattered...This chaos will completely collapse and be destroyed!"It was only at this moment that he felt a little annoyed.Before this, even though these people had been struggling and retaliating, and even when the Black Panther had sneaked an attack on his clone, he had not been angry. However, when he saw the heart beating wildly and the small wounds left by the Black Panther, he was a little angry!In an instant, the black-robed Tian Fang and the white-robed Tian Fang disappeared as if they had never appeared. In the blink of an eye, they merged into the space Tian Fang's body.He no longer had a clone!With the three avatars as one, his aura skyrocketed and returned to his previous appearance. He was extremely powerful and his aura was unbelievably powerful.The power of the turbulent chaos great Dao no longer collapsed under the integration of the avatars.Tian Fang didn't care about Li Hao. Instead, he instantly disappeared and reappeared inside the chaos Dao. Li Hao's expression changed. He rushed forward and shouted,""Black Panther, let's go!"Tian Fang was going to stop Black Panther.

The Black Panther in front of them did not retreat. Instead, it continued to bite madly!Mouthful after mouthful, the power of countless great DAOs and origin energies were devoured like blood. In the blink of an eye, they entered Chunqiu's body, and he felt himself becoming stronger and stronger!At this moment, he was also shocked.This dog ... Was also a demon.It was actually so brutal! The Black Panther let out a muffled growl. It knew that the only way to strengthen spring and autumn and weaken heaven's will was to seize more essence power.Otherwise, they wouldn't have had the chance to defeat Tian Fang."Aowu ..."A dog's bark was heard as if it was protecting its food. The Black Panther lay on the violently shaking heart like the most brutal demon, biting it one after another, until the heart was full of holes.Tian Fang's figure flickered and in the blink of an eye, he appeared near the Black Panther."What an evil beast!"Tian Fang was completely enraged. He looked at the origin of chaos, which had been bitten into a bloody mess by the dog. Large amounts of life force and power of great DAOs were rapidly flowing away. The calmness on his face disappeared and was replaced with anger as he punched the Black Panther!He felt that he shouldn't have been angered by a dog, but the origin of chaos was the foundation of his strength. He shouldn't have been angry, but he had to be!He had originally thought that no matter how strong the dog was, it would be difficult to bite through the origin of chaos.He didn't expect that ... It was a dog that knew its place!Otherwise, the final result would be like chaos, where there was no way to shake the origin of chaos.Moreover, this dog didn't even run away when he was here!The shadow of a fist appeared and went straight for the Black Panther's body. The Black Panther's body was the "calamity" character, which contained all of the Black Panther's spirituality. Once the divine character was broken, the Black Panther was truly dead.It wasn't like before, where only a portion of its spirituality was destroyed.As for Tian Fang, he was determined to kill the Black Panther this time. He showed no mercy, but the Black Panther didn't care. At this moment, it only had one thought and continued to bite. The more it bit, the weaker Tian Fang would be, the stronger spring and autumn would be, and Li Hao would be safer!It was just a stray dog in the mortal world.If it weren't for Li Hao, she might have already entered the dog meat restaurant.Without Li Hao, they would have starved to death on the streets.If it weren't for Li Hao ... A dog, even if it was still alive, it would have reached the end of its lifespan.In its eyes, Li Hao would always be its master, not the Silver Moon King, not the Silver Moon Marchioness, not the time King. He was just its master, and a dog was supposed to protect its master.Today, even if he was beaten to death, he would completely bite the origin of chaos to pieces!"Don't you dare!"At this moment, Li Hao, who was behind them, suddenly roared!An extremely powerful time energy appeared, and as if time was flowing backward, it clashed with space energy. With a boom, Tian Fang's fist vanished, and he suddenly turned back!At this moment, Li Hao snorted coldly. A real star appeared between his eyebrows, and the power of time spread out. This star was connected to all of Li Hao's flesh and cells.

Chapter 3869 Time And Space (7)
Li Hao reached out and grabbed. Spring Autumn suddenly landed near Li Hao. Spring Autumn was very strong, but he did not resist. He only looked at Li Hao in confusion. She had no idea what to do now.At this moment, seeing Li Hao's cold eyes, he actually felt a little scared.She heard Li Hao's voice.""Take me, the human King, and Su Yu into your clone. The three of us will guard the three bodies, and you will be the core. Do you remember that day when we walked over, you and I worked together?Spring Autumn was shocked!I remember!But ... Li Hao was the host that day, so why am I the host today?She didn't expect that Li Hao would want her to be the core of this battle instead of Li Hao. Why?"The human King is overbearing, Su Yu is crazy, and I don't want to be controlled by others. No matter who it is, if the three of us were to merge into one, it would be a problem. Tian Fang doesn't understand human nature at all, and the three of us have different wills. The so-called fusion is just a joke! "Unless we completely kill the two of them, we will need one of us to neutralize the power of the three of us. The reason why you have been so strong is to fuse with the power of the three of us. Your clone is the real old body and originally came from the same source. Only you can neutralize the power of the three of us ..."Chunqiu was in a daze. Am I that important?The next moment, three avatars appeared, and Li Hao stepped into them. On the other side, human king and emperor Yu didn't even communicate with Li Hao. They seemed to understand what Li Hao meant, and in an instant, they entered one of the avatars.At this moment, countless clones appeared, all of which were guarded by venerable sovereigns.As for Li Hao, the power of time emerged. Suddenly, his countless clones seemed to be completely connected. It was as if ... The heavenly Daoist temple had connected everyone.Li Hao's voice rang in the ears of the venerable sovereigns.""Listen to my command. It's not impossible to kill Tian Fang! Spring and autumn ... It's all up to you now!"What are you looking at me for?Before she could think further, Li Hao shouted in her ear,""Kill our way over!"In an instant, the chaos great Dao appeared in front of Tian Fang.As for Tian Fang, he was stunned for a moment before he suddenly laughed.He looked at spring and autumn, then at the Black Panther that was still biting, and laughed,""Suddenly ... Such a fusion ... This ... Is this considered lucky?"He was smiling!At this moment, he was smiling very happily. Although it was different from what he had expected, did this also mean that ... The power of time had completely become one?"I didn't expect ... In the end, spring and autumn will combine the strength of the three of you ... Li Hao, are you afraid to face me?""Tian Fang, you'd better take care of yourself!" Li Hao's voice sounded. "Hahaha, good, very good ..."Tian Fang suddenly laughed. Suddenly, the origin of chaos in front of the black leopard began to shrink violently. The endless power of great DAOs from the entire origin of chaos flowed crazily, but at this moment, it entered Tian Fang's body.

The entire chaos seemed to enter a state of Nirvana.Tian Fang's eyes revealed a hint of madness.Nirvana was Nirvana. If he could create absolute spacetime, there was nothing bad about it. If he failed, why should he care about the life and death of others?Kachaa!At this moment, the huge origin of chaos seemed to have completely stopped beating. The entire chaos was eerily quiet.The chaos great Dao was starting to collapse and could no longer be maintained.Two figures appeared. The Black Panther fell to the ground, and beside it was a broken heart. At this moment, it had completely cracked.Tian Fang's aura became stronger and stronger.A large amount of chaotic force surged into spring autumn's body as well.
