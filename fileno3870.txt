At this moment, Spring Autumn, the demon, seemed to have become the main character.Spring and autumn withered and flourished.Chaotic Nirvana! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The power of time also spread over time. Li Hao simply connected with the surroundings and continued to inject chaotic energy into spring Autumn, making it stronger.The space trembled and time passed.On the other side, Tian Fang was overjoyed. This was the result he wanted.This is the absolute balance I want!Time and space criss-crossed!As long as the collision continued, he believed that he would be able to create an absolute space-time.He definitely could!Space was formless, and time was formless.However, at this moment, the two forces continued to cross and collide. Something seemed to have changed. The entire chaos seemed to have disappeared before their eyes. As time and space collided, spring and autumn and Tian Fang seemed to have entered another realm.It was extremely quiet!Tian Fang became even more ecstatic!This was just the beginning. He believed that once he reached the limit, he would be able to continue to open up endless space and time!That was the goal he was chasing after!But soon ... He frowned.Spatial energy continued to erupt from his body, but spring and autumn seemed to be in a bit of trouble, and the power of time seemed to be weakening."Spring and autumn! No, Li Hao!"Tian Fang suddenly roared,"you take the lead!" The Spring and Autumn period had never cultivated the Dao of time. The Dao of withering was also not the Dao of time! She can't even use the true power of time ... You do it!"He seemed to have gone crazy. He could feel the power of spring and autumn, the power of time, slowly weakening.The absolute spacetime that had originally appeared, even if it was just a shadow, he could see hope.But at this moment ... This absolutely still time and space seemed to be collapsing.The chaos that had disappeared seemed to have reappeared. He saw black Panther, Yuan Shuo in the distance, and many other worlds.This shouldn't have happened!Everything should not have been like this.Perhaps, only Li Hao could truly fight him and display the power of time. He could collide with space and create absolute time and space."Li Hao!" Tian Fang was unwilling to give up and roared,"Li Hao!"He was no longer as calm as before.His spatial power became stronger and stronger, as if it was going to jump out of the world. "I've been waiting for you all this time, and all I got was spring and autumn?"Spring Autumn was innocent.The other party looked down on her.She felt that her ability to control time was far inferior to Li Hao 's. At this moment, she couldn't achieve the result he wanted, but ... She had really tried her best.At this moment, it was as if there were ten thousand emperors surrounding the Spring and Autumn period. Li Hao was among them.The human King, Emperor Yu, and Li Hao controlled the power of ten thousand emperors and the power of time, channeling them into spring autumn's body to allow him to continue the battle.Li Hao didn't say anything.At this moment, he was only looking at the gradually weakening power of time.In the beginning, the power of time was indeed very strong.But at this moment, even he felt a little powerless. It wasn't that he was doing this on purpose, but rather ... Time was indeed weakening.A time star appeared between Li Hao's eyebrows again, and the power of time emerged.At this moment, time seemed to be in a mess.Some images and scenes appeared in Li Hao's eyes. He seemed to see many people, the battles from many years ago, the new martial era, the Silver Moon, and the myriad worlds ...The collision continued!They were like two Balls of Fire, constantly colliding in the endless void.He didn't care about what Tian Fang said at all.At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be thinking about something as if he was not involved in this matter. Suddenly, he sent a voice transmission through a time channel."Human King, in your eyes, what is time?""What?"The human King, who was transferring energy, was slightly stunned when he heard this.He, Li Hao, and Su Yu were all from the same source, but they had never shared their perception of the great Dao and avoided talking about time.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly asked her what time was at this critical moment.All of a sudden, the human King was in a daze."Time ... Is life," he said after a long time.Li Hao was stunned.The human King seemed to be recalling something. He smiled, a smile that was different from the past."To me, time is life. It's the path of life. It's about getting old, getting sick, and dying. It's about getting married and having children. It's about studying well. It's about having a harmonious family. It's about being happy and blissful ..."At this moment, Emperor Wan was actually listening.At this moment, they were all a little dazed.The human King in their eyes was extremely overbearing, arrogant, and Savage.At this moment, the human King was saying ... In his eyes, time was only these trivial things in life.The human King sighed once more."That's what time is all about. You have a mischievous little sister, parents who love you, teachers who dote on you, friends who you can play with, and partners who fight with you ... That's time. "It recorded my growth, my success, my failure, and in the end, it was branded into my memories, becoming a part of my life until I die."Li Hao was silent."Su Yu, what do you think Shi Guang is?""Shi Guang ... She's an annoying thing!" Su Yu laughed. Li Hao laughed. Are you scolding me?Or did he really think so?Su Yu chuckled. He didn't show any gentlemanliness, nor was he crazy about giving up on himself. At this moment, he sighed."Shi Guang, perhaps she's a piece of meat-braised meat! Shi Guang might have just taken a nap ... And woken up naturally. Time is perhaps a form of cultural inheritance, the inheritance of civilization ..."

Many things appeared in his mind. He thought of his father's Red braised meat and suddenly felt like eating it.Thinking of the carefree sleep he had after defeating demonic flame, he felt really comfortable.He smiled."Time is to enjoy a moment of peace, tranquility, and freedom after defeating a setback!""Li Hao, what is time in your eyes?"Li Hao was silent.Many things appeared in his mind.What was time?In these limited years, what was there to be nostalgic about ...As he thought about this, he looked into the distance at the shattered origin and said softly,""Perhaps, as you said, time is actually a kind of happiness. I miss the time when I was ignorant ... I miss the relaxed time when my parents were still alive. I miss the time when I played and played with my friends ... I also miss the joy when I achieved the initial success in martial arts ..."He didn't miss the moment when he became powerful and killed everyone.From the moment he became powerful, he had embarked on a path of slaughter. He had slaughtered his way out of Silvermoon, all the way to the heavenstar, all the way to the chaosverse ... He had spent his entire life in slaughter.There were initiative and also passiveness.He was going with the flow, helpless. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He thought of something and suddenly said,"perhaps, time is actually an ordinary thing. Human King, do you still remember the battle? or rather, what was the projection of the battle doing at the last moment?"The human King was stunned for a moment before he nodded."I remember. He returned to his hometown and listened to the sound of reading that existed throughout the land. After that ... He returned home, laid down, and read. Following the sound of reading ... He disappeared."Li Hao sighed.He had died in battle. He had truly died. At this moment, he was certain.He had always been uncertain, but today, he was certain. Thinking back to everything he had seen, the battle ... In the end, he had returned to being ordinary.And war was the origin of the Dao of time.Time ... He had never abandoned it. He had found the true Dao of time, hadn't he?In the mediocrity, it gradually died out.Time, memories, and beauty.As of this moment, he finally understood why his explosive power of time ... Was gradually weakening.He seemed to have sensed something."This isn't my time, nor is it war 's. Perhaps this is just something war abandoned. This isn't his time. This is the Dao, the great Dao. It's not time. Time isn't like this.The human King and Su Yu were also thinking about something. The three of them looked at each other and communicated in silence.He seemed to be thinking about something.Perhaps the three of them had thought of something after hearing Li Hao's words. Only Chunqiu was still focused on the battle with Tian Fang.The power within the three of them was also continuously weakening.Li Hao let out a breath."You two, the real time. I think ... Everyone has some ideas, right?"The human King laughed,"actually ... I'll say something big. I've already understood this a long time ago!" "Of course, it wasn't as clear back then as it is now. After all these years, I've long seen through it! Li Hao, perhaps you're the only one who hasn't seen clearly. You're the only one who's still bound by time!" Su Yu also laughed."I don't really understand. No one is good at bragging, senior Wang. But I do understand Li Hao's meaning now."Li Hao didn't say much. After thinking for a while, he continued,"In other words, time has always been by my side. I had some enlightenment in the past, but it was not as clear as it is today. So ... The real time is not like this! I want to ... Create the real time and completely defeat Tian Fang. Are you two willing to help me?""No, everyone," he suddenly said."Are you all here, venerable sovereigns, willing to help?"Everyone was stunned. What did he mean?How could he help?Li Hao laughed."We don't need to worry about the spring and autumn. We won't die so quickly ... We just need to focus on the energy output. Let's take advantage of the spring and autumn battle and enter the heavenly Daoist sect to have some fun!"Everyone was stunned!What time was this?This is the decisive battle between spring and autumn and Tian Fang. This is the point of choice for everyone's fate. What ... Are you saying?Li Hao didn't care. At this moment, a world seemed to appear in Spring autumn's body, and passages appeared in front of everyone."Come in!""By the way, don't substitute the energy. Even if you bring it in, bring less in case fellow Daoist Spring Autumn gets killed ..."Everyone was dumbfounded!However, at this moment, the human King and Su Yu entered one after another. The others felt a headache when they saw this. But when they thought about how these three were not afraid ... What were they afraid of?In the next moment, the spirits of the venerable sovereigns merged into it.The power of the great Dao was left behind.As for the spring Autumn Emperor, he was still fighting against Tian Fang. Tian Fang was like a mad demon, roaring madly.As for spring and autumn ... He was having a splitting headache."Li Hao! What do we do?"There was no response."Human King, are you there?" she roared in her heart again."Su Yu, where are you?"Is He Dead?She was a little exasperated!Why is no one responding to me?At this moment, she could sense that her spirituality seemed to have weakened a lot, but she really did not have the time to investigate carefully. The power of her great Dao was continuously being released, but the more she fought, the weaker she became.If this continued ... She would definitely lose!Li Hao, you bastard, why aren't you answering me?She felt very guilty!Without Li Hao's command, she felt that she was definitely no match for Tian Fang. These bastards, why should I be in charge? why?……The heavenly Daoist sect.

It was a barren land.Li Hao turned his head to look at the human King."The materialization of spiritual power will eventually become real. Right?"The human King nodded."So, your mcmau is your inner world. In fact ... It can really exist."The human King nodded again.Li Hao then looked at Su Yu."Your spirit sea includes your infinite worlds. So ... When you walked out of the infinite worlds, you actually took them into your spirit sea!" Su Yu also nodded slightly.Li Hao understood.Behind him, the venerable sovereigns were all confused. Li Hao looked at the crowd and suddenly said,""Everyone, do you think I'm happier during the ordinary times, or later on, when I became king and ancestor?"Everyone was at a loss for words.Li Hao smiled."I want to ... Create chaos here. The chaos of the mind. I want to ... Completely ordinary this chaos!" No more myriad DAOs system, no more Dao cultivation system, let time return to its ordinary state!"Everyone was stunned and then stunned."What do the two of you think?" Li Hao looked at human king and emperor Yu.The human King laughed,"I knew you would have such thoughts. I have no objections. Time is ordinary in the first place. In the end, we have returned to reality and life! Life, aging, sickness, and death, there's no need to be demanding. A hundred years is life, ten thousand years ... Is just living!""As early as the neo martial era, I once thought of ... Destroying martial arts!"The human King was somewhat emotional."If I hadn't discovered that there are still worlds beyond the chaos, new martial arts, and danger, I think ... I might have continued to do it and finally turned new martial arts into ordinary things!"Su Yu laughed as well."Perhaps returning to being ordinary is the true meaning of time. I think he might have completely understood everything at the last moment!" Tian Fang pursues the so-called absolute space-time. In my opinion ... It's actually very similar! There's not much difference in what we're pursuing. "Li Hao also nodded,"so ... I want to resurrect everyone I want to resurrect!" I will rebuild my Silver Moon world and let everyone appear again. Everything will return to normal. The entire chaos will return to normal ... Be it humans, demons, conflicts, or hegemony ... If they should exist, they should exist. Perhaps some people might not agree with me, but that's fine ... I'm not demanding, everyone agrees!"Li Hao looked at Su Yu and the others and said with a smile,""Then I ... Want to rebuild chaos here, a new chaos, built with will, built with spirit ... Finally, I will cover the chaos and let time ... Return completely!"The few of them looked at each other and nodded. At this moment, the human Emperor revealed a smile."That's fine too. Actually, I hope that I can have some peace and quiet. That way, I can have more time to accompany some people. My lover, my friends, my brothers ..."At this moment, the human King waved his hand, and a city appeared in the heavenly Daoist sect. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  That was ... Mcmau city.At this moment, there seemed to be countless shadows emerging. They were all neo martial artists, but they seemed to have lost their consciousness. The human King did not care. He looked at them and smiled,""Are you guys going to be my next-door neighbors, or ... Should we stay away from each other? If they were far away now, they might not have the chance to visit each other again in the future. They might not have the chance to meet again in this life! Of course, if we become neighbors ... We can join in the fun. "Su Yu laughed first."As your neighbor, the king of humans ... You wouldn't come to our place to visit us and fight for nothing, would you?"The human King sneered,"do you think I'm that bored?" Besides, what was the point of fighting when that time came? I'm a refined man, I'll convince people with reason!"Su Yu laughed.Li Hao also laughed,"let's be neighbors!" It's too far away, and we might not even have the chance to meet again in our entire lives. Let's forge it first. As for the personnel ... We'll wait until we defeat Tian Fang and return to the origin of chaos!"The two of them nodded.At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns were looking at each other. Someone couldn't help but say,""The three Dao Masters mean to ... Destroy the Dao?"He shuddered in fear!How could it be like this!Li Hao shook his head."It's not destroying the Dao. It's just restoring chaos to its original state. The Dao can be comprehended in the heart!" The pugilistic world is still here, and time has returned to normal ..."The human King grinned,"why are you being so reserved?" In general, you are right. Time is ordinary, including the absolute time and space that Tian Fang pursued. In my opinion, in the end, what he pursued was also ordinary!"He seemed to have guessed Tian Fang's ultimate goal. In fact, absolute spacetime was nothing more than ordinary."In this place, use the spirit to create chaos! Using will to create a world! While chaos is completely destroyed, we can project Chaos and destroy all DAOs. Now, we can resurrect whoever we want ..."The human King chuckled."What Li Hao is thinking is actually what I'm thinking. It's also what everyone at the peak is thinking!" The chaos was constantly in conflict and turmoil. Everything originated from extraordinariness! "Perhaps this won't be able to completely resolve all disputes, but in my opinion ... The next time may be countless years later. By then, you and I will both be dead. Why should we care?""Actually, everyone doesn't have a choice. If you don't choose ... The only option is ... Death!" He added.He looked at the others, and Li Hao nodded.""We can't beat Tian Fang! Even if we gather everyone's strength, we can't defeat Tian Fang. We can only turn the entire chaos into ordinary people ..."

At this point, he laughed. At this moment, his laughter was suddenly a little presumptuous and arrogant."There were over ten thousand of us, and he was the only one ... At that time ... We could punch him so hard that he would call everyone 'mom and dad'!"Everyone was stunned. The human King chuckled,""Call me Grandpa!"“……”Everyone was speechless. You're still joking at a time like this?"Dao Masters, do you mean that this is the only way to turn the chaos into nothingness and ... Kill Tian Fang?" a venerable sovereign asked hesitantly.Li Hao sighed, I don't necessarily have to kill him ... Of course, we'll see when the time comes! "However, this is the only path. I can't beat him. The time I control is only a great Dao, but it's not strong enough. At this moment, I can't fight against Tian Fang! Spring and autumn might be able to hold on for a while, but ... He won't be able to hold on for too long!"At this moment, everyone understood what Li Hao meant.Or, wait for death.If not, they could only listen to him and turn the entire chaos into nothingness. The 10000 DAOs would be completely destroyed and there would no longer be 10000 DAOs. At that time, everyone would lose the power of their great DAOs, including Tian Fang!At that time, it would no longer be based on strength, but ... The number of people!Whoever had more people would be more powerful.Over 10,000 people, one mouthful of saliva from each person, even Tian Fang would drown.Li Hao didn't say anything else. At this moment, a small city appeared in front of him. It was Silver City.All the buildings seemed real.In everyone's eyes, it was just a small model, but soon, this model began to expand and spread out. Some familiar cities and places gradually began to appear, gradually connecting with the not-so-far neo martial.Emperor Yu also laughed. With a wave of his hand, divine runes fell onto the ground one after another, and buildings rose up from thin air.Seeing this, everyone recalled what Li Hao had said ... They had no choice but to choose.Even if some of them were unwilling, they could only take action at this moment. Suddenly, cities rose from the ground. Some of them were not even cities, but wastelands, deserts, lakes ...At this moment, everyone was building their own world and their own ideal country. They might not succeed, but they knew that they could only trust Li Hao and his friends.They had no choice!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly thought of something. A great Dao appeared under his feet. Suddenly, the billions of people seemed to see something.Li Hao smiled."Everyone, perhaps ... You can feel the will of the common people! The world wasn't one person's world, and chaos wasn't one person's chaos. Perhaps, it would only be meaningful if everyone participated! "Of course, we don't have to listen to all of them. This might be the only privilege we have ever had since we started cultivating ..."Everyone looked at each other. A moment later, their wills merged into it and they felt the will of the common people.At that moment, the countless worlds and living beings in the destructive chaos seemed to have sensed something. To make the chaos ... Return to normal?At that moment ... All the living beings became excited!In today's battle, they were terrified, uneasy, and desperate ...This was because everything was no longer under control.The entire world seemed to be on the verge of collapse. They were filled with despair. At this moment, they didn't know if what they felt was real or fake. However, they seemed to have seen hope.In an instant, countless consciousnesses spread out along the path of the martial world, along the will of despair, and along the heart gate. All the venerable sovereigns were sensing it in silence. Some sensed their own world, some sensed other worlds, and made adjustments. Li Hao sensed everything, too, and continued to carve his Silver Moon.At the side, be it the human King or Emperor Yu, they were all very seriously building the world that belonged to them.At this moment, he was very sincere and serious.The human King was no longer frivolous, Emperor Yu no longer pretended to be gentle, and everyone tore off their hypocritical masks and did what they wanted to do.……In the outside world.Spring Autumn was going crazy.With a loud bang, she was sent flying back while coughing up blood. On the other side, Tian Fang seemed to have gone completely mad as he roared,""Why? Spring and autumn, you can't use the power of time at all! Time couldn't be this weak! You piece of trash, your time has disappointed me!"It wasn't like this!It definitely wasn't like this.This was not Shi Guang. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  'I know Zhan, I've seen him, I've chatted with him. The time he's talking about is very powerful, so powerful that it's ... Unbelievable!'I believe you!He really believed it.For countless years, in my eyes, time has been unparalleled. That's why I'm afraid of being resurrected in battle. That's why I'm afraid that I'm no match for him. That's why I hope that Li Hao can take charge. That way, even if time is invincible, I can still win!But now?He was extremely disappointed by the time that spring and autumn controlled.Chunqiu was also furious,'old man, are you done with your madness? You're strong, so whatever you say goes. That's how time is!"This is too much!This is too much.Shi Guang is already very strong, but I'm weaker than you. What more do you want?Must I kill you to prove that time is powerful?If I could kill you, I would've killed you long ago!You old man, you're pissing me off!"No, that's not right ..."Tian Fang shook his head furiously."That's definitely not the case. In the past, it was said that time was incomparably powerful. Even space had no way of resisting time!"He muttered to himself as he recalled the past."That's not right. He said that time and space will eventually exist. In other words, time and space will be very powerful. That's right. Absolute time and space are the most powerful and eternal existence ..."

Spring Autumn cursed in his heart!Crazy!Fighting a sixth level venerable sovereign, do you really take everything he says seriously?If people say you want to die, do you really want to die?It was one thing for this old man to be crazy, but more importantly, he was really strong.Also, what was Li Hao doing?He didn't make a sound or reply. The power of his great Dao was still there, but it was slowly weakening. If this continued ... He really couldn't take it anymore!Just as she was in despair, Li Hao's voice suddenly rang in her ear.""I Almost Forgot About You. Spring and autumn, what's your ideal city of spring and autumn like?""What the hell?"Chunqiu almost exploded in anger!What the hell?They were f * cking fighting!He was fighting the old monster chaos!'I've been beating you to death for you. I've almost exploded. What are you doing now?'In his anger, he ignored them.Li Hao, however, was like an annoying fly.""Spring and autumn, tell me quickly. You've also contributed greatly, and I won't forget anyone. Tell me, what do you want the spring and autumn clan and the spring and autumn realm to be? At the very least, make a general request ...""Li Hao!" Spring autumn's roar resounded through the heavens. At this moment, he was even more enraged than Tian Fang. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  I'm fighting!I'm fighting against Tian Fang.Come up with some ideas on how to deal with him, that's the key ..."Right, if you tell us, it'll be beneficial for us to kill Tian Fang ..."F * ck you!Do I look like an idiot?Spring Autumn cursed in his heart!So, I can kill Tian Fang just by saying a few words? even if you tease a child, you don't dare to do this, right?But Li Hao kept asking, and she was really angry."Fine, you're giving up, right?"Then I don't care anymore!"As long as my spring and autumn clan can gain wisdom and live a little longer, like everyone else, like all other living beings, can have wisdom ... Anything is fine, right?""No problem! I see, the request is simple ... Oh, do you want to be my neighbor?""Get lost!"Spring and autumn Fury!Go to hell!Neighbor my ass. If you die, I don't want to die with you.It was too demonic!At this moment, he didn't care about spring and autumn anymore. If you guys don't care about life and death, why should I care?The lifespan of the spring and autumn clan was short to begin with.To live for one spring and autumn was considered longevity.How long have I lived? What about you guys?Bah!If there's anyone who's going to regret it, it's you guys. I don't regret it!At this moment, she snorted."Tian Fang, you old bastard. I'll kill you. You two-million-year-old thing. Go to hell!"At this moment, she was completely free!I don't care!At most, I'll fight until I die. I'm not the only one who will die anyway. BOOM!The power of his great DAOs surged madly. At this moment, he didn't care about the protracted battle at all. He unleashed his full power and fought as long as he could!……In the heavenly Daoist sect.Li Hao laughed. At this moment, a huge city appeared out of thin air and approached the infinite worlds. Su Yu turned around and saw Li Hao laughing."Spring and autumn is a little loli, and so is myriad world blue sky ... Spring and autumn have countless avatars, and so is blue sky ... I think it would be more appropriate to be your neighbor."“……”Su Yu looked at him without saying a word.What demons and ghosts? is it appropriate for you to send them to my vicinity?Li Hao's smile relaxed."When he successfully transcended into a mortal, he shouldn't be too crazy. Besides, Spring Autumn isn't very smart. It's not a big problem for you.""Why don't you get closer to the Silver Moon?"Li Hao chuckled."Silver Moon is a normal person. There aren't many freaks. Be it neo martial arts or myriad world, there are too many who cultivate the clone Dao ..."Are you saying that you, Silver Moon, aren't a pervert?""You, Silver Moon, aren't you the biggest pervert?" the human King turned around and sneered.“……”Li Hao was a little displeased, but he quickly recovered his smile.""Senior might not know this, but I've never been that kind of person. What I told you that day was not false. In the past, I was the chief patrol of the inspection Division, which is what you call a police officer and a Constable ... I helped many people and collected countless silk banners. It's a pity that the war broke out and caused the silk banner to be burned. Now ... There's only one silk banner left!"He sighed regretfully. At this moment, a silk banner appeared with the words "Xi Xi is willing to help others and is full of love."Gifted to patrol inspector Li Hao of the inspection Division.As soon as the silk banner appeared, everyone was stunned. This ... Seemed to be real. It was already damaged, and not only that, there were some bloodstains on it.This fellow had really been given a silk banner before?Both the human King and Su Yu were stunned. How could this be?Where did he get it from?Seeing everyone looking at him, Li Hao smiled and said,"it's just a necessity in life. Otherwise, who would be willing to be a bad person?" The devil sword Li Hao is just a rumor in the martial world. Too many people have received my favor ..."After saying this, he placed the flag into the Silver Moon world."Let's keep it as a memento. In the past, such banners could be piled up into a mountain. Today, there's only one left. "The human King glanced at him. You're lying!Even this side of him might have been cheated.As for Su Yu, he suddenly burst out laughing. Li Hao looked at him, and Su Yu coughed lightly."I'm fine, I'm fine ... It's just that ... This blood seems to have been sprayed on by a dead person ... It seems that someone was killed near this banner back then. Could it be that the person who gave the banner was killed by senior time?""What?""How can you measure your senior with such a dirty heart?" Li Hao frowned.Su Yu shrugged and smiled without saying anything.I guessed it!

Chapter 3875 The Martial Arts World Is In My Heart (The End)_6
Generally speaking, my guesses have never been wrong.It was very likely!The human King also thought of this. He smiled and ignored Li Hao. At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns were appeased by the calmness of the three. They were actually talking and laughing at this moment.Everyone felt much more at ease. "By the way, what do you plan to do after you become a mortal?" Li Hao asked."I haven't decided yet. Teacher?" the human King laughed. Be the principal? Or should he just make a small island and live a life of retirement? Or ... Give a speech?"He chuckled."Alright, I actually have an idea ... I'll be a landlord and a debt collector. I have almost a mountain of IOUs in my hands. If I successfully transcended into a mortal, I'll go collect all the debts. At the same time, I'll travel around. Perhaps ... It'll be a different experience!"Li Hao couldn't help but laugh.Su Yu smiled."I'll probably open a civilization Research Institute and collect the culture, knowledge, and inheritance of all civilizations. The Tao may disappear, but civilization won 't. It will only become more brilliant in time!"Li Hao nodded.The two of them looked at him. Li Hao thought for a moment and chuckled.""I want to be a Martial Master!"The two of them were stunned.Li Hao laughed,"Martial Master? you don't have to be the current Martial Master, or ... Open a martial arts school?" It's not bad to strengthen one's body. My five birds technique is very powerful, and it's a technique to strengthen one's body. It doesn't mean that one has to kill ..."He was a little emotional."Perhaps I still want to finish my studies, or continue to be an inspector and protect the peace of the country? I don't know. I haven't thought about it yet. I might be very happy and comfortable living like this ... I can also stay in the martial world in my heart. It's not bad to have a martial world dream ..."The three of them discussed and talked.The lake Road was too tiring.And this was not the martial world that they had been pursuing.At this moment, the human King was thinking of his wife and children, raising a cat and a dog, and collecting debts everywhere. He couldn't help but feel happy.As for Su Yu, he also thought that it would be interesting to collect the civilizations of all races ... No, now it should be collecting the civilizations of chaos.Who said that Dao could only be used for killing?The smiles on their faces came from the bottom of their hearts. Influenced by them, the venerable sovereigns began to whisper to each other.It was a little noisy."What are you going to do in the future? If he really transcended into a mortal, what would everyone do?""I want to be an actor!""What's an actor?""It's an actress, understand? I know this. Is this what you mean?""Bullsh * t, what actor ... Forget it, you're right. It's just to act out some real legends and make them into movies. There are too many things in this chaos that are worth filming. Legends ... Never end!""That sounds good!""What do you want to do?""I want to be a Bandit!""What?" "Be the King of the Mountain, understand? There are many mountains in our place, and the King of the Mountains. It's very nourishing. Sometimes, I'm envious of them ...""No, I want to be the king of all beasts ... I'll go around and get some demons. Dragons and phoenixes, I'll have them all as my grandsons ...""You're quite bold ...""What are you afraid of? They've already transcended to the mortal realm, so the dragon and phoenix are only ordinary. They might even be the size of pheasants!"“……”Everyone suddenly laughed and started to build their own homes.Perhaps, there was still some unwillingness and unwillingness.However, when the three omnipotent experts were discussing what they would do after they transcended into mortals ... Even if they were unwilling, they could only let go of their dissatisfaction. Perhaps ... Transcendent mortal was a better way out.Everyone discussed with each other, as if they had forgotten the disputes and troubles of the outside world.At this moment, the chaos seemed to be listening to everything. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  A smile suddenly appeared on some people's faces, as if ... They had seen the light of the future. At this moment, even if the world was still shaking, mountains were collapsing, the earth was cracking, and the world was dying ...However, they all had smiles on their faces.It turned out that these powerhouses were only mortals.Ordinary people!But why ... Was it that as he listened, he felt a little envious, a little excited, and a little eager?At this moment, everyone in the world knew. Perhaps, only the two people who were still fighting in the outside world didn't know. The entire Primal Chaos seemed to have heard their discussion. Primal Chaos turning into mortals!At this moment, countless willpower poured into these spiritual structures. It was as if everyone was looking forward to it.Li Hao smiled!He was happy to be able to connect the power of despair to everyone and allow them to participate. Even if they couldn't change their fate, they would at least have the right to know how their fate would lead them.In the end ... At this moment, at least 90% of the people in the chaotic world supported him.They supported everyone's decision.Transcendent mortal!Let time, let chaos, let everything return to normal.Countless wills were fused into the illusory world created by those experts. At this moment, those living beings were filled with anticipation. They might not be able to decide the specific details, but at least they knew what their future would be like.We ... Know!We are about to witness all of this. We will witness the end of the chaos and the transformation of time into mortals."We know that there was once a group of people who stood at the peak of chaos.In the end, they all walked towards the ordinary.Perhaps, a few years later, the new generation would not believe it at all. So what?

Chapter 3876 Jianghu Is In My Heart (Finale)(7)
All the miracles and legends might disappear in the long river of history with the passage of time. However, their generation, their generation of living beings, had all witnessed it!He had witnessed the myths and legends, and ... Decided his own future and destiny!"Even if we're not the leaders, at least we're no longer completely ignorant.At this moment, countless will power gushed into the heavenly Daoist Rite.……Outside.Tian Fang was suddenly stunned as if he felt something. He stepped on Spring Autumn and looked around. The entire chaos had already been destroyed and had no source of life.However, at this moment ... It was as if a special wave was sweeping over!As he felt and experienced it, a hint of confusion appeared in his eyes.What was this?He actually didn't feel it!Anticipation?Hope?Desire?What was this?"Li Hao, what are you doing now? You don't dare to face me?"Tian Fang roared!What did you do? p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Why did the entire chaos seem to come to life again? he looked into the distance at the shattered origin of chaos and revealed a puzzled expression. The origin of chaos ... Had originally been in a state of utter destruction. The power of great DAOs and life force had almost been completely drained.However, at this moment ... It seemed ... There were also some faint fluctuations.The feeling of coming back to life!Why was it like this?He felt a little uneasy and confused.The stomp on Spring Autumn was excruciatingly painful. Spring Autumn roared and countless destructive forces appeared on his body, spreading along the other party's foot. Spring Autumn fled in an instant and was also furious. "You're finished. Li Hao and the others are thinking of ways to kill you ... Tian Fang, you old lunatic, you're dead!"Tian Fang's expression turned ugly. He looked at Spring Autumn."Summon Li Hao!""Where's your clone?""They ... Where are they?"Those people seemed to have disappeared just like that. However, Spring Autumn should be able to summon them. After all, they were all in her clone."In your dreams!"Chun Qiu sneered and instantly fled,"just wait for your death!"She was just threatening him. At this moment, she was no match for Tian Fang. She couldn't appear in absolute time and space.Tian Fang was clearly flustered and exasperated. If this continued, he would really be beaten to death.In the surroundings, there were still countless special energies that spread out.Tian Fang sensed it silently, his eyes changing constantly.Li Hao was definitely their doing.The countless living beings around him seemed to have seen and heard something. He was the only one who didn't feel anything. Why?Why was it like this?What were they trying to do? He caught up to Spring Autumn in an instant. Perhaps, they would only appear after he completely destroyed Spring Autumn. Li Hao, I don't believe that you'll keep hiding like this!……In the heavenly Daoist sect.At this moment, an incomparably huge world, a new chaos, emerged.The bright Kasaya!At this moment, it seemed to have come alive.Civilization emerged.There were countless cities with different styles. Some of them were not quite consistent. There were demon race cities, some were in the wilderness, some were in the desert, some were in the ancient style, some were in the modern style ...There were all kinds of buildings.Some were connected, some were scattered in different places, some worlds were next to each other, and some cities were connected ...One after another!At that moment, countless wills poured into the illusory chaos and began to stabilize it.Li Hao revealed a brilliant smile!He didn't know if he could succeed or not. He didn't know if his understanding of the Dao and time was correct or not. Perhaps only fighting could give him an answer.However, Zhan had already died. He had died from an ordinary life.Perhaps ... He would only know if he tried.At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns were all very uneasy. The outside world seemed to be in a violent turmoil."An illusory chaos can really ... Cover the original chaos and turn everything ... Into a mortal?"Initially, he was a little unwilling.However, when they sensed Tian Fang's power, and the turbulence of spring and autumn, they ... Began to feel apprehensive.If they didn't succeed, everyone would die.It was better to live than to die!Transcendent mortal was still better than death, right?"I don't know."Li Hao shook his head."No one knows if it's possible or not. But I think that all the living beings in the chaos acknowledge and agree with it. Dao is also cultivated by living beings! In my opinion, the power of will will definitely be stronger than the power of a great Dao!""The so-called space ... Space is also the place where we live. It belongs to everyone, not a single person. When everything becomes ordinary, space will no longer belong to one person! This space, the place to live, is for all of us ...""As long as everyone believes in it, I believe ... We can succeed!" Li Hao smiled.Hearing his words, the crowd no longer said anything. Li Hao exhaled and said,"let's go. It's time to go out!" Is Tian Fang's absolute spacetime even more powerful than Hundun 's?"Then, Li Hao walked out first.The others followed him out one after another.……"Li Hao!"Tian Fang was still growling when his eyes suddenly twitched. At this moment, shadows appeared one after another. In an instant, Li Hao appeared in front of him. Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn was covered in blood and injuries.Seeing the crowd appear, his eyes were filled with resentment and depression.He was finally out!You bunch of bastards, if you don't come out, I'll be beaten to death by Tian Fang!

"Tian Fang, do you know what I'm doing?" Li Hao took a deep breath.Tian Fang stopped, but he didn't immediately attack Li Hao. Instead, he looked at Li Hao, who smiled and said,""Right now, in the primordial chaos, perhaps ... You are the only one who doesn't know. Do you know why?"Tian Fang coldly looked at him."Because ... You have never been in despair!""What?" Tian Fang's heart jolted as he said in a low voice,"you mean ... What did you do through the heart gate, which is also your path of despair?""Yes."So that was how it was!Tian Fang frowned,'all of this is meaningless! What do you think these mortals can help you with? You're absorbing the power of will, right? Would it work? Spacetime was the strongest power! Only time can defeat me!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "I know!"With his hands behind his back, Li Hao said calmly,""Then how do you know that time has nothing to do with will and the common people?"Tian Fang frowned slightly.Li Hao smiled."You think that you're invincible in space, but I don't think that you're truly invincible. Tianfang, you've always wanted to create an absolute space-time. I'll satisfy you and use the real power of time. Are you ... Willing to try?""Real time?"Tian Fang was stunned and looked at him. What did he mean?"The power of time from before ...""That's only on the outside!"Li Hao shook his head,"that's not Shi Guang, at least not the Shi Guang in my eyes!" I don't think that was the power of time. It could be considered a kind of power to reverse time, a power to allow memories to appear, a power to create illusions ... In my eyes, that is not considered time!"That wasn't shi Guang?An explosion sounded in Tian Fang's mind!That was impossible!How was that possible?Tian Fang looked at Li Hao and became even crazier. "You're saying that it's not time and that you've cultivated the true power of time?""Yes,""I want to see it!""That's the time left behind by the battle. How can it not be?" Li Hao, are you more talented than a fighter? I don't believe it! You're just trying to intimidate me!""No need to threaten!"At this moment, Li Hao shook his head and thought, at this point, do I still need to scare you? There was no need! Today, there will be a winner between you and me. At this point, all the threats are just a joke!"Tian Fang couldn't believe it. He looked at him for a long time before saying in a low voice,""I want to see ... What real time is!"He wanted to see!He didn't believe that the power of time he had always believed in was fake.That was impossible.In his opinion, it was only because Chunqiu did not know how to use it that it was so powerful. Otherwise, it would not be so weak.At this moment, the heavenly Daoist Rite appeared. Tian Fang instantly frowned!He recognized this thing. Are you kidding me? this is Shi Guang?Li Hao looked at him and suddenly extended his hand. In the distance, the shattered origin of chaos suddenly appeared and fell into the heavenly Daoist Rite. Tian Fang did not stop it. The origin of chaos was useless.Without the power of great DAOs and the power of life, he was just trash.He didn't mind if Li Hao took it.He only wanted to see ... What was Shi Guang's motive?At this moment, the shattered origin of chaos suddenly absorbed the power of countless wills and integrated them into the heavenly Daoist Rite.In the heavenly Daoist Rite, the chaos formed by the convergence of countless worlds seemed to see light at this moment. The origin of chaos gradually rotated, and the original split origin suddenly split into two.Yin and yang, light and darkness.It was like the light of the sun and the moon, but also like the light of yin and yang.Light and darkness began to intertwine.The entire illusory chaos began to change. Countless wills merged into it, and countless people acknowledged this world, this chaos.At this moment, Li Hao, who was holding the heavenly Daoist Rite, seemed to have sensed something.At this moment, he seemed to understand how the origin of chaos was formed.This thing did not seem to be man-made. Or rather, it was ... Something that everyone and all living beings looked forward to. It was something that was born in the previous era. They looked forward to the appearance of the great Dao.That was why there was chaos today?He didn't know if that was the case, but he could feel that the entire heavenly Daoist Rite seemed to have been given life.In fact, Tian Fang had also felt it a little.At this moment, his eyes were constantly changing.He didn't move or stop her. He just wanted to see the Shi Guang that Li Hao was talking about. At this moment, he was even looking forward to it. Looking at the heavenly Daoist sect, he licked his lips and smiled."This ... Seems interesting!"Li Hao seemed to have revived the origin of chaos!It also seemed like something had changed.Were there really other powers of time?"Come on!"Next to him, countless streams of spatial energy began to congregate, once more exuding a powerful aura that shook the world. But at this moment, the world seemed to have come alive.Countless worlds and countless living beings were looking up! Everyone's faces were filled with anticipation and hope that they ... Would succeed in transcending to the mortal realm!Time would eventually triumph over space.Li Hao exhaled, and a long black sword appeared in his hand. The power of desire poured into the heavenly Daoist sect. There was no need to suppress anything. Only with desire could there be motivation.The entire heavenly Daoist Rite seemed to have transformed into a special force at this moment. It surged into the long sword and it began to tremble even more."Tianfang ... Today, Li Hao was no match for you. I'm no match for you. But now, I'm not alone ..."

"Cut the crap!""I don't care!" Tian Fang shouted angrily. Li Hao, you know that I don't care about this. You know what I want. I want an answer and a result!"At this moment, an invisible sword appeared in front of him, and countless spatial power surged into it. He was a little excited, a little excited, and a little crazy. He really felt threatened!It was much more threatening than the Spring and Autumn period!Perhaps, the timing of the battle was really wrong.Or perhaps, Li Hao's time was even stronger.And this is what I've been looking forward to.Wasn't it?"Come on!"Tian Fang howled and raised his arm. At this moment, he had gathered almost all of his strength. His blood and Qi were burning wildly and his anger was surging to his head!Li Hao's long hair was dancing in the wind. The entire chaos was silent.Everyone was waiting for the result.Li Hao laughed. He waved his sword and slashed!At that moment, it was as if chaos had descended between heaven and earth. Countless worlds floated in all directions like phantoms and merged with their willpower.At this moment, the entire Primal Chaos began to shake.Countless worlds rapidly began to gather!Tremble!Turbulence!The power of countless great DAOs was suddenly annihilated and disappeared.A sun and a moon seemed to have appeared in the sky.All the power of the great DAOs was rapidly dissipating, being devoured, annihilated, and exhausted. The power of the great DAOs in everyone's body was dissipating madly and began to merge with those worlds, creating an illusory world that had just been created.The invisible sword in Tian Fang's hand suddenly started to break.It seemed to have instantly worn out all the power of the great Dao!Tian Fang was stunned. He looked at Li Hao in a daze. Impossible, this is impossible. How could this be?I, Hundun, am invincible!'Why ... Is the power of my great Dao and my power of space rapidly flowing away?'"Li Hao! You're cheating!""I let you have your way again and again," he roared."I waited for you again and again just to see the real time and the absolute time and space. Why did you lie to me ..."The long sword fell from the sky!It was as if he had split the entire chaos, as if he had split all the darkness.Tian Fang's hair was disheveled, and his eyes were filled with despair.Why was it like this?The power of space was incomparably powerful. How could it be no match for this unique power? this was not time ...Flowing time was not like this!What else could surpass the power of time?Despair! When despair erupted, he was stunned for a moment. A door seemed to have appeared in his heart, and some things seemed to have emerged. It was as if ... At this moment, he had heard something.Transcendent mortal!At this moment, he knew what this special force was! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Transcendent mortal!Time returned to normal?He looked at Li Hao and everyone else in a daze. He was somewhat absent-minded and in a trance ..."Impossible ... It can't be ... Li Hao ... You're lying to me ..."The scene from a million years ago appeared in his mind.That day, he met a person in Tian Fang.On that day, they discussed the heavenly Dao and proposed the idea of absolute spacetime. On that day, they said that absolute spacetime might exist. However, later on, they said that when absolute spacetime appeared, everything might end.What was the meaning of the battle that day?Was the time he was talking about his time?He had always felt that fighting was an escape. He was unwilling to face himself and The Collapse of Chaos.But today ... He seemed to have understood a little.The battle ... Returned to being ordinary.He did not commit suicide!He had just ... Died a normal death.Tian Fang looked at Li Hao in a daze. At this moment, the entire chaos trembled violently, and countless great DAOs were being destroyed!Li Hao took advantage of this moment and waved his hand. A special power of origin appeared between heaven and earth. He suddenly ignored Tian Fang and chased after him!He chased after chaos!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be overjoyed. He crazily chased after the small world in the distance!Behind him, the Black Panther quickly gave chase. Yuan Shuo laughed and stammered, then chased after it madly!At this moment, the human King also grinned and laughed. He flew towards the distant neo martial arts land. There were some staggered steps under his feet, but he was extremely happy. He saw countless neo martial artists beginning to revive in the neo martial arts land.Su Yu also flew toward the infinite worlds with a smile. The power of the great Dao on his body was being annihilated and dissipated."Let's go!"At this moment, a venerable sovereign laughed and said,"if we don't leave now, the power of our great DAOs will be completely destroyed. We will fall to our deaths!" Hahaha ... I've successfully transcended into a mortal ... Hahaha ... My world, I'm here!"The group of venerable sovereigns flew away in all directions.At this moment, only two people remained motionless.Tian Fang looked on in a daze, while Spring Autumn was at a loss. What was going on?With just one sword, chaos seemed to have undergone a drastic change!"Li Hao ... What's wrong?"She roared loudly,"my power is rapidly depleting. Li Hao, Tian Fang is still alive! Li Hao...Where are you going?"What are you doing!Where are you guys going?The battle isn't over yet. Tian Fang is still alive, but my power is being devoured by an invisible force and is being destroyed!Li Hao, you bastard!

In front of him, the sky was in a daze as he looked down. Countless worlds were frantically reorganizing!He stared blankly, his hair disheveled, and the Space Force in his body was rapidly flowing away. He looked at all of this and muttered,"Absolute spacetime, what exactly is it? is it like this? Who can tell me ... Is this ... Absolute time and space?"The world had changed.This chaos was undergoing a violent change.The great Dao was being destroyed.Everything had changed. Billions of living beings seemed to be cheering, roaring, and jumping for joy!They had survived!On the other side, Chun Qiu couldn't care less. At this moment, she could feel the endless energy in her body rapidly dissipating. She quickly chased in the direction that Li Hao and the others had run in. She seemed to see ... A world.A world that belongs to me!The realm of spring and autumn!She seemed to hear the chirping of countless cicadas. She quickly ran in that direction and cursed,"I don't know what's wrong with you, why are you all crazy?"Had the entire chaos gone crazy?In the endless void.Tian Fang looked down in a daze. He looked at those worlds and at the countless living beings jumping for joy. It was as if ... He was truly happy.Why so? p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Invincible power and endless longevity, aren't these what you all seek?At this moment, he fell, allowing the power to dissipate and the force of the fall to drag him underground. He looked at the sky, at the origin of chaos that looked like the sun and moon, as if ... He was watching a battle.Their first encounter a million years ago was today's ending?Zhan, you're dead ... But I'm still alive.But I ... I think I'm dying too.Today, I've lost two million years of my life. Perhaps, I'm the person who has lived the longest in the chaos.……At this moment, Li Hao was flying toward a city.His power was dissipating.He didn't care!"He was incomparably happy. He was incomparably excited. I can feel it. I can feel it ... That familiar aura."Dad, mom ... Xiao Yuan ... And everyone else ..."He screamed and roared madly as if he had returned to the past!Silver City. On a road, a middle-aged man and woman were at a loss. They were listening to the crazy shouts and exclamations nearby. They were extremely confused.What's wrong?Are you all crazy?Also, we were in a car accident. How can we be fine?The couple looked at each other, both at a loss. Not far away, a young man was trembling in fear and also at a loss. I ... Didn't I die?Where's ah Hao?How was he?He raised his head and heard countless cheers that exploded in his heart!"Silver Moon King!""Silver Moon King!"“……”Silver Moon King?Wasn't this the astronomical calendar? Where did this Silver Moon King come from?He did not erase anyone's memories. Everyone heard, saw, and felt it, including the silvers.They knew that their King had won!At this moment, there seemed to be more people around them. Some were confused, some were afraid, and some were terrified ...Some people were cheering crazily, while others were at a loss.Some people threw their heads back and roared, while others ... Saw powerful beings of the past falling from the sky, some even falling!He was in a sorry state!In the silver Blizzard city, the middle-aged man and woman looked at the sky in a daze and muttered,"Honey, someone ... Is falling from the sky!""Nonsense ..."The woman's head ached from the noise, but she couldn't help but look up. What she saw stunned her. One figure after another seemed to fall from the sky. She even vaguely saw a familiar face!Why does he look so much like my son?"Mom, dad!""Little Yuan!"The roar spread out.At this moment, the shouting seemed to have stopped, and countless Silvermoon people turned to look in one direction.In the sky, experts were falling one after another.The invincible strength of the past seemed to have disappeared today.A dog was hovering in the sky, spinning around in a daze!An old man fell from the sky and landed on the ground with a bang. He rubbed his waist and cried out in pain. F * ck, it hurts!It can't be like this, right?'He's too ruthless. Other than having a stronger physical body, he doesn't seem to have anything else. This disciple of mine is too ruthless!'There was a loud boom!Li Hao landed on the ground. He grinned and bared his teeth as he looked at the middle-aged man and woman in the distance. Then, he waved at a young man further away and shouted,""Little Yuan, I'm here!"After shouting, he raised his head and looked at the dumbfounded middle-aged man and woman. He grinned foolishly, and it was so brilliant."Mom, dad, I'm here!"The middle-aged man and woman looked at their son in disbelief as he fell from the sky.How did it fall from the sky?He didn't fall to his death!Woof! Woof! Woof!A Black Dog was clinging to Li Hao's leg, as if it was afraid that Li Hao would abandon it.Not far away, a Woman in Black, whose black clothes had turned red, looked at the middle-aged man and woman, and then at Li Hao. While Li Hao was still ecstatic, she suddenly said,""Dad, mom ... I'm Li Hao's fiancée ..."Li Hao was stunned as he looked into the distance."I'll go home first. Wait for me. You can't run away!" The woman turned around and left.Li Hao was extremely dumbfounded!"Lin Hongyu, it's already the daoless era, I'm nothing!" He said.Li Hao roared,"you're ten years older than me!" I've never thought of getting married to you ... This is a new era, a new era!"No one cared.Lin Hongyu, dressed in red, left.I will come and find you!Even though ... The times had changed.
