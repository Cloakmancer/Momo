Gradually, the five small worlds seemed to merge with time."Lock!" Li Hao shouted in a low voice.The five-element Dao domain appeared!Five locks of time!Although time was strong, it was not strong at the moment. It was still under his control. He would lock it down, suppress it, lock the five elements Dao, and stop all changes in time!At the same time, he slapped Yuan Shuo's body with one hand!On his physical body, five special powers emerged. The power of five birds emerged instantly and merged with the Time and Stars!……At the same time.Within the time star.Yuan Shuo's eyes flickered as he frowned slightly. He had some enlightenment, but there was still a problem ... The myriad DAOs were constantly changing, and he couldn't keep up with such changes. Perhaps he needed to stop the changes for a while. It would be best if he could give himself a coordinate so that he could lock onto the outside and have a comparison.At this moment ... His wish came true!All of a sudden, the 10000 DAOs that were supposed to change according to time suddenly transformed into five massive great DAOs. They connected directly to the five elemental DAOs and locked onto the entire time Dao net!At the same time, a strong power of the five elements overflowed from it. It was extremely familiar-it was his own power of the five elements!"What?"Yuan Shuo was stunned for a moment, but in the next moment, he was overjoyed.Did that B * stard notice something unusual?艹!You've finally noticed.It was a good thing!In an instant, he had locked onto the position of the five elemental DAOs. His eyes twitched in joy. The five elemental DAOs could indeed act as a changing coordinate. He quickly checked the DAOs around him.Taking advantage of the fact that the entire time star was locked on, he quickly discovered many things.The next moment, he locked onto ratty and said.He instantly flew towards the rat path!The entire time star trembled madly as if it would collapse at any moment. The time star, which had stopped changing, was now somewhat unstable.As for Yuan Shuo, he did not dare to delay and quickly found the path he was looking for.Soon, he hugged the great Dao and his aura exploded, stirring the great Dao!……In the outside world.The chaotic aura left behind by the rat monster fluctuated. Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he was overjoyed. Without saying anything, he extracted the Dao of chaos in the entire small world.A siphoning power came from the Tao of chaos. In an instant, a figure was drawn out of the time star.With a bang, the shadow fell into the river and crashed heavily. ​ Yuan Shuo's aura appeared and he was in an extremely sorry state.Without waiting for Yuan Shuo to speak, Li Hao extended his hand and stabilized his aura. Then, he stuffed the aura into Yuan Shuo's body. The moment it entered his body ... His body suddenly began to age.In the blink of an eye, his lifespan seemed to have decreased by a lot!Li Hao frowned slightly. The Nirvana realm appeared and enveloped him.From the long river of the great path, he absorbed a lot of power of the great path. Gradually, a small grass was born in the world of Nirvana. The small grass grew wildly, and after a while, it fell into Yuan Shuo's body.His body that had just aged regained its youth in the blink of an eye.At this moment, Li Hao let out a sigh of relief. He withdrew the Nirvana realm and the five elements realm. The time star began to fluctuate again, and the previous quakes disappeared.Yuan Shuo opened his eyes instantly!"That's good!" He smiled."Not bad, kid. To think that you can instantly recover my energy ...""Teacher is too weak!""Restoring a Heavenly King is too easy for me," Li Hao said bluntly.艹!"Damn it!" Yuan Shuo cursed inwardly and said,"do you know that this ...""The myriad DAOs are changing!"Li Hao interrupted his teacher, frowning.""It's more difficult than I expected. The 10000 DAOs are actually changing. If I rashly dismantle the star, it might completely collapse, and I won't be able to recover. "“……”Yuan Shuo was speechless. After a while, he said, "I've already discovered some patterns of change ...""There's a pattern. Six minutes ... It changes every 360 seconds. Every time, it changes to a different Dao to control time! So, time isn't just one type, but ten thousand types of time ..."“……”Yuan Shuo looked at him silently for a long time before he sneered,""What a smart child!"艹!You've already said what I wanted to say, so what else can I say?Li Hao glanced at his teacher and said after a long while,""I have to thank teacher for testing the technique with my own body. Otherwise, I would have missed it. Thank you for your practical guidance!"Yuan Shuo was speechless!How ... Unlucky!Li Hao suddenly laughed again."Alright, I admit it. It was only after you disappeared for a few days that I noticed something. But I don't know the details. Teacher, tell me ..."Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes and said angrily,""Aren't you done? What else did he say?""Teacher, did you notice anything else?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Yuan Shuo glared at him and said after a while,""There are! The other great DAOs were all changing, but they could lock onto some great DAOs. Even if they changed, they could still find their corresponding positions. For example, in the five elements, there were 2000 DAOs in one interval ... As long as you found one, you would definitely be able to find the other four! For example, yin and yang must be opposing forces. For example, Nirvana and recovery were the same! "Thus, according to the positions of these DAOs, as long as you find one, you'll be able to find the corresponding one. Then, through some comparison methods, you'll be able to determine the trend of the changes in the entire 10000 DAOs ... You'll have to go through many cycles, and you might discover some specific patterns. Once every 40 days, I don't have the time to go through them, but you can try."Li Hao kept nodding. He understood.

Chapter 3151 Ever-Changing (1)_ 7
The Dao of the two extremes was very useful here."Also, the convergence of thousands of DAOs has given birth to the time waterdrop. If you can think of a way to extract it and use it as a killing technique, I think it'll be much easier and easier than it is now ..." Yuan Shuo added.Li Hao frowned slightly. It was quite difficult."Let's not talk about this. Teacher, did you gain anything?""Of course!"Yuan Shuo chuckled."The formation of the five-element Dao domain can be referenced from the methods of Time and Stars. A fixed Dao is too easy to break through. I want to ... Make an attempt. A change! "It's ever-changing. What you see is only what you see. In reality, it's constantly changing. I want to create a five-element Dao domain that's ever-changing, so that people can't understand it ..."Li Hao smiled and nodded,"teacher, you can try it yourself." I'm going to fuse with the void realm now!"He did not say anything more. Using the rat Dao that Yuan Shuo had drawn out, he instantly connected his great Dao with the void realm. A small realm began to spin continuously.Gradually, the little realm began to grow.At the same time, this little realm started to fall back to its original world.It was like a shadow that covered the entire world.Gradually ... The Mirage and the little realm fused together.Using the realm to nurture the realm!At this moment, Li Hao extended his hand and beckoned. Director Zhao appeared. Li Hao didn't say much and brought him to the center of the little world. With a wave of his hand, a Dao of chaos seemed to appear.Before director Zhao could see it clearly, Li Hao appeared in the time star again and said,""Go, follow this chaos Dao and walk all the way back ... Not forward, but backward!"The long river of Dao appeared and surged without stopping!Director Zhao fell into a daze. Suddenly, he fell into the river. At this moment, it was as if he had turned into a rat monster. In an instant, he fell into another river, causing waves to sweep over.He fell into one of the waves and seemed to recall something ... And the memory was that of the rat monster that was killed!At that moment, director Zhao was in a daze. It was as if he had become that rat.His heart trembled! This was the river of memories?This ... Was a divine tool of enlightenment!To be able to comprehend the DAOs of different cultivators and place himself within it ... This was unbelievable!Li Hao's voice resounded in his mind.""The speed has to be fast ... After all, it involves time. The more turbulent the waves are, the more unforgettable it is! Don't comprehend too much, or you'll be assimilated into the next big rat ... You can just look at other people's Dao, you don't have to comprehend it deeply ...""Also, there's a price to pay for looking at these things. The main thing is the consumption of lifespan ... Also, don't look into the future for no reason. The future you see might not be real, and it will affect you!" Director Zhao remembered it in his heart and didn't say much.He continued to immerse himself in those extremely realistic memories.This was the history of a rat's struggle. Every venerable sovereign had their own history of struggle. Even if it was not worth mentioning in the eyes of powerful existences, to director Zhao, personally watching a rat become a venerable sovereign, becoming the Lord of a world ... Over the long years, even if it was just a few flashes of memory, it was enough for him to reap great benefits!After who knows how long, director Zhao suddenly fell from the river.His eyes were a little dazed, but in the next moment, they were filled with cunning and fierceness.After a while, he gradually calmed down. He looked at Li Hao and suddenly said,""It's best not to spread this technique ... There's a fatal problem. Once you fuse with it, it's easy to get lost or even ... Be replaced!"He was still a little scared."I'm fine. The Beast of Chaos 'memory is not complicated, and it didn't experience many things. It didn't experience as much as I did in Silver Moon, so I quickly discarded some things. Otherwise, I could easily become the second rat monster!"Li Hao nodded."This is called the river of memories. It's not as simple as watching TV. You have to immerse yourself in it and comprehend it ... Of course, ordinary people don't try it, and they can 't!""Director Zhao, do you think it's possible to impersonate him?""Yes, I can!""Yes." Director Zhao nodded and was a little shocked."Unless the other party personally investigates me ... It'll be very difficult for others to find out if I impersonate him. Be it conversation, communication, or aura, I can imitate everything! It's even difficult to distinguish between the true and the false when you're in that realm ... However, once an expert forcefully investigates my nature, I'll be exposed. ""I don't think so!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao shook his head."That's a provocation to the venerable sovereigns. It's a declaration of war. Here, the Dragon Lord still has a deterrent force. That's good!""This way, my plan of raising a realm with a realm can be officially implemented!"At this moment, he revealed a smile.He then looked at the river of time. At this moment, it was also connected to the first Ethereal Plane.However ... The slightly troublesome thing was that the time star might have to temporarily separate from him to stabilize this illusory River. In this way, he might not be able to use the power of time in time.Of course, this wasn't a big problem. He could temporarily break away from time and let himself travel the world without time. Perhaps this was also a test for himself.Looking at his teacher, who was standing not too far away from him, it seemed as though he had gained some new insights.He wondered if he could construct a complete Dao domain this time.If a complete Dao domain was constructed, did that mean that the path to rank seven had been opened?Of course, it was not that simple. At the very least, Li Hao did not have enough resources to support a level 7.Step by step!At this moment, his illusory little world was also absorbing the energy of this little world to perfect itself. Li Hao chuckled. He had gained the power of another little world.

Chapter 3152 Cooperation (1)
Li Hao's false world merged with the real world.The first step was completed perfectly.A Turtledove occupying The Magpie's Nest, a li replacing the peach.In the world, the two half-emperors were still rapidly gathering the human race. These humans would soon provide them with unlimited power of belief. There were many living beings in a small world.However, the Dragon field and the other worlds had fewer people because of the mass slaughter.For example, Silver Moon was previously an unranked world, and the star dynasty had a population of ten billion. After the World expanded, over the past 500 years, the population had doubled and was still increasing.Most mid-tier worlds could accommodate a population of a hundred billion.This small world was actually even bigger than Silver Moon 's, but there weren't even five billion humans. In this huge world, there were probably only three to four billion humans.It was much less than expected.Of course, Li Hao didn't find anything wrong with it. The chaos beasts did this, and there were so many people. It had to be said that the strongest aspect of the human race was their ability to reproduce and survive.Among the intelligent species, they were not the strongest. Those with the best talent were the ones who could survive the most. Although some species were more fertile, their intelligence was too low.……In the world. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao landed.At this moment, director Zhao's aura shook and a weak chaotic aura spread out. In the next moment, an image appeared behind him. A giant rat took form and was extremely vicious."This is called a sky pilfering rat!""Illusionary heavenly rat world!" The rat's voice rang out,"this world is also known as the illusionary heavenly rat world!""The illusionary heavenly rat world belongs to a subsidiary world of the treasure-connecting world ..."Li Hao was stunned. What did he mean?Rat ... No, old Zhao explained,""In the Dragon field, it's not only the Dragon Master who is dominant. In the Dragon field, there's actually the chaos alliance! The Lords of great cosmoses are all considered members of the Alliance. They are rank seven and rank eight venerable sovereigns who have formed the chaos alliance!""The treasure-connected world is a rank seven world, and the master of the rank seven world is venerable sovereign treasure-connected. The other party is also a rat, but they are not of the same type. They are treasure-connected rats. Therefore, the sky pilfering rats of the fantasy Sky World are directly above the treasure-connected world ... However, the treasure-connected world is a member of the Dragon Realm Alliance, so it is also considered a subsidiary of the dragon world."Because he had entered the other party's sea of memory, he had learned quite a bit.They didn't know much about the Dragon field before, but Li Hao's interest was piqued.""Chaos alliance?""That's right. Apart from the chaos alliance, there are actually two other small alliances in the Dragon field. One of them is the iron-eating Alliance formed by the local demon race to fight against the chaos beasts. It's led by a few Level Seven venerable sovereigns. The other is the defense Alliance formed by the human race. The Dragon field also has human-dominated worlds, but their strength is average. There are as many as 17 Level 7 worlds in the Dragon field!" "In the chaos alliance, apart from the rank 8 Dragon World, there are 11 rank 7 worlds, forming 12 major world alliances.""The iron-eating Alliance formed by the iron-eating world, including the iron-eating world, only has five rank-7 great worlds.""As for the human race ..."Li Hao was speechless. Was there a need to count?"The human race only has one Tier-7 great world?" he asked, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.17, including Dragon World, which was at the eighth rank, that was 18.Only one human family?Was this considered an Alliance?"Ahem!"Director Zhao coughed."Not only that, because...There's actually another large world, only that their sector Lord is only at the 6th level, similar to sector Lord Senlan. However, they are said to be one with the Dao Lord and sector Lord, almost at the 7th level. They just don't dare to rashly enter the 7th level and have been hiding, afraid of making too much noise and attracting chaos beasts. And chaos beasts love to take other people's 7th level large worlds!"Alright, two.However ... There might only be one tier 7 expert. Even if that family had more than one, at most two or three, there were only many tier 7 neo martial experts in the tier 7 world. Other worlds usually had one or two."This human world hasn't been destroyed?"Li Hao found it strange. There were so many Beasts of Chaos and local demons, but you still existed. It's not easy!p Director Zhao explained,"it's very difficult to survive here, but the other world is said to be close to the easternmost land. There's a dangerous place called the lightning zone!" The other party's world Lord is a Thunder attribute expert, and half of the world is practically in Thunder. The Dragon Master has also been there once, but it is said that he didn't gain much advantage. Once too many experts went, the other party fled into the Thunder region ... So it has still been preserved until now. ""You do have some ability!"Li Hao nodded. He was quite capable.If he didn't have some ability, there were 18 great worlds in this place, and the human race was the only one. It had long been devoured, but the other party still existed. The Lord of the human race in this world was not ordinary.He was also very bold to actually not leave.Of course, it was possible that they couldn't escape and didn't dare to leave the vicinity of the lightning territory. As for passing through the lightning territory, it was also possible that they couldn't pass through and could only hide for a while.Only by occupying dangerous places could they barely hold on."What is that world called?"Director Zhao shook his head."I don't know. The sky pilfering rat only mentioned it briefly in its memory. It's only a first stage venerable sovereign and isn't a Big Shot here. It doesn't have the right to care about the Alliance's matters. It's just some hearsay. I do know that the human powerhouse is called the Lord of Thunder, and that world is probably the Thunder World or something."

Chapter 3153 Cooperation (Part 2)
Li Hao nodded slightly.It was quite surprising that there was a rank 7 world dominated by humans here.Perhaps, the experts of the other three regions might not even know of this person.Otherwise, the Senlan sector Lord would have at least said a few words.From the looks of it, the other party wasn't too happy. He was always trapped and probably didn't dare to leave the world. Once he left, the world would be gone."Is the conflict between the local demon race and the chaos beasts big?""It's alright, it's not too serious. After all, they're all demons. There are differences between the local demons and Beasts of Chaos ... But the conflict isn't too big. The Dragon Lord is actually a powerful expert. The other party's original intention was to subdue the local demons ... However, the iron-eating world didn't seem to be happy, so they joined forces with the other four major demon worlds. There are quite a few Level Seven venerable sovereigns. The Dragon Lord didn't want to attack rashly as he was afraid of losing too much ..."Therefore, it was a rare period of peace between the two sides. However, the area occupied by the local demon race was very small. Almost all the worlds were gathered together. Only the worlds where the Beasts of Chaos lived in the Dragon field dared to spread out unscrupulously.There were also benefits to splitting them up, as there was sufficient chaotic energy.When they gathered together, the chaotic energy in a place was limited. It was very difficult for the world to grow. It was also very difficult for the strong to cultivate. If this continued, the local demons might self-destruct in another tens of thousands of years.To an expert, it was worth it to spend tens of thousands of years to let the other party dissipate naturally without moving a single soldier.At this moment, Li Hao had a general understanding of the Dragon field. Of course, it was only a general understanding.As for the specifics, how many Level 7s there were in a world, how many Level 7s there were among the chaos beasts, and how many Level 7s there were that did not manage to capture a world ... These were all unknown."By the way, what's the so-called patrol of the dragon world about? do you know the details?"Director Zhao shook his head again."I'm not too sure. I only know that it's an inspection organization formed by the chaos alliance. All the great worlds have sent a portion of their venerable sovereigns in. There are even rank seven venerable sovereigns in charge! It's mainly to patrol the Dragon field and find some newly born kapok trees. Once new kapok trees appear, they'll arrange for chaos beasts to seize them and destroy the rise of the human race from the root!"He only knew this much, and said,""One more thing. We will inspect some worlds regularly to prevent human beings and local demons from rebelling! Under normal circumstances, there should be at least two venerable sovereigns traveling together, and ... It's highly likely that they won't be moving together, but one in the light and one in the dark, just in case!"Li Hao frowned and nodded.The Dragon Lord ... He had met him once before. At that time, he felt that he was just so-so, so he was a little hesitant. He didn't dare to participate in the battle all this while, and he seemed a little incompetent.In the end ... From the Chaos Beast's side this time, this Dragon Lord was definitely not that kind of foolish and incompetent person.There were also very few eighth level venerable sovereigns who were incompetent.However, it was much harder to deal with than he had expected. At this moment, Li Hao hoped that the Dragon Lord would take the world to the Scarlet sun region to participate in the war. If the Dragon Lord didn't leave, it would be very difficult for him to stir up any trouble in the Dragon field.His control over the Dragon field was far greater than that of the other three overlords.At this time, Kong Ji spoke,"then should we go find the lightning Master or the iron-eating realm Lord ...""I'm not going!"Li Hao shook his head.Kong Ji was startled. Why?Before this, they had worked together with the Senlan sector Lord and it was a happy cooperation. When they were attacking the four worlds, they had also worked together with the neo martial Swordmaster and the others to successfully take down the four worlds.Now that the other party was incomparably powerful, how could they not find someone to cooperate with?Li Hao, however, shook his head and said, the local demons are still demons. As for that Thunder region master ... Forget it, he's living a life that's even tougher than us. He's a big target and can't wait to hide near the Thunder region. He wouldn't dare to make a move. If we go, we might be targeted!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "No hurry!"Li Hao smiled."Let's complete my plan first. We'll seize the small realm and replace it with it as the main force!" If I can take this opportunity to reach the sixth step, that would be the best. If I do, with the power of a thousand worlds, we can work together and kill an ordinary seventh step cultivator!"However, after some thought, Li Hao frowned.""The Dragon field is like an impenetrable net. It's fine if it's only one or two worlds, but if there are dozens ... Or hundreds, we'll definitely be discovered! Therefore, there's one more thing. It's best to let the Dragon field's attention not be on the mainland ... It's best if the Dragon Master can take the Dragon field, or even summon a group of powerhouses, to the Scarlet sun region to encircle and annihilate the new martial artists!"Kong Ji suddenly bared his teeth. Besieging neo martial ... You're really not afraid of neo martial dying. "But that's not something we can control!"Kong Ji frowned slightly."Unless ... My father announces that he will support new martial and participate in the war. New martial will join forces with light. This will pose the greatest threat to the others. Even if the Dragon Master is unwilling, he will definitely participate in the war. Otherwise ... Once the two sides join forces, chiyang will definitely be defeated!"Speaking of this, he shook his head slightly. That was his father's business, and it concerned the bright future of the entire world. He would not interfere or care. Even if he had the right to speak, he would not make the decision on his father's behalf.At this stage, choosing to support new martial would be making an enemy out of everyone in the four-square region.There was a high probability that his father would not make a rash decision at this moment.Li Hao thought for a while and shook his head. It was very difficult for him to interfere with the choice of a level 8 world. Let alone a level 8 world, even a level 7 world was difficult ... There was Senlan, but she was not very useful. No one would take a level 7 world seriously.

Chapter 3154 Cooperation (3)
"Let's leave first. We'll perfect the plan. If we're really exposed ..."Li Hao exhaled,"then change!" "There's no fixed plan. If this path doesn't work, we'll change it ... In short, this time, the Dragon field will definitely be the last wave of great opportunities for us to strengthen ourselves. At least for the square field, the new martial arts world is struggling in the chiyang field, the Redmoon field is half-crippled, and the tianfang field won't be our turn. Only the Dragon field is left. It won't be a burden to kill all these chaos beasts ..."This was the best choice and the best choice.Kong Ji also nodded. He wanted to vindicate rank seven here.At this moment, Li Hao looked around at the entire world. The ethereal Plane was rooted here, but there was something wrong with it. Many of the demon beasts and Beasts of Chaos in this place had been killed, and the remaining ones had been driven away. It was not like before, when demons were wandering everywhere.It was hard to investigate in the outer realm, but once someone entered the inner realm...They would be exposed. In a world dominated by chaos beasts, how could they allow humans to move around? those humans all had faith.In short, he couldn't let anyone enter the realm, otherwise, it would be too easy to be seen through!Li Hao suddenly frowned.He felt a sense of danger.At the side, Kong Ji was also a little uncomfortable.After glancing at Li Hao, Li Hao was stunned at first. Then, his expression changed slightly. The next moment, he sent a message to everyone."Quick, all Silvermoon people, return quickly!"Soon, the Silver Moon cultivators returned from all directions.They were all a little confused. What was going on?Li Hao's expression changed. When they arrived, he quickly let them enter the Silvermoon world. The Black Panther also quickly transformed into a giant beast. Li Hao didn't care what the black Panther thought and instantly put it into the river.The next moment, the underhand technique appeared and a small domain enveloped him.However, he still looked solemn.He looked at director Zhao and took in a deep breath,""Not good ... Maybe ... The red moon Lord is nearby!" He thought.Director Zhao's expression changed. Why did he say that?"Kong Ji and I absorbed a lot of the Crimson Moon's power. I even tore apart the other party's Dao, which suddenly made Kong Ji and I feel some danger ... It's highly likely that he's wandering nearby. He might be here to find the Dragon Lord, or he might be leaving ..."Li Hao said quickly. He looked at the world Channel and felt a headache.A powerhouse of the eighth step! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This is troublesome!The other party wouldn't be passing by, right?He quickly looked at director Zhao."Go to the realm gate immediately. Don't reveal anything ... If the other party really comes, even if they want to investigate you, you have to pretend that you don't know anything. If the other party takes the initiative to speak ... You ... You can use the Dragon Lord to scare the other party!"Li Hao believed that director Zhao would respond.However, if a rank eight Lord tried to forcefully investigate, he wouldn't be able to hide anything.What a headache!Why was the other party in the vicinity at this time? Thinking of this ... He hesitated for a moment and suddenly called out to the two,""Queen, King of li ... Don't hide ... I'm worried that they can sense the existence of faith. If they had passed by earlier, they might have noticed some changes ... You two ... You two and director Zhao, make some injuries on your bodies and pretend that you've just finished the battle ..."He didn't know if it was useful, and his expression kept changing.Level eight venerable sovereign!It was too late to escape now.If he was just passing by, it would be best. If he sensed something and insisted on staying or even entering the realm ... This time, he would be in big trouble. The chaos was so big. How could there be such a coincidence?The other party was nearby!If he and Kong Ji hadn't absorbed a lot of the power of the Crimson Moon, they wouldn't have felt it at all.However, it was also because he had absorbed a lot of the red moon's power that he had to be careful of being detected by Red Moon master.He looked at Kong Ji and took a deep breath,""Nirvana, you and I are hiding near the source of the world. If the other party really finds you and me ... We'll go all out. Whoever can run is one. Only when one person is entangled for a moment can the other person gain a little chance ..."Kong Ji nodded and didn't say anything.Would the red moon Lord come here?He did not know.​ However, if they did come ... Their chances of escaping would be almost zero. The difference between an eighth-rank and a sixth-rank was too great. Even if they could fight a seventh-rank, they would not be a match for the other party at this moment.……In the chaos.The red moon master wandered around leisurely. Although the Dragon Master had not officially agreed, the other party had clearly begun to consider the possibility of agreeing.However, he couldn't stay in the dragon world for long.The Dragon Lord had always been on guard against him, wishing that he could get lost immediately.He wasn't an annoying person. After chatting for a while, he started to rush towards the tianfang region. Without the great Dao universe, he could only use this method to travel, which made him very annoyed.How could a true Overlord be in such a hurry?It was called the expansion, coverage, and instant arrival of the universe ... Those who used this method to travel were all weak rogue cultivators.At this moment, he looked forward ... And that little realm was somewhat familiar.When he passed by a few days ago, he had sensed some power of faith and mentioned it in the dragon world. However, the dragon world didn't care. It was just two half-step sovereigns causing trouble. Who would care?Red Moon master didn't care. She was just watching the show.They were close to the tianfang region.He continued to move forward. He was not in the mood to greet a weakling. It was not worth it. Moreover, it was a beast of primordial chaos. It was only a first stage venerable sovereign.

Chapter 3155 Cooperation (Part 4)
At the same time, he swept his divine sense across the world.This look ... Made him slightly stunned.So fast!The faith spread so quickly. The last time he had come, it had only been in a small area. But today, it seemed that more than half of the world had fallen. And near the realm gate, the giant rat sitting cross-legged seemed to be injured."He actually couldn't fight two half-step sovereigns?"Red Moon master was surprised. A venerable sovereign, the master of a world, couldn't defeat two half-step sovereigns and even lost more than half of his control. What was going on?This was interesting!If the two half-step sovereigns were killed and their faith was destroyed, he wouldn't even bother to look at them.However, at this moment, there seemed to be some changes in this world.How interesting!Of course, while he found it interesting, he also frowned slightly. This world ... Gave him a sense of familiarity. That ... Extremely weak power of desire seemed to be very similar to the power of the Crimson Moon.His speed was very fast, and gradually, he was getting closer and closer to this world.And the big rat at the realm gate had never noticed it.It was only when Red Moon Lord was about to get close to it that the big rat seemed to be a little slow to react and looked into the distance. It was shocked, and the next moment, a spiritual wave burst out."Two-legged beast...No, human? A human venerable sovereign? How dare you ... A human venerable sovereign ..."In an instant, the large rat seemed to want to cry out. A Primal Chaos great Dao erupted with resentment and even anger. "You're the reinforcement that those two guys invited? You're their backer?""Squeak"A sharp screech reverberated in all directions. The large rat was extremely angry and roared,""I finally know why they are so arrogant. It turns out that they have a middle-stage venerable sovereign behind them ... Very good!""Dragon Lord, you dare to provoke ..."As soon as it finished speaking, the large rat suddenly fled into the air. It was extremely angry."Just you wait, so what if I give you this world ... Let's see how long you can be arrogant for!"The other party's sudden reaction stunned Red Moon master.He was just passing by and happened to sense some familiar auras, so he went closer to take a look ... In the end, he didn't say anything, and this little mouse suddenly went crazy!Hearing this ... It seemed that he had suffered a loss at the hands of those two half-step sovereigns. From the looks of it, he had mistakenly thought that he was the person behind those two half-step sovereigns.Red Moon master sneered.He wasn't afraid of anything. It was just that ... The Beasts of Chaos in the Dragon field were relatively United. Provoking one was equivalent to provoking all of them. The Dragon Master wasn't a big-hearted person.He didn't want to cause any misunderstandings over something that had nothing to do with him.He was all alone now. Once he was besieged by the experts of the Dragon field, he might suffer a great loss."Little rat!"  please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, he instantly appeared before director Zhao. Director Zhao's heart was about to jump out of his chest. It was only thanks to his many years of forbearance in Silver Moon that he was not scared to death. Even now, he was still trembling."Who are you? If you dare to kill me ... I'm the Dragon Lord's subordinate ..."With that, the aura of chaos overflowed from his body, and he made threatening gestures, bluffing,""I'll give the world to you. I don't want it anymore ... The Dragon Master might not care if you take over a world. If you dare to kill me and a Chaos Emperor, the Alliance will never let you off!"The next moment, before Red Moon master could speak, he shrieked,""You're from the Thunder region's Thunderbolt sector Lord? You can't kill me. If you kill me, the Alliance will pay the price and attack the lightning territory ...""Shut up!" Red Moon master frowned.A powerful pressure instantly suppressed the other party. Director Zhao was also scared out of his wits. At this moment, he was just an empty shell. He couldn't do anything. If he did, he would be exposed.The other party couldn't probe too deeply either. The moment they broke through the thin layer of primal energy on his outer façade ... His Foundation would be exposed.It could be said that he was a paper tiger at this moment.Not to mention that the other party was at the eighth-rank, even if he was at the fourth-rank, as long as he dared to move or hit him, he would be exposed!Red Moon master was not interested in talking too much with this small fry. She frowned and said,""I am Hong Yue! Why are you running when you're just passing by?""Red Moon sovereign ..." Director Zhao was shocked.He seemed to be very shocked. The next moment, his eyes were full of fear, as if he was saying,"the Crimson Moon has invaded the Dragon field ..."Red Moon sovereign could tell.He was extremely speechless! It's not your place to find out that I've invaded the Dragon field.If it wasn't for the fact that it was a beast of primordial chaos, he would have just killed it with a slap. Of course, this was the Dragon field ...He suppressed the unhappiness in his heart and said indifferently,""This King has no interest in your matters. The two half-emperors in your realm have nothing to do with this King. This King is not interested in your rank One World!"Director Zhao nodded his head crazily, his eyes shifty ... At this moment, he had already turned into a rat and was even more wretched."I know, I know. I've misunderstood. Does my Lord need some blood food?"“……”Red Moon sovereign's eyes were full of killing intent. Although he didn't care about these humans, he was a human. How could they offer him blood and food?Director Zhao seemed to be frightened. His body trembled and he said hurriedly,""No, no... I'm saying ..."After saying that, he was so scared that his body felt uncomfortable. Suddenly, a stench appeared.A heavenly technique!Red Moon was speechless.At the venerable sovereign level, someone ... Someone ... Farted?Red Moon sovereign was shocked!艹!

Chapter 3156 Cooperation (Part 5)
It was so stinky. It was still stinky.This ... He was so scared that he wet his pants?Was there a need to?A venerable sovereign!He was ... Utterly disgusted.As an eighth level venerable sovereign, he had passed this stage countless years ago. At this moment, a venerable sovereign was so frightened that he peed his pants in front of him.For a moment, he was afraid that this timid little mouse would be scared to death.All of a sudden, he lost all interest, only disgust and disdain. He said indifferently,""No need, you can keep it!"Then, he disappeared into thin air.Director Zhao was still farting ... The stench was getting worse and worse. Even the chaos beasts nearby seemed to be affected by it. The red moon sovereign shook her head slightly. Even a venerable sovereign could be scared to the point of peeing. It seemed that whether it was a Beast of Chaos or a human ... They were all the same.These beasts of primordial chaos were also the type to bully the weak and fear the strong.He didn't feel like dwelling on this matter.As for the faint power of desire that he had sensed earlier, he had thrown it aside. Perhaps it was a cultivator who also had the Dao of desire in this world, or perhaps it was the little mouse's strong desire, or perhaps ...In short, after director Zhao farts, this person was not willing to stay.Boring!With a single step, he teleported at an extremely fast speed. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared and crossed the chaos, heading straight for the tianfang region.As for director Zhao, he carefully returned to the realm gate.He didn't dare to move and just waited like that. He seemed to be a little scared and would even fart from time to time ...This old politician knew very well what these high and mighty people really cared about.Threats, intimidation ... please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The other party might not care about these things. However, defiling them ... They would care. A fart would definitely make this level 8 leave. Of course, if one came for no reason, the other party would really slap you to death.The other party was frightened by him and lost control. There was no other way. The other party could only avoid him to avoid being tainted.……Director Zhao was scared.A moment later, Li Hao appeared. Director Zhao was stunned."Why did you come out ..."Li Hao smiled."An expert like that wouldn't be interested in following us in the dark. If he had sensed something unusual and guessed that we might be here, he would have come here a long time ago. Why would he hide in the dark?"That would be underestimating Red Moon master.If they had really guessed that Li Hao was here, why would they be guarding him in secret?So what if he killed a first-stage Chaos Beast? if he could kill Li Hao and the Dragon Lord was here, the other party would not be polite.So, if he didn't appear, he really left. "How scary!" Li Hao also exhaled.Then, he suddenly laughed."He should have come from the dragon world. It seems that these guys are indeed contacting the Dragon Lord. I'm just not sure if the Dragon Lord has agreed.""And ... He actually managed to hide it from the eighth-grade!"He suddenly laughed."As long as I don't make a move, it seems that going deep into the river of memories, extracting memories, and simulating the great Dao ... Will really work!"Being pretentious was also a kind of ability!Li Hao's eyes flickered. Even if the other party did not care about a level one venerable sovereign, the fact that a level eight venerable sovereign, who was born with an eye of wisdom, did not see through him was the greatest success.Li Hao's smile was brilliant!Now, I was much more confident. The red moon Lord was an excellent Laboratory Technician. Since he had tested it, it meant that the method was very useful. It also meant that the power of time was really strong.It was just an additional technique."It's really stinky. Director Zhao, don't let it go next time. "Director Zhao was speechless.F * ck, wasn't it all for you?Don't I know it's stinky?At this moment, Kong Ji was also a little scared.""We almost fell. Compared to a tier 8, we're far inferior. If it weren't for the fact that we sensed it in advance ... We would really be finished."After saying that, he frowned."We've absorbed a large amount of the Crimson Moon's power, and we haven't been able to get rid of it until now. Although we can sense the other party in advance ... They don't have a great Dao universe, so they can't sense us much, but they should still be able to sense us a little. This time, I can only say that they didn't care ... Haoyue, do you have a way to get rid of it completely?"The two of them had already gone through a life and death situation, but the result was not completely eliminated!If it wasn't for director Zhao's fart making him unhappy and forcing him to leave early, he would be finished.Li Hao smiled."It's okay. I'll ask Qian Wuliang to help us wash it off. It will be gone gradually.""Can he do it?""It's not a big problem,""If it really doesn't work, I'll just go through the lightning tribulation a few times and get rid of it completely!"Li Hao didn't say much. He glanced in the direction where Red Moon master had left. This level 8 had worked so hard and even came to persuade him personally. She was quite thoughtful.However, he didn't have the great Dao universe ... Even if he killed the human King, would he give him the great Dao universe of neo martial?Why did he have to work so hard?The more Red Moon master worked hard ... The more he schemed. Cloud Master had to be careful when working with him. Of course, Cloud Master was not a good person either. It might be a good thing for him to be killed by Red Moon master.Li Hao stopped thinking about this. It wasn't good to stay here for long. He quickly said, "Let's go and take a look at the fire Phoenix World! It's said that outsiders can enter that place ... Black Panther, let's go there and find out the strength of this rank 7 world. If it's suitable ... Perhaps this will be the first rank 7 world we'll be targeting!"If he and Kong Ji worked together, they could still touch the Tiger's butt at Level Seven, but it was impossible to touch it at level eight.Along the way, they might be able to take down a few more worlds.First, he had to construct the embryonic form of the river of time. This way, even if he was far away, he could still contact him. He could even be teleported over. Although he hadn't fused his Dao of space into it yet, it should gather quickly.

Chapter 3157 Cooperation (Part 6)
If there was no danger along the way, the two masters of the great Dao could also use the great Dao universe to hurry on their way.……While Li Hao's group was heading to the fire Phoenix Sector ...Chiyang region.The human King frowned slightly as he looked at the Crimson sun World in the distance.The Supreme, who had never left the neo martial world, was also here at this moment. He did not bring Emperor Cang with him, but the two of them came alone to investigate the situation.At this moment, the Grandmaster said softly,"I missed the opportunity!" I don't know where this guy recruited some powerhouses from ... It's possible ... That there are other level 8 existences!"As he said this, he glanced at the human King."You insisted on stalling for time and waiting for li Changsheng to return. Otherwise ... We could have attacked earlier and perhaps we could have taken him down by force. Now, a new powerhouse has suddenly arrived. It might be a powerhouse from outside the Thunder territory.""You're blaming me?"The human King rolled his eyes,"I said wait, didn't you agree?" You're really good at shirking responsibility. Do you believe that I'll go public and say that you're irresponsible?"The Grandmaster was speechless.This guy was so boring."It seems that venerable red sun is very nervous ..." He suddenly laughed."However, it may not be a good thing to attract experts from outside the square region. It seems that the temptation of the tianfang universe is too great ..."The human King nodded and suddenly laughed,""Good news!"He had a playful look in his eyes,'a few more powerhouses have come, this is interesting! Otherwise, the four-sided domain will be playing with its own people ... How boring would that be!""We haven't reached the eighth rank yet!""We should first enter the eighth-rank before deciding!" Grandmaster slightly raised his eyebrows.The human King chuckled,"what's the rush?" "Level eight ... It's too difficult for me and the big lazy cat to reach level eight. A level eight world might not be enough. If we add a few more powerhouses, it might be enough. It'll be enough for me and the big cat to reach level eight! It's only interesting that way. Otherwise, I might not be able to balance my yin and yang when I enter the eighth rank alone!"Speaking of this, he chuckled again."It's good to have more powerhouses. With more, my neo martial arts can have a few more grade-7!""You're going to kill them?""If you can kill him, then you can say that!" Grandmaster chuckled.The human King said unhurriedly,"there's no hurry. Has Li Hao left Tian Fang?" Now, is Tian Fang without an owner again?"  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Yes.""Do you still remember the fake heavenly tomb?""What?"The Supreme martial artist raised his eyebrows. Of course, he remembered. At that time, he killed a large number of enemies and trapped a large number of enemies, which gave neo martial enough time to develop.It was also that change that allowed the neo martial artists to rise rapidly from the oppression.And that time ... To put it bluntly, he was the main contributor. He brought a large number of neo martial artists into it to act as bait, while Fang ping led a group of people to invade the world outside ..."How about one more time?"The Grandmaster fell into deep thought as he looked at the human King.The human King chuckled."That little Li Hao even dared to create a fake resurrection and trap a large number of experts, including me ... Old Zhang, let's play once too. We'll lure a group of people over and kill them for a feast!""We might not be strong enough!" The Grandmaster frowned.The human King laughed,"enough, why not?" Don't worry, this time I won't let you be the first to fight. I'll act with big cat ... And you don't need to go. You only have one goal ... Bring people and take down the cloud world!""Yunxiao?" "Right!"The human King laughed,"everyone says that I want to beat Chi Yang ... If I don't beat Chi Yang, I can't enter the eighth grade. Why do I have to beat Chi Yang?" Even if they don't enter the eighth rank, our side will have one or two more seventh-rank experts after defeating Yunxiao. That's not bad!""The cloud Lord is an idiot ... Even his own people have rebelled against him. He doesn't look like much, and now he's with Red Moon. Instead of letting Red Moon take advantage of him, we might as well take him down!"He didn't say much about the specific plan, and he didn't have any specific plans.Just one goal was enough.As for how to implement it, it would depend on the plans of the Supreme martial artist. Of course, he might not follow this plan. It was just a saying that he would make a decision at the last minute. For the human King, this was really used to the extreme. He himself did not know what his next step was, so how would the enemy know?After saying this, he suddenly laughed."You say ... There are a few powerful cultivators from the outside world here in Chi Yang. Then, in the world outside the Thunder region ... Does it mean that they have no one to keep watch?""What?"The Grandmaster looked at him again, his head aching. "Don't be so fickle. Don't tell me you're planning to sneak out and attack their lair?""Why can't I?"The human King chuckled."They're quite bold. They actually dared to come all the way here. How about I give them a surprise?"Then, he chuckled."Why don't you bring some people into the Thunder region and sneak attack their nest ... If you can't succeed, then circle around the Thunder region and enter from the tianfang region. Then, you can sneak an attack on Yunxiao ... If you succeed, we can eat big meat ...""And I will gather the attention of all the powerhouses in the four-square domain!"The human King suddenly became ruthless and sneered,""These guys want to fight me! If that's the case, then don't blame me for being impolite!"The Grandmaster quickly calculated for a while, then said,"Then you can only take Cang Mao with you. The rest of you must come with me! Can you two ... Do it?"One was crazy and dared to do anything.She was in a daze and dared to listen to everything."You don't believe me?" the human King chuckled.Yes, I don't believe it.The Grandmaster was speechless. How could he trust you? Alright, she believed him a little."It's not that I don't believe you, I'm just worried that you'll do something reckless ...""Tsk!"The human King laughed,"what are you afraid of? if we don't mess around, will we be able to disrupt the enemy's plan?" What's more interesting is that little Li Hao has gone to the Dragon field. Before, he dared to attack the four major fields. Do you think he'll dare to attack the Dragon field world now that I've attracted the experts of the Dragon field?""Is he strong enough?" the Grandmaster instantly raised his eyebrows."It's not enough, but ... What's wrong with trusting Him a little?"The human King laughed,"if it's really not possible, we'll just use time. At most, we'll just have to pay a price. If we really destroy the time star, it's actually a good thing. It's decided then. Let's see if he's brave enough. If he's brave enough, we'll eat meat together. If he's not ... The little guy can't do it, we'll play by ourselves!"The Grandmaster nodded his head, not paying it much mind. Silvermoon was still too weak.Fang ping was just joining in on the fun and wanted to bring the other party along to play ... The point was, if there was no contact, the other party might not be able to understand this kind of thought.At this moment, he cast his gaze into the distance ... The square outer realm?Perhaps, it was even more interesting!Neo martial would never stay in the four-sided domain forever!

Chapter 3158 Ambition (1)
(The second one was a little later)In the Dragon field.The fire Phoenix World.The fire Phoenix World was considered an important business area in the Dragon field. Even though the chaos beasts of the Dragon field were in charge, the chaos beasts had intelligence and some business wisdom.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Trading, buying, cultivating, and recruiting experts. A large world that could be opened to the outside world would attract countless experts.The other three regions also had similar places. Of course, the most famous one was still the tianfang world.However, tianfang world wasn't the world of chaos beasts.In the Dragon field, it was the inferno Phoenix World that took on this role. There were unaffiliated chaos beasts, naturally born chaos beasts, beasts without inheritances, native demons without worlds, and even some wandering human cultivators ... The prerequisite was that the other party dared to come.The inferno Phoenix World didn't reject humans from entering. As long as one wasn't afraid of dying here or being targeted by others, they were welcome to trade or cultivate here.The reason why it was the fire Phoenix World and not the dragon world was due to the wisdom of the Dragon Lord.The dragon world was the core, and once it was broken through, it would be troublesome.Even though the firephoenix world was very powerful, it wouldn't be too much of an impact if a rank seven world was broken through.Furthermore, the inferno Phoenix World wasn't too far away from the Dragon Realm.It would be difficult to arrive quickly and provide assistance, but if something happened to the fire Phoenix World, the dragon world would be able to receive the news very quickly and react in time. They would be able to react in time whether they should respond, escape, or encircle the enemy.……Outside the inferno Phoenix World.Li Hao observed for a while and sighed.""Don't say, the Dragon Lord is a character! It's located in the center of the Dragon Realm, the giant elephant realm, the Tiger realm, and the treasure realm. "Such a geographical location was very safe.Once this place was breached, the four sides could surround and attack. They could attack or retreat at will. With the fire Phoenix World, there were five major worlds in the vicinity.Clearly, this should be the Dragon Master's or the chaos Alliance's special arrangement.It wasn't natural. All great worlds were in such a position.Opening up the fire Phoenix World...Not only would it allow the chaos beasts to interact, even some of the wandering chaos beasts, even the stronger ones, could be attracted here, allowing the chaos beasts to grow stronger."Yes!" Kong Ji nodded."The other three regions also have the same idea, but they don't dare to let others enter their own worlds. Heaven's convenience has become the biggest Trading Point in the three regions nearby!"However, tianfang's side had been dominated by itinerant cultivators, and it was an ownerless great world. This place had an owner. "More importantly ... The other party even allows humans to enter. Do any humans dare to enter?"Kong Ji laughed.It was a level Seven Chaos Beast World, and the Dragon field was extremely repulsed by humans. Even if there were humans wandering around, they would only walk around in the chaos. Who would dare to enter?As he said that, Li Hao suddenly pointed into the distance. Over there, a human venerable sovereign was rapidly descending toward the inferno Phoenix World."You ..." Kong Ji was startled and surprised."Are you crazy?"There were actually humans who dared to enter?At this moment, there were also beasts of primordial chaos guarding the fire Phoenix realm gate, and they were not weak either. However ... The human seemed to be quite familiar with each other as he landed. There was no discord between the two sides. On the contrary, they seemed to know each other. It was as if they had greeted each other for a while before the human landed in the realm. Kong Ji was a little confused. What was going on?Li Hao thought for a moment and frowned."Humans are the main force of chaos, after all. There are many humans in the Dragon field. Although humans in some worlds are weak, there are native humans in the dragon world ... It seems normal if humans are willing to work for the chaos beasts."If it was a native human race that had a venerable sovereign and was willing to serve the other party, it seemed to be fine.For example, on the human side, there were demons in some worlds.Li Hao also had demons working for him.These demons could also occupy some positions in human territory.Only then did Kong Ji react and nod,""So you're saying that he's a traitor?""You can't say that,"Li Hao, however, shook his head."They've always been under the rule of chaos beasts. Perhaps they were born to be led by chaos beasts and have long tacitly acknowledged that their leader is a Chaos Beast, so they can't resist. If some of the Chaos Beast sector Lords were slightly better to them ... Then they'd be helpless. They can't choose the environment they're born in. Can you say that Black Panther is a demon?"He didn't think that these people were human traitors, as long as they didn't help the chaos beasts to do evil and kill humans.Some people were born without a choice.Some people didn't even know what the outside world was like. In their eyes, the chaos beasts were the rulers. What could they do?The Black Panther wagged its tail and didn't say anything.Kong Ji thought for a while, nodded, and exhaled.""You're right ... You're right. I don't have such an experience, and I don't have such a mindset. I feel that these guys who mix around with beasts of primordial chaos are a disgrace to the human race ... But if it's as you said, that they were born like this, it seems ... There's nothing I can do.""I'm not sure." He laughed."When I saw that human land and even communicate with the chaos beasts in a friendly manner, I felt like ... Killing someone!" It's even more impulsive than killing a Chaos Beast. "Li Hao also laughed,"that's normal!" However, it's fine if they're only serving the other party. If they're helping the other party to slaughter the human race, then no matter if they're forced or not, they should be killed. Of course, they might not think so. "

Chapter 3159 Ambition (2)
Kong Ji nodded again.At this moment, he was much more open-minded, and he couldn't help but look at Li Hao a few more times.Sometimes, Li Hao was more open-minded than others. Others might not have been so immersed in it."How do we get in now?"Kong Ji looked into the distance."Should we look around or go in? is the Black Panther pretending to be a Beast of Chaos from the outside or the Dragon field?"He didn't stop Li Hao from coming, but he felt that it was a waste of time.,m Some of Silvermoon's venerable sovereigns had left by themselves.Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and a few other middle-stage venerable sovereigns led a team and some other venerable sovereigns to look for a suitable world in secret. Of course, they wouldn't make a move right away. Instead, they were waiting for Li Hao's decision.These people all had Li Hao's little virtual worlds, which were barely connected to the river of time. However, they were too far away to be able to contact each other. For now, they could only communicate within a certain range.Just this point alone was already very strong.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Almost all of Silver moon's martial masters had asked to leave on their own, and Li Hao did not force them to. Clearly, they had all taken his words to heart and hoped that they could forge their own path and share some of Li Hao's burden.As for the Silvermoon world itself, it was still in the stomach of the Black Panther, and the world was filled with Silvermoon people who had yet to become emperors.Li Hao was in no hurry to respond to Kong Ji. Instead, he waited for a while, and when he saw more venerable sovereigns landing in the world, he couldn't help but ask,""There seem to be more venerable sovereigns in the Dragon field than in other places. It's not bad for tianfang world to have one venerable sovereign every month. There's nothing much going on in the fire Phoenix World. It's just a daily exchange, but several venerable sovereigns have come in such a short time!"He had thought that beasts of primordial chaos did not like to communicate.The result wasn't like that.Not only that, but there were also venerable sovereigns of the monster race!The demon race and the Beasts of Chaos were easy to distinguish in the chaos. The Beasts of Chaos were almost integrated with the chaos, while the demon race was similar to the human race. They were slightly isolated. From a distance, one did not need to distinguish anything else to tell whether the other party was a demon or a Beast of Chaos.In this firephoenix world, there were not only humans but also demons ... The Dragon Lord seemed to have the intention of accepting all rivers into the sea. However, the Dragon Realm's suppression of the human race was probably also very fearful.The survival ability of the human race was too strong. With too many people, it was easy for a large number of powerhouses to appear."Black Panther, you're pretending to be an outsider ... An outsider Beast of Chaos, don't pretend to be from the Dragon field. We don't know much about this ... We'll hide in your belly."Heibao nodded, but he was still a little worried.This was because it was more used to Li Hao's commands. Although Li Hao was still here, he was in its stomach. There were experts everywhere, so the Black Panther was a little nervous."It's fine. Don't worry. Have you forgotten that years ago, I was also hiding in your belly to deal with the Xu family ... In the blink of an eye, we were all in the chaos. Weren't you very bold back then?"The Black Panther seemed to have recalled this matter. It bared its teeth and wagged its tail.That's true!There's nothing to be afraid of?"It's best to get a complete map of the Dragon field for this trip to the inferno Phoenix World," Li Hao said."Also, find out the specific strength of the other worlds and the number of Level Seven venerable sovereigns. Besides that ... There's one more important thing!" Li Hao paused for a moment before he said,'will the dragon world leave? Pay close attention to the movements of the dragon world. If the dragon world doesn't leave, we can fight here on a small scale, but it's too difficult to make a big move. "If the Dragon Lord didn't leave, the other party's control over the Dragon field would be too strong.Moreover, he was the absolute leader. He could mobilize a large number of seventh rank venerable sovereigns to encircle and annihilate them at any time. Stirring up trouble here was almost the same as courting death."Yes."Heibao responded.Li Hao didn't pay much attention at first. After a while, he was stunned and looked at Black Panther.The Black Panther didn't seem to notice anything unusual. After a long time, it seemed to come back to its senses. All of a sudden, its fur stood on end. It turned to look at Li Hao, its eyes wide open, as if something big had happened!Li Hao also looked at it, dumbfounded. This dog ... F * cking can really talk?This dog had been silent all this while. Now that it was a rank five venerable sovereign, it still didn't say anything. Li Hao began to doubt himself. Perhaps this dog was of a different breed and really couldn't speak. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been able to hold back all this time.But now ... It clearly responded to me!"Heibao, you can talk!"Li Hao's eyes were unfriendly, while Black Panther shook his head innocently.He wouldn 't.Li Hao frowned and looked at it. After a long while, he said,""What the hell? you, why can't you talk? You just had to call ..."He was speechless.This dog, what bad habit.It was able to suppress its anger to the level of a fifth stage venerable sovereign, yet it still did not open its mouth to speak. Everyone around it was talking, but it was the only one who did not make a sound. This fellow was a real dog!How could he endure this!Black Panther shook his head again and said nothing.Li Hao felt a little strange. Why?He didn't really understand.He was sure that he didn't hallucinate just now. This dog must have responded to him. Although it was only an "en", it was definitely not a dog's grunt, although dogs could also grunt a few times.At the side, Kong Ji laughed.He also sized up the Black Panther and said to Li Hao telepathically,""Fellow Daoist Black Panther didn't say anything ... Perhaps he felt that if he did, he wouldn't be able to hang out with you, Haoyue."What kind of bullsh * t logic was this?Li Hao looked at him speechlessly, and Kong Ji continued to say,""If you can talk, then you're a true intelligent venerable sovereign. Venerable sovereign...You've grown up, it's time to go."
