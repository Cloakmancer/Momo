A grade-9 expert walked out, and in an instant, his aura shook the heavens and earth.He was already strong to begin with, but at this moment, he was suddenly 30% stronger!Tian Fang frowned slightly.The man's eyes were cold, and the Qi of life and death was spreading from his body. It was the life and death Emperor. He looked around and sneered,""At this point, what is there to be afraid of? Even if I die in the battle of spirit ignition today, I won't let it go to anyone! Since he didn't know who was his enemy, then ... He would kill them all! Whether it's Tian Fang, Li Hao, Fang ping, or Su Yu, you can all be killed!"As soon as these words came out, everyone's expression changed.Even the Tribulation seemed to be slightly startled. This guy ...He was really burning his spirit!The life death Emperor seemed to have lost all hope.He sneered and disappeared in an instant. He went straight to Su Yu and the others, and his voice echoed,""Tribulation, help me stop them. I'll kill that man and take back my Dao of death. No one here today can leave easily!"Behind Su Yu, the Lord of undead frowned slightly and attacked instantly!BOOM!The sky fell and the earth cracked. A loud rumble was heard.The powerful Lord of Dead spirits was not weak. He had more than 40 great Dao. If he converted it into an irregular Dao, he was at least comparable to a cultivator with 6000 to 7000 Dao laws.However, his opponent was a ninth-grade spirit ignition cultivator!It was extremely powerful!"Kill them!" Su Yu's eyes turned cold."Kill them!" BOOM!One book after another appeared, countless divine words shaking the world.These people actually wanted to make a move on him first. He originally thought that by cutting off time, these people would completely give up. He didn't expect that these tier 9 experts would go crazy in their despair and want to kill everyone!At this moment, another Grade 9 spiritual beast appeared. It instantly ignited its spirit and charged straight at the human King."Yin Yang!" The human King looked at the man and laughed.It was the Yin Yang path master!The Yin Yang path master, on the other hand, had a calm expression on his face. He simply looked at them and approached them rapidly."Killing you guys and taking the neo martial Yin Yang might even help me extend my lifespan and restore some spirituality! "In the past, we were able to reach grade-9 because we experienced life and death. However, we are old now ... And we are afraid of death! I've always hoped that time could make us immortal and let us recover to our peak ..." Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ In the end, it was all for nothing!Since that was the case, he would give up on this unrealistic fantasy.Go all out!Kill the human King, seize the new martial arts, and extend my life!"Spring and autumn!"Someone laughed in a low voice."The Dao of life and death is not bad either. Since you're here, don't leave. Let's play together!"In an instant, two grade-9 cultivators stepped out with burning spirit!All the tier 9 experts seemed to have gone completely crazy. Tian Fang watched on with a slight frown. He looked off into the distance at the Tribulation. Originally, no one would have gone so crazy. However, the Tribulation had incited them over and over again. Now that they knew that they didn't have much time left, and that their spirituality was gone, they all went crazy with the thought of dying together.If this continued ... Perhaps, they would really have to fight to the death today.There were also grade-9 cultivators who charged at Yuan Shuo. Someone shouted,""Your disciple's shameless scheme was the only reason he killed the five elements! You can only rely on your disciple to force your way into the 8th rank, even into the fake 9th rank, how can you be on the same level as us? Since Li Hao isn't going to come out, how can he not come out after killing you?""Who are you talking about?" Yuan Shuo cursed."Trash will always be trash. When we entered the ninth-rank, we were all attacked with a blade and a spear. What are you relying on?"That person's words were filled with contempt. At this moment, light and darkness appeared at the same time. He sneered,"Yuan Shuo, you're nothing but an ant. It's your honor to kill you. I'll kill Li Hao when he comes out!"As soon as he finished speaking, light and darkness appeared!Behind him, Silvermoon and the other experts appeared, each of them with a serious expression as they rushed toward Yuan Shuo.This group of tier 9 experts actually went crazy first!"Kill huntian and take his spirit!"At this moment, several more grade-9 experts charged at huntian.Huntian's aura trembled. At this moment, he cursed in his heart. This is bad. These tier 9 experts don't have much time left. They've all gone crazy and are determined to die. They just want to get entangled with me ... It's hard for me to bear.He couldn't help but shout,"Li Hao's strength has recovered. He's been wandering in the dark. He must have a plan. You guys will benefit him if you fight with us ...""Tianfang is very powerful," he said."Tianfang world has always existed, so it must have a plan. Even if you kill us, you won't benefit in the end!"At this moment, he only wanted to completely muddy the waters!Since they were all crazy, why not drag them down together!At that time, it would depend on who could last until the end.……At this moment, there were indeed a few Grade 9 experts around the tianfang master.They didn't speak.He didn't make a move.However, the grade-9 experts looked at him silently. After a long time, someone said,""Brother tianfang, we trusted you back then and entered the depths of chaos with you. We took root in the chaos great Dao and sealed ourselves for a million years!""And now ... The time you've been waiting for is gone. We ... Want an explanation!"You want an explanation?"Everyone, what explanation do you want?" Tian Fang asked softly.The stage nine leader was extremely calm."Since time has completely collapsed, everyone has no way out. Brother tianfang, you are the strongest and have the most spirituality. Why don't you ... Share some with everyone? you have already lived for two million years! You're not willing to help and have been perfunctory all this time. Why don't you ... Give it to everyone and we'll help you complete your Grand future!"Tian Fang laughed."You guys ... Want to kill me?"Give them some spirituality!Wasn't this the same as killing him?

3801 Chapter 614
They were really crazy."It's brother tianfang ... Who didn't give us a way out!""Do you really think everyone is a fool? It's just that all along, everyone thought that the appearance of time could really solidify chaos. Even if you had some ideas, no one would necessarily do anything about it ... But you, you've broken our hope!""Do you know what despair feels like?"The grade-9 experts were filled with hatred and went crazy.We don't care what you're planning.We've all been with you for a million years!"In the end, time is gone. You're so calm and confident. Does it mean that, just like the calamity said, you've always been very intelligent?Since that was the case ...Then I'll force you to reveal your true colors!"Brother tianfang, please be on your way!""Kill!" The leader of the cultivators let out a low growl and burned his spirit. He charged toward Tian Fang instantly, and several grade-9 cultivators attacked at the same time!Tian Fang frowned slightly.It disappeared quickly, but in an instant, it was as if it had been locked down. The void trembled, and a grade nine appeared. The spirit of the great Dao trembled, as if the entire chaos was shaking.Not only that, but these people seemed to have planned and thought about how to deal with Tian Fang.In the sky, extremely thick Dao laws appeared.The power of the seal spread in all directions.Not only that, chains after chains swiftly pierced through the heavens and the earth. Tian Fang's figure appeared and he raised his brows slightly."It looks like you've long harbored the thought of joining forces to kill me!""Brother tianfang, who doesn't know that you're the number one expert in the chaos? After working together for so many years, if we don't take any precautions ... Then wouldn't we be really stupid!""Chains of order ..." Tian Fang sighed."I didn't expect that you would still have a trick up your sleeve after killing order!" n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  "Years ago, you incited everyone to kill order. It seems that you are very afraid of order. Since that's the case ... Use the chains of order to lock down the void. I'd like to see if you can break the seal!"A chain appeared in the hands of these people almost at the same time. They were all very powerful, as if they were made of Rules of Order.The chains appeared and immediately sealed the surrounding void!Tian Fang didn't say anything. He just looked around, and a great battle erupted.The moment the time limit was broken, this group of people went crazy in despair.He wasn't too surprised. What surprised him was what Li Hao was doing.His master's side was also in danger.Yuan Shuo, who had just absorbed a portion of the five elements Dao, was not weak. However, he was only facing one person at the moment. If there were one or two more tier 9 experts, he would definitely collapse instantly!And Li Hao still hadn't appeared!Where did Li Hao go?……"They're fighting!"At this moment, Li Hao laughed in the distance. The fight had really started.That's right, Shi Guang's death was something that could be expected.Although tier 9 had sealed themselves off for many years and also appeared to be a bit afraid of death, when it came to a real life-and-death battle, there were no weaklings.Fortunately, Su Yu's group had come out with more people. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to deal with them.At this moment, he looked at the chaos great Dao, which seemed to fill the entire chaos. Countless Dao laws shook madly, and under this situation, he could vaguely see a dog that was madly spreading upward.Black Panther!There were many tier 9 cultivators, and while none of them were at the peak, they were all recovering rapidly under the effects of spirit ignition. If this went on, the Silver Moon cultivators led by his teacher would be the first to collapse. Of course, it might be the same as the Spring and Autumn period.On the other hand, the human King and Su Yu's side were slightly stronger. Huntian was also growing crazily. Tian Fang had countless trump cards. These people would probably not be killed so easily.Spring Autumn and silver Moon, on the other hand, were the least safe.He turned his head and looked into the distance. The human King was still struggling to resist the Yin Yang venerable sovereign, while Su Yu was busy fighting the calamity. The remaining cultivators of the myriad world were working together to deal with the few venerable sovereigns.It seemed a little difficult.Li Hao didn't think much of it. These guys might have some trump cards that they hadn't used yet.After all, there were no casualties yet.He looked at the chaos great Dao again and laughed. Suddenly, he began to spread toward the chaos great Dao. In an instant, the experts who were still fighting in the distance were stunned!In the next moment, the chaos great Dao shook violently!Waves of powerful great Dao power surged out.In the great path, the voices of the grade 9 experts rang out."Bastard, you still want to fish in troubled waters!""Li Hao, don't seek your own death. It's fine if you just watch, but you're delusional if you want to go deep into the origin of chaos right now!""You killed the five elements. Do you really think that everyone will forget you?"“……”Even though they were all engaged in a fierce battle, who would forget Li Hao's existence? this guy had taken advantage of the chaos to kill the five elements path master.At this moment, he actually wanted to go deep into the chaos. If he was not careful, he might cut off the law of the great path, which would be the next five elements. Everyone was on guard against him.Li Hao didn't say anything. He continued to move upward. His great Dao shook violently, and waves of powerful great Dao power suppressed him!Even the battle in the distance seemed to have weakened.In front of Li Hao's eyes, countless DAOs were like whips, madly lashing at him!Li Hao's arms were strong. He turned his palms into fists and punched out. Some DAOs were also shaking, but they still firmly blocked his way, not allowing him to continue spreading!Delusional!At this moment, a few tier 9 experts in the distance quickly retreated from the battlefield and headed straight for Li Hao, their eyes cold.He had originally planned to kill the others first before dealing with Li Hao.This guy was seeking his own death!Now that his whereabouts were exposed, he would kill him!Did he really think that he was invincible? As for Li Hao, no one was sure why he had recovered such a powerful combat strength. However, no matter how strong he was, he was not strong enough to kill a stage nine. Five elements had died in vain!A few figures quickly rushed over.As for Li Hao, he was still entangled with the chaos great DAOs and had no intention of retreating.Out of the corner of his eye, he looked into the distance and finally looked at Tian Fang. Tian Fang ... If there were any secrets, they should be in the depths of the origin of chaos. Only this place could bury his secrets.Li Hao was actually a little confused ... What was this guy up to?Whether it was him, the human King, or Su Yu, in the process of their rise, they all had some traces of Tian Fang.This man and war seemed to have always been around them.A million years ago, Zhan he had met this person. What did he say?Perhaps, he would be able to reveal it today.[ps: we'll be done soon. I think it'll take about a week. For now, it should be around the 20th. There's not much difference between the two. I'll tell you in advance.]

Chapter 3802 The Human King (1)
Li Hao had been trying to reach the chaos great Dao.Several ninth level venerable sovereigns charged at Li Hao.At this moment, battles were breaking out everywhere. One after another, powerful auras swept across the world. Compared to the last time, there were more powerful cultivators this time. Moreover, almost everyone had the battle strength of the peak of the chaotic heaven realm.Neo martial, Silver Moon, and myriad world were all involved in the battle. Human King, Emperor Yu, and Yuan Shuo were all fighting ninth level powerhouses alone.Chunqiu, huntian, and tianfang were also fighting those Grade 9 experts.More than 20 type 9 powerhouses were scattered in different directions. They were the most powerful party at the moment. Everyone was plotting, and so were the group of type 9 powerhouses. However, Tian Fang was the leader in the past.They didn't plan much.When the time Force dissipated and they were unable to recover to their peak state, these people went completely mad!Some were true and some were false.Of course, there were still a few grade-9 cultivators who were hesitating. They didn't join the battle but were hesitant.What to do?Today, even Tian Fang was considered their enemy and their target. These people had a good relationship with Tian Fang, so they didn't know who to help."Li Hao!"In the distance."What the hell are you doing ..." The human King retreated as he fought."If you can't break through the chaos great Dao alone, why don't you come here and join forces to kill the enemy ... After you kill yin and yang, I'll help you kill the others!"Li Hao smiled but didn't say anything.He continued to attack the chaos great Dao.The chaos great Dao shook violently.The level nine venerable sovereigns 'sentience burst forth, shaking the chaos great Dao. Even tianfang master, who was surrounded, couldn't help but shout,""Li Hao, chaos great Dao, support chaos! As for the others, they have reasons to die with you ... You are still young. No matter what, destroying the chaos great Dao shouldn't be your choice ..."If a tier 9 could not afford to play with it, it was understandable that it would be destroyed in the end.Li Hao, what are you charging for?Li Hao laughed faintly,'I want to resurrect a few people ... Just enter the depths of the origin of chaos! I'm not interested in participating in your battle, so what does it matter to me who is the Overlord?" Silence.No one said anything.That was even more impossible.Of course, the origin of chaos was also very powerful. Li Hao might not be able to destroy it, but he still had to be careful. Everyone said that they would die together, but if the origin of chaos was destroyed ... They would really die together!There was no hope at all. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  A tier 9's lifespan wasn't much, but at least there was still a lifespan, right?As soon as he finished speaking, there was a loud bang.Spring and autumn was the first to be at a disadvantage. Countless avatars were destroyed. At this moment, a cicada appeared in the world, carrying some madness, some anger, and some helplessness!"A bunch of bastards!"She cursed.I'm not even ready.Logically speaking, it shouldn't have been so fast. This group of bastards did bad things every day and pushed time forward infinitely, causing her to not really enter the ninth level. Today, she was facing more than one ninth-level enemy! How could he be a match!It was only because she was strong enough and had the help of several top-notch great demons behind her that she was able to fight against her opponent. Her avatars were constantly being torn apart, causing her to be in extreme pain.For a moment, she really wanted to say ..."Ninth-rank, let's be a team!"I'm really not on the same side as Li Hao.Unfortunately ... Now, he was being held up.Who would believe that!It didn't matter whether they believed it or not. What was important was that this group of grade-9 cultivators was here to clean up the battlefield and kill all those who had different opinions and factions!There were signs of defeat on her side."Break!" In the distance, huntian roared as order and chaos regrouped, instantly pushing back the tier 9 experts surrounding him. At this moment, huntian's aura had reached its peak.He looked around and snorted coldly!At this moment, in the vast chaos, he and Tian Fang were the strongest. They were surrounded by several rank nines. The human King and the others were on par with those rank nines, but they showed signs of defeat in a one-on-many battle.The distant Li Hao and the nearby three stage nine experts also quickly arrived. Li Hao's strength was probably not enough to match the three of them.Huntian was fighting and retreating at the same time.He didn't want to have a conflict with them at this moment.In his opinion, time had passed too quickly, and it was too early.It should not be at this moment!How unlucky.Li Hao's group had pushed the time of the arrival of level nine infinitely forward, so that no one was at the peak of their combat strength. Even he would become stronger if he was given more time!What a pity!Huntian thought to himself and cursed in his heart. Li Hao was the real sh * t stirrer.If he had not opened the sky, this would not have happened.……On the other side.Su Yu was fighting with the calamity venerable sovereign. The book of civilization was also extremely powerful and suppressed all directions. However, the calamity was not weak. Even if he was not at his peak, Su Yu was constantly retreating.On the other hand, the life and death Emperor at the back was actually no match for the experts of the myriad world.This group of people had many experts.The Lord of the Undead, the human Emperor of all realms, the Civil King, the martial King, the reincarnated Martial Emperor of the spirit of chaos, Wan Tiansheng, blue sky ...Under the siege of this group of experts, the life and death Emperor was no match for them.They were surrounded by layers of enemies, and only when another level nine venerable sovereign joined the battle did they manage to maintain their level nine power.The myriad world side was holding back three great Grade 9 experts.On the other hand, the new martial arts side could only hold back two tier nines.On Spring autumn's side, he was fighting two tier 9 experts alone.Huntian's strength alone was actually able to fight with four great tier 9 experts.

Chapter 3803 The Human King (2)
Tian Fang had the most experts around him, with five tier 9 experts surrounding him. Silvermoon also had two tier 9 experts surrounding him.The other three went to Li Hao.On the entire battlefield, other than the two who were hesitating, including Tian Fang, 22 type 9 powerhouses had all joined the battle. Including the dead Wuxing and Huanxian, the 26 type 9 powerhouses that had escaped into the depths of the primordial chaos had all appeared.A million years ago, a total of 27 level nine venerable sovereigns were born.The master of order had fallen long ago.That era was incomparably glorious.Today, the biggest war in history had broken out among this group of people, and almost all of them were involved.Back then, there wasn't such a big scene when they besieged order.At this moment, both the human king and emperor Yu seemed to be somewhat powerless. They were both exhausted from fighting a level nine. However, one of them was still crazy while the other was still calm. They had a tacit understanding and did not say much.It was as if he was waiting for something.He could only defend against the strong enemy and at the same time, prevent the other 2 Grade 9 experts from interfering.For a moment, the power of the bed covered the entire world.It was chaos!On the human King's side, the Supreme-being and the others were also struggling to defend against the powerful enemies. At this moment, the Supreme-being looked at the human King several times, but the human King was unmoving like a mountain. He was just like a mad demon as he continued to attack, forcing the Yin Yang path master into a defensive position.​ Although the power of a human King wasn't absolute, at this moment, with his fearlessness, he was still dazzling on the battlefield.The two grade nine experts who were still watching looked at each other and hesitated.The two of them looked at each other ... And then at the crazy human King. Should we ... Go and deal with this guy?Of course, there was no need to separate.Why not ... Destroy neo martial first!Three people had already gone to Li Hao's side, and there were three level nines among the new powerhouses from the myriad world. Only neo martial, which was considered an old-school world among the three worlds, only had two level nines ...The human King was so fierce, why not ... Add something to it!In the next moment, the two 9th tier cultivators who were hesitating said,""Yin Yang, we will help you!"The human King couldn't help but curse,"F * ck!" Do you think I'm easy to bully?"Why?There are so many battlefields and so many battle groups. You two should just watch the show. What right do you have to come to me?Why?Who are you bullying?I don't know you guys, and I didn't offend you guys either. I did offend Li Hao, and that new emperor Yu also killed time. Logically speaking, you guys should be killing them.Do I look like I'm easy to bully?Or why?My neo martial arts looks a little softer?Or what?The human King was unconvinced!He was a little flustered and exasperated."Don't force me to integrate neo martial. After integrating neo martial, you're not at the peak. Do you really think I can't kill you?"The two of them ignored him. There were many reasons for choosing the human King.Huntian and tianfang were both very strong, and everyone was actually a little afraid of them. It was obvious that they didn't need help with spring and autumn, and they didn't want to get involved in the battle between calamity and Emperor Yu either. Calamity wasn't a good person either.As for Silver moon's side, Yuan Shuo, who was leading a group of weaklings to fight against two rank nines, was also in danger and did not need any help.On Li Hao's side, the three rank-9s had gone over. Li Hao was extremely ruthless, and they were actually a little afraid of him.After one round ... Neo martial was the weakest.It's not the weakest, but ... Neo martial artists are only impulsive, crazy, and reckless. Besides these, neo martial doesn't seem to have many trump cards. What else do you know except for the fusion neo martial?In addition, the human King was currently intrepid and had suppressed the Yin Yang path master. The gun hits the bird that takes the lead-who else would he hit if not you! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  The two grade-9 experts quickly joined the battlefield.When the human King saw this situation, he became anxious.Bastard!"You're going too far!"The human King was furious. Three against one, did he have any shame?"Why?" he was furious.“……”Who would explain anything?No reason.Just because you're too arrogant, and you don't look as sinister as those two, is this enough?The human King quickly retreated and tried to approach Emperor Yu. Su Yu's eyes flickered as he retreated while fighting."Come on, don't come to my side. I'm not interested in blocking a knife for you!"This guy was not a good person either.As a cultivator who had observed the rise of new martial arts ... He was not an idiot. Even now, the human King was playing dirty.Who was everyone?He didn't know much about Li Hao, but as for the human King ... Well, he had to admit that time was really nice. Like Li Hao, he also traveled to the new martial arts and observed the chaos experts with the new martial arts as a reference.He understood neo martial too well.The human King couldn't help but curse,"will you die if you help?" Your Dao of myriad worlds has learned a lot of my neo martial arts!"This was true.But at this moment, Su Yu was retreating as he fought. He kept coughing up blood and said weakly,""Human King, don't worry. After I kill this man, I will definitely help you neo martial ... But ... Cough, cough, cough ..."Blood splattered.Su Yu retreated as he was struck by the lightning. His white clothes were stained with dust. He was sad and weak. "It's a pity that we have the intention to kill the thief, but we can't reverse the situation. The experts of our myriad realms have just left the myriad realms today and have actually met with such a disaster ... A calamity has descended. This is the calamity of our myriad realms ..."Go to hell!The human King wanted to curse!Come on!"This kid doesn't look like a good person. I used to use this method of spitting blood and pretending to be weak many times in the past. This guy is learning from me!"Shameless!As soon as he finished speaking, the human King was sent flying backward, spurting out blood non-stop. His bones and bones were broken, and his flesh and blood were flying everywhere. He was in a much more miserable state than Emperor Yu. At this moment, his face was filled with sorrow and helplessness."Damn it ... Three against one ... You're bullying us, the new martial artists, because we have no talent and because we, Fang ping, are incompetent?"

Chapter 3804 The Human King (3)
"If you've got guts, then fight me one-on-one!"He could not shout, but the three rank-9s did not give him any time to shout and quickly pressed forward!These two, one was worse than the other.On the other side, Spring Autumn, who had been beaten to a pulp by a few tier 9 experts, suddenly rejoiced when he saw this scene. 'Fortunately, I'm in a slightly better state than them.'The human King was so pitiful!Who asked this boorish fellow to be so arrogant?Fortunately, those two weren't here for me.In comparison, he was much happier and even a little excited as he fought. Countless past bodies appeared madly and fused into his body. The years withered and withered, and at this moment, those countless past bodies seemed to come alive.When spring and autumn saw that the human king and emperor Yu were in a worse state than her, it was as if his fighting spirit was incited, and the chirping of cicadas could be heard.Time passed.In an instant, her opponent seemed to freeze. However, the two rank 9s quickly charged at her again, forcing Spring Autumn to retreat again. However, the more they fought, the more courageous they became. They shouted,"Everyone, hold on. When I kill the enemy, this King will help you ..."As soon as he said this, spring and autumn was sent flying with a boom. His blood and flesh were muddled, but he recovered in an instant, as if he wanted to show off his strength.Don't be depressed!Don't crash.I'm still here!Once it collapsed, it would be the greatest danger.The human King was extremely miserable. He glanced over ... And secretly clicked his tongue. 'You're so miserable. You've already lost countless clones, yet you're still acting strong.'Why?At this moment, both the human King and Su Yu seemed to be waiting for something.He looked into the distance again!……In the distance.Li Hao, who was still working on the chaos great Dao, glanced in that direction, frowned, and sighed.F * ck!What was going on with these two guys?Wait for me?I'm waiting for you!Why do we have to do this?When did neo martial King become so weak?'That Su Yu of the new heaven could walk out of the land of myriad worlds and tell me that's all he has?Other than blowing up Shi Guang and displaying a bit of madness, that was all?A tribulation and you're already so weak?Li Hao was helpless!At this time, why were they still doing inner conflict?At this moment, the three rank-9s had arrived.Li Hao looked over and saw a familiar face.The few who had protected him last time!What a coincidence.Decay, darkness, Hurricane!These three, the last time long Zhan wanted to kill him, their avatars still came to protect him. In the end, they were all killed by long Zhan. Today, it's good. Ha, these three actually joined forces to kill him. Li Hao looked down at the three of them and smiled."Dao Masters, I haven't had the time to repay you for saving my life last time. Are you here to protect me again today?"At this moment, the rotten Emperor's face was cold.""Li Hao, are you still going to struggle at a time like this?"Last time, the three of them had protected him, but all of his clones had been killed.That time, it was not to protect Li Hao. It was just to kill chaos and not let time become stronger. But Li Hao was not a good person. Later, long Zhan self-destructed, and this guy took the opportunity to stab the clone of the devour path master to death.At this moment, the devouring path master didn't have the time to care about Li Hao. He was dealing with Tian Fang. Otherwise, he would have already come.The three of them were the same.A hurricane appeared and rotted heaven and earth. A shadow seemed to have disappeared in the darkness. Instantly, Li Hao felt the fluctuations of the great path around him. At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat different. His arms were extremely long, but he was somewhat out of balance.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ It only had a pair of long arms, like a long-armed ape.Suddenly, he grabbed the air with his arms, and the air trembled. The great Dao of chaos was also shaking. In an instant, darkness appeared, and a small sword stabbed toward Li Hao's head without a sound! The hurricane swept through, and the decay spread again.With a low shout, Li Hao clenched his fists and hammered the air. BOOM!A loud bang rang out!Li Hao was sent flying away from the chaos great Dao.At this moment, three people appeared from three sides."What other tricks do you have up your sleeve today?" the Dao master of the decay path sneered.At this moment, all the experts had come out.Not a single top-notch expert was absent.Li Hao, do you still have any tricks up your sleeve?At this moment, Li Hao was not in a hurry. Like a breeze, he drifted around and looked into the distance, muttering, if you don't move, I won't move either!I'll drag it out too!The Black Panther had already spread to the depths of the chaos."Su Yu, if you don't kill calamity, I'll fight you today!"What are you all doing?……On the other side.The human King was in an even more miserable state. He roared,"Are you really going to kill me? I've been keeping a low profile, but you guys have gone too far. Three tier 9 experts ganging up on me, a tier 8, where's the Justice in this?"“……”Everyone felt that the human King had gone crazy.At this time, who is talking to you about justice?You're dead!The human King looked left and right. I'm fighting three, Li Hao is fighting three, but that B * stard Li Hao seems to have just started. He's been retreating, while I don't have much of a chance to retreat.It was really ... Infuriating!Good fellow, you all want to be the finale, right?Looking at Tian Fang, that old fogey Tian Fang seemed to have been entangled and was somewhat powerless ... This person was quite good at enduring.On the other hand, the Spring and Autumn period ... Was really tragic.Even the human King could sense it. Who knew how many past incarnations had been destroyed? at this moment, they were getting weaker and weaker as the battle progressed.However, he was still displaying his strength!Chunqiu, your IQ ... Is almost the same as huntian 's."Forget it, I'm old, it's fine if I suffer some losses!"The human King mumbled. The three experts had turned him into a bloody mess and his bones and bones were all broken. At this moment, they were all impressed by the human King's tenacity. He was still able to escape even after fighting for so long. He had some capabilities.

Chapter 3805 Human Emperor_ 4
However, he would only be beaten up!"Everyone is bullying me ..."The human King tried to escape again. At this moment, he wiped the blood off his body and cursed.They appeared in the air, and the three experts appeared once again.The Yin Yang path master sneered.Didn't you want to kill me?Where did his imposing manner go?Now, what are you afraid of?"Yin Yang, what are you laughing at!" The human King sighed.The Yin Yang path master glared at him coldly. In the next moment, he disappeared, and the Yin Yang grinding plate appeared. It pressed down and obliterated this foul-mouthed fellow.In addition to being ruthless, the neo martial human King also had a vicious mouth!Be it Li Hao or Su Yu, although they knew how to speak, they usually didn't curse directly. Only the human King would really curse directly and never be polite.At this moment, the human King didn't care about him.He looked into the distance and suddenly laughed."I'll give you a start so that you can know who the real master is. You Little Rascals, learn!"At this moment, Li Hao, Su Yu, and Tian Fang all looked at him.He even ignored his opponent.What was the human King hiding?  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ In fact, they were all a little curious. Even Su Yu, who had been observing neo martial arts, was a little curious. There were some things that he did not know. When he left, neo martial arts had just come out of chaos. He did not know how the human King had developed and what the human King had done in the past thousand years.What had the human King been doing for the past thousand years?Had he been in seclusion all this time?Such a lively person had actually been in closed-door cultivation for a thousand years until the incident of the red moon. Only then did he leave the neo martial world and the small square region. Was this the habit of a human King?At that moment, the human King's smile disappeared.Suddenly, he looked at the endless void and sighed.""It's been a thousand years ..."A thousand years, how long was that!For the past thousand years, you've been hiding your names and identities, which makes me a little sad."Where's the mcmau crowd!"With a low shout, the world seemed to change color.The whistling sound resounded through the sky.At that moment, the weather seemed to change.Mcmau ... The martial arts university that had been passed down for thousands of years seemed to have disappeared from neo martial arts. No one had ever seen mcmau again, appearing in the world.At this moment.Heaven and earth seemed to have been waiting for this moment. In an instant, many experts from countless worlds appeared. As if they had turned into darkness, they hid in all directions!"Magic City Martial Arts university, all members, assemble!""Fight, fight, fight!"Countless voices whizzed out. In the distance, Supreme Emperor Tian Fang looked around and raised his eyebrows slightly. Not bad. Neo martial really sent out many people, but ... They were not too strong.So what if they occupied hundreds of worlds? He fell into deep thought.He wasn't surprised that neo martial arts had sent out a group of people. Neo martial artists liked to travel everywhere. As soon as they knew that there were other worlds, neo martial artists had explored everywhere.After so many years, it was not a big deal for a group of people to come out and secretly control some weak worlds.That was only a hundred or so worlds!There were probably over ten thousand people.To the entire chaos, this was a drop in the bucket. There were so few people, and there were probably hundreds of venerable sovereigns. But ... What was this?There seemed to be only a small number of grade-7 ones.Most of them were weak venerable sovereigns.Was this the trump card of the human King?Su Yu also frowned slightly. There were many people in all directions, but ... They were all very weak.This old senior only had this much?He was a little disappointed!In the distance, Li Hao quickly dodged the dark path master's sword and frowned.Human King, I have great hopes for you."In the end ... The surrounding worlds, tens of thousands of people, hundreds of worlds, this is not your style.If that was all there was to it ... It was far from enough.The three type 9 powerhouses who had joined forces to attack him were initially startled, but when they sensed the strength of the world around them, they all laughed.The Yin Yang path master laughed so hard that his body swayed."The human King is indeed a brute. I'm so scared. There are tens of thousands of experts and hundreds of venerable sovereigns. There are a total of eight Level seven and one level eight. We were all scared to death!"Was he very strong?Yes, he was quite strong.In fact, it was a little unbelievable. In just a short thousand years, so many people had been hidden. It was not ordinary.But ... It really wasn't enough!With so few people, they could kill them all by themselves very quickly, leaving no one alive.The human King ignored him.He looked around and smiled gently. He looked at the high-level experts in the distance. One of them was his wife, the well-known concubine who was also a level Seven venerable sovereign.There was his sister, Fang Yuan. That little round-faced girl who had always followed him around had also grown up.There was his teacher ... His real teacher was not longevity sword, but Lu fengrou, that overbearing woman. At this moment, she and her husband, mcmau's Vice-Chancellor, the Snake King Wu kuishan, were all among them. They were all people from neo martial arts and mcmau.There were also old friends, old classmates, and teachers who he had not seen in a long time.These were the comrades he had grown up with from the very beginning.Of course, it was the same for those who stayed behind.But this group of people, perhaps, was the last soft spot in his heart. They had all appeared and returned."They ... They look down on you ..."The human King laughed. Someone is looking down on you, what should you do?At this moment, from all directions, worlds flew towards the human King at an unbelievable speed. It was as if they had crossed space and time!

Chapter 3806 The Human King (3)
Those worlds ... Were actually like seeds, slightly different from the other worlds.These worlds ... Seemed to be completely connected with the neo martial artists.At that moment, a small world appeared above the human King's Head. It was very small, not big at all. It was as if ... It was only the size of a school. There were even some words appearing on it.Magic City Martial Arts university!It was a school."The world is not about the big ... Mcmau is within the square inch ..."The human King mumbled to himself. At this moment, the three powerful beings had made their move. Even though they did not know what the human King was up to, or rather, they were hoping that the weak would do something, they would not let the human King succeed! The three of them quickly took action!It pressed down on the human King! no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  No matter what you were thinking, they wouldn't give you a chance. You would only die."All DAOs are mine. Dao is me, I am Dao. Heaven and earth are me, I am heaven and earth. The realm is me, I am the realm ... You don't understand me!"He looked into the distance and smiled. They understand me!"The seeds ... Will blossom and bear fruit!"He mumbled in his sleep. At this moment, his body suddenly collapsed. The three powerful experts 'suppression actually hit nothing with a loud boom!At this moment, the illusionary image of Magic City Martial Arts university above his head suddenly bloomed like a lotus flower.In the distance, the hundreds of worlds were like seeds or lotus seeds. They instantly passed through the defenses of the three powerful cultivators and landed on the Lotus disc!At that moment, as the Lotus seeds returned to their original positions, the entire Pocket World seemed to undergo some extremely faint changes.It was like a Green Lotus, swaying between heaven and earth.It was rooted in the world!Tens of thousands of cultivators landed on the Lotus seed in an instant. Their eyes were filled with anticipation, worship, desire, and respect.Fang ping, the king of the human race, the God of mcmau!At this moment, the green Lotus swayed and suddenly, like a bud waiting to bloom, the original lotus seed fused into one in an instant."To the human King!"A unified voice resounded from the Lotus plate. In an instant, flowers began to fall one after another, causing the entire world to seem to be submerged in a sea of flowers.The three top powers were attacking madly, but their vision was blocked by the falling flowers.Indistinctly, in the center of the flower, a child appeared. It was also like a seed that was rapidly growing. There seemed to be a person sleeping inside.At this moment, in the distance, the Lord of calamity roared,""Stop him!"He did not know what Fang ping was doing, but he could vaguely feel the aura of a calamity. This was a sign of a disaster, and it was not a good thing.It was as if the other party's inner world was turning into a seed and maturing.It was about to blossom and bear fruit!What was this Fang ping cultivating?"Dao fuse with me, I fuse with Dao. The world is me, I am the world, inner world ... There is no inner world, there is no inner world ... The flower blossoms and bears fruit, and that is me!" It seemed to be explaining, but also mocking.Crack ... Crack ...The entire world seemed to have shattered.It was as if Magic City Martial Arts university had crumbled. At this moment, those tens of thousands of cultivators seemed to be welcoming the arrival of a Saint.The three powerhouses erupted one after another!The aura shook heaven and earth, destroying the countless flower petals. In the blink of an eye, the three of them were close to each other, and all of them breathed sighs of relief. Thankfully, no matter what they did, as long as they could get close, it would be fine."Bring peace to the world within a few inches!""Saber!"With a chuckle, the big cat in the distance suddenly meowed. In an instant, a long knife with a cartoon character on it appeared. A cat head was carved on the handle.It was so lifelike that it looked like a real cat's head.In fact, it was a real cat's head.In an instant, the power of darkness, the power of filth, the power of Chaos ...It was as if the evilest power in the world had emerged on the long blade. In an instant, it rotted in all directions and a foul smell spread throughout the world. This was the dirty power that the cat had devoured over the years.It was the source of filth!The three powerhouses also smelled the stench. For a moment, they actually felt dizzy and shocked!What was this?It was so dirty and vicious ..."Four-sided domain, the root of chaos, chaos ... It's too stinky. It's been so many years. Haven't you noticed that the entire chaos seems to have become much cleaner in the past thousand years?"Fang ping walked out from the center of the petals. At this moment, he was actually naked, with only that saber on him.He didn't know shame and just laughed."The root of chaos is here. The darkness of chaos is here ... In the past thousand years, the square domain has been so clean. Even the entire chaos has become much cleaner. You ... Have to thank me!"As for the 100 worlds, they were just activating the origin power of heaven and earth.At this moment, holiness and darkness appeared on his body.The power of Yin and yang rose to an extreme peak in the blink of an eye."My yin and yang, you try it!"As soon as he finished speaking, the saber was drawn!Yin and yang appeared, one black and one white. This was no longer yin and yang, this was evil and Holy!Fang ping, who was born from the flower petals, seemed to have gathered the purest power in the world. However, the long saber in his hand had gathered the evilest power in the world. The old cat, the source of evil!The collision of evil and holiness!The three experts were shocked, but they quickly calmed down. He wasn't weak. The current human King was probably stronger than them alone, but the three of them had joined forces!

Chapter 3807 Human Emperor_ 6
This was also their greatest relief.It was still alright!The three of them attacked at the same time. The Yin Yang path master snorted coldly. 'You've really hidden your strength well, but that's all you've got in the end. Human King, is this all you've got?The blade fell!BOOM!The loud sound resounded in all directions. At this moment, it was as if countless cheers and countless neo martial artists were cheering and roaring!However, the three powerhouses only fell back a little.The Yin Yang path master sneered.He was very strong!He managed to force three of them back with a single slash, but ... It's not enough to kill me!His spirituality was burned to the extreme, and his aura became even more majestic. His cold laughter resounded,""Fang ping, that's it!"The millstone emerged and instantly pressed down on Fang ping!The remaining two attacked from the left and right.They were shocked just now, but now they were at ease.It was alright!However, it was not enough.At that moment, the calamity path master's expression changed. He had sensed the arrival of a calamity earlier, but it had not been so obvious. However, at that moment, he suddenly felt an extremely dense power of calamity being born!What?"If Fang ping is going to die, why do I feel like I'm in trouble?He didn't understand what was going on, but just as he was about to shout out a warning, the void around him seemed to have been sealed. Emperor Yu, who had been retreating the entire time, seemed to have been placed inside a book, and all his voice was completely sealed."It's not your business." He smiled and shook his head."It's not your business!"The Tribulation was shocking!He hurriedly turned his head and looked towards the human King. One against three, although the human King was strong, he shouldn't be able to turn the tables. Did he have a backup plan?What backup plan?The moment the human King's saber descended and the Yin Yang path master attacked, the human King's eyes suddenly widened as he looked behind the three of them!It was as if he was saying,"there's something behind you!"The three of them ignored him!Who would believe that?This little trick of yours is too low-end!However, at this moment, the Tribulation was seen, and its eyes instantly widened!Behind the three of them, a black shadow suddenly appeared. The black shadow ... Actually looked extremely similar to the human King!It felt like a clone of the human King.The darkness enveloped the three of them, and they instantly felt that something was amiss. However, it was too late. The darkness invaded them, and in an instant, the Yin Yang path master felt a sharp pain in his back!A pitch-black arm pierced through his heart and grabbed onto something. With a squeeze of its bare hand, it broke it!The great Dao!The human King brandished his long blade and slashed down. The head of the Yin Yang path master flew up with a dazed expression.Who was behind him?Human King?That was impossible! Absolutely impossible!It definitely wasn't the human King 'S. He was certain. He could also sense some differences. It was different from the madness of the human King. Behind it, there was only endless dark power!Was it the dark path master?But wasn't he dealing with Li Hao?Why did you suddenly appear behind me?You even sneak attacked me!This was impossible!Behind him, the man smiled evilly. Suddenly, he grabbed the head and turned it to face him. After looking at each other, he grinned, revealing his white teeth. "I'm Fang Wushuang! My father is called Fang ping!"The Yin Yang path master was at a loss!What?'Fang Ping's ... Son? How was that possible?Where did the son of a human King come from? even if he did, he couldn't be so strong that he could sneak an attack on him without any warning!And at this moment, the human King laughed.His smile was exactly the same as his opponent 's!There were some sighs, some emotions, some reminiscence, and some longing."I'm back!""I'm back!"That Smurf human King also grinned and nodded. He had returned.In an instant, the two of them charged towards the other Dao master, one in front and one behind. The other was shocked. He couldn't believe it and roared,""How is that possible?"So what if you have a son?But why ... Is he not weaker than you? no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  This was impossible!In the chaos, it was impossible for an expert to be born without a sound. Any expert's appearance would have some signs. Even the future Su Yu had signs. How could there be no movement at all?In the distance, Li Hao also widened his eyes!The human King had turned his inner world into a seed that blossomed and bore fruit. He actually felt that this was the human King's trump card. It was stronger than before. Although he could still take on three people, he might not lose!It was a good thing!This trump card was not weak.But ... What the hell was that Viscount of darkness that had suddenly appeared?He couldn't help but look at the dark path master. Why ... Does it seem like your ability?The dark path master was also at a loss. At this moment, he couldn't even care about Li Hao. He looked in that direction and was extremely confused."Impossible! I wouldn't be completely unaware of the appearance of such a dark power. I would definitely have sensed it!"He was the dark path master!This kind of dark power was not any weaker than his. How could he not sense it at all?However, the truth was that he knew nothing about it before!Until today!In the distance, Tian Fang seemed to have realized something. He suddenly looked at the human King and sighed after a long time.So ... You've found out!As for the human King, he chuckled, his laughter piercing through the heavens and earth!"Li Hao, I've said it before. Father and son are soldiers in battle. I'm old, but I have a son ... Do you have one?""Hahaha!"His maniacal laughter resounded through the world.As for Li Hao, he was stunned at first. Then, he came to a realization. In the past, neo martial arts were surrounded by darkness, and he seemed to have understood something.He could not help but laugh."Human King ... The world belongs to the young. You ... You're old!""F * ck your Grandpa!"The human King roared. With a furious roar, it seemed to have transformed into his absolute domain within a square inch!The two Dao Masters who were trapped were shocked and shouted,""Help me!"Something was going to happen!They were not too afraid of one Fang ping, but now that another person who was not weaker than Fang ping had appeared, they would really die if they were afraid!"It's too late!"The long blade pierced through everything. In an instant, the long blade turned into a glove. In the blink of an eye, the human King sent out over 10000 punches, forcing one of them to retreat. In an instant, darkness enveloped him, and without a sound, a palm pierced through his body!The mini human King grinned again, as if he was showing off and asking for credit.The human King grinned and nodded."Good job! You didn't waste all these years!"The last person seemed to have realized something. He looked at the two in disbelief."No... This is impossible ..."BOOM!It was as if heaven and earth had exploded. In an instant, the father and son had joined forces and smashed him into pieces!"What's impossible about that?"the human King chuckled.That alt account human King mimicked him and chuckled. "What's impossible? My father is invincible!"Boom! Boom! Boom!The sound of an explosion reverberated in all directions.The human King had completed three kills.

3808 Chapter 616
(I'm going to release one chapter on Saturday today. I'll continue tomorrow. If I write too fast, I'm afraid I won't be able to finish it on the 20th. I promised the website that I'd finish on the 20th.)"Well done, son!"At this moment, the human King laughed and was madly devouring the power of the great DAOs left behind by the three great cultivators after they died.All around, everyone's faces paled.The three of them died? how could this be?The human King, where did he get a son from?And he had such a powerful son!This was impossible. How could a top-notch expert be born out of thin air? this did not make sense.Such an expert's strength was almost equivalent to a human King.One had to know that the human King had participated in many wars and invaded many worlds to get to where he was today. The entire eighth-rank world in the East had almost been devoured by the human King. In the end, his son had silently become as powerful as the human King.This was impossible!Those Grade 9 powerhouses all had faces of disbelief.As for Paragon sky square, he glanced at the human King and didn't say anything. He quickly avoided the encirclement of the others and fell into deep thought.……In the distance.Li Hao also fell into deep thought. After a long time, he suddenly smiled and murmured,""You're really shameless!"Son?The human King was shameless at times. Where did he get a son from? At this moment, The Dark Emperor was also sensing something. He sensed the expert who had suddenly appeared. At this moment, his expression changed slightly as he looked in that direction.The little human King, who called himself Fang Wushuang, also looked at him from afar.He bared his teeth and smiled, just like the human King!The Dark Emperor was stunned. His expression changed slightly as he muttered,""No... This is ... The dark side ... This is yin and yang ..."Beside him, decay and Hurricane said hurriedly,""What?"The Dark Emperor looked in that direction again. At this moment, he couldn't even care about Li Hao."This is the Yin Yang face...So...The Yin Yang face really exists. How is this possible...Human King, how is it possible to find it?"He seemed to have fallen into a state of confusion.The two grade-9 experts couldn't wait, what did they mean?At this moment, in the distance, Supreme Emperor Tian Fang dodged the attacks of the devourers and said softly,""Human King, I didn't expect you to really find it. It seems like it has something to do with battle, right?"The human King laughed heartily,"what?" Tian Fang, are you complimenting my son's strength?"He laughed and said,"my son is unparalleled, unparalleled chaos. How about it?" I'm very pleased that the student has surpassed the master!"Tian Fang laughed and said softly,"two sides as one. Human King ... I'm just a little curious. Can you ... Completely merge with him?"The human King laughed heartily,"what the hell?" Do you think I have to be nice to everyone? He's my son, why should I melt him?"Tian Fang didn't say anything else.However, he seemed to have concluded that Fang Wushuang was not the son of the human King.……At the same time.Su Yu also kept retreating and continued to fight with the calamity. As for venerable sovereign calamity, his face changed again and again, and he muttered to himself,""Two sides as one, battle, time ... Two poles ..."He mumbled to himself as if he knew something. His face kept changing. Which Dao was the strongest in the Dao of chaos?No one knew.Was time really invincible?That might not be the case!Someone as strong as Tian Fang was truly invincible in the Dao of space?That might not be the case!The others were just at a different level. If they were all like him and had all DAOs, who would dare to say that their DAOs were invincible?However, it was publicly acknowledged that the Dao that could allow many people to enter Grade 9 was the Dao of two extremes.Or rather ... The opposing Dao.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Life and death, yin and yang, chaotic order, recovery from death, light and darkness ...These were all opposing DAOs, the DAOs of the two extremes.This was also a point that all powerhouses acknowledged. If one cultivated the Dao of the two extremes at the same time, they would be stronger.And among the macro worlds, which one was stronger?Two-Dao universe!For example, new martial, or Silver Moon!At this moment, Su Yu's expression changed slightly, as if he had thought of something. At the end of neo martial, there was actually a netherworld. In the past, the netherworld was used to accommodate the dead strong.In other words, it was used to contain experts who still had their spirituality and origin.After they died, their yin and yang reversed and they lived in another world. However, later on, the human King resurrected them and did not hesitate to consume a lot of Yang Qi, causing the entire neo martial arts to have too much Yin Qi!However, as those people were resurrected, the neo martial netherworld seemed to have disappeared completely.No one mentioned this again. They all felt that since people were already alive, there was no need for there to be a netherworld.Su Yu had also observed it before, but ... The later stage of the netherworld was almost crippled, and no one entered it again. The yin and yang world of neo martial arts was later integrated and no longer distinguished between yin and yang!At this moment, he seemed to have understood something.His eyes flickered.Two sides as one!It was all Fang Ping's fault!This guy even gave himself a new name!This was ... The master of the netherworld!The real master of the netherworld, the entire neo martial world, and countless Yin Qi had been devoured by this person. This was also one of the key factors for those people to be able to revive and quickly absorb Yang Qi. Human King ... He had devoured all the dark aura and Yin death aura!Fang Wushuang had achieved it!That was the other side of the human King.As for the human King ... He actually came from the netherworld. In the past, he had been pulled out by Zhan Tiandi and the Yang God with unique means. The netherworld was somewhat related to the Yang God and Zhan Tiandi.In fact, the human King was not from neo martial yang realm!……At this moment, some people seemed to understand.However, he still had some doubts.Why ... Could the human King cultivate an equally powerful netherworld side? even if the neo martial netherworld still existed, it had always been sealed by the human King's inner world. Logically speaking, it could only be regarded as one of the avatars and should not be so powerful.

3809 Chapter 616
Unless ...There were some unforeseen events in this.Furthermore, if these two extreme DAOs were to be completely fused, they should be extremely powerful. Why ... Did the human King want to separate? even now, he kept calling them his sons, but had never fused them together?They didn't understand.However, at this moment, as the three great cultivators were killed by the human King, and the human King was madly absorbing the power of the great DAOs of the yin and yang, the others were also anxious.Unexpectedly, it was the human King's side that collapsed first!The key was that the ones who collapsed were three tier 9 powerhouses!At this moment, the situation changed.Venerable sovereign of calamity bombarded Su Yu crazily, forcing Su Yu to retreat step by step. However, his face was ugly.There were many grade-9 experts!More than 20.But now, three of them had been killed at once. The situation had changed greatly. This group of tier 9 experts had not been able to take down their opponents. This was especially so for tianfang and huntian. They had a total of nine tier 9 experts, and they were fighting two people. Yet, they could not take them down.As for Li Hao ... Although the three from the dark side had the advantage, they couldn't take him down.How could it be like this!This group of people seemed to be stronger than expected. At this moment, the human King was absorbing the power of Yin and yang at the same time as Fang Wushuang. If this continued, they might become stronger!"Two sides as one ..."He mumbled to himself and suddenly looked at Tian Fang in the distance.Tian Fang was as calm and collected as ever. Even if the five experts had locked him down, even if no one had recovered to their peak, even if he was only a little stronger than everyone else.However, at this moment, he was still so calm even when it was one against five."Tian Fang!""You!" Calamity suddenly roared,"we have been sealed together for a million years. Could it be that, in your eyes, this group of newbies is more worthy of your trust than us?"At this moment, the situation had changed.He had to think of a way to deal with it!This group of people was harder to deal with than expected. They clearly had the absolute advantage in numbers, but at this moment, they felt like they were at a disadvantage."Dark ... What are you guys still doing?"He roared!He was very annoyed. Su Yu was strong, and it was very difficult for him to suppress him alone, but at least he managed to suppress him. On the dark side, three people were suppressing Li Hao, but they couldn't do anything about it.This was too infuriating!If this continued and the human King absorbed the power of Yin and yang, the situation might be reversed. Thinking about this, he looked at huntian and felt something.Huntian had pinned down four tier 9 martial artists!In an instant, he made a decision. He gritted his teeth and growled,""Little friend huntian!"Huntian fought and retreated. At this moment, he was already at the edge of the battlefield. Hearing this, he quickly looked at the Lord of calamity, as if he instantly understood the Lord of calamity's intentions. In this group, Li Hao had a grudge against the Lord of calamity, and Tian Fang was too powerful. He really had the strength to kill everyone.As for him ... He had just barely reached level nine. Although he was also strong, as long as some of these people could recover to their peak, they would not be afraid of him.At that moment, the human King had killed several people.The situation had changed!The Tribulation wanted to form an alliance with him.He quickly came to his senses and considered the pros and cons. He wasn't afraid of many people, but he was afraid of Tian Fang, Li Hao, and the others ... Although they weren't level nine, he was also afraid of them.And at this moment, the human King had even come up with two sides as one. He was also puzzled.In an instant, he retreated for a while and stood in an orderly manner, blocking the encirclement of several experts. His eyes were sharp as he looked at them and said in an extremely deep voice,""Do you still want to kill me?"The few of them also stopped in their tracks.Do you still want to kill huntian?"Go and deal with the human King!" The voice of tribulation sounded again.As soon as these words came out, the few of them hesitated for a moment, but in the next moment, they no longer said anything. They all turned around and headed straight for the human King.The expression of the human King, who was currently absorbing energy, changed drastically when he saw this. He couldn't help but curse,""It's me again! Am I really that easy to bully? Chunqiu is about to be beaten to death, you guys can go and beat her up! Su Yu, Yuan Shuo, or even old Zhang can do it. Why do you keep staring at me?"This was really too much!Again!"I'm not playing anymore, you guys go play ..."He roared.With that, he ran straight towards the Supreme martial artist. The ninth-rank combatant who was still fighting with the neo martial artists changed his expression and was about to escape.Once the human King escaped ... The situation would return to its previous difficult state.Su Yu, on the other hand, looked at Li Hao again, frowning, and then at Supreme Emperor Tian Fang.Although he had just come out, he knew that this Tian Fang ... Was probably the most difficult to deal with. At this stage, they seemed to be in cahoots, but they were obviously not.He actually had some hidden trump cards, but ... He had to be on guard against this person. In the end, the human King exploded. Now that the human King had escaped, it would be very troublesome. However, once he revealed all his trump cards, this Tian Fang ...
