"The other three regions of the four regions are all dominated by creatures like humans. Humans are the weak ones over there.""Of course, even in the world where the chaos beasts live, there are humans ... But they are often servants and have very low status.""You want to find some opportunities to seize some worlds ... You can seize the worlds where the Beasts of Chaos live. After all, these worlds and the universe of the great path are not theirs. But you have to remember one thing ...""They're different from Red Moon master," sector Lord Sen LAN said solemnly."Red Moon master has left the Dao universe, so his strength has weakened a lot. However, chaos beasts might not be weakened after leaving the Dao universe! This is because they use the Dao of chaos as their main force, and the great Dao universe only has one use for them-purification!""Their DAOs, the power of their great DAOs, are slightly mixed. Although they're strong, they'll be even stronger after being purified by the great Dao world! Not only that, but you can't tell the exact number of high-level venerable sovereigns just by looking at the macro worlds. In the Dragon field, there are some chaos beasts that have reached the seventh level, but they haven't seized the great path universe. Those are the real chaos beasts. These experts will also wander in the chaos there. "Li Hao kept nodding.Forest orchid master explained what she knew, but she didn't know much. She had never been there because it was too dangerous. Humans were the weak there.It could easily be devoured by demon beasts or chaos beasts."Li Hao, you really want to go there?"At this time, venerable the sword said,"the Dragon field hasn't become chaotic yet. There aren't many opportunities to take advantage of it. The neo martial artists are active in the chiyang field ... Even if you don't want to move with us, you can go to the chiyang field. You'll have a better chance."In the Scarlet sun region, new martial artists were the key to everyone's attention. Even if Li Hao was with Silver Moon, a fifth rank venerable sovereign, even if he could kill a sixth rank venerable sovereign, would not be the core. There might be more opportunities there.He was a little regretful about Li Hao's decision.Li Hao smiled."Neo martial arts is in a lot of trouble now. If we go, we may become a burden to neo martial arts. It's better to separate. One to the East and one to the West. We're far away so we won't disturb each other.""Uncle li, the square domain is very big, but it's also very small ... We'll meet again sooner or later!"Sword Saint nodded and said nothing more.On the other hand, monarch Wushan was a little confused.Then ... Where should I go?He had walked out of the clouds and gotten rid of the restrictions because he wanted some freedom. However, in the current chaos, Tian Fang still had some hope. Now that Li Hao and the others were leaving, he was not willing to go to neo martial. If he went there, he would become someone else's vassal sooner or later."Then ... Where should I go?New martial arts was in the chiyang region, Li Hao and the others had gone to the Dragon region, the Crimson Moon region was in a dire state, and Yunxiao was determined to kill him in the tianfang region ...He felt a little melancholic in his heart. Very quickly, he put these things down.Didn't I leave the clouds for freedom?Li Hao and the others didn't restrain themselves and returned the favor. It was good that they had parted ways.Li Hao, on the other hand, glanced at Silver Moon, who had already been swallowed by the Black Panther.  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Black Panther could not be like Emperor Cang, who had swallowed the world without any changes. However, after swallowing the Silver Moon, the Black Panther's body had expanded to a few hundred meters long. In the eyes of the crowd, it was considered a huge monster.In the chaos, a few hundred meters long was not too eye-catching.After looking up at tianfang world again, Li Hao stood up."Seniors, all good things must come to an end! Coming and going, that was chaos! I look forward to our next meeting. Today ... I will set off!""Take care!""Be careful on the road!"The four venerable sovereigns spoke one after another.Sector Lord Sen LAN also reminded him. Very soon, he would return to his own world. Sen LAN had grown to the 7th level. Although it was now hidden, if someone wanted to find her, they might still be able to find her.Even if Li Hao didn't leave this time, he would soon leave.Li Hao didn't say anything more. A few people appeared beside him, Black Panther and Kong Ji.The remaining people returned to the Silvermoon world.At this moment, they were all in the Black Panther's stomach.He walked out of the realm gate and stepped into the chaos. With his back facing Tian Fang, he waved his hand as a farewell.The chaos knew no time.Although they were all very strong, they were still nothing in the chaos. They were not the leaders of a region, not even overlords. The true overlords of the chaos were those eighth rank venerable sovereigns.The neo martial human King could perhaps be considered one.And they ... Were not.In fact, they were all seeking survival.However, this was only the square region. The square region was only a part of the chaotic world, not the entire chaotic world. No one knew how big the chaotic world was. People like sword venerable had only been to the tianfang region and the Hongyue region. Very few experts had left the square region.Even a few level eight venerable sovereigns could only run amuck in the four-sided domain. These people seemed to have never thought of going in any other direction. They all surrounded the four-sided domain and fought for hegemony. It was as if the four chaotic domains were the core of their world.……Li Hao left.There were only four people left in the vast world."Are you two interested in forming an alliance with the new martial arts?" venerable the sword asked.Wu Shan was at the peak of the seventh rank and a free venerable sovereign, so it was easy for him to join neo martial. If forest orchid master wanted to join neo martial, although it was a little troublesome to move the world, it was not too difficult to hide the world and join the ranks of neo martial.

Chapter 3121 Parting (3)
It would be good if he could pull these two over.Although new martial didn't like to make allies, the human King had seen these two before. They had tried to save Wushan and had protected the master of forest orchid, so he had acknowledged them. Li Hao's judgment was obviously good.When the human King saw the two of them, he also had a whole new level of respect.Wu Shan shook his head."No, Li Hao has left. I'll stay here for a few days and then leave!"He looked in the other direction, where Yun Xiao was.After a long time, Wu Shan said softly,"all these years, I've been running around for Yunxiao ... I haven't even been to the entire square domain in the vast chaos. Perhaps ... I'll look around. When tianfang universe opens again, perhaps ... I'll come back."Sector Lord Sen LAN also rejected his good intentions, "I'm going back to Senlan! This time, there are still some venerable sovereigns who want to join my Senlan world. The Senlan world has expanded, but I haven't gone back to take a look. Some of them have died in battle ... I have to go back and deal with them. "Venerable the sword did not force him and nodded his head,""Then let's stay here for ten days! With Li Hao's speed, he'll be out of the tianfang region in ten days. It'll be hard to find him by then. "Moreover, the others might not be willing to waste their time to look for Li Hao.After all, he wasn't a fatal threat in everyone's eyes.The crowd nodded.Venerable the sword glanced at Lizhu and said,""Are you going back?"Li Zhu remained calm and ignored him.He had left neo martial for many years. After neo martial left the chaos, he stayed in neo martial for a few decades before leaving. He had been wandering in the chaos all this time in order to step into tier seven.Today, he had achieved his wish and officially entered Grade 7.Go back?New martial was now facing a crisis. All the targets had been exposed, and almost all the powerhouses had been exposed. Now, the powerhouses of the four regions were all staring at new martial ..."I'm not going back ..." Li Zhu thought for a while and said,"but I'll go to the chiyang region!"Upon hearing this, Sword Saint did not say anything more.Up to you.Although the seventh-rank Li Zhu wouldn't meet up with the new martial artists in the chiyang region, it wouldn't be idle either. This guy's sky-stealing sun-shifting technique was very powerful and was good at hiding his tracks.A hidden rank-7, perhaps ... Would be of greater use.……Since the four level Seven venerable sovereigns were present, and Li Hao had just seized the heaven's side, even some of the observing venerable sovereigns didn't care.All the advanced venerable sovereigns had left!After getting the great path star, who would continue to stay here?Without an advanced venerable sovereign, it would be too difficult to find Li Hao.He left Tian Fang.Looking from afar, Tian Fang was still standing between heaven and earth.Kong Ji was a little reluctant,'it's actually quite comfortable to move with a few rank 7S. You don't have to take on all the trouble ... Of course, it also lacks the spirit to take risks! Brother Hao Yue, if I reach the seventh step ... Will we part ways as well?""Probably," Li Hao gave a perfunctory reply. He took out the map, looked at it, and said,"If we keep moving forward at a fast speed, we'll reach the Dragon field in about eight or nine days. I really envy those bed Masters. In an instant, they can reach anything within the universe ..."Seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns were still very fast.They didn't go through the chaos, but through the cover of the universe to quickly reach another place. Of course, there were some risks. Once the specific location of the universe was spied on, it could be forcibly broken through.Kong Ji didn't bother with him. At this moment, he also looked back.Light ... After I reach the seventh step, I might return. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Father, at the current stage, it might not be a good choice to go against neo martial arts.He had seen and communicated with the neo martial human King, venerable sword, and Lizhu. They were a very strong group of existences. Although light was not weak, he might not be able to gain any advantage in a real confrontation with the neo martial.Without saying anything else, the two men and one dog quickly moved forward in the dark chaos.……Ten days later.The sudden appearance of the four seventh level venerable sovereigns frightened the venerable sovereigns, who were watching them, thinking that something big had happened.However, the four venerable sovereigns soon disappeared from where they were.It disappeared without a trace!No one dared to follow these seventh rank venerable sovereigns, who were all extremely powerful.……After a while.The cloud Master was the first to arrive.Tian Fang was already empty.When the cloud Master stepped into tianfang world with a serious and nervous expression ... The entire tianfang world was so quiet that it seemed to have been destroyed.Not a single person!The Lord of the clouds looked at the empty Tian Fang and was stunned for a long time.He left?He had been talking about how to attack Tian Fang and how to kill the Silvermoon King ... But the other party had killed two tier 7 experts and taken Tian Fang. It seemed like he really just wanted to make Kong Ji go to Nirvana.After Nirvana was over, this group of people left.Not long after, the light Thearch arrived again.,m Looking at the empty tianfang world, the light Thearch was silent for a while. He didn't even look at the cloud Master and left.The Lord of the clouds stared at his back for a while and smiled. He then looked at Tian Fang, shook his head, and disappeared.At this moment, the tianfang universe had yet to recover.The current Tian Fang didn't even have his Taoist connotation. Unless the day the great path universe recovered, it was useless for him to stay here.As these experts continued to investigate, they found that Silvermoon had indeed disappeared.

Chapter 3122 Parting (Part 4)
The four venerable sovereigns went their separate ways.Not long after, someone found venerable the sword's whereabouts. He was heading to the chiyang region, probably to meet up with the new martial arts.In an instant, the chiyang region became the target of everyone's attention.As for Wu Shan and the others, although they were powerful, they were separated from Sword Master and the others. Even if they were seventh level venerable sovereigns, they could not affect the overall situation.Tian Fang was no longer the focus of everyone's attention.Whether or not tianfang had recovered, and when it would recover, those experts who controlled the stars of the great path were the most clear.At this stage ... The key was still to eradicate the great disaster of new martial!……Chiyang region.The turbulence continued.A large number of worlds, like the Crimson Moon region back then, began to migrate.Because neo martial artists had been active recently, these worlds were different from the last time they had moved to the Crimson Moon world. This time, it was the exact opposite. A group of Level Seven great worlds gathered in one place alone, avoiding the Crimson sun World.The last time, it was because they had gathered together that they had been wiped out.This time, the rank seven masters of the Scarlet sun region had their own ideas. The target of the neo-martial artists was the Scarlet Sun World, but they had to be careful of being caught in the grass and beating the rabbit. Therefore, these rank seven masters discussed among themselves and gathered at a place far away from the Scarlet Sun World.Seven to eight Level 7 worlds and dozens of medium-level worlds gathered.The worlds were almost connected from head to tail, and they were extremely close to each other.This was also a lesson learned from the red moon region.At that time, the world of the red moon zone had been a bit far away, and at the crucial moment, he had simply been unable to make it in time.At this time, the Crimson sun World was a bare world standing alone in the center of the Crimson sun region. There were other worlds nearby, but without a powerful world, some small worlds couldn't escape, nor did they have the ability to escape. They could only stay where they were and hope that the new martial world wouldn't look at them.The Crimson sun World.Yang Qi filled the air.The master of Scarlet sun was like the sun, radiating light. At this moment, he was not as calm as he appeared to be. He was also complaining in his heart. A level eight world was very powerful, but a neo martial artist was not weak.There were many venerable sovereigns in neo martial arts, and there were many Level Seven venerable sovereigns.If the human king and emperor Cang joined forces, they could easily rival an eighth level venerable sovereign. The venerable sovereigns of the neo martial world were not afraid of death. If they were to fight in a full-scale battle, the Crimson sun World might not be able to win.Of course, if his opponent attacked with full force and had the home advantage, he wouldn't be afraid. However, at this moment ... Bad news came.At this moment, venerable sovereign Chi Yang spoke."The Silver Moon King has left Tian Fang early. I don't care where he went. What I'm more concerned about is that the sword Saint and the catacombs King are returning!"With two more seventh level venerable sovereigns at once, neo martial's strength would increase greatly again!"In addition, Wu Shan and Sen LAN might not have left. Maybe ... They'll follow us. If that's the case, four more seventh-rank powerhouses will be a huge threat to us!"The group of venerable sovereigns below were frowning.Who would have thought that neo martial, who had been suppressed by Crimson Moon before, would turn the tables so quickly in such a short time? even Crimson moon's old nest was destroyed."My Lord, neo martial wants to swallow Chi Yang and enter level eight ... Once they reach level eight, they'll be a threat to the entire four-square region ... Have the three venerable sovereigns, Yunxiao, Red Moon, and Dragon Master not made any moves?" Venerable sovereign Chi Yang frowned slightly."Yunxiao is willing to come to help, but ... His idea is that it's best to get rid of the great threat, light, first. Otherwise, if he comes easily, once light sovereign besieges his nest and attacks Yunxiao ... That will be a big problem."He could understand this point.As for Hong Yue, she went to the Dragon field in person to persuade the Dragon Master to come and fight with them. This was good news. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, the bad news was that ... The Dragon Lord might not come.This was because, at present, it was still a war between humans.New martial didn't enter the Dragon field, which was the safest place in the square field. The Dragon Master even had the idea of sitting on the mountain and watching the Tigers fight. He might refuse the Alliance and wait for them to kill each other until both sides were injured before the other party joined the war.At that moment, a seventh rank venerable sovereign spoke,""Then ... Why don't we change our direction and ask for help?"Change direction?The chiyang region was located in the West, the westernmost region of the Sifang region. Hong Yue and the others didn't even count on it. If they changed their direction ... They would be even further west.Scarlet Sun Master frowned slightly at this.After a long time, he slowly said,"you mean ... Further west?""Right!"The seventh level venerable sovereign also knew what Chi Yang was thinking about. He said in a deep voice,""Daoist master, neo martial arts has become a big problem!"Venerable sovereign Chi Yang was silent for a while before he said,""I know. However ... There were a large number of chaos pillars near the square domain! That place had formed a unique Primal Chaos region, and it was filled with Primal Chaos tribulation lightning! Moreover, it's extremely easy to get lost and get trapped inside, or even be annihilated by the primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... Even if we can get out, some of the experts in the square domain might not be willing to come in and help us ...""Tian Fang!"The rank seven venerable sovereign said in a deep voice,"although we don't have much contact with the experts outside the four-direction region, some people were able to leave the four-direction region by chance in the early years. There are also people from the outside who enter ... A rank nine world is the top existence even outside the four-direction region. After all, few venerable sovereigns from the outside world have heard of a rank nine world!"

Chapter 3123 Parting (Part 5)
"As long as we tell them that Tian Fang is about to recover ... A rank seven venerable sovereign might still hesitate, but a rank eight venerable sovereign would be the exact opposite. They would definitely hope to get a piece of the pie and enter rank nine!"A tier 9 was a true Overlord.Outside the four-sided domain, there were still some people who could survive the lightning tribulation and enter or leave the four-sided domain, even though the chaos pillars were dangerous.However, in the past, the level eight venerable sovereigns of the four regions had always been fighting internally, but they had always been United against outsiders.Tian Fang belongs to the four-sided domain.Even if it was resuscitated, it had nothing to do with outsiders. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Although the experts from the outside world had their own ideas, it was very troublesome to pass the lightning tribulation. They couldn't launch a large-scale attack and had to take the risk alone. Once they were surrounded by the experts from the four-sided domain, even a few more level eight experts would be killed.Thus, after so many years, although the two sides had some contact, the true top powerhouses rarely entered the four-square region.Similarly, the top experts of the four-sided domain rarely went out. If they went out, they wouldn't be able to leave the world. If they went out alone, they might be torn apart by the experts outside!"Why did you think of asking for help from the outside world?" venerable sovereign Chi Yang looked at the person who spoke."A few days ago, a venerable sovereign from the outside world came to the chaos pillar," the venerable sovereign said in a deep voice."I happened to be nearby and got in touch with him ... It's said that a new level nine venerable sovereign might have been born in a more distant area outside! Now, it also seems to be conquering all sides, wanting to unify the chaos!""That person doesn't know much about the details, but it's said that many Level 7 and level 8 powerhouses have gathered outside the four-sided domain. Some people even mentioned tianfang world!""Even if we don't take the initiative to look for them, they might come in ... In that case, I think that while the others are not too concerned, I, Chi Yang, can go ahead and reach some consensus with the powerhouses outside!"To take the initiative!After all, the red sun sect was one of the top forces in the four regions.The master of crimson sun frowned slightly.""A rank nine venerable sovereign has been born in the outside world? However, even a level-nine expert would be dreaming if he wanted to unify the chaosverse! Back then, the Lord of Tian Fang was extremely powerful, but he couldn't unify the chaos ... A newly born tier 9 dares to be so arrogant?"He didn't understand, but he didn't say anything. He just frowned."Tianfang world is the four-sided domain's greatest wealth. Moreover, it seems like it will recover soon!"Now, he wasn't too willing to bring in the powerhouses from the outside.The venerable sovereign who spoke continued,"path master, now that new martial arts is staring at us, Red Moon, cloud sky, light, and Dragon Master, these eighth-rank venerable sovereigns, have not come to help. Perhaps ... They also hope that new martial arts and we will both suffer!" "We're being pestered by the neo martial artists. Even if Tian Fangzhen is resurrected, it'll be difficult for us to have the opportunity to go to Tian Fang to seize the opportunity!""Since that's the case, why don't we muddy the water!""After all, we're a local force. Besides, the venerable sovereigns from outside can't be brought to the world, so their strength will be weakened. If they form an alliance with us, they'll have some local advantages. It'll be beneficial for everyone if we work together!" Scarlet Sun Master fell into deep thought.Cooperating with the outside forces was like asking a Tiger for its skin. Of course, the other party's main target was tianfang world."Recently ... Has the primal Chaos lightning territory been doing well at the primal Chaos pillar?" he asked.He asked.The venerable sovereign who had just spoken nodded."We've entered a rare period of peace. Although it's still a little troublesome, we can barely pass through. It's a little dangerous, but not too dangerous.""I don't really care."Thearch Chi Yang rubbed his temples."The new martial almost ruined everything. If they entered a peaceful period, even if I don't go to them, there might be powerhouses who will enter the four-sided domain! It's not too late for you to know now. ""I can't leave now," he said after some thought."It's best for the seventh level venerable sovereigns to stay and protect chiyang together ... Is there anyone willing to make a trip to the chaotic lightning territory and interact with the experts outside?"The group of venerable sovereigns in the hall looked at each other in fear.​ The primal Chaos lightning domain had lightning tribulation.And it was a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!Li Hao's tribulation was like a meal to him, but to them, the chaos lightning tribulation was extremely dangerous. Although it was different from tribulation transcendence, the lightning tribulation around the pillar of chaos would not leave you alone.However, it was also very dangerous to cross the lightning territory.If he was not careful, he would be in danger of dying.Thearch Chi Yang frowned slightly."Whoever is willing to go can enjoy the power of 300 million great Dao crystals alone. If Chi Yang can Annex the new martial arts, there will definitely be more grade seven experts. They will also be given priority!"Although it was just a fantasy, now that they were fighting to the death with the neo martial artists, once they could really Annex it ... Seventh-grade was what everyone yearned for.At this moment, a bold venerable sovereign took the initiative to say,""My Lord, I'm willing to go!""However, I'm only at the sixth level," he continued."I may not be able to speak to those seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns. They may not believe me. I can represent Chi Yang!"Venerable red sun nodded and smiled."Simple. I'll give you the power of the daosource of chiyang! If we can convince one or two level eight venerable sovereigns to come, that will be enough!"

Chapter 3124 Parting (Part 6)
Too much would not be good.If it was too much, the other party would turn from guest to host.The rank six venerable sovereign was overjoyed.The land of Dao origin was the pure power of the Crimson sun. It was beneficial for both comprehending and absorbing it.As for the risk ... Staying was also a risk.It might be even more dangerous!Neo martial obviously wouldn't give up until they took down Chi Yang. It was the same whether they fought with neo martial or went to find help."Right," venerable sovereign Chi Yang added,"keep this operation a secret and be careful. Don't let anyone find out!" Hongyue and the others might not care about what's happening outside the square region right now. They're all eyeing us covetously and have a lot of ideas ... If we can secretly attract a few strong people to help us, and if these guys want to attack chiyang ... Then we'll catch them all in one fell swoop!""Yes, sir!"The rank six venerable sovereign didn't dare to say anything, and Scarlet Sun Master quickly gave him some daosource power.The pure power of the Scarlet sun could not only help the other party become stronger, but it could also help them overcome the primal Chaos lightning tribulation and leave the four-sided domain.Soon, the venerable sovereign left.As for the master of crimson sun, he looked at the direction in which the other party had left. After some consideration, he said,""There are very few peaceful periods in the lightning territory near the chaos pillar. Coincidentally, when tianfang was about to recover, the lightning territory became peaceful. It seems to be encouraging experts from the outside world to enter tianfang ..."He had thought a little more. Was this a coincidence?Or was it not a coincidence?A rank nine world had recovered, and the usually dangerous lightning territory had become much quieter. Was he hoping that everyone would come and snatch it together?Also, the outside world had actually given birth to a level nine venerable sovereign ... Were there any other level nine venerable sovereigns in the chaos?The Scarlet Sun Master didn't know. He wasn't sure, but he knew that there were no level nine venerable sovereigns in the surrounding areas outside the four-sided zone.If he did, he would have come to the tianfang region long ago.The grade-9 cultivators outside were unifying the chaos and conquering the world.The four-sided domain was also in chaos.In the past, although the chaos was chaotic, it was not as troublesome as it was now. Scarlet Sun Master was having a headache. Perhaps ... He still had to think of a way to devour Tian Fang and reach level nine. Only by reaching level nine would he have the capital to truly dominate the chaos."The turmoil is about to happen ... Once it happens, it will be an opportunity for everyone. The chaos has been quiet for many years. Now, all the turmoil might be indicating that the battle between the type 9 powerhouses is about to happen."……The powerhouses 'gazes had already shifted from the four-sided domain to the outside. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  All of this was still too far away for Li Hao.He hadn't even explored the four regions, so he naturally wouldn't think about things outside of the four regions. In the Crimson Moon world, he had found a map, which included some of the major worlds outside the four regions.However, a special chaotic dangerous land seemed to be formed around the square zone. It was marked as the lightning zone on the map, so Li Hao didn't look at it in detail.In any case, he wasn't prepared to leave the four-sided domain yet.At this moment, Li Hao had already entered the Dragon field. The most obvious distinction between the Dragon field and the tianfang field was the difference in their auras.As the tianfang region was dominated by humans, the chaotic Qi dynamic was actually much more peaceful.In the Dragon field, there were many chaos beasts and demons. The power of the chaos great Dao was much more violent and explosive. Ordinary venerable sovereigns would not be able to adapt to it. The power of the great Dao was too restless.Not only that, in the Dragon field, giant Beasts of Chaos that roamed the void were common. They were much more unscrupulous here.At this moment, the Black Panther was no longer in its dog form.Instead, it had returned to its original appearance, which was also the appearance of the Chaos Beast that he had taken over. It was a bull, a chaos bull.Li Hao and Kong Ji, on the other hand, observed the entire Dragon field from one of the Black Panther's ears using daylight thief.A Black Panther that was a few hundred meters long was not eye-catching at all in this place.He was a rank five venerable sovereign after all!Just a moment ago, a 3rd level Chaos Beast was flying in the air. It was a few thousand meters long, and that was after being compressed. Compared to it, the Black Panther was much smaller."Black Panther, let's go to a Chaos Beast World and see if we can communicate!"The Black Panther didn't say much. It looked around and started to wander in a certain direction.There were many chaos beasts here.To Black Panther, this place was actually quite comfortable.Li Hao, on the other hand, closed his eyes and sensed the chaos great Dao in this area. The chaos great Dao was chaotic everywhere, but it was even more chaotic here!However, after some careful observation, Li Hao also made some small discoveries and gains.Although the Dao of chaos here was chaotic, the power of great DAOs seemed to be more vigorous.Perhaps there were too many chaos beasts, causing the chaos Dao here to be thicker and more violent than other places. Of course, in the void, other than these chaos great DAOs, one could also vaguely detect some relatively peaceful great Dao power.This could be the power of the great Dao of the demon race.Moreover, in the Dragon field, none of the worlds kept a low profile. In the distance, some of the worlds were full of energy. There were even huge Beasts of Chaos that were directly entrenched in the chaos.Unlike the other three forces, even a level 8 great world wouldn't be so ostentatious, except for its grandeur.The Dragon field had gained more territorial awareness.In the distance, there seemed to be a Dragon circling the entire world. That was probably the dragon world. It was said that there were many Grade 7s there.Not only were they born in the world, but chaos beasts could also step into the seventh-tier without the need for a great Dao universe. Therefore, it was said that the Dragon Master had also subdued some seventh-tier chaos beasts, but no one knew if it was true.In any case, Dragon World was likely to be the most powerful of all the tier 8 worlds.In the human race, there were very few who did not need a great Dao universe to reach Level Seven on their own. High-level itinerant cultivators were rare. On the other hand, the chaos beasts here were all itinerant cultivators.Li Hao was looking forward to it.He was looking forward to meeting some powerful chaos beasts, preferably seventh-rank ones, so that he could observe them carefully. How did these guys reach the seventh-rank?A rank seven Dao domain would have at least a thousand great DAOs surrounding it. Even an existence like sword venerable would find it difficult to reach rank seven.Could it be that even a high-ranked chaotic beast was more talented than the sword Master?Li Hao didn't believe this.That meant that ... The chaos beasts had their own unique way of advancing. Perhaps, they did not need to be entangled by thousands of great DAOs to form a special Dao domain. If that was the case, it would be of great reference value to him.At this moment, Li Hao was full of anticipation for the Dragon field, and he wasn't nervous at all.

Chapter 3125 Waves In The Heart (1)
In the Dragon field.Dragon World.There were many giant Dragons here. Although the Dragon race was a giant Beast of Chaos, ever since the Dragon Lord took over the dragon world and settled down here, it was originally very difficult for the giant Beasts of Chaos to give birth to offspring. The Dragon Lord used the power of a mighty figure to do some tricks, allowing the Dragon race, which had always had few descendants, to reproduce and live in this Dragon World.Not only that, but the current Dragon Lord was also a person with great perseverance. The original Dao of the Dragon race was also the Dao of chaos, but today, there were 10000 Dao.The Dragon race could cultivate any great Dao.At this moment, the Dragon Tribe had officially begun to transform into the local demon tribe. They were no longer pure chaos beasts. Only a few high-level members of the Dragon Tribe still maintained their identity as chaos beasts.Chaos beasts had both advantages and disadvantages. They could devour worlds and cultivate chaos, but it was difficult for them to give birth to descendants. The cultivation of the Dao of chaos, coupled with the fact that it was difficult for experts to give birth to descendants, could only give birth to one descendant in millions of years. The number of chaos beasts was decreasing.And now, the dragon clan alone in the dragon world had a population of a million!To a tier 8 world, a million was an extremely rare number, but to the chaos race ... If a race could give birth to a million chaos beasts, would they still be considered chaos beasts?It was simply unbelievable!At this moment, the red moon Emperor was walking in the dragon world and nodded slightly. Beside him was a seventh-rank Dragon. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Red Moon sovereign looked at the Dragon whelps and smiled with pride."Lord Dragon Lord's Dao is unparalleled. Our dragon race was originally extremely rare in the chaos. It is said that the rarer it is, the stronger it is ... But now, our dragon race is firmly the number one race of the chaos behemoths. Not only is the Dragon Lord the strongest expert of the chaos race, but our dragon race is also the most numerous in number ..."Red Moon sovereign smiled and nodded slightly. He looked at the world of the dragon clan and then at the creatures in all directions. He raised his eyebrows and said,""The Dragon Lord is indeed skilled! I see that each Dragon has enslaved many humans ... In that case, they used some grafting technique?"The grade 7 giant dragon also smiled,"you have good eyes!"He didn't say anything more.The red moon sovereign was a human after all ... Of course, the primal Chaos did not care much about this. The red moon sovereign was only the leader of the human race in the red moon world. In a different world, who cared what race you were?However, the Dragon race had indeed enslaved a large number of humans.Many, many times!Almost all worlds would give birth to humans. Furthermore, humans reproduced very quickly. It was simply unbelievable. There were so many of them that they were uncountable. Of course, there were too few talented humans. As for the Dragon race, they were all very talented.At this moment, Red Moon sovereign looked around and pondered.Interesting! This was also his first time in the dragon world. The interesting thing about the dragon world was that these giant Dragons would turn themselves into myths, totems, and gather faith. They would then split humans into different races, and each group would cultivate the same technique.With that, it was as if all the humans were providing a Dragon with the source of the great Dao and the laws of the great Dao.These humans would eventually become food for the Dragon Tribe.The technique of faith was a common technique in the chaos, but ... Red Moon sovereign looked around again. He was an eighth rank venerable sovereign, so he could see many things with just a glance.At this moment, he frowned slightly,'the smell of blood is a little heavy ... It's fine for the Dragon race to raise humans. After all, this is the dragon world! But ... I don't mind killing too many people, but if some other sovereigns see me, they'll definitely start a fight. "The type 7 Dragon did not seem to care,"dispute?" Who would dare?""Light!""That guy has always been sanctimonious and self-proclaimed to be bright and Holy!" Venerable Red Moon sovereign chuckled.Hearing him mention the light Thearch, the rank seven Dragon Warrior calmed down a little and explained,""It's not a frequent massacre. It's just that recently, some Dragon disciples have been cultivating the art of killing and the art of blood and Qi ... They need a large amount of killing. Actually, our Dragon World needs a large number of humans. After all, there are millions of Dragons who need to gather the power of the great Dao. Usually, there are few massacres."He didn't explain it to Hong Yue, but he thought that if this news got out, it might arouse the dislike of some so-called human leaders, so he added this. It wasn't like he was going to kill them every day. He just needed them for a few days.And the other party obviously didn't take it seriously.p He was just killing a few people.The chaos lacked everything except for humans. A small world could easily have a population of ten billion people. A large world could easily have trillions of people. There were so many that even if countless worlds were destroyed and trillions of humans died, not many people would care.Because there were really too many.Even the so-called leaders of the human race wouldn't say much. They would only criticize them a little. Would they really start a war with a major force like the dragon world for someone who had nothing to do with them?They didn't belong to the same world, so who cared?No one would say anything if they didn't pillage the humans of the great world or only a small number of them.Red Moon sovereign nodded and chuckled,""It's better to be careful ... Of course, no one comes here usually. People like Guangming may look sanctimonious, but they have destroyed countless worlds in private. However, they are the leaders of the human race. In fact, they are only doing it for their own interests. It's ridiculous.""The radiance holy man doesn't have a good reputation in the realms. He's not qualified to be the leader of the human race!" The Dragon laughed.

Chapter 3126 Waves In The Heart (2)
Hong Yue also laughed.Of course, there were also some people who added fuel to the fire. After all, the power of light indeed looked Holy. Moreover, the light Supreme Emperor was an eighth rank Supreme Emperor. This would improve his reputation and help him to stabilize his position as the so-called leader of the human race ... That would be a big problem.Hong Yue, Yun Xiao, and Guang Ming were all level eight venerable sovereigns. In fact, they were not good people in some of the human race's stories in the major worlds.Some of them were done by the venerable sovereigns of this world, while some were spread from the outside world.Anyway, the human race didn't have a true leader. They just minded their own business. People like light didn't want to waste their time. It was too troublesome and complicated.This was not just One World, but countless worlds. Unless one really had the intention to unify the chaos ... It was not worth the effort.As for the power of faith, it was useful.However ... It was also extremely difficult to make people believe in you.Red Moon master seemed to have thought of something. She smiled and said,""Oh, right. When I came here, I encountered a small world at the edge of the Dragon field. It was quite interesting. Two human cultivators seemed to be spreading the way of faith and believing in the gods ... In that small world, they killed demons and chaos. By killing demons and chaos, they gained the faith of some enslaved humans ..."As soon as he said that, the Dragon quickly stopped.""Faith? Release the human race? Dao master, can you point out the exact location and ... How strong are you?""Two half-step sovereigns,""Oh ..."This time, the Dragon instantly lost interest. Half-step Emperor?What a joke!This was the Dragon field. There were countless venerable sovereigns of the chaos race, the monster race, and a large number of high-level venerable sovereigns here. Where did these two idiots come from? they were only half-step sovereigns, yet they were here to free the human race?Alright, I have to say, this is indeed a good place.The humans here were enslaved by countless demons and Beasts of Chaos. They were the easiest to subdue, to have faith in others and to forge the power of faith for them. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The location chosen was not bad, but this strength ... Was not worth mentioning.He was too weak!It was impossible to cause any waves. If it was a high-level venerable sovereign, this Dragon would be a little worried, but a half-step sovereign ... With the word "sovereign" in it, it was nothing.The Dragon Realm was an eighth-rank world. The seventh-rank venerable sovereign had thought that someone had broken into the dragon Realm world. Now that he heard this ... He couldn't be bothered to care anymore. It was a small matter. Even small worlds had venerable sovereigns guarding them. They could easily defeat the other party. Even if it was broken, there would be other venerable sovereigns nearby.Those who were not venerable sovereigns ... Didn't even bother to take a second look.Red Moon sovereign did not think much of it. He was just there to watch the show. When he passed by, he took a look. Many people had cultivated the power of faith, but they dared to kill Beasts of Chaos and demons in the Dragon field to win the faith of humans ... He had to say that they were bold!Some people had thought of such a Grand idea.In the past, some advanced venerable sovereigns had even thought about it.There were countless worlds in the Dragon Realm, and most of them were dominated by the chaos race and the demon race. Some demons were still okay, as they were born in their own land. Although the status of humans was low, they could still live normally.Some demons treated humans as food. Their status was even lower than the demons in the human world.He would eat when he was hungry, and he would eat when he wanted to ...The humans here were the easiest to satisfy. As long as someone was willing to save them and give them some status and power, they would easily believe in you. This was not just one or two people. If there were more than 10 billion humans in a world...It was unbelievable!Proving the way here with faith and saving trillions of humans, even if only one-tenth of the humans believed in you, the power of faith provided might be enough to make you a top-tier venerable sovereign!Hundreds of thousands of years ago, there was a level Seven venerable sovereign who wanted to give it a try ... The result was self-evident. He caused too much of a commotion and his appetite was too big. In the end, he was killed by the Dragon Lord, his soul scattered, not even leaving a single hair behind.The Beasts of Chaos in the Dragon field were more United than the human venerable sovereigns. The local demons were also more United. This was why the Beasts of Chaos were so few in number but still dominated a region. Seeing that the type 7 Dragon didn't seem to mind, he chuckled,""That old man, light, did mention that he wanted us, Red Moon, and cloud sky to attack the Dragon field together and save the humans here. The power of light is the best at spreading and is the easiest to gain people's faith. If he succeeds, this guy has the hope of becoming the second level nine venerable sovereign in the four-square field ..."At that moment, he was madly insulting the light Thearch!He had to get the light Thearch involved in everything.That Grade 7 dragon race didn't say much.At this moment, a Dragon's Roar resounded through the world. In an instant, a person appeared. He wasn't in the form of a Dragon, but a human. He appeared in front of Hong Yue with an imposing appearance and incomparably mighty power."Hongyue, do you want to die in the light that much?" he said with a deep voice.Red Moon sovereign laughed,"Dragon Master, I'm telling the truth!" The power of light was indeed good at spreading. To those ordinary people, they could not see through the essence of Dao and could only see the shallowest side in front of them. They thought that bright, white, and Holy-looking things were good! However, was the power of light any different from the other great DAOs? It's just a bright appearance, but in private ... Who's better than who? Radiant old man, if you really want to spread your religion ... The Dragon field will be the most important place!""That's only if he has the ability!"

Chapter 3127 Waves In The Heart (3)
The Dragon Lord placed his hands behind his back and chuckled.""There aren't many experts in the Dragon field. There's only one level eight and dozens of Level Seven. With a single order from me, they're all willing to fight. The chaos race has wandered the chaos for too long and finally found a place to stay ... What, you humans don't like it?""Hahaha, I didn't say that. I don't mind ...""I'm all alone now. I don't even have my own world. Why would I care about this?"venerable Red Moon smiled. I'm talking about light. "The Dragon Master also laughed."Don't mention neo martial. Keep mentioning light ... Don't tell me you plan to kill light first?""Why can't I?"Red Moon sovereign chuckled."If we don't kill him, this guy has been causing trouble and making people afraid. If we fight with neo martial with all our might, that guy will strike us from behind. That will be a big problem!" If you want to destroy new martial ... Then it's best to destroy the light first! "Then, go all out and annihilate the neo martial artists!""Neo martial human King, Dragon Master. Don't you have any thoughts about his title?"The Dragon Master sneered."That's a new martial human King, not a chaos human King! What, you still want to use this to convince me to fight with neo martial?"So what if he was a human King?Human Kings would only say that they were neo martial human Kings. Could it be that all the humans in the chaos were the descendants of human Kings?Fang ping would not have said that!It wasn't that he didn't dare to, but that he had never thought of saving a group of irrelevant people. They didn't know each other, weren't familiar with each other, and didn't even belong to the same world. Although they had two eyes, two ears, and a mouth ... What could they do?Hong Yue wanted to use this to convince herself to fight to the death with neo martial arts, but she was thinking too much.Red Moon sovereign could not convince this man, so he said,"Neo martial arts is a big problem ...""As long as we don't leave the Dragon field, we have dozens of advanced venerable sovereigns ... We're much more reliable than your so-called Red Moon Alliance. No matter how strong his neo martial artist is, can he break into our Dragon field?"The Dragon Master was indifferent."It's enough for the Dragon Realm to occupy one area. If you don't want to unify the chaos, there's no way you can do it. The ambition of the human race is much stronger than that of the chaos race! That's why all of you feel a life-threatening danger ... While we don't pose much of a threat. As for the Yang Qi, he had his eyes on the Crimson sun World. After he took down the Crimson sun World, would he still care about a rank seven world? The Vajra realm is also filled with the purest of yang energy. However, if we really take down chiyang, the human Emperor will probably value the light and won't come to my side!""What about Tian Fang?" Red Moon Thearch raised her eyebrows. Today, the Dragon Lord isn't willing to work together. The next day, when tianfang world opens ... Don't blame everyone for not giving the chaos Race Face!"If the soft approach didn't work, he would use the hard approach. If you insist on sitting on the mountain and watching the Tigers fight, then once tianfang world opens, the human race's venerable sovereigns will all target you. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Dragon Lord chuckled but did not comment."When you fight the neo martial artists to the death, a group of venerable sovereigns will die. Now, many level Sevens have died, and you, Hong Yue, have become a stray dog. If a few level eights die ... When the time comes, the Dragon field will join forces. Will we really be afraid of you?Red Moon wanted me to help, but she was too naive.Moreover, once he made a move and controlled the world to fight, neo martial would inevitably make him their first target. The Dragon Master was not stupid. With neo martial's character, if he made a move, he would be a great threat to them.At that time, if he didn't kill him first, would neo martial arts give up?"You, Red Moon sovereign, are free. You're just an itinerant cultivator. At worst, you can just run away. If you really can't survive in the four-sided zone, you can go to the outside world and undergo the chaos lightning tribulation. It's not difficult for you.But we have a big family and business, are we just going to run away like this?Red Moon sovereign was not annoyed when he saw that he was not affected by either soft or hard tactics. He continued,"If we don't solve the problem in the four-sided domain, it'll be a mess. Someone might collude with the venerable sovereigns from the outside world!"Red Moon sovereign smiled faintly."We're old acquaintances in the square region. If we can solve the problem ourselves, we'd better do it ourselves. If we force some of them to come and attract a large number of venerable sovereigns from the outside world ... By then, some of them might not want to see the Dragon Tribe enslaving trillions of human beings! In the outside world, the human race is the only dominant force. The square region is still fine, and everyone is in charge of one area, but the outside world ... If they come, they can just try to break the balance in the Dragon field. If they can 't, they can just run away. After all, the family business is not here!"The experts in the square domain all had their own businesses here. No one would risk going against the Dragon field. If they failed, all their properties would be confiscated!However, if those from the outside world were to see the countless humans enslaved here, they could just run away if they wanted to cause some trouble ... No matter how strong the Dragon Lord was, if they were to kill their way out, would they be able to raid the other party's lair?The Dragon Master frowned slightly and glanced at him. After a long while, he said in a low voice,""The" others "you're talking about are you!""Your Crimson Moon world is gone. It seems that you have nothing to worry about. Crimson Moon, are you thinking about this?"The killing intent began to rise! This guy didn't even have a home. If he really wanted to cause trouble in the Dragon field, it would be a little troublesome if he ran away.Red Moon master laughed. I actually think that being a rogue cultivator is quite good, having nothing to worry about. Previously, because I was dragged down by the world, I was repeatedly targeted, but now, I'm free ... But I don't have the mood to do that. I'm talking about Chi Yang and Yun Xiao. Chi Yang is now in danger everywhere, but no one has helped him for a long time. Do you think that if he's forced into a corner, he'll be like me and let the world be destroyed?"

Chapter 3128 Waves In The Heart (3)
The Dragon Lord raised his brows. That was true.It wouldn't be good if they attracted outsiders.In this place, everyone knew where their base was. If an outsider came, the Dragon field would be in trouble. Besides, the chaos race, including the demon race, were treasures in many people's eyes.At this moment, Hong Yue's words moved him.As she was thinking, Hong Yue continued,"also, if Chi Yang is really taken down by the new martial arts, and the new martial arts world becomes an eighth-rank world, the human king and emperor Cang will both advance to the eighth-rank at the same time ... The two eighth-rank experts can join forces and borrow each other's strength. They can even ... Unify the four-square region. At that time, can the Dragon region really resist them?""As for the Dragon Master's so-called 'don't provoke them'... Does neo martial care if you provoke them or not?"He chuckled."The human King is extremely domineering. Your Dragon Lord slaughtered and enslaved the human race. It's fine if he didn't see it. If he really saw it ... Do you think that he, who calls himself the king of the human race, will let you go?"The Dragon Lord looked at him coldly.Red Moon sovereign laughed again."Of course, I'm just reminding you. However, neo martial artists are too young. Young people are full of vigor!" We're used to it, but they haven't ... Seeing countless humans die and become food, hehe, do you think the human King will care about them or not?"Do you care?It was hard to say for others, but with the arrogant character of the human King and the eldest brother of chaos, he did not know the situation here. If he knew, how could he not care?If I kill someone, I'm the one who kills!However, demons were not allowed to kill or enslave humans. The human King had a strong sense of immersion. This could be seen from the human King's personality. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  The Dragon Lord glanced at him and sneered,""Hongyue, it seems that the world is gone. You're even better at talking now. Without any fear, you're even more daring."Red Moon master smiled but did not say anything.At this point, other than wanting revenge, what else could he think of?You guys have scruples and you guys can consider, but I won 't.Even the great Dao universe was gone!Of course, new martial arts had to be destroyed, but the key figure, the Silver Moon King, had to die!He died without a burial place!The new martial was the main culprit, and the Silver Moon King was also the key. The other party had actually broken through his own world and entered the great Dao universe, tearing apart his Dao of desire. It was simply hateful ... And also terrifying.My daosource has been torn apart.Such a situation was almost impossible to happen.When he thought of the Silver Moon King, he suddenly said,"Oh right, there's one more thing. It's said that Silver Moon has retreated from tianfang. If he were to meet up with neo martial, he should have left with venerable the sword and the others. But now, that's not the case!" If he were still in the tianfang region ... It would be good to join with Guangming, but the Crimson Moon region ... Is now extremely desolate. Do you think that guy has come to the Dragon region?""Oh!"The Dragon Lord did not care at all.What's wrong?It was fine as long as neo martial didn't come!A fifth rank venerable sovereign, even if he was strong enough to fight a seventh rank venerable sovereign ... What would happen after that?Red Moon wouldn't want him to be afraid of this Silver Moon King, right?This was a little ridiculous! "Don't underestimate the Silver Moon King!""He's not simple," Hong Yue said indifferently."How can a battle between a fifth-rank and seventh-rank be simple?" How long did it take for the human King to rise? How long do you think he'll take?""Oh, I know."The Dragon Lord gave a perfunctory reply as usual.So what?Red Moon master did not say anything more, and he was too lazy to say anything. It was very likely that Silver Moon was here, but the Dragon field was too big, and it was not his territory ... He could not be bothered to care or investigate. If he really did, the Dragon Master would fall out with him!It would be best if the Dragon Lord suffered some losses. That way, he would take the initiative to deal with Silver Moon.That hateful Silver Moon!Red Moon master also knew that things had to be discussed slowly, so he was not in a hurry. At this moment, he could not wait for the others to suffer a loss. He had suffered a big loss, and now he was not happy with anyone!……Just as Red Moon master and Dragon Master were chatting ...At the edge of the Dragon field.In a small world.A man and a woman were currently building their own country. It hadn't been long, but these two had both been Kings before and were familiar with all the tricks.Furthermore, they discovered that the humans here were too easy to hoodwink!Just by giving them some benefits, they all treated them as true gods!She was so grateful that she shed tears. That feeling ... Was unprecedented. Even the Queen found it unbelievable. The people here were too gullible ... No, too easy to tame. This was even easier than the divine Kingdom.More importantly, it was true faith!In just a few months, she had gathered hundreds of millions of believers. She even felt that they were more devout than the faith of the divine Kingdom. It was somewhat unbelievable!One had to know that in the divine Kingdom, it had been managed for generations before faith was formed.But here ... The humans here would shed tears of gratitude when they killed a demon. They would go crazy and have extreme faith. They would knock their heads against the ground and pledge their loyalty to the demon with a casual cultivation technique ...p This was simply a Holy Land for the path of faith!He couldn't believe it!Was there no one in the primordial chaos who trained in the Dao of faith?If she could take down this small world, she felt that she and the Dali King could directly rely on their faith to become emperors. If they could take down a few more worlds, it would be easy for them to reach level two and level three!If he could continue to sweep away his opponents ... What would Li Hao be?What level was Li Hao at now?Perhaps, she and the king of Dali would soon be able to enter the intermediate level, or even ... The advanced level!It was unbelievable!At this moment, the king of Dali was feeling a little guilty. After arranging some things, he felt a little headache. He looked at the Queen and saw that she was happy. "I'm a little scared!"

Chapter 3129 Waves In The Heart (3)
"Why?"The Dali King sighed,"it's too simple, too crazy!" "I feel like ... I'm about to vindicate my Dao. The emperor's Dao! In Dali, I've been working hard, and the people of Dali don't even believe in me or admire me this much ... My God, even when I'm here, people will treat my fart as a God's fart ... Aren't you afraid?""What are you afraid of?"The Queen's eyes flickered,'the bold will die from overeating while the timid will starve to death! I know that there must be a problem, and it might even be related to that so-called Dragon Lord. But if we stay in Tian Fang, we'll only be able to become venerable sovereigns at most. But here ... Have you noticed? It's easy for us to become emperors now! "Moreover, our faith is still growing crazily. I feel that we can even easily reach the 4th rank, or even ... Stronger! If we don't interfere with each other, you can walk your path of all people, and I'll walk my path of divinity, then we might both be able to surpass Li Hao ..."In Silver Moon, he had been suppressed by Li Hao!Now that he was out, he finally felt that the sky was high and the birds could fly freely. As for danger ... What was it?Even if the venerable sovereign was searching for them in this small world, she was not afraid. At most, she would just fight with him!He was stronger than Li Hao!Li Hao only knew how to scheme. Look at how good the demons were. They openly called you out for a fight, and you didn't have to worry about being schemed against or whether anything you did was a trap!It felt too good!There was danger everywhere, but she was willing to bear such danger.The king of Dali was still worried."I'm still a little worried. It's not that I'm afraid of danger, but I'm thinking, such a good treasure land, are we the only ones who have found it?"“……”The Queen didn't say a word. Someone else had probably discovered it, and most likely ... They were all dead.Who cares!,m She wasn't stupid. Of course, she would consider this, but ... She still felt that it was worth it.Not long after she and the king of Dali were released from the Silver Moon Kingdom, they had escaped from Tian Fang. It was also a risk to take a ride from a venerable sovereign and give up all their belongings before they were taken away.Of course, it was also confidence. She was confident that if she joined forces with the king of Dali, they would not be afraid of that first stage venerable sovereign!The two of them didn't have any goals. They only had one request, which was to find a relatively peaceful place where they could develop in peace for a period of time. She and the king of Dali were both walking the path of Kings, so it was best to find a place where the human race was suppressed and liberate them ...That first stage venerable sovereign had done his best to send them to this place. It was indeed a treasure land. Moreover, the world Lord was not strong. He was only a first stage venerable sovereign. Although he was considered powerful in the local area ... It was just so-so.It was a pretty good place, but it was said that this place was on the edge of the Dragon field.The king of Dali stopped thinking about it and exhaled."Well, let's not think about this. There are still many humans here who have been enslaved. They have been enslaved for too long and have been tortured. If we treat them a little better, they will dare to give their hearts and lungs to us ... If we make this place our base ... Make it our territory. After we kill that world Lord, we will be the overlords of this place. We will have a lair ..."In Silver Moon, Li Hao was the boss, and below him were Silver moon's men. The two of them were pitiful and often fell into Li Hao's schemes, so ... If they had to take a risk, so be it. They could be the real boss for once!"This is right!"The Queen laughed and said,"you be the Emperor of Dali, and I will be my God!" The power of a monarch and the power of a God were the same! When our territory expands and we become stronger, we'll go our separate ways! You walk the path of the common people, I walk the Path of the Gods!" The king of Dali nodded. This was also what he thought. Anyway, he would not stay with the Queen all the time. Otherwise, would the theocracy or the monarch be the dominant one?"Then ... Shall we vindicate our Dao?""No rush!"The Queen shook her head."You have to know that we are not venerable sovereigns now. So, the other party doesn't pay much attention to us. If we become venerable sovereigns ... Then the other party will pay great attention to us!" Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  The Queen chuckled and said,"besides, becoming a first stage venerable sovereign ... Is not our goal!" We should learn from li daoheng and the others ... If they don't become venerable sovereigns, if they do, they'll at least be third rank! It's formed from the accumulation of countless faith power and directly entered the 3rd grade!""At that time, even if something unexpected happens, there won't be any mishaps if two rank 3s act together!"The Dali King nodded. This was true.The power of faith here was too dense.Moreover, it was too easy for the people to join. Now that some mantras were being passed down, these people were all devoted to cultivation. They were not easy to talk to. Even he felt a little embarrassed.In the past, the people of Li Dynasty were much more difficult to serve than these people.The two discussed for a while more before getting back to work. At this moment, they were full of energy and were much more motivated than they had been back at Silver Moon.……At this moment, a sound came from the Black Panther's stomach."My Lord, the king of the Li Dynasty and the Queen of the West ... Might also be in the Dragon field!"It was Qian Wuliang's voice."In the Dragon field?" Li Hao was surprised."Yes,""They're here?""Yes, in the great Dao universe, the stars that belong to them ... Seem to be approaching them!"Li Hao was surprised. Why did they come to the Dragon field?It's quite far, alright!He could really run.Most importantly, it was not easy for them to survive until now. These two should not have become venerable sovereigns yet. Although they did not major in the Silver Moon Dao, their stars should have some changes if they became venerable sovereigns.
