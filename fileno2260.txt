As expected ... This fellow is my lifelong enemy!Ying Hongyue's eyes flickered. Just as she was about to speak, Li Hao said,"Alright, you don't have to say anything. Just tell me how to use the eight divine weapons and open some seals!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"It has nothing to do with the eight divine weapons ..." Ying Hongyue took a deep breath.Li Hao ignored him and went on."That's not right. Just tell me directly. How do you take my main body in through the eight blood veins? do you have to wrap my body with a divine weapon?" "I've used my spirit to enter the eight trigrams through the eight blood veins ... And these eight blood veins require a divine weapon or the spread of the bloodline ... But only spirit can enter, not the physical body! I don't want to cause too much of a commotion and attract attention. "Ying Hongyue was completely speechless. She only spoke after a long while, "It's fine as long as you have a divine weapon!""It's that simple?"Ying Hongyue nodded."It's best to enter through the main city. This seal is actually somewhat related to the main city. Zhang an was able to enter smoothly not because he's powerful, but because he controlled the Galaxy city. That's why he was able to enter smoothly!" If you don't want to enter the main city directly, then you can use the main city's city Lord seal, fuse it with one of the eight divine weapons, and then use the blood line to enter!""Also ..." He continued,"although the venerable sovereign has been sealed, if the eight divine weapons are taken by him, he may be able to merge with the divine weapons and walk out! Don't you do anything stupid ..."They weren't afraid that Li Hao would die, but that Li Hao would torture everyone to death!At this moment, Ying Hongyue felt that this fellow was much more difficult to deal with than Zheng Yu and the others.He knows me too well!A minor character ... Also received so much attention?The eight godly weapons were almost all broken and devoured by Li Hao's starry sky sword. Although the starry sky sword was broken, it had almost recovered. This was the only one of the eight godly weapons.No, there was still that turtle from the Wang family.Ying Hongyue was also thinking this when she heard Li Hao suddenly say,"The Hong family's hammer is with Zi Yue now?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"Didn't you break it a few days ago?"Ying Hongyue frowned.Li Hao couldn't help but laugh,"nonsense!" Other than the one from the Wang family, none of the eight divine weapons had any consciousness. The one from the Wang family only had consciousness because he was born a long time ago. The hammer from the Hong family was only born later, so it was impossible for it to be forged with the soul of a demon. However, the hammer that devoured the Hong family still had some consciousness ... Where did you get a replica from? It was quite real, and it looked like it was true! Even your blood veins have dimmed. Could it be that you used your own bloodline power to forge it?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùAt this moment, Ying Hongyue's head was splitting! "Why don't you try killing me?""You're full of lies. You're really ... Unbearable!"In an instant, Li Hao appeared, and his sword pierced through the world! Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  His 99 Dao meridians instantly merged together and he slashed out with his sword. The sky collapsed and the earth cracked. However, he wasn't slashing at Ying Hongyue but the forbidden Sea!BOOM!A deafening explosion resounded through the world. The forbidden Sea was even cut off. At this moment, Ying Hongyue spurted out a mouthful of blood. She looked at Li Hao and, without saying a word, instantly threw out countless Crimson Moon Power. Then, he threw out another city leader seal and coughed out blood.""Here you go ... This is the Hong family's city Lord seal ... The key to a main city is actually this, without this ...""Fake!"Li Hao shattered it with his sword!With a loud boom and an extremely powerful force, Li Hao said indifferently,""You won't bring the real treasures with you. There's a high chance that they're with the purple Moon! I don't believe a single word that you say. I only believe in my own deductions. Thus ... Don't even think about trying to pull any tricks in front of me. I only believe in myself! I want the city Lord seal and the Hong clan's hammer. Three days later, I want to see these two treasures in Silver City. If I don't see them ... I'll attack windstorm city ... And make Zheng Yu hand over the flying sword immortal! There's a high chance that the flying sword immortal is Zi Yue in disguise. Otherwise, why would you leave her behind? You ... You have too many ideas. ""I didn't think as much as you did!" Ying Hongyue seemed a little bitter.Li Hao laughed."Don't say that. I'm just following your train of thought. If I were you ... I would also resist!" Of course, I'm the passive one, while you're the one who took the initiative to be the bait, to lure everyone and resist ... You're still the stronger one, so ... Sooner or later, I'll Still Kill your entire family. You and Ziyue, no matter who's real or fake, it's the same!"As Li Hao spoke, he absorbed a large amount of the Crimson Moon's power, and his eyes flickered with red light.Soon, the Crimson Moon's power was obliterated in her body. Ying Hongyue's eyelids twitched when she saw this. Li Hao said,""Also ... Don't try to refine the forbidden Sea into your clone or original body! You have a lot of ideas and ambitions. Are you deliberately making people think that you're just transferring the Crimson Moon's power through the forbidden Sea?"Ying Hongyue's expression completely changed. She looked at Li Hao and said with a frown,"Li Hao! You're very annoying, do you understand?"No wonder Li Hao only attacked the forbidden Sea!Li Hao laughed,"do I hate it?" No, no, no, I'm very kind. Everyone likes me, but you don 't. It doesn't matter! If you dare to refine the forbidden Sea again, I'll let the God of beginner martial of the Li Dynasty deal with you! It's hard for me to obliterate them now, but the other party might be able to ...""Laughable, can you make the other party attack?"Ying Hongyue suddenly stiffened and looked at Li Hao coldly. Li Hao said meaningfully,"There must be something that he cares about! Like ... The Li Dynasty? Everyone has some weaknesses. I have them, you have them, and everyone has them!"

Ying Hongyue didn't say anything. She only spoke after a long time,"Three days later, I'll place the items in the Silver City's Inspection Office ... If the inspection Office is still there! If it's not there, then it's near there. Go find it yourself! In addition ... I won't refine the forbidden Sea anymore. Li Hao, what do you think?""Alright, I can!"Li Hao nodded and chuckled. The next moment, he struck again, one strike after another!The forbidden Sea shook violently!Ying Hongyue was furious. At this moment, she seemed to be truly angry. The forbidden Sea churned wildly as the eight great bloodlines instantly fused together. An extremely powerful force erupted as she punched out with a Thunderbolt!BOOM!The heavens fell and the earth cracked! At this moment, he seemed to be the real him. He was incomparably strong, which made Hong Yitang and Heibao dumbfounded.As for Li Hao, he madly slashed dozens of times, causing the forbidden Sea to tremble violently. Countless Crimson Moon forces overflowed, and a large amount of energy scattered.In the blink of an eye, they were all devoured by Li Hao!After fighting for a while, Li Hao instantly withdrew his domain. Ying Hongyue also stopped fighting. She didn't say anything and just looked at Li Hao in silence."I'll come and find you again!"Li Hao smiled.Then, he disappeared.Hong Yitang and Heibao also disappeared instantly.At this moment, the forbidden Sea was constantly trembling as if it had been injured. It was struggling in pain. Ying Hongyue's expression kept changing, but she still didn't say a word. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  After a long time, he said in a low voice,"Li Hao!"Even he had forgotten some of the clues, but Li Hao remembered them all!He remembered everything. Even when he was weak, he remembered some situations with his eyes. Furthermore, he would constantly connect some things together.This guy, doesn't he feel that his life is very tiring?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao coughed and said with a smile,""That's amazing!"Hong Yitang was a little shocked, he said,""This guy ... Has he hidden so deeply?""A guy who took the initiative to come out and act as bait for the venerable sovereigns, half-step sovereigns, and the Li family's Black Hand, of course he's not simple! "I don't have such courage. I just happened to sort out the great Dao and realized that Ziyue's Dao was wrong. After connecting the dots, I thought of many things ... Also, I was able to fuse the Dao with the Galaxy myself, so it's normal for someone to fuse the Dao with the forbidden Sea ... It's normal for him to push others by himself. In addition, this guy is bold enough to even dare to use the Dao of lightning ... It's normal for him to think more."Was it normal?Hong Yitang thought about it. It was not normal at all! Also, this fellow wants the Hong clan's hammer and the city Lord seal. Could it be that ... He really intends to enter the seal?"Then just now ... Why didn't you think of a way to kill him?""I can't kill him, I can't kill him now! I'll cut some of his flesh and let him rest for now. I'll cut it off later. Of course, this guy is easy to breed a Tiger ... But I'm not afraid of him!"Hong Yitang sighed with emotion."Thirty-six heroes ... As expected, this fellow has hidden the deepest!"Li Hao nodded slightly and didn't say anything.At this moment, he was flying rapidly in the direction of the Imperial Palace of Dali.Seeing that he was going to the palace of Dali again ... Hong Yitang felt that the king of Dali probably hated this guy to the core. He had attacked several times, but he had not gotten any benefits. Now, he had even lost the favor of heaven, and this guy still dared to go. Was he really not afraid that the God of beginner martial would come out and fight him?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The king of Dali was still cultivating when he suddenly opened his eyes. His gaze was very complicated, and he couldn't help but curse in a low voice,""Again!"How many times had it been?Every time, he would suffer a huge loss and gain nothing.Cooperating with Li Hao was the stupidest decision!But ... You can't say anything.He gritted his teeth in anger. Go to the temple and find that person ... If Li Hao dares to fool this king again today ... Gather all your strength and kill him!"Detestable bastard!Do you really think this King is that stupid to be used by you?You didn't get the God Country, and you even lost the Heaven's Will. What else do you want this time?At this moment, in the distance, Jiang Li also had mixed feelings. He had disappeared. He had really gone to the temple, not to kill Li Hao, but to inform the God of beginner martial ... To see if he could drive this guy away!If this guy came to the Li Dynasty a few more times ... Even if the Li Dynasty didn't merge with the Heavenly Star, it would be destroyed by Li Hao!In the distant temple, an illusionary figure also glanced in the direction where Li Hao had come from ... And felt a little annoyed.Again!Should I beat him up and make him scram?

2262 Chapter 379
The Imperial Palace of Dali.Li Hao was familiar with the place and walked straight in.This time, he didn't travel through the void. He entered openly. In the palace, some divine guards could only watch. They couldn't stop him at all.In the main hall, the king of Dali sat on the throne.When he saw Li Hao enter, he was expressionless and only coldly looked at him."King of Dali, I've come to see you."Li Hao entered the room and laughed. Even before he arrived, he had almost ignited the king of Dali.Fortunately, the Dali King still endured it.His tone was still calm,"Marchioness Silvermoon is here, please take a seat, it looks like she has recovered from her injuries.""I have to thank the king of Dali for his support."Support?Support my ass!You said that I would at least be able to reach the Dao integration stage if the will of the heavens were to dissipate, but what happened?You still have the nerve to come again?The king of Dali thought to himself and nodded slightly without saying anything.The less you say, the less mistakes you make.He didn't care what Li Hao said, but this time ... He would pretend he didn't hear it. Li Hao wanted the Li Dynasty to send troops, and the Li Dynasty sent troops. He wanted this King to offer the will of heaven.What else do you want now?Seeing that he was a man of few words, Li Hao smiled and didn't mind. He sat down and asked Hong Yitang to sit down as well.They seemed to be very familiar with each other.He then turned around and shouted,"where's officiant Jiang?" Let's sit down and talk!"Outside the door, Jiang Li didn't say anything or respond.Li Hao laughed,"the palace of Dali seems a little cold."The Dali King said,"he is indeed a little cold. Not as good as the Marchioness of Silver Moon. I didn't expect that the Marchioness of Silver Moon would be so young. He is about to get married. I forgot to congratulate him."He was also surprised by this news.He roughly understood that it was necessary for the situation, so he used it to provoke Li Hao.In the end, Li Hao nodded."That's right. Men should start their own families when they're of age. The king of Dali is not young anymore, so he should do the same. Otherwise, it's easy for people to gossip about the king of Dali and officiant Jiang in the palace."The Dali King's face turned cold.Bastard!Outside the hall, Jiang Li innocently took a few steps back and disappeared in front of Li Hao, almost sticking to the wall. This man was not a good person, and he should not have talked to him.The king of the Li Dynasty was a straightforward man, and he would only humiliate himself by saying this to Li Hao. "Marchioness Silvermoon, is there a reason for you to come?"The king of Dali just wanted to get rid of Li Hao as soon as possible, so he was a little impatient.Li Hao laughed."It's like this. Previously, due to an accident, my realm fell, but the king of Dali didn't improve. In addition, in order to deal with the Western divine Kingdom, he seized the divine Kingdom. He blames himself very much. Those who work with me, Li Hao, have always paid back.""I'm here in Dali to make up for my mistake last time ..."The Dali King was stunned.Was he here to give him benefits?He couldn't believe it. However, Li Hao ... He didn't suffer any losses in the previous cooperation. For example, he had obtained a lot of resources in the battle of endless city.Below, Li Hao continued,"however, I have too few resources on hand right now. The benefits are too small. I don't have anything good either. In fact, there are ultimate treasures within the Li Dynasty!" The forbidden sea's source is from the North!""I've thought about it ... Why don't we compress the forbidden Sea? the forbidden Sea runs through heaven and earth, and I want to compress it into the Li Dynasty. This is a land of treasures and also a Holy Land. It has countless resources and energy ... If we compress the forbidden Sea into the Li Dynasty, the Li Dynasty's energy will increase by more than 30%!""This is to increase the foundation of the entire country ... And not just those treasures without a source! There will be a time when the energy stones are used up, but the energy in the forbidden Sea is an endless extraction of the energy of heaven and earth. This is the true treasure!""Now, the forbidden Sea is also the treasure of the entire Heavenly Star ... However, Heavenly Star is vast and abundant in resources. I don't mind losing one Forbidden Sea. King of Dali, if you want it, I promise to compress the forbidden Sea and suppress it within the boundaries of Dali!"The Dali King was stunned. This time, his thoughts were wavering, and he didn't know how to respond.The forbidden Sea ... Was indeed a land of treasures.Of course, it was also very dangerous.The corrosive power of the sea water was extremely strong!However, there were many treasures in this sea, including the most common Sky Golden Lotus. Li Hao had even consumed a petal in the past, which was a treasure that could improve one's spiritual power and force. There were actually many in the forbidden Sea.Now that the world was recovering, many places were recovering and rising. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  However, when it came to treasures ... Perhaps the forbidden Sea had the most natural treasures.The forbidden sea's energy was rich. If he could really compress it within the Li Dynasty, then the density of the energy in the Li Dynasty would instantly increase by a lot.Furthermore, as time passed, it would only become more and more intense.Li Hao continued,"that's not all. The forbidden Sea ... The current Forbidden Sea was actually just a reflection of the origin world. Now, it seems to have its own spirit. Everything in the mountains and rivers has a spirit!" If he could capture the spirit of the forbidden Sea, he might not be inferior to the Heaven's Will! The forbidden Sea is not ordinary. If it is compressed into the Li Dynasty, it can even use the Cang mountains as a boundary and the forbidden Sea can be spread across the world ... In the future, if the Li Dynasty and Heavenly Star want to fight, they will have to cross the forbidden Sea!""If the king of Dali doesn't want to be under my control, then we can't count on the Cang Mountain. It's easy to cross the Cang Mountain, but difficult to cross the forbidden Sea. This is the true natural chasm!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Dali King didn't say anything.Are you moved?He was tempted.However, he knew that things were not as simple as they seemed!If it was simple, would Li Hao be so kind?He fell silent, but Li Hao's words made sense. The Li Dynasty was not willing to surrender and wanted independence, but the Cang mountains were no longer a natural chasm. If the forbidden Sea was a natural chasm ... What would happen?

At that time, unless it was a top-notch expert, anyone else would be able to overcome it.In the forbidden Sea of the new martial era, even the peak would be corroded completely.p "The forbidden Sea is so important," King Dali said."The Marchioness of Silvermoon can take it for herself!"Li Hao laughed."It's not that I can't ... If the king of Dali doesn't want it, I'll take it myself. Since the source is in Dali, I think it's not appropriate for me to take it away without saying a word since we're brothers!" But now that the king of Dali doesn't want it ... I'll take it. ""Wait!"The Dali King said instantly.He looked at Li Hao and frowned.If you don't want it, you'll take it?At this moment, he was slightly conflicted and quickly said,""Jiang Li!"Outside the palace.When Jiang Li appeared again, the king of Dali said slowly,""Did you hear what Marchioness Silvermoon just said? Do you think that ... The Li Dynasty needs a barrier?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùJiang Li was also conflicted.They did, but Li Hao said it. They were worried about Li Hao.At this moment, Jiang Li felt helpless. He looked at Li Hao.""Lord Marquis ... The three great organizations have entered the forbidden Sea before. Is there any problem? Since Lord Marquis has said that he will help us compress ... If there is a problem, why don't you just tell us so that we can make our judgment?"Li Hao laughed,"what problem can there be?" Ying Hongyue's ambition was probably not small, and she wanted to refine the forbidden Sea! As I said, the forbidden Sea has a spirit. Once it's refined, the entire sea might become his avatar or even his true body!""It'll be very troublesome then!""Right now, the other party should only be at the beginning. Therefore, as long as we can expel Ying Hongyue's refinement, there won't be any problems!"He was waiting here!The Dali King was just about to speak when Li Hao said,""Of course, it's fine if they don't expel it. If they really refine it, the forbidden sea's source is in Dali. If the forbidden Sea is refined and taken away, then the entire Dali dynasty will instantly become a barren land, and its energy will be extracted!"The Dali King was stunned and did not speak again. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Li Hao continued,"Ying Hongyue still has a chance of success. He's very powerful!" Second, he has been trying to penetrate the power of the Crimson Moon into the forbidden Sea. You don't really think he's trying to consume the power of the Crimson Moon, do you?"Li Hao laughed and said,"it's really not!" He was trying to infect the Crimson Moon's power, the entire Forbidden Sea, and assimilate it! Ying Hongyue wasn't afraid of the power of the red moon. If he was afraid, would he have continued to extract it? The feeling he gave everyone was that he was using the bloodline of the eight great families to resist the power of the Crimson Moon ... In fact, he could have fused these two powers long ago!""At that time, if we succeed, Ying Hongyue will be very difficult to deal with!""Of course, the Li Dynasty will be the first to bear the brunt of it. After all, the source is in Li Dynasty!"Li Hao instantly said a lot. The king of Dali pondered for a while and slowly said,""Ying Hongyue is refining the forbidden Sea ... The forbidden Sea can actually be refined into a clone ... This ...""I can even devour the Silvermoon world, much less the ocean."Li Hao laughed,"to the strong, there's nothing they can't swallow!" There's nothing that can't be refined!"That was true!He could refine even the heavens and earth, let alone an ocean."Ying Hongyue ... What's her current strength?" the Dali King frowned."Initial stage of the sage realm. However, if you unleash your full potential, you might even reach the late stage of the sage realm! If he refines the forbidden Sea ... He might even be able to break through all the restrictions and become a Heavenly King!""In addition, Ying Hongyue is still absorbing some of the eight great families" inheritances. Once she succeeds ... Perhaps she'll be able to take a step further!" He can even absorb the power of the Crimson Moon ... In fact, this guy has many, many trump cards!"The Dali King's expression changed slightly.Jiang Li was also a bit solemn. He said in a low voice,""Is what Lord Marquis said true?""What's there to be fake about?"Li Hao smiled."In addition, if the Dali King can refine it ... He will be greatly strengthened. Although he no longer has heaven's will, the forbidden Sea is still a part of heaven and earth, an extremely important part. He can even be considered to have received the blessing of heaven's will and won't be affected by it!" He said. Once it can be refined, the sage and Heavenly King will be waiting for you!""Don't all the experts want to become stronger? If the king of Dali wanted to protect Dali, how could he do it without strength? Could it be that he had always been counting on that beginner stage expert? This is not appropriate!"The king of Dali was silent.He didn't want to pay attention to Li Hao, but ... He really couldn't help it.Did Li Hao's words make sense?Of course!Every time Li Hao says something grand, the kind that you can't refuse, but ... Does this bastard want me to fight Ying Hongyue?As he was thinking, Li Hao continued,'if the king of Dali wants to do it, he needs to suppress and drive out Ying Hongyue! However ... We don't know much about the forbidden Sea. It's the beginner martial stage powerhouses who know a lot. Moreover, only those with that kind of strength can drive away Ying Hongyue!"He understood!He was using someone else to kill!The Dali King's expression changed slightly. He looked at Li Hao and said coldly,""Marchioness Silvermoon wants me to invite the God of beginner martial to kill Ying Hongyue?""I'm not asking you to pay ... If you want the forbidden Sea, you have to work hard for it. I can't give it to you, right?"Li Hao laughed,"I can make it myself, but ... If I make it, why would I give it to you?" "Now that heaven and earth are recovering for the first time, there aren't many opportunities. I'm in charge of the great path of the universe, so there's still a chance. Let me ask you, king of Dali ... What other great opportunities do you have that can allow you to step into the Dao integration realm or even the Heavenly King realm in a day? Do you? What I have, Ying Hongyue also has, Zheng Yu has always been one, and venerable sovereign Red Moon is already a venerable sovereign ... Only you, you're only at the seventh level of the sun Moon realm, where did you get the opportunity?"

2264 Chapter 379
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùA lucky chance!Did I?I didn 't!There were not many opportunities in the world now.The Li Dynasty was a barren place with few historical remains, so how could there be any great opportunities?After thinking about Li Hao's words carefully, he realized that they actually made a lot of sense.If he didn't fight for it, how could there be any opportunities?I'm only at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier ... Li Hao and the others have their own methods of improvement, but what about me?The Li Dynasty wanted to be independent, but it didn't have the strength, so how could it be?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.When Jiang Li saw it, he immediately realized that the king was tempted!Li Hao, you don't have good intentions!"My King!" He coughed hastily.They had agreed to kill Li Hao with all their might, but now that he was here, they had only exchanged a few words in less than three minutes, and he wanted to help him again?Good Lord, in three minutes, Li Hao had already made the Li Dynasty King work for him!Ying Hongyue was Li Hao's greatest enemy!The Dali King instantly sobered up, his expression not too good. Li Hao...Damn it!This guy's words always carried an infinite temptation.But if you really eat it ... You'll know that it's actually poisonous bait!"Li Hao!"The king of Dali suppressed his excitement and said calmly,""It's not that simple, right?"Li Hao nodded,"Ying Hongyue is difficult to deal with!" He might even have some trump cards, but there's still some danger. Some time ago, I sensed that he was refining the forbidden Sea, and the power of the Crimson Moon even infected the sea-suppressing emissary li Fuhai who suppressed the forbidden Sea. "This is only the first reason. The second reason is the recovery of the forbidden Sea. Under normal circumstances, according to the new martial artists, their Forbidden Sea was born because an unparalleled expert died.""Then how come the forbidden Sea of Silvermoon has such a corrosive power? How did such a powerful force appear? Is it all because of the blessing of heaven and earth?"At this moment, Li Hao didn't hide anything and shared his speculation.""I Theor...It's just a guess, and I can't be sure. The bones of a peerless master might also be in the forbidden Sea! Even if he's not a venerable sovereign, he's still a half-step sovereign!"The Dali King was stunned,"how could that be?" Silvermoon only has one venerable sovereign, and that is venerable Swordmaster!"That's bullshit!Li Hao laughed, I don't know, maybe God knows! The source is in the Li Dynasty, which means that if there is, the skeleton might have been born in the Li Dynasty ... Don't ask me, if possible, go ask that God!"Li Hao laughed."The forbidden Sea doesn't possess corrosive power for no reason. It also doesn't recover naturally for no reason. There must be something in the sea!"The Dali King's eyes flickered.He looked at Li Hao in disbelief. The corpse of a half-step sovereign or even a venerable sovereign?Was that even possible?In the entire land of Silver Moon, there was only one venerable sword ... And perhaps the sealed venerable sovereign was still alive and well. If there was really a half-step sovereign or venerable sovereign who died, the whole world would have been shocked, right?However, he had never heard of it before!There were no records of it in history.Li Hao made such a speculation based on the new martial arts Forbidden Sea. The forbidden Sea of new martial arts was caused by the death of a top venerable sovereign.The so-called corrosive power was formed by some of their remnant thoughts. Their blood dripped and merged into the ocean, causing the ocean to have an extremely powerful corrosive power.However, the Silver Moon land didn't have such a situation, so how could a similar Forbidden Sea be born?The source happened to be in Dali. There was another mysterious God of beginner martial in Dali.Thinking about that, Li Hao added, by the way, officiant Jiang Li, didn't you use the divine bone of beginner martial all the time? Could it be ... That it was the God's own bone? Did they break the bones for you to use? The primary martial divine bone ... Means that an expert has died. Just a few pieces of that bone banner can raise him to the late stage of the sun Moon realm ... The owner of this bone banner must have been at least a peak Saint or even a Heavenly King in the past, right?""You guys used the bones, didn't you think about where the bones came from?" he asked, puzzled.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùSilence!The king of Dali looked at Jiang Li, who was a little embarrassed. I ... I really thought it was the God of beginner martial!Li Hao was right. Would they break their bones for you to use?He must have killed someone to have these bones. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The king of Dali even wanted to scratch his head. At this moment, he also felt Li Hao's demonic aura. This guy was always able to quickly deduce things from clues that no one cared about.The formation method of the forbidden Sea, the source of the forbidden Sea, and the primary martial divine bone that Jiang Li used ...This series of clues led Li Hao to conclude that the corpse of a top-notch expert should be in the forbidden Sea ... And if the forbidden Sea had a spirit, it might have been formed from this corpse.As for Ying Hongyue, she might be looking for this ... Of course, Li Hao didn't mention it to Ying Hongyue. Ying Hongyue might not know, but she might know, because that guy was also a smart person.It could only be said that the two from the Li Dynasty were not very smart!He had been here the whole time and didn't seem to notice at all.The forbidden Sea had recovered, and he had allowed it to recover ... He didn't seem to feel any difference at all.In fact, even Hong Yitang was a little dazed as he listened.Was it like this?The awakening of the forbidden Sea ... No one thought too much about it. The new martial artists didn't think too much about it. Li Hao, on the other hand, thought too much!Everyone thought that it was only natural for the forbidden Sea to recover as the world recovered.The Dali King couldn't hold it in anymore."You mean there are bones in the sea now ... Maybe the bones have recovered and are very powerful ... Plus, Ying Hongyue is also thinking about the forbidden Sea ... So, it's very dangerous?"

"Right!"The king of Dali was silent for a while."The source is here ... Then if there is really a strong person in the sea, he was ... Killed by our God of beginner martial?""I don't know. You can ask him yourself. How would I know?"At this moment, Jiang Li said awkwardly,""So, the bone I used, could ... Could be the bone of the expert who was killed?"Li Hao nodded."That's why I asked you to find it yourself. It's very likely that Jiang Li can find the real skeleton with the bones!" This skeleton might be the core of the forbidden Sea! Ying Hongyue was most likely looking for it as well. The skeleton of a top-notch expert ... Was a precious treasure to everyone! And ... The other party might even be an expert from the early stage of martial arts! Because the bone you used was the beginner martial white jade bone!"Li Hao continued,'as far as I know, not many people can cultivate the beginner level white jade bone! And anyone who could refine such a bone was not weak! At that time, whether you control the forbidden Sea, the Dali King, Jiang Li, or both of you ... It will be an opportunity! Not to mention venerable sovereigns, there was still hope for half-step sovereigns. The road ahead was right in front of them! As the inheritor of celestial ruler Batian, you need this kind of power. It's actually more suitable for you than the Dao universe!""Everyone has their own suitable power ... If the forbidden Sea is really formed by a beginner martial artist, it's the most suitable for you, King Dali!"There's nothing wrong with that!At this moment, the Dali King no longer thought of expelling Li Hao, nor did he think that he would use all his strength to kill him!This guy was divine!He started to think about something and kept looking at Jiang Li. Jiang Li was absent-minded and sometimes looked at the temple behind him.Could it be that ... Our God of beginner's level had really killed a top beginner's level expert?Beginner stage martial artists, if they were alive, they would at least be at the Heavenly King level, right?Even a pseudo-Emperor was nothing.But ... Isn't our God also a beginner stage martial artist?A beginner martial artist killing a beginner martial artist?Who was the one who was killed?Who do we believe in?Why did he want to kill him?Even the bones were broken and used as a special item for the temple officiant ... This ... Was extremely ruthless!Jiang Li was distracted by all these thoughts and didn't notice the few eye signals from the king of Dali.Seeing this, the Dali King was also a little helpless.Finally, he looked at Li Hao."Then ... Do you think that if this skeleton is resurrected, it will be very powerful?" he asked."If it really awakens ... Saints won't be able to escape. Even Heavenly Kings might be able to! The other party might not be able to leave the forbidden Sea, but it would be difficult to take him down! Otherwise, I'll take it myself. But I'm not confident, so I'll let you guys think of a way!"Li Hao said softly,"you can't get something without working. The clues and information I provided are enough for you to pay back. So ... You didn't lose out last time!" If you succeed, I think you'll be a Saint at the start. If you use it well, you'll have a place in the future!"  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  The Dali King snorted and said,""You're doing this to deal with Ying Hongyue. Otherwise, why would you be so kind?"Li Hao laughed,"let's talk about traces and not the heart!" You don't need to know why I did it. I gave you a chance, is there a problem?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùShe was speechless."Jiang Li!" The king of Dali took a deep breath."Here!"Jiang Li replied in a hurry.The king of Dali said,"you and I ... Shall go and meet that person!" Marchioness Silvermoon, wait here for a moment. We will let you know when we have made a decision!" "Please do!"Li Hao smiled.Jiang Li was a little conflicted, but he didn't say anything. He walked out of the palace with the king of Dali.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After they left, Hong Yitang couldn't help but laugh.""The king of Dali ... He's really honest,"Li Hao shook his head,"I didn't plot against him." He doesn't have many opportunities to become stronger. This is indeed an opportunity. If he didn't agree, I would find it strange. A King tier actually gave up an opportunity to become stronger because he was afraid of being schemed against!"The king of Dali did not stand a chance.And now, Li Hao had come to him.Could he not catch it?If he didn't catch him ... The Dali King would be crippled.To be able to obtain the inheritance of celestial ruler Batian, the Dali King was not that useless.Hong Yitang nodded slightly. It was indeed an open scheme. Li Hao could have kept some things to himself, but he still did. He didn't know about this beforehand."You're saying that a beginner martial artist died in the forbidden Sea, and the source is in Dali ... So ..."Hong Yitang muttered.Who was the one who killed him?Then, how strong was the one who stayed in the Li Dynasty?Li Hao smiled and said telepathically,'who knows Who Killed Who? the one that the Li Dynasty originally believed in might be the skeleton! Who can say for sure?" A dove occupying The Magpie's Nest?Hong Yitang was shocked!It was not impossible.The Li Dynasty did not even know who they believed in ... Of course, to the Li Dynasty, it was almost the same. The winner was King.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.In the Dali divine Hall.The king of Dali straightened his clothes and stepped into the temple.The temple was very spacious.There wasn't anything like a statue, just an altar-like thing with some food placed on it. It was very simple, and this was the famous yang God Palace!That's right, this place had always been called the Yang God Hall."Li Dynasty, Beiwu, greets my God!"The Dali King bowed slightly and was very polite.Beiwu was his real name.However, no one called him by his real name, unlike Li Hao, who used his real name when he was weak and was known by many people.

The temple was extremely quiet.The Dali King raised his eyebrows slightly and said,""Star King Li Hao, the descendant of the sword venerable, is here to inform you that the forbidden Sea has recovered, and there are remains of beginner level martial artists, which may have given birth to spirits! Ying Hongyue is trying to refine the forbidden Sea. My God, Can Li Hao's words be true?"Silence.After a while, an indifferent voice sounded in the hall,""At such a young age, you're already so calculative and full of ideas ... That's true."The Dali King was shocked!As expected!Li Hao ... Was indeed a prodigy of the current generation. With just a few words and some clues, he had deduced the truth."Then ... Does the bone of initial stage martial artist that Jiang Li used have the same origin as the skeleton in the sea?" he asked again."Yes, I took out some of the strongest bones back then ... But most of them were thrown away ..."He really did kill her!"So, the experts in the sea were killed by my God?" the Dali King asked, his mouth dry."Not bad.""Then ..."Before the king of Dali could finish, his indifferent voice sounded again,""You're going to take it? It's just an abandoned skeleton ... Of course, this is indeed an opportunity for you! Moreover, since the forbidden Sea has been born ... It means that he has obtained some good fortune from heaven and earth. It should be different from before!"The Dali King was a little nervous."It's said that ... He's very difficult to deal with. He even has the power of a Sage and even a Heavenly King ... Can my God ...""I'm not going!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe king of Dali was stunned. Why?It's just a skeleton you killed. If you go and get it, won't it be as easy as pinching it with your hand?  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  The Li Dynasty ... Is the country you're protecting.Why didn't he give them any face?Jiang Li couldn't help but say,"my God, now all parties are fighting for hegemony, and the great li is weak!" If ... If we can really take over the forbidden Sea and drive away Ying Hongyue, the Li Dynasty will also have a chance ...""Where would I get the chance?"The God's tone was calm,"you?" Counting on Beiwu? His combat strength is average, his brain is average, and he has only been to the Li Dynasty a few times. He can deduce everything in the blink of an eye, no matter big or small. He also has many experts and geniuses under his command ... Can you ... Defeat him?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùSilence.The king of Dali was a little embarrassed.Can you win?Probably ... No match?However, he still said,"if I can become a top-notch powerhouse, I can defeat ten people with my own strength ... No matter how many schemes I have, they will all be in vain!."My brain might not be as good as his, but if I'm stronger than him ... I'll just beat him up until he has no choice but to admit defeat and it'll be over!"Furthermore ... The Li Dynasty still has the senior ..." "I don't care!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"I'm just living here. You're not my descendants or clansmen ... Of course, I've lived here for many years to form a good relationship with you. That's why I'm protecting you!" The godly language sounded again."As for that skeleton, I killed him once in the past ... The Grudge is settled! And if he awakens now, that's his ability, not mine! Besides ... Now that he's recovered, he's no longer the person he was back then. It's just a remnant of his spirit. The world isn't perfect yet, and he's only at the power of a Heavenly King ... If you want to deal with him, you can do it yourself!" ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùIt was the power of a Heavenly King!There were ... Too many meanings in his words.In that case, that person back then could really be a pseudo-Emperor?Or even ... A venerable sovereign that he did not dare to think about?That was impossible!If he was a venerable sovereign, then what was this person in front of him?Was the existence that killed venerable sovereigns really the sun god?"That man ... Was he a venerable sovereign when he was alive?""No!"The language of gods sounded again,'if it's a venerable sovereign ... Can the forbidden Sea accommodate him? He's not as strong as the young master of the Zheng family, just at that level ... He's been dead for many years, and his bones are incomplete. The world has just been revived, so he's not as strong as you think!"But ... It could also be a Heavenly King!King Dali gasped."This ... Heavenly King ... Also, this Heavenly King ... Is he the Heavenly King in senior's eyes? or is he the Heavenly King of this era?"This had to be asked clearly!In Chu Wu's eyes, the Heavenly King was the Heavenly King of the origin era. The Heavenly King of this era ... Was the Saint of that era. These two could not be mentioned in the same breath."Also, the beginner level doesn't rely on the origin!Perhaps, the Heavenly King in his mouth was the real Heavenly King!That was actually Zheng Yu, who was at the half-step sovereign realm!"Of course it's this era!""If it was the Heavenly King from back then ... The forbidden Sea would have covered half of the Silver Moon. How could it be so small?" the God replied.Alright!He felt a little more at ease.But ... She still felt uneasy!He was too strong!A Heavenly King!Up to this day, only Li Hao's team had killed a Heavenly King. However, the situation was that the five desolate beasts were killed by the other party first. In the end, Li Hao's team used some unknown method to kill the Heavenly King.As for how he was killed ... No one knew.Even Zheng Yu probably couldn't figure out how the head of the Zheng family had died. Even if Li Hao and the others joined forces, they didn't have the strength to kill the head of the Zheng family."Then ... If I can seize the forbidden Sea, refine it, and refine the skeleton ..." The Dali King said after a moment of silence."Your inheritance is very powerful. If you can really succeed, you will become a saint and a Heavenly King ... Not far away!"The king of Dali took a deep breath. Li Hao was right again!At this moment, they only felt that Li Hao was truly terrifying ... They even forgot that the person in front of them was the expert who had killed that person."Other than this place ... Is there any other chance for Silvermoon to make beginner martial stage powerhouses stronger?""Very few,""Of course not!" The deity replied."There are other ways to do so ... For example, the one in the seal. Kill him, and the bones of a venerable sovereign will be more than enough to make you stronger!"

2267 Chapter 379
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùYou're bullshitting!"For example, you don't have to learn from the Li clan's great path universe to control it. After you enter, you can directly devour countless Natal stars. As a beginner martial artist, you can strengthen yourself. After you devour it, you can become stronger too!" Just pretend I didn't ask.The Dali King cursed in his heart!The God was extremely indifferent,'I don't even dare to think about it and only dare to curse in my heart? If celestial ruler Batian was still alive and knew that the inheritance had fallen into his hands ... It would be a disgrace! Alright, I haven't recovered yet ... The world has been silent for too many years. I'll think of a way myself! Those who wholeheartedly relied on the protection of strong people would never become strong people! If I can give it to you, I can give it to someone else. If I can give it to you, why not give it to Li Hao? If you want to fight for it, fight for it yourself!"The Dali King was shocked!If you want to fight, fight for it yourself!Jiang Li said in a hurry,"my God, we want to compete, but we're not strong enough!" In this era, the path of the beginner martial stage is a little ... A little lost. ""Then why?" the deity sighed."Li Hao was able to find the universe of the great path when he was weak, but you can 't?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe two of them were silent.Why do you keep attacking us?We're not Li Hao. If we were ... Would Li Hao still be here?Wasn't there only one Li Hao in the past hundred thousand years?"I can't help him, but I can give him some advice. If that person really has a new spirit ... He has a weakness too, and it's the bones in Jiang Li's hand ... If the bones are still useless, I once shattered his skull. That's all I have to say, you can leave!"What else could the two of them say?He could only turn around and leave.Just as they were about to leave, the God suddenly said,""We'll just ask Li Hao for help! In fact, he wants to solve the threat of the forbidden Sea even more than you. Once Ying Hongyue's refinement is successful, he will be the first one to be killed! Do you think he's really kind? You really don't care? If he can tempt you, why can't you counter him?"Two stupid guys!If Li Hao wasn't interested, why would he come here and tell you that there are benefits?"The weakness of your bones and the top of your skull are your trump cards ... Will practicing the path of beginner martial arts really make your brain stiff?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe two of them didn't dare to say anything more and quickly left.If they stayed any longer, they would be ridiculed again.This fellow ... Before he recovered, he had not spoken a word. Now that he had spoken, his words were truly vicious!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The two of them returned to the palace.Li Hao was having his meal.The divine guards were serving them food.At this moment, the divine guards were also helpless. Li Hao didn't eat much, but the dog ... Was eating so much that it made them collapse. Almost all the dishes in the palace were brought here, but they still weren't enough for the dog!The Dali King raised his eyebrows slightly but did not say anything."Marchioness Silvermoon, let's work together!" We have a way to deal with the skeleton that gave birth to the forbidden Sea ... But we need you to help us! After it's done, I want the skeleton and you can have the forbidden Sea!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao tilted his head and looked at him. He smiled."The skeleton is the core. Without the core, what do I need the ocean for?""There are treasures inside. There's definitely no lack of heavenly materials and earthly treasures like the heavenly Golden Lotus!"The king of Dali said calmly,"you can even break Ying Hongyue's hope!" Otherwise, if he really refines the forbidden Sea, do you still have the confidence to deal with him? It's a win-win cooperation. You complete your goal, and I complete mine!""That person ... Is not willing to help?""So you can only find me?" Li Hao asked curiously. ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùYou're right!But can we admit it?Jiang Li laughed."No, but my God said that we've settled the score after killing that one. Cutting his remains now ... Is not in line with the style of a beginner!" Of course, if the other party dares to enter the Li Dynasty's territory, my God will definitely kill him again!""Then let's move the forbidden Sea and enter the core of the Li Dynasty ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe two of them were speechless.We were just saying that, and you took it for real?The Dali King was helpless. He endured it and said in a low voice,""Are you willing to cooperate? It's fine if you're unwilling, but if you're willing ... If Ying Hongyue causes trouble, you'll be responsible for dealing with her. As for the skeleton, as long as you can suppress it for a moment, we'll be able to deal with it!""I don't want anything but the skeleton!"Li Hao fell into deep thought for a long time before he said,""That's fine too ... Give me half of the skeleton!""You ..."Li Hao laughed,"if you don't want to, then forget it. I still have a lot of things to do!" I'm giving you half ... Actually, it's all because of what happened last time. Otherwise ... I could've suppressed him for an instant. Is there really no way to deal with him?"The Dali King's heart moved slightly, and he gritted his teeth."Yes! How long will it take for you to mobilize your men? The one who has awakened is probably a Heavenly King as well ...""I can do it myself!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Dali King was furious,"if you want to die, do you want to drag us down with you?" If you're insincere ... Then forget it!"Li Hao laughed,"my life isn't as valuable as yours?" Forget it, if you don't believe me, I'll go and mobilize my men. I'm just afraid that the commotion will be too big and cause the other party to be on guard, as well as Ying Hongyue and Zheng Yu to be on guard ..."The Dali King frowned. He really had no way to deal with Li Hao.  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  After a while, he said,"up to you!" When do we make our move?""Three days later!""There are still some things that I haven't gotten," Li Hao said."We'll take action after I get them!"There was no need to be polite with Ying Hongyue.Three days later, he would see if he could get the Hong clan's hammer and the city Lord seal of Thunder City.As for the confidence of the king of Dali and the others ... It was nothing more than those bones. Li Hao knew that they had come for this. As for the God of beginner martial, it was very normal that he was unwilling to help.If he was really willing, he would have appeared a long time ago.It was so low-profile that it was scary!He would have to look up more information on neo martial later. Perhaps ... He could find out the other party's identity through this low-profile character."I'll come to find you three days later! King of Dali, if we succeed this time ... We should work together more in the future. I've always liked to make friends with honest people!"Li Hao laughed, stood up, and said,""You guys eat. Black Panther, martial uncle, we should go!"Then, the two people and the dog disappeared into thin air.Looking at the dishes that had been eaten clean ... The king of Dali couldn't help but curse,""If the dogs aren't eating, who's going to?"This guy was really annoying!If he didn't need his help, he would have killed him with one punch!Jiang Li sighed. The king would only dare to complain after they left.The invincible King of the past ... Was now completely suppressed by Li Hao.How sad!He thought about the God that he believed in and felt even sadder. 'Come to think of it, I've believed in him for so many years. Who is he?'

2268 Chapter 380
Li Hao continued to teleport.Hong Yitang was very puzzled. When Li Hao came out of seclusion this time, he had been running here and there. It seemed that he was only targeting Ying Hongyue. He didn't mention a word about anyone else, not even Zheng Yu.Also, the Silver Moon in the sky acted as if the other party didn't exist.Was he bent on going against Ying Hongyue?But ... He couldn't kill her. At this moment, he had spent too much energy on Ying Hongyue. Was it worth it?Why didn't Zheng Yu and the others think of a solution?There were countless thoughts in his mind, but Hong Yitang chose to remain silent.Li Hao was much more mature than before. He might not be doing useless work, but planning something.Li Hao, on the other hand, continued to shuttle back and forth.Soon, they arrived at Silver City.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Silver City.A war had broken out here before, including a battle between experts. The vast Silver City was now in ruins. This place that belonged to Li Hao's hometown was now abandoned.The seal was still visible in the air.The eight blood veins were still the same as before. One of them was still connected to Li Hao, while the remaining seven were all connected to Ying Hongyue.Hurricane city also seemed to have disappeared.Li Hao landed.The once bustling streets were now in ruins.She didn't go home to see him ... It didn't matter if she was home or not.What was home?No family, the four Seas as home!This was the nature of martial arts masters. If there was someone, they would have a home. If there was no one, they would have no home. Li Hao didn't have much nostalgia for that old house. After his parents left, he rarely went back.The grave in the Silver City was empty.Not even a corpse was left!This enmity was absolutely irreconcilable!However, Li Hao wasn't the Li Hao of the past. When he saw Ying Hongyue, he shouted to kill her. That wasn't his style. Greeting people with a smile was perhaps the best skill he had learned in the past year at the inspection Office.In the past, the stone gate under the Qiao's mine seemed to have disappeared.Perhaps Ying Hongyue had taken away the treasures or inheritance behind the door.Li Hao appeared under the seal and raised his head to look at the sky.The seal seemed to be a little weaker than before.Perhaps the struggle these days was actually destroying the seal. Perhaps Ying Hongyue herself was also extracting too much power, causing the seal to loosen.This seal ... Should have been set up by the blood Emperor in the past.The name "Zhan Tian" was still in Li Hao's mind.Li Hao raised his head and fell into deep thought. Ying Hongyue ... Zheng Yu ... Li daoheng ... Red Moon sovereign ... God of beginner martial ...Until now, none of these parties had been resolved.Either he couldn't win, or he couldn't win.Heaven and earth were still recovering rapidly. There were too many cultivators. Although the devouring of energy was also fast, the great Dao was becoming more and more consolidated as it was being swallowed and spat out. Sooner or later, this heaven and earth would be able to accommodate the Heavenly King.There was no need for any recovery ... Because it would always be recovering.Although Li Hao had slowed down the speed of his instant recovery, he had actually accelerated it. Zheng Yu stopped struggling, because he knew that no matter how much he struggled ... He might not even be able to recover as quickly as Li Hao.Initially, the second recovery would take a few years, but now, it might even exceed the level of the second recovery.Even Saints could walk out of it."Red Moon sovereign!"Li Hao's spirit had been there once, and he had seen the other party.At this moment, Li Hao's momentum was spreading along the bloody line. At this moment, a huge city silently appeared. Zheng Yu stood proudly on the top of the city, silently looking at Li Hao.Li Hao opened his eyes and calmly said, "Let's use our mental energy to check on the situation of director Zhang and the others. What are you so nervous about?"p Zheng Yu was also very calm. He shook his head."I'm not nervous. You might not be the same as you were before."Li Hao chuckled.I'm not the same person as before?Is it because ... I'm getting married, and that gave you the wrong impression?Perhaps!Zheng Yu indeed didn't seem as nervous as before. He looked at Hong Yitang and Heibao and smiled. He even took the initiative to nod at Hong Yitang.The Dao integration stage!He could tell that both of them were at the Dao integration stage.Was Lin Hongyu ... Also at the Dao integration stage?This is getting interesting!On the contrary, he was not afraid of Li Hao today.It was strange, but not strange at the same time. The carefree Li Hao was really too frightening, but with a few more people by his side, as if he had recovered from the grief of his master's death ... Zheng Yu felt that he didn't have to worry too much. Li Hao would take the initiative to break the seal!It was really complicated!But at this moment, it was indeed his true thoughts.Before Li Hao died, Hong Yitang, Lin Hongyu, and the others couldn't kill him. If they killed him, they would create another lawless Li Hao. Such a person needed to be restrained, or he would be a headache.Li Hao didn't seem to care, as if they weren't enemies. He asked curiously,""This Red Moon Emperor entered the Silver Moon all those years ago? Or is he not the only one?"Zheng Yu chuckled and said,"he's alone. After all, it's not convenient for him to bring more people!" However, the moment he entered, he must have used the Crimson Moon's power to infect many people ...""Something's wrong!" Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Li Hao shook his head."The Crimson Moon's power infected you before he entered, right?" he thought. This means that before this, someone had already mastered the power of the Crimson Moon. "If this venerable sovereign had only been infected the moment he entered, then it would not match!Zheng Yu nodded slightly."Previously, someone had mastered some power of the Crimson Moon. However ... It didn't belong to this venerable sovereign. It came from the Crimson Moon world and was brought here from the origin world for research purposes ... It was provided by the origin world for the venerable Swordmaster's research. In the end, some of it was stolen by the Li family." Some of the Li clan members have been affected by this power ... For example ... Li daoheng!"

,m "After the venerable sovereign entered, although he was quickly sealed, a lot of the power of the red moon leaked out. At that time, he was still at his peak, so some of the strong cultivators were infected, and ... They were completely infected by the other party and turned into red Moon cultivators!"He didn't mind letting Li Hao know more about venerable sovereigns. He was even more than happy to provide him with some clues."Previously, there was a group of people who wanted to Kill the Moon god in the West. It was this group of people who developed the force! They don't participate in anything else, and they only have one goal-to destroy the seal!""Then where are they hiding?" Li Hao nodded."I'm not sure. ""Perhaps ... The Hong family's main city?"Of the eight major cities, only the Hong family's main city had not appeared.Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. It was possible!Ying Hongyue was connected to the seal, but her people didn't kill her. Instead, they often helped him ... He had overlooked this point. Although he had thought about it before, he hadn't figured out the relationship between them.But now, it seemed that perhaps ... Zheng Yu was right!The Hong family's Thunder City might really have a large number of Crimson Moon experts."Is the flying sword immortal still with you?" Li Hao asked, deep in thought."Yes, you want to take it away?"Zheng Yu smiled and made a grabbing motion. The air trembled, and a female swordsman appeared in an instant. She frowned slightly and looked at Li Hao with a slightly fearful expression.Flying sword immortal!Among the three major organizations, the pavilion leader of flying Apsaras was a female assassin. She was also a swordsman and was also related to Silvermoon province. Many martial masters came from Silvermoon province.He looked very cold and seemed to be very good-looking.Unfortunately, in the eyes of Li Hao and the others, she was a real beauty!They could fabricate and change bodies as they pleased. No matter how magnificent you were, in their eyes, they didn't care about your appearance.Li Hao looked at the flying sword immortal. Could this person be Zi Yue?It was hard to say.Ying Hongyue was a crafty person. Sometimes, he would deliberately let you misunderstand him. If you were fooled, you would fall into his trap."I suspect that this person was left behind by Ying Hongyue to trick you," Li Hao said softly. "Why don't you kill him?"Hong Yitang was stunned and glanced at Li Hao.Li Hao, however, was calm."Li Hao, you're very interesting," Zheng Yu laughed. Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Li Hao sized him up and smiled.""You're also very interesting. Ying Hongyue is a Wolf, a lone wolf! From your appearance, your mannerisms, your expression, and some of your actions, I can tell that you might have a deeper level of cooperation with Ying Hongyue ... Zheng Yu, you're also interesting to dare to keep an ungrateful Wolf!"Zheng Yu chuckled and did not say anything."Can venerable sovereigns be killed?" Li Hao asked again.Zheng Yu nodded and agreed! It might have been difficult in the past, but there was hope now! The sealing of the Stargate had cut off the great Dao of origins, but at the same time, it had also cut off the great Dao of the Crimson Moon! Now, all the experts in the world were like this ... Even if a venerable sovereign's great Dao entered their body ... Without the support of the great Dao universe, they were actually like rootless floating duckweed! It has been sealed for many years and has consumed a lot of its power, so it can be killed ... The premise is that the other party is really weak to the extreme. Otherwise, even a half-step sovereign can't kill a venerable sovereign!""If it was in the past ... There would be no hope. A venerable sovereign could easily kill a half-step sovereign!"Li Hao nodded. He was indeed powerful. Half-step sovereign and venerable sovereign were only one word apart!However, their strength was like heaven and earth.At this moment, Zheng Yu said meaningfully,""If we can get the thing in Star Town City, we can kill it!"The blood Emperor's blade!Li Hao didn't say anything and ignored him. Zheng Yu looked simple and didn't seem to have a good brain, but in reality, he was a cunning old fox. Li Hao couldn't be fooled by him.Killing a few Saints ... Was actually nothing much. To Zheng Yu, they were just cannon fodder.As long as he could win in the end, it didn't matter even if the Saints and Heavenly Kings died.Li daoheng, Ying Hongyue ... Did he really not know anything about these things?That might not be the case!How come the clone he sent to star suppression city disappeared?He was easily killed by Ying Hongyue?It was hard to say whether he had taken the initiative to be killed.Strengthening the eight great families "bloodline in Ying Hongyue's body was perhaps what he was pursuing.If the Hong family's bloodline was indeed powerful, then the Zheng family's bloodline would not be weak either.
