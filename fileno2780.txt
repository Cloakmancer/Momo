It was even quieter than the Silver Moon's great Dao universe, without any light at all ... Only Mercury and Mars were flickering with light, but it was far from enough to light up the entire great Dao universe.Kong Ji also followed, and after taking a look, he felt a little emotional."So quiet ... So stingy. The master of Tian Fang took away all the power of the great DAOs. He didn't leave anything behind!"At least save some.You've taken away such a large part of the universe. Do you lack that little bit of energy?He was really stingy!As for the tiny bit of area that Li Hao had resurrected ... It couldn't be considered resurrected. Kong Ji also took a look and found that it was only a false resurrection. It was far too early for it to truly resurrect!"Then you go ahead, I'll look around!""Alright!"Li Hao nodded. Ignoring him, Kong Ji left and entered the depths of the universe of the great path.Li Hao ignored him. He quickly dragged the Silvermoon world and flew into the depths.Beside him, everyone followed him closely. At this moment, their feelings became more and more complicated.This world of destruction ... In the future, it was likely that only silver Moon would be left here.……After a while, Li Hao stopped in an area that was completely devoid of stars and DAOs.The Silvermoon world floated there like the moon, giving off a faint light.Li Hao entered the Silvermoon world in an instant. His body was so huge that it reflected the entire world. He didn't hide it and directly shouted,""The Silver Moon is weak, and chaos can not exist! I'm unable to protect all of you, and I've provoked too many powerful enemies. I've been running all the way, and today ... I no longer have the strength to protect the Silver Moon. I can only open a Stargate, seal the Silver Moon, and hide it in a secret place!" "Just like back then, maybe a thousand years have passed in Silver Moon, but I've only been away for a year ... I don't know when I'll be able to see you again! I don't know if you'll ever be able to leave the Stargate again in your lifetime ... I don't know when the Silver Moon will stand tall in the primordial chaos ... I don't know any of this!"Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell,"I can only say that if I have the strength, I will open the Silver Moon again!" The great Dao universe is still here, and the two Dao Masters will be outside. If the Dao Masters don't die, the great Dao universe still has hope of contacting the Silver Moon. If the Dao Masters die and the world is in turmoil, we can choose a new Dao master!""I will place some cultivation resources in the Silver Moon. If someone can become a venerable sovereign in the Silver Moon ... They may be able to find us through the great Dao universe ... If they are not willing, they can also stay in the Silver Moon!""Today, I will bid farewell to everyone. I don't know when I will see you again! "Perhaps, when we meet again, there will be no one in this world that I, Li Hao, am familiar with. Perhaps, a new king will be born in Silver Moon and lead it to glory ..."His voice gradually dissipated.Countless cultivators in the world froze.Some were sad, some were helpless, and some sighed.They all knew that Silvermoon had been constantly on the run.In fact, they had gathered the power of the people to strengthen the great path universe in order to face powerful enemies. However, they thought that when Marchioness Silvermoon returned, she would definitely be able to defeat all enemies.But ... Today, Marchioness Silvermoon had said that he was unable to protect Silvermoon. Even the invincible Marchioness Silvermoon would have a day where she couldn't do anything.There was frustration, helplessness, and sadness.It was more of a curtain call.Will we still be alive when we meet again?Would anyone still remember Marchioness Silvermoon in the Silvermoon world?A moment later, a loud shout rang out in an area,""We will definitely leave the Stargate, walk out of the Silver Moon, and pursue the Marquis!"It was a group of cultivators from the military, who were also Li Hao's demon-hunter guards."The Silver Moon is sealed once more. If the experts go out, they can only stay behind. However, they don't want this to happen. If the Marquis doesn't return, we'll chase after him!"Leave the Stargate again and follow the Marquis!"The shout spread and everyone's shouts could be heard everywhere.Li Hao didn't say anything in the air.He also hoped that ... Even if he was not there, someone would be able to break the Stargate. That would also mean that Silver Moon had once again accumulated some power. Even if he could not leave the Dao universe, he might still be able to find some opportunities in this Dao universe.He had built another Stargate and sealed the Silver Moon to give them more time.Otherwise, now that he was connected to the great Dao universe, these people wouldn't have any chance to fight alongside him in a short time.Without further ado, a long river appeared, and Li Hao took out the Stargate that had blocked the river. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This Stargate from neo martial was extremely powerful.After being washed by the long river, it seemed even more magical.Li Hao rose into the air and flew out of Silvermoon world.The next moment, a gate appeared and blocked the original realm gate.The power of time appeared. When a small world sealed itself, there would be a difference in the flow of time. However, the Silver Moon had just opened, so it would be difficult for it to seal itself like before.Moreover, the Silver Moon had also become a medium-level world. It was unlikely that it would be able to reach the speed of 2000 years per year.It might be 1:1000, or even less.However, one thing was for sure. The time inside the Silver Moon would flow much faster. Even if it wasn't as fast as before, it should be able to reach one year outside, but dozens of years inside.However, all the energy was no longer circulating. Simply put, he was just sitting there and eating.By the time the energy that Li Hao had put in was exhausted, there would not even be chaos energy in the vicinity. If he did not return and could not open the tianfang great Dao universe ... The Silvermoon world might self-destruct several years later.

2781 Chapter 459
Li Hao stopped thinking about this. The Stargate began to stand.The power of time sealed the Stargate.The light of the entire Silvermoon world began to fade.Gradually, the Silvermoon world became a dim star, just like the other dead stars around it.The Stargate, which had been broken with great difficulty, was once again erected today.The cultivators around Li Hao all felt uncomfortable.After a long time, on the other side of the Stargate, someone seemed to be waving. Some people outside also waved their hands gently.Tian Jian was a tough man, but he felt a little uncomfortable and waved his hand.He chose to go out, not willing to stay.Perhaps he would die soon, or perhaps he would survive, and the people inside would die one by one as time passed ... After this farewell, they didn't know when they would meet again.This departure might be an eternal farewell.Director Zhao, director Zhou, Jiang Li, Thunderbolt kick, Jade lightsaber, Huang Yu, Wang Ming, Liu Yan, Liu Long ...This group of people all chose to stay.He was too weak, and it was useless to go out.Furthermore, if they all left, the Silver Moon would be in chaos and no one would be able to manage it.Therefore, there were many people who stayed.And many people were leaving.Nanquan and the others had chosen not to stay. They still had Martial Master Silvermoon's connections and wanted to leave the martial world. However, they might not follow Li Hao. If they followed Li Hao, they wouldn't be able to participate in any battle. They could only run away with Li Hao.The Silver Moon began to float in the silent universe of the great path.Gradually, the Silver Moon drifted away.Someone in the crowd looked at Silvermoon and remained silent for a long time. Hou Xiaochen was outside, while he had left Yu Luosha behind.Her face aged. Perhaps, when they met again, Yu Luosha would have already aged and died ...However, the outside world was also a place of cannibalism.Perhaps, I would have died earlier.Hou Xiaochen looked on silently. He had already died once in Silver Moon, and he didn't want to die a second time. He wanted to come out and see if he could go any further. He didn't want others to revive him, he wanted to kill the enemy!This land of the great path, which had been silent for countless years, once again had the aura of life.A Silver World that looked like a star began to flow within the world of Nirvana.……After a while, Li Hao walked out with his men.After a while, Kong Ji walked out with a smile.""It's a pity that it's only for a short while. But it's very interesting. I didn't gain much insight from the revival, but I did gain some deeper insights into the great destruction ...""Do you need me to send them to the world of light?" he asked.There weren't many people. If it was an entire world with ten billion people, he wouldn't even speak.However, not many people came out. They could be sent to the light world, which was a level 8 world. It was huge, so it didn't lack space.Li Hao shook his head, in Tian Fang! If they don't stay in Tian Fang ... I'd rather send them to the Crimson Moon! Wherever they go ... They kill people!"Li Hao suddenly laughed and turned to look at everyone."You guys can leave! Go find your own path, go kill people, go ask questions. Silvermoon is home, but it is also a restraint. Without any restraints, I hope that you can go even further!" Nan Quan chuckled and was a little eager to try."You don't say. We were indeed lonely in Silver Moon. We had no opponents, no enemies ... We were almost crippled. Just as you said, this is a responsibility and also a restraint!"As he said this, he laughed and cupped his hands,""Silver Moon Southern Fist, I bid my farewells to all my old friends today. If you're not fated, then you'll die of old age in a foreign land, or die in battle in a foreign land!"After saying that, he turned around and left without looking back!"The heavenly Sword is one step ahead!"Tian Jian rode his sword and left without a word.Just as Southern Fist had said, if we were fated, we would meet again. If we were not, then we would never meet again.Although their home was good, it was too weak. Silver Moon had been wandering all along, and they could only stay here and guard it. Today, they had finally broken out of the cage and walked out of Silver Moon. If they had the ability, they would return."Cough, cough, cough ..."Hou Xiaochen coughed and didn't say anything. He cupped his hands to the others and left.He didn't need to say anything.They didn't act together, but went their own ways and searched for their own opportunities. If they died outside, then so be it."Just like that year, we chose a different path.Some stayed behind, some went out, and some died.However, from the Silvermoon province of the past, they had now left the Silvermoon world and entered a completely unfamiliar great world. Perhaps, there would still be people who would cross the chaos and leave.In his lifetime, even if he became a venerable sovereign, there might be a rare day.In the end, only Qian Wuliang, Heibao, and ermao were left.The venerable sovereigns didn't leave.Kong Ji turned to look at Li Hao."The Nirvana domain has been destroyed. The lightning tribulation has become stronger. Why aren't you going to undergo the Tribulation?" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao looked in the direction they left in silence for a long time.After today's farewell ... How many of these people would return?"Look at the Dao universe that automatically seals itself. The Dao universe is sealed, and if it doesn't open again ... I might not be able to see the Silver Moon in my life.I'm afraid I won't be looking for Silvermoon land before I reach the seventh step.But can I still reach the seventh step?Li Hao turned around and headed straight for the realm gate. It was better to transcend the lightning tribulation in the chaos.As for Kong Ji, he glanced at him and followed without saying a word.He had never experienced such an experience before. The great light world was too powerful. No one could force the Lord of Light to feel the same way.However, when they looked at Li Hao again, they felt that he was a little different.This guy seemed to have shed some of his hypocrisy and added a little fierceness.When this guy wasn't fierce, he killed people like they were numb.If he became fierce ... He wouldn't become a world-destroying demon, right?Of course, what does that have to do with me?Kong Ji smiled. He was only discussing Dao with Li Hao. If Li Hao didn't attack the great world of light, he didn't care who this guy killed.The chaos is so lively, isn't it better for us to join in?It was good to be lively. After being silent for a long time, it had to be revived!

Chapter 2782 Two Lunatics (1)
Chaos.The fire element exploded, burning the void.A ferocious Tiger roared and swallowed the heavens and earth.The Thunderbolt looked like a human. This time, it was even clearer. It seemed to be a person. Li Hao and Kong Ji were not surprised. Even if the Thunderbolt had turned into a human, they would not be surprised.Whether it was chaos or any other place, if such a catastrophe appeared, it would either be natural or man-made.Those who could set rules had to be in human form. This was something they all knew.The battle in the void.The battle between the destructive Thunderbolt and the fire-type Tiger.The flames erupted like a prisoner in a broken cage.Li Hao seemed to be different from before. In the past, when he faced the lightning tribulation, he would be killed and resurrected. But this time, it was different.Three deaths and three lives!He didn't want to die again. Every time he died, it seemed that his feelings for her had become weaker, and his memories had become dull. It seemed that he could let go of the people he couldn't let go of in the past.Was it the ruthlessness brought about by resurrection?Or was it because he had died so many times that he felt that he was no longer himself?Such complicated feelings, but now ... They were gradually fading.He didn't want to die anymore!This time, Li Hao went crazy and fought the chaos lightning tribulation head-on for the first time in the chaos. It was like two high-leveled venerable sovereigns were fighting in the chaotic void.Thunder, destruction, fire!"The chaos was born. All living things were destroyed. The world was not born!"In Li Hao's fierce battle, the chaos froze for a moment, as if night had fallen.Heaven and earth seemed to have been destroyed.A Daoist walked out from behind.Taking a step into the primal Chaos void, Kong Ji had a smile on his face, as though he was very interested.A giant axe that didn't match his temperament appeared in his hand. He hacked down with the axe and smiled."There are myths in the chaos. The power to split the chaos, open the universe, and let all things die!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The massive axe was also incredibly powerful, and the primal Chaos tribulation lightning seemed to have been disturbed by it.Li Hao didn't say anything and continued to attack like a trapped beast.Behind him, Kong Ji laughed again."When chaos is created, there is light!"BOOM!A light source that was like a bright sun appeared, illuminating the chaos. It was gentle and bright, without the heat of the sun, only gentle, like a breeze, brushing past."Light appears! All things are revived!"In the chaos, all living things began to recover at this moment.There was originally nothing, but suddenly, some creatures were born out of thin air ... But in the next moment, they were instantly shattered. The emptiness was somewhat awkward. Li Hao, who was fighting the Thunder, suddenly turned his head. A small blade of grass appeared on the Tiger's head.Li Hao's voice reverberated."In my Silver Moon, it's not a good thing to wear green on your head. Kong Ji, did you do it on purpose?"Kong Ji said awkwardly,"no, no. In my light, wearing green ... Is not a good thing!" However, your body seems to be full of vitality. The Dao of recovery is still a little difficult for me, so you should make do with it for now!" Resuscitation!That's right. Li Hao, who had lost some of his strength, suddenly felt a powerful energy erupting in his body. The power of the seventh step that had dissipated earlier seemed to have returned.Li Hao was shocked!Nirvana, revival!All this while, he had felt that the path of recovery was nothing special. At this moment, he knew that he had underestimated the heroes of the world.It was unbelievable!The power he had borrowed had already been lost, but at this moment, a part of it had actually returned. It was as if everything had been revived, and the energy had returned.Although the energy consumption of the void was not small, it was much more cost-effective than the energy Li Hao recovered.Even Kong Ji laughed!Li Hao seems to have underestimated me after borrowing my power. In that case, I'll show you this immature way of recovery. He has some insights, but not mature enough.Even so, Li Hao was still shocked.Li Hao was also overjoyed.""It's delicious! Nirvana revival ... The Dao of revival, I think I'm seeing something mystical!"It was unbelievable!"He's already godly?""It's better to combine resuscitation with light. I only have a rough understanding of it. The true path of resuscitation. Even if you die, I can instantly resurrect you. Power and life will return. Compared to life and death, yin and yang, I think the resuscitation of desolation is more powerful!"Were life, death, Yin, and yang very powerful?I'll let you know that you're wrong. Dao depends on people.In my eyes, the revival of destruction is stronger than life, death, Yin, and yang.Reversing yin and yang could resurrect?What was this!"All living things will be destroyed. As long as there is a trace of existence, it is not considered death. As long as it is destroyed, I can resurrect you. Even if it is only a drop of blood, I can resurrect you to your strongest state."This was a revival!​ Of course, he felt that the Nirvana recovery was even more powerful when combined with the Samsara of life and death.The cycle of life and death might not be able to instantly return to the peak.If you die, we'll walk the path of life and death.If you're not dead, I'll let you go through Nirvana revival.Li Hao laughed heartily. At this moment, he slashed out with his sword. The power of fire burned the lightning, and the lightning giant began to roar. BOOM! Everything was destroyed, and everything was destroyed again.At this moment, the destructive power suddenly roiled and the power of Nirvana spread.Kong Ji attacked from a distance. With a point of his finger, everything was destroyed, including the chaos lightning tribulation. Li Hao's fire-elemental sword attack scattered half of the lightning.Outsiders were not allowed to help transcend the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.However, Nirvana revival also seemed to be within the scope of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.This kind of heaven-defying Dao seemed to be rejected by the chaos.

Chapter 2783 Two Lunatics (2)
A simple Nirvana would not be like this.However, when it came to recovery, the lightning tribulation seemed to have the intention of killing Kong Jue.After all, Kong Ji was only at the fifth step. After his attack succeeded, he quickly retreated.An axe once again slashed across the void.The void energy was also being used up. At this moment, he laughed,""I'll show you something even more powerful! What is ... Nirvana!"With a low roar, the chaos in front of him instantly began to turn into emptiness.It was silent!Everything began to die down. Li Hao's fire element was somewhat withered, and so was his lightning.Kong Ji's face was pale.He was smiling brightly.Previously, in the Dao chess, he had comprehended many things. After entering the Dao universe, he had comprehended some more things. He had just advanced to level five not long ago, but he felt that he was close to level six. Perhaps he would be able to enter level six soon!From there, he would surpass his strength 500 years ago, before he switched to the great Dao.It was too fast!Of course, this was related to the fact that he had entered Tier 5 twice. There was also one more thing ... He did not lack energy. He had plenty of great Dao crystals. He was a typical rich second generation. Although he had left the divine light plane, it did not mean that he had betrayed the divine light plane.He had a father who was at the eighth rank!Although his father was very unhappy with him for not following the routine ... His son had walked his own path, and his father was an eighth-level, so he had good taste. He was also very pleased, so even though his son had left home, he still arranged for a fifth-level bodyguard.p A fifth stage venerable sovereign was not a weakling.As for the resources ... He would have enough.Even if rank seven venerable sovereigns did not cultivate, he had to satisfy his son's cultivation first.Li Hao was a grassroots, but he wasn 't.Li Hao needed to kill people to obtain energy, but he didn 't.If it really didn't work, his father could seclude himself in the chaos for thousands or tens of thousands of years and absorb great Dao crystals for him to cultivate.At this moment, the Dao of Nirvana radiated in all directions.It was extremely terrifying!Li Hao even felt a little dizzy. However, he was stronger than his opponent at the moment, after all, so he broke free in an instant. However, he had consumed a lot of energy. The same was true for the figure of tribulation lightning. It consumed some energy in an instant and broke free.The two sides once again fought fiercely.Both the lightning tribulation and Li Hao were consumables.It all depended on who exhausted who first!The shockwaves of the battle didn't spread out. Instead, they were destroyed by the Nirvana domain. This was the power of the desolation domain. It could suppress an earth-shaking battle to a small area.At this moment, the void was exhausted and somewhat powerless.Li Hao was already very satisfied.Cool!Previously, he had almost lost. With Kong Ji's help, he was now on par with the lightning tribulation. If this continued, he might not die again. He didn't want to experience death again. At this moment, Kong Ji saw that the man and the lightning were still tied.He sighed. In the next moment, his energy, which had almost been completely depleted, was suddenly restored.Even Li Hao was shocked!A light sphere the size of a human head was absorbed by Kong Ji. Seeing Li Hao look at him, Kong Ji smiled."Stop looking at it. It's called the origin of light. It's a treasure born in the origin of the great Dao of light in the universe. It grows once every 100000 years ... What my father gave me is only a fifth level venerable sovereign to me. It can instantly restore all the power of the great Dao!"è‰¹!Li Hao almost cursed.They were so envious, jealous, and hateful!Was this the second generation?I want to be like this too!"Don't look at it. You're not a light path cultivator, so it'll be a waste even if you use it. I am ... Although I'm not now! However, I was born in the light universe. Also, this thing is useful for intermediate-level beings. You're considered an advanced-level being now. "After saying that, Kong Ji laughed again,"watch me!""All living things are revived!"BOOM!On Li Hao's tiger head, another blade of grass grew. This blade of grass instantly produced a large amount of energy, which turned into a light source and entered Li Hao's body. Li Hao's energy was restored once again.The void was empty again!A rank five venerable sovereign had used up all his energy in an instant. It was clear how terrifying this revival was.Kong Ji staggered and laughed."Not bad. I was able to resurrect a rank seven venerable sovereign at once ... Even if it's a fake rank seven, it's still not bad!"However, he and Li Hao did not say much about the source of light.An eighth-tier great cosmos would produce one every 100000 years.Even the Lord God of light, who had been in charge of the light universe for more than a million years, might only have ten. It was impossible for him to not use any, and it was also impossible for him to keep all of them for himself. Some of the high-level venerable sovereigns in the light universe had to have a share.After a million years, it would be good if the other party kept three.But this time, he had used one.This was a true life-saving treasure! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  A level five venerable sovereign could instantly replenish all his energy. One could only imagine how precious this item was. It was enough for some level six venerable sovereigns to fight over it.Even a level Seven venerable sovereign would not be underestimated.But now, it had been consumed, which only replenished Li Hao's energy. Li Hao had now officially gained the upper hand in his first battle with the chaos lightning tribulation.The last time was when he had passed the life and death tribulation to become a venerable sovereign. However, the lightning tribulation was very weak at that time and only had the power of a first or second stage venerable sovereign. This time, it was the power of a seventh stage venerable sovereign.Many of the lightning figures were scattered by Li Hao's sword.The long river appeared and swept across.A large amount of destructive power was swept away by Li Hao.This time, Li Hao began to gain the upper hand, suppressing and crushing the lightning tribulation.

Chapter 2784 Two Lunatics (3)
After more than ten minutes, Li Hao completely shattered the figure with a loud boom!"Hu!"Li Hao heaved a long sigh. Like a sharp sword, he pierced through the chaos.He turned his head to look at Kong Ji and recovered from his Tiger form. He cupped his hands and said,"thank you!""You're welcome!"As if nothing had happened, Kong Ji sized Li Hao up and smiled."Looks like I don't have to die this time."He had also seen Li Hao reverse life and death.He was the one who had suggested the idea of nine times.He also knew that Li Hao had died three times. It was said that when he killed people before, he also underwent a lightning tribulation. In Li Hao's case, each time he was killed, it was not as bad as the lightning tribulation. It was normal for him to be struck to death by lightning.Three deaths ... Li Hao was only at the 3rd rank. If this continued, who knew how many more deaths he would have to face?This time, he didn't have to die.Li Hao nodded."I didn't expect that you could really recover a lot of my exhausted power. Even now, I still have some power at the seventh step in my body. It's a pity that I don't have a single person at the sixth step to kill. It's a bit of a waste." This power would dissipate very quickly.If there was a stage six right now, without the threat of the Tribulation lightning, Li Hao might be able to kill one if he exhausted all his strength ... But now, he might run out of energy in a few minutes, and he wouldn't be able to capture him.What a waste!Moreover, with the help of the void, Li Hao felt very relaxed when he transcended the Tribulation this time. Although he had fought a fierce battle, he only felt refreshed and did not feel that he had been suppressed to the point of collapse.His heart was filled with emotions.It had been a long time since he had felt this way.This was because he was too strong, so strong that the Silvermoon Warriors could not help him. However, although lonely void was only at the fifth step, he had been of great help at this critical moment.Li Hao's mood was much better after he shattered the lightning.He had broken away from the reluctance to part."Don't waste it!"Kong Ji laughed. At this moment, his laughter was a little cunning, not as pure as before."What do you mean?"Li Hao looked at him. He couldn't maintain this power for long and it would soon dissipate.To kill other venerable sovereigns?Other than the venerable sovereigns of Hui long temple, he had no interest in killing people everywhere.Of course, the forces of the floating light region had also participated in the siege of neo martial. However, they were quite far away. Even at this moment, by the time he arrived there, he might have already exhausted all of his energy.There was no one worth killing in the Dragon field. "Let's go to the dark Demon Palace and spar with that senior Artifact Spirit!"Kong Ji's smile was a little strange,"that senior is very interesting!" If it really doesn't work, I'll give this power to the other party and let him revive the dark Demon Ridge. I'll see if I can pass the first level. After finishing it ... I'll try to comprehend the Dao of chess normally, and there's still an opportunity. "Li Hao was stunned for a moment, then smiled.""Good idea, not a waste! "I almost forgot. That's right. If the other party is the weapon spirit of the Dao chess piece, the weapon of the master of tianfang is suitable for the power of tianfang! The power in my body is the power of tianfang. It's good to let him recover the dark Demon Ridge ..."As for sparring, forget it.It didn't make much sense.Even if he killed the opponent and seized the chess piece, he might not be able to open it.However, giving this power to the other party ... Seemed like a good idea. The dark Demon Ridge had been revived, and the first stage of the dark Demon Hall could be opened. Kong Ji could also walk through the first stage normally.In addition ... This can be considered as the other party owing me a favor, right?'I owe a bunch of them ... Let them owe me once, and I owe Daoist Huo Yan. Then, I'll borrow his power and make the mysterious man owe me another one ... It won't be too bad.'Good idea!At this moment, even Li Hao laughed."Fellow Daoist Kong Ji, you're really plucking the feathers of a goose when it passes by. You're even more calculative than I am. You're from such a wealthy family, but you're still so ... Not easy."Kong Ji laughed,"that's not true!" You have money and power, but that's also from your little savings. You shouldn't hate the rich, that's not good! When I was in the divine light plane, I wouldn't waste it. ""I don't hate the rich ... I'm just envious!"Li Hao laughed.The two of them headed straight back to the Dragon field. "What's there to be envious of? Outsiders say they're envious, but when you're in their shoes, you might not be envious anymore. ""Nonsense!""Then should we change our identities?" Li Hao joked."My father must be willing to change his son!""Hahaha!"Li Hao laughed.Kong Ji seemed to be in a good mood as well. The two of them quickly headed straight for the dark Demon Ridge. Kong Ji said,""If Huilong and the others come back, do you still want to borrow their strength to kill them? Killing a returning Dragon didn't mean much! Moreover, Yunxiao may have a high-level venerable sovereign coming over. Even if you borrow the power of a seventh-rank venerable sovereign ... You may not be able to kill them. Instead, you will put yourself in a desperate situation!"Li Hao said,'my idea is that if Hui long and the others return first, I'll lure them into Silvermoon's great Dao universe and kill them all! Of course, this doesn't include Level Seven venerable sovereigns. This way, my Silvermoon great Dao universe will not lack energy to advance. ""In addition, after killing these guys, I'll escape Tian Fang and use the power of the Dao chess to return to Tian Fang ... They won't be able to find me at all.""This is inappropriate!"But Kong Ji shook his head. Li Hao was a little surprised.For a long time, no one would say that he had done something wrong. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "You're underestimating advanced venerable sovereigns!"Kong Ji quickly replied,'a high level venerable sovereign will probably arrive faster than Hui long and the others! "The opponent's speed is not something a rank six venerable sovereign can compare to. You're only a fake rank seven. You should have felt it. A real rank seven is even faster! Therefore, the first one to come would definitely be the rank seven venerable sovereign. There were four rank seven and one rank eight in the cloud world. This time, it would most likely be venerable sovereign Wu Shan! This person is good at seeing through the clouds and fog, and can see the truth in the chaos. He's a very terrifying guy. "

"Therefore, your goal of killing Hui long and the others will be very difficult to achieve!"Li Hao was deep in thought."There's one more thing," Kong Ji continued."Be careful that they might find out where your great Dao universe is ... They're not itinerant cultivators. They're true Level Seven venerable sovereigns from great worlds. They're more familiar with the great Dao universe than you and I are! Do you really think that they can't tell?"Li Hao frowned slightly.He still didn't know enough about advanced venerable sovereigns.If what Kong Ji said was true, once the other party came first, even if he borrowed power and used the Dao universe to disguise himself ... He would still be discovered by the other party in the end, and he might even lose Silvermoon's Dao universe.That would be a sin!He had destroyed Silvermoon's hope ... Even though there was still a great Dao universe.But the dual Dao universe might become a single Dao universe."Then what does fellow Daoist mean?"Kong Ji laughed."Avoid a head-on collision with a rank seven venerable sovereign. Otherwise, you'll be the one to die. Rank seven is beyond what you and I can handle now!""Your goal is actually very simple ... Temporarily avoid the vision of the Crimson Moon and the clouds and disappear into the vast universe. You want to return to the Dao chess to comprehend the great Dao and observe the changes in the situation!"Li Hao nodded. This was his goal.However, it would be difficult to achieve this goal.At this moment, he could hide in the chess piece, but ... If he disappeared in Tian Fang, it would definitely attract the attention of the strong people and they would search for him in Tian Fang.It would be best if he disappeared from the universe in front of the powerhouses.He had originally thought that Huilong and the others were not far away and had only traveled for ten days. If they sped up, they should arrive earlier. After he killed Huilong and the others, Yunxiao's level Seven venerable sovereign would probably arrive. As for him, he would escape before they arrived and disappear without a trace ... In this way, he, Li Hao, would be a missing person in the chaos.He had also made some predictions. Supreme Emperor Hui long and the others had only left for more than ten days. If they sped up, they might be back in five or six days.As for the cloud world, it was quite far away from here. It was normal for it to take a month.Even if the seventh-rank was faster, it was normal to take half a month.But from what Kong Ji said, the other party didn't need that long.What Kong Ji said must be right. The other party was the son of a rank 8. There was no difference between a rank 7 and a rank 8 in the great world of light. Kong Ji must know more than him.Seeing Li Hao nod, Kong Ji knew that he had guessed right. He said,""You're not wrong, but you've underestimated the power of a rank seven venerable sovereign ... You can't do that! Moreover, he escaped in front of a rank seven venerable sovereign ... The other party is not stupid. He might be able to guess something!" He continued,"my thoughts are the opposite of yours. You can't just sit here and wait for death. You killed Yunxiao's expert, and you're actually waiting for him to come here ... Isn't there a problem?" What you need to do now is ... Take advantage of the fact that they haven't come and quickly escape Tian Fang. Let them chase after you ... Think of a way to meet Huilong and the others and kill them on the way!""Kill a few of them and continue to run ... Run all the way under the eyes of a Tier 6 martial artist! Leave some survivors to witness your escape and prove that you have really escaped. This is the key to why the rank seven venerable sovereign believed that you have escaped!"Li Hao pondered."However, I can't borrow too much power in the chaos ... Of course, I can still borrow some power of the sixth step after killing Chi Yun."Thinking of this, he nodded his head and said,"that sounds good!"The sudden burst of a sixth step power could even kill some weaklings.The lightning tribulation wouldn't be too strong, so he should be able to withstand it.This might be safer.As for the great Dao universe's disguise ... According to Kong Ji, there was no need for that. The real tianfang universe had really appeared. The disguise would easily be superfluous, and a level Seven venerable sovereign would be able to see through it.Today, everyone in tianfang world had seen the appearance of tianfang universe.This was the best proof!There was no need for Li Hao to disguise himself.Kong Ji saw that he was deep in thought and didn't disturb him. After a while, when they were almost at the dark Demon Ridge, he said,""What you're thinking now is ... To continue participating in the battle of the major worlds, right?" Li Hao nodded."That's right. Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked Silver Moon to hide!" He had asked Silver Moon to hide himself so that he could participate in all of this! But now, I'm still waiting to comprehend the ultimate Yin Dao. With the fusion of yin and yang, I should be able to step into the intermediate stage, and then have more capital to participate in this war!""The revival of the dead is not necessarily worse than that of yin and yang!"Kong Ji laughed."Although you can't reach tier 7, I'll give you some pointers now. You can still comprehend the simple Nirvana recovery. You can't reach tier 7, but it's not difficult to reach Tier 4! Must it be yin and yang?" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "If you really can't do it, I know light and dark very well. You can try it too. Even if it didn't work, the five-element technique was still considered average! Li Hao, it's not that the neo martial artist human King is strong, but that yin and yang are strong. If you pursue yin and yang wholeheartedly, it won't be easy for you to get them. ""Furthermore, the revival of destruction is more compatible with life and death!""As you can see," he said,"Nirvana and death, revival and reincarnation, they are actually a kind of Dao that complement each other."Li Hao was startled."I've thought about it. It's just that ... You haven't even realized how to resuscitate ..."Of course, that was in the past. But now, it seemed that the other party had comprehended some ways of recovery. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to recover.But ..."I'll teach you Nirvana revival, and you'll teach me life and death. How about it?"

Chapter 2786 Two Lunatics (3)_5
Li Hao was startled. It wasn't that he didn't want to teach her, but ... He hesitated for a moment before saying,""It's not that I don't want to teach you life and death, but the Dao of life and death requires you to truly experience life and death! Unless there's no other choice ... Under normal circumstances, the Dao of life and death is actually learned by the grassroots. Yin Yang, Nirvana, and resurrection are all learned by people who can't die. The grassroots have no choice but to gamble their lives!" You don't need to gamble your life!Both he and Lin Hongyu had gambled their lives many times. Li Hao had really died a few times, and Lin Hongyu had summoned her future self, which, by coincidence, possessed the power of death.Life was easy, but death was hard.Kong Ji laughed,"this is nothing!" I'll learn it first and know some things. When I really encounter a life and death crisis one day, I'll take a gamble! Who dared to say that hun Dun would not die? Not to mention me, do the Masters of the major worlds, the Master of Darkness, and the master of bliss believe that I will die? He still died! This thing will be very useful in critical moments. ""As for the Dao of yin and yang ... You may have let people come into contact with neo martial arts, but to be honest, in neo martial arts, in my opinion, there are only two people who really understand yin and yang. One is the neo martial human King and the other is Emperor Cang. The others don't understand it at all!""The things that I've comprehended might not be that effective."The Dao of Nirvana and the Dao of revival were indeed not bad.In fact, Li Hao had also gained some insight into the Dao of Nirvana.And resuscitation ... The cycle of life and death could perhaps be considered a type of resuscitation. Today, he had personally experienced the resurrection of power. If Li Hao really wanted to learn, he might be able to learn a little.It sounded like a good idea.However, he had always set yin and yang as his goal ... This was the first reason. The second reason was to reverse yin and yang to resurrect powerful experts. From the looks of it now, it seemed to be somewhat similar to the resurrection of Nirvana ... This was also what Li Hao had been pursuing.If it was light or dark, Li Hao might not have considered it.However, the revival of the dead was something worth considering.The key was that the void was here.Easy to obtain!Li Hao had never seen the reversal of yin and yang, but he had seen the Dao of destruction and revival many times. Thinking of this, Li Hao thought carefully and said after a moment of silence,""I can pass on the Enlightenment of life and death to you, and you can pass on the Dao of Nirvana and resurrection to me. However, I have to make one thing clear. If you really bet on resurrection when you die ... I won't be responsible for your death!"Luck played a part in this.What if he bet that ... He couldn't revive?I won't care about that!Kong Ji laughed."You make it sound like I'm going to die. Besides, even if I can't be revived, it's because I don't have enough enlightenment. What does it have to do with you?" What I've taught you is only the tip of the iceberg. I'm not saying that I'm really proficient in the way of recovery. Otherwise, I would have entered the seventh rank long ago!"They were all superficial, and everyone was about the same. Who said that one was inferior to the other?It was almost the same anyway."Then I'm being calculative."Li Hao sighed."When I'm with a second-generation heir like you, you might be too generous, but I'll find that I'm not. The life of a poor man. If I have children in the future, I'll let my descendants be rich and be more generous from a young age."“……”Kong Ji chuckled. He suddenly felt that Li Hao was quite interesting, not the kind of interesting on the road. Usually, this guy would be quite interesting unless he had a deep hatred for someone. Unfortunately, he didn't have time to entertain him.As the two of them conversed, they had already entered the dark Demon Ridge. Soon, the two of them appeared in the dark Demon Palace.The mysterious man was slightly surprised.Li Hao didn't say anything. He poured all of his fire-elemental power into the hall and into the shadow. The shadow was stunned.艹!Why?Li Hao smiled."Senior, this is the heaven's path power that I've absorbed. It's to replenish your energy!"“……”The shadow was speechless."I'm not looking for anything in return!"Li Hao said.“……”If you say this, it means you're scheming!You've borrowed the power of fire and left the rest to me, and then ... I still owe you?"I don't need it!"The mysterious man's voice was calm,"it doesn't matter even if I don't have energy!" It's none of my business, you blended in yourself!"I'm not taking this!Li Hao smiled."It's okay ... I'll just be more integrated. Senior, I have a small request. It's very easy to satisfy.""Speak," he said."If I were to use the imprint to escape ... Cough, cough, if I were to come here to comprehend the Dao, can I bring a few people with me? Of course, they don't participate in the Enlightenment, so they stay in the Dao chess. "“……”You really think this is a sanctuary?It was just that the other party had provided him with a pile of energy, and the power of heaven was indeed what the illusory figure needed.Although Li Hao had integrated into it on his own, and he didn't want this favor, he still had to accept it.However ... They had already melted him down, and their request wasn't too outrageous. They had only brought along a few people to take refuge with them. One more or one less wouldn't make a difference.After thinking for a while, the mysterious man said,"yes ... But as you said, if they don't have the qualifications, they can't participate in the Enlightenment of Dao chess!" It's easy for all of you to enter the Dao chess game, but it doesn't mean that everyone is qualified to participate ... Besides, it might not be a good thing to participate. Not everyone wants to comprehend thousands of Daoist techniques. If you comprehend too much, you might even cause them some trouble. " p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It was not necessarily a good thing to be too knowledgeable.Everyone had gone to pursue the fusion of the ten thousand DAOs ... If it was that simple, there would be advanced venerable sovereigns everywhere in the world.Some people were not suitable to have too much experience.

Chapter 2787 Two Lunatics (2 In 1)
Perhaps it would be better if he was one-track minded."You want him to comprehend the myriad DAOs ... To him, it might be a form of torture. He's seen too much and feels that he's wrong. He's starting to doubt himself and insists on learning from the master of Tian Fang. He's done for. Even if he had the chance to become stronger, he lost it. Dao chess was only for those who were fated to see it. It was not for self-preservation. It was for the right person to see it.Li Hao nodded."That's enough. I just need a place to take refuge. I won't be staying here for long. I don't have many people with me now!""That's fine!"After saying that, the mysterious man continued,'you're quite capable to be able to retain so much energy! It looks like it's going smoothly, but you've been borrowing strength ...""I'm fine!"Li Hao smiled.Seeing that Li Hao didn't seem to care, the mysterious man frowned. Li Hao didn't see it, but he sensed it.Li Hao smiled,"I know where the problem lies!" However, since it had already come to this, there was no point in thinking about it every day. He would just borrow less in the future! If it really doesn't work ... I'll think of a way to make up for it!"Make up?How could it be that simple!The shadow didn't say anything more, it was just a reminder.As for Li Hao's choice, the mysterious man didn't care.The mysterious man didn't say anything.At this moment, Kong Ji suddenly said,"senior, I've absorbed some energy. Does this mean that the dark Demon Ridge can function again?" Can I try the first test that senior mentioned before?"F * ck!Was he waiting here?I was thinking!The mysterious man was speechless.However, the dark Demon Ridge was the territory of the dark emissaries. The dark emissaries had set up the first level, and if he passed it, he could come to the second level. The other party had not passed it before, but not passing it once did not mean that he could not try again. If he passed it ... He did not have any reason to refuse him from comprehending the Dao chess again.In addition, it was also the master of tianfang's intention to let these talented guys come into contact with Dao chess.The mysterious man was speechless. After a long while, he said,"of course you can, but wait. You've consumed too much energy recently. Be it the Dao chess game or the dark Devil Ridge, they're all consuming energy. The energy absorbed previously was very little and was almost depleted by you. Therefore, this is also why I need you to provide me with energy to enter the Dao chess game." p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "No hurry!" Kong Ji laughed.He was not in a hurry.At this moment, he looked at Li Hao."Since you're already here, let's have a spar and talk about the solution to the great Dao. When we're done, you can leave as soon as possible. I'll continue my seclusion ... I'll just pretend that I've never come out. If Yunxiao's venerable sovereign comes, I'll say the same thing. As for you ... You should run away as soon as possible!"Li Hao chuckled.Why are you in such a hurry to chase me away?Of course, according to what they had said before, it might be better for them to leave earlier. Otherwise, that seventh level venerable sovereign could rush over at any time.It's just that I've finally come to tianfang, and I have to run away before I even see the return Dragon?In addition, there are still many Silver Moon people in Tian Fang.He had left his teachers and the rest here.However, it might be safer here. Who would care about it if they were below venerable sovereigns?No one would care!Li Hao didn't plan to take his teachers and the others with him. They would find their own opportunities. Tian Fang had many opportunities, and some places with Taoist connotation also depended on their luck.With a thought, Li Hao nodded."Alright, let's have an exchange. I hope you can reach level six as soon as possible, fellow Daoist. I hope I can reach level four as soon as possible!" The war in the Crimson Moon region will break out sooner or later ... I think the same is true for the heavenly square region. The divine light plane may not always be safe. Yunxiao seems to be quite ambitious ..."Kong Ji nodded. This was true.The light and the clouds had been entangled for many years.Now that the nearby Hongyue region was at war, this side was also restless because Hongyue was restrained by new martial arts. Previously, when the two sides were at war, the nearest Hongyue might become a hindrance.Now, there were fewer constraints.As for the West and East, they were further away and had less contact with Tian Fang and the Crimson Moon.The two of them didn't say much and didn't care about the occasion.After sitting down, the two of them began to communicate.The communication between them was no longer just words.It was a Daoist technique!The river of life and death was directly opened, and the other party also displayed his Nirvana domain, directly switching positions. Li Hao entered the Nirvana domain, and Kong Ji entered the river of life and death. The two sides exchanged control.Kong Ji would control the river of life and death and the stars of Life and death, while Li Hao would control the Nirvana realm.Such an exchange of mantras was more efficient and direct.More importantly, even the virtual shadow was left speechless. 'F * ck, these two lunatics!How could they exchange mantras like this?Was this still considered an exchange?This was considered dual cultivation!You know me, I know you. You pry into the essence of my mantras, I pry into the core of yours ... These two lunatics, have they never thought that once they fall out, wouldn't their trump cards be exposed?It was indeed fast, but ... What was the use of being fast? it was more important to leave some trump cards for himself.In the next moment, the shadow shook again.This was because ... Under the curiosity of the void, a special star had been formed in the river of life and death ... Time!Li Hao didn't want to fall behind. In the next moment, all living things in the Nirvana realm began to revive, and many plants even grew. A moment later, Li Hao even crazily gave these creatures some vitality!Then, the shadow knew that he was in trouble.Sure enough!In the blink of an eye, a dark cloud appeared above each of their heads and instantly merged together. Fortunately, it was not too strong.Then, the two lunatics each controlled a Dao domain they were not familiar with to face the chaos lightning tribulation.This was perhaps the most outrageous thing the mysterious figure had ever seen in his life!It had never been so ridiculous!These two lunatics seemed to want to torture each other to death. One wished to destroy Li Hao's River of Life and death, while the other wished to completely destroy the Nirvana domain. In any case, they could do whatever they wanted!This happened three times, and Li Hao's life and death were greatly shortened.A large piece of the empty Nirvana domain shattered.Then, the two of them switched back.Then, under the shadow's dumbfounded gaze, Li Hao waved his hand as a farewell. Kong Ji sat down cross-legged and repaired the Nirvana domain. He waved his hand, indicating that he understood.After that ... The two of them went their separate ways. One of them was going to continue fleeing, while the other was going into closed-door cultivation.After Li Hao left, the mysterious man couldn't help but ask,""Little friend Kong Ji, have you considered what would happen if the two of you were to fall out in the future?"Kong Ji was a little surprised. After a while, he said, "I'm only at the fifth step, and he's only at the third step. Today's comprehension is only a small part of the great path for us. Even if we know each other's roots, don't tell me that we can't improve further? Whose Dao will be the same?"This chess spirit was knowledgeable, had a true body of an eighth-tier great universe, and was a ninth-tier venerable sovereign weapon ... How could he ask such a question?I'm only at the fifth step, is it that hard for me to reach the seventh step?Li Hao was only at the third step. Was the seventh step that far away?What we know now is only the third-rank Li Hao and the fifth-rank Kong Ji. Do you think that after you know the situation of the third-rank Li Hao and fall out with him at the seventh-rank, he will still have a third-rank Tao technique comprehension?It was ridiculous!He looked at the shadow. At that moment, he was a little suspicious. Was this guy the artifact Spirit of the Dao chess? why did it feel like ... He didn't really understand the great Dao?The shadow was speechless!He cursed in his heart!è‰¹!Are you crazy?Who would think that?When one became a venerable sovereign, wouldn't the foundation of the great Dao be successfully laid?So, you're saying that death, revival, and life and death will not be your end, but only the beginning, right?I understand that Li Hao is Shi Guang.What are you pursuing?Where did you get the confidence to compare yourself to time in the future?Of course, the prerequisite was that Li Hao had to master the art of time. Otherwise, life and death were also his Foundation.As for Kong Ji, he no longer paid any attention to the illusory figure. There was nothing much to talk about with a weapon spirit. No one stipulated that one had to cultivate a special Dao in the Dao of cultivation. It had to be special to the extreme. In the end, all DAOs and skills had to be integrated.Any Dao art of the extreme could easily crush your time.Li Haoming didn't understand. He didn't know.Anyway, that was what he was thinking.Nirvana and revival are just a trial on my path forward. Who says that I'll definitely cultivate to Nirvana and revival in the end?I also cultivate light and darkness, life and death, the five elements, destruction and creation.

2788 Chapter 461
Tian Fang.Near the realm gate.Li Hao stood still. At this moment, only Qian Wuliang and black Panther were beside him. Second cat had entered the river of life and death and started its long sleep.Li Hao had been standing there.Qian Wuliang was confused, wondering what the Marquis was thinking about.Didn't he say he was leaving?Why were they still here? he had heard Kong Ji's words. If they didn't leave now, the rank seven venerable sovereigns of the cloud world might come. In that case, they had to run.His goal in coming to tianfang was to attract the attention of the great worlds and draw out the great Dao universe. If there was no great Dao universe, he would forge it ... Now that tianfang's great Dao universe had come out on its own, although it had not recovered, his goal was almost achieved.Now that the attention of the cloud world had been focused on him, venerable Dragon Emperor and the others should return as well ... His goal was almost achieved.Of course, he didn't know what was going on with the red moon.He didn't know if they would insist on dealing with neo martial.This was also what Li Hao was thinking about.Kong Ji was actually right, but there was something wrong. Tian Fang's universe of the great path had only appeared, but it did not show any signs of recovery. In this case, there were many Red Moon Supreme emperors, and a strong person like red Moon master might not pay attention to this moment and put his attention on Tian Fang."Kong Ji still thinks too simply."Qian Wuliang didn't say anything after hearing his murmuring.Li Hao said softly,"based on the current situation in Tian Fang, Red Moon won't ignore neo martial. Instead, she will focus her energy on Tian Fang. The movement of Tian Fang's recovery is too small!"Qian Wuliang felt a bit uneasy.Li Hao considered for a while, then said,""The great path universe of a level-nine great world is about to recover. Who would believe such a small commotion? Even if we see it, everyone will think that it might take a long time for it to recover!"Qian Wuliang nodded slightly."If I want to attract the red moon to give up on neo martial and focus on this side ... I have to make the red moon Lord think that the ninth-grade opportunity is here!"Qian Wuliang frowned and said,"Lord Marquis, this is too difficult." The tianfang great Dao universe has indeed been destroyed. To create a huge commotion ... The power of Level Seven previously only slightly attracted the appearance of the great Dao universe. Now, it has disappeared. "Even silver Moon had disappeared.There was no big movement, only a big opportunity.It was too difficult to attract the attention of a level eight venerable sovereign.Yunxiao would probably not care about venerable the sword for the time being, because they had lost a sixth level venerable sovereign here. Not only that, Yunxiao had been planning for the tianfang world for a long time, and tianfang was the place they paid more attention to.That was why the cloud world would give up on hunting venerable the sword. However, in the red moon world, unless there was a possibility of a rank nine opportunity, it would be difficult for the red moon Lord to give up on hunting neo martial artists.Li Hao turned his head and glanced at the Outlander world."Qian Wuliang, what do you think about ... Making some noise before we leave?" he laughed after a while.What's the commotion?Qian Wuliang was a bit nervous. Please don 't! It was too dangerous!He couldn't use this thing again."I just infused a lot of energy, seventh-stage energy, into an eighth-stage or even ninth-stage sovereign weapon ..." Li Hao said.Qian Wuliang seemed to have understood what Li Hao meant.Li Hao pondered for a while and decided that he had to do it since he was here.Although at this moment ... He might attract Hong Yue's attention, it was not enough.It wasn't stable!He had to create a bigger commotion.Li Hao made a judgment and said again,""Form a universe called the bed outside, temporarily covering an area of tianfang. I'll summon a monarch weapon that will show the pressure of a top-tier venerable sovereign, called the bed pressure, and ten thousand phantoms ..."At this moment, the corpses of venerable sovereigns appeared one after another. Other than the corpse of venerable sovereign Chi Yun, the venerable sovereigns of the returning Dragon Temple that he had killed were all here.Li Hao took a look. This many might not be enough.Kong Ji asked him to leave, but Li Hao's purpose in coming here was to kill a level six venerable sovereign, so it was meaningless."How can the revival of the great Dao ... Be completely useless! Let the energy of the 16 venerable sovereigns and the power of their great DAOs spread into tianfang world, letting everyone feel the increase in the power of their great DAOs. What do you think?""Marquis, is it worth it?" Qian Wuliang asked with a pained expression.He understood.Li Hao might have to pay a huge price to create the illusion that the great DAOs had truly recovered. Sixteen venerable sovereigns!Isn't it good to let me absorb it?The Dao universe also needed it.Li Hao's intention was clear. He wanted to spread the energy and power of the great DAOs of the 16 venerable sovereigns into the heaven. At that time, who would dare to doubt that the great Dao universe had not recovered?Even if it had not fully recovered, it must have been partially activated.That was the power of 16 venerable sovereigns!"Do you think ... That everyone will believe you?" Li Hao continued.Qian Wuliang nodded with a pained expression.Because normal people ... Really wouldn't do such a thing. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao said,"let's take a little more risk ... The power of the great Dao of the venerable sovereigns is not pure. It contains a lot of chaos power ... Qian Wuliang, you can absorb it first, purify it, and then release it. Then, you can show the Silver Moon great Dao. Some people will feel as if they are in a universe of great Dao and can comprehend the real great Dao. What do you think?"“……”Qian Wuliang swallowed his saliva and said carefully,""Lord Marquis, Tian Fang ... And many other venerable sovereigns, including a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns!"

2789 Chapter 461
He could only hope that this person would not be so crazy.With this, if one of the venerable sovereigns really sensed something and came to kill him, he, a second level venerable sovereign, would not be able to resist it. Not only would it be exposed, but the great Dao universe might also be taken away.Also, it was very dangerous for venerable sovereigns to comprehend their own great Dao.Li Hao nodded."I know, but this time, the main disturbance is in the Hui long field, which doesn't have any venerable sovereigns now ... It's your chance. It'll mainly cover the Hui long field and the nearby fields, including some venerable sovereigns. Low-stage venerable sovereigns won't notice anything, but if there are mid-stage venerable sovereigns, we'll see what to do. If it doesn't work, we'll kill them!""It just so happens that I can create more and bigger movements!"Li Hao was still unwilling to leave.Otherwise, he would really have borrowed the power of the seventh step for nothing this time.Moreover, he wanted to use the chess to create a real big movement.As for not having a chance to use it again after using it once ... This was not a problem. Didn't Kong Ji say so?He would go through the first stage and truly obtain the opportunity to comprehend Dao chess.After passing the first trial, he would have a chance to go to the second trial. After passing a thousand squares, he could make a request ... Since Li Hao had used a move, Kong Ji was still there, so he must have sensed it.When that time came ... According to the opportunity that Li Hao had fought for for him before, all he had to do was walk 1000 more squares to fight for a chance for himself.As for whether Kong Ji would understand and do this ... Li Hao felt that he didn't need to say.Let's help each other. We'll have another chance to discuss Dao in the future.This was not a big problem.Of course, just in case ... Li Hao would still remind him that Kong Ji was in seclusion to comprehend, so he wouldn't mention it. This time, he still left the giant pincer behind, and he could ask Kong Ji to mention it later.If he couldn 't, the fifth-order venerable sovereign of the divine light realm was still there, so it would be the same if he asked him to convey the message.Summoning the chess pieces here didn't require too much energy.It didn't even need to consume energy.However ... In order to let the Dao chess show its powerful Emperor's might ... It was best to do it outside the chaos. The power of the Dao accumulation of an eighth-tier great cosmos was the key.Li Hao could leave, and he wouldn't have to waste so many benefits.However, walking like this would not attract much attention from the red moon.Then, he would not be able to achieve his goal of coming to Tian Fang.Kong Ji was thinking that Li Hao was not at a disadvantage. Li Hao had to think about bringing Heaven's Fate, King Huai, and Lin Hongyu back safely. Otherwise, they would still be waiting there and could not be communicated with easily.If Red Moon kept an eye on them, they would be in big trouble.With all kinds of thoughts, Li Hao made a decision again. This time, it didn't matter if he lost some. As for the yin and yang comprehension of neo martial arts, it wasn't as important as before. It didn't matter if he couldn't get it. If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have asked uncle Hong and the others to pick him up.However, at that time, Li Hao insisted on advancing with yin and yang. Now that he had thought it through, yin and yang were no longer that important. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Everyone's safety was the most important.He had hidden the Silver Moon, so the others ... Those below venerable sovereign could blend in at will. Venerable sovereigns would be the center of attention, and he could not just leave them in the chaos.Otherwise, these people would be discovered by the red moon sooner or later.Li Hao, we have to bring them back.As for how to arrange it and how to advance, that would be a matter for the future."It's not too dangerous this time ... Qian Wuliang, be careful. There won't be a big problem. "Li Hao smiled."It's only targeted at the weak. It's enough to make a big scene. Don't worry about anything else."Qian Wuliang felt helpless.That being said, the point was that there were many venerable sovereigns here. It would be troublesome if a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns came.He's only a Tier 2, alright!Of course, this time, he didn't take too much risk. In fact, Li Hao had asked him to do dangerous work. He had been a little worried when he had wanted to leave but hadn't done it, but now that he heard it ... He felt that it was only natural.He wouldn't feel at ease if he didn't do some dangerous work.With Li Hao around, who had even killed a level six venerable sovereign, he was actually quite at ease.At this moment, he nodded and said,"alright!" However, Lord Marquis, the Silvermoon universe is only a second-tier universe, after all, and it's still too far away from a ninth-tier universe. Even with the powerful sovereign weapon that Lord Marquis mentioned, it might not make people believe that this is the recovery of a ninth-tier universe ... Furthermore, the core of a great Dao is different. "Since he was going to do it, of course, the more perfect it was, the better.He had to make everyone believe him.Even the middle-stage venerable sovereigns believed it. This way, everyone would be convinced that the tianfang great Dao universe was going to be completely restored.There was another point. The core of the tianfang great Dao universe was space.Even though it was displaying the power of 10000 DAOs, the crucial spatial layers ... True experts would still be able to detect some of them."Space is in the domain!"A domain was also a type of space.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"it's very difficult to create spatial chaos and sense of space, but it's not impossible!"Li Hao suddenly laughed and looked at Qian Wuliang. "Let's play something more exciting this time. I'll give you the long river of Dao. How about combing it out and weaving it? I've comprehended a few thousand ways to weave a bed, more than two thousand ... Of course, it's not perfect yet, but I'll weave it a little. I'll use the power of the domain to create an unstable bed-calling space and cover the sky, creating a chaotic space. I'll overturn the sky, move the city, and break the barriers of the small regions ... This way, I'll be able to show the true chaotic space!"
