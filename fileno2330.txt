BOOM!Once again, a powerful force burst out. The venerable sovereign frowned and turned around to punch. At the same time, a gate in the void suddenly pressed down. It was the Stargate.As soon as the Stargate descended, the body of the venerable sovereign trembled and the shadow of the sword venerable slashed out. BOOM!The venerable sovereign took a few steps back and the giant fist disappeared. A crack appeared on his hand and blood kept falling.In the sky, the great path universe began to seal. The sword-carrying man was bathed in blood, but his expression was cold. "You're just the weakest venerable sovereign ... Stargate, universal Eight Trigram array ... When the lifeless sword is completed, I'll come and meet you again. I'll kill a venerable sovereign to celebrate my promotion to a venerable sovereign!"The lifeless sword!The venerable sovereign's face turned ugly. The great path universe had been completely sealed and disappeared in an instant. The venerable sovereign shouted angrily and punched at the sky. BOOM! The sky shattered!However, the great path universe had already disappeared."You're really good with your words. I wonder if you can save Silvermoon!"Venerable Red Moon sovereign snorted.This time, the great path universe had descended through yueshen.The moon goddess, who was already injured, once again acted as a coordinate to lock onto this place and tear down the world barrier. Whether or not she could survive was still a question.He looked down at his hand, the Stargate in the sky, and the apparition of venerable sword. The red moon Thearch frowned slightly and looked into the distance.This time ... That guy might have gotten the better end of the deal.The lifeless sword?After swallowing the longevity Swordmaster's sword, it was called the lifeless sword? But ... Could he really succeed?He raised his eyebrows slightly. He had killed Li Hao with a single palm strike earlier, but ... Was he really dead?He knew a little about Li Hao.Killing the other party was too easy.Although he was a venerable sovereign, and it was normal for him to slap the other party to death, this Li Hao was different from the Li Hao He knew."I can faintly ... Sense another power. It's a pity ... Li daoheng's sword appeared too quickly. I don't have time to investigate ..."He looked up at the sky and sneered.Li daoheng ... What was the point of creating so many clones?If his true body was here, he might be able to detect some clues.But I'm not here. Can that sword of yours ... Really succeed?What a joke!In any case, Red Moon Thearch did not think that Li Hao was dead. He thought that Li Hao had faked his death!Of course, it did not matter to him. Whether it was li daoheng or Li Hao, whoever won ... In any case, they weren't anything good. It would be best if both sides suffered heavy losses and died together.……In the depths of the universe.The huge sword city broke through the sky.Above the sword city, a young man gradually appeared. His face seemed extremely pale. The entire sword city was shattering, and some cracks appeared. However, he revealed a smile.However, in the next moment, his expression changed slightly as he looked into the distance.The city Lord's mansion was no longer there.At this moment, the place where Li Hao had been standing suddenly flashed with a faint light. It was extremely illusory, as if someone was walking out of the illusion!The sky suddenly split open, and a long river appeared. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  A figure gradually appeared above the river. Holding the Galaxy Sword, Li Hao walked out of the river and said softly,""If the Dao vanishes, I'll annihilate. If the Dao exists, I'll exist. The venerable emperors may destroy my body, but they won't destroy my spirit. Li daoheng ... Or rather, lifeless sword, it looks like it'll be very difficult for you to succeed!"He walked out of the illusion.It landed on the huge long sword, and the long sword seemed to be jumping for joy. It was the real starry sky sword. It was sent flying by the venerable sovereign's punch, but it did not break. This was the real sword of the venerable sword!Li Hao held the mini starry sky sword, and three remnant spirits appeared in the illusion.The three spirits were extremely shocked!Aren't we dead?Why did he come out?Li Hao chuckled and said,"when people die, the Dao exists. In a short time, the river will flow and can be revived!" I just need a little more time to reverse time and space, and I'll return!"In the distance, the young man's expression changed, and his voice was cold,""What a good 'reverse time and space, my return'! However, as I expected, you won't be able to return after cutting off this River!"His aura suddenly became fierce."I was thinking the same thing. A guy who dared to attack a venerable sovereign and draw a sword against a venerable sovereign died so easily and quickly. I thought it was inappropriate. It seems that I have underestimated you!""It's not just the river that's broken. I'll kill you. If I kill you again ... I'm afraid you won't be able to recover. You have a special power in you. As long as I take this power away, you'll die without a doubt!"Li Hao nodded,"you have good eyes!" I have to say, without me ... You should have been able to succeed and refine everything ... You dared to attack venerable sovereigns with just your two avatars. If your main body had succeeded in the new Dao, your three avatars would have combined into one, devoured everything, and mastered the great Dao ... You would have been an Overlord of the great thousand universe ... But ... Why are you provoking me?"As soon as he finished speaking, he walked through the void with his sword in hand.Li Hao pulled out his sword and said softly,"your realm is higher than mine. You're stronger than me. Even now, you're stronger than me. I won't take advantage of you, and you can't take advantage of me either ... Cut off the connection with sword city.""Do you think that's possible?"The man with the long sword laughed. The next moment, his expression suddenly changed. At this moment, Li Hao slashed out with his sword. A pure longevity sword intent overflowed and slashed at the sword city!The sword city trembled violently as the sword will entered the city!Li Hao actually didn't use it to kill the enemy!

Chapter 2331 Sword Of Time (3 In 1)
He had spent seven days to collect this powerful sword intent. At this moment, it merged into the sword city. In an instant, the sword city burst out with an extremely bright light!BOOM!With a loud bang, the sword intent exploded. With a boom, the man with the long sword flew backward with a bang. A mouthful of golden blood spurted out, and countless sword intents scattered. His body turned illusory for a moment and turned into a long sword.The faint line that connected the sword city to the outside world was instantly broken!The aura of the lifeless sword instantly dropped by a large margin.From the half-step sovereign realm, it continued to fall until it was about to fall from the Heavenly King realm. The man with the long sword appeared again with a slight shock."You ... Have mastered the longevity sword intent?"Li Hao didn't use this sword intent to kill the enemy. Instead, he stimulated the real starry sky sword and made it burst out and recover for a moment. It drove the lifeless sword away and stopped the other party from devouring it!Li Hao smiled."It's fair this way. You're an early Heavenly King, and I'm a peak Saint ... However, I'm a human, you're a sword, I'm the main body, and you're a clone. I can accept that you're a little higher than me ... But lifeless sword, what do you think of the current situation?""Fair!" Soundless sword laughed.He didn't seem to be too desperate and nodded.""That's fair enough. I'm very interested in the special energy in your body! Of course, you should also be very interested in me. What's your name?""Li Hao!"Li Hao said. Holding the mini starry sky sword, he squatted down and gently touched the still-trembling sword city."Be quiet and arrange a good place for us to have a good spar! Li daoheng's sword clone must be very powerful ... No matter who wins, your sword with insufficient spirit will not be able to escape from us. I can only say that the sword venerable is not gentle enough with his sword. It can't even gather a bit of spirit. "The young man with the long sword remained silent.At this moment, the world spun.The two of them seemed to have appeared on a huge arena.Li Hao exhaled and looked at the other side.""Now ... Shall we exchange pointers?""As you wish!"The longsword-wielding youth chuckled and instantly turned into a black sword. Without a sound, it instantly appeared above Li Hao's head. Li Hao swung his sword, and the two swords collided. In the distance, the three remnant spirits were dumbfounded.This Li Hao ... They still didn't know how to pull them out of death. At this moment, seeing that Li Hao was fighting with the other party, the three spirits were about to help when Li Hao's voice was heard.""No, I want to kill him alone! Only in this way can the starry sky sword in my hand devour his entire body and become a powerful sword. A swordsman's sword must learn to fight by itself! I'm going to use him to sharpen the sword in my hand!"Perhaps, this sword that had been following him could no longer be called the starry sky sword.No matter what, killing this lifeless sword in this battle was also a form of training for his own sword.The two swords crossed, and the sword essence split the air!The three spirits looked at them with a complicated expression ... If these two were still in the era of venerable the sword, they would definitely be the best inheritors of the way of the sword, and venerable the sword would be very pleased!With these two people around, the Dao of the sword would definitely flourish!What a pity!Li daoheng was a traitor who had killed the bloodline of the Li family. He was an out-and-out lunatic, a demon.And this Li Hao ... Didn't seem to be much better off than that guy. Of course, at least Li Hao didn't kill anyone from the Li family.…… In the arena, the two swords kept clashing.Sword intent spread in all directions, and killing intent overflowed. Li Hao held his sword, and his eyes flickered. Like a Night Elf, his sword was silent and enchanting. The Willow leaves fluttered, and in the blink of an eye, they turned into the earth, with unparalleled defense!At this moment, Li Hao was using many combat techniques.Earthcover sword, Heavenly Sword, light sword, Dark Sword, willow tree sword, Azure light sword ... The sword intent of the sword venerable was very powerful ... But Li Hao also had his own inheritance and sword principle.The Silver Moon Martial Master was his teacher.On the other side, the lifeless sword only had one characteristic-ruthlessness!Killing with a sword!As the two sides clashed, bloody wounds appeared on Li Hao's body, so deep that his bones could be seen.Every time they collided, they would leave behind bloody wounds that were so deep that one could see the bones. They would leave behind streams of sword intent, which would impact his body and cause blood to spray out.There was no further communication.He didn't need it!Li Hao displayed the sword techniques he knew one by one. He could use them with ease, but unfortunately, they were not lethal enough, and the starry sky sword in his hand was not sharp enough. There were even faint cracks on it.The sword techniques of a group of martial masters ... How could they compare to li daoheng, a swordsman who was proficient in the will of the revered sword?It was messy and gaudy!Did Li Hao know?He knew!He knew that he knew a lot, but none of them were strong, very weak, and some of them were of little value.At this moment, the swords of light and darkness exploded together!The fusion of the two swords!In the next moment, the five elements sword burst forth and the five swords merged!The lifeless sword's cold voice rang out."You're very bold. You used me to practice your sword. Do you want to merge the sword of ten thousand DAOs?" The sword of the sword Saint is also a sword of ten thousand DAOs. Do you want to start from the beginning and merge with the different ten thousand DAOs swords?"What great ambition!However, can you succeed?Li Hao laughed."One step at a time. I've already named my sword technique. Bright moon sword!" It is also divided into ten swords, a hundred swords, a thousand swords, and finally, the ten thousand swords!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Land of the Silver Moon, bright moon in the sky! Ten strikes can kill an early Heavenly King, a hundred strikes can kill a peak Heavenly King, a thousand strikes can kill a half-step sovereign, and ten thousand strikes can kill a venerable sovereign ... What do you think?"

Chapter 2332 Sword Of Time (1)
"We'll talk after you succeed!"The two sides exchanged blows, and sword light rose from all directions!Li Hao closed his eyes, and his Seven Swords turned into one. At this moment, the ninth-stage force erupted, and the ninth-stage force merged into one!They were the most basic secret techniques, but in Li Hao's case, they displayed unimaginable effects. The five elements of wind, Thunder, light, and darkness combined into one and slashed out!BOOM!For the first time, the lifeless sword flew backward, and a faint mark appeared on the sword."Only Nine Swords into one ... I'm afraid it's not enough!"The lifeless sword disappeared again. The next moment, it suddenly burst out with a dazzling sword intent. The sword cut through the void and pierced through Li Hao. Li Hao turned around and attacked again. Li Hao blocked it with his sword, but the starry sky sword trembled violently!Yes, there was only the sword of nine paths, which was also one of the nine techniques that Li Hao often used.The tenth sword seemed to be unable to be displayed.Outside, a few Saints could not wait. Jian Shu was also experienced and knowledgeable. At this moment, he said hurriedly,""Nine Swords as one ... And the longevity sword intent. I must kill him with the longevity sword intent!"What are you waiting for?Melt!Haven't you been trying to comprehend the longevity sword essence?  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Can't you use it at all?If the ten swords combined into one, it was possible to kill this guy!The lifeless sword laughed and said in a faint voice,""Longevity sword? Sword tree, you're really foolish ... The longevity sword isn't a sword Dao! You've comprehended too little of the sword of the sword venerable. The longevity sword will and the myriad DAOs return to one is a sword of unity. How can you integrate it? Stupid!"Li Hao also sighed."That's right. Ten swords need to be a pure single sword that can fuse with the longevity sword intent. Is there a need to make it so complicated?"The sword tree ... He still didn't have enough enlightenment.After all, monster plants were not humans, and they were not pure swordsmen."The ten swords are the foundation, and all swords have a Center. The longevity sword will is not my heart of the sword ... I will not walk the exact same path as the sword Saint. I can become stronger by learning from him, but I can not transcend ...""Lifeless sword, what kind of sword intent do you think I should use to command the ten thousand swords?"Li Hao instantly disappeared. He smiled brightly."How about you guess?"The lifeless sword suddenly turned into a young man. Frowning, he looked at Li Hao and said solemnly,""That energy of yours is very weak. You can't control it well. Do you dare to use that as your base?""Why wouldn't I?"At this moment, a special energy fluctuation burst out of Li Hao's body, and time and space seemed to freeze!Li Hao smiled and said,'I was also thinking, which sword intent can command all the swords in the world? There were both advantages and disadvantages, until ... Now, I know that time is the scariest!""The tenth sword ... Time sword!"BOOM!A special fluctuation spread out in all directions, and the void seemed to freeze. An invisible sword intent appeared and merged into the nine Swords. It was invisible and intangible!The nine sword principles were instantly subdued!At this moment, the nine sword principles, which had been fighting each other, were freely kneaded by the time sword principle. In an instant, the starry sky sword in Li Hao's hand turned transparent. Li Hao seemed to have aged a bit, but he also seemed to have become a bit younger in the blink of an eye.At this moment, the lifeless sword seemed to wake up. He slashed with his sword, and the long sword exploded with an extremely powerful force."Kill!"Li Hao also swung his sword and shouted,""Die!"BOOM!The two sword intents collided, and the air came to a standstill. Two waves of energy swept through the heavens and earth. Bang! Bang! Bang! The three saints on the outside were instantly sent flying. They could only watch helplessly as they were unable to Dodge. In an instant, all three saints were covered in injuries!Li Hao thrust his sword, and the lifeless sword seemed to sink into a quagmire. With a crack, a weak sound was heard.The starry sky sword pierced into the longsword and a suction force spread out.It devoured the power of essence!"In your dreams!"The lifeless sword let out a shrill cry and transformed back into his human form. The starry sky sword had already pierced into his body. He grabbed the starry sky sword with one hand and revealed a fierce look in his eyes.In your dreams!This sword had actually fused with a special energy that interfered with his circulation. It was extremely terrifying!However, it was not enough. The power was still a little weak.At that moment, a violent devouring force came from his body. The starry sky sword started to tremble violently. All the sword Dao essence that it had devoured earlier returned!Not only that, even some of the starry sky sword's original essence started to flow away.His opponent ... Had a stronger devouring power than the starry sky sword!"So, you are the sword, and I am the human!"At this moment, Li Hao suddenly laughed. In an instant, it was as if he had turned into a long river that surrounded the entire lifeless sword. The rivers of the great path washed over the lifeless sword!The lifeless sword, who had just taken the initiative, suddenly shouted angrily,""This is a battle of sword Dao!"Shameless!At this moment, he was a little angry!Previously, Li Hao was like a real swordsman, but at this moment, he shamelessly used the power of ten thousand DAOs to cleanse him. This was not a swordsman!"Swordsman? No, you still don't understand. The sword is only the form, and the Dao is the foundation. Ten thousand DAOs return to the sword. This is the philosophy of the sword venerable. You don't even understand the true philosophy of the sword venerable, how can you talk about being a swordsman? Do you dare to say that the sword Saint is not a swordsman?"Changhe, feidao?Of course it was!"Fallacy ..."BOOM!The long river surged wildly. Although Li Hao's myriad Dao was weak, it had indeed taken shape. At this moment, it washed over the young man, and the young man turned into a long sword again, just like how he washed the venerable sovereign's blood essence that day. At this moment, the sword was shaking madly in the river, trying to break out of the predicament!However, how could it be that easy?Under the impact, the longsword continued to burst out with powerful sword intent. At this moment, the starry sky sword entered the river and began to charge!

Chapter 2333 Sword Of Time (3 In 1)_6
BOOM!A powerful battle broke out between the two parties in the long river. The long river kept shaking, and under the suppression of 10000 rays, the starry sky sword once again pierced through the lifeless sword body. Waves of powerful force continued to overflow!Very quickly, it was devoured by the starry sky sword!After a long time, a destructive force overflowed from the lifeless sword. At this moment, the young man's voice rang out again,""You want to get it ...? Dream on!"Li Hao, however, was in no hurry."Lifeless sword, you've disappointed me. The real li daoheng won't destroy himself now. He'll only let me devour him, then kill me and take my sword!" After the starry sky sword absorbed you, he would be able to take it back and obtain an even stronger sword! Isn't it?"The young man's voice faltered.This was indeed li daoheng's style!What's the point of destruction?Since the starry sky sword won and absorbed the lifeless sword, I'll kill Li Hao and take back the sword. I'll become even stronger. I'll be destroying my own blood, sweat, and tears!"You ... Seem to understand him very well!""It's alright!"Li Hao appeared instantly, and the river disappeared. He grabbed the lifeless sword and poured the power of great DAOs into it, suppressing the destructive power. The opponent's momentary hesitation gave Li Hao the opportunity to suppress it!The long sword trembled, and a voice came."You can't win against him ... I'm just a sword. Even if you use all your techniques, you can only barely suppress me. How are you going to win against him?"The sword trembled violently. At this moment, the starry sky sword had almost completely enveloped him. Endless devouring power emerged and madly absorbed all the energy in the lifeless sword.The lifeless sword trembled violently, but there was not much despair or unwillingness. It only sighed."Li Hao, you're just his test subject ... The benefits he'll get from you far exceed what you'll get from him ..."Li Hao nodded."I know. The great Dao universe is his greatest discovery. Therefore ... He owes me!" You're the interest ... Pay me some interest first, and we'll talk about the future later!"BOOM!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  With a loud boom, the lifeless sword began to break. It kept changing illusionary, turning into a sword body and then into a young man.His voice remained calm,"interest?" Perhaps ... You will pay an even greater price!"Li Hao suddenly laughed. He was no longer as calm as before. Instead, his smile was mischievous and gleeful. "I'll tell you a secret, you ... Can't send back any news!"The lifeless sword trembled slightly, and at this moment, Li Hao forcefully tore the void apart!Countless stars appeared!There were even five large cities that appeared. Li Hao roared, and with a loud boom, the lifeless sword was completely shattered. A ray of light flashed and disappeared as if it was going to break through the universe.These were some of the spirits li daoheng had left behind!This was his sword clone. Even after death, it could still return.However, at this moment, Li Hao tore apart the Dao universe. It was very difficult to do so here, but li daoheng had just torn apart the void Dao universe, giving Li Hao an opportunity.The void was torn apart, but there were still people in the big cities who saw the universe crack and Li Hao ... And were somewhat surprised.At this moment, Li Hao shouted,""The starry sky!"The starry sky sword instantly broke through the void and entered the great path of the universe. In an instant, it burst out with a brilliant radiance. In the endless void, a star seemed to be a little interested and suddenly appeared.Everything in the world stopped in an instant!Including the escaping light spot, it stopped in an instant. The huge star instantly appeared beside the starry sky sword and circled it, as if it was sizing it up and looking at something curiously.At this moment, everything was still!As for Li Hao, with the word "Dao" above his head, he moved with difficulty. Soon, he moved to the side of the light spot and smiled.Can you still run away like this?Then I'll give it to you!The starry sky sword had attracted that star ... This was a novel thing. Next time, whether or not it could attract something even more novel would depend on whether there was something even more novel. Li Hao seemed to have grasped some of the uniqueness of this star.Without something new, the other party would not appear.Li Hao didn't say anything. He didn't even look at the star. Without a word, he punched at the light spot!BOOM!The sky fell and the earth cracked. This time, it seemed to have frightened the star ... The star disappeared in an instant, and the bright sword intent burst out from the light spot, but it was instantly scattered. A figure could be seen faintly. He was very young and looked very similar to the figure that the lifeless sword had transformed into, but his eyes were slightly different.He glanced at Li Hao and said,""Cutting off my clone ... It looks like he has a secret he doesn't want me to know ...." Looking into the distance, he seemed to see the star. He was a little shocked."So ... This ... This new Dao is so special?"BOOM!The shadow completely exploded. Li Hao didn't say anything. He turned into a long river again, washing the world. The world trembled again, and a small light spot appeared, trying to escape.Li Hao's voice came over,"I knew that people like you wouldn't be so simple ... You want to hide?" You're dreaming!"The long river's wash!Gradually, the light spots were completely washed away!It wasn't enough. Li Hao reached out and grabbed the starry sky sword. The longsword circled the world and slashed out countless times, but nothing unusual happened. Li Hao didn't stop. At this moment, the divine runes of the great path above his head suddenly overflowed with thousands of rays of light!It illuminated the entire universe!And in front of him ... An extremely weak, almost invisible, light spot attached to a corner of the universe was cut open by Li Hao's sword!Even now, Li Hao still hadn't given up. He reached out and grabbed a dog from a distant city. Li Hao kicked the Black Panther awake and shouted,""Devouring the void!"The Black Panther was at a loss. It did not care about anything else and started to devour the surrounding void!The entire void was about to be absorbed into the Black Panther's body.The Black Panther devoured all the energy that was spreading out.At the same time, Li Hao suddenly disappeared and then reappeared. He grabbed a lot of the power of the Crimson Moon from sword city, which had been left by the venerable sovereign. The Black Panther swallowed them all.In an instant, the Thunder of the great Dao descended!Boom! Boom! Boom!Lightning wash! The Black Panther was on the verge of death. It was baffled. Soon, an invisible light spot appeared in its body and exploded with a bang!……At this moment, in another part of the universe.Suddenly, an almost inaudible muffled groan was heard. Soon, it was accompanied by a slight smile."He really has some tricks ..."No one else but Li Hao.What a good method!He had set up countless traps in the lifeless sword, but ... At this point, they had all been completely destroyed by someone, leaving nothing behind. Who else could it be if not Li Hao?Is there something you're hiding from me?……In the Dao universe, Li Hao exhaled. He grabbed the starry sky sword and kicked the Black Panther away."Go back. Don't leave the Dao universe for a while. Let Lin Hongyu get some Crimson Moon Power to cleanse you a few more times ..."Heibao's eyes were filled with innocence and confusion.As soon as I opened my eyes, I was caught by you and started to devour the void. Then, I was struck by lightning for a long time for no reason. Now, you don't want to get out of here, and you want to continue attacking me ... Who did I offend?Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't say anything more and instantly retreated.In this place, he couldn't open the great Dao universe frequently. Otherwise, he would be easily locked on by that venerable sovereign!The great Dao was everywhere and could be opened, but if it was too many times, once it was sensed by a venerable sovereign and locked on, the other party might really force his way in. That would be troublesome. The current great Dao universe could not stop a venerable sovereign!The next moment, Li Hao reappeared above sword city.The three remnant spirits were all shocked!It ended?The extremely powerful lifeless sword was destroyed by Li Hao just like that?He suddenly felt ... Very relaxed and not that dangerous?Li Hao smiled and didn't say anything.Was it dangerous?Without the power of time, I'll just die without an intact corpse. I've finally witnessed the palm of a venerable sovereign. Compared to these top-notch existences ... It's still too weak!

2334 Chapter 391
Above the sword city.Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief. Everything had gone smoothly, but ... He had still exposed something. The red moon sovereign had probably sensed something.Resurrection!He had been resurrected from the hands of venerable sovereigns.As Li Hao thought about this, he thought about the power of time. He judged that as long as this power was still there and the river of time continued, he had a chance of reversing time ... This was wrong. In fact, it was reversing something that had happened to him.It wasn't to reverse the others!If it really reached that stage ... It was not something that Li Hao could do. Moreover, every time he used it, he would consume some of his lifespan. In fact, he couldn't use it recklessly."Li daoheng ... Is truly a talent!"  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Li Hao suddenly sighed,'a half-Emperor's clone and a sword Dao clone. Is Xindao a clone or the original? This guy, did he feel that he couldn't enter the Overlord-tier all these years and his spiritual power grew too fast, so he cut himself for fun?"A clone wasn't something that could be easily cut out.Li daoheng's casual cutting meant that he was stuck at the half-step sovereign realm and couldn't step into the venerable sovereign realm. Perhaps he felt that he was too weak to advance to the venerable sovereign realm and needed to be stronger.Therefore, he kept cutting his spiritual power and creating all kinds of clones.They were all extremely powerful!If this sword had not suffered a blow from a venerable sovereign and its connection with sword city had not been cut off by Li Hao, it would at least have the combat strength of a peak Heavenly King.The one who appeared before and took the venerable sovereign's punch head-on was probably also a clone.A half-Emperor clone!At this moment, the strength of the new Dao clone was unknown, but it was at least at the level of a Sage or even stronger. However, it might not be able to leave the great Dao universe for now.Other than these ... Was there anything else?A Heavenly King from 100000 years ago, a peerless genius who had not been able to enter the venerable sovereign level for so long, who knew how many clones he had created.It was disgusting!"Li Hao!"At this moment, the sword tree rushed over.On his shoulder, the stone on the left and the seal on the right became more and more incomplete."You ..." The sword tree phantom trembled."You ... Won?"Li Hao chuckled."I'm standing here. What do you think, senior?""He won just like that?" Jianshu was still in a daze.I don't feel anything!He felt that the victory was a little unbelievable. That was created by li daoheng. Moreover ... Did they just go to the venerable sovereign's territory?"Did we get hit by the venerable sovereign's palm just now?" it could not help but ask."Yes."“……”  Jian Shu mumbled,"we were hit by the venerable sovereign's palm. We ... Are only Saints ... And the Saints of this era. We are not origin Saints. How can we survive?"A venerable sovereign!An incredibly powerful existence, no matter what era it was, would be a Supreme existence. In the Silvermoon world, there was only one existence.But now, they were alive again after being killed by a venerable sovereign.This ... What was this?He was not a tree that had not seen the world. He had followed venerable sword and seen many top-notch existences. The red moon Emperor was not a big deal among the venerable sovereigns, but he was still a venerable sovereign!It couldn't understand what kind of power it was that could resurrect everyone.Even though it had personally experienced it, it still couldn't understand it.Of course, at this moment, it didn't have the time to ask for details. It looked at the disappearing sword city. At this moment, they were on an extremely huge long sword. This was the original appearance of sword city-a sword!It was an extremely huge sword that extended for hundreds of miles!"This is the starry sky sword ...""I've never seen the real starry sky sword,"Jian Shu murmured.It was only planted in the sword city after it existed.Li Hao's heart moved."You mean you're actually very young. You're considered a descendant of the monster plants. You're not an early stage neo-martial artist?"The sword tree nodded. It wasn't that old to begin with."Well, otherwise, I've been comprehending the venerable sword Dao ... If I'm already in the early stage of the neo martial realm, I'd be a Heavenly King!"Who are you underestimating?Li Hao chuckled and looked at the courtyard not far away. It was the only building in the entire sword city that was still intact.Anping residence!Although the words "human King" didn't have any charm of "bed", the words and the advantage of sword city didn't cause any damage to the small courtyard since the venerable sovereign's punch didn't completely cover it.Of course, there was another possibility. Red Moon sovereign ... Was worried that a human King apparition would appear if he destroyed the courtyard.The possibility was not high.Venerable sword was outside. If the courtyard was gone and the human King was still alive, he might not have the time to care about him. However, if he really appeared ... Red Moon Emperor would definitely feel guilty.He was not an ordinary venerable sovereign, but a human King.The neo martial world was also known as the yin-yang world in the chaosverse.In the yin-yang world, the human King was not very famous ... However, there was one non-world Lord in this world, the sun god, the number one master in the beginner martial state. He traveled in the chaos, dared to fight with the world Lord, fought with the red moon master, and escaped back to new martial state.Just because of this, in the chaos, in the yin-yang world, he was not a nobody.The sun god had some reputation in the chaos. Although he was not as powerful as some of the more powerful world Lords, some of the weaker world Lords were actually no match for him!Even a small world like silver Moon, which had been completely devoured, would probably not have reached the level of the sun god.Of course, anything was possible with the appearance of a new Dao universe.

2335 Chapter 391
……Li Hao didn't have the time to think about this.The starry sky sword trembled, and there was a glimmer of light.After devouring the lifeless sword, Li Hao's starry sky sword had made a huge profit. Not only that, but it had also devoured some special power of time, which was no small matter. At this moment, the starry sky sword seemed to be in a deep sleep, absorbing and digesting the energy."Now that you have the real starry sky sword ... It's not appropriate for you to be called the starry sky sword!" Li Hao murmured.Perhaps it was time for this sword to have a new name."Do you ... Really want to swallow sword city?" Jian Shu couldn't help but ask.Li Hao shook his head, and Jian Shu heaved a sigh of relief. Li Hao suddenly said,""I suspect ... The eight divine weapons are the eight main cities?""Ah?""I say, the real eight godly weapons ..." Li Hao said."Are they the ones right now, or are the eight main cities the real eight godly weapons?"Jianshu was confused,"no way?" There are eight main cities ... It's possible for the sword of revered sword to become a sword city, but how could the other main cities be divine weapons?""But the eight main cities can resist the pressure of the world. Even half-step sovereigns would find it hard to do so. Have you all not thought about this?""That's ... That's ..."Jian Shu couldn't explain it, and Li Hao fell into deep thought. After a long while, he said,""Perhaps, the eight main cities are the true eight great divine weapons! However, outsiders might not know, and even the eight great families might not know ... The eight great cities suppressing the world were obviously powerful divine weapons! I've only devoured a few sacred-grade weapons before, and none of them were even at the Heavenly King level. "He was too weak!This did not match the importance of the eight godly weapons."But ... Back then, the clan heads of the major cities were only Saints ..." Jian Shu said, puzzled."That's right, then how did they create such a powerful weapon like the main city? So ... They may not know it themselves. The eight divine weapons that are spread outside are just what they think. Maybe in the eyes of venerable the sword and the others, the real eight divine weapons are the eight main cities!""The main cities are so powerful that only the Saints can barely control them. Every time they control them, they can suppress the heaven and earth. More importantly, the eight main cities are connected to the entire heaven and earth and can devour the power of the heaven and earth ..."Then, Li Hao smiled."It's probably the work of the blood Emperor. His blade is at the center of the eight parts of the world, and the eight main cities guard the eight sides ... I understand now. The ground of the eight main cities can absorb the energy of the qi and blood of the eight main cities.""When a person dies, they will be devoured. The scattered Qi, blood, and energy will all be devoured ..."Li Hao completely understood. He shook his head and said,""You've taken great pains! One of the reasons was that the eight major cities suppressed the world! Secondly, it's to resurrect the thing in the knife. Why would the blood Emperor ... Go through so much trouble to resurrect a cat?"They didn't hear what they said earlier. "A cat?" Jian Shu was stunned."Yes,""It's in the blood Emperor's saber?""Yes.""You guys know him? Emperor Cang?" Li Hao was puzzled."No!"Jian Shu shook his head quickly."Emperor Cang is alive and well, better than anyone else. The blood Emperor died, but Emperor Cang did not die ... Ahem, that's not what I meant. What I meant was ... Forget it. I didn't mean it that way."At this moment, Jian Shu seemed to have thought of something. After a long time, he said,""I have a rough idea ... Who the blood Emperor is going to resurrect."It was a little emotional, a little sorrowful, and a little envious.However, the stone and the seal didn't seem to be clear either."The blood Emperor resurrected a cat," Shi TOU said."Do you know the sword tree?""I don't know him ... But I've heard of him before! The sword Saint once mentioned that this cat is very special ... Forget it, let's not talk about this. ""You can't tell me?" Li Hao laughed."It's not that I can't tell you. "The sword tree sighed."I don't know how to explain the cat ... And the blood Emperor wants to resurrect the cat ... It's actually very complicated. I don't know how to explain the cat. Anyway ... It has a lot to do with Emperor Cang!" I thought ... I thought it had completely disappeared. I didn't expect it to still exist! Of course, I haven't experienced that era. If we're talking about understanding it, there's definitely someone who knows it better than me. Isn't the grandson of the Supreme Being in Silver Moon? If you want to know, you can ask him yourself. He definitely knows more inside information than I do. "Li Hao nodded slightly."In other words, the blood Emperor's actions of resurrecting the other party ... Is considered normal in your eyes?""It's normal!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Jian Shu nodded and said,'the blood Emperor and the celestial Thearch he fought in his previous life are both loyal and righteous people! "The rise of the human King was partly set up after Zhan Tiandi's death and partly guided by the blood Emperor ... In fact, the human King's contact with martial arts was guided by the blood Emperor. He was only a year older than the human King, but he had been leading the way for him ..."Li Hao didn't know this.He thought for a moment and said,"so, in order to resurrect this cat, the blood Emperor left behind his saber and a few other powerful divine weapons. He divided the world into eight parts and created a formation to absorb the energy, blood, and faith from the world. In your opinion, all of these are normal. There is no other purpose?"Sword tree laughed,"that's normal!" Other purposes? Betray neo martial? You're thinking too much! Besides, in the eyes of the blood Emperor ... If the world of the Silver Moon did not belong to the sword Saint, he would not even bat an eye if he used the Silver Moon in exchange for the resurrection of this cat!"

2336 Chapter 391
Li Hao nodded, having gained some understanding."Who was the blood Emperor close to?" he asked."Who was he close to during the early martial era?""This ... I'm not sure!"Jian Shu shook his head and said,'in fact, he had a good relationship with all beginner martial artists because he was Zhan Tiandi in his previous life ... And Zhan Tiandi was one of the leaders of the beginner martial origin era! So ... The surviving beginner martial stage powerhouses are actually moving closer to these few!"Alright!He still couldn't identify the God of beginner martial.Li Hao looked at sword city, thought for a moment, and said,""If the eight main cities are all divine weapons, and the eight divine weapons ... Are these main cities, then sword city is not in a hurry.""Can I enter this courtyard and cultivate for a while?" he asked."Of course!"Jian Shu nodded and said hesitantly,"then what do we do next?" The venerable sovereigns already know that you've barged into this place. If you want to leave, you might have to go through the seal. If they know that you've entered ..."I can't leave.Li Hao didn't care. How could he not be able to leave?He could leave the Dao universe!It was just that he didn't want to open it too many times.He could definitely leave!The key was ... Why was he in such a hurry to leave?This time, he had also gained some insights and gains. Furthermore, his own sword principle had also been officially opened.Bright moon sword!Of course, it was only the beginning. The key was that the ten swords had barely formed, and they were mainly based on the intent of time. For Li Hao, it would be of great benefit to his swordsmanship if he cultivated here and used the power of time to gather the longevity swords of the venerable swordsman and verify them with each other!He was not in a hurry to leave this place.There was venerable the sword's most primitive sword intent, a Whetstone, and a sword tree that had been following venerable the sword ... Why were they in a hurry to leave?As for that venerable sovereign ... Perhaps he could also be used as a tool to sharpen his sword.The prerequisite was ... That he was not killed by the other party.It was useless to go back. If he went back now, he would fall into the trap of Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and the others.Li Hao knew very well that he didn't have the strength to contend with these two at the moment.As for venerable sovereigns ... A sealed venerable sovereign was worse than a dog.That guy can't get out of the eight trigrams Formation anyway!If it really comes out, the first ones to be anxious would be Zheng Yu and Li daoheng, not me. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  After thinking this through, Li Hao happily invited the three of them to live in the small courtyard with him.Li Hao had always been good at turning the tables.Moreover, the sword city had been almost destroyed by the venerable sovereign's punch. There was nothing left. They could only live on the broken sword body instead of the small courtyard.……Anping residence.Li Hao was cultivating in peace and also honing his sword Dao.It absorbed traces of longevity sword intent. The longevity sword essence here was much richer than that of the broken cliff, so it was easy to absorb.He was also analyzing the longevity sword will. The longevity sword will was not a small thing. It was formed by the power of thousands of DAOs gathered by the sword venerable. It was not a single sword principle. He had not seen it before, but now that he was stronger, it was easier to understand how powerful it was!Wisps of faint power of time revolved around Li Hao.Streams of sword intent continued to gather.This place was the core of the sword city, and it could even draw some of the power of the sword city.Cultivation was an intoxicating thing.The three crippled Saints were extremely anxious, but Li Hao was not ...He cultivated for many days ...Suddenly, on this day, a burst of sword intent erupted, and the three of them quickly appeared. Their true bodies were all shuddering from the shock. What had they seen?They saw a burst of longevity sword intent explode in Li Hao's body, instantly blasting him to death!"Li Hao!"The sword tree shrieked!He's dead?How dare this lunatic!How could he commit suicide with the longevity sword intent? Yes, it was suicide.It had seen with its own eyes that Li Hao had curiously used a wisp of the longevity sword intent to temper himself ... But it had exploded!This was a lunatic!At this moment, a faint power of time surrounded the area. A shallow River was rippling, but it seemed to be entangled. A faint sword will was suppressing and even obliterating this power of time.The sword tree instantly understood something and was in great pain."This madman ... This is the sword intent of venerable sword, not the palm of a half-crippled venerable sovereign ..."Sword venerable was an existence that could kill venerable sovereigns!In essence, his sword essence was much stronger than Red Moon Emperor 's.Red Moon sovereign at her peak was far inferior to venerable sword.Of all the ways to commit suicide, why did you use the longevity sword intent of the sword venerable?It shrieked, and the next moment, it transformed into its original form, a Broken sword-shaped tree. The next moment, some of its broken branches exploded and absorbed the sword intent that was obliterating Li Hao!It was used to the longevity sword intent, so it could absorb some of it.It was not until the terrifying longevity sword intent was absorbed that the long river trembled slightly. An illusionary figure walked out. His face was pale, but he was excited and excited."Amazing, so amazing!"The power of time was too weak, and it was almost completely obliterated by the sword intent!He looked at the sword tree and said,"thank you!."The sword tree once again turned into a woman, somewhat angry."What are you doing?"Although they had not known each other for long, they all regarded Li Hao as their hope.He had placed all his hopes on this guy!Some of them were used to relying on others. In the past, they relied on venerable the sword. After venerable the sword left, they had no one to rely on. After fighting for 100000 years, they ended up forging swords for their enemies. The three of them were very guilty and terrified.

2337 Chapter 391
But now, Li Hao's arrival had solved some of their problems. They felt that their hope lay in Li Hao.However, Li Hao ... Almost played himself to death!If it hadn't been for the fact that it could still absorb a little sword intent, Li Hao would have been completely obliterated.Was he crazy?Li Hao walked out of the void. His face was very pale, and his hair had turned white. In just a moment, the river trembled. He regained his youth, but he had only used up some of his lifespan.He, who had merged with the river, might not be able to live for a million years, but he would still have to live for hundreds of thousands of years.The sword intent had just been obliterated, and he had consumed a thousand years of his lifespan?It was probably similar!It was a harmless matter.Li Hao admitted his mistake."I was too curious and couldn't help but give it a try ... I just didn't expect that the essence of the longevity sword intent far surpasses the power of the Crimson Moon!" In other words, the red moon Emperor was not skilled enough. In terms of the degree of obliteration, he was far less powerful than venerable sword!"Li Hao took a deep breath."From the looks of it ... I'm really not an undying existence. Once li daoheng and the others unleash such an attack, they can destroy my energy. I'll still be obliterated!"He fell into deep thought.The sword tree couldn't hold back any longer,'wake up, you're only a saint now ... Even if you're a peak Saint, you're still a Saint! There's still the early Heavenly King, middle Heavenly King, late Heavenly King, peak Heavenly King, and even the half-step sovereign realm between you and venerable sovereigns! The gap between a half-step sovereign and a venerable sovereign is also huge ... If you try the attack of a venerable sovereign now, aren't you just courting death?"Li Hao nodded, but he didn't give up. He asked,""Is there a huge gap between venerable sovereigns and half-step sovereigns?"Jian Shu said helplessly,"it depends on what kind of venerable sovereign ... No matter how weak a venerable sovereign is ... In the new martial era, no matter how weak a venerable sovereign is, it's no problem for him to fight three half-step sovereigns!" Therefore, Hong Yue, a venerable sovereign, was indeed an invincible existence in Silver Moon! Even if you say that li daoheng is powerful ... Unless he has many half-step sovereign clones, he's still inferior to a venerable sovereign!"Li Hao nodded. That was indeed very powerful.At this moment, he had only opened 108 meridians in this body of his. There was a huge gap between him and the other party.Li Hao gently rubbed his head and looked at the longevity sword intent that was still overflowing. He sighed with emotion."The sword essence of the sword Saint is of a very high level! It's very difficult for me to split it up ... Only by experiencing it can I comprehend a little ... Sword tree, can you help me?""What favor?"Jian Shu had a bad feeling.Li Hao said softly,"it's better to teach a man to fish than to teach a man to fish!" "Even if I can absorb some of the sword intent of longevity, I don't understand it and can't comprehend it deeply. I want to be killed by it again and again! However, I'm worried that the situation just now will happen again ...""Stop dreaming!"The sword tree was a little angry,"he's looking for death!" A single moment of carelessness would completely obliterate him! Those who were killed by venerable the sword could not even be resurrected! I already find it unbelievable that you were able to come back to life. Of course, it also has to do with the fact that your sword intent is very weak. However, you've come back again and again ... If you make even one mistake, you'll be dead!""What's more," he continued,"I'm only in a broken state right now. I can't absorb too much sword intent!" It snorted, very dissatisfied!He had encountered a lunatic!How could one comprehend sword essence like this?"Die and then Live!"Li Hao said sincerely,"I also discovered that absorbing some of the longevity sword intent ... Actually has the effect of recovering yourselves. You have a close relationship with venerable the sword. His sword intent might be lethal to others, but to the three of you ... It's a tonic!" The stone is formed by polishing the sword will, and the sword seal is also connected to the sword city. You were rooted in the place where the revered sword used to cultivate, and the sword will that the revered sword exuded was all extracted by you ...""I only have a chance with the help of the three of you. Otherwise, no one can destroy the longevity sword intent!" This was an opportunity!He wanted to try.He was killed time and time again, and he tried to comprehend the sword essence. The sword essence of the sword venerable was too high-end. With his current strength, he could only use this extreme method to comprehend it in the midst of destruction!Only in this way could he continuously absorb the essence within.Otherwise, even if he could use it, he would never be able to catch up with the revered sword in his entire life. He knew how it worked, but he didn't know why it worked!This was the only way he could improve his sword Dao.He had completed his hundred, thousand, and ten thousand sword techniques!If he wanted to kill a venerable sovereign, he might really need the sword of ten thousand DAOs. However, if he were to rely on himself, even if he comprehended one sword will a day, such a speed could be said to be extremely monstrous. The sword of ten thousand DAOs would still need 30 years!However, 30 years ... Would be too long!It took three years for a human King to reach the Emperor realm. It's been more than a year since I officially stepped onto the martial path. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  He hadn't even become a Heavenly King, much less a monarch.A human King can kill a top-tier venerable sovereign in three years, but I'm only facing the weakest venerable sovereign, one that has been sealed for 100000 years ... I can't even take one move from him.In comparison ... Li Hao felt that he was very useless.Even if he was not on par with the neo martial artist King, he could not be too far off. A genius born in a small world was also a genius, right?Jian Shu frowned.It could not help but say,"the longevity sword will of the sword venerable sounds good, but in fact, it is the most destructive and lethal force in the world!" Every single one of them was ... Was filled with pain to the root! If you've been killed too many times, even if you can be resurrected ... The fear and pain of death will make you collapse!"

As a tree of sword principle, it had followed venerable sword for many years and knew everything about it. However, it couldn't bear to see Li Hao train in such a way, as it was too dangerous and cruel!"Li Hao, you've cultivated a new Dao and even obtained some special abilities ... You ... You can take a break!"Jian Shu advised,"it's been a hundred thousand years ... At most, I'll hide for a while. Li daoheng, Zheng Yu, and venerable Red Moon sovereign will definitely fight!" Even if the seal is really broken, they will still fight. At that time, you still have time!"Li Hao shook his head,"no, I don't have the time!" They ...... Might kill me, an unexpected factor, first. Even if they don't kill me first, if they fight randomly, the entire Silver Moon might be destroyed!"He smiled."Three seniors, only through suffering can one rise above others. I still understand this principle!""No... It's really too dangerous. We can't guarantee that we'll be able to absorb the sword intent every time. If we make a single mistake, you'll die ... We really can 't!"All three of them refused!It wasn't that they didn't believe Li Hao, but that they weren't confident in themselves.In fact, they had always been relying on the sword venerable.After venerable the sword left, they were on their own for a period of time ... But it ended in failure.Now, Li Hao had practically handed his life and death to the three of them ... What if he failed to absorb it even once?If Li Hao died ... Would they fight with venerable sovereigns?They shuddered at the thought of the power of venerable sovereigns.Stone also said gloomily,"Li Hao, we've only known each other for a short time ... You're entrusting our lives to us ... We ... We're under a lot of pressure. It's not just your problem, but also us ... To bear such pressure. One mistake, even if you die, we may not have any other way out ... It's a responsibility that decides all of our lives. We can't bear such a responsibility!" Li Hao had a headache.It wasn't that he was afraid of death, but the three of them were afraid that if he died, they wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure.She was really ... Speechless."The three of you are the people of venerable sword ...""We ... We haven't actually experienced any battles," stone said gloomily."We've entered the era of Silver Moon, and silver Moon doesn't have any battles to speak of. We've never experienced a real battle between neo martial artists! In the Silvermoon world, there aren't many who have experienced the Great War ... Only people like Zhang an and Li daoheng have gone to the origin world and participated in a few Foreign Wars!"Li Hao was stunned."Neo martial arts still has battles?" he asked.To the outside world? to Which?Stone continued,"even some chaotic desolate beasts want to invade the origin world, but they aren't too strong ... The human Kings don't care about them. They treat them as training tools. They are born in hardship and die in peace. This is what the human Kings often say. So ... Some of the Warriors of neo martial have participated in the war against the outside world." A portion of the Silver Moon's main Army has participated in this as well ... But not all of them. " "We ... We were just the mascots of sword city ... So, you don't have to say that we are close to the revered sword. We ... We were just the mascots, how could we compare to real warriors?"It had belittled itself, but that was the truth.They had not experienced much.Of course, for the past 100000 years, they had been fighting against that sword. In fact, it was not really as bad as it said. No matter how bad they were, after fighting for so many years, they were no longer good-for-nothing mascots.Li Hao raised his brows."According to my judgment, this seal will definitely be broken in three to five years at most, and a year and a half at the least!" Right now, I can only deal with ordinary early Heavenly Kings. Those stronger than that will be hard for me to deal with! If the three of you aren't willing to help, I'm afraid ... The Silver Moon will be gone!"The three of them were also very conflicted."We also want to help you ... But what if you really die?" Jian Shu was a little annoyed. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Li Hao laughed."If I'm really dead, that means I don't have the ability to become your hope!" This is just a little sword intent left by the sword Saint. If I can't even withstand a little sword intent, do you think I can fight against those few?""Is there no other way?"Li Hao nodded."Yes. I'll analyze the longevity sword intent slowly. I'm not a weakling or an idiot. Give me a hundred years, and I'm confident that I can split it. If I'm lucky, I can do it in thirty to fifty years!"This was indeed a top talent!Thirty to fifty years ... Which of the geniuses in the later stage of the neo martial era had the confidence to say that they could thoroughly study the longevity sword intent in thirty to fifty years?Sword venerable was not the same as before. He was a top venerable sovereign.Jian Shu was also at a loss and said,"how about ... You use this sword intent to kill us!" You came to resurrect us ... If we die, we die. We're people who are about to die anyway ..."Li Hao was stunned.To be honest, he had been asking them to help him, but the three of them had been resisting. He was getting impatient. He felt that the three of them were too timid, too cowardly, too afraid of death ... In any case, they were not good ideas.In the end, when the sword tree suggested that they could be used as Li Hao's test subjects instead of killed ... Li Hao was stunned.This ... What was this?He was a little distracted. After a long time, he said,"you should know that if I kill you ... It may be difficult for me to absorb the longevity sword intent. The probability of you dying is higher than me ..."Jian Shu said dejectedly,"that's nothing ... We're weak and have no talent!" Originally, we were supposed to stay behind to guard sword city and silver Moon City, but in the end ... The Li family is gone! The Silver Moon was gone! The sword Saint trusted us, but we lost Silver Moon and killed the Li family ... How are we going to explain this to the sword Saint when we meet him again? If you can succeed, then we're all dead. The world doesn't lack a tree, a rock, or a seal ... These things can be found everywhere. Even a piece of soil can become a spiritual object after following venerable Swordmaster for a thousand years!"

2339 Chapter 391
Shitou's muffled voice was also like thunder,"that's right!" There was no way to explain! We're slow-witted and not very intelligent, so we're not demons with particularly high intelligence. It's just that items with ordinary intelligence become special demons. Our potential, talent, and intelligence are all lacking. Otherwise, how could we have been toyed with by li daoheng for a hundred thousand years?""If it were venerable the sword and the others here, even if they had the same strength as us, they would have seen through it long ago ... The three of us would still be sharpening the enemy's sword stupidly!"Li Hao laughed,"don't say that!" Everything in the world had a spirit! The human race was more intelligent because they had given birth to too many experts. If the monster plants gave birth to countless experts, the stones gave birth to countless experts, the seals gave birth to countless experts ... Each generation would be stronger than the last! So, the key is that your ancestors are not strong enough!""We don't have any ancestors ..."Li Hao coughed and said,"I mean, my race!" A race! The monster plants are a large tribe, right?"He consoled them for a while. They were indeed not very intelligent!Of course, this wasn't comparing them to ordinary people, but to those powerhouses. The stronger one was, the more powerful one's spiritual power would be. In fact, one's intelligence wouldn't be bad. Compared to those of the same rank, these few people were indeed much dumber."For example, the demonic beast clan. Demonic beasts don't have intelligence to begin with, but there are many demonic beast experts. Now, I know a li Fuhai. In fact, I feel that his intelligence is very, very high ...""The Silver Moon sea Messenger?""That's right!" Jian Shu nodded."The members of the shuiliu family are all very intelligent!"Seeing this, Li Hao added, as long as a few venerable sovereigns are born in your clan, your clan will undergo a transformation! When one person achieved Dao, his chickens and dogs would rise to the heavens! This is Dao ... The prerequisite is that you must obtain Dao!"After chatting for a while, Li Hao smiled and said,"that's why I should try something I've never tried before!" Everything is difficult at the beginning, but it's simple once it's started! "When you're no longer afraid and have more confidence ... All problems will not be problems! You are all very familiar with the sword mind of the sword venerable. Why are you afraid of making mistakes? The more afraid you are, the easier it is to make mistakes!""Besides, I won't die," Li Hao said."To tell you the truth ... This is only my clone. My real body isn't here!""A clone?" Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "That's right. So, it doesn't matter if you die!"Jianshu and the others were slightly moved. Li Hao said,""Of course, if I really die, my vitality will be greatly damaged. Don't be too relaxed. If you think that Dying Is Fine, just calm down ... If I really die, then it's a little loss. It's not bad that I'm still alive, right?"At this moment, the sword tree seemed to relax a little. "It's just a clone ... Then we ... Can try. You ... Can really come back to life?"he asked."Of course!"Li Hao nodded and chuckled. In his heart, he thought ... Clone my ass.This body was indeed an avatar.However, the river was in his body. Otherwise, how could it wash away the lifeless sword?He wanted to comfort these guys.As for these few people, if they really made a mistake ... Death was actually not scary. Wealth came from danger. Knowing that if this continued, they would not be able to win against those guys, they naturally had to find another way!"Then ... Let's try!"At this moment, Jian Shu was much more confident.""This sword intent can help us recover a bit! Don't worry, we'll try our best not to make any mistakes that might destroy your clone!""Try not to let this happen," Li Hao said."Otherwise ... I can't catch up to him. Once my clone is destroyed, it'll be even harder to catch up!" "Alright, we know!"“……”At this moment, it was Li Hao's turn to worry. Did they overrelax after hearing what I said?Forget it, who cares!As long as he didn't die, he would torture him to death!"Then I'll absorb the longevity sword intent first. The sword intent here is rich, and I can absorb the sword intent that can kill me once every three days ... You guys, once every three days, can you accept it?""Sure!""Alright, we'll come!"Li Hao said no more and continued to absorb sword intent. He could use this sword intent as a trump card to kill a Heavenly King.However, an outsider was still an outsider!I want to analyze the path of the sword venerable and the longevity sword intent, turning them into my own. This is the true improvement in essence.……Starting from today, Li Hao had to commit suicide every three days.He used the longevity sword intent to commit suicide!In the midst of death, he sought enlightenment and opportunities.Every time he died and was resurrected, his lifespan was reduced, but Li Hao didn't care about that. If he failed, he would only have three years to live, and the seal would be broken in three years!He had a long lifespan. If he succeeded, the stronger he was, the longer his lifespan would be. Who would care about this little loss?……Just as Li Hao was experiencing death ...It had been three months since Li Hao left the haoxing continent!Summer passed and autumn came. It was autumn now.Three months was also a huge change for the bright star continent. Millions of superpowers were constantly developing the entire continent, and with almost all the enemies wiped out, the world of Silvermoon welcomed its most prosperous era.There had never been so many superpowers and martial masters active in all fields.It had been almost a year since Li Hao launched literacy education. Such a long time was enough for a large number of people to break away from the ranks of literacy.
