Chapter 236: The master and disciple set up a new plan (5)
Translator: 549690339
In some people’s eyes, Li Hao’s death was nothing!

He didn’t need to tell Li Hao about this.

His old friends might not do that, but he had to be on guard against Yuan Shuo.

The master and disciple sighed again!

“If there’s really no other way,” Yuan Shuo suddenly said,”then we’ll look for Hao lianchuan!”

Li Hao was stunned. Didn’t she say that she wasn’t looking?

“There’s no other way. The night patrolmen are still upright officials. Even if they’re tempted, they’ll at least go through the process and won’t kill you directly ... They’ll at least discuss with you and see if you can pay the price to take them down ... They’re a little pedantic!”

He said that he was pedantic, but in the next moment, he said in a self-deprecating manner,””But it is also because of this pedantic nature that if you really encounter a problem, you can still find the night patrolman at the first moment. The best among the dwarves is the best. At least the night patrolman is more reliable than the others. ”

This was the key.

He had no choice!

Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice,”rather than making a big deal out of it and attracting the attention of the Yama and the other large organizations, why don’t we pay the price and get the night patrols to make a move?!” Even if the remains are taken away by them, the night patrolmen won’t say that they’ll kill you to open the remains, but they’ll at least think of something ...”

Li Hao scratched his head again.”You want to kill me?”

“It’s hard to say,”

“It’s best if I don’t have to kill you,”Yuan Shuo said with a smile.” Even if the night patrollers get the remains, they probably won’t do anything to you. Kid, think about it. Do you want to ask the night patrolmen for help, or do you want to take the risk?”

His gaze was a little dangerous.”I can try. I’ll ambush Qiao Feilong first. If I can successfully kill him, I’ll still have the strength to fight. Then, I’ll go to the mine and kill those few glorious sun Warriors and silence the others ...”

It was extremely risky!

Li Hao immediately shook his head without thinking.”Why don’t we ask the night patrolman for help...Right, teacher, I...Can I provide Captain Liu with some swordsmanship? Maybe he can step into the thousand warrior class?”

What if Liu Long had also stepped into the warrior tide?

Douqian was not inferior to some of the sunlit, and was even stronger.

It was actually very difficult for a Martial Master to win against a superhuman below the warrior dimension. However, once a warrior reached the warrior dimension and had the divine decree, sunlight was often no match for a warrior Dimension Master.

“He didn’t grasp force!”

“If he has grasped force, you can still give him the sword. There’s still a chance for him to advance before you exhaust it. But the problem is that this fellow doesn’t have enough control over force!” Yuan Shuo frowned.

Liu Long was more reliable than Hao lianchuan.

Unfortunately, he was a little weak.

Li Hao also frowned.”Force ... I don’t know if the captain has any insights after I talked to him last time. If he can understand force, coupled with sword energy, he can advance to the Qian warrior realm. Then, it will be much easier!”

At this point, Li Hao exhaled.”Teacher, I’ll go to the captain first to test his words. If the captain can advance to the thousand warrior class ... It might not be safe!” If it doesn’t work, we can call that Minister Qin...In short, if we can get rid of the Qiao ‘s, it’s fine even if some things are exposed. At worst, we can just give up on this remains!”

He was still very open-minded.

It wasn’t his style to value money over his life.

Mrs. Qiao is likely to have her eyes on him.

After the rainy night, his identity as the descendant of Li Hao’s eight great families had been exposed. Before that, perhaps only red Moon had used some methods to lock onto him, but Mrs. Qiao probably didn’t know about this.

Yuan Shuo nodded, and finally said,”little Hao, an outsider is an outsider. You can’t delay your own cultivation!” I’m currently changing the five elements “mysterious energy. When I get it, you can cultivate it quickly and advance quickly!”

Li Hao’s progress wasn’t slow, and he soon broke through 100.

However, during this period, Li Hao’s development was slower than others. The supers in his early years had already trained for 20 years.

It would be very difficult to catch up.

He had to do everything he could to advance as soon as possible in order to gain a firm foothold in this increasingly chaotic world.

Li Hao laughed.”Don’t worry, teacher. I’ve been absorbing the power of the red shadow these days. I’ve made some progress. I don’t need the second-layered force anymore. I can already release my internal force!” He can release inner strength from his four limbs. Now, he can also release inner strength from both his hands. He’s still improving rapidly. ”

He did not slack off, nor did he delay his cultivation.

The early stage of breaking through 100 meant that the inner strength could be released from all four limbs. He had already achieved the ability to release the inner strength from both arms. Of course, the red shadow technique was indispensable.

But now, the red shadow’s power was almost exhausted.

Next, if Li Hao wanted to improve quickly, he had to obtain more benefits as soon as possible. He didn’t know how long it would take for his teacher to exchange mysterious energy.

“Both arms are fine?”

Yuan Shuo was also speechless. That was fast.

Although he still looked like he was in the early 100th stage, or even not at the peak of the early stage, he could at least extend his limbs.

More importantly, how many days had it been?

At this rate, with the red shadow’s full strength, this kid might be able to reach the level of limb extension in half a month.

“It’s good that you didn’t relax!”

Yuan Shuo nodded and continued.”You can practice the” nine forms force “more before you make any major progress. You’re only at the third-fold force now, right?”

“Yes.”

“Trash!”

Yuan Shuo scolded,”this dog of yours, from what I saw earlier, he could already use triple layered force!” Breaking through 100 usually starts with four-fold force!”

Li Hao was speechless.

Teacher, you seem to be scolding me.

‘You dog’ sounds like he’s scolding me.

On the side, seeing that Yuan Shuo was talking about him, as if to show off or show off his usefulness, the Black Panther suddenly clawed at Li Hao, producing three afterimages of its paw!

Chapter 237: The master and disciple set up a new plan (6)
Translator: 549690339
Not only that, even the fourth time could be faintly seen.

Li Hao was stunned.

This was almost the fourth-fold force?

“Teacher, Black Panther slashed the peak of the tenth realm?”

‘Ten decapitation realm can only last three times at most, and one can only last more than three times after breaking through 100. This dog ... Has become more powerful again?’

Yuan Shuo laughed and nodded,” This dog, I think it’s fast for him to break through 100, but once he breaks through 100, he should slow down. You idiot, it drank the soup from the head. Since the sword has been sealed for so many years, the soup from the head must be more effective, and it might even have some special abilities. But you were taken advantage of by a dog!”

He couldn’t help but curse.

The Jade sword’s energy was diluted for the first time, so the effect must have been excellent. Unfortunately, it was all drunk by the Black Panther. Li Hao only drank the sword-soaking water for the second time.

Li Hao, however, was in a good mood and was very optimistic.””Teacher, it’s different! If it wasn’t for Black Panther, I wouldn’t have discovered this. Perhaps I wouldn’t have been able to discover the special use of the Jade sword. At that time, my teacher was still over a hundred while I was just an ordinary person. Perhaps we would have died last time. ”

Without the Black Panther’s discovery, Li Hao wouldn’t have known about the Jade sword energy.

If he didn’t know, Yuan Shuo wouldn’t teach him the breathing technique of five birds, because he hadn’t even entered the tenth realm, so it would be a waste to teach him!

If that was the case, Yuan Shuo would not be able to enter the warrior tide ...

One drink, one Peck, whoever said the right thing would take advantage of who?

At the side, the Black Panther hurriedly raised its head as if showing off that it was the one who had discovered the Jade sword’s uniqueness. Hurry up and praise this dog!

Li Hao smiled and kicked it. “”It’s better to break through 100 realms early. Slashing Ten Realms isn’t enough! I was counting on you to help me, but it turned out to be of no use. ”

“Aowu!”

The Black Panther was a little dejected. It was already very powerful, but the people Li Hao met were getting more and more powerful. There was nothing it could do.

After chatting with Yuan Shuo for a while and confirming that he would make the first move, Li Hao left in a hurry.

Go find the captain!

He wanted to take advantage of this opportunity and use the name of the other party colluding with the Yama to quietly get rid of the Qiao family without alerting anyone.

As for whether the Qiao family wanted to make a move on him ... Who cared!

Li Hao didn’t think too much about it. Qiao Feilong had a hidden superpower that wasn’t reported. Even if he was a good person, he could just kill him ... But in reality, he couldn’t be a good person.

……

After Li Hao left, Yuan Shuo’s smile disappeared.

He sighed.

Damn it!

I’ve already entered the thousand warrior stage, and I can even fight with the three suns. However, the trouble that this bastard has attracted is getting bigger and bigger. It’s already very difficult for me to improve in the Silver City. It seems that I have to go to the central region.

If a Martial Master didn’t improve in battle, he would eventually become ordinary.

He was able to advance to the thousand warrior tier because he had broken through the hundred stage. He had swept the world and fought countless battles.

But now, his Foundation had been exhausted.

“Silver City is not a place to stay for long ... Even if there is another battle, there is a high probability that it will only be at the three yang level ...”

Above the three yang!

Yuan Shuo was even more eager to see this level. Not only that, but he also wanted to go to the central region and see the other martial masters.

He was the number one Martial Master in Silvermoon province, but that didn’t mean there were no other powerful martial masters in the world.

When he broke 100, he was only able to run wild in Silver Moon province.

After leaving the Silver Moon province, there were already warrior Qian Masters outside. After all these years, he didn’t know if these people were still alive or if they were still running amuck.

The chances of survival were very high!

After all, the warrior of thousand Warriors was comparable to the sun glory in the past. At that time, the power had just risen, and it was a big threat to those who broke through 100. However, it was not much of a threat to the warrior of thousand Warriors. On the contrary, they could absorb mysterious energy, and some of them might have even walked a stronger path.

“I’ll be leaving now that I’ve successfully settled the matters here!”

Yuan Shuo sighed. He was a little worried about Li Hao, but if he didn’t leave, he would only become weaker and weaker if he stayed here. The development of superpowers was too fast.

In the next moment, Yuan Shuo’s fighting spirit was lifted!

Then let’s use the Qiao family as a test!

“Qiao Feilong ... I’ve underestimated you!”

Qiao Feilong’s Smiling Tiger face appeared in his mind. He had never seen it before.


Chapter 238: The common point of martial masters (1)

At the law enforcement building.

When Li Hao and Wang Ming returned to the night patrolman’s station, they quickly went to Liu Long’s office.

Report the progress of today’s work.

……

In the office.

Liu Long frowned as he leaned back in his chair, deep in thought.

“Come in!” He shouted when he heard the commotion.

The two of them pushed the door open and entered.

Liu Long was a little absent-minded. He glanced at the two of them and said in a depressed tone,”Are you done running?”

Wang Ming quickly said,”I’ve gone to half of the martial arts schools. I’ve gone to the Silver City ancient Academy, the Galaxy group, and Qiao’s mining company. There are still a few that I haven’t gone to, so I’m going to go tomorrow. It’s too late today.”

Liu Long slightly nodded.

“Are there superpowers outside of the staff?”

It wasn’t as if all the supers and martial masters had not been registered. Liu Long actually had a list of names provided by the inspection Office.

This time, the main purpose was to register the transcendents who were not listed.

“There are!”

Li Hao said,”a few more martial masters and supers were registered today. However, their strength is average. They are only ten-slash realm and Starlight master.”

As for the one from the Galaxy group who broke 100, there was a record.

This was not considered a supernumerary transcendence.

As for Qiao’s mining company, only three Starlight Masters were registered, and no more people were registered. It was not worth mentioning if there were less than a hundred people and Yue Ming. Liu Long would naturally check the records later.

“Hmph!”

“I don’t believe that with the development of superpowers and the increase in the number of dark moons, each clan doesn’t even have a single Dark Moon!” Liu Long scoffed.

This wasn’t ten years ago!

Or rather, even three years ago, Dark Moon was a rare sight. However, in the recent three years, after the war broke out, superpowers developed rapidly.

It was not rare to see a Dark Moon super.

Although Silver City was small, the major corporations were not short of money. In this era, even transcendents would sometimes have to work for others for money.

The major corporations didn’t even recruit a moon Hades master?

Who are you trying to fool?

“You still think that this is the same as before?”

Liu Long’s face was cold. He was an arrogant person. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been dissatisfied with Li Hao the first time he saw him. Li Hao didn’t go through the law-enforcement team, but directly contacted Yuan Shuo to inform the law-enforcement team.

In Liu Long’s eyes, the dignity of the Inspector General had to be maintained.

In the end, these people obviously didn’t give him any face.

They didn’t even register the establishment of the branch, what a bunch of lies!

Wang Ming was a little more tolerant than him, or perhaps it could be said that he had seen this a lot in white moon City. At this moment, he consoled,”Minister, it’s normal! Even in white moon City, this kind of deception often happens. As long as you don’t cause trouble ... I don’t think it’s unacceptable. ”

Liu Long said coldly,”therefore, the night patrolmen of white moon City have no authority in the entire Silvermoon province!” Otherwise, who would dare to be so presumptuous?”

Wang Ming was embarrassed.

There were some things that he could not say.

Besides, the night patrolman had his own difficulties. However, as a young man, he also felt aggrieved. After hearing Liu Long’s words, he could only remain silent.

“Boss!”

Li Hao interjected,”it can’t be helped. It’s said that there are very few night patrols in the central region. We have to keep a low profile in the border provinces. Otherwise, no one will support us if something happens ... I think the higher-ups have the same consideration.”

“Li Hao!”

Even Liu Long was shocked!

You, this fellow, now that you’re an official, why do you have the same tone as your superiors?

It wasn’t like this before!

Previously, when they talked about the night patrols, everyone was very dissatisfied. They felt that the night patrols didn’t give much help to the Silver city’s problems.

Good fellow, I gave you a promotion and you betrayed me?

On the side, even Wang Ming was a little contemptuous.

This guy was really an expert at changing sides with the wind.

Shameless!

“Boss, have you forgotten that We Are The Night patrollers?” Li Hao said with a smile.

If he scolded the night patrolman again, he would be scolding himself.

“Boss, if you really become a Night Watcher, protecting the dignity of the night watchers is equivalent to protecting our own dignity. If we scold them every day, it’s equivalent to denying ourselves. In that case, why set up a branch of the night watchers?”

Liu Long was stunned and didn’t quite understand.

He was used to his previous life.

I’m really not used to the changes. Li Hao is right, we’re already night patrols.

He kept saying that the night patrollers were useless, but he was actually talking about himself.

If he did not have a sense of honor and could not integrate into the night patrolman system, how could he make the night patrolman stand up and gain the respect and fear of others?

“Yeah ... We’re the night patrollers now!”

Liu Long sighed and waved his hand, ready to send them away.

Wang Ming didn’t stand on ceremony and turned to leave.

Seeing that Li Hao didn’t move, he was a little surprised. He turned to look at Li Hao, who smiled and said in a low voice,””I still have something else to report.”

After saying that, he winked.

Wang Ming understood!

The tenth person!

It seemed that Li Hao was going to report the matter of the tenth person alone. He couldn’t get involved in this matter. Forget it, he wouldn’t ask too much, in case he betrayed Li Hao.

He left quickly without asking anything and was very cooperative.

……

Wang Ming left.

“Is there anything else?” Liu Long frowned.

“Boss, we’ve discovered some hidden experts.”

“You discovered it?” Liu Long was a little surprised.

“No, Wang Ming and I discovered it together. He has some special abilities ...”

Liu Long looked at him suspiciously. Really?

They didn’t know how to say it themselves, so why did they let you report it?

“Wang Ming doesn’t want to say it, but that guy is very tsundere and thinks he’s from white moon City, so he doesn’t want to deal with a bumpkin like boss!”

“……”

Liu Long became suspicious again and said in a low voice,””You didn’t make it up, did you?”


Chapter 239: Common ground of martial masters (2)
Translator: 549690339
Sometimes, he felt that Li Hao was full of bad ideas and wasn’t a good person. Sometimes, he felt that Li Hao was simple and reliable, complicated, and perverted.

Li Hao grinned and didn’t say much.

Liu Long cursed in his heart!

It was definitely made up by the kid.

“Speak,” he said.

“Boss, I’ll ask you something first. If the Yama and Crimson Moon have strongholds, will we eliminate them?”

“Of course!”

Liu Long said coldly,”not all of the three great organizations are bad people … However, those who are still in Silver City are definitely bad people!” Punish the evil, have you forgotten the purpose of our demon hunting mission?”

Li Hao actually doubted this!

“Protect justice!”

Li Hao nodded with a serious expression.”Uphold justice! Maintain peace! Slay demons! Our demon-hunting spirit will never be extinguished!”

“Tell me, did you discover the whereabouts of the three major organizations?” Liu Long asked, relieved.

“Yes.”

“Yama’s branch!”Li Hao nodded.

“It’s not the Crimson Moon?”

“No, it’s the Yama branch. Sister Liu said it’s the Qiao ‘s!”

Liu Long’s eyes moved slightly, but he didn’t say anything.

When Li Hao mentioned Mrs. Qiao, he had guessed that it must be related to Liu Yan, because he knew her situation. He slightly frowned.”Are you sure? Liu Yan had such a guess before, and even I had such a guess, but there was no evidence to prove it. You have to know that we are just, but … That doesn’t mean that we can be punished without punishment!”

He still had a righteous heart.

Killing required some basic evidence and logic. Without any evidence, one could not kill indiscriminately. If that was the case, what difference would there be between them and those supers who killed the innocent?

Therefore, even though Liu Yan had said that there might be a problem with the Qiao ‘s, he had secretly investigated but didn’t find anything. In the end, he gave up.

He even sneaked into the Qiao family’s residence at night and stood beside old master Qiao, silently observing and keeping an eye on him. This situation continued for several days until he was sure that there were no problems, then he gave up on investigating the Qiao family.

The death of Liu Yan’s husband could only be attributed to an accident. Of course, the murderer had always been on the wanted list.

Li Hao laughed.”I don’t need any evidence. Just one point: Qiao Feilong is an expert, and he has a few hidden experts. Is this enough?”

“You’re joking!”

Liu Long chuckled.”Ten decapitation … No, if someone in the ten decapitation realm who hasn’t practiced martial arts for more than ten years can be considered a strong practitioner, then I can’t refute your words. Qiao Feilong, I understand you too well!”

“Boss, you understand?”

“Of course!”

“Let’s put it this way, I’ve seen every part of his body!”Liu Long laughed.

“……”

Li Hao was shocked!

This … You guys actually …

He was a little shocked. Then, could he not say it?

“I once stared at him for a few days in the dark, right by his bed …”

“Boss!”

At this moment, Li Hao finally understood. He was shocked. “It’s great that you’re still alive!”

‘Oh my God.’

You’ve followed a Third Sun and even watched from his bed for a few days, yet you’re still alive … It can only be said that in order to hide, Qiao Feilong had also braced himself to be seen by you.

Otherwise, I would have slapped you to death long ago.

You’re over a hundred, but you’re staring at a three yang every day. You even look at him peeing … You’re really perverted.

“What do you mean?”

Liu Long frowned,”you’re saying that he’s hiding his strength?” It’s impossible!”

He wasn’t stupid and understood what she meant.”He doesn’t have any superpower fluctuations. As for the Martial Master realm, although it’s hard to see, I can see something from the toughness and luster of his skin. Although it’s not too specific, I can still make a guess.”

He believed that he would not be mistaken.

“Three suns!” Li Hao said in a deep voice.

“……”

Liu Long was stunned. He looked at Li Hao in a daze and said in a daze after a long while,””What?”

“Three suns!”

“Oh …”

Liu Long was in a daze for a moment, and only came back to his senses after a while.

He stood up in a daze. After a long time, he looked at Li Hao, hesitating to say something.

“My teacher has confirmed it!”

Li Hao knew what answer he wanted and quickly gave it to him.

With Yuan Shuo’s support, Liu Long instantly understood that this was true.

He could suspect Li Hao, but he didn’t need to suspect Yuan Shuo. If Yuan Shuo said so, then it must be.

Three suns!

He was a little dazed. The Silver City had three suns, and they were the Silver City’s own three suns.

Yes, if Qiao Feilong was a three Sun Expert, then he would be the number one expert in Silver City.

He, Liu Long, had always been worried that the Silver City would migrate. He had always thought that the Silver City wouldn’t be able to gain a firm foothold without an expert. But now, he finally knew that the Silver City actually had an expert.

It was a pity that the other party had not stood up when the Silver City was in danger.

They were not there when the Crimson Moon came.

He wasn’t around when the other superpowers committed crimes.

Qiao Feilong!

As for him, a three yang, he had always hidden his identity. Even when he had monitored him, he had not revealed a single thing.

The death of Liu Yan’s husband must be related to Mrs. Qiao.

After a long time, Liu Long took a deep breath and said in a self-deprecating manner,””And here I was, thinking that I was the number one expert of the Silver City. In the end, first it was Yuan Shuo, and then it was him … What a joke.”

“My teacher is different!”

“I promise,” Li Hao said in a deep voice.”My teacher will advance a few days ago. It’s also the day I enter the tenth slash realm. He’s not deliberately hiding it!”

Liu Long’s expression changed.

Is that true?

He had always thought that Yuan Shuo had long advanced in rank, but he had been hiding it.


Chapter 240: Common ground of martial masters (3)
Translator: 549690339
“Before this, I’m afraid teacher wasn’t even as strong as you, boss!”

Li Hao knew that Liu Long had a knot in his heart. He even suspected that his teacher knew about Xiao Yuan’s death but didn’t interfere until something happened to him.

It wasn’t like this!

Li Hao said solemnly,”I won’t hide it!” ‘If my teacher was a Qian warrior when Xiao Yuan died and didn’t care about it … I wouldn’t have maintained this relationship with my teacher. I would hate him, not admire him!’ As for me, I admire my teacher because if my teacher was a warrior of the thousand worlds, I’m afraid he would have killed him long ago. Do you believe what I said, boss?”

“I do!”

Liu Long nodded.

He took a deep breath and regained his composure.””Three suns … Interesting, it’s related to the Yama.”

He thought for a moment and said,”I’ll report this to the higher-ups and see if we can get Minister ke to come. I’m afraid that hou bu can’t leave white moon City. Since he’s hiding his identity, whether it’s public or private, we have to kill him!”

That’s right, this person actually gave the same answer.

Whether it was Liu Long or Yuan Shuo.

These martial masters were sometimes really dark and vicious.

They didn’t need any other evidence or words. When Li Hao said that the other party was three suns and had been hiding, they only had one thought-to strike first and kill him first. They wouldn’t kill the wrong person!

If he really killed the wrong person … That would be the other party’s responsibility. Who asked him to hide his strength?

An expert who couldn’t help the Silver City in any way, an expert who didn’t care about the Silver City’s troubles, if he died, then so be it. Liu Long and the others wouldn’t regret it at all.

Li Hao was silent for a while. Then he said,”if you can kill them yourself, I’ll give one three suns and over a thousand Fang Shen secret abilities to the team, boss, and the others, including the three sunlit experts, if you don’t want them!”

Liu Long’s eyes widened!

At this moment, he understood Li Hao’s meaning. First, the other side still had three sunlit cultivators.

Second, he had communicated with Yuan Shuo and wanted to assassinate him!

Hogging all the benefits!

Of course, it was definitely not that simple. There were some things that were involved, and he quickly thought about it …

Before he could figure it out, Li Hao said in a low voice,””He’s in control of a relic … It might be a relic! It’s very likely to be my Li family ‘s, so my teacher and I want this. We can’t let too many people know. ”

“You’re telling me?”

Liu Long’s teeth ached.

When Li Hao said that he would kill him alone, he knew that there was a problem.

He didn’t expect Li Hao to be so straightforward.

A relic!

A relic that belonged to the eight great families … He now understood Li Hao’s meaning.

Li Hao nodded,”boss is trustworthy!” I trust my teacher the most in Silver City, and the second is boss. ”

“Hehe!”

Liu Long sneered,”forget it, I don’t need it. You can play by yourself. Don’t kill me. I still want to live for a few more years. What kind of strength do I have?” Over a hundred! One three suns is fine, but you said there are three sunlit … Li Hao, are you being too arrogant?”

He was really floating!

Solo kill?

Do you expect me to join hands with your teacher?

Bah!

If I go up, I’ll be beaten to death.

Li Hao thought for a moment and said,”fire!” The mine outside the city is bombarding, but this won’t have a big impact, so I’ve considered the problem of the three sunlit people. If they dare, we can directly use weapons of mass destruction!”

Li Hao chuckled.”The name is simple. Colluding with the Crimson Moon … Don’t even mention the Yama!” Don’t even mention it. Since we’ve already offended Red Moon, there’s no need to be afraid of offending more. Yama won’t admit it on his own. They’ve planted people in the Silver City, so they can only suffer in silence. ”

“Boss, can firearms kill sunlight?”

Liu Long fell into deep thought and said after a long while, “There’s a slight possibility that we’ll be caught off guard, but there’s actually some aura in the sun glory realm. It’s hard to explain aura clearly, but crisis perception is one of them.”

“Their speed is too fast. If they are good at other superpowers such as earth escape, they would have escaped in an instant. The effect of the cannon is limited.”

“Of course, if he’s hit by a Cannonball, he might not necessarily die, but he’ll definitely be seriously injured …”

The sensing ability of sunlight was quite powerful.

The Cannonball was fast, but not to the point that sunlight couldn’t Dodge it.

This was also one of the limitations of firearms.

Of course, if it was a weapon of mass destruction with an extremely large area of effect, it could directly cover dozens of miles. Even if it was sunlight, it would be difficult to escape in an instant.

A weapon of this scale would only appear on a battlefield where both sides suffered heavy losses and died.

Otherwise, no one would have an advantage.

For example, in the central region, a battle like this had broken out. The night patrolmen had directly activated a city-destroying weapon and razed a tall mountain to the ground. The premise was that the location was suitable. Otherwise, if the battle was fought within the city, countless people would be buried with it.

“Boss,” Li Hao said after a moment of silence,”if you advance to the warrior Qian level, are you confident in dealing with three sunlit Warriors?”

“Look at their cultivation, they’re at the intermediate stage or something … If all martial masters are as strong as your teacher, then there’s no doubt that they’ll be able to do it. The point is, not everyone is like your teacher.”

Even though he had advanced to the combat thousands stage, he did not feel that he was stronger than Yuan Shuo.

Moreover, he was unable to advance.

“Boss, have you comprehended Shi?”

Liu Long furrowed his brows slightly,”No… But I have some clues!” “However, I had a powerful outburst the last time and my arms are quite badly injured. I haven’t had the chance to try it out, and my qi and blood are also a little damaged … I’m afraid I’ll need some time to recuperate.”

Previously, in order to deal with the red shadow, his qi and blood had been boiling and evaporating. He only delayed it because he had a strength of over 100. Otherwise, he would have been crippled long ago.


Chapter 241: The common points of martial masters (4)
Translator: 549690339
In fact, Li Hao didn’t even know that his injuries were very serious, because Liu Long really didn’t show it.

Seeing that Li Hao wanted him to fight, Liu Long explained the situation to prevent Li Hao from making a wrong judgment. That would be a big problem. In his current condition, he could deal with an ordinary cultivator who had a cultivation base above 100, but he was most likely no match for a full moon or full moon cultivator.

“You have a clue?”

Li Hao didn’t care about his injuries. Instead, he hurriedly asked.

Liu Long nodded his head slightly,”the ninth form. I’ve done some research. The first fold of the ninth form is stronger than the first fold!” The source is actually very clear, wave!”

Liu Long had taught Li Hao nine forms of internal energy, so he didn’t hide it from him.”Have you ever seen the sea?”

Li Hao shook his head.

Silver City had no sea!

“Then if you want to see it, there’s one near White moon City. I’ve seen the sea.”

Liu Long recalled,”on the beach, when the waves come, there will be small waves at first, then the waves behind will push the waves in front. Every wave is about the same. However, when the two waves overlap, it will produce a more powerful destructive force! When multiple waves overlap, they can even create a tsunami … That’s the might of the heavens!”

Liu Long was a little scared,”I’ve seen it once before, a wave that was over a hundred meters tall!” “Originally, it was just an ordinary wave, but with the help of the wind, it’s like our blood is flowing. The inner strength is superimposed, and a series of waves are superimposed … That time, a wave of over a hundred meters was set off, directly smashing a Boulder into pieces and sweeping across the entire beach.”

“At that time, I was still in the tenth realm, but I felt that I couldn’t survive in that kind of environment.”

Liu Long sighed,”when your teacher talked about” Shi,”I thought of the” Shi “from that day!” That’s right, the ocean waves were monstrous and had the power to destroy everything! I wanted to imitate the overlapping waves and break through them like a hot knife through butter … Unfortunately, my body doesn’t allow me to do that!”

He shook his head and said,”I’ve never used the nine-layered technique because my body doesn’t allow it. But now I’m thinking if I use the nine-layered technique, will I be able to sense the nine-fold force?” It’s a pity that I realized it a little too late. ”

He was a little regretful.”But I’d like to try. I’ll recuperate for a while. Perhaps I can use the mysterious energy to recover.” Li Hao, you have to remember that when you can do nine ghost layers, you’d better go see the real ocean and see the real waves!”

“Can you complete the double-overlap now?” he asked.

He had never asked about it, but he felt that the chances were not high. Li Hao had only been exposed to the ninth-forging force for a short time.

Li Hao grinned!

Liu Long was startled.”Can I?”

Li Hao didn’t say anything. He just punched out, and his internal strength was stacked. Almost instantly, two layers of explosive power burst out. He didn’t use any internal strength, but just simply punched out.

Bang! Bang!

With a soft sound, Liu Long also made his move and grabbed his fist. However, his fist trembled slightly and his body swayed a little.

“You’ve learned it?”he was a little shocked.

Did he really learn the double overlapping?

It was too fast!

As for the dog, he quickly did three ghost images. Liu Long didn’t pay too much attention to it. A dog that was about to become a spirit was still a very demonic existence.

But Li Hao was a living person!

He learned it so quickly?

Li Hao smiled. Do you want me to triple it?

Forget it, I’m afraid Captain will be scared to death.

At this moment, one more [level 100 +] and one more [triple layer] didn’t have much of an impact on the battle, or Li Hao would have said the same thing.

However, the impact wasn’t big … It didn’t matter if he told her or not.

“A genius!”

This time, Liu Long was really sincere in his praise,”you can actually use the double overlapping, that means … You’ve reached the late stage of the tenth severing realm … This … Is too fast!”

The maximum number of slashes for the tenth realm was three layers.

Li Hao was able to do the double overlap without much pressure. Clearly, he was in the middle to late stages.

“Boss, that’s not important.”

“It’s very important!”

“It really isn’t important.”

“Boss,” Li Hao said in a deep voice,”my teacher has a treasure that can help heal people. It has a special effect. If your injuries are healed, do you have any hope of advancing to the warrior Qian stage?”

“My injuries are not ordinary …” Liu Long frowned.

“Is it more serious than my teacher’s injury? His heart was almost pierced through. ”

“……”

She was speechless.

At this moment, he remembered.

That’s right, Yuan Shuo’s heart had been broken back then. In the end, he had actually recovered and even advanced in rank. Everyone had thought that he had some special means or that he had slowly recuperated.

Now that he heard it, it was the effect of the treasure?

“If your teacher’s heart injury can be healed, so can I, but …”

“No buts!”

Li Hao said solemnly,”as long as boss says that you are confident in advancing to the Qian warrior level, I can call my teacher to protect you and help you heal. With two Qian Warriors, it’s time to let people know that the Silver City’s Nightwatchers are powerful!” We’ll kill the chicken to warn the monkeys!”

This guy was more like a Minister than he was.

Liu Long muttered in his heart. He then looked at the serious Li Hao and slightly hesitated.

Li Hao said in a deep voice,”boss, Martial Master, when you enter the Qian dynasty, you must press forward with indomitable will!” It’s impossible to succeed if you’re overcautious and indecisive. This is what my teacher said, and I’ll take it as a wise saying. I’ll give this to boss too!”

“Press forward with indomitable will …”

Liu Long’s eyes flickered, and in the next moment, he raised his eyebrows slightly,”If I can successfully heal my injuries, I’m confident! My physical fitness has actually met the requirements. After all, I’ve absorbed a lot of mysterious energy. What I’m lacking is the comprehension of force, as well as my old injuries, so I can’t use my full strength. ”

“If I can recover from my injuries … And if your teacher is willing to guide me at the critical moment, I will definitely be able to advance to the Qian warrior realm!”

Chapter 242: The common points of martial masters
Translator: 549690339
At this moment, he was suddenly bursting with confidence!

Li Hao wasn’t making things up. For a Martial Master, stepping into the universe of fighters was an indomitable will. If one didn’t think that there was much hope … Then there was really no hope, because one’s Shi would never be successfully established.

He thought of the waves that day.

All-conquering!

It was originally just water, extremely soft and gentle, but at that moment, it was like a cannonball, pressing forward with indomitable will and never retreating. Once it retreated, the momentum of the waves would dissipate and return to the sea, turning back into soft water.

At this moment, Li Hao suddenly laughed.”Boss, if you can enter the Qian warrior realm … That day, my teacher entered the Qian warrior realm and guided me to the tenth severing realm with force. You and I both cultivate the ninth refinement force. Perhaps this time, boss’s advancement will be of help to me. This is a win-win situation.”

“If I improve, I think my teacher wouldn’t mind putting in more effort. After all, I’m his last disciple!”

He cultivated the five birds technique together with Yuan Shuo and the ninth refinement force together with Liu Long.

As a result, Li Hao could sense and guide both forces. As for the others, they were not martial masters, so they could sense a thing or two, but it wouldn’t be of much help.

Therefore, this was not a lie.

Li Hao felt that Liu Long’s success would be of great help to him when he stepped into the thousand warrior realm in the future. To him, it was a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity to comprehend two kinds of thousand warrior power in advance.

Liu Long’s expression was solemn,”I have not accepted any inheritors. The ninth refinement technique was almost lost in my generation!” You’ve already learned the second-tier power…It’s not convenient for me to take you in as my disciple, but you’re indeed the Liu family’s descendant! If you can advance to the warrior power stage, I will not hide the ninth-refinement force from you. ”

He didn’t have a successor!

And now, Li Hao was the Liu family’s martial arts inheritor. Since he was the inheritor, he should let him experience the power of the ninth-form force.

He added,”also, if my injuries are healed, I can advance to the thousand-man combat stage … When I said that I was no match for your teacher, I was just saying that I was injured!” Also, I’m not as well-rounded as your teacher, but the explosive power of my ninth-refinement force is something your teacher can’t compare to!”

He was suddenly filled with confidence,”nine-fold force, nine-fold in one go!” “When your teacher killed the three suns, he might have used some powerful extraordinary items, but I … Might not need them! I’m confident that I can break through the three suns “defense. Of course, I’m inferior to your teacher in other aspects.”

He didn’t mind exposing his shortcomings, but he didn’t want his family technique to be looked down upon, especially by Li Hao.

Li Hao had inherited two cultivation techniques at the same time. He wanted to tell Li Hao that although his teacher was strong, he was strong in all aspects.

And I, Liu Long, am strong in my attacks!

Li Hao’s eyes flickered. Break through the three-sun defense?

Really?

On second thought, it might be true.

After all, nine-folds of the ninth-refinement force might not be much worse than a saber. It was true that his teacher was all-rounded, and the five birds technique was all-rounded, but his teacher had also said that he wanted to practice the ninth-refinement force to have an extremely strong explosive power!

Of course, Yuan Shuo had never mentioned that he wanted to learn it.

Martial masters placed great importance on these inheritances. Even if they knew that both sides complemented each other and would become stronger after learning it, they would not rashly learn other people’s cultivation techniques.

“Boss, why don’t we try it?”

Li Hao was interested and excited.””As long as we succeed this time, not to mention boss, if we kill the other party, even if it’s just to strip the mysterious power, in our team, sister Liu, Chen Jian, and Wu Chao all have hope of stepping into the realm of superpowers! With more than 1000 cubic meters and three sunlit experts … It’s even possible to extract 2000 cubic meters of mysterious energy. ”

Killing people to seize the mysterious energy was the stupidest move.

However, to poor people like them, this was the most direct and straightforward way. 2000 cubic meters of mysterious energy was an astronomical sum to them.

At this moment, Li Hao quickly calculated.

The teacher would deal with Qiao Feilong, and the captain would deal with the three sunlit Warriors … They weren’t going to deal with them alone. Li Hao even thought that it would be best if everyone moved out together and used firearms to suppress them first. It would be best if they could injure the other party.

When the other party was fleeing, they were the easiest to kill.

If he succeeded, the strength of the entire Silver city’s night patrollers would greatly increase.

As for using firearms, it wasn’t a big problem. As long as they got rid of these people before other powerhouses sensed it, no matter how many firearms were used, no one would care too much. Moreover, people who could be killed by firearms wouldn’t think too much about it.

The truly strong would not be killed by firearms unless the time and place were similar.

At this moment, Liu Long also felt a surge of emotions.

Kill three suns, kill sunlight!

Dou Qian!

His mouth was dry, and he glanced at Li Hao, feeling a little dazed.

A few days ago, he felt that it was extremely difficult to kill Yueming.

But now, this kid was inviting him to kill sunlight and three suns. Am I crazy or is this guy crazy?

Sure enough, just as Liu Yan and the others had said, Li Hao was an extremely perverted guy.

“How about this, give me three days!” He said.

Liu Long said in a deep voice,”if I can successfully advance in rank within three days … We’ll think of a way to kill them all by ourselves!” ‘If I can’t and can’t delay, Qiao Feilong must have a goal. I can’t let him do as he pleases. If I can’t advance successfully in three days, I’ll look for Minister kui!’ Of course, you have your concerns, and I understand that. But Li Hao, you have to remember one thing. If you have the life to take it, it’s yours. If you don’t … Then nothing will be yours. ”

These words were exactly the same as Yuan Shuo ‘s.


Chapter 243: Common points of martial masters (6)
Translator: 549690339
At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt that the thinking of martial masters was actually very similar.

If Liu Long wasn’t in the inspection Office, he would be a devil in the outside world.

However, martial masters had strong self-control. They gained strength step by step and did not lose themselves because of great strength. They knew what they wanted and what they wanted.

Li Hao compared martial masters and supers. The biggest difference between the two was their faith!

He realized that a Martial master’s conviction was perhaps more clear and more sufficient!

He hadn’t come into contact with many supers, but for someone like Wang Ming, he actually didn’t have much faith in him.

Three days!

Liu Long felt that he could break through within three days. If he couldn ‘t, he didn’t have much hope. At that time, it would be best to let the night patrol handle it.

Li Hao nodded and agreed! Boss, there’s no time to lose … How about we go and see my teacher now?”

“No rush!”

Liu Long laughed,”it’s too eye-catching!” You’ve already been there a few times today. It’s not appropriate for you to go again. ”

“Besides, I also need to prepare. How about tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow, I’ll visit Yuan Shuo openly, give him an invitation, and invite him to attend the founding ceremony in three days!”

Liu Long laughed.”Three days later, we’ll invite everyone to attend the ceremony. It’ll be a good time to divert everyone’s attention and lower Qiao Feilong’s guard. He’s not a super, so he’s not on our invitation list. That day will be the best time to kill him!”

He had even set the time!

Liu Long continued,”the inaugural ceremony will be held at night!” Night patrollers are only suitable for business at night, so they can eliminate all unexpected factors in the city!”

It was also a good time to kill at night.

Li Hao nodded.

At this moment, he didn’t say anything more and turned to leave. Suddenly, he turned back and said,””Boss, aren’t you worried that I’m only lying to you and that the other party might be even stronger? or that after we kill Qiao Feilong, teacher might make a move on you?”

Liu Long, aren’t you worried about this?

Wasn’t he afraid that his side would kill him to silence him?

Liu Long sneered,”I’m afraid of this?” If I was afraid of this and that, I would have died long ago! I, Liu Long, was able to make a name for myself in the Silver City because I trust people!”

If he didn’t believe it, he would believe someone. He wouldn’t doubt it.

It was also because of this that he did not kill anyone when there was an internal incident in the law enforcement team. It was mu Sen who helped him clean up the mess.

Liu Long’s strengths were obvious, but his weaknesses were also huge.

At this moment, Li Hao realized that Liu Long was different from his teacher.

His teacher was a more cautious person. To put it bluntly, his teacher was more treacherous and cold-blooded.

Yes, cold-blooded.

Li Hao was actually very clear about this!

His teacher was good to him, but that didn’t mean that he was good to others. He was good to him because three years ago, his teacher was disheartened and treated him as a direct disciple, inheriting all of his knowledge. In the past, direct disciples were no different from biological sons, or perhaps even more important.

Thus, Li Hao never doubted his teacher, and Yuan Shuo treated him like his own son.

This was the meaning of being a direct disciple, and also the meaning of being a closed door disciple.

Liu Long, on the other hand, was a person who valued friendship more.

However, on the surface, Yuan Shuo was more amiable and Liu Long was more stern. Therefore, nine out of ten people would think that Liu Long was more difficult to get along with and unkind.

Li Hao suddenly laughed.

Sometimes, it was very interesting to see through some things.

Liu Yan wasn’t as passionate as he had imagined, Liu Long wasn’t as cold as he had imagined, his teacher wasn’t as kind as he looked, and he himself wasn’t as simple and honest as he looked.

People!

“Boss … Then I wish us success!”

Li Hao turned around and left with a smile.

Perhaps, everyone was different.

But at least there was one thing in common, they were both so decisive, without the slightest bit of sloppiness.

If I say I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!

Liu Long didn’t even bother to do any investigations, as it was meaningless. As long as he could confirm that there were experts, that would be the best proof. He would kill them first.

This was what they had in common.

At this moment, Li Hao, who had just walked out of the office, was also thinking about something. What should I do in this attack?

He was not strong enough to deal with the three suns or the sunlight.

On the contrary, it was easy to cause trouble!

He was still able to snipe at others, but he was not qualified to kill these people.

But Li Hao also hoped, or desired, to do something.

“What can I do?”

Li Hao thought for a moment and then realized something.

He gently pinched the Jade sword in his bosom. This was his greatest support from now on.

If his teacher or Liu Long were injured, he could heal them in time.

If he encountered a critical moment, now that he had broken through 100 points, would the Jade sword burst out with even more powerful power after stabbing his heart?

Unsealing and releasing even more powerful power?

All of this was unknown.

Maybe he could try!

He would try it out in advance. Unsealing the Jade sword might bring him greater help and increase his strength. At a critical moment, he could suddenly stab someone with his sword. It might have a miraculous effect.

At this thought, Li Hao smiled innocently again.

On the way, he met Li Meng and the others, and he greeted them with a smile.

It was a very innocent smile!

Li Meng and Hu Hao were embarrassed to not greet him. When they thought of how this person was their little senior brother and was smiling so sincerely, they also smiled.

They had thought that Li Hao wasn’t qualified to be their Deputy Minister.

However, with this sincere smile, the two of them felt a little relieved. Perhaps this was better. It was better than Liu Yan being the Deputy Minister. At least Li Hao was family.

……

At this moment, the Silver City was still as quiet as ever.

No one had expected that Li Hao’s group of three would be so determined and decisive in their decision to attack.

And Qiao Feilong would never have thought that Li Hao, who had been smiling and receiving benefits in the afternoon, would be running around the entire day discussing how to kill him.

……

Further away.

White moon City.

Hao lianchuan was also meeting some people in secret. He gave a serious warning,””Before we explore the ruins, no one is allowed to cause trouble in Silver City! “I think everyone here understands how important these ruins are. The reason why the night patrolman is willing to share them with you is also because he hopes that everyone can resolve this problem peacefully … However, if anyone dares to cause trouble in Silver City or Silver Moon province at this moment, then don’t blame the night patrolman for being impolite!”

The experts in the surroundings expressed their opinions.

This included Hong Yue, who had caused trouble some time ago. At this moment, someone also came with a cold and proud expression. He said coldly,””Don’t worry! We’ll talk about everything after the exploration is over!”

The red moon would not act rashly at this moment, in case she missed the exploration of the ruins.

As for the night watchmen … No one thought that they would take the initiative to stir up trouble. Silver City didn’t have that kind of strength, and the night watchmen here also lacked strength. On the other hand, the night watchmen were orderly.

Most of the time, the pedantic night patrollers were passive.

Hao lianchuan frowned slightly and said,”that’s great!” Whether it’s the war in the central region or the successful negotiations, it won’t affect our cooperation this time. Silver Moon province isn’t the strongest among the other provinces and doesn’t have any advantage … We still hope that this cooperation can strengthen the entire Silver Moon!”

“Of course!”

Someone chimed in. An expert who laughed like the King of Hell laughed coldly and said,””Don’t worry, Hao bu. We won’t look for trouble for no reason. Besides, it was Hong Yue who did that to the Silver City. It has nothing to do with us Yama. So, Hao bu doesn’t need to worry about Yama’s attitude!”

“Hehe!”

The red moon’s people also sneered.

Hao lianchuan was too lazy to say anything else.”I don’t care what you do. This is a warning. The night patrolmen might not be able to destroy you, but if they really do it, then none of you will have an easy time!”

With that, Hao lianchuan disappeared.

He felt a little more at ease. After the warning, there shouldn’t be any problems in the Silver City for the time being. Everyone was still hoping that Yuan Shuo could help them explore the ruins.

Therefore, Li Hao should be safe for now.

“I’ve tried my best … After the exploration of the ruins is over, it’s best to bring Li Hao to Whitemoon city. His safety should be guaranteed if he returns here. ”

Hao lianchuan thought to himself as he smiled.

As for Li Hao’s group looking for trouble … He had never considered it, nor had it ever appeared in his mind.



Chapter 244: Chapter 56: force comprehension (1)
Translator: 549690339
Silver City.

The world was peaceful.

The rainy season had passed, and the rain that had been pouring for several days had stopped.

The weather returned to its sweltering heat.

Heavenly joy House.

This was the place where Li Hao was living now. The neighborhood was not big, and there were only so many people in the wealthy District. Of course, the greenery was really good.

The air was fresher in the morning.

Early in the morning, Li Hao practiced martial arts in his own courtyard. It was very comfortable. The place was big, and it was different.

The nearest one was a few hundred meters away. It wasn’t too loud, and no one heard it.

Five birds technique!

The current Li Hao practiced the five birds technique externally and the nine-refined force internally.

The five birds technique was a move, while the nine-refined force was an internal technique and the superposition of the internal force.

The breathing technique of five birds was the foundation, the foundation of the birth of inner strength.

At this moment, Li Hao was trying to change his breathing technique.

In this aspect, a Martial Master seemed to be inferior to a super.

As the development of superpowers came later, there was only one way to absorb energy-the energy absorption technique. Of course, there were different forms of this technique, but there was no need to change the breathing technique.

One type was enough for them.

As for inner strength, it was a technique.

It was more complicated!

At this moment, Li Hao was trying to switch between the five birds breathing technique and the nine refined breathing technique, in case he could only use one of the two at a critical moment. If he used the nine refined force internally and couldn’t use the five birds technique externally, it would be a loss to Li Hao’s combat power.

“Isn’t there a fundamental technique?”

Li Hao thought as he practiced.

His fists were like ocean waves, layer by layer.

Stepping on the ground, he wanted to soar into the air, but he staggered slightly. The flying bird technique was actually a little blocked at this moment. This was a problem caused by different breathing techniques.

Li Hao quickly used the five birds breathing technique. The next moment, the black Tiger dug out the heart.

The layered inner strength slowly dissipated.

The ninth refinement breathing technique disappeared, and the ninth refinement force could not be gathered.

Li Hao wasn’t discouraged. This kind of thing was inevitable. He had asked his teacher, and his teacher had said that it would be difficult to simultaneously fuse them, but he could try.

For example, the breathing technique of five birds!

There should have been five different breathing techniques for five different types of beasts, but in the end, Yuan Shuo managed to come up with the five birds breathing technique. One breathing technique contained five different forms.

If Li Hao had the intention to integrate the sixth Shi into the five birds technique, the nine refinements might not have been a good match for the five birds technique, but techniques were created by humans.

If Li Hao could integrate the sixth force and then integrate the breathing technique of five birds, he would be able to use both techniques. At that time, Li Hao would also become a Grandmaster of his generation, a Grandmaster of the path of martial masters.

Yuan Shuo had done it before!

Of course, this required a large amount of knowledge accumulation, and it was not something that could be imagined.

Yuan Shuo’s brain was filled with too many things, so he was able to complete the breathing technique of five birds. He also borrowed some ancient books and records to create the breathing technique of five birds that he was proud of today. It was also regarded as a top secret by Yuan Shuo.

“Although I’ve studied many ancient books and listened to teacher’s teachings, I’ve only swallowed them without digesting them and turning them into my own knowledge. So, it’s impossible for me to merge the sixth force and form the six birds technique!”

Li Hao knew that he couldn’t do it.

Perhaps his teacher could.

However, since Liu Long was unwilling to teach his teacher the ninth-form technique, Li Hao couldn’t overstep his boundaries and rashly teach him. This was a taboo for martial masters.

He did a round of boxing, mainly to digest some of the red shadow power in his body.

Li Hao felt that the inner strength in his four limbs would be released very soon.

He was improving quickly, but he still felt that it was slow.

Right now, it was the period of his growth. The red shadow energy, sword energy, and mysterious energy were all accumulating in his body. He was just digesting them. If he missed this period, without the sword energy and red shadow energy, his future growth would probably slow down.

For Li Hao, the Silver City was a dangerous place, and he didn’t feel at ease when he had just broken through the 100-point threshold.

Pa pa!

After one last round of boxing, Li Hao gave up the nine forts and focused on using the five birds technique. Once again, he was as agile as an ape and quickly shuttled through the small courtyard.

His gaze also turned to the door.

A few hundred meters in front of his courtyard was Qiao Peng’s residence.

Qiao Feilong didn’t seem to be staying here.

At this moment, a ball of light appeared in Qiao Peng’s residence. It could be seen from a few hundred meters away. Li Hao took a look and saw that it was as dazzling as a full moon. He knew in his heart that this was the superhuman at the Yue Ying level!

In the Qiao’s mining headquarters, other than Qiao Feilong, there was also a Dark Moon existence.

It seemed that the guy was here.

He wondered if they were monitoring him.

Li Hao didn’t care. Even if he used the sound of bones, he only had the strength of the tenth severing realm. It didn’t affect the overall situation, and no one would care too much about it. It would be a problem if he didn’t enter the tenth severing realm. It meant that he was too trash and didn’t meet Yuan Shuo’s standards for a disciple.

It was almost time for work.

Li Hao tidied up, took a shower, changed his clothes, and walked out of the courtyard.

……

Outside the small courtyard.

Qiao Peng’s car was already parked at the entrance. Today, Qiao Peng wasn’t the one driving, but that full moon elite. He was very low-key, as if he was invisible.

The car window was rolled down.

“Patrol li!”

Qiao Peng was very enthusiastic, and he said with a smile,””I was a little slow yesterday, and my father also reprimanded me. I thought about Liu Yan the whole night … There are plenty of fish in the sea, and I, Qiao Peng, don’t need to offend patrol li for a woman!”

“Patrol li, if you’re willing to give me face, I’ll be the host tonight. We’ll set up a table in a restaurant in the Silver City. It’s better to make enemies less enemies. I’ll apologize to Captain Liu and patrol li. How about it?”


Chapter 245: Chapter 56: force comprehension (2)
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao glanced at him, waved his hand, and said impatiently,””Forget it, I’m not interested in getting to know young master Qiao. Besides … If I want to make friends, it should be with old master Qiao!”

Then, he rode his bike and left.

His words were very straightforward. You don’t deserve it.

I’m willing to make friends with your father.

Qiao Peng furrowed his brows slightly but quickly regained his composure. He watched Li Hao leave and said after a while,””Uncle Chen, he has already cut ten states, right?”

“Yes.”

The driver replied and glanced at Li Hao. A moment later, he said,””He might have been in the tenth realm for a few days. When I felt him punching in the morning, his fist technique was still a little stagnant and often interrupted, which means that he is not very familiar with it. It seems that Yuan Shuo did not teach him the real martial Dao before.”

In the morning, Li Hao practiced boxing and changed his breathing technique several times. He often paused. As an expert at the yingyue level, the driver actually felt it.

This was obviously a problem for newcomers!

Of course, it wasn’t unexpected for Li Hao to appear, because he was a newcomer to the Martial Master path. Anyone who knew Li Hao would know that he had only come into contact with superficial knowledge before.

Qiao Peng laughed, unsurprised.

He said softly,”he became the Deputy Minister because of Yuan Shuo’s power … The night patrolman is also disdainful. He has just entered the ten-slash realm. He was a guy who relied on his mysterious power to get there. How can he lead a few moon nether … I wonder what those people think?”

The driver did not say anything.

“But this guy, even though he’s arrogant after gaining power, he’s still self-encouraging. He gets off work on time and goes to work on time … What a weirdo!” Qiao Peng continued.

He was already the deputy head of the night patrol, but Li Hao still went to work on time and even rode his own bicycle …

One had to admit that he was a very strange person!

Of course, it could be that he had gained power rashly and had not learned the way of life of people at this level.

Qiao Peng looked at Li Hao’s disappearing figure again. He raised his hand and the car started, driving toward the Qiao’s mining company.

He had only come into contact with Li Hao to make it easier for him to observe him.

There were countless people watching Li Hao, so there was no need to get too close. Qiao Peng was happy that Li Hao was not willing to eat with him. It would save him a lot of trouble. That guy had ridiculed him time and time again. He was still a shrewd person, but he couldn’t help but feel sullen.

……

At the law enforcement building.

Li Hao arrived on time.

He didn’t go to his office but went straight to Liu Yan’s office.

He didn’t see Liu Yan last night, but this person actually left work early. He had to admit that it was a rare sight.

“Yo, did the sun rise from the West?”

Liu Yan couldn’t help but smile when she saw Li Hao.

This guy actually took the initiative to come to his office.

How rare!

Li Hao had been here a few times, but he had never taken the initiative to come. What was going on today?

Li Hao grinned.”Look at me. I haven’t seen you for a night. You’ve become prettier again!”

“Bah!”

Liu Yan spat, but Li Hao was completely confused. I was just complimenting you. I was just being polite, why are you angry?

Liu Yan saw that he was confused and couldn’t help but scold him, “Don’t talk nonsense. What do you mean you’ve become better looking after not seeing you for a night? this is not a compliment, it’s more like a curse! I’m a widow, and I’m getting thinner and more Haggard by the day. I’ve become so beautiful after not seeing you for a day … Do you think there’s a problem with this?”

Li Hao was a little confused. Was there a problem?

Forget it, if you say there is, then there is.

Liu Yan smiled and didn’t argue with him anymore.”Why did you come to my place?”

“It’s a gift!”

Li Hao lifted the box in his hand.”Yesterday, when I went to the Qiao’s mining company, Qiao Feilong gave me 10 cubic meters of mysterious energy. He said that it was for my sister as an apology.”

Liu Yan’s face turned cold!

She glanced at Li Hao, who was still smiling.”Sister, it would be a waste not to have it! If you don’t want it, I’ll take it. ”

Liu Yan frowned slightly. After a moment, she said,”You can keep it!”

She was a little unhappy, but she didn’t say it.

There were some things that could be accepted.

There were some things that he could not accept!

Mr. Qiao gave him 10 cubic meters of mysterious energy, what was that?

That was money to buy his life!

Li Hao had actually accepted this. He clearly knew this, and she had even told him about it. At this moment, Liu Yan was a little angry, but she suppressed it. 10 cubic meters of mysterious energy … If Li Hao wanted to accept it, then so be it.

Li Hao sneakily approached Liu Yan and whispered,””If I don’t accept it now, I’m afraid I won’t have the chance in the future!”

Liu Yan raised her brows. What did he mean?

“Sis, we’re the night watchers, an official superpower organization, a legitimate organization with power, how can we be taken advantage of? How can I not take revenge?”

With Liu Long, they were talking about the details.

He didn’t need to say all this to Liu Yan. He only needed to say that he would take revenge for her.

“Don’t be rash!”Liu Yan’s expression changed.

“We’ve alerted the Yama and offended the red moon …”

Before she could finish, Li Hao laughed and said,””Sister, your news is too outdated! So what if he’s a Yama? You probably don’t know this, but in the central region, a few god tier Masters who were on night patrol even killed the Yama’s grandson! We’ve also seized their precious treasures, and they’ve long since been beaten to a pulp. The wars in the central region even originated from this!”

Liu Yan and the others didn’t know about these things, and they were very limited in their information.

This was something that couldn’t be helped. Silver Moon province belonged to the border, and silver City was the border of the border. Liu Yan and the others had just been promoted from the inspection Division, so they didn’t even know the situation of the night patrols in white moon City, let alone the central region.

They only knew that there was chaos outside, but they didn’t know the exact situation.
