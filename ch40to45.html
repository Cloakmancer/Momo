       Chapter 40: Demon-hunting Team (2)
       Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
       At the Inspection Office.
       
       Confidential Information Room.
       
       Li Hao was the first to arrive. He did a simple sweep of the office and boiled a pot of hot water as usual.
       
       Chen Na was a newbie like him so she arrived early as well. Just a few minutes after him.
       
       The weather was hot and Chen Na looked sleepy early in the morning. She probably hadn’t slept well last night. She kept yawning. “Li Hao!” she said when she saw him. “You are so mean. Why didn’t you tell me you were investigating last night?”
       
       “You heard about it?”
       
       “Of course, I do!” she said. “The law enforcement team was dispatched last night.”
       
       The law enforcement team being dispatched wasn’t a small matter, so naturally the news might have spread far and wide.
       
       Chen Na shook her head to brush off the drowsiness. “Did you meet the murder last night?” she asked curiously.
       
       “No,” he said. “But I felt like I was being followed.”
       
       “Really?” she asked eagerly. Chen Na had never been involved in a major case before, so she was excited to know more. “So, the files you showed me… the people were all murdered?”
       
       “Probably.” Li Hao nodded.
       
       “Then you have already made an important contribution to the case!” said Chen Na. “Li Hao, if you find the murderer, you will be a hero! You might even be promoted to a Level 2 rank!”
       
       She was a little envious that Li Hao could be a part of such an investigation while she couldn’t.?But she was glad for him, nonetheless.
       
       “We don’t have any more clues yet,” said Li Hao.
       
       Chen Na rolled her eyes. “That’s where I come in. We agreed to go to my hometown tomorrow, right? Maybe we will find clues there! Li Hao, if I help you and get involved in the case and if we somehow find the murderer, do you think I will be recognized too? Do you think we will be followed?!”
       
       Li Hao had almost forgotten that they had planned a trip to Chen Na’s hometown. But he had been targeted so easily yesterday. It had been dangerous.
       
       Li Hao hesitated. “Forget about it. We are not going. It’s too dangerous. It’s better to keep a low profile right now.”
       
       He didn’t want to put Chen Na in danger. The field of superhumans and superpowers was hazardous.
       
       As for the Silver City Song, he wasn’t in a hurry to find out more. Now that he had more information about the red shadow, he felt that he could find a way to defeat it. He could always investigate the song later anyway.
       
       “What? We aren’t going?” Chen Na was disappointed. “Li Hao, let’s go together! What’s there to be afraid of? We can just tell the law enforcement team that we will be their bait, if they ask. We might even lead them directly to the murderer and they will be caught!” She knew the risk but she still wanted to be part of this.
       
       “We’ll see how it goes,” said Li Hao.
       
       They talked for a while till others arrived. Many people seemed to know about last night’s incident.
       
       Sister Yu made a beeline towards Li Hao the moment she reached the office. “Little Hao! How could you be so stupid!”?she scolded. “Don’t involve yourself in such a dangerous case! Just stay in the Confidential Information Room. It will be safer for you. Don’t get involved with the law enforcement team.”
       
       “That’s right, little Hao,” said Brother Zhou. “Listen to Sister Yu. Don’t get involved in something like this. It’s very dangerous and there is no benefit.”
       
       Everyone either scolded him or urged him to be safe. They all cared for him so they tried to persuade him in their own way.
       
       Staying in the Confidential Information Room had been safe and comfortable. Most of them had not been at the front lines for quite a while now. They were worried they would be dragged to the front lines to fight.
       
       Li Hao didn’t try to argue. He just nodded and remained polite. He made it appear as though he had no choice in this matter.
       
       ...
       
       The crowd around him only dispersed when Wang Jie arrived.
       
       “Li Hao, come to my office,” he said and headed to his cabin.
       
       Li Hao got up and followed.
       
       ...
       
       When they were both in the office, Wang Jie looked at Li Hao carefully. He then smiled and pressed his hand together. “Sit,” he said.
       
       Li Hao sat down.
       
       “You don’t have to be so quiet and reserved,” he said. “It will not be easy to be in the law enforcement team.”
       
       Li Hao raised his head and looked at his Chief.
       
       “They called me last night,” said Wang Jie. “They said they wanted you transferred to their team. Liu Long rarely ever takes an interest in anyone. It is very rare for him to personally ask for anyone. It seems he places great importance on you. You have really caught his eye because of the self-immolation cases. The law enforcement team wants you. What do you think?”
       
       Wang Jie couldn’t refuse Liu Long. Of course, if Li Hao refused, Yuan Shuo was there like a pillar for him. But Liu Long was much more powerful in title and status than Wang Jie. But Wang Jie wanted to hear Li Hao’s opinion on this first.
       
       Li Hao lowered his head and thought for a moment. “Chief, I would like to join them. I have learnt a great deal being in the Confidential Information Room. I like working here but… as you already know, I want to avenge my friend by finding the culprit.”
       
       Wang Jie sighed. He did care for this kid. “Actually, personally I don’t want you to leave. I am even prepared to write a letter to the higher-ups and see if I can give you a promotion. But… I understand. I understand how much the self-immolation cases mean to you. So, I won’t stop you.”
       
       Wang Jie looked at Li Hao with worry. “But you must be careful. The law enforcement team deals with dangerous cases. Especially for this self-immolation case, I suggest you stay away and maintain the paperwork and such. Don’t be eager to rush to the front lines no matter how simple a mission might sound. If this case can’t be solved by the law enforcement team, it’s likely to attract the attention of… other higher-ups.”

Li Hao silently nodded.

Seeing this, Wang Jie didn’t say anything. He actually quite liked Li Hao.

However, this was his goal in coming to the inspection Office, so he couldn’t persuade him any further.

“The self-immolation case is over. If you still want to come back, you can write a report. You’re always welcome to come back!”

“Thank you, chief!”

Li Hao thanked him, and Wang Jie said with a smile,””You’re welcome. Go and report to the law enforcement team first and see when they will officially transfer people. When the transfer order is given, organize a farewell party in the confidential room.”

“Thank you, chief!”

Li Hao thanked them again. Everyone had been nice to him in the critical room.

In fact, if it wasn’t for the situation, he would have thought that staying in the importance room was a good choice.

……

When Li Hao left the office, he didn’t tell anyone that he was going to be transferred.

Li Hao didn’t pack anything. After saying goodbye to Chen Na, he went out for a while and quickly headed to the law enforcement team.

The law enforcement team and the confidential room were both at the inspection Office headquarters.

However, they were not in the same building.

The computer room was in the office behind the patrol Hall, while the law enforcement team was in the building next to it. The entire building was the territory of the law enforcement team, which was much more luxurious than the computer room.

Li Hao, who was wearing an inspector’s uniform, walked to the entrance of the law enforcement building. No one stopped him.

At the entrance of the building, the members of the law enforcement team were coming and going, each and every one of them looking very tough.

Compared to them, Li Hao seemed to be a little thin and unremarkable.

Li Hao didn’t ask anyone and went upstairs.

He went to look for Liu Yan.

Liu Yan was the vice-captain of the law enforcement team and had her own office on the sixth floor.

Soon, Li Hao reached the sixth floor.

There weren’t many people on the sixth floor, only some leaders ‘offices.

After looking around and finding the name plate, Li Hao knocked on the door of an office.

“Come in!”

Liu Yan’s voice didn’t sound as flirtatious as last night ‘s. Instead, it was a little cold.

When Li Hao pushed the door open and entered, Liu Yan’s tone changed. She said with a smile,”Oh, little Li Hao, you’re here. It seems that you didn’t sleep well last night and missed your sister so early in the morning?”

“Good Morning Captain Liu!”

Li Hao saluted and remained unmoved. He was very well-behaved.

She was flirtatious but not attractive to him.

Moreover, danger was lurking everywhere. He wasn’t interested in admiring this person’s charm. Not to mention, this Captain Liu wasn’t simple and was in cahoots with Liu Long. Li Hao didn’t want to find trouble for himself.

“Little Li Hao, why are you being so serious?”

Liu Yan smiled like a flower, while Li Hao stood straight and glanced at her office.

He was secretly shocked.

The office was huge. It didn’t feel like it was smaller than the computer room’s office area. It was at least 100 to 200 square meters.

That wasn’t the main point. It was normal for the law enforcement team to be generous, but what was abnormal was that Li Hao saw some weapons of mass destruction placed in the office.

.

What was the third generation of the vortex?

Such a small pistol was trash!

Storm 1!

Li Hao had heard of this before. It was an extremely destructive assault gun that could fire 300 rounds at a time.

The Eagle Eye IV was the most advanced sniper gun with an accurate range of more than 500 meters, and its actual killing range was even larger.

Armor-breaking second generation, it was said that it could directly penetrate steel.

……

This wasn’t an office, this was an Armory!

Li Hao was shocked.

Liu Yan seemed to have noticed the change in his expression and immediately laughed.”Little Li Hao, don’t be surprised. These are just models. I’m just playing with them. They’re not real!”

Li Hao was speechless. Do you think I’ll believe you?

Model?

The metallic texture emitted a cold metallic light. Was this a model?

Do you think I’m blind?

The law-enforcement team was really something. Liu Yan actually placed these weapons of mass destruction in her office in such a grand manner.

“It really is a model!”

Liu Yan laughed. Suddenly, she picked up a black grenade and threw it at Li Hao.”I’m just playing. It’ll be fine!”

Li Hao’s expression changed, and he hurriedly took it.

Cold sweat could be seen on his forehead!

F * ck!

It won’t explode, right?

“Don’t be afraid!”

Liu Yan approached him and chuckled. Seeing Li Hao reach out to take the grenade and pull the pin, she chuckled and said,””I’m fine. The bolt wasn’t pulled. What happened?”

Li Hao’s scalp went numb!

Are you crazy?

She actually pulled the bolt!

At this moment, Li Hao wanted to escape.

Fortunately, Liu Yan quickly smiled and took the grenade, throwing it out of the window.

“I’m really fine, it’s fake!”

BOOM!

A loud sound was heard, and the room shook.

Li Hao’s face turned pale. Fake?

‘Also, is this woman crazy? you threw her down and she even exploded. This ... This is still fine?’

Liu Yan, however, had been staring at him. Seeing Li Hao’s face turn pale, she suddenly stopped smiling and said calmly,””Little Li Hao, you can’t do that!”

“What?”

“You’re already scared?”

Liu Yan returned to her seat and leaned back in her chair. She placed her feet on the office table and said lazily,””This thing can’t compare to supers! Some people could casually cast a small fireball and its power might be greater than this! If you are not careful ... You will die! If you’re afraid of a grenade’s explosion, you’re too timid. How can you join us?”

Li Hao furrowed his brows slightly, but they quickly relaxed.””I don’t understand any of this! I’m just an ordinary person. Even if I really join the law enforcement team, I might not have to deal with these people. Captain Liu, I should be afraid. I’ll be more used to it after a few more times. ”




Chapter 42: Demon-hunting team (4)
Translator: 549690339
“Is that so?”

Liu Yan laughed,”you’re so timid, but that’s different from what boss said. He said you’re very bold!” In fact, I also think that you’re quite courageous. If you’re really a coward, you know that the self-immolation case isn’t simple, but you still dare to continue investigating it?”

“There are some things that I have to do!”

Li Hao also regained his calm,’you know that there are Tigers in the mountain, but you’re still going to the Tiger Mountain! Just like you, Captain Liu, you know that supers are not easy to deal with, but you still provoke them. Are you not afraid? I think that everyone is afraid, but ... Sometimes, we have to do it!”

“That makes sense!”

Liu Yan nodded in agreement and laughed again. “That’s right, everyone is afraid, I’m afraid too, boss is actually afraid too! Just because we’re scary doesn’t mean we’ll give up!”

She looked at Li Hao.”I don’t think you’ll be of any help to us, but ... Since boss said so, then I welcome you to the law enforcement team. This isn’t important. What’s important is that I welcome you to the demon hunting squad!”

Demon hunting!

Li Hao’s eyes flickered. Was this the name of their team?

Seeing Liu Yan’s outstretched hand, Li Hao reached out to shake it.

As soon as they made contact, Li Hao’s heart skipped a beat. The next moment, Liu Yan exerted force on her wrist and grabbed Li Hao’s right hand. With a twist of her hand, before Li Hao could react, Liu Yan threw him over her shoulder. With a bang, Li Hao fell heavily to the ground!

The moment he fell to the ground, Li Hao quickly jumped up.

He had practiced the ape art for three years, and it was somewhat effective. Li Hao endured the pain and jumped out of Liu Yan’s attack range.

Liu Yan didn’t attack again and just watched quietly.

With a hint of admiration, he teased,””Not bad! Although his vigilance was a little weak and his skills were average, his reaction speed was still okay. This was the ape technique from the new book of five birds, right? You’ve trained quite well!”

Li Hao was silent and alert.

He was also shocked. This woman looked weak, but when she grabbed his arm, he felt that her hand was as hard as steel. Li Hao didn’t need to look to know that his arm was swollen!

He had great strength!

He felt like he was being held by steel!

“I’m just testing your skills, don’t be afraid!”

Liu Yan smiled flirtatiously and returned to her previous appearance.

Li Hao, on the other hand, didn’t dare to be careless!

“It’s a good thing that you have the foundation of the five birds technique. The ape technique is not good at attacking, but it’s good at escaping. If you can practice it to your teacher’s level, even ordinary supers might not be able to catch up to you!”

Hearing this, Li Hao’s eyes flickered. He thought for a moment, then said in a low voice,””Captain Liu, you mean ... My teacher’s ape art is very strong?”

“What?”

Liu Yan was stunned for a moment. In the next moment, she laughed so hard that her body swayed back and forth.

“Who wrote the new book of five birds? It was made up by old Yuan! You suspect that the creator of the ‘new book of five birds’ isn’t strong in the five birds technique?”

Liu Yan laughed for a while before suddenly stopping. Your teacher, Yuan Shuo, may not be a superhuman, but back when superpowers were not around, he was a top-tier master in the mortal realm! However, when superpowers appear, if you don’t enter the realm of superpowers ... Sigh!”

He sighed, not knowing if it was for Yuan Shuo or for himself.

So what if the mortal’s martial arts were profound?

No matter how good one’s skills were, they might not be able to block a fireball, a flash of blade light, or a flash of lightning from a super.

This was a tragedy!

However, Liu Yan quickly sobered up. She retracted her smile and walked out. “Let’s go and find the boss. We can also let you understand what we’re doing and what you should do. You should have some understanding of the enemy and yourself. We don’t expect you to do anything, just don’t drag us down!”

Li Hao’s heart started beating.

Super power!

Perhaps, he could learn more about superpowers from Liu Long. This would be his first step towards becoming a superpower.

These people dared to attack supers, so they must have a good understanding of supers.

This was another important reason why Li Hao wanted to join the law enforcement team. Only by understanding his opponent could he better deal with the red shadow.





Chapter 43: I feel like I’m very strong
Translator: 549690339
Liu Yan didn’t bring Li Hao to Liu Long’s office.

Instead, he turned left and right and finally entered the basement of the law enforcement building, which was an underground area that no one else could enter.

The place was very big. As soon as Li Hao entered, he felt that it was a little empty, but it was very quiet.

It was so quiet that it was a little scary.

If it could make one’s hair stand on end in the law enforcement building, this place was obviously not ordinary.

At the entrance area, there was a large number of training equipment.

Just like Liu Yan’s office, a large number of weapons were hanging on the wall.

There were both hot and cold weapons.

Blades, Spears, swords, halberds, everything was present.

As for hot weapons, Li Hao even saw a small cannon. Li Hao’s scalp went numb. My God, how many weapons did these guys have?

The law enforcement team had an advantage.

Even if Liu Long’s place was found, it would not matter. He was the captain of the law enforcement team, the boss of the blizzard Silver city’s violent organization. If he said that these weapons were used to deal with criminals, no one would be able to find any fault with it.

If Li Hao dared to hoard so many weapons, he would have been captured and shot to death long ago.

In front of the fitness area and the weapons warehouse, there was a small passage that seemed to lead to other areas.

Liu Yan didn’t bring Li Hao in.

Upon entering the fitness area, Liu Yan shouted,””Boss, they’re here!”

A moment later, a few figures walked out from the depths.

Liu Long was tall and strong, Wu Chao was as thin as a bamboo pole, a man so fat that he trembled when he walked, and a petite woman who looked kind and was not very old.

Including Liu Yan, there were exactly five people.

This was the demon hunting squad of the law enforcement team.

Even though it was very hot in this season, Liu Long still wore a windbreaker, mostly to cover the weapons hanging all over his body. Otherwise, anyone would be able to tell that there was something wrong with him bringing so many weapons out.

“Liu Long!”

Liu Long strode over, his face still as cold as before. He introduced himself once more,”Captain of the demon hunting squad, you’re in charge of a frontal assault!”

Wu Chao, who was thin and weak, also laughed faintly,””Wu Chao, Scout of the demon-hunting team. You’re in charge of intelligence gathering and attracting fire from the side!”

The astonishingly fat man introduced himself with a simple and heavy voice,””Chen Jian, the shield Guard of the demon hunting squad, in charge of defense!”

The petite woman’s voice was also very gentle.”Yunyao, the doctor of the demon hunting team. She will be in charge of the treatment.”

Four people with different positions and different functions.

The division of labor was very clear!

Although there were few people, they had all the vital organs.

Li Hao glanced at Liu Yan. What was she in charge of?

Liu Yan smiled sweetly. When she saw Li Hao looking at her, she said,””What are you looking at? Liu Yan, the vice-captain and vice-attacker of the demon hunting squad! Boss is the main attacker, I’ll be responsible for the last hit!”

Li Hao understood.

Liu Long looked at Li Hao and calmly said,”we are all members of the demon hunting squad!” There were more people in the past, but now ... There’s a lot less. It’s just the few of us!”

“Now, the team only has two main and Deputy attackers, one doctor, one shield defender, and one Scout each.”

“Li Hao, are you willing to join us?” he asked in a deep voice.

Li Hao nodded.

Liu Long looked at him deeply,”Li Hao, do you know why we are called the demon hunting squad?”

Li Hao didn’t say anything.

Liu Long answered his own question,”because ... We are justice!”

Justice?

At this moment, Li Hao was even a little dazed. He looked at the people in front of him. Are we ... Justice?

Liu Long’s voice was cold and unquestionable,”We are justice! Perhaps we have our own goals and thoughts, but don’t forget that we’re the law enforcement team of the inspection Office! We’re a law enforcement agency, we uphold justice, we protect the Silver City, everything we do, on one hand, it’s to protect ourselves, to strengthen ourselves, on the other hand, it’s to maintain peace!”

“The demons we’ve hunted are all those who disturb the mortal world and have blood on their hands!”

“Li Hao, the first thing you have to do after joining us is forget everything else. Remember, we are justice! And those supers who made mistakes are demons. It’s just that the Nightwatchers can’t clean them up, so we’re in charge of cleaning up the filth!”

The moment he joined the demon hunting squad, Liu Long began to instill the mission of the squad into Li Hao.

Or rather, this was the badge of a demon-hunting squad!

A small team with their own plans was extremely dangerous to them, because the enemies they were dealing with were beyond their imagination.

Therefore, this small team actually had their own beliefs or beliefs.

Justice!

Regardless of whether it was true or not, they believed that they were the messengers of justice and were driving away the demons for the Silver City.

“Justice ...”

Li Hao muttered.

“That’s right!”Liu Long’s voice was extremely serious. Justice! Li Hao, remember this! The demon hunting squad was The Guardian of the Silver City! Without us, the Silver City would have suffered countless casualties and become the backyard of many supers!”

“Of course, you may not believe it now! However, go out and take a look. This vast world, with hundreds and thousands of cities, is in chaos except for the central region. The chaotic world has come, and human lives are like ants!”

“The appearance of a transcendent could cause chaos in a city! My Silver City had been living in peace for the past few years. Although there were riots, it had been peaceful! The demon hunting squad has been established for five years and has killed five supers, one per year. Every time, they are saving the Silver City!”







Chapter 44: I think I’m very strong
Translator: 549690339
Liu Yan stood beside Li Hao with her arms crossed. She smiled and said,””Boss is right. Although boss likes to brag, his words are true! We joined the demon hunting squad for our own reasons. Maybe our original purpose wasn’t to protect anyone, but that’s the truth. Because of our existence, the Silver City can live and work in peace!”

Li Hao was deep in thought.

Perhaps, what Liu Long said wasn’t wrong.

They might have hunted down the supers to make themselves transcendent, but in fact, they might have also hunted down some supers who were preparing to wreak havoc in the Silver City.

Was it very chaotic outside?

Li Hao didn’t know.

He had almost never left Silver City. He had been to the neighboring city once, but that was many years ago.

“Li Hao, this is the first lesson I’ve taught you since you joined the team!”

Liu Long’s tone was menacing.”Don’t think that we’re ghosts who act in the dark. Wrong, we’re law-enforcement officers. We’re messengers who uphold and uphold justice! Therefore, to us, anyone who makes a mistake is a devil! Demon hunt, demon hunt, we hunt these demons!”

Li Hao suddenly felt relieved.

Even though Liu Long’s words were somewhat self-praising and had the meaning of a strategy.

However, when Liu Long said that they were the true justice and the true enforcers, Li Hao suddenly felt ... Very comfortable.

He just felt comfortable for some reason!

We’re not sinister people who act in the dark. We’re the Guardians of the entire city. Although this might not be our original intention, the truth is here.

An expert!

At this moment, Li Hao felt even more strongly that Liu Long was an expert.

Not only was his strength and mind top-notch, but the other party was also very good at guiding his thoughts.

He made every member of the demon hunting squad believe that everything they did was for justice.

No sense of guilt!

Killing supers would only make one feel accomplished. It was to protect the people, to protect justice, and to protect the Silver City.

This kind of psychological satisfaction was not something an ordinary leader could achieve.

As for Liu Long, he actually had some achievements in this area.

At this moment, Li Hao felt that joining a demon hunting squad might be a good choice.

At this moment, Liu Long said in a deep voice,””Li Hao, introduce yourself!”

Li Hao thought for a moment, then said,”I’m Li Hao, the chief patrol officer of the original intelligence office. I’m a expelled student from the Silver City ancient Academy!” I’m skilled in the ape technique of the five birds technique, and my movements are more agile. ”

“No more?”

Liu Long looked at him. Li Hao was a little embarrassed.”No,”

“Just like that, you’ve become Yuan Shuo’s last disciple?” Liu Long said coldly.

“That’s teacher’s favor,”Li Hao said, a little embarrassed.

“Li Hao, if you don’t have enough value here, we won’t give up on you when you’re in danger, but we won’t risk our lives to save you! If you have enough value, even if we have to sacrifice our lives, we will still let you live. Let our beliefs continue!”

Li Hao was silent for a while, then added,””I’m also good at deciphering ancient texts. In the exploration of ancient civilizations, deciphering ancient texts is an important part. My memory is very good, and this is one of my strengths. ”

The few of them looked at each other with strange expressions.

Ancient text analysis!

Would it work?

There was!

It was very useful!

Yuan Shuo’s current status was high because he was the head of the ancient civilization Exploration Department. His identity was not the key. The key was that Yuan Shuo was also an expert in ancient civilization and had a deep understanding of ancient civilization.

Therefore, even the night patrollers relied on him a lot.

However, the night watchmen did not dare to let Yuan Shuo become a super, because once Yuan Shuo became a super, a lot of trouble would happen.

There were some things that were useless to ordinary people, but they were very useful to supers.

However, supers often did not have enough knowledge and insight to identify things that were useful to them.

Yuan Shuo could do it!

An ordinary person like Yuan Shuo would not dare to keep it for himself.

However, once Yuan Shuo became a superhuman, he might not be able to control himself. Once he found some treasures, he might take them for himself without anyone knowing.

At this moment, Liu Long’s eyes slightly lit up!

“How much of Yuan Shuo’s true inheritance did you obtain?”

Li Hao said humbly,”Captain, you overestimate me. My teacher’s knowledge is as vast as the ocean. I’m just absorbing a drop of it.”

“Speak human language!”

“……”

Li Hao had no choice but to say,”I only followed my teacher for two years in the ancient academy. I mainly studied. I didn’t participate in any practical activities.” “Teacher is good at too many things. Right now, I’m only studying the analysis of ancient characters. Other abilities are far inferior to teacher ‘s. Teacher is good at too many things, such as trap cracking, antique preservation, Feng Shui positioning, ancient civilization and culture ...”

Speaking of Yuan Shuo, Li Hao was also full of emotion. He sighed and said,””After I left the ancient academy, I was busy with other things and didn’t have the time to study. Teacher’s abilities, I really can’t catch up to you!”

Liu Long said in a deep voice,”it’s already very good!” To be able to catch Yuan Shuo’s eye, it means that you have talent and ability!”

Ancient language analysis ...

He didn’t say more about this and quickly said,””Very well then. Li Hao, from today on, you are the intelligence analyst of the demon hunting squad and ... The bait!”

“……”

There was silence.

Bait can also be a part-time job?

On the side, Wu Chao smiled faintly. His smile was always so ghostly and a little cold.

“Little friend, it seems that I can be liberated! Before this, after the previous bait of the demon hunting squad died, I had always been the one to take over the position. I was really afraid that I would die one day, but now it seems ... Someone has taken over the position!”




Chapter 45: I think I’m very strong
Translator: 549690339
It turned out that he was the previous generation!

Li Hao was also speechless.

Of course, before he came, Liu Long had already made it clear that he was the bait.

However, it was now officially confirmed.

The next moment, Liu Long looked at Li Hao and said with a slight frown,””Of course, I asked you to be the bait, not to send you to your death! Your strength doesn’t seem to be much with that body of yours. Even if you’ve cultivated the ape Arts, you won’t have much of an impact in such a short time!”

Then, he walked towards the fitness equipment.””Come, let’s test your abilities! Let me have an idea of how I’m going to train you next. At the same time, I’ll see if you have the confidence to escape from the hands of supers. ”

Experiment?

Li Hao didn’t say anything and followed him.

The others were also very curious and followed him.

Liu Yan’s mouth was almost touching Li Hao’s ear. She softly laughed and said,””Show me all you’ve got, don’t hide! You’re too weak, so there’s no need to hide it. Hiding your strength will only make your harvest small. Boss still has some good things on hand!”

Li Hao didn’t say anything. He just avoided the other party’s mouth. Don’t blow into my ears. It’s uncomfortable.

“Giggle ...”

Liu Yan laughed happily. In front of them, Liu Long didn’t care about this.

The other female member, the doctor, Yun Yao, chuckled and said,””Sister Yan, stop teasing him.”

“Who’s teasing him?”

Liu Yan smiled like a flower.”Little Hao is so good-looking. Look at our team. They’re ugly!” He was as thin as a bamboo pole and as fat as a wall. The captain was still alright, but not only was he old, his skin was also dark, like a black coal ball! Little Hao is still the prettiest!”

The other three men’s footsteps slowed down.

No one said anything.

However, Li Hao felt that he was innocent. He seemed to have offended three people at once.

I didn’t say any of that. It was Liu Yan who said it, so don’t hold a grudge against me.

At this moment, everyone had already arrived at the fitness area.

All kinds of equipment!

Liu Long didn’t care about what had just happened, and his voice remained the same,”Before entering the transcendent realm, humans also have powerful cultivators. For example, your teacher Yuan Shuo has cultivated the five birds technique to the extreme, and his combat power is extremely strong!”

“For example, the previous patrol Secretary wore an iron cloth armor and cultivated it to the extreme. Ordinary swords can’t penetrate it, and firearms can only leave some external injuries.”

.

“These people are all in the mortal realm. They are the representatives of a divine technique that has been cultivated to the extreme!”

“Before the appearance of transcendents, we called these people martial masters! He’s a martial arts master and a Grandmaster. He’s the representative of a mortal body that can resist firearms!”

A Martial Master!

Li Hao listened carefully. These were all areas he had never been involved in before.

Liu Long continued,”there are also strong and weak martial masters. Of course, most of the time, it’s not just a matter of strength!” Some are skilled in speed, some are skilled in defense, some are skilled in strength ...”

“Everyone has their own strengths, so naturally, it’s not good to put them together and distinguish them! The faster one might be able to kill the stronger but slower Martial Master! The stronger one can also kill the faster Martial Master with one punch. ”

“As a Martial Master, you must have an outstanding ability that surpasses ordinary people. Only then can you be called a Martial Master! Speed and strength are the most intuitive manifestations. As for other aspects, such as defensive ability, such as Chen Jian ‘s, it is difficult to measure how good he is until it is a life and death moment. ”

Li Hao nodded again.

This was the logic!

He looked at Liu Long and asked curiously,””Captain, are you saying that it’s difficult to distinguish between the strong and the weak? “Therefore, all martial masters are similar ...”

“Nonsense!”

“……”

Li Hao was speechless. You said so.

Liu Long turned to look at him,”don’t think too much. The strong are strong, and the weak are weak!” Therefore, more than ten years ago, martial masters were also divided into strong and weak, but there were not many levels. They were ten-slash, hundred-breakthrough, and thousand-combat! This is a Martial Master!”

Li Hao was slightly stunned. This ... Was too intuitive!

It was too simple!

Liu Long seemed to know what he meant and coldly said,”You understand it immediately, right? He was just this direct! The people here referred to the standard of the soldiers in the regular army! The most basic requirement for anyone who could be called a Martial Master was to be able to break through a ten-man team and kill them. This was the standard of killing ten! If you can defeat an Army of a hundred with a single strike, you are an expert who has surpassed a hundred!”

“As for Qian warrior ...”

Liu Long took a deep breath.”That’s only in theory. In reality, no matter how strong you are, you’ll still die if you encounter an Army of a thousand people, even without firearms!” Your physical strength and mental strength will be rapidly consumed in battle. No matter how strong you are, there is a limit. You can’t possibly achieve a thousand-man move!”

“It wasn’t until the appearance of supers that some powerful supers were truly equipped with the ability of a thousand-man fighting machine.”

Li Hao was slightly dazed. He asked,””Captain, do you mean that only powerful supers can do this? does that mean that some weak supers can only kill ten or break a hundred?”

“Also?”

Liu Long looked at him and said with a mocking tone,”Just? You’ll know when you try! Breaking a hundred, one against a hundred! His speed and strength had both reached an extreme. This kind of superhuman also had some special abilities. Even if there were more than 100 martial masters, they would still have a slim chance of survival if they encountered this superhuman! Do you think it’s weak?”

Li Hao didn’t say anything.

Breaking a hundred ...

It didn’t sound difficult, but in fact, there was really a 100-man team on the other side, all of which were powerful soldiers. Li Hao would probably be hammered to death as soon as he charged in.
