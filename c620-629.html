        quickly nodded."Thank you for your guidance, senior!"
        Although he did not manage to get the details of the blood transfusion technique, He Yong had indeed given him a lot of advice, which made Li Hao very happy. He also realized that these old martial masters of Silver Moon might have some sect views and would not pass on secret techniques to others, but they would not mind sharing some basic insights with you.
        Hong Yitang was like this, and so was he Yong.
        This included Liu Long, who had given Li Hao nine sets of tempered force not long after. In some aspects, they were very generous.
        "You're welcome!"
        He Yong chuckled and looked at Li Hao, saying playfully,""I'm happy to see a powerful Martial Master! At the same time, you can also learn more about hou Xiaochen's strength. If his spear can't kill you, it means that his influence ... Mm, is still within my acceptable range!"
        "If you're killed by his gun, that means that this guy is extremely terrifying. I'd better get as far away from Silver Moon as possible."
        Li Hao smiled and nodded. He didn't mind being used as a test subject.
        "Senior, are there any martial masters in the central region who can match Xu Guang?" he asked after some thought.
        "I don't know,"
         "You don't know?"
        He Yong shrugged."Who knows? martial masters are all very low-key. After the rise of superpowers, martial masters are like grandchildren. Unless they convert to superpowers, they are all very low-key. I know about the three suns. Zhan Xuguang's ... I've never seen it before. However, that doesn't mean there isn 't. "
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "There might not be only one way for a Martial Master to go beyond the thousand-fold combat realm. Accumulating spirit might not be the only way!"
        He thought for a while and said,"for example, I know a person. This guy ... This guy might not be weak. Skysword has converted into a superpower and is extremely powerful in the light of dawn. That guy has not converted into a superpower but he is still extremely powerful ..."
        "Who is it?"
        "BA Dao!"
        He Yong said in a deep voice,"I saw BA Dao once seven years ago. That guy's one slash could shatter the heavens and earth! I'm sure he's not a superhuman, but a Martial Master! However, that day, he killed one of the three suns, even earlier than your master. It's been seven years, who knows how he is now. "
        BA Dao!
        "BA Dao's blade ... Gives me a feeling that his path is not ordinary! That guy didn't strengthen his body, didn't change his blood, and didn't strengthen his five internal organs. He's strengthening his saber intent and transforming it into a saber!"
        Li Hao fell into deep thought."Senior, what you mean is that BA Dao transformed himself into a blade. What he strengthened was divine intent and force. However, his body isn't that powerful, right?"
        "Not bad!"
        He Yong nodded again,"at that time, BA Dao gave me a feeling that his divine intent was invincible!" This guy's body isn't even as strong as mine. I suspect that if he didn't show his blade intent, I could've just punched him to death. "
        The strengthening force and divine intent were extremely powerful, regardless of the physical body ...
        Li Hao had learned something new.
        This was also a way of strengthening.
        In order to become more powerful, the martial masters were all moving forward. His teacher was not the only one who was exploring the path of martial Dao. Many of Silver moon's martial masters were also exploring.
        He Yong's strong vital energy and blood, his overbearing strong spirit intent, Heavenly Sword superpowers, teacher's five internal organs ...
        Every Martial Master of the older generation was walking on a different path.
        Even if they were converted to superpowers, these senior martial masters might not have really forgotten martial Dao. It was impossible for them to forget.
        The martial world was really interesting.
        Li Hao felt regretful that he didn't experience the martial arts world.
        BA Dao, Tian Jian, Nan Quan, San Qiang, and the three great commanders of the Wei Wu Army ... That era must have been very interesting.
        Of course, the current era was not bad either.
        The rise of the superpowers was actually filled with all sorts of mysteries.
        Li Hao did not look down on supers. Although he had killed some supers, it did not mean that he had the right to look down on them. Those powerful supers might be beyond his imagination.
        Li Hao and Southern Fist chatted for a long time.
         They talked about interesting things in the martial arts world. Southern Fist was talking while Li Hao was listening.  They talked about the power of martial masters in the past, and some gossip ...
        Before this, He Yong wouldn't talk to Li Hao about this, as he wasn't interested in it.
        But now, He Yong was very interested in chatting with him.
        But he couldn't even be bothered to look at Wang Ming.
        There was no other reason other than Wang Ming!
        Martial masters were very realistic.
        Li Hao was pulled to talk by He Yong because he had guessed that Li Hao had killed three suns. That was why the two of them had this conversation today.
        ……
        They chatted for a long time until the sky was almost dark.
        He Yong let out a breath and said happily,""I'm in a good mood today, kid. We had a good time chatting, although it's a bit of a pity that your teacher isn't here. "
        "Wu Lin, it's been a long time since we've had an outstanding junior. As a senior, I'll give you one last piece of information for free ..."
        Li Hao pricked up his ears.
        But this time, Nanquan chose to send a voice transmission instead of letting Wang Ming hear it.
        "Remember, if you want to comprehend more Shi, then stay in the Silver Moon! If he wanted to go further on the path of a Martial Master, he would have to stay in Silver Moon to become stronger! Silver Moon was a very special place! This place, a long, long time ago, might have been the center of the world! If any tree or grass here is old enough, it might be a place where some invincible Masters once comprehended ... Martial masters can only be stronger here!"
        "Countless people are coveting the Silver Moon! Hou Xiaochen hasn't left yet. I suspect that he's still on the path of a Martial Master, and he's not willing to leave until he's reached the end. "
        "In the past, not many people knew about it, but now, many people know about it! Some of the more powerful supers will soon come to Silver Moon ... Because Silver Moon might be hiding something that can solve the problems of the supers, as well as a treasure that can make the supers stronger again!"
        "This place will soon become the center of attention. Even if some people leave for a short time, they'll return soon enough. Your teacher will return, and even if hou Xiaochen leaves this time, he'll return ... The experts from the central continent will all come!"
        "Ying Hongyue, Yama King, Fei Tian, these people will all come to Silver Moon!"
        "The central region is just a path for them to strengthen themselves. The end point is the Silver Moon!"
        He Yong revealed a smile and finally sent a voice transmission,""Even the royal family will come! The royal family is actually inextricably linked to the Silver Moon. No one knows where the ruins excavated by the royal family are ... But I do have a vague idea that they might be in the Silver Moon!"
        Li Hao took a deep breath and looked at He Yong.
        He Yong laughed and said,""Let's go back. Martial masters ... Will rise one day! This land was the world of martial masters, in the past, and in the future ... It would still be! "Superhumans can become martial masters too, but they're still lacking something ... Some people have gone far on the path of superhumans, not because they gave up on the path of martial masters, but because they want to go further. They're very, very strong now. Once the trouble after the conversion of superhumans is resolved ... Soon, a group of senior martial masters will return!"
        Li Hao's eyes flickered, but he didn't say anything. He nodded and cupped his fists."Many thanks for senior's guidance!"
        "Let's go!"He looked at Wang Ming after saying that.
        Wang Ming was still a little confused, but he had heard the key point: superpowers could be turned into martial masters.
         He was immediately overjoyed. Although he wanted to ask more, seeing that Li Hao had left, he had no choice but to quickly follow him. With some joy, he whispered,""Supers can become martial masters. I'm rich now!"
        Li Hao was speechless.
        Did you forget the last sentence?
        Becoming a super Martial Master would be a little troublesome, and it had not been resolved yet.
        Did this guy choose to be obedient?
        ……
        Until Li Hao and the others left.
        He Yong watched them leave and suddenly smiled,""Martial Master ... Martial arts ... Jianghu!"
        This is what makes it interesting!
        "My Southern Fist will rise again in this ancient land. Wait for me!
       
        On this day, Li Hao didn't go out again after visiting the southern Fist sect.
        Li Hao needed some time to digest the words of the southern Fist.
        ……
        In the office.
        Li Hao held a pen in his hand and drew.
        Silver Moon, three northern provinces, Wulin, central ...
        During his time in the confidential room, Li Hao liked to read some files and collect information. Sometimes, he could speak well and give Li Hao many things.
        Silver moon's hidden experts had been hiding all this time.
        Perhaps hou Xiaochen's exposure was only one part of the plan.
        Li Hao wrote down a few names.
         Hou Xiaochen, Huang Yu, Kong Jie, and Zhao Chenguang.
        The leaders of the four organizations probably had a tacit understanding.
        Li Hao didn't believe it. These people didn't know each other's strength. It was said that director Zhao had always been against hou Xiaochen. Was this a double act, or was it because of the uneven distribution of loot?
        Or did they have a different opinion?
        The Wei Wu Army's three great commanders ... The Wei Wu Army was formed by the royal family back then. Did these people have any connections to the royal family?
        If hou Xiaochen was one of the three great commanders, would that be considered betraying the imperial family?
        Many thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind.
        Soon, he suppressed all of them.
        As long as he knew this in his heart, he didn't have to get to the bottom of it.
        However, he had to know his limits and not foolishly become someone else's chess piece.
        "Fire Phoenix spear, spear intent."
        Li Hao once again wrote down the fiery phoenix spear. Could he borrow the fiery phoenix spear?
        This was an origin god weapon.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Moreover, it was a very high-level origin god weapon. If he rashly went to borrow it, it would be a problem if he could borrow it.
        But now that hou Xiaochen seemed to value him, he might be able to.
        Strength was the foundation.
        The Ruins of Heaven battling city were still there, and hadn't been completely explored. At the end of this month or the next month, they might enter again to explore, and Li Hao knew that he might have some connection with heaven battling city.
        The eight great families should have some kind of relationship with heaven battling city.
        Li Hao also wanted a defensive origin god weapon. Although many people were eyeing it, Li Hao still needed the divine power stones in the city even if he couldn't get one.
        Besides the stone door and the origin divine weapon, the divine power stones were the simplest source of the small sword's sword energy.
        "Therefore, I have to become stronger before I enter again!"
        Although time was of the essence, Li Hao was unwilling to give up.
        At the current stage, he knew that the place with the most divine power stones was the heaven battling city ruins. As for other places, they might be more dangerous than the ruins.
        He wrote and drew for a while.
        Li Hao tore the paper into pieces, and the fire Tiger sword intent burned the paper into ashes.
        Even though he was not a superhuman, he was able to display some of his superhuman abilities with the fire Tiger sword essence.
        He still had 800 cubic meters of wood energy and 600 cubic meters of metal energy on hand.  Li Hao couldn't let these treasures stay idle. Apart from leaving 200 cubic meters of gold for Wang Ming, he didn't need to strengthen his five internal organs for the time being, but he could exchange the rest for some other mystical abilities.
        Li Hao knew the uses of the wind and lightning energy.
        At this thought, Li Hao stood up and walked out of the office.
        He didn't go next door to look for chief Yu. He didn't want to come into contact with this person now, the first generation Purple Moon ...
        Li Hao walked upstairs.
        In the office next door, Chief Steward Yu was dealing with official business. When he heard the commotion, he sensed it for a moment but did not pay much attention to it.
        As long as Li Hao didn't run around and kill people, no one would care what he did.
        ……
        On the fifth floor.
        Hao lianchuan was busy. When he saw Li Hao, he said hurriedly,""Do me a favor ..."
        "Do me a favor first."
        "Minister, help me exchange for some mysterious energy," Li Hao said.
        “……”
        Hao lianchuan was speechless.
        Can't you see that I'm busy?
        You actually came to me for such a small matter.
        "I got it from someone else. It's not convenient to find someone else."
        Alright, Hao lianchuan understood.
        "How much? What kind of energy?"
        " 1200 cubic meters, convert it to wind and lightning energy."
        Hao lianchuan frowned slightly and glanced at Li Hao. Why did this guy switch to wind and lightning energy?
        Previously, Yuan Shuo had changed a lot of the five elemental energy, and everyone guessed that it should be related to the five internal organs. Now that he had changed to the wind and thunder dual energy, they were a little puzzled.
        1200 cubic meters wasn't a lot.
        After some consideration, Hao lianchuan nodded and said,""Okay, I'll go to the warehouse to take a look later. If there are any, I'll give you a new one. There aren't many wind and thunder supers, so we don't use them often."
        "Then do me a favor. Didn't you say that the Scion of the blood God can strengthen the superpower lock?" I used my connections to get one at the glorious sun level. Can you try it first? if it's useful, I'll think of a way to get a more powerful one. If it's useless, won't it be a waste of effort?"
        Clearly, this person also wanted to become stronger.
         Everyone wanted to be strong.
        Those at the level of the sun glory were almost useless to him. However, if he could strengthen the Super Lock, even if it was just a little, it would give people hope.
        Many supers were actually facing this dilemma.
        It's easy to level up but if you can't see the superpower lock and break it, how can you level up?
        Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"sure. But I'll have to circulate my internal strength through your entire body and observe you carefully. Is that okay with you, department head?"
        He also wanted to thoroughly observe the situation of superpowers.
        Since it had come to his door, he would not be polite.
        According to the southern style, superpowers could be converted back.
        If that was the case ... It would be terrifying!
        If a portion of the extremely powerful supers could become martial masters again, what realm would those at the Sunglow level become martial masters?
       
        Also, how should he deal with the divine decree?
        Or should I say, become a Martial Master without the will of God?
        Even without the divine decree, it was still no small matter. After becoming a Martial Master, their physical bodies would be strengthened to an extremely terrifying extent. The divine decree ... Might not be the only path.
        A pure physical body-type Martial Master?
        Thinking of this, Li Hao was eager to try.
        Hao lianchuan thought about it for a moment, gritted his teeth, and nodded.""Alright, let's try! "To be honest, ever since I stepped into the three suns realm, I lost my motivation. I can't see the next superpower lock, which means that there's no way forward. Many supers will experience this situation after breaking the superpower lock they see. They will be muddled and live day by day. Anyway, this is their limit."
        Li Hao did not say anything.
        Just like the martial masters, there was no future for them after they entered the warrior dimension, and many of them were muddleheaded.
        However, the real elites would find ways to explore the future. If there was no path, then they would walk out by themselves.
        ……
         A Blood God's spawn appeared.
        Hao lianchuan was still a little nervous. He was actually a good-natured person, but this matter concerned his future. At this moment, he could not remain calm.
        Li Hao ignored him.
        At this moment, he released his inner strength and held Hao lianchuan's hands with both hands. The inner strength started to flow through his arms.
        In an instant, he was resisted by a mysterious fire energy.
        "Minister, suppress it a little!"
        "Good, good, good!"
        Hao lianchuan quickly nodded. He quickly suppressed the mysterious fire energy in his body.
        Although superpowers were not as simple as martial masters controlling inner strength, as an experienced three yang, Hao lianchuan's control was still good.
        Li Hao's inner strength began to move through his body with some difficulty.
        After walking around for a while, Li Hao frowned.
        The strength of his meridians was not weak, his flesh and blood were also very strong, and the hardness of his bones was also not bad ...
        However, he had many internal injuries.
        Yes, internal injuries.
        On his meridians, cracks of all sizes covered his entire body.
        This was the disadvantage of superpowers!
        His progress was too fast, and his mysterious energy was very aggressive. Except for a few strong people who had nourishing effects, most of the mysterious energy was mainly destructive.
        It was like a wooden bucket that could only hold 10 catties of water. If you poured water into it like crazy, it would not overflow but would be sealed. In the end, it would only burst the whole person.
        Superpowers ... Are very dangerous!
        It was Li Hao's first time examining a superhuman's body. He frowned.
        This was not a good thing.
        Once the supers exceeded the limit, these supers might explode on their own.
        "Superpowers ... Are they a dead end?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao fell into deep thought.
         However, that might not be the case.  Back in heaven battling city, that silver-tier elite had said that the path of superpowers was narrow. This meant that superpowers had existed in the ancient civilization.
        There were so many experts in the ancient civilization, and they were all terrifyingly powerful.
        If one was at the level of three suns or Sunglow, it would be a dead end. The threshold of superpowers was too low. The silver rank expert might not even mention it. Since he knew, the path of superpowers should have been somewhat famous in the ancient civilization.
        Even if it wasn't as good as martial arts, it wouldn't be too bad.
        Li Hao continued his investigation.
        Aside from the many hidden injuries on his body, he once again used his inner force to move through his five internal organs. Other than the fiery red Heart, which he did not dare to touch rashly, he quickly examined the other four internal organs.
        This look ...
        Li Hao's frown deepened.
        Of his five organs, the other four had hidden injuries. As for his heart, because his opponent had a fire power, he must have unlocked the heart's Super Lock. The burden of unlocking the heart's Super Lock was huge, and there was a lot of fire power. Although his heart had been strengthened, there were still some hidden injuries.
        How was this an expert!
        At this moment, Li Hao was speechless.
        He was severely injured!
        Of course, everything had not erupted yet, so Hao lianchuan was still a three-sun powerhouse. However, once he erupted, he would be dead.
        "Are hou bu and the others martial masters?"
        Li Hao fell into deep thought again.
        If hou bu and the others had turned into supers at the thousand-fighting stage, then quickly became stronger, and then turned into martial masters, then ... Would they have also been left with a lot of internal injuries?
        Therefore, his coughing was not necessarily an act.
        Also, at that time, in the meeting room, a group of sickly ghosts were all coughing ... It was fine if it was just one act, but was everyone pretending?
        "No... He might not be pretending!"
        He did not know that there were so many hidden injuries on the bodies of the supers.
        However, if hou Xiaochen and the others knew how to become martial masters, and had done so before ... But still had hidden injuries, could that explain why they were so powerful, but still had hidden injuries that had yet to be cured?
        Since Southern Fist said so, it meant that he might actually know how to convert it.
        In the central region, there were even people trying!
         Hou Xiaochen and the others might be the forerunners.
        At this moment, some of his doubts seemed to have been cleared.
        That room of sickly ghosts might really not be an act!
        "My five internal organs and lungs are damaged, so coughing is normal. If I nurture my lungs and they aren't strong enough, I might have the same situation. Teacher would also ..."
        Many thoughts appeared in his mind.
        Li Hao continued to investigate. The balance of his five internal organs had been broken. His heart was too strong. If this continued, his heart might explode, or his other four internal organs might be crushed by the powerful heart.
        "Li Hao?"
        At this moment, Hao lianchuan was a little upset.""Can you do it?"
        This fellow's inner strength was flowing through his body, making him feel a little uncomfortable.
        Li Hao came back to his senses and said,"take the blood God. Restrain your fire energy. The energy of the blood God ... Should be concentrated in your kidney!"
       
        "What?"
        "Your kidney is of water and your heart is of fire. Your fire is too strong. See if you can suppress it!"
        Hao lianchuan was a little speechless. But after thinking about it, he decided to forget it. He didn't understand these things, so he could only listen to Li Hao.
        A Blood God's spawn was quickly devoured by him.
        The power of the blood shadow exploded in his internal organs.
        At this moment, a wave of fire-elemental energy rapidly erupted and began to suppress, expel, and even destroy the power of the red shadow. Li Hao frowned slightly. As expected, the power of the red shadow and the mysterious energy were incompatible.
        They were even somewhat hostile!
        Not only that, the last time the blood Shadow Force had attacked the stone gate, it had also caused the eight great families to launch a combined counterattack.
        What the hell was this blood shadow power?
        Li Hao didn't think too deeply about it. He had too little information at the moment.
         "Suppress the fire energy!"
        "I can't control it anymore ..."
        "This ..." Hao lianchuan was also speechless."The energy of the blood God seems to be at odds with the mysterious energy. It was expelled as soon as it entered my body ..."
        "What?" Li Hao frowned."Try to absorb all the fire energy into your heart!"
        Alright!
        Hao lianchuan had to do as he was told. The source of fire energy was the heart.
        After a while, Hao lianchuan managed to suppress his fire element Energy.
        Li Hao's heart moved slightly. He used his inner strength to guide the power of the blood shadow into Hao lianchuan's kidney.
        The power of the blood shadow did not reject merging with the body.
        In an instant, a stream of blood could enter his kidney.
        At this moment, Li Hao's inner strength couldn't sense anything. He had an idea, but Hao lianchuan, who was opposite him, suddenly felt his hair stand on end.
        At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be very brutal!
        Divine decree!
        That's right, his inner strength didn't sense anything. Li Hao directly displayed his divine intent. A powerful sword intent burst out, but it was quickly restrained. Li Hao didn't use the fire Tiger intent, but the sword momentum.
        The Earth's sword momentum instantly covered Hao lianchuan.
        Hao lianchuan's scalp was numb. He wanted to speak a few times, but he held back in the end.
        He cursed in his heart. This kid is really scary.
        When a Martial Master reached the warrior dimension, their force would be able to intimidate the supers.
        At this moment, Li Hao's divine will entered Hao lianchuan's body.
        In his heart, the fire energy kept on going berserk as if it felt threatened. Sweat seeped out of Hao lianchuan's forehead."I ... Don't do anything stupid. I feel like my fire energy is going to explode!"
        "Wait a moment!"
        Li Hao didn't say much. The sword energy quickly entered his body. In the blink of an eye, it had reached his kidney. Hao lianchuan felt an explosion at his waist, and his face turned pale.  But at this moment, Li Hao saw something different.
        The blood energy in his kidney was being absorbed.
        With the help of his divine intent, he could indeed see a small, faintly discernible chain emerging. However, it was very weak. At this moment, it was absorbing the blood energy and was indeed growing stronger.
        Obviously, the reason why Hao lianchuan did not discover the fifth superpower lock was because the one in his body was too weak.
        Moreover, the fire energy in his heart was too powerful, and it had the effect of suppressing his five internal organs.
        Under the probing of Li Hao's divine will, it was revealed.
        Li Hao quickly obtained the divine decree and withdrew his inner strength.
        At the same time, the fire energy in Hao lianchuan's body also exploded. With a boom, the flames spread and the office caught on fire.
        Hao lianchuan could not care less about the backlash. He hurriedly put out the fire and extracted the fire energy. The fire energy in the office was cleared in an instant. He complained,""Don't mess around. Your Shi almost killed me!"
        This kid was too terrifying!
        Li Hao, on the other hand, was deep in thought.
        He looked at Hao lianchuan for a while and suddenly said,""Hao bu, can you feel if your kidney is stronger than before?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I can't feel it."
        Hao lianchuan shook his head."Can't you let the fire burst out in your body? it's easy to damage your five internal organs. I'm not a Martial Master, so I don't have your momentum. I'm also not like inner strength, which can flow through my body as I please."
        Superpowers could level up quickly, but mysterious powers did not have the effect of nurturing.
        It took a long time for a Martial Master to advance, but inner strength could nourish the entire body.
        Li Hao thought for a while."Superpowers might not be suitable for us to cultivate. It's not bad, but I feel that if we cultivate superpowers, it's best if our five internal organs are very strong, or even if we can transform them into energy."
        "What?"
        Hao lianchuan was stunned. Li Hao frowned and said,""There's a situation where one organ is very strong while the other four organs are very weak! The best way to solve this problem is to not let your power leak out. Your five internal organs will become an energy composite ..."
        After saying that, he shook his head.
        That wouldn't be considered human, would it?
         "There is an effect," he continued,"but the energy of the blood God is too little. It only strengthened the power lock in your kidney by a little. I'm afraid it won't work."
        "Is it really effective?"
        Hao lianchuan didn't care about that. He was very excited.""You saw it?"
        "Yes."
        "Is it a Super Lock?"
        "Of course, the superpower lock exists. It's just that it's strong and weak."
        Li Hao laughed."I've taken a look. It can be strengthened, but it doesn't mean that it's necessary to strengthen the kidney. Hao bu has broken the lock on his heart and three other limbs. He still has one limb that hasn't been discovered, right?"
        "Yes, I still can't find the Super Lock on my left leg."
        Li Hao nodded."Then strengthen your left leg. You can't strengthen your five internal organs first. Otherwise, it's very easy for a problem to arise. Your five internal organs are unbalanced and can easily be crushed."
        At this thought, Li Hao suddenly said,"now, Xu Guang has broken five superpower locks. Under normal circumstances, he will break one in the heart and four in the limbs. Therefore, it's not difficult for Xu Guang."
       
        "The difficulty lies in Sunglow!"
        Above the rising light, the second five organs Super Lock had to be broken.
        Li Hao was stunned again.
        Therefore, there might be some problems above sunguang, such as ... Coughing!
        This was because, after breaking the second five viscera lock, it was very likely that his five viscera would conflict. The two types of energy would conflict. His heart was fire and his kidney was water. At that time, after releasing the second type of mysterious energy, his five viscera would definitely be damaged!
        Li Hao was stunned.
        Did hou Xiaochen and the others ... Become martial masters, or did they break the second superpower lock in their organs?
        "Are there any existences above the rising light in the central region?" he asked hurriedly.
        "How would I know?"
        "I don't even know many xuguangangs ..." Hao lianchuan was speechless.
         Li Hao thought for a moment and changed his way of asking,""Are there some famous experts in the central continent who like to cough?"
        "You mean the Minister?"
        "What?" Hao lianchuan laughed."You can't become a strong person without coughing?"
        Li Hao fell into deep thought.
        If there were powerhouses above sunguang in the middle, they might also cough. Of course, coughing could be caused by lung damage, which was only one of the symptoms.
        If his heart was damaged, he might be pale and have insufficient blood supply.
        If the kidney was damaged, it might lead to impotence ... This was more secretive and not many people knew about it.
        Therefore, coughing was a more direct manifestation.
        If the other five internal organs were damaged, it might not be so obvious.
        For example, Kong Jie, he didn't cough much.
        It was very likely that it was not his lungs that were damaged, but other parts of his body. However, the degree of his injury was almost the same as the others, so there should not be a big difference in strength. The others coughed, but he did not ... This meant that, if his guess was correct, he had also broken the second shackle of the five internal organs.
        That's above Sunglow?
        At this moment, Li Hao finally understood.
        These people were either above sunguang, or ... Super-evolved martial masters!
        However, no matter which one it was, there was an imbalance in the five internal organs.
        So ... The accumulation of spirit was not simple.
        No, or rather, if his teacher could really improve the breathing technique of five birds and make it strengthen the five internal organs ...
        Li Hao secretly took a deep breath!
        If that really happened, there would be a terrifying undercurrent in the entire supernatural realm and the Martial Master realm.
        "Teacher ... Is in danger!"
        "No... Teacher is safe!"
        At this moment, Li Hao remembered something. He had said at the press conference that his teacher would try to improve the breathing technique of five birds and strengthen the five internal organs at the same time. Some people might not care, but some powerhouses who had broken the second shackle of the five internal organs would certainly care.
        They ... Must be paying attention to teacher!
         Everyone was silently watching Yuan Shuo, hoping that he could do it.  Why didn't the others try it themselves?
        There was no way for superpowers to try to improve their cultivation techniques, but martial masters had different paths. There might be people walking on teacher's path of strengthening the five organs, but it should be the teacher's path that was the most stable and the strongest!
        Li Hao suddenly laughed.
        Even Hao lianchuan was confused.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, was smiling happily.
        This meant that as long as his teacher's breathing technique of five birds had not been completely modified, there might be some top-notch experts who would secretly protect him.
        However, if his teacher really managed to modify it ... He might encounter some extremely terrifying dangers.
        Some experts might choose to take it by force.
        As for whether or not they could seize it ... That was hard to say.
        However, hoping that Yuan Shuo would spread it out himself was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.
        "Li Hao, are you alright?"
        Hao lianchuan felt a little strange. Li Hao smiled.""It's fine. I just figured out some things. It's very interesting. Indeed, senior Southern Fist was right. When you know a lot of things and follow the clues, you'll find that many things are very interesting in the end."
        What the hell?
        He didn't have the mood to care about this and hurriedly said,""Does this mean that I only need to consume enough clones of Blood God to see the fifth SuperLock?"
        "Right!"
        Hao lianchuan suddenly became excited.
        That's good!
        Li Hao suddenly thought of Ying Hongyue.
        Red shadow Force!
        What exactly was Ying Hongyue's purpose in gathering so many Red Shadows?
        It was as if ... He had somewhat understood.
        He could either become a Martial Master from a superpower or strengthen his superpower lock and balance the strength of his five internal organs. The blood Shadow's existence was not to create a group of powerful martial masters, but to eliminate some of the disadvantages.
         If Ying Hongyue also walked to the top of the rising light, then his five internal organs would also be unbalanced.
        Perhaps Ying Hongyue had already discovered this problem a long time ago.
        Therefore, he had been preparing for this for a long time.
        If that was the case ...
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao secretly took a breath. If there were enough Red Shadows, it might be possible to solve the problem of the imbalance of the five internal organs. Had Ying Hongyue already solved this problem? had she even gone far on the path of the five internal organs?
        Breaking the superpower lock of the four limbs and the five internal organs would make five superpower locks. Breaking five would make sunrise!
        If one wanted to be above sunguang, they had to break the second five organs Super Lock. As for the head ... Li Hao believed that few people would dare to do that, as the five organs were much safer.
        Therefore, when the five internal organs unlocked the second superpower lock, it was usually above Sunglow.
        And these people might have two superpowers.
        It was just that by looking at the Super Lock for Hao lianchuan, Li Hao suddenly realized that he might have found out some secrets.
       
        The secret of the blood shadow!
        His teacher said that the blood shadow was a puppet from the ancient civilization. Once it was absorbed, it would become stronger. Li Hao thought for a moment. It was very likely that Ying Hongyue had used the blood shadow to strengthen his Super Lock!
        Then, he had to maintain the balance of his five internal organs.
        "Li Hao!"
        Hao lianchuan couldn't take it anymore. Li Hao was smiling like a fox. What was he doing?
        Li Hao stood up and smiled."I'm fine. I'm really fine!" He said.
        "Director," he said,"I need some mystic energy. Just send it to my office."
        Then, he handed the two storage rings to Hao lianchuan and said,""Oh, right. Department head, I'll have to trouble you to help me check the information of all my teacher's students."
        "Ah?"
        Hao lianchuan was stunned. What was this?
         "I know a little. I have a few senior brothers and sisters," Li Hao said with a smile.
        Why?
        This was because he was thinking that the breathing technique of five birds might have attracted the attention of countless experts at this moment. However, those under the rising light did not care about this.
        If I were those powerhouses from the central continent, I might not be able to snatch it by force. What should I do then?
        He had obtained it through Yuan Shuo's disciple!
        Teachers were very fierce to ordinary people, but they were particularly fond of their own disciples. This was something that many martial masters could not avoid.
        Yuan Shuo had no children and did not have many disciples.
        People like Li Hao only said that he could absorb the mysterious energy, but Yuan Shuo immediately taught Li Hao the breathing technique of five birds.
        That Senior Sister had taught him the breathing technique of five birds, but his teacher had never mentioned it. It was obvious that he had tacitly agreed in the end.
        Therefore, everyone knew that Yuan Shuo was very good to his disciples. Even if he appeared to be fierce, he had a sharp tongue but a soft heart.
        If he had successfully improved the breathing technique of five birds, would he have taught it to his disciples?
        There was a high probability!
        Li Hao would definitely get it, and the others ... Including that Senior Sister, would probably get it.
        However, he definitely could not!
        At this moment, Li Hao understood that once the improved breathing technique of five birds was obtained by someone else, it would be a big problem. Some of the strong people would be able to reach the level of rising light.
        If someone were to obtain it, in order to prevent it from leaking out ... Killing Yuan Shuo was practically a matter of course!
        Hao lianchuan gave Li Hao a strange look, but in the end, he still nodded.""Alright, I'll help you look into it. It'll probably take a few days for me to get the specific information. I've actually looked into it before, but it was mainly about your teacher. As for his students, I have some information, but it might not be complete."
        "Yes, thank you!"
        "You ..." Hao lianchuan thought for a while and asked,"you're not thinking of joining them, are you?"
        "How could I!"
        Li Hao laughed."It's good to be a Night Watcher. Why should I leave?"
        After saying that, Li Hao hesitated for a moment, but he still said,""In addition, help me investigate the Bai clan, the Bai clan of white moon City! Not only the Bai family, but also all the experts related to Hu dingfang, especially those at the suguang realm, and ... Commander Huang Yu!"  Hao lianchuan took a deep breath.
        艹!
        What are you doing?
        Bai family, Huang Yu, what are you doing?
        Li Hao didn't say anything.
        What do you want to do?
        I want to see if anyone wants to borrow my Senior Sister to obtain the improved version of the breathing technique of five birds.
        In fact, Yuan Shuo had not managed to deduce it even now.
        However, Li Hao and some top-tier experts were likely to believe that Yuan Shuo could do it.
        There was no other reason. This person was truly talented.
        Not only that, but the breathing technique of five birds was a secret technique that he had been improving. Yuan Shuo also had a lot of knowledge of ancient books. This guy said that he was an archaeologist, but in fact, he was an expert in grave robbing!
        In fact, they were just digging graves.
        Otherwise, why would a Martial Master study archeology?
        Are you bored?
        Archeology was naturally to better excavate those historical sites!
        Yuan Shuo had been in Silver Moon for many years, and he had excavated many ancient sites there. These sites were especially numerous and important.
        A large number of important ancient documents had been destroyed by Yuan Shuo.
        He took a look at it. He could either destroy it or burn it directly. It could be said that Yuan Shuo was one of the evil people who had caused the collapse of the ancient civilization. He was responsible for it. Although he had dug it up himself, he had destroyed it and did not let others know. He was also a bad person.
        At this thought, Li Hao also thought of his Senior Sister, Hu dingfang, the Bai family, Huang Yu, and other relationships.
        If the breathing technique of five birds was really improved, his teacher must not pass it on!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Otherwise, it would be easy for something to happen.
         At this moment, he really wanted to contact his teacher. Unfortunately, it was said that his teacher was in Linjiang. He might have entered the three northern provinces by now, so he was unable to contact his teacher.
        ……
        Province mist.
        This place was surrounded by clouds and mist. No matter if it was day or night, there was always a heavy feeling of fog.
        In a high-class hotel.
        Yuan Shuo did not choose to stay in the wilderness this time. Instead, he chose a hotel.
        He even wore a pair of glasses and looked very refined.
        Beside her, Jade lightsaber was extremely awkward. Looking at the clothes she had changed into ... It was a professional short skirt. She had never worn such a thing in her life. Her eyes were filled with anger as she glared at Yuan Shuo.
        Yuan Shuo lit a cigarette and said with a smile,""Don't get angry. You're my assistant now! "As for me, I'm a professor at Linjiang college. My identity is real. This is an identity I made a long time ago ... No one can find out anything. We came to the three northern provinces to investigate the changes in the creatures in the sea ..."
        "Why can't you be normal?" Wu Hongjun was annoyed.
       
        "Normal?"
        Yuan Shuo laughed."I can't help it. The three northern provinces are in a mess now. There's no way to be normal."
        "It's a good thing that this place is chaotic. I'm just fishing in troubled waters. "He laughed.
        "There's no rush. Let's stay here for a few days. My second God is almost fully cultivated. The water Tiger is about to break out. I haven't fully recovered from my previous injuries, but now that we're close to the North Sea, I feel better ..."
        At this point, Yuan Shuo continued,"I've recently gained some insight. I've modified the breathing technique of five birds a little. The strength of the five internal organs is inconsistent and can't be balanced. This is the biggest disadvantage of the spirit accumulation technique!"
        Li Hao could avoid it with his sword energy, but he couldn 't.
        Moreover, he didn't know that Li Hao could use divine power stones to replenish his sword energy, which was why he had so little sword energy. He didn't think that continuing to use his sword could solve this problem. He had to solve it himself!
        Moreover, if the path of accumulating spirit power was to be popularized and officially accepted by all martial masters, a set of cultivation techniques that could accumulate the five internal organs was also necessary.
        Of course, Yuan Shuo wasn't that great.
        Even if he were to impart it, he would have to wait until his five internal organs and even his disciples had completed it before he could find a good Martial Master to impart it to.
         "You're changing again?"
        Wu Hongjun didn't care about the awkward clothes. He frowned and said,""If I remember correctly, you've been editing the novel since many years ago. You've edited many versions, right?"
        "Yes, but it's martial arts. As one's strength improves, one's comprehension will be different, and one's needs will be different. Naturally, one has to constantly improve. Do I have to keep eating my old capital?"
        Yuan Shuo laughed,"the secret techniques left behind by the ancient people may not be suitable for us! "We still need to modify it according to our own differences. I've had some ideas recently. If I succeed, the path of spirit accumulation will no longer be my own path. In the future, everyone can cultivate it. It doesn't matter even if there aren't five powers, as long as the five internal organs are in balance, it's the same with one power. Previously, only when the five powers were in balance could one cultivate it, and that was also to maintain the balance of the five internal organs.
        Wu Hongjun thought for a moment."You've modified it. Will you teach it to me?"
        "Of course I won 't!"
        “……”
        Wu Hongshan was speechless.
        This guy was really a piece of trash!
        Then what the hell are you saying!
        You even said you'd help me break through to the spirit accumulation stage. If you don't teach me, how am I supposed to break through to the spirit accumulation stage?
        Yuan Shuo chuckled."Don't be in such a hurry. Take your time to recuperate. If it doesn't work, change your blood first and strengthen your body. Take your time with your five internal organs! I'll teach you the old version after I'm done with it. The effect is actually not bad!"
        Old version!
        These words were very heart-wrenching.
        "It's done," he said cheerfully."I'll have to tell my student about it. Although he might not need it, if that fellow learns it, there's a chance he can merge the five Forces!"  Wu Hongjun was speechless. He asked,"when can you get it done?"
        "Soon. In a few days. Let me first fuse the five Forces. Now that I've fused two forces, the third force should be coming soon. I'll also get some clones of the blood God. I've already fused the fourth and fifth forces. I think it should be about time."
        Wu Hongjun no longer said anything.
        A Scion of the blood God was not bad either.
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, fell into deep thought. The effects of the blood deity's ability to fuse the five internal organs were actually quite good.
        Like Li Hao, he also had some vague thoughts.
        The blood God ... Was it something that Ying Hongyue used to balance her five internal organs?  However, did superpowers need to balance the five organs?
        In order to break more superpower locks?
        At this moment, he actually thought of a lot and vaguely felt some danger. The old Devil's sense of danger was still very strong, and as the five Forces merged into one, he gradually felt that the supers might also be in urgent need of a treasure or cultivation technique to balance the five organs.
        Yuan Shuo stood in front of the window and looked around.
        It was a pity that Li Hao wasn't here.
        Otherwise, that kid seemed to be able to see things that others couldn 't. Perhaps he could help her see if there were people watching her.
        A moment later, Yuan Shuo revealed a smile.
         Whether or not he did ... He would find out very soon.
        He was not too afraid.
        He was very good at escaping from death.
        "Jade light, I'll bring you to do a big business later. Three suns is too trashy. The three northern provinces used to be the nest of the three major organizations. Maybe there's Xuguang ... Not afraid of death, I'll bring you to do a big business!"
        Wu Hongjun's face turned blue. After a long time, he nodded,""Alright!"
        If you're not afraid, why should I be?
        Sunguang ... Is this guy going crazy again?
        Yuan Shuo chuckled. He wasn't crazy, but maybe someone would help him.
        I've already said that if the five Forces merge into one, I have a chance to derive the new version of the breathing technique of five birds ... If someone is watching me, they must be anxious. Maybe I can even pick up Xuguang's Blood God!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com -
       
        Li Hao didn't communicate with anyone else.
        In the office.
        Li Hao began to practice the ninth-stage golden ROC Fort diligently. He wanted to reach the ninth-fold as soon as possible.
        He was not too worried about his teacher.
        Moreover, his teacher's progress might be even faster than his.
        This was because Yuan Shuo had long since fused his Five Forces. Unlike Li Hao, who had to start from the beginning, Yuan Shuo had now grasped the method. What he needed to do was simple. Strengthen his five internal organs and then fuse his forces. That was all!
        Li Hao, on the other hand, needed to build his Foundation.
        Yuan Shuo's Foundation had long been extremely solid. In the current martial arts world, who had more force than him, and who was stronger than him?
        Even the so-called BA Dao had been inferior to Yuan Shuo in the past, and now ... Li Hao felt that he was inferior to him as well!
        "My physical fitness is sufficient for nine stacks, but I'm still lacking in experience and comprehension ..."
         Li Hao tried again and again, and his attacks caused loud cracking sounds.
        The steward Yu next door was very annoying!
        Li Hao had come again.
        Ever since Li Hao moved next door, although he was a homebody, he was too much of a homebody, which was why he was so annoying. He didn't leave all day and night, and when he had nothing to do, he would practice martial arts. When he did, it was impossible for there to be no sound.
        She had had enough of this guy!
        Originally, she had wanted to take Li Hao to the Wei Wu Army tomorrow, but this was also hou Xiaochen's arrangement.
        But now, Chief Steward Yu only wanted to send this guy away immediately!
        Yes, send him to the Wei Wu Army!
        The headquarters was filled with supers. To Li Hao, it was indeed boring here. Perhaps it would be better if he went to the Wei Wu Army.
        ……
        "Pa pa pa!"
        Li Hao was still punching. Since he didn't have any other insights, he might as well give him another 30000 to 50000 punches. He didn't believe that he wouldn't improve.
        Li Hao didn't care if other people's bodies couldn't take it.
        The wind and lightning energies would be sent over very quickly.
        He wasn't afraid of his physical body being damaged!
        The current him could only stack seven times. Li Hao felt that if he hit 100000 times, he might be able to stack nine times. The captain had practiced martial arts for many years, but Li Hao felt that the captain might not have used all his strength and hit 100000 times!
        If that was the case, his arm would have been completely crippled.
        If he didn't have enough talent or time, he would have to work hard to make up for it.
        As long as he worked hard, he could make up for it!
        If others knew what Li Hao was thinking, they would probably die from shock.
        Make up for it?
        Was Li Hao stupid?
        If he was stupid, he wouldn't have been able to comprehend three types of Shi so quickly.
        You're not afraid of someone being smarter than you, but you're afraid of someone being smarter and more talented than you, and then ... They'll work harder than you. If that's the case, the people behind you can only despair.
         There was no need to be afraid of being talented or smart. As long as these people didn't work hard, the people behind them would catch up sooner or later.  However, when such a person was ten times more hardworking than you ... You would have no way out.
        Li Hao was still fighting.
        There was a knock on the door.
        Li Hao had sensed it a long time ago, but he thought that general manager Yu had gone to the sixth floor. Hou Xiaochen had already come out of seclusion, so why didn't you two get intimate? why did you come to find me?
        "Come in!"
        Chief Steward Yu pushed the door open and entered. Seeing that Li Hao was sweating all over, she frowned slightly. She didn't like the smell of sweat from martial masters ... The Marquis Department was very good. Every time they finished their practice, they would quickly wash up, and the smell was very good.
        Li Hao wasn't stinky, but ... He looked really ugly when he was sweating.
        Li Hao naturally didn't know what she was thinking. If he did, he would probably have slapped her ... Provided that he could win.
        "Chief, why are you here?"
        Li Hao laughed and wiped his sweat with a towel.
        Chief Steward Yu's expression did not change. He dodged the sweat that he had thrown away and said coldly,""The Head of the Department asked you to make a trip to the Wei Wu Army. If you're interested, you can stay there. I'll Take You There."
        "Now?"
        "Right!"
        "It's already dark ..."
        Li Hao looked out of the window, and then at the clock in the office that he had bought with his own money."I'll get off work in five minutes."
        “……”
        Chief Steward Yu was speechless. She frowned slightly."Li Hao, you're a Martial Master, not a real worker!"
        It was fine if it was a few times, but it was very annoying to do this every day.
        Li Hao smiled and said,"sure, but when will my position as the city Patrol be confirmed?" After becoming an official, I naturally had to work overtime. I learned from Hao bu every day and could work overtime until dawn. As for work ... Isn't it the same now?"
        Chief Steward Yu gave him a strange look.
        Li Hao seemed to be much bolder now.
        Or rather, his true face was revealed.
        Before this, Li Hao had always been cautious and polite when he saw her.
         "We're almost there,"
        Chief Steward Yu frowned."The position of City Patrol not only requires the consent of the Marquis but also the approval of Secretary Kong. Then, you will get the approval of the administrative Bureau. Only then can you be promoted. The dynasty still exists, and the system is still perfect. It is not up to someone to decide!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A City Patrol was considered a high-ranking official.
        If the dynasty collapsed and silver Moon became independent, hou Xiaochen would naturally be the one to call the shots. However, that was not the case right now, and they still had to go through the process.
        "Alright then!"
        Li Hao put on his clothes."Then let's wait a little longer. I think it'll be soon. The inspection Division and the administration Bureau won't dare to not give Minister hou face."
        Chief Steward Yu was too lazy to say anything.
        He strode out of the office, and Li Hao quickly followed.
        Chief Steward Yu didn't feel like talking, so he went downstairs.
        Li Hao chuckled as he followed them. As he walked, he said,""Chief, it's not that I'm asking for anything, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. The Marquis has only sent me here, but up until now, not a single mission has been given. I think that I am too free. After I am promoted, perhaps the Marquis will pay more attention to me. "
       
        Bullshit!
        However, when hou Xiaochen had Li Hao come to white moon City, he had indeed not arranged for him to do anything.
        As for killing Yu Xiao, it was Hao lianchuan who asked for his help.
        "Soon!"
        "The Head of Department asked you to come," chief Yu said coldly."Naturally, he didn't ask you to stay idle all the time. He must have an important task for you, and also to protect you."
        "Well, that's good. I told the Minister to shoot wherever he pointed! I've already sold my life to the Minister. We're all on the same side, don't you think so?"
        Chief Steward Yu ignored him.
        Li Hao didn't care. While walking, he smiled and said,""Chief, I heard that there is a special energy in the origin god weapon. If you absorb it, you can become stronger very quickly, and it's also safe. Is that true?"
        "Somewhat."
        "Do we night patrollers only have one origin god weapon?"
         "Yes."
        "Can I borrow it for a few days?"
        “……”
        Chief Steward Yu turned around and looked at Li Hao with a cold expression.
        Did this guy think that he was going to ascend to the heavens?
        He even dared to speak like this?
        The fiery phoenix spear was a top-tier origin god weapon. Although it might not be comparable to some of the treasures in the central continent, it was still the number one origin god weapon in Silver Moon. Li Hao had only been here for a few days, and he already dared to ask for an origin god weapon?
        "Li Hao ..."
        Li Hao said seriously, everything is for the Minister! I want to become stronger and become the Minister's right hand man, not be protected by the Minister and become a burden to the Minister!"
        "I want to become a strong warrior like the chief Steward so that I can give more support to the Minister, unlike Hao bu, who only holds the Minister back and can only do small things. He can't participate in any big things and can only let the Minister personally participate!"
        Chief Steward Yu frowned and said nothing.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Was there something wrong with that?
        No!
        However, it was a little uncomfortable to hear.
        It was a good thing that Hao lianchuan was not by her side. Otherwise, she would have died of anger.
        Chief Yu frowned slightly."The fire Phoenix spear is not only a weapon. It is also the foundation for the advancement of superpowers. It is extremely important. We can't afford to lose it ..."
        Li Hao nodded and said,"I understand!" Don't worry, unless I die, I won't lose it. If I die, it means that someone has killed their way to white moon City and snatched the fire Phoenix spear from under the eyes of the Marquis. Then there's nothing we can do. Don't you think so, chief?"
        Chief Steward Yu had originally wanted to say that he could not lend it to others.
        However, at this moment, she was suddenly speechless.
        "I'll go ask the Marquis later,"she said after a while.
        "Don 't. Who among the night patrollers doesn't know that the Marquis department only listens to the chief?"
        Li Hao's smile was brilliant."With just one word from you, chief, the Marquis will definitely agree. It's just a small matter!"
        Chief Steward Yu was speechless.
        She ignored him and walked away.  Li Hao followed him again."Chief, I'm just borrowing it. I'm not taking it away. Let me broaden my horizons. Didn't the Marquis say so?" I'm too inexperienced. I've never seen an origin god weapon before. "
        Chief Steward Yu frowned and said as he walked,""Wait for the news!"
        He was waiting for news again!
        Waiting for news meant that there was no news.
        How could Li Hao agree? he hurriedly said,"then forget it. I won't trouble the Minister and the supervisor. I'll take leave tomorrow. I want to go to the barracks and the Silver Moon Army."
        "What?"
        "Go and find commander Yu!"
        Li Hao said excitedly,"my teacher and commander Yu are friends. Commander Yu is also an expert and the commander of the three armies. He must have an origin god weapon ... I'll go and borrow it."
        ,m Chief Steward Yu's expression changed slightly. He turned around and looked at Li Hao with a sharp gaze."Are you ... Threatening me or something else?"  What did that mean?
        Li Hao bared his teeth and laughed."No, I didn 't! I just feel that the origin god weapon might help me comprehend some martial Dao true intent. I need to improve myself, not be a piece of trash that just sits around and does nothing. Of course, I'll try to borrow it from wherever I can. So what if I'm in charge? can't I borrow it?"
        Chief Steward Yu was a little annoyed!
        Li Hao had looked honest before, but now that they had gotten to know him, they realized that he was not honest at all!
        His words just then had clearly been to say that hou Xiaochen's refusal meant that he wasn't giving him a chance. He wanted to restrict and suppress him.
        Since that was the case ... He wanted to look for an opportunity in the Army!
        Was this a threat?
        Not really.
        But ... Chief Steward Yu did not like this feeling. After a while, he said coldly,""Alright, I'll lend it to you. But, for three days at most!"
        "Many thanks!"
        Li Hao hurriedly thanked him, his face full of excitement.
        His heart was very calm.
        It was a good thing that he managed to borrow it, but it didn't matter if he didn 'T. He was just testing the tolerance of these people. He also wanted to see if the military and the night watchers were really as close as family.
        Now, it seemed that it might not be the case.
         Perhaps there were some conflicts or conflicts of interest between them.
        Hu dingfang had invited him to join the Tiger wing Army several times, but the night patrolmen had never agreed to let him go. Although it had something to do with Li Hao's own choice, it also represented the night patrolmen's attitude.
        ……
        Minister hou's car was waiting outside the door.
        Li Hao sat in the front passenger seat, while Chief Steward Yu sat in the back.
        It was very quiet in the car.
        The Wei Wu Army was obviously not here.
        Li Hao didn't ask where it was, but he would know when they arrived.
        He was a little curious about the Wei Wu Army, but not that much. An Army made up of martial masters might have many experts and even many Qian fighters, but ... As long as they were not famous martial masters, Li Hao didn't care.
        It wasn't that the more famous a Martial Master was, the stronger he would be. However, martial masters were all unique. If a Martial Master didn't participate in battles often, how could he become stronger?
       
        If he didn't make a name for himself, how could he fight with people of the same level?
        If they didn't fight, how could they gain momentum?
        If all the martial masters in the military were made from the same mold, such a Martial Master would not be worth mentioning even if he had reached the warrior level.
        Back then, the three great commanders had also become famous throughout the world, which was why people felt that they were powerful.
        How could he be strong without fighting?
        Majordomo Yu didn't want to speak, and neither did Li Hao. He closed his eyes to rest and didn't even look at the road. However, the will of God kept lingering around him, making the driver feel uncomfortable.
        Behind him, Chief Steward Yu's eyes also flickered slightly.
        Sword force!
        Li Hao's swordsmanship was quite good. In the past, he would have made a name for himself in Silver Moon martial forest. However, he didn't expect Yuan Shuo to misjudge so many students, and to find such a treasure in his old age.
        The car drove all the way north.
         The night patrollers 'headquarters were located in the southern city, while the inspection office's headquarters was located in the northern city.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Wei Wu Army was in the North?
        It's so far away. Doesn't hou Xiaochen usually go?
        At this moment, in the carriage, Chief Steward Yu opened his mouth,""There are very few guards, less than 1000 people in total. In reality, there are only 980 people, a total of nine 100-man teams. The rest of them were incorporated into the guards directly under the chiliarch."
        "There are a total of 9 Centurions, all of whom are low-level City Patrol envoys."
        "A chiliarch, an advanced city Patrol."
        "Almost all the members of the Wei Wu Army are patrols."
        " 980 people. Less than 100 of them are at the tenth realm. The rest are all over 100!"
        Li Hao was shocked. So strong?
        However, after thinking about it, it was normal. In this era, mystery was enough. It was not difficult to break through 100. What was difficult was to break through 100 perfectly.
        Thinking of this, Li Hao asked, is it a lot to break through 100?
        "Quite a few, close to a hundred."
        Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly. It was quite a lot. This meant that 100 people had comprehended force, which was not a small number.
        He was stronger than he had imagined!
        Li Hao originally thought that the Wei Wu Army would be lucky to have a few dozen martial masters who had comprehended Shi. He didn't expect that there would be nearly a hundred people, and this didn't include the Centurions and chiliarchs. Those people were definitely Qian Douluo.
        "Right, there's also a vice-captain ... The Wei Wu Army has 11 master Warriors!"
        There were nine Centurions, two chiliarchs, and 11 thousand-man fighters.
        Li Hao was silent for a while, then asked,"how does it compare to the southern style?"
        "It's better. "
        "I'm talking about the captain ..."
        "It's hard to say,"
         Chief Yu pondered for a moment and said,"if he Yong hadn't broken through to the Qian warrior realm in the past, there's no need to talk about it. But now, He Yong hasn't used his full strength either, so it's hard to judge. Martial masters have to fight with each other to be able to judge."  "Have you fought with the three suns?"
        "The two captains have fought!"
        Li Hao understood. This meant that the two chiliarchs were not ordinary Qian duels. The remaining Centurions were at the peak of the radiant sun realm at best.
        He was very strong, but he was just ... Average.
        "By the way, there are military formations in the Army, and once they join forces, they will be much more powerful than they are now. The Wei Wu Army's current goal is to surround and kill Xuguang with a thousand people!"
        Li Hao nodded.
        "You're not curious?"
        "It's just an army formation, what's there to be curious about?"
        Li Hao smiled."It has existed since ancient times. It's also recorded in the ancient civilization. Once a formation is formed, one's strength can possibly double." The ancient civilization also recorded that there was a formation that was very powerful. The power gathered on one person, and a thousand people borrowed the power. For example, with a thousand-man commander as the eye of the formation, the power of a thousand people gathered on one person. Let alone dealing with Sunglow, even those above Sunglow would have hope ... It seems that the Marquis tribe didn't obtain such a powerful formation?"
        This was the truth. Ancient books had mentioned it. Li Hao knew a lot of ancient books, although his teacher had forced him to memorize them.
        Chief Steward Yu suddenly felt a little uncomfortable.
        The things that she thought were very important to Li Hao were worthless to him.
        Of course, Li Hao wasn't the only one who felt this way.
        She couldn't help but think of the past ... Back then, there was also a fellow like this in the martial arts world. He knew everything you said. You felt that your secret skills were extremely powerful, and he could list out countless secret skills that were stronger than you.
        That's right, that person was Yuan Shuo.
        A guy who made people gnash their teeth in hatred!
        Yuan Shuo had been well-learned since he was young, and everyone in the martial arts world knew this.
        He knew a lot of things and had read a lot of miscellaneous books. Later, he was not satisfied with modern books and began to think about ancient books, so he began his archaeological journey.
        At that time, he knew even more.
        Now, Li Hao was more and more like Yuan Shuo.
         Demon Yuan had just made a comeback, and now there was a little demon li?
        Chief Steward Yu instantly lost interest and stopped talking.
        You'll know when you get there!
        ……
        The car drove in the city for nearly half an hour, then began to drive towards the northern suburbs.
        "There is a sea in the northern suburbs ... But it's only a branch of the North Sea and can't be considered a real sea. The North Sea runs through the continent and separates the North from the middle. The Silver Moon territory is only a small branch, and we usually call it the moon sea."
        "From the moon ocean, we can actually reach the North ocean by sea, or even the central region ... But it's not safe. There are Pirates and water bandits in the ocean, so it's not as safe as the land."
        "The Wei Wu Army is stationed near the moon ocean. The land there is vast but the population is sparse. It's suitable for martial masters to practice martial arts. After all, it's quite a big commotion if thousands of martial masters practice martial arts."
        When they were about to arrive, Chief Steward Yu introduced them to Li Hao.
        Li Hao's interest was piqued, and he said,""Chief, so you're saying that the base is by the sea?"
