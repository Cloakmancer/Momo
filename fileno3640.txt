One day, when the chaos is destroyed, you will win!Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry."Then ... I can't be like this, right?"What a joke!How childish!"What's the big deal?"the human King laughed. It's good to live to your heart's content. For example, you can set a goal. Don't you like to study Dao? Just look, look through a hundred million chaos DAOs ... Who said there were only ten thousand? That bootlicker of yours ... Is that Dao one of the ten thousand time DAOs? Farting was also a Dao, cursing was also a Dao, killing was also a Dao, everything could be a Dao! Dao is endless, one begets two, two begets three, three begets all things, all things begets all things ..."Li Hao was stunned.He looked at the human King and was speechless for a long time.The human King laughed again."I don't really like fighting. Even if he has given me a lot of help, and the opportunity for me to rise to power lies in fighting, I don't like him! "Even if many people admire him, I don 't. He left behind too many messes. He thought that he stood at a very high position. He gave up everything and thought that the filth of the world had tainted him ... What a ridiculous fellow!"The human King was extremely proud,'he's an irresponsible person! "I don't like him. No matter how hard it is for me, I won't give up. I won't give up the responsibility that I, Fang ping, should bear! I don't care how many things he left behind, I don't care how powerful his talent is, I don't care how aloof he is from the world, he ... Is just a coward!""Li Hao, I don't want you to follow his path. But now ... It seems that perhaps ... The influence you've received is beyond your imagination. After you resurrect your family and become invincible in chaos, perhaps ... You'll be like him, invincible and heading toward death!"Li Hao slightly frowned and was silent for a while.""Maybe, but ... I don't think I'll go that far.""I don't need your opinion. I'm fine with it!"The human King was as domineering as ever.It was so domineering that even Li Hao was not used to it."Alright, I know you might not listen to me, but it's okay ... You can die as you wish! Good words can't persuade a dead person. You just have to remember that if you want to die, you have to give me everything you can use before you die. "‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"That ... I don't think so!" Li Hao's mouth twitched.Go to hell!He had always respected this old senior.Today, he wanted to curse.Go to hell!If I die, I'll leave the things to you?What are you thinking!Stop dreaming!   Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã The human King smiled and patted Li Hao again.""Hmm, it seems that you don't want to die in the short term. It's okay, I'll wait for you!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was speechless and a little tired.Very quickly, he changed the topic."Senior human King, I'll take my leave first. The square region might not be safe either. It's best to give up for the time being. There are still some tribulations and Tian Fang's arrangements here. It might not be impossible for them to descend again ..."Rest assured, leave this place to long Zhan first!"The human King laughed."Long Zhan refused to leave. Tianfang took root here. Neo martial took a foothold here. Zhan Tiandi could travel through the past and the future, but he didn't leave here and take neo martial away ... You were also born here ... This Sifang region might not be simple! Perhaps the root of the chaos great Dao was here. Perhaps, the edge of chaos was right here! Perhaps the core of chaos is here ... In short, the square domain is not simple!"He wasn't as reckless as others thought. At this moment, he was smiling like a fox,""Let long Zhan guard this place first. Long Zhan rose up here and obtained the spirit of chaos. Obviously, the four-sided domain is different ... How did he get it? Where did you get it? Could it be that a Chaos Beast could obtain it? That's impossible! So ... Just wait and see. In the future, if a level 9 martial artist can descend, the four regions will be lively again!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao's heart trembled. The human King was indeed not a brute, but ... Forget it. Even if he wasn't a brute, he was still a hooligan. Hooligan had nothing to do with intelligence. His behavior was that of a hooligan.A gangster from the chaos!Li Hao nodded and said nothing more."Then I'll go back first. I still have to send her back."Over ten thousand spiritual bodies were still here.The human King smiled and nodded."Alright. Oh right ... I have a big plan recently that I want to complete with you. Are you interested?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhat?"Kill who?" Li Hao was puzzled.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe human King was speechless,'kill who? You don't have any other interests other than killing people? I want to build a sky screen that is filled with chaos. Didn't you build one in Silver Moon? Just nice, didn't you want to build the heavenly Daoist sect? It just so happens that ... We can hang a sky screen at the entrance of each secret realm and broadcast the chaos!" The human King smiled,"that's good!" Next time, fight, kill, and stream chaos! The chaos was so boring. If he wanted to find fun, he had to find it himself! Also, I have an idea. We can rent a place in your heavenly Dao field and set up the live streaming platform. It's just inside, and even spiritual bodies can watch!"The more the human King spoke, the more excited he became,'you're discussing Dao every day, and you're not going to fight? It's so boring. What I mean is, for example, today's scene can be played on loop to show those venerable sovereigns how we kill people and kill level nine!""There are many benefits. First, let the chaos monarchs know us!""Second, let them know how powerful we are. They won't dare to provoke you. They'll be afraid whenever they see you ... Yes, to be a ruthless person, you have to be afraid.""Third, give everyone some benefits. Let them see the battle of the ninth-rank. They may not have the chance to participate in this life."

Chapter 3641 Interesting Soul (3)
"Fourth, with the live broadcast of the battle of the ninth rank ... You can recruit more people. It's also a gimmick of the heavenly Daoist sect. Others are embarrassed to do so and are afraid that others will see the truth. I'm not afraid either! Live broadcast, on repeat!""Number five, to subdue an enemy without a fight, when my neo martial arts and you, Silver Moon, pass, everyone will bow down and submit. Are you unhappy?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was stunned and fell into deep thought.The human King's words weren't very reasonable, but the reason he gave wasn't made up.Li Hao fell into deep thought."Chaos is boring," Ren Wang said."Only when there are more interesting people will chaos be interesting! I've realized that chaos, including you, is very boring. As for me, I like interesting people, and I like interesting souls even more!""This way, the information will be clear and everyone will know. Of course ... I can still pretend!"The human King winked,'showing off in front of the people is the real thing, walking in brocade clothes at night is boring! I'm already invincible, and no one knows about me. Are you bored? If you don't show your divinity in front of the masses, what kind of cultivator are you? who in the pugilistic world doesn't pursue a name?"He laughed again,'the primal Chaos ranking, every scene is a list! For example, the human King was first, the Silver Moon King was second, and Tian Fang was third ... Once the rankings were out, he could use Tian Fang's name to spread his own name ... Of course, no one would believe this. He would first exclude the ninth rank and let chaos know who to follow and who would have a bright future! The rankings might not be true, but what would some ignorant fellows know? Does everyone know that huntian is stronger than me? I don't think so! You're new to Silver Moon, what do you know? Do you know who is more powerful? But look at a list that everyone is looking at. Li Hao is first! Do you believe me? Even if you don't believe it, you'll know that Li Hao is number one ... This is beneficial to your rule!""You have a heavenly Daoist field, but you don't know how to make use of it. It's a pity. If it were me, I would have let the entire chaos know that I'm invincible in this chaos! Following me is the right path, winning the hearts of the people and winning the world! You see, this time, you've gathered 10000 spiritual bodies and you've become stronger. Why? Because of the heavenly Daoist sect, where are you going to get the spirit of the myriad Dao Emperor?""This is the fame and fortune of chaos!"This time, Li Hao was really impressed!After a long time, he nodded."I understand. I've learned!"Although the human King was out of tune, when he got serious, even though he was still out of tune, it had to be said that some of his ideas were correct.In the establishment of the sky screen system, the human King's other aspects might be secondary, but the key was to act cool ... However, for Li Hao, the sky screen system was indeed useful. In the past, it had been very convenient for him in Silver Moon.Secondly, it would be broadcasted in the heavenly Daoist Rite ... That's right, some teaching materials were actually very necessary for the Dao discussion!As for who the protagonist was, it didn't matter. The human King was just trying to act cool. He didn't care about that.The ranking ... Was a little interesting, but it didn't mean much. The human King was also trying to pretend to be No. 13 ... However, it might attract some people, which was actually useful.For example, if the world where some type 9 powerhouses lived had just recovered and saw the powerhouses 'ranking ... Would they directly come to find them?This way, he could increase his income.Many thoughts emerged in Li Hao's mind. The human King's suggestion was actually not bad, but the premise was that the human King's idea had to be eliminated. His idea was to show his divinity in front of the masses, and everything else was secondary.This was ... An expert who was confident to the bone."Alright, it's good that you understand. If you understand, I'll get the God forger to send you some sky screens later, the upgraded version. In the chaos, the old version can't work anymore. You need a new version!"The human King chuckled."You have to know that in order to create these, the divine creators have spent hundreds of years on this. A lot of the resources that I, neo martial, have plundered have been invested in this ..."Li Hao was speechless! Was there a need to?I'm really convinced by you, old ... Person!As long as the human King didn't die, there would be no end to the chaos.This was truly a disaster that would last for a thousand years!"Let's go ..."Li Hao turned around and left. The human King warned,""Remember, it's fine if you forget the rest. Just keep the rest in mind and do it quickly before the ninth-rank returns! Tell me if you're lacking anything, hurry up ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was speechless. He immediately left with his men.I'm scared of you!This old man ... Forget it, be more polite. Senior human King is really childish.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Alliance City nine.The secret realm of the heavens.When the spiritual bodies returned, the venerable sovereigns were all very excited. Although some of their spiritual bodies had been destroyed, most of them had returned safely.At this moment, who would still care about those people? They were so excited that they were a little excited!Killing tribulation, killing life and death emissaries, forcing the five elements, forcing long Zhan, huntian ...Surrounding and attacking Tian Fang ...It felt so good to see all these legendary figures today!It was too exciting! Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  The entire secret realm was like a wet market. The venerable sovereigns 'spiritual forms were like wet market aunties. At this moment, they were noisy and discussing animatedly. They were reminiscing endlessly. They had all participated in this, but at this moment, they were all talking about their own feelings as if no one else had participated!Li Hao looked at the lively scene and suddenly laughed.Perhaps ... The human King was right.Chaos was boring, but when interesting people made chaos interesting, then chaos would be interesting.

Chapter 3642 An Interesting Soul (3)_5
For example, now!A group of venerable sovereigns usually consisted of five or six people, but now?Whether it was the seventh-level or the eighth-level, at this moment, they were all like aunties on the street, talking with red faces and vivid voices ... Even if everyone present was participating, they were actually listening with great interest.Was this ... The true cultivation?Cultivation was not necessarily quiet and uneventful. Perhaps, it was lively?Everything was Dao!Liveliness was the way, quietness was the way, and where was not the way?Noise was a Dao, silence was a Dao, and silence was also a Dao.In the current chaos, there were few people who could speak to Li Hao in such a way, and even those who were qualified might not say so. The human King was truly a wonderful and interesting person!"Everything is Dao, everything is Dao ..."Li Hao mumbled and instantly disappeared.Billions of great DAOs?The human King really dared to think about it, but ... Thinking about it, didn't he find it interesting?Every blade of grass and every tree was a Dao!Even peeing was a Dao ... Farting was really a Dao, a Dao that led to the heavens!The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it made sense. It was really interesting.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Alliance City nine.Venerable sovereigns appeared one after another. Some were injured, some were excited, some were chatting, and some were counting the spoils.This time, Silver moon's harvest was not small.Seeing that Li Hao had arrived, everyone was somewhat excited."Lord Marquis!"Hu Qingfeng didn't care about the occasion. He came up and smacked,"Lord Marquis is unparalleled, killing a type 9 with a sword, invincible in the world ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao laughed. This was true.He really said.Waving his hand, Li Hao motioned for him to sit down and shut up. He smiled and said,""How much did you gain this time?"In the crowd, Qian Wuliang stood up and said,"Marquis, we killed six level 8 cultivators of the Thunder region!" 16 rank-7s ... It's just that a lot of energy has been extracted, not much is left. ""In addition, kill the life and death emissaries and seize seven Level Seven corpses of the Heaven's Will!""In addition, there are 17 Level Seven Worlds in the heaven seizing formula. Originally, there were more, but a part of them were seized by the neo martial artists!""Life and death messenger ... The Qi of life was given to neo martial, the Qi of death was given to Governor Lin ..."Qian Wuliang reported to them one by one that he had gained a lot.There was also some energy left behind by the Lord of calamity, which Li Hao had taken for himself. He didn't count.At this moment, the pale-faced Queen said weakly,"This time, we've gathered hundreds of billions of humans ...""There are too many humans," she said helplessly."And ... Dean Hong is still trying to recruit more humans. I ... Can't even fit in the divine Kingdom!" Don't come!This time, Hong Yitang didn't do anything else. Everyone was fighting. He participated once in the Thunder region. Later, when he saw that he was no longer needed, he went to the square region to gather the human race.Now, even the Queen of the West could not count how many people there were in the God nation.There were too many!It was so many that ... She was a little desperate.Of course, there was one more thing that Li Hao had yet to reveal. Many of the trillions of humans were cultivating divine text. Li Hao had extracted the Silver Moon cultivator's divine text but did not lend them to the humans. Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  So ... Li Hao had actually had some tricks up his sleeve, but he couldn't expose them all. In this day and age, who didn't have some trump cards?Perhaps the human King did not!The harvest was indeed great!He had gained a lot from the level 7 major worlds, mainly because of the four-sided domain battle. Almost all the experts from the major worlds had run away. It was too late for regrets.Of course, if they didn't run, they might die!"This is a big harvest!"Li Hao nodded and smiled."Then this time ... I'll be selfish for once. Give me all the power of your major worlds. I want to fill 4000 realms!" Even 5,000 realmverses ..."Li Hao sighed with emotion, I know that I'm still lacking in many areas in this battle! I'm probably the weakest among all the heroes in the chaos. The power of 5000 Dao laws ... I'm too embarrassed to say it! This time, the human King had gained a significant increase in his strength. Now, he had at least 7000 Dao laws! When absorbing and devouring new martial arts, it's infinitely close to nine thousand ...""Long Zhan's current strength is already close to 8000. And that huntian ... Chunqiu's strength is not much weaker than huntian's ..."He was still the weakest!He was pitifully weak.5,000 Dao laws ... That was only at the level of the life and death messenger and the light and darkness Messenger. If they worked together, they might even be stronger than him. This time, if it was not for the ten thousand spirits that merged with the Monarchs, he would not have been able to kill the ninth-grade clone.However, such an opportunity did not come by every time. To forge iron, one must be hard!Li Hao had made arrangements for the 4000 and 5000 Dao domains, with chaos heaven's order and spring and autumn's withering as the core. Li Hao had not used their avatars before, so it could be said that they had a full reserve this time!With so many great worlds, it should be enough to destroy almost the entire square domain.The consumption was increasing.No one had any objections.Li Hao continued."Also, give senior twomiao the world origin. With this much, senior twomiao will definitely reach level 8!"Second cat looked up and pretended not to hear.Whatever you say.So what if he was a level eight?He was still an employee!This guy had to fight every day, so annoying."The eighth-grade corpses in the lightning territory ... Must first satisfy the cultivation needs of a few eighth-grade cultivators. If the attributes don't match, you can give them to cultivators who have made great contributions!""Give all the leftovers to the Black Panther. It will devour them!"After saying all that, he turned to look at one of them and said hesitantly,""Satisfy Hu Qingfeng's cultivation needs first. Help him reach the peak of the sixth rank as soon as possible!"

Chapter 3643 An Interesting Soul (3)_6
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùHu Qingfeng was overjoyed!Really?Everyone was speechless, but they could understand. This person ... Had to admit that he was quite bold sometimes. When he impersonated Li Hao in the lightning territory, he had delayed for a while.And his Dao was indeed special."If there are any more, please give priority to Qian Wuliang!" Li Hao continued.Qian Wuliang was stunned."You cultivate the Dao of emotions," Li Hao said."You also cultivate the Dao of reality and illusion. You cultivate all DAOs!"At this point, Li Hao thought of something and said,""A new martial Supreme with thousands of venerable sovereign clones! And that future ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and raised his eyebrows."I can see that one person ... Is ever-changing. Although it's not clear, I can see it ... That person is also very terrifying. He has tens of thousands of DAOs and seems to have countless clones ... I'm not sure if it's correct, but it represents the future. This Dao is not bad and not weak. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to stand beside the future emperor and be extremely close to him!""Qian Wuliang ... You ... You have to work hard in this direction. Cultivate millions of bodies and one venerable sovereign. Sooner or later, you will become the Supreme of Silvermoon!"This was an extremely high evaluation!At this moment, Qian Wuliang was a little scared."Lord Marquis, I'm not worthy to compete with a Supreme neo martial artist ..."He was a ruthless character who called the king's son!Do I dare?If I were Paragon Silvermoon, you ... I wouldn't dare!Li Hao seemed to have guessed something. He raised his eyebrows."What are you thinking? I'm only asking you to learn their Dao, not their foul mouth!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùQian Wuliang felt extremely embarrassed."And ..." Li Hao continued.He looked at the quiet Lin Hongyu in the corner of the crowd and thought for a while.""Hong Yu, you can absorb the Qi of the undead, but you can't absorb too much. It's not a good thing to cultivate blindly. I see that there are cultivators of the undead path around the future ... This means that the future path should be more complete. If I have the time, I'll take you around the river and learn from you."Lin Hongyu nodded slightly and did not say anything.This time, she had absorbed the power of the Deathbringer's great Dao. She hadn't even digested one-tenth of it yet, but she couldn't suppress her death aura any longer. The gap between her and an eighth-level cultivator was too big!However, she didn't say a word and was ready to grind it down."The quality of soldiers is more important than the quantity ... Everyone, cultivate well on your own. Although our rise is slow, don't forget that the number of neo martial artists who have entered level eight is not more than us, and not faster than us. It's the same for long Zhan!""Actually, everyone is at the same starting line, so ... There's no need to think that just because they're old, they're strong!"Li Hao laughed and said,""Finally ... The sky screen system ..."He briefly explained the human King's words and continued,""The heavenly Daoist sect can also expand a little! And now, even the east side of the thousand entrances could not be completely covered. They had to cover the east side first! After that ... We'll expand to the North!"Yes, the North.The five elements of the North!Trash!He was not afraid at all.After going through the Tribulation and beating Tian Fang, he was not afraid of the North five elements Supreme Emperor at all. Even if the five elements emissaries went there, it would be nothing.Of course, it was also Li Hao's idea for the five elements emissaries to go.Suppress the expansion speed of the south and west.He didn't have the heart to fight for hegemony, but ... Neo martial had the heart. He wanted to be an idle person, so he would help neo martial to expand and help himself.This time, he was going to absorb all the power of the macro world by himself.He had to improve himself as soon as possible.A ninth-rank clone had appeared, but was his main body still far away?He hoped that the power of this macro world could help him complete the expansion of his 5000 Dao domains. That way, even if he did not have 9000 Dao laws, he would be infinitely close to 8000.That works too!At the very least, he couldn't be weaker than the human King ...Yes, this is the goal Li Hao set for himself. In order to become stronger, the human King devoured both neo martial worlds and neo martial cultivators ... He must be worried that I'll surpass him by improving so rapidly.One hundred percent!He wasn't so anxious in the past, but now that he's devouring like crazy, I can't fall behind.At the moment, the cultivators on his side don't need to advance much. In that case ... I'll do it myself!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the North. A boom resounded through the heavens and earth. The spring Autumn Emperor's eyes were cold as he laughed. He didn't say anything more and looked at the five elements approaching quickly."The five elements of heaven are here ... It seems like a group of defeated soldiers are about to join forces!"At that moment, Emperor gold Spirit's face turned livid!The Earth Spirit had been killed by Li Hao, and today, Spring Autumn had stopped him and killed the water spirit monarch. Now, there were only three of them left.The power of spring and autumn was beyond imagination.At that moment, he sensed the arrival of tianfang's five elements and his expression changed slightly. The five elements were the foundation Order of Chaos.There were many people who cultivated! Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  However, from ancient times until now, only the tianfang five elements, the former master of the five elements, and the five-element Overlord of the North had a bit of fame.The arrival of these five people seemed to be a pressing matter ...But ...His heart was slightly moved, but he didn't say anything. He looked at the five people who were rushing over, and his eyes flickered. He quickly said,""Five elements emissary...I've long heard of your great name! I am Sky Gold, a metal element cultivator from the North ..."Since they were all cultivators of the five elements, at this moment, they naturally could not call themselves gold spirits. Among cultivators of the five elements, there was still some chance for them to have the same attribute. Spirit represented the peak of the Dao.The five elements messengers looked at the Overlord of spring and autumn with a serious expression.Soon, the metal spirit cultivator in the five rows also said,""I've heard so much about you, my name is jin yang! I'm a stray dog who has lost face for the North this time. I'm too ashamed to stay in the square region, so I've come to seek protection!"At this moment, he had also let go of his pride as a type 9 powerhouse.I'm here to seek protection!Of course ... It would be more appropriate to join forces, because ... This side was quite miserable.There were only three of the five Element overlords left.Not far away, Spring Autumn still looked like a child. He laughed,""Interesting ... You guys are devouring each other, interesting! Since you're all here, I won't continue to tease you. Sky metal ... Next time, I hope you only have five elements and not ten ... It's too boring!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared into the void. Time withered and withered, and no one could catch up with him!Wuxing's expression changed slightly. This person was not weak either!Indeed, he had underestimated these overlords.Of course, the five-element Overlord ... It was really embarrassing to be defeated by a spring and autumn disciple.At this moment, the remaining three five elements overlords 'eyes flickered slightly. They did not say much and quickly introduced each other enthusiastically. They each had their own thoughts and invited the five elements emissaries to the five elements realm as guests.The two sides hit it off. With the change in the chaotic situation, a group of eight people quickly flew towards the five elements realm.At the same time.Behind him, a person appeared. He took a deep breath and cursed!Eight!It was so F * cking difficult to handle.Originally, there were only three left out of five. It was still alright, but suddenly, there were eight ... What a headache.That insensible disciple of mine only knows how to brag, and he bragged to his master, asking his master to kill the five-element Overlord ... Now you've released the five-element emissaries, you really love me!Thinking back to how Spring Autumn had swiftly killed one of them, zhang xuan was slightly taken aback. That fellow ... Was indeed a difficult opponent to deal with.My disciple, don't underestimate this person.He had easily killed one of the four. If he had not been afraid and had not gone all out, perhaps the five Element overlords would have died!Each of these Hundun was more ruthless than the last.He turned his head toward the east ... It seems like silver Moon has gained something this time. I hope I won't fall too far behind here. Thinking about it, he still felt a little regretful. He had actually eaten a lot following his disciple, but now that he's come out, he's only realized that he's been eating from time to time. How miserable.Soon, Yuan Shuo also disappeared.After he disappeared, Spring Autumn suddenly appeared with a smile. He looked to the East ... Li Hao, it seems that you are also going to set foot in the North?If I kill your master ... Will you come to me or take the opportunity to invade the North?How interesting!Forget it, I'll let huntian do this offending job.Spring and autumn disappeared in an instant, like chaos. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared without a trace.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On this day, Hundun went crazy.On this day, the experts were quiet. After the great battle, it was as if they had all disappeared.This day was also the day when the various overlords stepped forward to the front of the stage. In the primal Chaos, rumors of their might had already begun to spread.

3644 Chapter 590
The chaos was extremely quiet.Only the heavenly Daoist Rite began to get lively.More and more cultivators began to know about the heavenly Daoist Rite, about this mysterious place of Dao discussion ... Well, it wasn't mysterious at all, and there were entrances to the heavenly Daoist Rite everywhere.After Li Hao's two attempts, more than 10000 venerable sovereigns had benefited. Now, the dojo's name had long resounded throughout the chaos.Even the venerable sovereigns of the South, North, and West had heard of it. Some powerful venerable sovereigns had even risked billions of Primal Chaos iron ruler to come here just to have a look at the heavenly Daoist sect.In the North, South, East, and West, chaos finally understood who was the true Overlord.The East's new martial, the South's spring and autumn, the West's huntian, and the North's five elements ... Perhaps, new martial should be considered the center. The real East was in the four directions, and here, the chaos race dominated.The Silver Moon King Li Hao had established the heavenly Daoist Rite. In everyone's eyes, he didn't seem like an Overlord, but more like a true preacher. Many venerable sovereigns even called him the Daoist master of the chaos.The master of Dao!Li Hao actually didn't care about such an undeserved reputation.At this moment, he was constructing his own chaos system.4,000 Dao domains. 5000 Dao domains.These 2,000 realms were centered around life and death and order, while the 3000 great DAOs before him were centered around life and death, destruction, revival, and desire.Once he perfected the 5000 realms, he would be able to truly reach the peak of the world, the peak of chaos.At least for now ... The other venerable sovereigns did not have such a big appetite to use the realm as the Dao!One Dao, one realm. In fact, it was not impossible for people like the human King to do it, but the key was ... The consumption was too great.It was unbelievably big!Li Hao had killed too many experts and seized too many worlds, but he had yet to complete the construction of his Dao domain.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the Dao River. The water of the long river flowed continuously, and the power of the great Dao surged out.Within the primal Chaos, there was also a vast amount of Primal Chaos energy surging toward him.Li Hao sat cross-legged and opened up small worlds. At the moment, the small worlds were still illusory. Li Hao's control and perception of the great Dao were extremely profound. The existence of the heavenly Daoist field had given him too many ideas and insights.The world continued to open up.When the time was right, he would make some adjustments to some of the previous great path realms. Every time he made adjustments, it would set off a huge wave.In the river, only er Mao and Dao Qi were watching.Dao chess provided enlightenment of the great Dao. Er Mao's task was to replicate some great DAOs at any time for Li Hao to test and see if he could completely integrate them. With er Mao, Li Hao realized that constructing a Dao domain was much easier.The Dao of duplication was indeed unique. What Dao did one want to use to try to merge them together ... It was not convenient to dismantle the original Dao and let second cat replicate it. It did not matter whether it was strong or weak, so the experiment was naturally completed.Ermao lay on the river and looked on silently.The Li Hao of today was much stronger and more mature than before. With the great Dao surging, he had become more powerful, but ... Level nine had begun to appear in chaos. He didn't know if Li Hao could survive these difficulties.It was actually thinking about something today. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt He wanted to fight.In truth, it was also thinking about whether or not war could see the future. It could see the annoying constant outbreak of war ... The human King said that war was irresponsible and did not want to be tainted, so he gave up on immortality.Actually, second cat heard it.It wanted to say that it wasn't ... But reality seemed to prove that it was true. It had fought because it didn't want to take on this endless trouble, so it had chosen to leave.And all of this, the Tribulation of neo martial, was to be borne by the human King.The tribulations of chaos ... Perhaps ... It was Li Hao who was suffering.Flowing time ...It was a good thing, but also a bad thing.Those level 9s seemed to want to use Li Hao's time to do something. Now, their plan was finally revealed, and they wondered if Li Hao could make it through the suffocating challenge.Also, Primal Chaos splitting the heavens ...This time, if he completed the integration of 5000 Dao domains, Li Hao's combat strength would be raised to the limit. It would be difficult for him to make any further improvements in a short period of time. Without such a great battle, it would be difficult for him to have enough energy to fill up thousands of realms.Then ... Was it necessary to split open the sky?Li Hao had been hoping that the Silver Moon Martial Master could quickly become stronger, but it turned out that time was too short. The only way to overtake him now was to split the sky!When the world was first created, time appeared and thousands of DAOs sprouted ...At this time, if a large number of cultivators entered and participated in the opening of the sky, they would have the chance to overtake and surpass some of the older generation.Hence, second cat wasn't worried about whether Li Hao could complete the construction of the 5000 Dao laws ...No problem!It believed that Li Hao could easily do it, because he was Li Hao.But...Second cat was already worried about what would happen next.Splitting open the sky had to be completed before the arrival of the type 9 realm. Otherwise, it would be difficult to have such an opportunity again. However, if the sky was split open, it would definitely cause a backlash from some people. The experts in the chaos, the experts in the type 9 world, and even the clone of a type 9 Supreme Emperor ... Or even the main body!The true body might be able to descend. At most, the spirituality of the great Dao would be weakened, and its strength would be reduced. However, it would still be a true top-tier level eight, not weaker than huntian.However, the ninth-rank didn't want to die, nor did he want to die with a weak body. That was why he didn't come with his true body.

It wasn't that they couldn't come back, but if they did, they wouldn't have enough spirituality to support their strength. If they died here, it would be a great loss, which was why Tier 9 experts didn't appear.The cat, who had not been involved in other people's business, now felt depressed and had a headache for Li Hao's future.And ...If Li Hao gave up time after the sky was split open, did that mean that he would give up the Dao domain that he had built with great difficulty? would he leave by himself then?Then ... How strong could he be if he relied on his physical body?Seventh-rank?Or level eight?It definitely wouldn't be as powerful as it was now.As for the heavenly Daoist Rite he had built, everything would belong to someone else. Perhaps it would belong to someone in the future, or someone else ... Li Hao, have you made your decision? n(0)velbIn[.]nEt The eunuch was anxious even if the Emperor was not!But in reality, second cat was indeed quite anxious. Sometimes, it did not understand Li Hao's thoughts at all. It did not know what was so bad about inheriting time.Zhan was already dead, and time no longer had an owner.Since you've inherited Shi Guang, no one will fight with you for it. Why ... Must you give it up?Was it for face?In order not to be criticized by others, are you a chess piece?But ... Was this really important?So important that you would give up your unparalleled strength and invincible great Dao for the sake of your face?In the midst of his wild thoughts.Time began to wither and prosper.The long river seemed to have been destroyed.In an instant, it was restored again.Li Hao opened his eyes and fell into deep thought. The Dao of withering, the Dao of destruction, the Dao of revival, the Dao of life and death ...In fact, there were some similarities.Of course, there were also differences.The withering of spring and autumn was very powerful, but even more powerful was that the spring and autumn Imperial Emperor died once a year. After dying, he would resurrect .... Not because of the Dao of life and death, but because of the withering of life .... The price to pay to resurrect from life and death was too great.On the other hand, ku Rong and old mu fengchun were like Imperial Guards. It was less troublesome for them to carry on their father's death.He didn't need to pay too much of a price.This was the difference between life and death.As for Nirvana and resuscitation ... It was still the original existence. Withering and flourishing was in fact a new life. There were some differences."Spring and autumn ... Do you really have 800000 clones?"A year of glory and decline ...If Spring Autumn really had 800000 avatars, from weak to strong ... That would be unbelievable!Also, if each clone had stored enough energy, where would it get the energy?Or could it be that only the body was left behind, but the energy would actually be transferred, just like the Emperor Guard's father ... Or the previous generation of cat palace guards had passed on the energy to the Emperor guard? "According to her, the clone that Spring Autumn gave me is the strongest clone she has. It's probably at the eighth-rank, the kind that has just entered the eighth-rank ... In other words, her other clones might not be as strong as her, and they might just be empty shells?""In that case, can all of my clones, just like the Autarchs and the others, just like my realm...Fuse together?""All of my clones cultivate the Dao of withering and flourishing?"A thought emerged.Now, he had seen long Zhan and huntian in action. He was even more familiar with the human King. He had even seen a ninth-rank one. Only the Supreme Emperor of spring and autumn ... He only had some shallow understanding.Li Hao had never dared to underestimate cold cicada for being able to reach this point."Time Withers ..."Li Hao fell into deep thought.Perhaps, he still did not understand this Dao enough. The past shed skin, avatar, life and death ... Where there was life and death, there would be life ...And now, he had only comprehended a bit of desolation, but he had yet to understand the true essence of glory."Life and death ... Revival ... Destruction ..."Li Hao looked at the core of the 4000th world thoughtfully. After a long time, he had some ideas. Perhaps the key to the Dao of withering was not in withering, but rather in glory. However, the feeling that spring and autumn gave people was that ... The Dao of withering was extremely powerful.The Dao of glory had never been seen before!"Can ... Can you make everything that has withered ... Flourish again?"He suddenly thought of a possibility, and his expression turned grave. Could it be that all of his withered past bodies had suddenly recovered to their peak?That's impossible!If that was the case, 800000 corpses of the past would instantly return to their peak state before they withered ...Oh my God!Li Hao was speechless. It had been at least 100000 years since he reached level 8 in the Spring and Autumn period, and there were at least 100000 level 8 bodies. If they could instantly prosper, wouldn't that mean 100000 level 8 existences?What a joke! No matter how strong a grade-9 was, they wouldn't be able to take it."Impossible ... There must be a limit. First, it's a problem with energy. Second, the power of a great Dao isn't enough to maintain so many clones. Third, it's the same as the Nirvana revival. It can be revived, but it can't be limitless ..."But at this moment, he seemed to think of Spring autumn's trump card.The spring Autumn Thearch was definitely able to restore some of his avatars in an instant. This was the glory of the Dao of life and death!And when she killed her enemies, she would usually instantly age them.Decay and loneliness.Then ... Over the years, did she kill many people and seize their energy and power of the great Dao in preparation for the resurrection of her avatar?Strictly speaking, that was not a clone, but the true body of spring and autumn!Perhaps, it would be even easier to fuse with it than a clone.The more he thought about it, the more speechless he became.If the Dao of life and death was really like that ... It would be quite terrifying.She probably didn't even use her full strength today. This Overlord of the South had been mistaken for the Dao of time, which showed how strong her combat power was. Even huntian might not be able to do anything to her.As for her, she had been maintaining the appearance of a little girl. Was it because she couldn't grow up, or was it ... To deliberately lower People's Guard?

3646 Chapter 590
"The true essence of life and death ... Lies not in death, but in life and death. If it can be combined with the Dao of revival and reincarnation ..." Li Hao fell into deep thought.Now that he had mastered these great DAOs, could he make use of them and merge them together? his thousand realms were still considered independent. Could he take this opportunity to merge them all together?At this point, apart from the time sword, he was still lacking a few killing techniques among the grade 8 ones.He thought ...Li Hao looked at the small realms floating in the air.He also had to cultivate the Dao of order and transform the 5000 Dao laws into an existence of order to establish a true order ...In his heart, he had some vague ideas.He didn't continue to study it. When the path of order was cultivated and the 5000 realms were perfected, he would integrate them. After 5000 realms ... He might not open another realm.Because ... Even if it opened again, it might not be in the river of the path.After going up to the 5000 realms, the consumption was huge. Moreover, he had long thought about not caring about it anymore after opening the pseudo-chaos. Instead, he planned his own Dao and perfected his own orthodoxy.Since that was the case, the future of the path River should not be something he had to worry about.He had to worry about himself!Everything he was doing now was just practice."Everything now is just for practice. I can try anything I want. After all ... Even if it's chaotic, it's a matter for the people in the future ..."Li Hao suddenly smiled at the thought of the future. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt I'm already very kind!The great Dao was constantly tidied up and tested, and it had generally formed a stable system.As for the rest ... What does it have to do with me?Five thousand Dao laws ...Thinking back to the person who walked out of the long river last time, he seemed ... To be around this level?Of course, the other party's Dao was the nomological Dao. Therefore, it was rather powerful, close to the power of 8000 Dao laws!In other words ... Well, it was almost the limit of what he had expected."So ... That's it?"Li Hao laughed, somewhat enlightened.He had chosen 5000 Dao laws to establish the Dao of order and complete the order construction of the Dao River. It was probably not because the people of the future were incompetent, but ... All the Dao laws he had left behind in the pseudo-chaos ... Had reached their limits.Breaking the limit, it's easy to say, but you've never seen or heard of it, using your head to break it?So, if everything went according to his plan, that person had indeed reached his limit!"The establishment of order is the embryonic form of rules. The appearance of Dao spirits requires time to nurture. The key lies in the divine text ..."He didn't need to worry about this.What he should consider more was what he should do?He didn't need to think about it at the moment, but once he succeeded in splitting open the sky, he would be free ... Completely free from time and the current system. He would need a lot of things and preparations. "Also ... There will definitely be a large number of experts who will stop me that day. Even huntian and the others might not support me ..."Countless thoughts appeared in his mind.Very quickly, he suppressed all of this.Perhaps, he still had to make some preparations. When he was fully prepared, he would do this. When the time came, he would be out of the time system. He couldn't be at the mercy of others. Instead, he had to break through and become stronger!"Life and death, Nirvana and recovery, five elements, yin and yang, order, life and death, physical body, time and space ..."These were the current top great DAOs.At present, his 5000 worlds were used by whoever was convenient to him. But in the future, when it came to him, he might have to make some changes and plans. He had to make them in advance and couldn't decide on them at the last minute.And this ... Might require the use of second cat.He looked at second cat ...Second cat was also looking at him and suddenly had a bad feeling.Li Hao looked at the go board again ...Dao chess was Tian Fang's weapon, after all. Otherwise, it would have been a good idea to try it out internally. But at this moment, Li Hao was not too assured. He was not worried about how good Dao chess was, but that the master of Tian Fang would have a way to spy on the truth of Dao chess and find out some of his plans.The world started to fill up one by one.Li Hao made adjustments from time to time. The great worlds he had harvested this time were destroyed and torn apart. The power of great DAOs overflowed and flowed into the river of the path.In the middle of the Dao River, the time stars were slightly dim.Previously, he had used up a lot of time energy.Even now, he had not fully recovered.Li Hao looked at the time that was spinning, and his thoughts had long drifted.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Deep in the chaos great Dao.The countless statues also remained silent.After an unknown period of time, a sculpture suddenly opened its eyes and said,""Three generations of time, you still have no clue? Li Hao is no longer suitable to control time. If you want your great Dao and spirituality to be stable, time is the only thing you can do!""There are tens of thousands of great DAOs, but ... None of us have ever gained enlightenment of time. Tianfang, I have a question. Why ... Why is it that even you are unable to control time? Where is the profound mystery of time?"Be it the combination of great DAOs or nurturing spirituality, everyone was doing it.Why were they unable to nurture time when they reached grade-9?Instead, it was a time cultivator of a generation that raised Shi Guang with the power of a Grade 6. They didn't understand. Could it be that a bunch of Grade 9 cultivators like us couldn't even compare to a Grade 6?What was the core of time?Whether it was combining or cultivating spirituality, who wasn't good at ninth level venerable sovereigns?Why ... Can't we cultivate the Dao of time?Even Tian Fang's wasn't one of them. It was the slightly inferior Dao of space.

Now, the core time Dao couldn't be revealed and the second generation time cultivator wasn't very obedient. He even went against the rules and wanted to go against all the grade 9s. Even Tian Fang couldn't say to wait any longer.Li Hao was going to split open the sky.Second, he wanted to seize the origin of chaos. This was something that everyone knew. That person had not hidden anything at all.Human King, long Zhan, and the others, including huntian and the others, were actually not too worried. These people were all aiming for the ninth-grade, and aiming for the ninth-grade ... That would not destroy the origin of chaos.Neither order nor chaos would be destroyed.But Li Hao ... Would.He didn't seem to be aiming for grade-9, but rather ... No one knew what he was thinking. Why would a few ordinary people make such a big fuss? no one was convinced.After the defeat, Tian Fang, who had been silent the entire time, opened his eyes and frowned slightly.""Three generations. I might know who it is. The Tribulation...I might also know who it is.""What?" the Lord of calamity opened his eyes and said in a deep voice,"I have a guess ... That the person who appeared on Li Hao's river of time might be ... Only a third generation!"But ...He took a deep breath."What I'm worried about now is that the third generation might only appear after Li Hao opens his own small chaos. But the problem is that this will ... Have some unpredictable effects!"Right now, he was also a little hesitant."Tian Fang, could it be that ... We are truly unable to control time?"The third generation had too little knowledge at the moment and was not clear about the details. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Of course, it might not be that person.However, why could only Li Hao control time?Tian Fang was silent for a moment before he replied,"time is the only thing!" It's not that we can't control it, but now, with Li Hao, time has a master. The same time will not be born again. Even if our Dao is the same as his, we can't do it! The Dao of time also had a spirit! Where was this spirit? Unless his spirit is destroyed, it can only be Li Hao!""As for why we haven't been able to figure out time ..." At this point, he thought of the battle back then and said,""Because ... Even if he fought before us, he might not be behind us. Time is too complicated ... It's meaningless to talk about it now. If we want time to disappear from Li Hao's hands, we have to kill Li Hao or the time spirit, or Li Hao will give it up ... Otherwise, it'll be difficult!"They had almost no chance to study another time star.He couldn't do it.Even if the combination method was the same and it was a complete copy, it would not work."Then now ... Are we just going to watch? We ... How long can we wait? We have to get rid of Li Hao as soon as possible. Whether it's US or anyone else, Li Hao is no longer suitable!"The master of tianfang pondered for a while and nodded.""That's right. This time, I contacted Li Hao and tried to persuade him, but it was useless."Therefore, it was imperative to change the candidate!Li Hao was too difficult to control."If we work together to stabilize the chaos, perhaps ... We can let a ninth-rank true body descend ..." The Tribulation said.Everyone looked at him. You?"If it's you, then forget it. At this stage, no one is willing to let others arrive first. Not to mention the control of time, there aren't many spirituality in the chaos. If someone else gets there first and absorbs it all ... At that time, whether they can get out will be a problem.A tribulation might not be reliable."We should be United! "In the current chaos, those cultivators aren't easy to deal with. If we can all descend, we naturally have nothing to fear! However, if we try to hinder each other, in the end, the ones who benefit will be the others!"Speaking of this, the Lord of calamity was a little unhappy.If it weren't for these guys who wanted to kill my Dao spirit that day, why would I be in this state?He would not let Li Hao kill his clone so easily!It would be too difficult to succeed if everyone was trying to hinder each other."If we drag each other down, in the end ... It may lead to an irreparable mistake!" The Lord of calamity said bluntly. If you don't trust me, you can choose a fair, just, and trustworthy cultivator to go to the chaos to kill Li Hao and select a new time cultivator!""To stop Li Hao from splitting open the sky, he must break the Dao of chaos. Once the Dao of chaos is broken ... We will all lose something ..."For example, unlimited energy!Everyone fell into deep thought.Ninth-rank ... Fair and just?Was that even possible?Who would be so kind?At this moment, calamity said,"we can set some restrictions, including some means of checks and balances. Li Hao is not too powerful at the moment. I'm worried that if he grows stronger quickly, it'll be too late!" He had already fused with ten thousand spirits and possessed the power of eight thousand Dao laws. If he continued to improve ... When would he reach nine thousand? Maybe soon ..."Many powerhouses had fought that day, but at this moment, only Li Hao was in discussion.Shi Guang was the existence that they were most concerned about."Chaos!" In the end, the master of Tian Fang said,"if one must descend ... I choose ... Chaos!"Everyone was stunned.Among the statues, a messy statue suddenly opened its eyes.Choose me?Why?He wasn't too powerful and didn't have much say among the grade-9 Masters. Therefore, he didn't say much and didn't fight for anything.What's the point of choosing me?Tian Fang said,"the current chaos is not chaotic enough!" Huntian's group still had some restraints and had yet to cross swords with each other. Even if a ninth-rank true body really did descend ... How much strength could it exert if its spirituality was insufficient? Once the rank 9s descend, these people will join forces again!"

3648 Chapter 590
"Only ... Let chaos descend into chaos first, causing a large number of powerhouses to fall and become enemies with each other. We might even split up new martial and silver Moon to create cracks ... These are the key to solving the problem."Tian Fang said softly,"if chaos descends, no one will be able to suppress it. It will definitely cause the entire chaos great Dao to fall into chaos. Order will collapse! This is the key to stopping chaos heaven from establishing order. ""Secondly, we have to disrupt the Dao of chaos so that they can't sort it out and slow down their progress.""Thirdly, the current chaos. Several experts have walked the path of convergence of 10000 DAOs. There are many great DAOs, but they have yet to be successfully integrated. This is the best time for chaos to take effect. The chaos will shake and become chaotic. The spirituality of the chaos Dao will also be strengthened ... This way, we can avoid a lot of trouble!" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt As soon as he said that, everyone looked at the statue that wasn't too strong.The chaos path master!In the past, it was an existence that had created chaos. However, there were too many experts back then. After creating some chaos, this person was quickly suppressed by a type 9 expert. Later on, he became obedient. Although he had also entered type 9, it was very difficult for him to advance any further.Today, the power of Dao laws wasn't too strong. It only had a little more than 9000 great Dao.Among Grade 9, it was considered an existence at the bottom.Choosing this person ... Was not a bad choice.It was better than a tribulation!Calamity was quite ambitious, and chaos path master had another flaw. Chaos and order were always opposing each other, and chaos itself needed chaos to have order ... It was very contradictory!This also caused him to hesitate after he reached grade-9. Whether to establish order or chaos, both sides had some conflict.Therefore, there was almost no improvement in these years.At this moment, the chaos path master slowly said,""Me? I don't think it's appropriate ... Let's not talk about whether I have the ability to suppress them. Even if I do ... It's very dangerous, and I might not be able to gain anything ..."He didn't really want to go. Although the others wanted to come, he ... Had been really depressed recently.If I go and create chaos, then you guys will suppress it for me ... Wouldn't that be a waste of effort?At this moment, Tian Fang spoke,"your Dao of chaos has not made any progress all these years. I suspect that it might be related to the fact that order has not completely collapsed yet! Establishing order in chaos may be a feasible path for you. Now, chaos heaven may be related to order. I think you should go and take a look ..."p The path master of the path of chaos was stunned for a moment, and he fell into deep thought.All these years, what has been bothering me, is there still order?The others were also thinking whether it was appropriate for this fellow to go.It seemed like ... There was nothing more suitable than this.After a long while, the chaos path master spoke."Then, it's not that I can't descend. However, chaos might not be safe, even if I'm a tier 9!" At the current stage, a level 9 doesn't have enough spirituality and might not be able to crush a level 8, especially huntian and the other cultivators ...""So, if you want me to descend, that's fine, but I have a request!" Everyone cursed in their hearts. You still have a request?No one could have thought of this opportunity!At the current stage, the chaotic spirituality was still insufficient. It was at its limit to maintain the arrival of one or two rank-9s. The key was that the others could not leave even if they wanted to.Tian Fang didn't seem to mind. He smiled and said,""What are your thoughts?""All of your men must be under my command! "Whether you're people left in the chaos or people who have descended through other means, you have to listen to my orders. I don't want things to turn out like this ... The people from the calamity and the people from Tian Fang have descended, but they split up and fought against each other, giving them an opportunity to take advantage of us!""Infighting ... Will only result in greater losses."Chaos seemed to be a little calm. Although he cultivated the chaos Dao, it didn't mean that he was chaotic to begin with. His thinking was very normal."Now, the chaos is divided. I need enough people to create chaos, strengthen myself, and resist all sides. In the end ... I can create even greater chaos! As for the time cultivator Li Hao ..."He paused for a moment before continuing,"before we find a suitable successor, we must kill him. Once time vanishes, it will be the greatest danger. Thus, before we have full confidence and before a successor appears, I don't recommend killing him ... We can even pay a price for this and let him open the sky. At least, we can be sure that three generations of time can walk out of the fake chaos he opened ..."When he said this, Tian Fang nodded.""You're right. Although everyone thinks that Li Hao is no longer suitable to control time, it doesn't mean that ... We can kill him at will. If we kill him, time will be completely destroyed, and no one will be able to inherit it. Everyone, all these years of waiting ... Will be in vain!"The Lord of calamity frowned, but after thinking about it, he nodded.That was true!Although he felt that it might work, what if ... It really didn't work?Wouldn't that be troublesome?He had waited for a million years!If no one could cultivate time, then it would be terrible."Three generations of people walked out of Li Hao's world of creation. They're actually a problem only second to Li Hao 's, but if the problem isn't as great as Li Hao's ... Then this is the only choice!""After all, I don't have much knowledge ...""That's right. He's like a cultivator from a small world. He doesn't have much knowledge and should be easier to control than Li Hao.""You're right!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe group of venerable sovereigns discussed with each other and agreed with chaos 'suggestion.

3649 Chapter 590
As for the chaos path master, he pondered for a while and didn't say anything else.If he could agree to all these, it was not impossible for him to make a trip.Perhaps, this was also a chance.All this time, he had been suppressed by the other tier 9 powerhouses. This time, if he was the only one to descend ... This might be his chance to turn the tables.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The grade-9 experts were also preparing to descend upon the primordial chaos once more.At this moment, Li Hao began to perfect the five-thousandth world. The four-thousandth world was filled up.However, it consumed a lot of energy.The five-thousandth world ... Might not be enough.He had seized many worlds this time, but Li Hao also discovered that it would be more difficult to fill them up as he advanced. The consumption would be greater. It was already so difficult to conquer 5000 worlds, so it would be even more difficult to become stronger and more worlds.No wonder everyone was unwilling to take this path and use the world as their Dao.The consumption was too terrifying!Almost all the macro worlds in the Eastern Region had been killed. That was all. If it were someone else, they would not have been able to hold on.4,500 Jie!At this moment, Li Hao's stored energy was almost completely consumed, even less than he had expected.p Only when he reached the 5000 realms would he have enough power to do something.In less than 5000 worlds, which was about 4500 worlds, his strength was about 7000 Dao laws. He should not be as strong as the others.Li Hao made a judgment and calculated for a while."How about seven or eight more Level-7 worlds or two or three Level-8 worlds ... Otherwise, it won't be enough."In the past, it would have been easy for a macro world to fill up 100 worlds with 500 boundaries. However, it was impossible now. He might have to expect more.  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  Or perhaps ... He could get a level nine world from somewhere!This was good enough.For example, tianfang world. Unfortunately, it had been completely consumed by neo martial.In the chaos, the only ninth-order world that existed on the surface was tianfang. The other worlds, including the realm of calamity, only had those lightning pillars. They might have been directly emptied by the Lord of calamity years ago, leaving only this."Or perhaps, I can devour the worlds of the overlords?"That should be enough!The worlds of the overlords might not be weaker than the current type 9 worlds. After all, the type 9 worlds had no master and had been silent for years. They might not be stronger than their worlds.Spring and autumn?Huntian?Or the five elements?As for letting his teacher deal with the five elements ... That was just to make his teacher proud. His teacher had taken it seriously, but Li Hao did not. If he really hoped that Yuan Shuo, who was at the seventh step, could kill the five elements Overlord ... That would be a joke.His teacher was talented, but that didn't mean that he could do it.Sending his teacher to the North was just a prelude.Sending the five elements emissaries over ... Was also to prevent the five elements from being destroyed by others. In fact, Li Hao had long regarded the five elements as his own."The five birds technique is what I'm best at and the core ... I'll use the power of the five elements to construct my final ring ..."As he thought about this, Li Hao opened his eyes and stopped his seclusion.With a wave of his hand, a person appeared.It was silent!Hu Qingfeng was a little confused ...Just as he was about to speak, Li Hao sent him a voice transmission, you, stay here and summon ... Anyway, let ... Let that thing appear here and continue to pretend to be in seclusion! Don't say anything to anyone. It's not that I don't trust you, but there are too many people watching me now!"Hu Qingfeng understood!He hurriedly smiled and said nothing, but his attitude was clear. "Lord Marquis, please be at ease. I have no problems."Seeing this smiling face ... Li Hao felt helpless. "Don't expose the fact that I'm leaving. I'm going out for a while to do something ..."Speaking of this, he suddenly laughed."If someone comes to look for you, send someone to neo martial to find the human King for help.""Yes, yes!"Hu Qingfeng nodded hurriedly.Li Hao didn't bring anyone with him this time. He was going to the North alone.This time ... They had to eradicate the North!His strength was around 7000 Dao laws, so it should be about right. Furthermore, he would not do it openly this time.In the North, huntian and Chunqiu were probably plotting something."As for my teacher, he's at the seventh step. He's probably been discovered there, and he probably feels that ... He's the core. This time, I'll let him take the blame and be a target!"Everyone thinks I'm going to open the sky in the East ..."Li Hao smiled. Why in the East?The chaos was vast, but where was it different?He would go to the North, or the West if he couldn't ... Opening it in chaos heaven's lair wasn't a bad idea. Chaos heaven's lair was orderly, so it was more suitable.He would have to catch them off guard!"Secondly, I need to accumulate some energy for my own cultivation. I can't prepare these things in the open, or I'll reveal all my trump cards."Chaos ... It's better to be a little more chaotic. It's better to get chestnuts from the fire!"Thinking about this, he thought about his trip this time. Perhaps ... He should put on a disguise.Impersonating ... A ninth-rank clone?That's right. At this moment, Li Hao had such a thought. Perhaps he was a powerhouse from a level 9 world.Anyway, they couldn't refute it even if they were the scapegoat."I know the Dao of tribulation. Everyone knows that ... I also know the Dao of the five elements ..."I have to pretend to be a great Dao that no one knows about, a great Dao that I know!"Time, life and death, Nirvana and recovery, life and death, order, desire ..."These DAOs could not be used.Not even yin and yang!What other great Dao is there that is so powerful that no one knows that I know it?He knew a lot of great DAOs, but there were not many powerful great DAOs. Most of the great DAOs 'power could only be cultivated slightly.More importantly, I don't want anyone to suspect me.Also ... It had to be the core great Dao that some rank-nine Dao Masters had mastered a million years ago.Li Hao had an idea."Chaos!"He chuckled. He knew how to cultivate chaos, and there were people cultivating it as well. On Silver moon's side, there were people cultivating it-not people, but trees. The Redwood tree had always been cultivating. In truth, the Dao of chaos was relatively easy, but it was difficult to improve.Chaos was chosen because of ... Order!It was the opposite of order!At that time, huntian probably wouldn't think too much about invading the huntian domain, and chaos ... Creating chaos was the goal. If that was the case, it would also be logical."En, impersonating the chaos path master ..."And now, he had some understanding of some of the people from a million years ago. This person was not famous and it was said that his strength was ordinary. Perhaps, he was the most suitable.After thinking this through, Li Hao instantly disappeared and turned into a breeze.He had disappeared from the Eastern Region!On this trip, I really had to keep a low profile for a while. On the surface, I was still a good person who maintained order in chaos, so I couldn't ruin my reputation.[PS: this is the last day. Please give me some monthly votes!] In addition ... May would probably be the end of the month.
