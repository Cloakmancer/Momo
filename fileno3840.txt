"I see ..."She murmured,"maybe my path is wrong."It's not about having a strong body of one's race that one can live a long life, but rather ... Gain wisdom!She had always wanted to steal the spirit and the source, to shape the body of the spring Autumn Cicada, to make the spring Autumn Cicada's life force rich, to let the spring Autumn Cicada live for countless years, to make the spring Autumn Cicada full of spirituality.However, this was a bid, not a capital.The essence was wisdom!She shouldn't have been pursuing this all these years. Instead, she should have ... Intelligence. Only with intelligence could she have a spirit.Spring Autumn fell into deep thought. At this moment, her countless harmonious spirit clones were rapidly growing stronger. She could feel the spirituality within them. She looked at Li Hao in the distance. Li Hao, let the spirit of ten thousand emperors fuse into my body.So ... From the beginning, he had understood!Intelligence was the key to increasing one's spirit and breaking the race's limit!At this moment, Chunqiu couldn't hold it in any longer. He shouted with a sharp voice,""Li Hao, our clan's lifespans are short, and we lack wisdom. How can we open our wisdom?" She had lived for many years!Li Hao was very young.But at this moment, she was asking Li Hao.Our clan's lifespan is short, and it's only a few months. How can we make them gain wisdom in such a short time?This wasn't a simple question of life force. Awakening one's intelligence might be even more difficult than seizing one's source.Her aura was getting stronger and stronger.At this moment, Li Hao's voice came.""Wisdom lies in civilization! There is no civilization in the spring and autumn era. Civilization is in words, culture, education, system, politics, and ... Faith!""Faith is not in God!"Li Hao's sword struck out and annihilated the lightning in the world. His attack was simple and his voice was still steady."Short lifespans in spring and autumn, limited vision, no civilization, no system, born mentally disabled ..."The spring Autumn Emperor glared at him!Retarded?This was an insult!You're the idiot.Alright, in the next moment, she was dejected. Perhaps.To the human race, demons and beasts of primordial chaos were also retards. Perhaps, in their eyes, only humans were not retards.She wanted to be angry, but she couldn 't.Li Hao's voice came again."Today, you have thousands of clones with strong bodies and spiritual feet. In this battle, if you can preserve a large number of clones and nurture them to enlighten them, this is the fire seed!""You cut off your own connection and created a race with your clones. You created a race with each demon, regardless of the price and consequences. You perfected the civilization, the system, and the culture ... Sooner or later, the spring Autumn Cicada will be able to rise in the chaos!" Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Spring Autumn was in a daze!What?"Using my clone as a spark to spread civilization?This ...She couldn't help but say,"the clones are me. They are all me. I am the race. Isn't this the same as that pervert from the myriad world?"“……”Over at the myriad world, the cultivators of the Dao integration new heaven all looked at the little girl in the new heaven. Looking at spring and autumn ... She was also a little girl.They were all thinking,'are you all ... Destined to become perverts?'Was Li Hao also a pervert?Allowing the spring and autumn clone to evolve into a race?Wasn't this The Birth of a Race between him and himself?"What's not good about it?"LAN Tian laughed.Li Hao's voice rose again."No. In spring and autumn, the clone is not you. It has withered and withered over time, no memories, no spirituality, no bloodline. A tree, when its seeds are scattered, is a forest!""Even a human needs ten months of pregnancy. When the melon is ripe, the stem will fall. It originates from the mother's body. Your spring and autumn clan, if we trace it back to the past, might only have been created by two or one spring and autumn Cicada!""Li Hao!"At this moment, the power of the calamity suddenly erupted. The Lord of calamity was furious.You still dare to be so arrogant when you're fighting me?Savage!Li Hao waved his sword and roared like a tiger. As if the will of heaven had descended, he berated,""It's none of your business, shut up!"“……”The Tribulation was furious!This is too much!"You're underestimating me too much!" He roared, and the power of countless calamities gathered again. At this moment, the power of fate instantly appeared. He looked at Li Hao, and in an instant, it was as if dark clouds had gathered over his head!In his eyes, there was only endless darkness!His expression changed, but in the next moment, he was overjoyed. This was ... A dead end!He seemed to have seen Li Hao's fate of endless darkness and eternal hell. At this moment, his confidence soared!Previously, he had felt helpless and despaired when he saw the sky and fate as boundless as a golden pillar between heaven and earth. However, Li Hao's future was like a dark abyss.This also meant that Li Hao's future ... Would only be a dead end!This person must die!In an instant, heaven and earth were reversed. Suddenly, it was as if the power and the great Dao were one. Despair and catastrophe instantly turned into a force that reversed heaven and earth!Countless great DAOs surged toward Li Hao.Li Hao smiled. Suddenly, the long sword disappeared, as if it had turned into a giant dragon. It opened its mouth and swallowed, and the power of the great Dao dissipated.Before he could recover from the Tribulation, the giant dragon suddenly disappeared and turned into a door!That gate was dazzling with Starlight!In an instant, the door opened as if it led to an endless abyss. Li Hao's laughter echoed."Tribulation, please enter my heart and observe my power!"In an instant!Countless despairing forces, countless people's shouts, countless people's roars, a monstrous will burst out!"No disaster!"It was the sound of millions and millions of living beings shouting. This door seemed to lead to everyone's heart. What were they longing for?"We ... Long for the disaster to disappear!Li Hao, who had been filled with despair, suddenly burst out with a brilliant holy light behind his heart. With a loud boom, the power of tribulation retreated like black water!

It was unbelievable!"What is this?""Heart gate!"Li Hao laughed, the door in my heart! The door at the bottom of his heart! There are countless living beings in the chaos who don't like you. Those who gain the Dao will receive more help, while those who lose the Dao will receive little help! The person who brings disaster is destined to be unpopular. Despair is on the surface, but the heart is on the inside!"The Tribulation was shocking!This gate was actually devouring and dissolving his power of calamity.However, he quickly recovered and suddenly sneered,""The primordial chaos is filled with tribulations and difficulties! Today, the catastrophe has descended. Li Hao, you're destined to be unable to wear me out!""Is that so?"Suddenly, it was as if time had reversed!The Lord of calamity's expression changed drastically. At this moment, Li Hao disappeared, and the power of time seemed to cover the calamity."Time didn't explode?" the Lord of calamity shouted angrily."It exploded! What exploded was the time of war, and I didn't use time ..."Li Hao's voice rang in his ears again.""Tribulation and time are both DAOs and not DAOs! Time is only nature, nature of all things, nature of all DAOs ...""You're too noisy!"The Tribulation roared, and the power of the Tribulation rose again!I don't need you to preach to me!I'm not interested in what you're saying. He only knows that Li Hao is very difficult to deal with and troublesome at the moment. The extremely young Li Hao is like a million-year-old demon.He had many tricks up his sleeve!The power of despair, the power of the heart gate, and the power of time were all causing him to be defeated!How could this be?He had recovered to the peak of his past and had even surpassed it. The him now, even if it was a million years ago, was still a peerless expert. Perhaps, he was only slightly weaker than Tian Fang.But Li Hao was so young. How could he be so powerful?Was Li Hao at the ninth-rank or not?A path with spirit was a ninth-level path. It might be so, but Li Hao's Dao law seemed to be different from others. They couldn't even judge whether he was a ninth-level powerhouse or not.At this time, Li Hao suddenly appeared!The Tribulation was shocking!Li Hao's voice had been drifting in the air. He thought that Li Hao had used a Dao technique similar to spatial techniques.But at this moment ... Li Hao seemed to appear in his mind!He was in disbelief!That was impossible!I'm a powerhouse of the ninth step. It's impossible for Li Hao to break through my defense and enter the depths of my heart. This is impossible!Not far away.Paragon sky square also looked at it, deep in thought.At this moment, a person seemed to have appeared in his heart. It was Li Hao. It was as if a door had been pushed open and directly entered the depths of his heart. At this moment, the venerable sovereign was a little panicked! He wasn't afraid of the other party's strength, but this extremely strange method made him instantly apprehensive!"Impossible!"With a fierce roar, his heart beat so violently that it was on the verge of exploding. For an expert like him, even if his heart exploded, it wouldn't be a big deal. At this moment, he felt Li Hao enter his heart.In an instant, his heart seemed to have turned into a battlefield.BOOM!With a loud bang, the door collapsed, and Li Hao disappeared. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The Tribulation coughed up blood!Suddenly, his vision blurred, and a white light flashed. He raised his head and saw that Li Hao not far away seemed to have never moved. He seemed to have been in the same place all along, but he also seemed to have just returned!At this moment, Li Hao was still holding his longsword. He smiled."You already said that the Tribulation was an illusion. Why did you ... Self-destruct your heart?"The Tribulation changed color!This was impossible. Was it really an illusion?I'm a ninth-rank, how could he make me hallucinate?At this moment, not far away, Tian Fang suddenly spoke,""Tribulations, the ghosts in the heart, too many! You should focus on fighting and be overly suspicious. At your level, you should throw away everything and focus on nothing else. Why should you be disturbed?"The Tribulation shook!The ghost in his heart!Li Hao turned his head and chuckled."Tian Fang, if this were Silver Moon, you would have been beaten to death a million times over for interrupting someone's fight!" Even if I, the Silver Moon Martial Master, and my disciple were to die in battle, as a master, I won't say a word! You're such a boring person. You're one with your mouth, one with your heart, and one with your brain. If you want to see my bottom line, you might as well just attack me directly! Why let tribulation test you? whether you're a hypocrite or a real villain, you should at least have one. You're the most disgusting!"Tian Fang chuckled."I was being too talkative. I just wanted to see ... A more exciting battle. Tribulation was too distracted and was scared by you. This kind of battle is not fair."Li Hao also laughed, is this your so-called fairness? If I'm only good at illusions, then all the illusions are unfair? Tianfang, be a human and don't have double standards ..."As soon as he finished speaking, the sword intent appeared again!The Lord of calamity dodged in an instant. It was a little angry that it had been played by Li Hao. Previously, when Li Hao's heart gate had appeared and directly dissolved the power of its calamity, it had become greatly wary.Therefore, he really thought that Li Hao had used some tricks to get into his heart.He was indeed afraid of time and heart gate, but all of this was just an atmosphere of battle created by Li Hao.This guy had been calculating all along!Damn it! Bastard!……And at this moment.In the distance."Die!" The human King bellowed as his saber descended. The power of darkness appeared as yin and yang combined. In an instant, a loud sound rang out as a type 9 divine Emperor was sliced into two!At the same time, the catastrophe seemed to become even more turbulent.BOOM!Li Hao was suddenly sent flying, but the Lord of calamity smiled at the human King in the distance.

The human King turned his head and looked over. He shrugged his shoulders and laughed as well."Senior human King ... Do you not like me?" Li Hao chuckled.The human King laughed,"I'm not unhappy ... I'm very unhappy!" "Of course, don't mind it. I'm just killing a person. A calamity relies on chaos and chaos. The greater the disaster, the stronger it will be! We can't just sit back and let them hit us, right?"He had killed a rank-9, but the calamity had become even stronger!This was the path of tribulation!"If you don't kill him, there might be problems if the battle goes on for a long time. But if you kill him, the calamity will shake, and the Dao of calamity will become stronger.This was also the reason why the Tribulation didn't care about the life and death of those Grade 9 experts.His strength had actually been increasing all this while!At this moment, the human King had combined yin and yang.He seemed to have been waiting, waiting ... For someone to be able to suppress the Tribulation before he chose to combine yin and yang.Li Hao didn't say anything else.He attacked again!The Lord of calamity laughed. At this moment, instead of taking the initiative to fight, he avoided Li Hao. He was also waiting for those people to kill more experts, no matter who was Dead or Alive.To him, the more people who died, the stronger he was!……At this moment, the human King wasn't the only one showing his might.There were only nine level 9s to begin with, and Li Hao had killed one of them the moment he appeared. Now, with the human King killing another, there were only seven level 9s left.Spring and autumn's myriad Dao body and myriad world body were completely fused together.Even silver moon's River had been integrated into her.Spring and autumn felt a boundless power!Its spirituality was crazily emerging.At that moment, the desire of the other venerable sovereigns appeared in his mind. It was as if they wanted to solve the problem together. That desire, that impatience ...Even Spring Autumn was immersed in it.Was this ... The power of all living beings?That's right. At this moment, she seemed to have sensed something different. She could sense why the human King and the others were able to improve so quickly. The few of them were all fusing the power of all living beings.Including Li Hao!In an instant, spring and autumn disappeared. In an instant, heaven and earth seemed to have withered. The boundless chaos seemed to have completely withered at this moment. Life had withered.The grade-9 expert who was fighting with Yuan Shuo suddenly sighed.He knew that spring and autumn was targeting him.Spring and autumn was not weak to begin with, and at this moment, he had fused with ten thousand emperors. There were probably tens of thousands of venerable sovereign spirits. At this moment, spring and autumn had returned to his peak state and was much stronger than before.He and Yuan Shuo were only slightly better.How could he be a match for spring and autumn!"This chaotic world ... Is really ... Eye-opening!"The rank nine laughed and looked at Yuan Shuo. At this moment, Yuan Shuo had also sensed some danger. In an instant, a monstrous power emerged from his body, and an extremely thick great Dao law appeared between heaven and earth. The chaos great Dao emerged.The ninth-rank cultivator smiled coldly."Let's make it more chaotic. There's no construction without destruction. Just make it more chaotic!"In an instant, it shot straight for the chaos great Dao!It was not for Yuan Shuo. Yuan Shuo was shocked. This was ...At the same time, several grade-9 cultivators suddenly gave up on their opponents and headed straight for the chaos great Dao, their spirituality exploding to the extreme.In the distance.Supreme Emperor Tian Fang frowned slightly. In an instant, he appeared outside the chaos great Dao. The few rank nines sneered."It seems like you didn't fall into my trap ..."Tian Fang was silent.The level nine experts 'spirituality exploded, and the power of their great DAOs shook. Suddenly, the entire chaos great Dao shook violently. At that moment, the master of the square sky made his move!A powerful spatial force appeared and instantly transformed into a huge shield!A few grade nine experts wanted to charge into the chaos great Dao but were instantly stopped.Tian Fang frowned."I didn't want to kill you!"These people actually wanted to destroy the origin of chaos at this moment and rush straight for the chaos great Dao. Clearly, they all knew that the situation was over. In that case, it was better for everyone to fall into chaos.This was not the result Tian Fang wanted."I didn't want to kill ..."As soon as he finished speaking, countless spatial forces appeared and instantly tore them apart.At the same time, several heavenly squares appeared in front of the rank nine venerable sovereigns. They said with emotion,""It's been a million years ..."A white light flashed!The human King and the others 'vision blurred, and they could not see anything else.The spring Autumn Thearch had just gotten stronger and wanted to kill a rank nine to prove herself. However, her opponent was gone in a flash. She was a little stunned. Then, she looked into the distance and heard a loud bang! The tier 9 expert who had dealt with Yuan Shuo earlier had actually ... Been destroyed by Tian Fang in just a short while! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Spring autumn's expression changed, and he could not help but curse!I just became strong!This guy, this bastard!At this moment, she only felt that she had no place to use her strength. The next moment, she suddenly charged toward Tian Fang. Tian Fang glanced at her, shook his head, chuckled, and punched out!The entire primordial chaos seemed to have shattered.He had been waiting for Li Hao, not for spring and autumn. Had he become arrogant?Did she think that she would be able to match him just because she absorbed the power of ten thousand emperors?The space exploded!The chirping of cicadas resounded, and the space seemed to freeze. As time passed, the crack in space disappeared. Chunqiu said provocatively,""It's nothing more than this!"In an instant, a sharp scream suddenly rang out!The entire space exploded in all directions. Tian Fang looked at her and smiled,""Is it only so?"

Some of the spring and autumn avatars were instantly destroyed, and their expressions changed drastically!Li Hao couldn't help but have a splitting headache."Why did you provoke him?"If he wanted to kill, he could kill, not you. Yet, you went to provoke Tian Fang. Seriously ... Was Spring autumn's IQ too low?Not far away.Many of Spring autumn's avatars had been torn apart by the space, but he was still smiling.Do you all think I'm stupid? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Suddenly, the space around them seemed to freeze. Spring and autumn disappeared and reappeared on the side of the chaos great Dao. Tian Fang was about to attack when spring and autumn disappeared again!When she reappeared, she was already in her original form. In an instant, she madly absorbed the power of countless great DAOs.The next moment ... He turned around and ran!Tian Fang was stunned. He looked at her and suddenly laughed."Your standards ... Are too low!"He thought that Chunqiu really wanted to compete with him.In the end, Spring Autumn had only devoured the power of a rank nine great Dao that he had killed.His vision was too low!Chunqiu was also extremely pleased with herself as she disappeared from her spot. The person she had just devoured was Yuan Shuo's opponent. She had been prepared to kill him, but Tian Fang had snatched it away. Now, she had gotten it back! After losing a few avatars, what he got back was the power of a Grade 9 great Dao!It was worth it!"Is your vision too low?"Spring Autumn immediately ran back and transformed into a little girl. At this moment, she was also very arrogant,""Your horizons are quite broad. Your horizons are broad, but I've never seen you suppress the primordial chaos, nor have I seen you pacify the primordial chaos in a million years! Your tianfang world has been destroyed, and your vision is so high. Aren't you still waiting for a change to appear? who are you waiting for? Are you waiting for Li Hao or for Su Yu and the others?""That makes sense." Tian Fang was stunned and smiled again.Spring Autumn ignored him.It's fine as long as I've profited!At this moment, Tian Fang made his move again. This time, he was no longer targeting Spring Autumn, but the other tier 9 experts. Instantly, he covered the entire area. At this moment, the human King and Su Yu also made their moves!A few grade-9 experts escaped and were stopped by Tian Fang. They didn't have many opponents left.At this point ... These level 9s were almost all destined to be exterminated.At this moment, there were two more grade-9 experts in front of them. One of them had escaped to Tian Fang's side, while the other two exchanged glances and suddenly disappeared!It seemed to have hidden into the void!Li Hao, who was formed by er Mao and Hu Qingfeng using Li Hao's flesh and blood, was about to stop them when he suddenly stopped.Spring Autumn was shocked!The two of them ran straight towards her. She cursed in her heart. It's me again. Am I easy to bully?I'm not the same person as before!Just as they were about to flip out, they were stunned and stopped. The two Grade 9 experts appeared and looked at each other before nodding.In an instant, a destructive power appeared, along with countless spirits. However, they were all shattered in the blink of an eye and fused into spring autumn's body. He wanted to retreat, but he didn't sense any danger.She thought that it would end up the same as huntian, the two of them wanted to possess her!However, the two rank nines only fused their broken spirituality and the power of their great DAOs into her body. Before Chunqiu could make a move, the two of them suddenly roared, and a chaos great Dao floated above their heads!Although it was not a complete chaos great Dao, it was still a projection of the chaos great Dao.The two of them didn't even think. In an instant, the great path shook violently. With a boom, the great path shattered. One of the two shouted,""Stop playing, life!"As soon as he said that, Chun Qiu was still hesitating.All of a sudden, a female venerable sovereign from Emperor Yu's side, who was also a rare ninth rank venerable sovereign, smiled. In an instant, a majestic life force emerged from her body!Spring and autumn was stunned again. A majestic life force gushed into her body, while monarch life instantly turned into a huge tree, swaying in the wind.The two ninth rank venerable sovereigns also revealed their true forms!One of them was a giant kun Peng, while the other turned into a Wolf-like creature. The wolf looked at Chun Qiu coldly and sneered,""You're lucky, demon race ... At this point, I don't think there's any way out!"Spring Autumn was shocked!She didn't look at the giant wolf, but at the kun Peng. The kun Peng looked very familiar!The gigantic kun Peng's body was crumbling. When he saw Chunqiu looking at him, he laughed,""Many years ago, I encountered a talented cicada. It was a rare sight, but I didn't expect it to be able to reach this point. It's incredible ... My demon race has only produced three level 9s, including their lives!""The humans are strong while the demons are weak, but at least they are slightly stronger than the primordial chaos. Of course, there isn't much of a difference between the primordial chaos and the demons. They are both weak!" The kun Peng's body shattered and he groaned,""Since we're fighting to rule the world today, why don't you try ...""Venerable sovereign!" He roared,"are there any more venerable sovereigns in the chaos demon race?" Since the opportunity was right, harmonious spirit spring and autumn! If humans can fight, we demons must fight for a future!"In an instant, demon blood exploded!Spring Autumn felt a little dazed!The demon race ...The demon clan had given birth to three ninth rank venerable sovereigns, but at this moment, they had chosen to fuse their power with her.Me?I just ...Just as she was thinking about it, the giant wolf also exploded instantly. A wave of fluctuation reverberated in Chun Qiu's ears."Fate sees the future. Of course, the future may not be accurate, but in the future, the demon race will still stand at the peak of chaos! Spring and autumn, in the future, you will occupy a place ..."Before he could finish his words, the spirit completely disappeared!At this moment, Emperor Yu did not make any more moves to kill the path Master of Life, who was on the verge of collapsing. The path Master of Life's body swayed as he glanced at Spring Autumn, then at Li Hao in the distance.Without saying anything, a large amount of life force was instantly dispersed and spread in all directions.An incomparably dense life force instantly covered everyone.By now, Tian Fang had already killed all of the others. It was only now that he had the time to look back. He saw the three demon race venerable sovereigns, who had chosen to merge with the Dao of spring and autumn. He laughed."As expected ... All living beings want to fight!"He shook his head slightly.At this point, the three of them knew that they were going to die. Even if spring and autumn might not be their only hope, they didn't care. They might as well take advantage of spring and autumn instead of others!After all, she was still a demon.In the blink of an eye, almost all the level nine venerable sovereigns had died.The aura of the catastrophe over there was getting stronger and stronger. Although these people did not fuse their DAOs with him, a large number of level nine cultivators had died, and the power of their great DAOs was getting stronger and stronger.He also smiled!He looked at Li Hao, who was not far away, and smiled."Li Hao, you seem to have miscalculated!"In addition to the ninth-grade great Dao that had been snatched away, Spring Autumn had devoured four ninth-grade great Dao powers. With the addition of harmonious spirit ten thousand emperors, Spring autumn's aura was soaring!This demon, who was originally unremarkable on this battlefield, had instantly become one of the top powerhouses.Tribulation laughed!Li Hao, is this the result you wanted to see?"You came out early, so you weren't able to reach the peak yourself. Instead, you allowed Spring Autumn to take advantage of you and reach this point.Li Hao looked back at Spring Autumn. At this moment, the power of desolation in Spring autumn's body was rising crazily. A special wave spread out, as if he had officially entered the ninth-rank!Spring Autumn was also at a loss!She knew that the demon race had nine levels, but ... The demon race and the human race were different. They were actually very divided.She had never expected these top venerable sovereigns of the demon race to pass on their great DAOs to her.In the end ... At the last moment, these few people actually chose her!At this moment, when she looked at Li Hao and calamity again, she suddenly felt that ... She might not be as good as Tian Fang, but ... She wasn't much worse than the two of them!"Congratulations!" Li Hao laughed.Spring Autumn had gained a huge advantage in this battle.When Spring Autumn heard this, he only felt that ... It was a little harsh.Suddenly, she felt uneasy.I don't need to be afraid of Li Hao ... Although the Silver Moon Warriors are still harmonious spirit cultivators, it's not a big deal for me to deal with the Silver Moon River.Why was he a little scared?"It's nothing, it's just so-so ..."He replied half-heartedly.Looking around, he was a bit dazed. There were so many tier 9 cultivators, but as the three great demon clan's Tier 9 cultivators fused with him, Tian Fang killed a few of them. As of this moment, there were no other tier 9 cultivators on the battlefield.The human King had already killed the other one without a sound. On the other hand, Emperor Yu was very calm and did not kill too many.With so many tier 9 experts, was there only Tian Fang and calamity left?At this moment, spring and autumn didn't know whether to be happy or sad. So ... A Grade 9 was just like this.

Chapter 3844 Calamity Gu (1)
As a large number of grade-9 experts died in battle, the Tribulation became more and more powerful.The Tribulation revealed a smile.Today, many people had died, but many people had also been fulfilled.For example, he, Spring Autumn, and Li Hao ...All of them had improved today, including the human King and the others. Now, the situation had changed. As he grew stronger, he felt that he might have a chance today!Tian Fang was strong, perhaps the strongest here.But ... Now, Spring Autumn had become stronger!Calamity looked at spring and autumn and laughed,""Chunqiu, the Dao Masters of the demon race have helped you. They definitely don't want the demon race to be destroyed here ..."Before he could finish his sentence, Chun Qiu sneered,""Even if I were to fight alone, I would never work with you. Lord of calamity ... Who among the ninth-rank spiritual beings that came out with you is still alive? Don't you have any points?"Do you think I'm an idiot?What about those grade-9 experts who fought with you against Tian Fang and the others?Where did he go?Where was he?Not a single one!This fellow had the nerve to say such words. If it were him, he would be too ashamed to say it.The Tribulation was slightly startled and frowned.That was true.He laughed at himself.He looked at Li Hao again, Li Hao ...Li Hao didn't bother to pay attention to him. He looked at the human King and the others and smiled."At this point, all the small fries have been cleared. Should I take care of the Tribulation, or should the few of you work together to take care of him? or should we save some strength and spar with fellow Daoist Tian Fang later?"Blood dripped from the human King's saber as he chuckled,""Can you do it alone?""Senior time, you really don't need our help?" Su Yu smiled as well.Spring Autumn was still a little confused.At this moment, although she felt that she was no weaker than Li Hao, the Tribulation was very powerful, and as more people died, the Tribulation would become stronger. Li Hao had only been on par with her before, but he should be weaker now.How ... Could he solve the Tribulation?She was a little dazed.Was he bragging?It can't be, right?The Lord of calamity's expression also changed. He looked at Li Hao.Solve me?Let alone you alone, even the human Kings would attack. Although they could kill a tier 9, they were all at the weak stage. How could they kill me?I'm not one of those people!"What big words!"The Lord of calamity's expression was cold.At this moment, he also felt that something was wrong. Without further delay, he vanished and used the power of destiny again. Li Hao's pillar of destiny was as dark as an abyss, even darker than before.This was a sign of certain death!Seeing this, he instantly felt a little more at ease. This was good!As for Li Hao, he instantly dodged and retreated. He looked at the crowd and said,""In that case, everyone, you're not going to participate and are preparing to save your strength to deal with Tian Fang?"The human King laughed as he held his saber."It's a pity that we don't participate in the final battle. Since the Tribulation is just a small fry as you said, why don't you show us ... Don't just brag. Since we came out, you've only killed one tier 9!""That's good too, I actually prefer to fight alone!"Li Hao smiled.In an instant, his smile disappeared.He looked at calamity and said,"since everyone can't wait, I'll send senior calamity on his way!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Laughable!"Calamity didn't believe that Li Hao could kill him. With a low roar, countless Thunderbolts and pillars of lightning appeared and enveloped Li Hao!At this moment, the lightning pillars were getting stronger and stronger.He was overjoyed. In fact, he was a little afraid of Li Hao's space-time travel. At this moment, Li Hao did not avoid him and was directly locked on by him!It was a good thing!In an instant, countless Thunderbolts in the entire pillar of lightning turned into Giants. All of them were extremely powerful and instantly fused into the pillar of lightning.The countless lightning pillars seemed to have turned into invincible Giants!They all hacked at Li Hao with their huge clubs!All the power of the great Dao was turned into dust and shattered instantly by the lightning pillar. The entire space seemed to be shattered, as if the world was being split apart!At the same time.The original body of tribulation disappeared and merged into the lightning territory. At this moment, the territory of tribulation was extremely similar to the day when Li Hao created the world.The Tribulation seemed to have become the master of opening the sky.And those lightning pillars seemed to have turned into gods that created the sky.Compared to Li Hao that day, the calamity today was much stronger. Opening the sky to strengthen himself was something calamity had learned from Li Hao. He had never thought of this before, but ever since Li Hao opened the sky and nurtured Su Yu, he had such thoughts.If Li Hao can do it, why can't I?The number of people who died today was more than the last time!Furthermore, it was even more powerful.Spirituality was everywhere, and the power of great DAOs filled the air. ……"What do we do?"At this moment, Chunqiu suddenly spoke, feeling a little nervous. Are we really going to just stand by and watch?Was this ... Appropriate?Although Li Hao said that he wanted to fight her one-on-one, she was still a little uneasy. She was worried that if Li Hao won, he would settle the score with her!Both the human King and Su Yu ignored her.The two of them didn't know why Li Hao wanted spring and autumn to gather the myriad DAOs, but they didn't want to participate in Li Hao's plan. At this moment, they didn't look at Li Hao. If Li Hao couldn't even solve the disaster ...That meant that he couldn't match Tian Fang at all.If this continued, he would be defeated and killed sooner or later!There was no difference between surviving the Tribulation and Li Hao dying in battle.At this moment, the two of them looked at Tian Fang, who had been calm all this time. Su Yu, who had not spoken much, suddenly said,""Senior Tian Fang, you've been waiting because you feel that Li Hao isn't strong enough, or because ... I'm afraid that I can't gather Origin Energy?"

Tian Fang, who hadn't paid much attention to him, suddenly looked at him.Su Yu had a gentle look on his face as he revealed a faint smile.""Senior, is it enough to kill calamity?"Tian Fang looked at him thoughtfully and said nothing.Su Yu laughed again."I'm a little confused now. I'm still dealing with the catastrophe. I wonder if you'd be willing to help me with my doubts?""Tell me," Tian Fang smiled."Zhan, what did you talk about with senior?"Su Yu seemed to be very curious, but also a little confused."I even thought about it. Is the battle just a layout of the seniors? an expert who hasn't left the neo martial world has actually gathered time. Once space and time are combined, does it mean that he has mastered time and space and has completely become the master of chaos?"He continued,"I'm also thinking, are senior and Zhan also two sides of the same coin?" He represented the kindness of the senior, and the senior ... Was evil! Or is it the other way around? is he evil while senior is good?""Interesting guess!" Tian Fang laughed.Two sides of the same coin.Time and space.Su Yu smiled faintly."It's just the opinion of one family. It might not be true. Senior, you've been waiting. Do you feel that there's not enough balance on both sides? I hope that the few of us can be considered to be of the same origin, all from neo martial arts ... At least, our Foundation is like this. If I, the three of us, are strong enough to rival you, does it mean that ... The opportunity you've been waiting for has come?"Tian Fang had only been watching the battle. It was impossible for an expert like him to be completely unprepared and allow them to kill the others. In fact, killing one person would make several people stronger.Both of them were constantly growing in battle!How could a smart person, who had been plotting in the chaos for a million years, allow such a thing to happen?"Or," Su Yu continued,"did I guess wrong? senior, you just want to refine us into your other side!"Su Yu laughed."Be it the yin-yang world, the Silvermoon world, or our myriad world, I have some understanding of them. The Dao is divided into two poles. In my opinion, senior's space has always been just one side, or that you already have two sides ... It shouldn't be. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to survive now."Tian Fang smiled again."Then, do you think I'm good or evil?"He looked at Su Yu, his eyes full of admiration."If Zhan is really the other side of me, is he good or evil?"Before Su Yu could say anything, second cat suddenly cried,""Bullshit! You can't be his other side, and he can't be your other side. You're not worthy!" Second cat seemed to be angry!Tian Fang looked at second cat and sighed,""Copying the great DAOs ... Is actually very interesting. It's also a core Dao of war, right? After all, he has only reached rank 6. To be able to achieve time and the Dao of duplication, his contributions can not be denied!"He didn't say whether fighting to the end was another side of him.He also did not say whether or not he had been waiting for the three of them to join forces, gather the natural source, and fuse the three sources into one. After they had achieved a balance with him, they would absorb and fuse into one, and become the true master of chaos.Since he didn't say, Su Yu could only guess.He couldn't tell, but he knew that Tian Fang hadn't made a move because he was waiting for Li Hao to become stronger, or perhaps ... Waiting for him and the human King to become stronger. The three parties were actually of the same origin.There were many thoughts in his mind.The moment he stepped out of the infinite worlds, he was immediately faced with an unparalleled battle. He knew too little about the world, and could only deduce some things from the conversations between everyone. At this moment, he didn't have any clear information, and it was difficult for him to deduce a complete clue in a short time.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  But he knew...That before they killed the calamity, they wouldn't be in great danger.However, once the Tribulation died ... Perhaps, it would be a true great crisis.He then looked around. At this moment, other than neo martial, Silver Moon, and myriad world, there was only one outsider in their camp-Spring Autumn!"Li Hao, did you really not think that the venerable sovereigns of the demon race might pass the power to the spring and autumn dynasty at the critical moment? He's letting spring and autumn gather the spirits of ten thousand emperors to increase spring and autumn's bargaining chip ..."At this moment, Su Yu was also very scheming.He did not believe that all of this was an accident.There were no accidents in this world.Even if there were, it wouldn't be at this time. Perhaps it was an accident that Li Hao left early, but to be able to survive and even gradually be roped in was definitely not an accident in his opinion.Was it silly Spring Autumn?So, he was easier to deceive?That might not be the case!He looked at the spring and autumn, the Dao of time, the ten thousand avatars, the past and the present ...Many thoughts flashed through his mind.However, he didn't know how Li Hao was going to make use of spring and autumn. Spring and autumn was powerful, but it was impossible for him to deal with Tian Fang!"Shi Guang?"He sank into deep thought. To let time control all of the avatars of spring and autumn, turning them into countless spring and autumn ... This was impossible. With such a powerful spring and autumn, time would probably find it hard to control it.……They were still chatting.At this moment, Li Hao was trapped in the lightning territory. The catastrophe at this moment was like the creator of the sky. The countless lightning Giants held huge clubs in their hands, and with a swing of the club, they seemed to open up a space!The Tribulation was actually very apprehensive!He was worried that others would interfere. He was also worried that Tian Fang would make a move.Therefore, he was very vigilant. He even deliberately concealed the power of fate in his tribulation domain and reversed the universe, hoping to deceive it with such a method!He already had a plan in his heart.

Chapter 3846 Calamity Gu (3)
He wasn't surprised by the death of those grade nine experts.Today, they had to die.He had his own goal today, and that was ... To split open the sky!The heavens of tribulation!He would complete the 10000 Dao laws, which were now around 9600 Dao laws. Even if he couldn't form spacetime, it didn't matter. At that time, his calamity Dao wouldn't be weaker than Tian Fang 's! Splitting open the sky was the fastest way to comprehend the great Dao.Once it was completely sealed, the flow of time would be different. In fact ... He could conceal everything and complete it without a sound.The Tribulation at this moment was somewhat excited.Those few people didn't seem to care about them.No one cared about them!Tian Fang didn't make a move, and neither did Li Hao's helpers. He was even more delighted. The chaos great Dao was also shaking at this moment. He was a tier 9 expert who had fused with chaos. At this moment, he began to secretly absorb the power of Chaos. It was as if Li Hao was too powerful and had to use the power of Chaos to strengthen himself!He had also judged that Tian Fang seemed to want to see Li Hao grow.Since that was the case ... Tian Fang probably wouldn't interfere with him extracting the primal Chaos energy. The facts proved that he had guessed correctly!Li Hao only dodged.He kept retreating!In the zone of tribulation, the lightning Giants seemed to be transforming into other Giants. Some of them emitted the Qi of life and death, while others emitted the Qi of yin and yang. The Tribulation became more and more excited.He appeared in the world like the God of creation. He was incomparably huge and had a bright smile!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  "Li Hao!""What do you think of this place?" he asked, his laughter echoing.At this moment, he had already completed the reversal of heaven and earth. The outside world could no longer see him. He finally heaved a sigh of relief.The Dao of heaven and earth, the Dao of fate, these great Dao were all used for this moment.It was used! He couldn't help but laugh. Those stage nine great DAOs had died, and their great DAOs had lost their spirituality. The power of their great DAOs was spreading wildly, and this had completed his second step, which was to absorb the power of 10000 great DAOs and fill the new Sky!Li Hao had opened the sky before.At this moment, he knew that Li Hao must have noticed something, but it was too late!I'm invincible here!Enormous great DAOs spread out in all directions. For the first time, the Tribulation revealed its own Dao domain, a complete great Dao domain. The countless Giants all seemed to have a great Dao above their heads.The Tribulation seemed to have turned itself into the river of the world.He looked at Li Hao."It's all thanks to you that I saw hope ... Otherwise, I wouldn't have dared to resist Tian Fang. Only I know how strong he is. But I can also see that he has been waiting for you to grow, or for time to grow ..."At this moment, the Tribulation seemed to want to vent the unwillingness in his heart and the timidity in his heart. "I've never dared to resist him since many years ago! Li Hao, Tian Fang's schemes are often understated, but the more you think about it, the more terrifying it is!""Back then, the master of order had 9800 great Dao. He could be said to be extremely powerful, but ... The master of order died. We were the ones who killed him!"The Tribulation seemed to be saying something crazy."But at the beginning, we didn't know that we were being used by Tian Fang. He didn't even show up personally. With a simple push, we became his thugs and killed the only order that could go against him!""I only found out after the order died ... This is troublesome. No one can keep Tian Fang in check. We can only stay together ...""However, as the chaos's spirit dissipated, we had no choice but to rely on it to find secret places for us to seek refuge and recover our spirit ... That's why we were trapped for a million years!"He poured out the things that he couldn't say before. At this moment, he was free. It was as if he had hope and the confidence to fight against the heavens!He laughed happily, Li Hao, I'm lucky to have you! I know that I'm not his match, but I also know that he might have been waiting for you, hoping to see you kill me ..."Li Hao dodged the Thunderbolt Giants 'attack and looked at calamity with a smile.""So, you think that you can comprehend 10000 DAOs and officially step into Tian Fang's level by opening the heaven of tribulation here today?""I can 't?"Calamity seemed to be very humble."You have experience, but I can't be 100% sure. Li Hao, Tian Fang is a big problem. He has been using you all this time. You know that you people hate being used the most ... Tell me, what flaws do my world have? after I kill you ... I will become stronger and then be able to kill Tian Fang ..."Li Hao took a look, waved his sword, and repelled a Thunder giant. As if he was patrolling, he nodded and said,""Grade 9 is really extraordinary. They're all Grade 9 spirits, and their Grade 9 Dao, great Dao, and spirituality are all very strong! So many people had died today, so his vitality was still very sufficient! With the Tribulation as the core, the myriad DAOs as the barrier, and the Dao spirit as the divine Spirit that created the world...This is actually on par with when I first created the myriad worlds, or perhaps even a level higher. The only difference is that I used to focus on time, while you used the Tribulation as your main focus. "Li Hao laughed."It's possible that the flow of time will be slightly different after the opening is successful. For example, hundreds of thousands of years in the myriad world is only a few months in the outside world. Without the river of time, there might only be a difference of a hundred years or a thousand years ..."Tribulation laughed!Li Hao seemed to be really giving him an evaluation, and he had to admit that he was very happy about it!

"Really? Is there only a difference in the flow of time?""More or less," Li Hao nodded."Su Yu!" Calamity's eyes showed a hint of joy."If I kill you, Li Hao, I'll train you as the next Su Yu. What do you think?" I'm the master of opening the sky, and you might be able to become the Emperor of this calamity!"Li Hao smiled and ignored him. He continued,""But ... Your world still lacks one thing ..." He said."What?""The source of the core!"  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  "In other words ... The source of great DAOs," Li Hao explained."Your great Dao of calamity should be completely integrated into the world ... Just like how I completely integrated the Dao of time as the core ...""I know!""That's why ... I'm bringing you along. I don't want to do this because I'll definitely be weak for a period of time. It's not suitable for me to do this now. I think I can get someone to replace you!"He looked at Li Hao. Yes, you.I'll let you replace him!Killing you, gathering your spirit, gathering your origin, and using your origin to maintain the world was the same. Li Hao was not a weakling at the moment. He was also a powerhouse. Once the world took shape, he would directly merge it with him!Two-way stacking!Only then would he be able to truly compete with Tian Fang!Li Hao fell into deep thought and nodded."Not bad. That's a good idea. Really. If you succeed, you really have a chance of going against Tian Fang!""You also agree?""Of course I agree!"Li Hao chuckled."That's why I've been staring at you, waiting for you, and watching you split open the sky. It's a tribulation. Why don't you completely integrate into this place and help me?" Your brain isn't good enough, so you probably can't win against Tian Fang. Let me do it, how about it?""You?"The Tribulation harrumphed coldly and then vanished. Heaven and earth began to compress, and the power of the great Dao transformed into rain that began to fall.The power of countless great DAOs appeared in the sky, and countless Giants around them charged at Li Hao!In the darkness, calamity was very satisfied. He even felt that he might be able to suppress Li Hao with the power of his domain.Was this the benefit of splitting open the sky?If he had known this earlier, he would have made preparations years ago!Of course, today was not too late. There might not have been such an opportunity in the earlier years.Meanwhile, Li Hao looked around.It was almost time!It might not be too late to hope that the Tribulation would be completely opened up. At this moment, the heart gate reappeared.The long sword turned into the heart gate!The Tribulation sneered. He had been tricked once, but would there be a second time?It was just an illusion!After suffering a loss once, Li Hao really felt that everyone was a fool. Could they suffer a second loss?The heart gate appeared!It was like a door that stood in the void. The next moment, a sword suddenly flew out from the heart door. One, two, three ...Countless swords! It covered the sky!At that moment, it was as if countless swords were flying out!Each sword seemed to represent a living being, and the appearance of a living being appeared.Everyone's face was filled with despair.At this moment, the countless swords contained only despair. They could not see any hope or future!The swords blotted out the sky and covered the Dao spirits. At this moment, the Dao spirits were attacking one after another, shattering the countless swords. With each Broken Sword, the aura of despair grew stronger!……At the same time.In that moment, the countless living beings of the countless worlds within the primordial chaos seemed to sense something. An even greater sense of despair exploded forth."It seems like ... We're going to be defeated ... Destroyed ..."They didn't know what had happened. They didn't know who would win or what the result would be.They could only feel an endless disaster!They even saw the collapse of the world, the death of countless people, the destruction of the world, the extinction of all life, the withering of the chaos, the entire world, the entire chaos, all gone!Despair!Endless despair!We can't see any hope.Why so?At this moment, the power of despair filled the entire chaos. A door seemed to have appeared in the hearts of countless people, sucking in all the despairing emotions.Tian Fang, who was talking to Su Yu and the others, suddenly looked around and raised his eyebrows.Suddenly, he revealed a smile!At this moment, his smile gradually brightened.Li Hao, you really didn't disappoint me. Even at this moment, you're still completing your path of strength. I'm afraid that tribulation can't defeat you. Very good. This is the person I've been waiting for.The human King and the others seemed to have sensed something as well, and they all revealed strange expressions.They all looked into the distance.At this moment, there seemed to be only a human figure there. He was surrounded by the Dao domain and couldn't be seen clearly. However, he could vaguely see ... A door!……Within the realm.The billions of swords of despair were being shattered continuously. However, the more they were shattered, the darker the door became. A calamity appeared, and his expression changed slightly,"the power of despair ..."The more broken it was, the more powerful it was!The sword was also in despair.He felt a headache coming on. This kind of special power was not easy to destroy. At this moment, he didn't say anything and just shouted. In the void, countless power of the great path appeared and instantly turned into a long river that attacked the countless long swords!Boom! Boom! Boom!The swords were broken one after another. The catastrophe was coming toward Li Hao. Since he couldn't destroy the sword intent of despair, he would ... Kill him!I'll kill your true body, destroy your true body, and destroy your spirit!

This way, he could get it done once and for all.As the Tribulation approached, Li Hao seemed to be in despair. The more desperate he was, the stronger his sword intent became.A black sword appeared in his hand, trembling slightly.The sword seemed to have become one with him.Despair, unwillingness, violence, darkness, chaos ...All sorts of emotions were brewing within.At this moment, Li Hao's long sword pointed at the void. Suddenly, blood dripped from the long sword, and the blood seemed to be writing something in the void.In an instant, a string of words appeared!"Tribulation!"As soon as the word 'calamity' came out, countless forces of calamity swarmed over. Venerable sovereign calamity shouted in a low voice,""Break!"BOOM!The power of the Tribulation exploded one after another. His expression was ugly, but he quickly recovered.A small trick!Hoping to weaken my tribulation power, wishful thinking.The divine text of "calamity" only took away part of the power of calamity, but Li Hao didn't care. The divine text of "calamity" disappeared in an instant, as if it had spread upward and disappeared from the world.Eh?The Tribulation was stunned. Although it was not weakened much, it had to be said that the divine text was indeed a little troublesome for him. Li Hao's spirituality was extremely strong. If he were to forcibly control it, he might be able to take away some of the power of the Tribulation.However, this fellow did not seem to care and directly teleported the divine text away.The Tribulation was a little puzzled."But I don't care anymore. If you give up on your own, then you're just looking for death.However, at this moment, Li Hao exhaled. Suddenly, the heart gate in front of him completely shattered. The gate seemed to have shattered into tens of thousands of pieces, each piece like a stone.In an instant, a great Dao was constructed between heaven and earth!The catastrophe instantly appeared in the great Dao. With a stomp of his foot, countless fragments were shattered, but they recovered in the blink of an eye. Li Hao chuckled and said,""In this world, time and space are meaningless. Martial masters like us ... Will always walk the path of the martial world!" What?Martial arts world?As the Tribulation came to an end, the great Dao under his feet suddenly glowed with Saber Light and sword shadows, and he suddenly felt lofty and heroic!"The martial world is the path of a Martial Master!"Li Hao smiled. Holding his sword, he walked toward the road in front of him."I won't stop you from opening the sky during the calamity. If I don't have an opponent, how can I still be a martial world?""Jianghu is lively and interesting. There's life and death, desires, indomitable will, indomitable spirit, perseverance, and nameless ..."The thousands of fragments, wrapped in despair, gradually extended some other emotions.At this moment, many human figures seemed to appear in front of the Tribulation.It was like a Jianghu dream! On the road, figures appeared one after another. Some laughed heartily in the pugilistic world, some lost their luster, some slaughtered the people, some fought against foreign enemies, some drew their bows and shot Eagles, and some toured the mountains and rivers with beautiful women ...This was the world in Li Hao's eyes."What's so good about Shi Guang? Whether it's time and space or the universe, is there any meaning to all DAOs and chaos?"Holding his sword, Li Hao walked over step by step.As for the Lord of the Tribulation, with a loud shout, he crushed the road of Jianghu with one foot!However, in the blink of an eye, he recovered.Li Hao laughed."The martial world is the martial world of men and living creatures. Where there are people, there is a martial world!" Whether it's a battle of strength, a battle of magic, or a battle of wisdom, as long as you and I are here, the martial world will be here!""You're deliberately mystifying!"What Jianghu road?He didn't believe in tribulation, and couldn't shatter it. In the blink of an eye, the power of tribulation exploded out, completely tearing apart the great Dao. However, in the blink of an eye, it was once again United!Li Hao walked over step by step."It's useless. This path doesn't have much use. For me, the only use ... Is that there's a little fairness here that's not worth mentioning!"In an instant, the great Dao completely enveloped the Tribulation. The Tribulation only felt the power of the great Dao in his body being compressed in an instant.And Li Hao was the same!He stood in the middle of the path, looking at the Tribulation and smiling,""Silver Moon Li Hao, please enlighten me!"The Tribulation's expression turned ugly. What the hell?"This is the way of the martial arts world. Senior, there is an unwritten rule in Silver Moon pugilistic world. If both sides are equal in strength, you either accept my challenge or admit defeat. If you admit defeat, I'll let you out. If you don't admit defeat, you can only accept the challenge. Life and death are determined by fate!""What a joke!"The Tribulation roared again. Countless Thunder Giants appeared outside and attacked Jiang Hu Dao. However, the moment a Thunder giant entered the Dao, it seemed to lose all its energy!Li Hao's sword glowed, and the head of a lightning giant fell off. It was Dao Ling!However, at this moment, his Dao spirit seemed to have been destroyed!He was swallowed by countless feelings of despair!Li Hao laughed."When you and I spar, others can only watch. This is one of the rare fairness in the martial arts world ... Of course, this is Silver Moon martial arts world!"It was only at this moment that calamity's expression changed.He could sense that one of his DAOs ... Had really been severed, and it was the kind that could not be recovered!How could this be?  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  This is my world!I am the master of this place!Li Hao had actually opened up an absolute domain in his world. The Dao of the martial world he spoke of didn't sound impressive, but ... It was ridiculously strong!"How is that possible?"The Tribulation was still in disbelief."This is my world!"Li Hao nodded."It's yours. But as I said, where there are people, there are conflicts. It's the same no matter where you are!" The end of the pugilistic world might be despair, so I used despair as a supplement to open this path! You can't break through the Tribulation unless you're much stronger than me. Tian Fang might have a chance, but you can 'T. Do you accept the challenge?"

"What if I don't accept the challenge?" Jie Nan's expression turned ugly.Li Hao laughed,"then I'll make the decision!" I want this day! This world, I want it. This domain, I want it!"What?The Tribulation actually wanted to try, but he didn't believe it!However ... The next moment, she thought of Li Hao's many tricks. Perhaps ... There was really such a possibility. When Li Hao's Holy prose disappeared just now, perhaps ... There was something wrong."Then come!" His eyes flashed with a sharp glint."Thank you for your guidance!"In an instant, Li Hao seemed to have transformed into a fierce tiger. He walked in the air and seemed to be surrounded by people on both sides of the road. The Tribulation also tried to mobilize the power of great DAOs, and he only heaved a sigh of relief when he found that he could still use it. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ However, he felt that there was something hidden within, but this did not affect his strength much.He also instantly burst out and charged at Li Hao!But in the next moment, his expression changed. Everyone was the same. The power of a great Dao couldn't be released, but Li Hao was as fierce as a Tiger!Li Hao let out an ear-piercing howl!"Kill!"The long sword whizzed over. Light and darkness appeared, the five elements appeared, yin and yang appeared, and life and death appeared!In an instant, it was as if 10000 forces had gathered, shocking people's hearts!With a loud boom, the catastrophe punch was thrown out. Endless despair spread over the long sword, and the power of catastrophe in his body was turbulent!A bloody gash appeared on the Tribulation fist.He immediately frowned!"Is this your Silver Moon force?""Senior, one more time!" Li Hao nodded.In an instant, the sword was drawn!In the eyes of the Tribulation, Li Hao was like a God of heaven and earth. He was suppressed by the power of heaven and earth. The Tribulation's expression changed. This is my territory. It shouldn't be like this!He crushed the great Dao under his feet, but the great Dao instantly turned into a path again, blocking his breakthrough. The Tribulation was extremely irritable. How could there be such a special great Dao?It instantly regrouped after breaking!What was this?He couldn't care about this anymore. He dodged Li Hao in a sorry state, but in just an instant, Li Hao's foot kicked towards him like a snake's tail. In an instant, with a crack, he kicked the Tribulation that he couldn't avoid in time.Kachaa!As if his bones were broken, calamity groaned in disbelief."How could ..."Li Hao ignored him. The blood Qi in his body surged and instantly formed a saber. The saber fused with the sword, and the black sword instantly turned red!Fight and kill!The silent sword, mixed with great momentum, instantly stabbed out!BOOM!With a loud sound, calamity blocked it with his fists. However, his fists were instantly penetrated and blood flowed out. He was still in disbelief. "It's an illusion!"He couldn't block Li Hao's sword!Not only that, but his speed and the power of his great DAOs seemed to be sealed in his body. Li Hao seemed to be the same, but Li Hao ... Was more familiar with the world than him!Therefore, even if they were on par with each other, they were completely suppressed by Li Hao! "It's boring to fly in the sky and hide in the earth on the path of martial arts. I make the decisions in my martial arts world. The Tribulation is here ... You and I, our strength hasn't changed, but some things have changed. "For example, the rules!Yes, this was a kind of order, a kind of rule!Strength, you still have the same strength, but you've lost something."Impossible!" Jie Nan angrily shouted. This Dao is too unfair to me. There must be a way to break this Dao!"This Dao couldn't possibly be so difficult to deal with.Otherwise, how could he win?There was no invincible Dao!Li Hao smiled."Yes. It's the foundation of despair!" "All chaotic souls will no longer be in despair. This Dao will collapse on its own. You are the representative of the Tribulation. When do you think the Tribulation will disappear and the martial world will disappear? Unless ... There are no more disasters in this world, there will be a martial world!""How could ..."This Dao was based on despair!If despair did not dissipate, and the great Dao did not dissipate, was there still such a great Dao in the world?"You can do it too. The tribulations won't go away, the great Dao won't go away, but you ... Don't understand!"Li Hao smiled. You don't understand.In an instant, the sword was drawn!At this moment, he was like a Martial Master in the pugilistic world, as if he had returned to the past. Since he couldn't weaken his opponent or make himself stronger, he would bring his opponent into the field he was best at!In this place, the strength remained the same, but the methods had changed.This is my chance!Everyone was still as strong as before, but there were many restrictions here. This was the way of the martial world.This was also Li Hao's greatest realization over the years.It was also his persistence!It could even be a form of faith.The Tribulation was bathed in blood and roared madly. This was impossible, impossible!He began to counterattack madly!But here, Li Hao punched and kicked, and his sword whistled. In the blink of an eye, tribulation's body was riddled with wounds. The power of great DAOs was shattered by Li Hao's sword and scattered between heaven and earth! The Tribulation was getting weaker and weaker, and its eyes were blood red!Suddenly, as if he had seized the opportunity, he threw a punch. The mountains collapsed and the earth cracked. Li Hao staggered.
