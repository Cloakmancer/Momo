He didn't say anything else."This is not bad. It's good enough that you can learn it, but it's also good that you can't pass it on to others ... What's wrong with improving your physique behind closed doors?" Yuan Shuo chimed in.Everyone thought about it and agreed.Li Hao smiled and took out another world.""Alright, let's not talk about this. Everyone is learning, so let's just pretend that we didn't see it. If it's too smelly and you can't help it, just seal your sense of smell! Improving one's Constitution and removing impurities are extremely helpful for the Dao of chaos. For someone like the giant pincer who cultivates the Dao of chaos, there are too many chaotic DAOs. You don't need to do anything special to remove more of them. You can cultivate this Dao for a few decades and release it a few times a day ... After a few decades, you can become a monarch yourself!"At this moment, the giant pincer was extremely happy and excited. It did not seem to have any intention of rejecting this Dao and hurriedly nodded,""Thank you for your guidance, my Lord!"With this technique, even if he didn't learn anything else, he felt that he would be able to slowly eliminate all the other DAOs and become a venerable sovereign!This was just as the Silver Moon King had said, a path to the heavens!Sure enough, in the eyes of these people, any Dao was a great Dao that led directly to venerable sovereigns."Continue!"Li Hao smiled and said,'during this process, I hope that ... Someone can become a venerable sovereign! The Silver Moon world is only at level four and can accommodate venerable sovereigns. Even if it is a dual-Dao universe, there are only about 20 to 30 people. If Qian Wuliang and the others don't enter level five, it will be difficult to increase the number ... Now, it has already accommodated many. If we miss this opportunity, we can only wait for them to enter level five first!"Everyone tensed up and didn't say anything else. Those who were a little embarrassed just now ... Instantly, smoke rose from behind them!It would be easier to vindicate Dao if the impurities were removed!Li Hao hesitated for a moment, but he still secretly recorded this spectacular scene. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Of course, I won't tell anyone.Li Hao thought to himself, I'm not that kind of person. Besides, this scene is too interesting. If there's an opportunity in the future, I'll stuff it into the great path and treat it as a little surprise for future generations.The world continued to be torn apart.The removal of the Dao net, the fusion of the great DAOs, the extraction of the world's power, and the shattering of countless great Dao crystals. The two cats ate a little of the world's origin, and the rest were fused into the Silvermoon world.Gradually, the entire Silvermoon world and the great Dao universe began to grow crazily!As for the others, their eyes became clearer.Dao seemed to be very simple!After seeing the great DAOs of the same nature in different worlds, everyone was touched. The heaven-reaching magic not only helped them remove impurities, but it also helped them to merge the power of the great DAOs.In an instant, the branches on the two rivers of the great Dao suddenly began to grow rapidly, and extremely thick branch rivers continued to appear.That was because someone had taken a step further in the great Dao and had already opened up a Branch River.This also meant that ... The venerable sovereign was right in front of him.The void was also like cleaning up after the aftermath. It constantly destroyed worlds and destroyed the chaotic great Dao. After reviving it, it was thrown into the river of great Dao.At this moment, Li Hao was extremely old and somewhat powerless.His physical body could no longer withstand the constant usage of time. It was only through Kong Ji and himself trying to resuscitate that his physical body did not collapse completely.Under this crazy demolition and shattering of great Dao crystals, everyone began to advance.Such an opportunity was truly too rare.……In an instant, all kinds of forces burst out in the great path universe.Fist force, Saber Force, sword force, spear force ... All of them were erupting. The first venerable sovereign was slightly out of Li Hao's expectations. At this moment, venerable the sword couldn't help but take another look. In fact, he recognized that person. When he left, that person was still alive.Li Daozong!The ninth Division commander!When li daoheng died, Li Hao passed on li daoheng's comprehension of the sword way to the ninth master. Today, with the ninth master's accumulation and the comprehension of li daoheng's sword intent, his sword intent soared to the sky and he was the first to step into the venerable sovereign level!Venerable the sword looked at him from head to toe, as if he had seen something, and felt a little regretful.It was Li Daozong, not li daoheng.He didn't ask much, but he knew that li daoheng ... Might have done something rebellious and was probably dead. Li Daozong's sword intent had some shadow of his brother.The ninth master did not need to go through the Thunder tribulation to become a venerable sovereign, so he did not follow the original Dao.At this moment, his body had transformed. The great path ran through the long river, leaving a long river of sword Dao. He was not the only one who cultivated the sword. However, there were many sword Dao. If other sword cultivators wanted to vindicate their Dao, there would not be much conflict.Unless the two of them cultivated the same sword Dao. That would be troublesome.After the ninth Division, someone else started to vindicate Dao.This time, it was from Silver moon's side. Li Hao had originally thought that his master might be faster ... But reality proved that he was overthinking things. Yuan Shuo did not seem to show any signs of Dao validation, but skysword had actually validated his Dao with sword intent.Perhaps it was because of the ninth master's influence, or because there were more sword cultivators here and Tian Jian's mind was purer, his speed of Dao validation was not slow.He was slightly surprised!Li Hao only glanced at it and didn't say anything. Just because he had a pure mind didn't mean he was stupid. He had enough understanding of Dao and didn't lack energy. It wasn't too difficult to vindicate Dao.Even the boorish Nan Quan was showing signs of Dao vindication at this moment. Perhaps, there would be another fist Dao venerable sovereign soon.As for hei Bao and Hong Yitang, they had also entered level four. The entire world was expanding.Within the Silver Moon realm, countless cultivators were also madly improving.This was a Grand feast!Revelry!Li Hao was upgrading the entire world and all the cultivators at the cost of six billion great Dao crystals in 46 worlds.,m The seventh rank venerable sovereigns also had some gains.It wasn't about the improvement of strength, but the understanding of Dao. There were some things that didn't need Li Hao's explanation. They could see for themselves, and the more they saw, the more they could understand.In fact, Li Hao had also gained a lot. His understanding of Dao had deepened.There was even a faint trace of the rebirth of the great Dao, but he suppressed it. If he only wanted to become a seventh rank venerable sovereign of the six paths, he would have to accumulate more experience.……On this day, the entire Silver Moon began to improve greatly.On this day, the major factions of the four-sided region were also constantly working together.The emergence of new martial arts, the power of the human King, and the existence of the group of people from Tian Fang had become the center of the conversation at this moment. Other than the light being excluded, countless worlds were discussing how to deal with it.This was the disaster of the four-sided domain!Tribulation of the four directions!

3071 Chapter 503
This was a revelry!The revelry of cultivation.There had never been a venerable sovereign who had spent so many resources on a group of non-venerable sovereigns. More than 40 worlds, including many medium-level worlds, had advanced to venerable sovereign just for a group of weak people!There had also never been a time Dao cultivator who would reverse time and go back in time to face the Dao net for a bunch of weaklings.All of this had never happened before.Was it worth it?To many people, it was not worth it. With so many medium and elementary worlds, if he gave them to a few rank three venerable sovereigns to use, he might be able to recruit dozens of venerable sovereigns to work for him in a day.It was only the first level to cultivate a group of Heavenly Kings and become venerable sovereigns!If he recruited some third level venerable sovereigns, he might be able to reach the fourth level.At that time, they would be a group of medium venerable sovereigns.A fourth level venerable sovereign could fight two to three third level venerable sovereigns, five to six second level venerable sovereigns, and ten first level venerable sovereigns could barely fight against a fourth level venerable sovereign. This was a middle level venerable sovereign!But for Li Hao ... Why would he train outsiders?I'm happy to waste the resources.The rich were willful!In total, it was only ten billion great Dao crystals. Was that a lot?A lot of them!But I'm ... Happy to do so!I like to see the Silver Moon people laugh. So what if they were to train venerable sovereigns outside, even if they had reached the fourth rank?Venerable sovereigns kept appearing.The ninth master had proven his way, and the sky sword was next.After sky sword succeeded, the next one was actually director Zhao. This expert who stayed behind was actually one step faster than the others. He opened up a branch in the long river of Dao and succeeded in vindication.Then, the fist intent soared. Li Hao thought it was the southern Fist ...He turned around and smiled.Yao si!This old night patrolman Minister was silent and silent, but he actually succeeded in vindication just like that. Nanquan was so angry that he roared,"“艹!”The number one position of the fist Dao was gone!Just one more step!He had been staring at the northern fist and didn't pay much attention to Yao si. He thought that old man Yao wasn't much and had a high probability of being even slower. Good fellow, they had launched a surprise attack!Old man, I'm so angry!The southern Fist was furious!Just as he was getting over his anger, an incomparably majestic fist of the great path appeared between heaven and earth. Northern fist had a wretched look on his face, and this little old man looked at him with a smile.With who?Nanquan was furious!"Northern fist!""Why are you calling me big brother?" "Little he, do you have any objections?" bei Quan asked with a smile.“……”The southern Fist was sullen.I'm not a venerable sovereign yet, so I have no opinion.Li Hao was also surprised. He couldn't help but laugh. He had just watched for a while. Nanquan seemed to have the strongest aura, and he was about to be the number one in Daoism ... But he was gone.He was pushed down just like that!While Southern Fist was still depressed, BA Dao's face was cold. His long blade swept across the sky and directly opened a tributary above the river. It was actually not the river of truth, but the river of Phantom!Qian Wuliang was also a bit surprised, but he soon felt relieved. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Most of these Silver Moon venerable sovereigns had vindicated their Dao through the river of truth. In the end, BA Dao had walked The Phantom path and became a venerable sovereign of The Phantom path.Just as Qian Wuliang was thinking about this, a long spear shot out from the sky in the next second!Hou Xiaochen, who looked like a gentleman, thrust his spear forward, creating a branch in the void Dao River. This was the will of the inheritance of the new martial, God-splitting Thearch.Another expert had succeeded in Dao vindication!Hou Xiaochen chuckled as he looked at Yuan Shuo. Seeing that Yuan Shuo was still closing his eyes, he chuckled.Old demon Yuan was always a step slower.Dao integration cultivators and venerable sovereigns were one step slower.The title of the blind old demon!At this point, the 9th Division commander, sky sword, BA Dao, bei Quan, Yao si, director Zhao, and hou Xiaochen had all succeeded.The others were a little anxious.Right at this moment, a bull's roar suddenly resounded through the world. A Green Bull stomped through the world, its huge body suppressing the long river, and its horns directly pushed out a tributary in the long river!Li Fuhai roared and his qi and blood rushed to the sky!The third venerable sovereign of the water power family had appeared!Its father's power was extraordinary, and its ancestor, water power, were both venerable sovereigns. Today, it had also stepped into the ranks of venerable sovereigns by following the path of the Silver Moon.Li Fuhai was overjoyed!Even venerable the sword couldn't help but take another look. He stood beside Li Hao and sighed,""The waterpower family ..."He was speechless!They were an opportunist clan, but ... They made the right choice every time. One had to admit that they were really good at this. This bull had actually advanced to the rank of a venerable sovereign. The shuiliu clan wasn't too powerful. Venerable sword knew that its ancestor, shuiliu, was only a third stage venerable sovereign. Its father, whose strength was extraordinary, had taken the title of sea-suppressing envoy and was one step ahead of him. Now, he was already a fourth stage venerable sovereign.Now, li Fuhai had also advanced to venerable sovereign. Although none of them were strong, it was already extremely rare!He knew li Fuhai and other new martial artists.At this moment, he glanced around. The ninth Master Teacher, li Fuhai, and the Zhang family had become venerable sovereigns. Zhang an's venerable sovereign was a little special. He did not have the melting Silvermoon universe, but he was still a venerable sovereign.Three!There were quite a number of neo martial artists, and all of them had left before the Silver Moon people. However, there were many venerable sovereigns in the Silver Moon, so there were a lot fewer neo martial artists.He looked around ...From the corner of his eye, he glanced at the several neo martial artists and then at Li Hao. Li Hao felt their gazes. Venerable the sword raised his eyebrows. Li Hao laughed and nodded.Sword Saint laughed too.In the next moment, turtle Guardian, who was still struggling, suddenly felt a sword light appear. His face paled. This familiar sword light was truly frightening!

3072 Chapter 503
Just as this thought flashed through his mind, there was a crack, and the turtle shell cracked. In the next second, something seemed to have fused into the turtle shell.Before it could react, a vast power suddenly appeared.In an instant, the great Dao rushed straight into the long river!A branch appeared."Although it's not long for me, I heard that you have guarded heaven battling city for 100000 years in Silver Moon!" Today, I'll help you get rid of your weapon and forge your divine soul! Black Tortoise, from now on, you're free. In the past, you were enemies with neo martial and were killed by me. I forged a weapon with my divine soul ... Today, I'll repay you for your 100000 years of work!"The memories of the past appeared.The turtle Guardian was not a weapon spirit.In the new martial era, killing demonic beasts and forging divine weapons were what many people in the new martial world did. No one knew how many human Kings had been killed in the past.Guardian turtle was a great demon of the neo martial era in the past.It was killed by venerable the sword and turned into a divine weapon. Later, it was owned by the Wang family. After the destruction of the new martial arts, the turtle guarded heaven battling city for 100000 years. Today, venerable the sword saw that it was trapped by its original body and the divine weapon, unable to escape.Using the sword Dao intent to help it escape and forge a new Dao.It was very simple for a Sword Saint to vindicate Dao for others.It was really simple.Perhaps, it was even simpler than the two Dao Masters. This Dao universe actually ... Had a very, very big relationship with him. However, he was the previous Silver Moon King, not the current one.Therefore, he had to look at Li Hao first, and Li Hao had agreed. Only then did he help the weapon spirit. He didn't help anyone else, but protected it.On the other side, the turtle Guardian had successfully proven his Dao and seemed to have been stimulated. The first neo martial artist to integrate the Dao of the Silver Moon, director Wang Ye, roared and the long river of the great Dao appeared. He took a step to the sky and entered the venerable sovereign realm.Director Wang was overjoyed and laughed heartily. He looked at the 9th Division commander with excitement!He had also succeeded!Among the new martial artists, the first to come into contact with Li Hao were the ninth Division commander, director Wang, and Guardian turtle. Now, they had all successfully advanced.The next moment, a cat Palace appeared on the top of half of the new martial era cultivators, the small tree, and the sovereign guards. Even venerable the sword was surprised. He glanced at the small tree and smiled. In an instant, the branches of the small tree grew and ran across the world. The life force was extremely rich. In the blink of an eye, the small tree grew a lot and the aura of a venerable sovereign appeared.As for the Redwood tree that had Lin Hongyu's back and had been working with her all this while, it had also surpassed the old sage, general Huai, at this moment. The aura of the Redwood tree was extremely chaotic, and vaguely, there was a chaotic aura emerging.Above the river, it had opened up its own unique chaos Dao.Back then, it had given up the life Dao to the little tree Thearch guard in order to be pampered. It had chosen the chaos Dao on its own. After entering the chaos, it had realized that the so-called Chaos Dao was very chaotic.It was very difficult to become a chaos Dao Emperor!In the end, he focused on the chaos in the chaos. At this moment, he had vindicated the chaos Dao!Guardian turtle, director Wang, little tree, and Redwood, these cultivators of the new martial era, had proven their Dao one after another. This made the Silver Moon Martial Master anxious. These guys were all taking up the spots.Even at this moment, there were still people madly attacking! In the distance, a person's aura of light and darkness appeared. Kong Ji was a little surprised. He took a look and quickly said,"The alternation of light and darkness ... It's interesting, but the dark element is a little weak and can't be balanced. I didn't achieve the two poles, but it's not bad ..."BOOM!The woman seemed to have lost control. Kong Ji glanced at Li Hao, and Li Hao nodded. Kong Ji waved his hand, and a dark aura poured into the radiant woman's body. In an instant, light and darkness reached a temporary balance.Aunty radiance shouted and instantly, light and darkness appeared. A great Dao was opened up.She turned to look at Kong Ji, then at Li Hao, and smiled. She looked at Kong Ji shyly, but didn't say anything.Li Hao was stunned. Kong Ji was a little confused. After a while, he looked at Li Hao."What do you mean?""I've taken a fancy to you!"“……”Kong Ji opened his mouth, and after a while, he smiled awkwardly.This little girl ... Yes, in Li Hao's eyes, she was an Auntie, but in his eyes, aunt Guangming was still very young ... And not very good-looking. It was just that it wasn't easy for her to fix the light and dark image, so he decided to help her.Why are you looking at me like that?Don't mess around!I'm focused on the Dao and don't have this hobby. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao tried to hold back his laughter until his internal organs almost exploded.After a long time, he sent a voice transmission, after her light and darkness are balanced, she will become beautiful ... Cultivators shouldn't care about their appearance!“……”He was silent and couldn't be bothered to pay attention to this boring guy.At this moment, Li Hao looked around. A large number of cultivators were vindicating their Dao as venerable sovereigns, and the number of spots was decreasing, but ... Two very important people had not vindicated their Dao.One of them was Yuan Shuo, and the other was Liu Long.To Li Hao, these two people had different meanings.One was the teacher, the other was the boss.But ... They didn't vindicate Dao.He felt that Liu Long's words were normal. Although Liu Long was also at the ninth level of Dao integration, boss had cultivated the ninth-stage heavenly refinement force, so he had more than enough power to burst out, but his comprehension was lacking. If Liu Long had enough talent, he would not have stayed in the Silver City as a Captain and would have become a super long ago.Moreover, he had not been able to comprehend force.Strictly speaking, Li Hao was biased towards Liu Long.He glanced at Liu Long, but before he could speak, the Black Panther beside him suddenly opened its mouth. This time, it didn't ask Li Hao, but directly spat out the power of countless great DAOs toward Liu Long, even mixed with a strong heaven's will.

3073 Chapter 503
The will of the heavens supports this!It was as if the gods had helped Liu Long. In an instant, his mind became incomparably clear, as if he had suddenly understood all the barriers. He was a little dazed, and huge waves surged into the sky. In the blink of an eye, the ninth refinement force erupted, and with a loud bang, a branch was blasted out of the long river of Dao.He looked at the Black Panther with a complicated expression.I ... Relied on my dog to advance!The Black Panther wagged its tail in excitement. It had been cultivating the ninth-form force all this time, and its cultivation level was quite profound. Strictly speaking, Liu Long could be considered as half of its master.Seeing that everyone else was vindicating their DAOs while Liu Long remained still, it became anxious.That was why he didn't care about the rules and attacked Li Hao without even asking him.At this moment, he turned to look at Li Hao, feeling a little guilty.Li Hao smiled, but didn't say anything. Even if Heibao didn't make a move, he would. In the end, there was still a relationship between friends and relatives.If it was someone else, he would just take a look.But Liu Long ... Could vindicate Dao, that would be the best.Liu Long, on the other hand, was a little dejected. To rely on Gou 'Zi's help to advance ... It was more or less a little embarrassing. The key was that it was fine for others, but his son was watching from the side. This ... Made him a little embarrassed.If they were all old acquaintances, he would not mind, but ... At this moment, looking at his son's curious and surprised expression, he felt a little helpless and could only send a message.""What are you looking at!""Father ... This ... This is ... The legendary dog of the world?""Is there a problem?""No... Father, I'm just curious. Why did it help you?""It's none of your business!""No... The way it looks at its father ... Is a little different ..."Liu Long was speechless! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It's none of your business!On the other hand, Liu Yin's mother, Liu Yan, who was also a member of Li Hao's team, suddenly sent a voice transmission when she saw this.""Yin 'er, Black Panther is the master of the world. In the early years, he left Silver City with me, Marchioness Silvermoon, and your father. The most correct thing your father did back then was to teach Marchioness Silvermoon the nine-refined force. Along the way, Black Panther also learned it. Your father had always been proud of it, saying that he was half a disciple of his ... So, he can be considered your eldest senior brother!"“……”Liu Yin was stunned while Liu Yan quickly transmitted her voice,""Just remember it and don't say anything else. This is the master of the world! Now, he had stepped into the fourth stage and was about to enter the fifth stage venerable sovereign realm! Don't say too much on normal days in case everyone gets jealous. At the critical moment ... If you advance to venerable sovereign one day and you don't have enough spots ... Maybe ... You can ask Black Panther for help. "Liu Yin was slightly surprised. His father had never mentioned this before.In that case, my Liu family can be said to be a local resident! His father had only said that he had left Silver City with Silvermoon Duke, but he didn't say much. Now, it seemed that things were different.He could tell that Silver moon's boss, director Zhao, had always given his father a lot of face. The entire Silvermoon elder group also gave him some face.Now that his mother said this, he understood. Perhaps ... The relationship between the Liu family and the Marchioness of Silvermoon was different!I don't know about that.I only know that they are all old people left behind by the Marchioness Silvermoon. If I had known earlier ... I might have been even more arrogant?"Mother, why didn't you advance to venerable sovereign? why are you talking now ...""No need, my aptitude isn't good enough. It's a waste to advance!"Liu Yan interrupted her son. Three venerable sovereigns in a sect?Do you think you are the son of the Marchioness of Silvermoon?She knew that her husband, Liu Long, would definitely advance to the next stage. However, even though she was also at the ninth level of Dao integration, she was still far from it. Her son, on the other hand, had good aptitude and had made some mistakes before. It was actually possible for her to advance to the venerable sovereign realm. Given their friendship back then, Li Hao would not refuse her as long as she asked!The demon hunting squad only had a few members.She, Liu Long, Li Hao, Wu Chao, Chen Jian, yunyao, and Li Hao.But now ... He had asked for a favor, and his son had advanced, so there might be no more seats left. There were only so many seats, and he was giving his family three. Li Hao didn't care, but the others might be dissatisfied.That would be troublesome!As such, she chose not to speak. She looked at her old teammates from afar, and none of them spoke either. Their aptitudes were actually slightly worse, and they couldn't compare to the Silver Moon 36.These people were the true talents. Before superpowers appeared, they had relied on their own talents to run amuck.Since the quota was limited, he would let this group of people advance first.These thoughts, no one said, but everyone knew.Even the carefree Liu Yan of the past had learned to think about such things. She had stayed in Silver Moon for 500 years and was no longer the Liu Yan of the past.Along with Liu Long, with the help of Black Panther, he advanced.Li Hao looked at Qian Wuliang and then at Hong Yitang and said,""You can choose one based on your own needs ... If you lack anything, just tell me!"They were the Masters of the great Dao, and Li Hao had actually overstepped his boundaries. However, Li Hao was the one providing the resources, and he was the Silver Moon King in everyone's eyes, so the two masters of the great Dao had not said anything before.Hearing Li Hao's words, Qian Wuliang was a bit happy, but Hong Yitang had mixed feelings.He glanced at his daughter in the crowd ... And really wanted to help her.

3074 Chapter 503
His daughter was also one of the five great commanders of the demon-hunter guard Army. She had improved quite a bit over the years. Hong Qing had always followed him and walked the path of the sword. He had also learned the path of the sword from Li Hao, and his attainments in the path of the sword were not bad.But ...At this moment, the quota for venerable sovereigns was indeed limited, and many people had yet to prove their Dao.Even Wang Ming, who had followed him in the early years, hadn't vindicated Dao. There was also Yu dami, Jin gun, Nan Quan, Hao lianchuan ...A large number of people had yet to vindicate Dao."I ..."Li Hao interrupted him."Don't worry. As they vindicate their DAOs, you're also digesting the power of your DAOs, and your world is improving ... You're only at level four now, but level six isn't far away. You don't lack spots!"This was only the beginning!Previously, when he mentioned the quota, he was just trying to stimulate everyone. There was no way he was really lacking in people.Tier 7 was too difficult!However, he had yet to digest the energy accumulation process of rank-6 and would need some time. Wouldn't there be more spots later on?He was just a step late!Hearing Li Hao's words, Hong Yitang felt much more at ease. 'That's right, I've thought too much. Since that's the case ... If there's no shortage of spots in the future ... But the future will depend on one's ability. There might not be a chance like today, with Li Hao's help.'His heart moved."I ... Then I ... Want Hong Xiu to vindicate Dao." p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  “……”Li Hao was speechless. Old pervert.He had a wife and forgot about his daughter, Hong Xiu ...I thought you were talking about Hong Qing.Or ... According to your habits, your disciple Hong Hao will do as well.In the end, it was your wife. How shameless.Li Hao didn't know much about Hong Xiu, but he knew that she was a kind person. In the early years, she adopted a group of orphans with Hong Yitang. Later, when the West was in trouble, Hong Xiu took the members of the earth-covered sword sect to the West and adopted a large number of people.In fact, it was even once thought to be the incarnation of the moon goddess.Previously, she had been staying at Silvermoon and had not been too conspicuous. At this moment, she had barely reached the ninth level of Dao integration. However, apart from the half-step sovereign realm, Hong Xiu did not seem to have made much progress in her Dao enlightenment.Li Hao glanced at Hong Yitang, who was a little embarrassed.He had only chosen Hong Xiu because Li Hao was here and he had said that he could help.Now that he thought about it, Hong Xiu was still far from being a venerable sovereign.Just as he was about to say no, Li Hao looked at someone and said,"uncle li, do me a favor. Connect that person's Dao with the great Dao universe ..."Venerable the sword followed his words and looked at one of them. He raised his eyebrows slightly."This is ... Compassion?"He was slightly hesitant,"this Dao ... Has the meaning of Phantom Dao. Humans have a compassionate heart, and it has the feeling of the Dao of Crimson moon's desire. But in the Dao of desire, it is considered a kind Dao ...""It's slightly related to enlightenment ..."After saying this, he finally looked at Li Hao.""I can do it, but I have to connect the void path. This is Hong Yitang's wife, right? Is connecting to the void path ... Suitable?" Phantom path was controlled by Qian Wuliang.Li Hao nodded."I'm fine. That's it."Venerable the sword nodded and said no more. His understanding of the two universes might be deeper than the two Dao Masters.,m With him around, the difficulty was not high.At this moment, Qian Wuliang sent a message to him,"Lord Marquis, I want ... I want Chen Zhongtian to vindicate Dao!""What?"Li Hao was startled. He glanced at the father and son of the Chen family in the distance.Chen Zhongtian and Chen Yao were former leaders of the inspection Bureau. The Chen family had long since pledged their allegiance to Li Hao, and they were the leaders of one of the nine divisions. However, the father and son of the Chen family had always been tactful and knew that they were not as good as the Silver Moon martial masters who had always followed them.Chen Zhongtian, in his earlier years, was stronger than everyone else.However, he had always been inconspicuous and kept an extremely low profile.He didn't expect that Qian Wuliang had his eyes on him.He smiled and nodded. Chen Zhongtian was qualified to advance, but at this moment, he was not sure if he was deliberately hiding his strength and waiting for the next time, or if he was too weak to continue and did not succeed."You do it yourself, you're the master of the great Dao ... If you want to do me a favor, do it yourself!"Qian Wuliang felt a bit embarrassed but didn't say anything.He chose Chen Zhongtian because he and Chen Zhongtian were in similar situations. Chen Zhongtian was also a smart person. He was the master of the great Dao and was very lonely now. It was not bad to find a companion.Soon, Chen Zhongtian felt the attention of Dao. He looked at Qian Wuliang and then at Li Hao. Seeing that Li Hao didn't object, he was delighted.It's not bad that I can get a position!……Venerable sovereigns kept appearing.There were neo martial artists and also Silvermoon people.Li Hao didn't pay any more attention to what happened after that. He was mainly keeping an eye on his teacher ... But his teacher didn't make any moves, so Li Hao was slightly disappointed.Teacher, do you want to walk the five elements Dao?However ... It would be very difficult to combine the five elements into one.If he walked one path alone, he might be able to advance.Walking five paths was very difficult!Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, was very calm. Suddenly, he stopped cultivating and looked at Li Hao."Stop looking, I'm feeling the pressure! I've always been the one who strikes after the opponent strikes ... It's not the first time. Back then, the Silver Moon Warriors entered the thousand warrior tier earlier than me. I'm still the same. This time, I'm still using the five birds as one!""I want to establish my Dao domain first before vindicating my Dao ..."Li Hao was speechless. Dao domain was exclusive to Level Seven venerable sovereigns.He had established his Dao domain a long time ago and it was indeed related to domains. Kong Ji had also established his Dao domain a long time ago but he was still a middle-stage venerable sovereign.His teacher ... Was at the ninth level of Dao integration!You want to build a Dao domain before vindicating Dao?

This ... Really made him feel helpless."Teacher, it's difficult to build a Dao domain. You should advance to venerable sovereign first before building a Dao domain ...""No!"Yuan Shuo rejected him."I don't want to act according to their wishes ... Later on, help me find a world where the five elements are relatively balanced. I want to use the world as a Foundation to establish a Dao domain. I want to ... Become an itinerant cultivator! Wandering cultivators like the sword Saint and the others ...""Teacher!""Why? Are you looking down on me?""No..."Li Hao was helpless and could only say,"alright!" I'll find five small worlds for you, with the five elements in balance, and with the five regions as the foundation, merge the five DAOs, what do you think?""Yes, you're indeed my disciple. Your heart aches for your master!"“……”Li Hao smiled bitterly.The old man was really ... Very competitive.Since Yuan Shuo wasn't willing to ... He pondered for a moment. The slot that was originally reserved for his teacher ... Why not ... Give it to his teacher's wife who had yet to become his teacher's wife?Azure light sword!Sometimes, Li Hao would still play favorites. Hence, Li Hao did not try to hide it. Instead, he took the initiative to attack for the first time. He drew in a large amount of power of great DAOs, including some of his comprehensions of sword Dao, and sent them over. Azure lightsaber's expression changed slightly. He glanced at Yuan Shuo, and seeing that Yuan Shuo was no longer cultivating, he frowned slightly. Without saying anything, he began to cultivate in silence.Yuan Shuo couldn't vindicate Dao?Then ... I'll vindicate my Dao first!After becoming a venerable sovereign, he could at least give some guidance to old demon Yuan.“……”Li Hao, on the other hand, managed to get a glimpse of this idea. He felt a little helpless, but he didn't say anything. His teacher ... Was really embarrassing.……Venerable sovereigns 'Dao vindication caused a huge commotion.The others had also made some progress, but they were neglected by the large number of venerable sovereigns.Such a Grand occasion lasted for half a month.Half a month later, the group of people finally settled down.At this moment, Li Hao also spoke."The quota is full. We can't support everyone to become venerable sovereigns for now. We'll wait for some time to digest what we've gained. Only then can the next batch of venerable sovereigns be born!"Those who didn't vindicate Dao were disappointed but they didn't say anything.Looking around, Li Hao looked at the cultivators who were vindicating their Dao.Silver moon's Hong Yitang, Qian Wuliang, hou Xiaochen, director Zhao, sky sword, jade light sword, Hong Xiu, Chen Zhongtian, North fist, BA Dao, Yao si, South fist, light sword, Liu Long, Huang Yu, director Zhou, Kong Jie, Lin Hongyu, and black Panther were all venerable sovereigns.New martial arts 'Zhang an, the ninth Division commander, director Wang, Sequoia, turtle guard, li Fuhai, Huai general, heaven pole, and Huai King had also become venerable sovereigns.The outsider, Xun RUO, and Chan Xiu had also become venerable sovereigns. Half a neo-martial monster plant, the Imperial Guard little tree, had also become a venerable sovereign.Among the 32 venerable sovereigns, Zhang an and Lin Hongyu were not venerable sovereigns of the great path universe. Although Black Panther was a world Lord, he was also closely related to the great path universe. The two universes could accommodate 30 venerable sovereigns!There were a few old acquaintances who didn't advance.Wang Ming, Hao lianchuan, Liu Yan, Yu Luosha, Jin Jin, and the older generation's Mountain axe and Thunderbolt kick didn't advance. In fact, Li Hao felt that some of them could advance.However, in the end, the great path universe could no longer accommodate them. It trembled a little, and some people stopped cultivating.The younger generation, including Hong Qing, did not continue."Including me ... 33 venerable sovereigns!" He said.Li Hao sighed with emotion.33rd place!This didn't include venerable the sword and the others, nor did it include the giant pincers that didn't belong to the Silver Moon system. They were quite lucky, as it was very difficult for itinerant cultivators to become venerable sovereigns.However, he was different from Yuan Shuo. He didn't walk the path of Dao domain. He just purely strengthened one Dao and eventually took the opportunity to become a venerable sovereign.At this point, the first round of great improvement had officially ended.As for Hong Yitang, Qian Wuliang, hei Bao, King Huai, and Tian Ji, they had all entered the intermediate level. Although they were weaker than the average mid-level worlds, they were still considered as having the strength of a mid-level world.The number of venerable sovereigns might be higher. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "Congratulations, everyone!"Li Hao's voice was loud."This is only the first great improvement. When the two Dao Masters reach level five, more new venerable sovereigns will be born. When they reach level six, I, Silver Moon, can even accommodate a hundred venerable sovereigns!"Even if there weren't 100, it wouldn't be difficult to get 50 or 60.Li Hao laughed."That's why we don't have to worry about Silver Moon. Just focus on your cultivation and accumulation. Venerable sovereigns are only a matter of time!""Many thanks, Lord Marquis!" Everyone shouted in a low voice.At this moment, there was nothing else to say.This time, they had spent so many resources to produce a large number of venerable sovereigns, but they were all first level venerable sovereigns. To Li Hao, the gains did not make up for the losses, and it also put a lot of pressure on Silver Moon and the others.They had not been able to reach venerable sovereign level on their own. In the end, they had all been relying on Li Hao.This was truly a case of one man achieving Dao, and his chickens and dogs rising to the heavens.Many people looked at Yuan Shuo, feeling conflicted.Yuan Shuo ... Had actually failed to advance.It was really surprising!Li Hao didn't say anything. He just smiled. This time, he had paid off some of his debts. For example, li Fuhai and the others who had joined him were actually hoping to become venerable sovereigns in the future.This included the promises he made to the giant pincer ...Now, he could be considered to have realized it.Director Wang and the others, the first batch of old people that heaven battling city had met, had also advanced to the venerable sovereign level. In fact, there were a few Saints in neo martial, who were all strong people from other main cities, but this time, they didn't advance.

On the one hand, it was difficult to compete with Silver Moon, and on the other hand, it was not good to compete with him. It was better to be tactful and take the initiative to give up.There was still hope for the second batch.If the first batch were to fight for it, not only would they not succeed, but if they did, they might even cause dissatisfaction among the Silvermoon people.If Li Hao didn't provoke a level 7 or level 8 great world, he would be considered strong!However, when he thought about how he had offended Level Seven and level eight venerable sovereigns ... He decided to forget it.There were more than 30 venerable sovereigns, and a large number of them were level one venerable sovereigns. The difference between them and a great world was too great.At this moment, Li Hao couldn't hold on any longer. He looked at the crowd and laughed."Since I've succeeded, I'll have to cultivate by myself ..."The river appeared!The life and death Stars appeared.When the crowd saw this, some did not understand, while others understood something. It was a little complicated.It was a life and death battle!Li Hao couldn't hold on any longer.But before that, Li Hao said with a smile,""Before that, I still have to transcend the lightning tribulation ... I'll capture the primal Chaos lightning tribulation and see if I can create a world of destruction!""Senior Li Zhu," he said, looking at Li Zhu,"if I can't resist it, or even get struck by the lightning, please help me keep the power of the river hidden. This time, I can't use up too much of the river's power. Otherwise, I can't afford to feed myself.""Yes!"Li Zhu didn't say anything, and Li Hao gave up on concealing his aura. In an instant, dark clouds appeared and turned into tribulation lightning.The lightning tribulation transformed into a giant!Both sides could be considered old acquaintances. This time, the lightning tribulation appeared quickly and condensed quickly. Nine Giants even appeared at once. Each of them was extremely powerful. They were no longer following the usual routine.It was as if he had been completely enraged by Li Hao!The nine Thunder Giants were each stronger than the last, from the weakest at the 6th rank to the strongest at the 7th rank.He started fighting!Li Hao also raised his sword to kill!Tens of thousands of DAOs emerged, and the Dao net transformed into a domain. The Thunder giant and Li Hao began to fight. In the blink of an eye, his body began to shatter with a boom. Li Hao took advantage of this opportunity to roar and slash at a level six giant!Under the heavy gazes of the crowd, he killed a Type 6 lightning giant with a single slash!Li Hao quickly entered it and comprehended it. In the blink of an eye, he captured some power of lightning and destruction.In an instant, a weak little realm appeared in the river.Li Hao had captured a part of the power of the lightning, but before he could send it back, a level 7 giant exploded with a boom. In an instant, Li Hao was blown into pieces and disappeared!This time, although Li Hao had disappeared, the remaining lightning Giants went straight for the river, as if they had sensed Li Hao's aura in the river.Upon seeing this, Li Zhu quickly cast his Dao domain to cover the river!However, they were still charging in that direction!Li Zhu's expression changed slightly. He couldn't block it?As he was thinking, two cats suddenly appeared. They opened their mouths wide and swallowed the sky and earth, devouring the remaining Giants. At this moment, the dark clouds seemed to be gathering again. But this time, the daylight thief technique was effective.It covered everything in an instant!The dark clouds seemed to hesitate for a moment before dispersing.Lizhu's expression changed slightly, and venerable the sword and the others frowned. Kong Ji was even more uneasy."Haoyue has provoked the Thunderbolts too many times. This time, he has already fallen, and his aura has been extinguished, but the Thunderbolts still haven't dissipated, and are still chasing him to the end...If this continues, the next time, it might not just be the seventh-grade Thunderbolts that will kill him!"In the past, when Li Hao died, Thunderbolt would disperse.A new beginning, and the past shall not be forgotten!However, this time ... There was none. Everyone was solemn and didn't say anything. Kong Ji looked at second cat curiously. There were quite a few Thunder tribulation Giants left and this cat had eaten them all in one bite!This cat ... What kind of strength did it have?Li Zhu and the others looked at er Mao seriously but didn't say anything.Was this person also going to completely descend into the main world?In that case ... It was possible to replicate Emperor Cang?To reach the peak of the seventh step?Or could it be that it was slightly weaker and replicated the peak of the sixth rank, the limit of the neo martial in the past?It was hard to say!However, at this moment, this cat's strength might have reached the sixth rank!Most importantly, it could eat anything. This was also a characteristic that was extremely terrifying.Ermao didn't care about them. After eating the lightning, it went back into the river.Li Hao, on the other hand, was more familiar with the process than before. Soon, he emerged from the river, and his energy began to be consumed limitlessly. The remaining great Dao crystals were constantly shattered.Not only that, the power of great DAOs he had left behind after killing the two seventh level venerable sovereigns was also used to replenish his losses.​ Every time he died, his energy would be completely depleted, and he would need to consume a lot of resources.Li Hao didn't have many resources in his inventory. At this moment, he could only use the power of the seventh-level great DAOs as recovery resources.It was a waste, but he didn't care too much.If you have money, spend it!On this point, he agreed with the choice of the neo martial human King.This time, he was no longer an infant, nor did he lose his memories. In an instant, a young man appeared. He looked to be at least 11 or 12 years old.His memories were also almost completely preserved.Li Hao, on the other hand, was not happy. This also meant that the potential of his body might not be as strong as before after walking the life-death Dao for the fourth time.Of course, potential was potential. In the future, these things were important and not too important.A large amount of power of great DAOs was burned, and small realms quickly emerged, once again connecting with Li Hao.Very quickly, an elegant young man walked out of the river.Everyone looked at him. Venerable the sword and the others seemed to have noticed something. Venerable the sword frowned slightly and transmitted a message,""The life and death Dao is very useful, but ... Having the life and death Dao doesn't mean that I don't fear death!"Li Hao nodded and didn't say anything.He knew what to do.A level five venerable sovereign usually had a lifespan of 800000 years. He only had half of that lifespan now.400,000 years was a very long time.There was nothing to feel sorry for. Perhaps in the eyes of others, it was a pity, but Li Hao didn't think it was a big deal.It was enough!"Don't look at me anymore, brother Kong Ji. The migration is almost over ... We should destroy some of tianfang world while the others are still discussing how to deal with us ... It's best if you can enter Level 7. Even if you can 't, once you comprehend it and have enough energy, you can advance directly. We won't lose out this time!"Kong Ji didn't say anything more, but he was also eager to try. He laughed and said,"Alright!"The destruction of a tier 9 world was still very exciting!And in the depths of the universe, the shadow of the Dao chess appeared.The mysterious man had been observing them the whole time. When he heard their conversation, he prayed silently ..."Don't you two provoke anything scary."[Author's note: I'm in a daze. I've only been writing this book for less than 8 months. Why does it feel like a long time has passed since I wrote about the Silver Moon Martial Master? I thought about it for a long time and flipped through the previous chapters before I remembered these names.]

Chapter 3077 Quiet (1)
Tianfang world.There weren't many natives. In fact, they weren't natives either. They were all newcomers. Now, as some domain Lords evacuated, some people took away some of the residents. Those who didn't were arranged to enter a small world.They were all cultivators. Those who could enter tianfang from the chaos, whether they were born later or from the beginning, were all cultivators.The energy in a level nine world was too rich, and even babies born there were cultivators.A large number of people began to evacuate.A portion of tianfang world's venerable sovereigns chose to stay and prepare to join the forest orchid world. A portion of them had already migrated. With four rank seven venerable sovereigns overseeing tianfang, they did not dare to stay.Although he was very dissatisfied with these people occupying the heaven ... The heaven had no master, and it belonged to whoever was stronger.However, he was a little puzzled. The great Dao universe of tianfang had not recovered yet. What was the use of occupying tianfang now?……The people continued to migrate.A small world was directly expelled outside of Tian Fang and began to flow away from Tian Fang.Many cultivators were reluctant to leave.A level 9 world was much stronger than a small world like this, and the energy was much denser. Unfortunately ... He might never have the chance to return to the heaven's side again. At least the Silver Moon King was still considered human, and had given him a small world.If they didn't give it to him, apart from the venerable sovereigns, the rest of the people who entered the chaos could only wait for death.There were many venerable sovereigns in the small world.​ "Do you think they can open a Dao universe?" someone asked curiously."If it could be opened, do you think those seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns would not come?"Someone retorted.Those venerable sovereigns had all entered the great path universe before. They must have judged that it couldn't be opened in a short time. Otherwise, how could they leave so easily?Alright!Another venerable sovereign asked,"I'm a little curious. What's the relationship between this Silver Moon King and new martial?" A rank five venerable sovereign, and he actually joined forces with the Son of God of light to kill venerable sovereign Qi Shui ... Also, the one leading Tian Fang this time doesn't seem to be the new martial Swordmaster, but ... The Silver Moon King!"He was a little puzzled.Everyone's impression of Silver Moon was that it was just a subsidiary world of neo martial. In fact, before this, no one had paid much attention to it and had only regarded it as a subordinate of neo martial.However, this time, there were four rank-7s in Tian Fang.As for Tian Fang's side, the one in charge did not seem to be neo martial ... It was Silver Moon!This was very puzzling.A King of a subsidiary world could lead a rank seven venerable sovereign?New martial was considered Silver moon's world.It was not Li Hao's turn to make decisions.Not only that, the radiance Thearch's son also seemed to be under their command. This made people even more suspicious. There was also Wu Shan and the forest orchid realm Lord. These people were all overlords of their own territories and they had also gathered together.Furthermore, they were all guarding the realm gate.Four tier 7 experts! "I'm not too concerned about this. What I'm more concerned about is ... The birth of two level Seven neo martial venerable sovereigns, as well as the neo martial human King, Emperor Cang, and sun god. It's said that the Supreme neo martial artist has also stepped into Level Seven ... Neo martial is really different. It has actually given birth to six Level Seven powerhouses!"This was the key.No one knew the Silver Moon King's Secret.However, on the side of neo martial, a level Seven world could actually give birth to so many high-level venerable sovereigns. This was the key. Of course, two of them seemed to have advanced through the great path universe ... From this, it could be seen that these people were even more terrifying.He did not need a Dao universe and could actually step into Level Seven?"I'm afraid the chiyang region is going to be in chaos! It's said that neo martial world lacks Yang Qi and needs extreme Yang Qi to supplement it. The previous scorching sun World was only a level Seven world. I think a level eight world is more or less enough to supplement neo martial world's Foundation ... Right now, venerable sovereign Chi Yang might be having a headache. "Some venerable sovereigns were chatting, having nothing to do.Recently, the chaos had been in turmoil, and it was not peaceful.In a short period of time, a large number of venerable sovereigns had fallen, and many of them were advanced venerable sovereigns.……The venerable sovereigns were still chatting.Within tianfang world.As the miscellaneous people were driven away, the entire Tian Fang became Li Hao's territory.At this moment, the tianfang great Dao universe split open. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The world of the Silver Moon appeared.A world was placed directly in the tianfang boundary, suspended in the air like a city in the sky.Compared to Tian Fang, the Silver Moon was too small.Even after devouring countless worlds, it was still very small, far smaller than the sky. The Silver Moon, which was transforming into a rank five intermediate world, fell into the sky, but it didn't occupy the southern region.However, it was much bigger than the return Dragon field.The newly-advanced venerable sovereigns, Dao integration cultivators, sun and moon cultivators, as well as parts of the mountains and seas, were all flying around the Stargate. Some landed in the outsides, while others circled around the Silvermoon world to observe. It was as if they had discovered a new world.I've gained knowledge!So, the Silver Moon was only this big.So, it was like this outside the world.Before this, it was chaos outside, so they couldn't go out. Then, it was the tianfang great Dao universe, and the Stargate was closed, so they couldn't go out.It was only today that they had the chance to walk out of the Silver Moon.And such an opportunity was actually very rare.To be able to place a world in a Grade 9 world, if it was a normal day, where would one get such an opportunity?Furthermore, in a normal recovering world, there would be some rejection when it accommodated other worlds. Only Tian Fang was special. His great Dao had been destroyed, so there was no rejection force.At this time, many people came out.Li Hao gave everyone some time to look at the entire Tian Fang and compare it to the Tian Fang before and after its destruction. Such an opportunity and insight would be of great help to all cultivators on their future path.

Chapter 3078 Quiet (2)
……"This is Tian Fang?"At this moment, a group of young cultivators were walking in the sky.Liu Yin and a few of the new Silvermoon cultivators were rather curious and greedily absorbed Tian Fang's energy. Silvermoon's energy had almost been exhausted over the past five hundred years, and when they were born, Silvermoon was already a barren land.Even as the second generation, he didn't enjoy as many resources as he had imagined.During this period of time, the energy in the Silver Moon had become many times richer. However, a large number of venerable sovereigns had been consumed to advance, and the world was advancing. They were all absorbing energy crazily. In addition, hundreds of millions of cultivators were also absorbing energy crazily. They did not absorb much.Each and every one of them looked as if they had gone crazy from hunger.In the end, after entering tianfang, it was a level nine world after all. It automatically absorbed the power of Chaos and transformed it. Although the great Dao had not recovered, it did not lack basic energy.Otherwise, this place would not be able to support hundreds of venerable sovereigns.Even at this moment, it had much more energy than the Silver Moon. These guys who had never seen it were all speechless.How blissful!And this was a world after it was destroyed. It was said that the great Dao was gone. If the great Dao was still here, at its peak, wouldn't it be able to turn energy into rain?"Brother silver, it's said that Marchioness Silvermoon wants to destroy this world ... How big is this world?"How old?Liu Yin shook his head."I don't know. I've only heard that this world is divided into 40 small regions. We're currently in a small region, and this small region is enough for us to travel for seven to eight days ... Even if we go all out, it will still take a few months!"And this was still under the circumstances of going all out.Such a world was simply terrifyingly huge."Brother Yin, do you have any inside information?"A female cultivator beside him asked expectantly.The others also hurriedly listened. They were all second generation, and their fathers were some of the upper echelons left behind by Silver Moon. However, very few of the top echelons had established their own families.Liu Long and Liu Yan had long been together.The others, such as hou Xiaochen, lived in separate areas. They didn't have the chance to meet each other, and naturally didn't have the chance to give birth to any descendants.Therefore, even though the status of these second-generation heirs was not bad, they were still far from Liu Yin."Inside information?"Liu Yin laughed. He thought for a moment and said,""I don't know if this is considered inside information ... Actually, Marchioness Silvermoon has mentioned a few times before that she's going to destroy tianfang world this time!" Everyone nodded. We all know this.The key point!Liu Yin saw that they were looking forward to it, so he laughed and said,""I've never seen a world being destroyed before, and neither have my father and the others ... But it's said that during the process of destruction, the Dao accumulations in some places, which are places where middle and high-stage venerable sovereigns cultivate, will also shatter and emit venerable sovereign Dao accumulations! The Tian Fang great Dao universe has been destroyed. If fate allows it, I can comprehend the Dao accumulations of the Tian Fang great emperor now and perhaps inherit some of the Tian Fang great Dao!""If I can inherit the legacy of the Tian Fang Emperor ... Perhaps ... I can enter the Tian Fang universe!"This time, it wasn't the same as before.It was a transplant of a great Dao!"It's said that tianfang universe hasn't been revived yet. Only Marchioness Silvermoon can open it because the Marquis has inherited some of tianfang's orthodoxies. If anyone can inherit some, they can also activate some of the great Dao stars that have been destroyed in tianfang universe ..."Liu Yin said softly."The Silver Moon world is good, but it's only level four at the moment. This is a level nine world from the past. Once we can inherit some of Tian Fang's orthodoxies, we won't need to occupy the Silver Moon's spot to become a venerable sovereign. "Second, once tianfang universe completely recovers, as well as the recovery of a level 9 world, I don't need to say anything. Everyone knows what that means. It's an opportunity! What a great opportunity!""Of course, the risk is also very high!"The group of people around him were engrossed in listening and were suddenly startled. They all looked at him. Liu Yin's expression was slightly serious. "It's said that ... Even though the current Marquis has many friends who are all top-notch experts ... He also has many enemies!""A bunch of seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns ... They're terrifying! Tian Fang is a place that all powerhouses covet. Currently, the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns are only temporarily helping us protect Tian Fang. They will leave sooner or later. Although Silvermoon has many venerable sovereigns now, he can't protect Tian Fang!""At that time, tianfang universe would have been taken away. If anyone were to comprehend the tianfang Dao ... They would be in deep trouble." Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Everyone's heart moved. This was true."Brother silver, even four rank seven venerable sovereigns can't defend Tian Fang?""Nonsense! It was said that dozens of Level Seven and level eight venerable sovereigns had fought here and many of them had died! Later, our Lord Marquis relied on the means of Alliance and the assistance of neo martial to take down this place!"Liu Yin sighed and shook his head."Silver Moon is too young. According to the chaotic era, it has only been 50 years since venerable Swordmaster left. It's already unbelievable for a venerable sovereign to appear in such a Young World, let alone a bunch of them!""In short, there will definitely be opportunities in Tian Fang, but ... Opportunities also represent danger. Once Tian Fang is abandoned and Lord Marquis leaves with Silvermoon, it will be difficult to escape if someone enters the Tian Fang great Dao universe."So that was how it was! Everyone understood.But in his heart, he was still a little tempted.This was an opportunity!"What if we comprehend Tian Fang's great Dao and don't enter Tian Fang universe?""That's fine too!"This time, everyone was relieved. Someone said,""Where is the Taoist connotation? Are there many?"

Chapter 3079 Quiet (3)
"Many! It was said that there were hundreds of venerable sovereigns in tianfang world back then, and every domain had a place for Taoist connotation ..."He then continued,"however, I know of some places with Taoist connotation. In fact, there is no Taoist connotation in them. Some places with Taoist connotation are rich. Some are left by middle-stage venerable sovereigns, and many are left by high-stage venerable sovereigns. These are all confidential!"Everyone was overjoyed to hear this.As expected, he knew some inside information by following Liu Yin.Silver Moon did not spread this kind of news.Even if they knew about the existence of the Taoist connotation, there were so many Taoist connotations, and some of them had actually been destroyed. Do you know which one was useful and which one was useless?Which one was left behind by a rank seven venerable sovereign, and which one was left behind by a rank eight venerable sovereign?……At the same time.The news spread like wildfire. The Silver Moon Warriors who walked out received some news. In fact, Li Hao's team had intentionally released the news.Of course, it was hard to say how they would choose, how they would look for it, and whether the place of Taoist connotation they found was powerful or not.In addition, there was also danger.In a destructive world, the Taoist connotation would explode. The Taoist connotation left by an expert could also hurt the people nearby.Inside the Dao universe.A group of people gathered.Li Hao's plan was not so simple. At this moment, he looked at the two masters of great DAOs and said solemnly,""I hope that the Silver Moon can use Tian Fang's opportunity to ascend to the heavens in a single step in this world's destruction!""Silvermoon is too young ... Being young means that he has great potential, but it also means that his Foundation is very weak. Even if I release countless great DAOs into the great Dao universe, it's hard to make an extremely young great Dao universe comparable to an old world!"The experts nodded.Li Hao continued."My idea is ... The two Dao Masters can directly connect the river to all the Dao accumulations. When the world is destroyed, the Dao accumulations will explode. On the one hand, it's to protect the Silver Moon cultivators who are watching. On the other hand ... It's also to let the river of the great Dao absorb the comprehensions of these heavenly Emperor!"The two path Masters were overjoyed. Li Hao quickly said,""However, the problem now is that Tian Fang's venerable sovereigns 'remaining Dao accumulations are fine if they don't have any offensive power. Once they do ... There are still many of them, and it will be dangerous!"The few that he had come into contact with were not aggressive.It didn't mean that all of them were the same.Once his Dao accumulation exploded, two rank four Dao Masters might not be able to hold on."Lord Marquis," Qian Wuliang said seriously,"the venerable sovereigns have left these Taoist connotation for a long time. Can they hurt us if they explode?" Fourth stage venerable sovereign!"Ordinary ones won't work. Even Level Seven ones are a little difficult ... But I've entered the dark Demon Ridge before, a place with level eight Taoist connotation. Even level five venerable sovereigns were killed there."As soon as he said this, the two of them became a little serious.Li Hao continued,"as far as I know, tianfang has five elements. They have the light and dark messengers, who are all level eight venerable sovereigns. Among the five elements, the weakest one, water element, seems to be at the peak of level six ... The other four are said to be Level Seven. But the leader of the five elements, Jin element, may be level eight ... I don't know the details, nor do you. Moreover, it's hard to tell where the opponent's Taoist connotation is.""There's also the Lord of Tian Fang ... A stage 9 expert!"Li Hao sighed."So far, I've only found the chess piece that he left behind. It doesn't mean that it's his Taoist connotation or his place of cultivation. He specializes in space, so it's hard to find his place of cultivation normally. But once a world is destroyed, perhaps ... We'll find his palace or something. A world of destruction means the destruction of an entire world. Even a two-layer space will be revealed!""Anything can appear during Nirvana ... Even some hidden monarch weapons, including some powerful beings in deep sleep ..."p "A slumbering Almighty?"The two of them were stunned and looked at Li Hao. Was that possible?Tian Fang had disappeared for many years, even more than a million years. Logically speaking, after such a long time, other than high level venerable sovereigns, the rest might have died of old age. After all, fifth level venerable sovereigns could not live for a million years.A sixth-grade one was about the same.Grade 7 ones were almost undying.On Tian Fang's side, unless there was a tier 7 who had stayed behind all those years ago and had been hiding all along, even taking the initiative to destroy his own great Dao, otherwise ... How could there be a slumbering expert?"A clone!" Li Hao sighed.“……”Everyone was stunned."Even senior Empyrean pole was able to leave behind a clone. What if an expert like the master of empyrean heaven left behind a clone? They don't need to occupy the great Dao ...
