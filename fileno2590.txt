The Skylands world.It was so huge that it would take a venerable sovereign months to circle around it.Compared to chaos, it was not worth mentioning.However, to a world, it was unimaginably huge. In the Silvermoon world, before Li Hao advanced to venerable sovereign, he could instantly travel from south to north. In this world, venerable sovereigns needed a month to circle the world.One could only imagine how big it was.The heaven had no master!Many years ago, this place had no master. For some venerable sovereigns, the master of tianfang world was a legend. He had left tianfang world countless years ago ... Of course, there were also rumors that everyone in tianfang world had died.However, everyone felt that this was impossible. It was said that at the peak of tianfang world, the world Lord had entered the legendary stage of level nine venerable sovereign.As for the number of advanced venerable sovereigns, it was hard to count them with two hands.As for the weaker venerable sovereigns, there were countless of them. No one thought that this world would be destroyed, or that it would be destroyed without a sound. It was too terrifying and impossible.Ever since the master of tianfang left, this world had become the base camp of the chaos Rangers.From all directions, countless wandering Warriors from countless worlds gathered in the sky. After countless years, this place had become an extremely prosperous macro world. Almost every moment, there were foreign experts entering.There was a huge gate in each of the four directions of the huge world.p People came and went here ... Here, you would find that there were many people in the chaos, unlike what Li Hao had seen, where there was not even a shadow of them after a month.……In front of the huge door.Li Hao arrived. However, he was slightly different at the moment. An aura of destruction surrounded him.They were like dead spirits!It was necessary to keep a low profile and disguise when he was out.The zu an of the past might not have been a good person.Perhaps he was only trying to be a good person for once because he felt that he could not take down Silver Moon, but he could not stop the other party from harboring such thoughts. If he called a few of his good friends in tianfang world ... And was certain that Li Hao would come, it would be troublesome.Knowing that the tianfang world was right in front of him, Li Hao had no choice but to come here. He had to avoid such a crisis if he could.There was someone in front of the huge door.There was not only a person, but also a giant dragon.They seemed to be the guards of this place.Tian Fang had no master ... But that didn't mean it didn't have any power. Li Hao arrived with vigilance.In an instant, a powerful existence, but it was not a venerable sovereign, probably a Heavenly King expert, quickly soared into the sky. He was not arrogant. Those who could travel alone in the chaos were almost all venerable sovereigns.The newcomer was quite polite. When he saw Li Hao, he sent a mental message."Greetings, senior Overlord! Tianfang world, Huilong temple's giant pincers, tianfang South Gate left behind! May I ask senior, is this your first time in the tianfang world, or is it a regular?"Li Hao saw that the newcomer was quite polite, but he didn't seem to be human. He nodded slightly."First time here ...""Senior, do you need a guide? You probably don't know much about tianfang world. If you need, Hui long temple can provide you with a guide for free. Everything can be solved through the guide ... If you encounter any trouble, you can also ask for help from Hui long temple at any time ... The leader of Hui long temple, Hui long venerable sovereign, is a sixth level venerable sovereign, comparable to the Lords of some major worlds ..."Some great world Lords were only Grade 6, so this wasn't a lie.Li Hao was stunned.Sixth rank?I'll go!So strong?According to his own deduction, he could only reach the sixth rank if he walked to the limit of life and death, then walked the path of yin and yang. Only when he reached the limit of yin and yang could he possibly reach the sixth rank.Tier 6 was not to be trifled with.The red moon sovereign, who he had almost failed to kill after killing for half a day, was only at rank three.As he was thinking, the giant Pincher said,"senior, you don't have to worry about anything. If you think that I can stay in Huilong temple ... You can join me at any time. If you don't think that it's necessary ... You can make a good relationship with me and walk in the chaos. The chaos is unimaginably vast. If we meet in another place in the future, we can take care of it!"Li Hao was interested. He smiled and said,""You ... This is the territory of the Hui long temple?"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "Not all of them!"The giant Pincher did not hesitate and quickly said,""Tianfang world is an ownerless world. There are four boundary gates in the North, South, East, and West. There are countless forces of all sizes in tianfang world. Among them, four powerful forces have taken over the right to guard the four boundary gates!""The main purpose is to make friends with some experts and help each other so that everyone can live a better life in the chaos ..."The other party was also good with words. The four forces of the Huilong temple had paid a high price to take the position of gate guard, but it was all worth it. There were many venerable sovereigns in the chaos.However, it did not mean that they were all venerable sovereigns.There were also some Heavenly Kings who took the risk to come, even Saints ... Even if it was extremely dangerous, it didn't mean that they couldn't come. Some great world experts might also bring some juniors to travel the chaos.There were not many venerable sovereigns who were willing to stay and no longer be Rangers.The powers that were stationed in tianfang world all wanted to rope in some of them.No matter how great the price was, it was worth it. Any venerable sovereign was a treasure. It was extremely cost-effective for the various forces in tianfang to be able to rope in some of them by guarding the gate.As for the guide and other things, they were not worth mentioning to venerable sovereigns!

Chapter 2591 Tianfang World (1)
As for the entrance fee, he didn't need all of that, it was just a waste of money.These people were not guards. They had stayed here to make friends with the venerable sovereigns.Li Hao nodded slightly.I thought I'd collected a toll!So it was to make friends with strong people."I'm just a newly-advanced venerable sovereign, a first-stage venerable sovereign ..."He smiled.Before he could finish his sentence, the giant Pincher said in a hurry,""It's rare to see a venerable Emperor! How many venerable sovereigns could there be in the chaos? Even if a large world was extremely powerful, it could only accommodate a hundred venerable sovereigns! How many living beings were there in a major world? 100 billion? A trillion? One out of ten billion ... Senior, aren't you overestimating us by saying this?"Li Hao really laughed this time.I thought venerable sovereigns were worthless.In the end ... This force that had a rank six venerable sovereign also seemed very polite and not as arrogant as he had imagined.I thought I had to tuck my tail between my legs.There were a few people behind the pincers. There were humans and non-humans. Needless to say, the Dragon was a demon.At this moment, seeing Li Hao's expression, even the giant dragon slightly bowed to show respect.This was interesting!When he heard what zu an said earlier, he had thought that this place would be extremely chaotic and that a fight would break out at the slightest disagreement!He really didn't know much about Tian Fang.He and zu an chatted for a while, but it was said that zu an hadn't been here for many years, so he wasn't too sure.A guide ...It was not impossible since he was new.Li Hao didn't plan to do anything as soon as he arrived. There were many venerable sovereigns in this place, so he couldn't act recklessly."Then I'll have to trouble you. I need a guide ...""Senior, what do you think of me?""I'll lead the way for you, senior ..."The giant pincer said hurriedly.Li Hao was startled. You're not guarding the door anymore?The giant pincer understood Li Hao's thoughts and hurriedly explained,""We are here to wait for the venerable sovereign! There may be some places where venerable sovereigns travel in Tian Fang that are dangerous, but you can leave some small things to us to do!"It was meaningless to be too weak.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  If the venerable sovereign took a step away, you wouldn't even be able to catch up.If he delayed venerable sovereigns 'time, it would easily cause others to be unhappy. The Heavenly King level was just right. Although it seemed that he was only one step away from venerable sovereigns ... Many Heavenly Kings had never been able to become venerable sovereigns in their entire lives.If he was lucky, he would be able to receive some guidance and some benefits. Perhaps it was also an opportunity.Too weak, you can't even understand the Dao lectures of venerable sovereigns. Of course, such opportunities were rare.p Moreover, the person in front of him was only a first level venerable sovereign. In fact, the opportunity was not too great. However, a first level venerable sovereign was still a venerable sovereign.Hearing this, Li Hao pondered for a while, then nodded slightly.""That's fine, thank you for your trouble!""I don't dare!"The giant Pincher revealed a look of excitement and hurriedly said,""Venerable sovereigns, do you need to go around tianfang and take a look at tianfang world when you first come here? There are 90000 Primal Chaos runes surrounding the primal Chaos in tianfang world. Senior, you will need about a month to circle this place. To us, it would take more than three months to make one round!"He continued,"tianfang world is extremely huge. There are also some Dao marks left in the surrounding regional walls. It is said that there are even marks left by a level nine venerable sovereign ... However, we have eyes but are unable to recognize them. If venerable sovereigns can circle around it, we might be able to gain something.""No need!"Li Hao shook his head. It was boring.It was inevitable that a group of venerable sovereigns had surrounded him. If there were any benefits, they would have already belonged to others. How could it be his turn?It was just a delay!"Let's go in and take a look!""Alright!"The giant pincer didn't say anything and quickly led the way. The Heavenly Kings on both sides respectfully made way and watched as the giant pincer led Li Hao into tianfang world.Very quickly, someone sent a message back to tianfang world.Any venerable sovereigns who arrived had to be careful. For the local forces, even if these venerable sovereigns didn't join them, they'd better not join other forces. Of course, it would be best if they just came to take a look and left, so as not to cause trouble.……He stepped into the regional wall.As if teleporting, Li Hao's heart twitched. Heaven and earth rotated, and there was a sense of spatial teleportation. It could accommodate the teleportation of venerable sovereigns, and there were not many abnormalities. This realm gate teleportation array was not bad.He had thought that he would appear in a city, but it turned out to be a small town.There were no experts here, only a few Heavenly Kings and Saints. When they saw the giant pincers and Li Hao, they knew that a venerable sovereign had arrived.One of the Heavenly Kings who stayed behind quickly said,""If senior wants to leave Tian Fang, you can also come here. You don't need any token and can directly teleport away! However ... I need to remind you that it took a lot of effort to build this teleportation formation. If you are pursued by a strong enemy, you can't destroy the teleportation formation. Otherwise, you will invite the revenge of the Dragon returning temple!""That's right!" The Heavenly King's expression was also grave."Tian Fang is rather chaotic. As long as senior doesn't destroy the teleportation formation, no one will interfere even if we fight here!"In short, you can fight, but you can't cause any destruction.Otherwise, even a sixth stage venerable sovereign was not to be trifled with!Li Hao nodded and didn't say much. At this moment, he was already somewhat absent-minded. He looked around. The energy here was so dense that it was simply ... Unimaginable!Such dense energy!He sensed that the great Dao was a little messy, different from Silver Moon 's.The Dao here seemed to be extremely chaotic, and there was even a lot of primal Qi mixed in. However, there was no such thing in Silver Moon. Only when desolate beasts invaded would there be some primal Qi, and ... It didn't feel as dense.

Chapter 2592 Tianfang Grand World (3)
The world was so big that he couldn't even sense everything.What a big world!Such dense energy!One day of cultivation here could even be compared to 10 or 100 days of cultivation in the Silver Moon!Was this the great world?And it was a great world without a great Dao!It was no wonder that this place had attracted so many people, including some great world experts and many experts who had brought their families here. Even if there was no great path universe in this place, one could cultivate much faster than ordinary small and medium-sized worlds.It was a good place!If he could devour this world, Silver Moon would be able to advance to a great world, right? This thought flashed through his mind.Li Hao was secretly speechless. How could he think that?How many experts were there in this place?It was said that there were several sixth stage venerable sovereigns, so wouldn't there be more than a hundred of those below the sixth stage, including Rangers?It shouldn't be weaker than an ordinary macro world. Otherwise, it would have been taken by a macro world. Other macro worlds didn't dare to take it, and they couldn 't, but he had such a thought. It was terrible!Li Hao, you can't let your thoughts run wild!The Silver Moon world is the Li family 's, and the Li family's is mine, so there's no problem.This world does not belong to me, nor does it belong to Silver Moon.Of course, there was nothing wrong with thinking about it ... After a casual investigation, Li Hao was left speechless. There was actually a large energy mine underground. Although Silver Moon had advanced to a medium-level world, it had only been a short time. As of now, he did not even have a real mine!He was really rich!Although a mine vein was nothing to a venerable sovereign like him, if he could get a thousand of them, Silver Moon could also become a Holy Land for cultivation!This was just a small town!Looking at the population ... It was very small, maybe just over a thousand people.He didn't know if they were outsiders or residents of the local forces.At this moment, countless thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind. Like a country bumpkin, he felt that everything he saw was good and valuable. Li Hao was more interested in things that even the Heavenly Kings did not care about.He was really rich!How extravagant!The smithing on the ground was all treasures.This place was really a good place.If other people saw this, they would probably drool. The neo martial King probably had not been here before, and even if he had, he didn't know if he would have ransacked this place! Of course, he was like this when he was weak. Now that he was strong and had a higher vision, perhaps he would not mind?"I'm a gentleman ... I can't learn from the neo martial arts human King!"Li Hao secretly warned himself not to let his imagination run wild.At this moment, Li Hao finally came back to his senses and looked at the giant Pincher that was waiting in front of him. Seeing Li Hao looking at it, the giant Pincher woke up and smiled. It was no longer surprised by this."Senior, this is tianfang world, the southern region, the Huilong region!""Tianfang world is divided into four large domains. Each domain has many small domains, like a world! In the southern region, the Huilong region has the largest territory and the largest population. Apart from the Huilong region, there are nine other regions in the South, and the Lord of each region is at least a fourth level venerable sovereign!""The entire South is divided into ten small regions ... It's not that there can't be more, but the current division is the most reasonable. If the other venerable sovereigns want to take root here, they either have to destroy a region or pledge allegiance to another region ..."  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao nodded."It seems that there are many venerable sovereigns in tianfang world. Besides the trading place where chaos wanders and the cultivation energy is denser, there is no great Dao universe. Why are there so many venerable sovereigns gathered here?""If a level six venerable sovereign is willing to nurture a medium-sized world, there is still hope for it to advance to a great world. Once it becomes a great world, it may be able to open its own great path universe and have a chance to advance to Level Seven. But here ... There's not much hope, right?"This was also what he was puzzled about.Forget about the others, not even the chaos Ranger, but what was the use of these sixth-stage venerable sovereigns staying here?There was no great Dao universe!Instead of staying here, he might as well cultivate a medium-sized world, where there was still hope for him to advance to the seventh step.There was almost no hope here.The giant pincer was stunned for a moment before it said awkwardly,""This ... Senior is right. However, rank seven venerable sovereigns ... Can only be encountered and not sought! It's ... It's as difficult as ascending to the heavens for a medium-level world to become a great world!"At this moment, he was certain that the person in front of him was a newly-advanced venerable sovereign.What a joke!Some major cosmos absolute beings were only at the sixth rank.Seventh level venerable sovereign, do you think anyone can reach that level?Even if one had a Dao universe, it did not mean that one could advance to the seventh level. Moreover, a Dao universe did not appear as one wished. One needed to have a deep understanding of Dao techniques!Only then would there be hope of triggering the great Dao universe to descend, open it up, and nurture it ... In short, this was an extremely difficult thing.In any large world, the birth of a great path universe was due to some peerless existences who had a sense of enlightenment. In fact, it had little to do with where they were. It did not mean that one had to stay in one place to be able to give birth to a great path universe in a medium world and advance to a large world.Hearing this, Li Hao knew that he had been a little impetuous.He chuckled,"I'm a newcomer, so I don't know much about these things ... Don't blame me if I'm wrong!" By the way, is there any place or opportunity in tianfang world that can help venerable sovereigns advance in their cultivation?"The giant pincer heaved a sigh of relief. It was afraid that the other party would continue to spout nonsense."There are!""Tianfang world is not a small place," the giant pincer quickly said."It used to be a ninth-rank venerable sovereign. It was the only ninth-rank venerable sovereign in the surrounding hundreds of millions of Primal Chaos rulers ..."

Chapter 2593 Tianfang Grand World
Li Hao calculated for a moment. Each time he teleported, one Primal Chaos iron ruler would only have the range of 100 million teleports.Moving a few hundred times a day was no problem.How many days would it take?That's ... About 1000 years?Of course, I'm only a first level venerable sovereign now. The stronger I get, the faster I'll be. When I reach that level, I won't need so much time."Although this world has been abandoned with the departure of the master of Tian Fang, there were many high-level venerable sovereigns in the past, so there are still many places for Taoist connotation!""After so many years, some venerable sovereigns have gained something!""When I return to the Dragon field, I'll have a few Taoist connotation!"After saying that, the giant pincer continued,'there are three most famous places with Taoist connotation in the Dragon field! Venerable sovereign, you can go and take a look, but ... As time passes, your Taoist connotation is not enough, so you may not gain much!""Also, back in the Dragon field ... Or in the entire tianfang world, all the Taoist connotation places, there might be some conflicts ..."He still reminded Li Hao. Li Hao was puzzled.""We can all watch it. Why did a conflict break out? Is it not allowed by the Dragon Temple or is there some restriction?""That's not it!"The giant Pincher hesitated for a moment before explaining,""This isn't a secret! I'm not a venerable sovereign, so I don't know the specific situation, but it's rumored that the blood of a venerable sovereign and the Dao of a venerable sovereign can stimulate the Taoist connotation ... As a result, a large number of venerable sovereigns often gather in the Taoist connotation!""Some venerable sovereigns ... Will deliberately find fault and cause conflicts, which will lead to chaos. These venerable sovereigns are usually stronger!"In other words, you're weaker, so it's best if you don't join in the fun.It was a little dangerous!Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. The place of Taoist connotation, the blood of venerable sovereigns activating the Taoist connotation ...This was interesting!It was no wonder that so many people went there. If there was really a high-level venerable sovereign's Taoist connotation that was more suitable for one, it would be very helpful to feel the rhythm of the great Dao of a top expert."Have any venerable sovereigns fallen?"Li Hao asked, and the giant pincer nodded slightly.""There are!" Li Hao's heart moved. That would indeed be dangerous.Even venerable sovereigns died here!From the looks of it, it should be real. Otherwise, it would be impossible for bloody conflicts to continue for so many years.Seeing that Li Hao seemed to be tempted, the giant pincer hurriedly said,""Senior, when I returned to the Dragon field, besides these three open Taoist connotation, the Huilong temple also preserved one Taoist connotation, which was preserved at the cost of the Abbey Dean! If senior is willing to join my Dragon returning temple, you don't need to shed any blood. As long as you guard the temple for a thousand years, you can visit it at any time ... Of course, you have to pay some venerable sovereign's blood essence for each visit, and it's free once every hundred years ... At other times, you'll have to pay the price yourself. "Li Hao smiled.At this moment, he was walking around aimlessly and did not have a fixed direction. He checked around and said while walking,""Hui long temple is very powerful, right? It was so powerful that unless the great world attacked, it should not be in any danger, right? Why do you still want to recruit venerable sovereigns?"The giant pincer explained,"first, the other three major forces of the tianfang world would sometimes have some conflicts with us. For example, the fight for the Dao accumulation land. For example, some ancient treasures might be spread. There might be some conflicts.""Secondly, chaos is wandering. Sometimes ... Sometimes, it will attack tianfang world without any care. We need to defend together!""Third, intimidate the great worlds!"He didn't hide anything."Tianfang world isn't without great worlds 'intentions. Especially for some newly-advanced great worlds, their realm Lords might be at the peak of level six and have yet to advance to Level Seven. They're particularly interested in tianfang world and often want to snatch it. They hope to take tianfang world. As a result, all parties need to work together to deter or even destroy it!""The fourth ..."This time, he sized up Li Hao and said meaningfully,""Even if there isn't such danger, cultivation requires luck. Sometimes, tianfang world will organize a battle to suppress the chaos!""Chaos?""Chaos?" Li Hao looked at him."What are chaos?"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The giant pincer said softly,"it's ... An existence that creates chaos!" Even the Redmoon region in the South, the Redmoon region and the yin-yang world, were all considered chaos in tianfang world! These great worlds would often take the initiative to start wars and annihilate worlds! Devouring the world for one's own use, chaos would be in chaos! Thus, there are certain organizations in the primordial chaos that specialize in killing these organizations!""Of course, since these worlds dared to create chaos, they are extremely powerful ... Therefore, we need to work together to destroy them!"Li Hao took a deep breath and said,"it can't be, right?" This crazy? I do know about the Crimson Moon world and the yin-yang world. I'm from there. It's too chaotic there. I heard that a war broke out and destroyed the two worlds. Would the Dragon return temple dare to annihilate them?""Of course not when we return to the Dragon Temple!" The giant pincer replied. However, if the Masters of the surrounding large worlds joined forces, tianfang field would also participate ... Of course, such a situation had not occurred yet. The red moon field and Yin Yang field were too strong. However, this is also information that everyone knows. If it's possible ... We'll still take action to destroy it!""You ... Aren't you afraid that both sides will find trouble with you?"

Chapter 2594 Tianfang World (1)
Li Hao looked at him in confusion.Returning to the Dragon Temple, he's really bold!They had seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns and were extremely powerful. They had even destroyed the great world, and they dared to recruit people with this condition ... They were really crazy!The giant pincer sighed,'it's not that we're not afraid, it's that they're not! The chaos that they created and the constant attacks on the various worlds would trigger the chaos alliance sooner or later! It's very common to see chaosverses like this. The primordial chaos gives birth to worlds, and the existence of worlds is the foundation upon which experts are born. If they so wantonly devour and attack worlds, they'll cause some major powers to be displeased!""He can deal with seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns?""Of course we can 't!"The giant pincer hurriedly smiled."I'm saying that if other experts are willing to help, Tian Fang will probably become the bridgehead. We're too close to the Crimson Moon region."Li Hao nodded slightly and didn't say anything else.Big brother did not say anything about second brother, but the other side said that this side was chaotic, and this side said that the other side was chaotic ... In fact, neither of them was a good person, including neo martial ... Fine, Silver Moon was actually not a good person either.Outside of the world, no one was willing to submit to anyone, and everyone wanted to do each other.Also, there were many level six venerable sovereigns gathered here ... Li Hao felt that there was a high chance that these guys still wanted to obtain some opportunities, such as the one from the master of tianfang.Otherwise, what was the point of a sixth-rank beast staying here? there was a high probability that it was for this.The so-called other things were just excuses.Are there any other rules in this tianfang world?""No, as long as you don't attack the territory of the domain leaves...No one will care even if you start a war in a region city. However, try not to do so. If too many weak people are involved, some of whom were brought by the domain leaves...It's easy to cause some conflict! As long as it doesn't involve anyone else, no one will care even if a venerable sovereign falls. "He then added,"in addition, the Taoist connotation is usually the location of a market!" Seniors can also exchange for some treasures for juniors. Treasures are hard to find for venerable sovereigns, but there are still some treasures that can be used for those below venerable sovereigns!""Among them ... For example, small worlds are also important treasures for trading!"He glanced at Li Hao and said in a low voice,""A small world is not bad, but for some venerable sovereigns ... After they advance to venerable sovereign, they won't be of much use. If I take it out and Exchange it for treasures, I might be able to exchange it for some top-notch treasures!"Li Hao raised his eyebrows.At this moment, he suddenly felt something strange. It was a feeling of ... Ruthlessness."A small world ... You can't take the creatures there with you, right?""This ... You can naturally take it away if you want to. However, there are many people in the small world, and I don't have any suitable treasures to carry with me ..."In other words, why would you take it away?To where?It was better to stay and avoid trouble. Once it was traded, it would either be devoured or refined into a treasure. In any case, whether the people inside lived or died depended on luck."Of course, this is all voluntary!" The giant pincer quickly added. Devouring a world is actually not allowed, but if the world Lord is willing to trade ... It's still possible!"Take off your pants, bullshit!They said that neo martial and the Crimson Moon devoured the world and were chaotic.,m In fact, it was all the same!How good is your trading world?Li Hao was also speechless.Indeed, one couldn't judge a book by its cover. The experts of tianfang world were a bunch of bandits.From what he said ... Sometimes, he would go out and do something!Anyway, it would be fine as long as no one found out.Li Hao wasn't interested in these things. He only asked,""Is there a place to exchange DAOs? Whether it's the DAOs of the great Dao universe, some of the disorderly great DAOs of the small world, or the Dao of chaos ... Are there any people who exchange DAOs?"The giant pincers were stunned.This time, he was really stunned."Yes!" He said after a long while."Did I?"Li Hao's interest was piqued, but the giant pincers quickly poured cold water on him."Senior, the world is different, and the great DAOs are different. Even if it's the same fire-type Dao, it's actually not the same. It might not be a system! There is usually not much to gain from communicating with each other. It will also waste time and allow the enemy to figure out their background. Therefore, very few powerhouses are willing to exchange mantras. "  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao frowned and asked,"why?" How could one improve without exchanging great DAOs? Even if the great Dao was different, one could draw parallels from it. Only after seeing more could one hope to master it. There are so many powerhouses, surely they won't all be so short-sighted?""It's not that there's no one to communicate with ... It's just that after many exchanges, the great Dao of the person who exchanges with us will leak out, including some of their weaknesses. As a result, many people don't dare to communicate with us anymore! As a new venerable sovereign, you may be enthusiastic, but as a guide, I have to remind you that some people deliberately deceive others in the name of communication. As soon as you leave Tian Fang, you may be followed, or even ... Killed!"Li Hao slightly frowned.This was an outcome he was not willing to see.There was only hope for further improvement when one had more exchanges and knowledge about the great Dao. For Li Hao, the new martial arts 'Dao of origin and the red moon's Dao of desire were actually an improvement in his level and vision.These were just two worlds. If he could interact more with them, it would be of great help to him in comprehending the Dao of time and perfecting the time great Dao.However, from what this person said ... Because everyone was afraid, they didn't dare to communicate now.It was really ... Chaos made people selfish!

Chapter 2595 Tianfang Grand World
He didn't say anything more and said,""Let's find a place with Taoist connotation and take a look. ""Senior ..."The giant pincer reminded him again,'senior, since you're a newly-advanced venerable sovereign ... Even if you go, try ... Try to avoid some experts! Those places usually had rank three venerable sovereigns! And the new venerable sovereigns are also the ones they like to provoke the most!"It doesn't matter if I hurt you or kill you. It's good for these people to revive their Taoist connotation and comprehend some high-level venerable sovereign Taoist connotation.I'm not looking for trouble for no reason, but I'm looking for trouble on purpose!Not for any other reason, but for profit.All the venerable sovereigns who went knew about the situation, but they still wanted to go. Giant pincer had actually seen it a few times. He had even brought one of them there personally, but he was quickly injured.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "Only rank three?"Li Hao was puzzled.The giant pincer was stunned for a moment before it chuckled helplessly."At the fourth rank, these open Taoist connotation places are not very useful! Moreover, a fourth rank venerable sovereign ... Even if you go to the place of Taoist connotation preserved by the Hui long temple, you don't need to join, and you'll have a free opportunity to observe it. It's also a small gift that I've prepared for a fourth rank venerable sovereign!"At that level, did he still need these?Fourth rank, do you think that's a lot?Grade 4 could even conquer a region in tianfang world and become the boss!Tier 4, placed outside, should be able to control a medium-sized world.Strictly speaking, the fourth rank and the sixth rank were still at the same stage. When he returned to the Dragon Temple, he would be accompanied by at least a venerable sovereign, not a Heavenly King like him."Senior," he said,"I'll take you to the Coiling Dragon Well first!""The Coiling Dragon's Well is said to be the place where a seventh level venerable sovereign cultivated in the past. He mainly cultivated the Dao of the flesh, Qi, and blood, which is also the great Dao that many venerable sovereigns cultivate! They're generally present in every world, but the details might be different. ""It's just that time is merciless and time flies by. Nowadays, Taoist connotation is rarely seen!""There are fewer venerable sovereigns there. Most of them are at level one or two, and only a few are at level three. They've all gone to the other two places. Moreover, this is only the return Dragon field. Some of them have already left the return Dragon field ..."Li Hao nodded.He had to admit that it was much more comfortable to have someone to guide him. He knew everything and didn't need to find out himself.Most of them were at the first or second rank ... Even if there were some conflicts, he was not afraid of anything.Even if there was a third stage venerable sovereign ... The current Li Hao might not be a match for him, but it would not be easy for him to kill him.Venerable Emperor of life and death still had some strength.Moreover, the Dao of time had only dispersed, not disappeared. It's not like I can't gather them at the critical moment!However, there would be big trouble then.The chaos lightning tribulation might descend again, which was not what Li Hao wanted to see. He had to keep a low profile. As a newcomer, peace was the best way to make money!……At the same time.Tianfang world.Back to the Dragon field.In a huge Hall, several venerable sovereigns were gathered and chatting.Someone said,"over at the red moon region, the yin-yang world has made its move. The moment it made its move, the Elysium and darkness great worlds were destroyed!" Yueming, tianlan, and the other major worlds are all gathering at the Crimson Moon world. They might join forces to deal with the yin-yang world ... This is a rare battle in the surrounding regions!""There are many advanced venerable sovereigns among them!""There are ... Quite a few great Dao universes!""If I return to the Dragon Temple and seize the opportunity to seize a great path universe, the temple master will definitely have a chance to reach Level Seven ..."“……”Above the crowd, a Daoist did not say anything.Someone below said,"he's not to be trifled with!" There were many experts participating in the chaos in the Redmoon region this time. There were also many high level venerable sovereigns. The yin-yang world and the Redmoon world were not weak great worlds. The yin-yang world had at least three seventh level venerable sovereigns! As for the Crimson Moon world, if the master of the Crimson Moon is a rank eight, then there will be one rank eight and four rank seven venerable sovereigns ...""In addition to the great worlds like tianlan ... There might be more than ten advanced venerable sovereigns in the battle ..."Pulling chestnuts from the fire was not that simple.After a long time, the Abbey Dean said slowly,"let's wait and see!" The two sides haven't officially started a war yet. Besides ... The tianfang world hasn't reached an agreement yet. The Lords of the surrounding worlds haven't decided to attack ..."If he were to participate now, he would be courting death.However, he could make some preparations. After all, the surrounding macro worlds would get involved sooner or later. Otherwise, if one side won and annexed the other side, it would be really troublesome when they became so powerful that they could not be restricted.Be it Red Moon or Yin Yang, they were not easy to deal with. They were very aggressive!"In the near future, I'll have to rope in more venerable sovereigns to join my Huilong temple!" The Daoist said slowly,"right now, the red moon and the tianfang region are not very stable. One more venerable sovereign means one more chance!" The surrounding chaos also caused a lot of chaos to wander around and enter tianfang world. This was a rare opportunity! "Several venerable sovereigns have come these days ... I'm going back to the Dragon Temple. According to tianfang's Southern realm gate, the Hongyue region is to the South. Recently, many strong cultivators have come from there, all of whom are seeking refuge ... This is a good thing and an opportunity for me to return to the Dragon Temple! Now, there's a fifth-stage venerable sovereign and several second and third-stage venerable sovereigns in the dark World and the Elysian world respectively. They're in the southern tianfang region. If we can rope them in, the Huilong temple's strength will increase by three times!""Will it cause dissatisfaction in the yin and yang field?" someone asked hesitantly.

Chapter 2596 Tianfang World (1)
Hui long temple's master smiled."That new martial human King has been wandering around the red moon region for decades and has never taken a step past the red moon. He's been circling around. It's been many years since we've seen a high-level venerable sovereign in the Outlander world. How could he come here so easily? besides ... Even if he did come, as an outsider, there are many low-level venerable sovereigns in the Outlander world. If he really dares to cause trouble, the Lords of the surrounding macro worlds won't sit by and watch!"Besides, the other party was still at war with the Crimson Moon, so they didn't have the time to care about this.He couldn't afford to offend that person, but that didn't mean that person could do as he pleased.Everyone nodded again. That was true.Moreover, two fifth level venerable sovereigns ... Were indeed tempting. Once they joined the returning Dragon Temple, it would be an opportunity for the temple!It was said that the bed universe of the dark great world had been destroyed, but the bed universe of the bliss great world was still there. As the venerable sovereign of the bed universe, he could still take it back if he had the chance.Even if he couldn 't, for example, the level five venerable sovereign in the dark World had mastered a lot of the power of the great path universe. If he was lucky, he might even have the hope of restoring the great path universe again, provided that he had the ability.At that time, he would have obtained a great Dao universe for nothing.Even if they were weak in the early stages, with the Dao universe, they would have a chance.Speaking of this, monastery master Hui long continued,""By the way, those venerable sovereigns from the South ... We should also check their background, in case they are spies sent by Yin Yang or the red moon! The new martial human King is not in the mood to come, but there are many venerable sovereigns in the new martial world wandering in the chaos, and the red moon is no exception. Tian Fang is not far from the red moon region, so be a little more vigilant!""Understood!"Everyone nodded in agreement.In the end, monastery master Hui long said,"recently, the venerable sovereign's blood in the Taoist connotation is not enough ... I'll find a chance to get some back!" Be careful, don't give others a handle! Find some weaker lone travelers ... Plant some people in the other Taoist connotation and stir up the situation. It's best to let them make a fuss on their own ... Create some dangers for them and let them understand that they can't wander in the chaos without a powerful force behind them!"  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  p "It's a small matter. We've already made arrangements.""That's good!"The Daoist smiled,'chaos is also showing signs of chaos ... It'll be difficult to stabilize the chaos if one doesn't reach Level Seven! I don't know when the opportunity will appear in tianfang. If I can reach Level Seven ... And control tianfang, my Dragon Temple will become the Lord of a large world, no weaker than any Senior Large world!"Everyone was looking forward to it, but they didn't say anything. It was too difficult!Tian Fang had been standing here for many years, and many major cosmos absolute beings had actually come, but they had all found nothing. Who knew if the legend was true?Perhaps, there was no such great opportunity here.At this moment, everyone was both expectant and regretful. It was a pity that they couldn't obtain a universe of the great path. Otherwise, if the Abbey Dean had advanced to Level Seven and defended the great world, the Huilong temple wouldn't have to do this, allowing venerable sovereigns to come and go as they pleased.The Daoist did not say anything else.Opportunities were hard to come by, and seventh rank venerable sovereigns ... He was also extremely eager to have them. However, the chaos was boundless, how many seventh rank venerable sovereigns were there?Which great world didn't go through countless trials and tribulations to give birth to a seventh rank venerable sovereign?On the other hand, it was said that the neo martial yin-yang world had only gone through three generations, a mere hundred thousand years, and there was actually more than one level Seven ... He was really envious!It was said that the new martial human King was extremely reckless and did not know any Dao Arts at all. Emperor Cang ate and slept, slept and ate, and even then he could reach the seventh rank. Even chaos had no eyes!He was envious and jealous of them, but he did not dare to provoke them.However, the neo martial human King was too arrogant, and the yin-yang world was a bit special ... Sooner or later, he would attract trouble. He didn't know if he could gain some benefits from this change.The destruction of bliss and darkness would definitely lead to some chaos.Countless thoughts appeared in his mind. He seemed to have thought of something and suddenly said,"By the way, the yin-yang world seems to have lost an unranked small world. In the past, the sword Master of yin-yang was in charge, but he was attacked by Hongyue and was thrown into the chaos ... The yin-yang world has also been searched for, but it has not been found. Hongyue is also looking for it. If there is a chance, you can ask around!"Everyone's heart was slightly moved as well, and they all nodded.The subsidiary worlds of the macro world were not domesticated, but born directly from the inside of the macro world. They were born from the loss of energy. Maybe ... He could even comprehend some of the origin of the great Dao of yin and yang.However, new martial and red Moon couldn't be found. Whether they could find it or not depended on luck.

Chapter 2597 Fearless (1)
Tianfang world.Back to the Coiling Dragon Well in the Dragon field.The so-called Coiling Dragon Well was not actually a well, but a concave Hill that looked like the mouth of a well.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Originally, there might have been some buildings.However, the master of Tian Fang and the others had disappeared for countless years. Now, not to mention buildings, even a place with an open Taoist connotation like the Coiling Dragon Well was completely gone. If it weren't for the fact that there was some Taoist connotation left here and some soil, it would be really inconvenient to move it away ... Even the soil had been dug up!There was no such thing as sustainable development in the chaosverse.It was like drying the pond to catch fish.When there were benefits, they all swarmed to snatch them. Who knew if they would come back in the future?However, outside the yellow pit, there were some buildings of all kinds and styles that came from different worlds. These were all built by people who came later and not from the original tianfang world.The things that were originally left behind in tianfang world were almost all gone.Li Hao was obviously too late.Sometimes, it was like this. If you were late ... You wouldn't get a share.This place covered a large area. There were many buildings and people around, but not all of them were venerable sovereigns.Some of the natives of tianfang world weren't originally tianfang people. They were people who had come after and lived here for countless years. There were also some Wanderers from the destruction of the world and young people who were brought here by some large forces to travel.​ In short, there were quite a few people in this place.Among them, there were a few venerable sovereigns who were wandering on the streets in the outer area. They were dreaming if they thought they could find some hidden treasures with their own abilities.Although the chaos was huge and there were many good things, there were many experts. It was almost like a dream for these venerable sovereigns to pick up the leftovers."Senior, this is the Coiling Dragon Well!"At this moment, the pincers were pointing at a depression in the Loess area in front of them. It occupied a large area, no smaller than a province. Even Li Hao was secretly shocked.The great world ... Was indeed extraordinary!It was just a relic, yet it occupied such a huge territory. Back then, this venerable sovereign might have occupied an even larger territory ... Of course, for a high-level venerable sovereign, it was normal for him to be able to dominate a large world.It was said that the owner of this place was originally an advanced venerable sovereign.Li Hao knew a little about Qi, blood, and the body. In neo martial, the blood Emperor and the human King also cultivated this Dao. However, just because they cultivated it didn't mean that they cultivated it alone. They might also cultivate many other DAOs."Senior, there are a few small markets around ... If senior is interested, you can take a look. You can use items to trade or Dao energy to do so. " "Dao energy?"Li Hao was puzzled."It's actually a great Dao crystal," the giant pincer explained."It's a great Dao crystal formed by venerable sovereigns breathing in and out chaos aura and purifying it! Only venerable sovereigns could breathe in and out the aura of Primal Chaos, and those who could walk in the primal Chaos were also venerable sovereigns! Therefore, to experts in the chaos, using Dao power crystals to trade was the most suitable! A first level venerable sovereign can form more than three hundred pieces in a year without rest or sleep. They can form one piece a day. "Chaos Crystal!Li Hao realized that he could do that too. It was just that ... He must be out of his mind to waste this time condensing a great Dao crystal.I can do anything with this time.300 yuan a year, that was only 3 million Yuan in 10000 years. If he didn't sleep or cultivate, he didn't know what 3 million Yuan could be exchanged for."How many Dao crystals do I need to buy a small world?"Hearing Li Hao's words, the giant pincer was stunned. Then, it said, somewhat embarrassed,""Under normal circumstances, it's bartering. Very few people will use a small world to exchange for great Dao crystals ... Of course, if you urgently need them, there was a transaction record three thousand years ago. A venerable sovereign spent nearly ten million great Dao crystals to complete the exchange."A first level venerable sovereign had spent 30000 years without rest in exchange for a small world. After devouring it, he might be able to enter the second level, or even the third level ...Was it worth it?It was hard to say!In any case, it was definitely not worth it for Li Hao.Besides, the great Dao crystal was not very useful to venerable sovereigns. Of course, it was very useful to those below venerable sovereigns, even Heavenly Kings and half-sovereigns. The great Dao crystal condensed from the chaos Qi was still very helpful for cultivation.It was much more high-end than pure energy crystals. It was considered a high-end product of energy stones that were directly extracted from chaos.But for Li Hao, 30000 years ... No matter what I do, I should be able to advance to the third stage, right?Of course, the current Li Hao was penniless. He didn't have any Dao crystals.He didn't have the time to gather all of this.At this moment, he glanced at the streets. There were strong and weak ones. The strong were venerable sovereigns, and the weak were only at the level of the mountains and seas in his eyes. They were really nothing. Anyone who dared to make a deal under the eyes of a venerable sovereign would usually have a backer."There's a Hui Long Pavilion here. It's where I trade ... I can't guarantee the authenticity of other places, but there's usually no fake goods in the Hui Long Pavilion. If you're interested, you can go there and take a look."Li Hao shook his head."Forget it. I don't have a Dao crystal ...""It's okay!""For venerable sovereigns, I'll give them special treatment when I return to the Dragon Temple," the giant pincer said enthusiastically."If senior takes a fancy to some small things, I'll give them to you for free. If it's more than a hundred ... Senior can also put it on credit ..."

Chapter 2598 Fearless And Fearless (2)
On credit?Even Li Hao laughed. The chaos was so big. If I ran away on credit, would you still be able to get me back?Of course, the other party definitely had some tricks up his sleeve.A sixth rank venerable sovereign was not to be trifled with.This time, the Dragon Temple was a little interesting. Strictly speaking, they had done a good job in receiving people and treating things well. They had also tried their best to win over venerable sovereigns ... However, the more they did so, the more they were seeking.Logically speaking, with a rank six venerable sovereign in charge, unless they provoked a great world, they would not be in any danger.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  However, they still spent a lot of effort to win over venerable sovereigns ... Perhaps they had the intention of attacking the great world, or, as the giant pincer said, they were ready to attack some major forces at any time, such as the neo martial world.He didn't say much. These treasures were mere worldly possessions, and Li Hao was not interested in them. Putting everything else aside, he still had a mid-tier world in his hands, and he had no interest in devouring it. Furthermore, Silver Moon was his home, so he would not do something like that. He was even less interested in anything else.At Li Hao's level, his thinking was simple. He wanted to come into contact with more DAOs and comprehend more DAOs. What he lacked now was a deeper understanding of the great Dao.This was the first reason. The second reason was the amount of energy needed to advance.This was actually not very important.Once he had comprehended the Tao technique, would he still lack energy?It was inevitable that it would take a long time to absorb and release chaotic energy, but he had realized that energy ... Was simply not enough. He could provoke the chaos lightning tribulation, which actually contained a large amount of destructive power.After destroying the lightning, a large amount of energy would still gather.Of course, there were very few people in the primordial chaos who dared to think or do such a thing. They probably didn't fear the chaos lightning tribulation."No need. Let's go to the Coiling Dragon's Well to take a look ... Forget it, I'll go by myself!"The giant pincer was startled. He could not see through this person.New venerable sovereigns would usually be interested in these things. It was not like they had to buy them. Besides, I can give you anything less than 100 crystals when I return to the Dragon Temple.To a first stage venerable sovereign, it was extremely difficult to save up a hundred pieces in a year.It's equivalent to saving you a year of effort ... Although the lifespan of venerable sovereigns is almost infinite, and a year is not too long, you don't want it for free?This person ... Was quite interesting."Senior, there are probably still some venerable sovereigns comprehending at the Coiling Dragon Well. Why don't I go with you, in case you're not familiar with the situation ..."Not familiar with the situation?Li Hao glanced at him, smiled, and nodded slightly.""Alright!"The giant pincers were slightly stunned again.Most of the time, venerable sovereigns didn't want to bring people with them when they went to comprehend. Li Hao didn't refuse him when he said so. Did he think that he could not comprehend anything?Venerable sovereigns were all extremely arrogant.The venerable sovereigns, who came for the first time, were afraid that others would follow them because they felt that they might comprehend something extraordinary and be seen by these people. After all, they were from the Huilong temple.At this moment, he couldn't tell whether the young man before him felt that he couldn't comprehend anything, or if he really didn't care about what he knew.What an interesting venerable sovereign!There were actually two extremes for newly-advanced venerable sovereigns. One was extreme pride, thinking that they were the most powerful in the world, while the other old venerable sovereigns had just advanced a little longer than them.One was extreme vigilance, vigilance against everything, for fear that others would target him, feeling that the world was full of malice and danger.Li Hao ... Didn't look like a newly-advanced venerable sovereign. Although he looked like one, he had the bearing of an old venerable sovereign.The giant pincer had seen many venerable sovereigns, and at this moment, countless thoughts were running through its mind.Of course, he didn't say it out loud. He immediately came to his senses and said,""Okay, I'll bring you in, senior ... Senior ... Just talk less. If you encounter venerable sovereigns, I'll handle them. After all, I'm a cultivator of the Huilong temple. I'll show some respect to them and avoid unnecessary conflicts!"Li Hao nodded again.As for the giant pincer, it hesitated for a moment before saying,""Senior, if you're willing to join my Dragon return temple, you don't have to go through so much trouble ... My Dragon return temple has a good understanding of all the Taoist connotation places ...""No need!"Li Hao smiled."I'm used to freedom. I don't like being bound."The giant pincer nodded slightly.Most venerable sovereigns were like this.However, a first level venerable sovereign had just entered the primal Chaos. It was not as easy as he had imagined!The person in front of him shouldn't be from any major power.In this case, it would be even more difficult in the future.He stopped trying to persuade Li Hao. He led Li Hao across the market and went straight to the Coiling Dragon Well. There were a few venerable sovereigns in the market. Some glanced at Li Hao, while others ignored him.There were many venerable sovereigns coming and going in this place.……A huge yellow pit.It was extremely huge!The giant pincers led Li Hao across the market and into the deep pit. As they walked, they said,""Senior, the Coiling Dragon Well is said to be the place where a seventh rank venerable sovereign comprehended the Dao. However, in recent years, the Taoist connotation has not appeared for a long time. But according to the records, the last time the Taoist connotation appeared was eight thousand years ago ... I was not here at that time, so I have not seen it with my own eyes.""It's said that when the Taoist connotation appeared, a giant dragon circled around it. The senior who sensed the Taoist connotation benefited a lot and directly advanced from level two to level three ..."

Chapter 2599 Fearless And Fearless (3)
"He's also a dragon race cultivator. It's said that he's already at Level 4. In less than 10000 years, he went from Level 2 to Level 4. He's a legend in the entire tianfang world ..."To most venerable sovereigns, it was indeed a legend to go from the second level to the fourth level in 10000 years.As for neo martial, there were a few seventh level venerable sovereigns. Neo martial had only been around for a thousand years, so it could only be said to be a legend.Of course, neo martial arts had a deep foundation. It had gone through several eras of beginner martial arts and origins. The great Dao of origins had been perfected by a group of peerless geniuses, including heaven's will. It had been perfected all this time, and only then did it have the foundation of a great world.Compared to Silver Moon ... Silver moon's Foundation was far inferior.When a human King stepped out of the neo martial world, he would be a middle stage venerable sovereign. In just a short thousand years, he had gone from the middle stage to the high stage. How he had done it, he could only ask himself."I'll take you to the place where the previous senior was comprehending. There should be other venerable sovereigns there. This is the place with the most venerable sovereigns in the past eight thousand years ..."Li Hao nodded slightly.The two of them quickly crossed the void and flew over.Li Hao looked down at the ground. The yellow pit looked like a place where a giant dragon was circling.Silvermoon did not have a Dragon.Silver Moon did have a huge snake, the Snake King of Mount kui. However, that Snake King was not too strong and had not yet transformed into a Dragon. Thus, other than the Dragon Li Hao saw at the entrance of tianfang world, he had not seen any other Dragons.Dragons had appeared in many legends and myths.Even the Silver Moon had a legend about Dragons.A rank seven venerable Emperor giant dragon ... Had it cultivated the Path of Blood Qi and the physical body?Li Hao looked down at the land, but he didn't sense any lingering traces of the great Dao.The two of them landed on a small mound. At that moment, there were several venerable sovereigns on the mound. Li Hao glanced at them. Of the three venerable sovereigns, two were as strong as Li Hao, and one was probably a second level venerable sovereign.There were two men and one woman. One of them looked like a human, but Li Hao could tell at a glance that he was a demon in human form.As for what kind of demon it was, Li Hao could only investigate it, but it was obviously impolite. Li Hao did not probe further. He only glanced at the three of them and nodded slightly without saying anything.Among the three, the second level venerable sovereign glanced at Li Hao and didn't care anymore.The giant pincer was extremely careful and hurriedly called out,""I'm sorry to trouble you, seniors. I'm giant Pincher from Dragon Temple. I've brought this senior here to observe ..."The second stage venerable sovereign ignored him. The woman also ignored the man and woman.The other man glanced at Li Hao and said indifferently,""It's fine if you want to observe, but ... This is the place where venerable sovereigns gather. Can't you walk?"Li Hao glanced at him. Under normal circumstances, venerable sovereigns rarely took the initiative to cause trouble.However ... This place was different. Perhaps some people were deliberately causing trouble."I'm new here, so I'm not familiar with this place ... Sorry to make you laugh. "  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Li Hao's tone was calm, and he smiled.""The giant pincer is more familiar with this place. I'll leave after I take a look. I won't disturb you."The other two still ignored him.The venerable sovereign who had spoken earlier spoke again,""Don't you understand the principle of first come, first served? This place can only accommodate three venerable sovereigns. There's not enough space for more than three ..." Li Hao was puzzled.There should at least be a conflict of interest if he took the initiative to find trouble!'Besides, we're both first level venerable sovereigns. You're not destined to be stronger than me ... What are you doing?'He was a little puzzled.A venerable sovereign was not an idiot. The other two venerable sovereigns did not say anything, but this first level venerable sovereign did not find it troublesome and took the initiative to provoke the other venerable sovereign.What was he after?Do you think you can crush me?Or what?It was rare to encounter such a situation!Li Hao found it a little strange. If that level two venerable sovereign wanted to find trouble with him and Rob him of his blood essence to see if he could open up some of his Taoist connotation ... He would understand.You're just a 1st rank ... I really don't understand."What do you mean, fellow Daoist?""What do you mean? There's not enough space!""Also, I can sense a sword intent from you ... Are you a swordsman?" the man said indifferently."I don't really like sword Xiu!" His eyes were cold.Li Hao raised his eyebrows. Did a swordsman eat your food?On the other hand, the giant pincer's expression changed slightly. It was slightly nervous as it quickly transmitted,""Senior, this man is a venerable sovereign of the Yunyang world. The Yunyang world is a medium-level world, and the master of the world is a fourth-level peak venerable sovereign ... But ... A few years ago, he provoked the Yin Yang sword venerable of the neo martial world and was killed by him!""After that, the two venerable sovereigns of the Yunyang world fled to the tianfang great world. There was also a third-stage venerable sovereign!"Sword Saint!Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He was really ... Speechless.He was already here, yet he could still hear The Legend of the Sword venerable.Venerable sword had killed a fourth-rank peak venerable Emperor, who was a medium-level world Lord ... That meant he was at least a fifth-rank world Lord!This strength was not weak.The revered Sword Master was not considered one of the best in neo martial arts ...Of course, according to Li Hao's thoughts, the strength of venerable the sword might be slightly stronger. The Silvermoon new Dao universe had a lot to do with venerable the sword. An expert who could even trigger a great Dao universe, venerable the sword might be close to the sixth level, or even already at the sixth level. No wonder he's not so friendly to me.The first reason was his sword will. The second reason was that there was a third stage venerable sovereign behind him.
