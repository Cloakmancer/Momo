They were not venerable sovereigns, but they were still alive after running around in the chaos and into the dragon field, where there were chaos beasts everywhere ... These two were really strong."I wonder who he went to harm."Li Hao said, and Qian Wuliang continued,"Do we need to get close to them?""Along the way?""If we're going straight to the dragon world ... It should be on the way.""That's fine too ... Let's just do it randomly. If we meet them, we can take a look."Li Hao didn't look for them. They were clearly trying to get rid of him, and he was so annoying to them ... It didn't matter if he met them or not.​ Li Hao didn't expect that the two of them would rather risk their lives and leave Tian Fang.How bold!At this moment, they were approaching a world. The world didn't look big, and from its aura, it was probably the size of a rank three small world. When the Black Panther approached, an extremely huge beast suddenly appeared in the sky.It looked a little like a Kirin, but also a little like a dog ...The giant beast's spirit suddenly came."The venerable sovereigns ahead, stop!"The behemoth's psyche fluctuated,'our realm is not open to the outside world. If you want to rest, you can head to the fire Phoenix great world further ahead! The firephoenix great world is open to the public and can accommodate any chaos race's venerable sovereigns ..."He didn't dare to open a Stage 3 world to the outside world.Moreover, the person in front of him seemed to be a middle-stage venerable sovereign. It was too dangerous, and the other party did not dare to let the Black Panther get close.If they got close, it would mean that they were invading.Before the Black Panther could speak, the giant beast continued,""Fellow Daoist, if you're hungry ... I can offer you tens of millions of two-legged beasts for you to eat. In addition, if this is your first time entering the Dragon field, I'd like to remind you that the Dragon field and the chaotic race are not allowed to kill each other. Otherwise, the Dragon race will interfere!"The Black Panther was a little confused. Two-legged beast?It let out a soft roar. At this moment, Li Hao, who was under his ear, looked at the Black Panther in confusion ... What's going on with this dog? you're already at rank 5, and you're not even willing to speak even when your spiritual waves are fluctuating. What's the matter? Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Roars should be a special communication system used by beasts. Li Hao could actually understand some of it, but this kind of message transmission was similar to subtitles. The voice was the roar ... It was different from mental waves.The Tier 3 giant beast didn't mind. Some chaos beasts liked to do this and were used to it. The other party's spirit fluctuated again,""If fellow Daoist wants to try something new ... Don't you need ten million? Then ... That's fine. I'll choose some of the best quality. After you've finished eating, if you want something better, you'll have to go to the great world. The two-legged beasts there are of better quality!"As soon as he finished speaking, the power of the world suddenly fluctuated.In an instant, dozens of humans appeared outside the world. These humans had soft skin and tender flesh. They weren't strong, but they were all young cultivators. There were both men and women, and they were all handsome men and beautiful women. At this moment, they were all terrified and uneasy!The giant beast spoke in the human language with a boundless pressure.""Your luck is here. A senior is passing by and wants to try something new ... You two-legged beasts haven't offered sacrifices this year. I wanted to provide ten million blood food for you. You're not hungry, just some high-quality two-legged beasts ... If you satisfy you, your tribe will be exempted from offering blood food for the next hundred years!"As soon as he said that, the young men and women who were extremely afraid seemed to heave a sigh of relief, although they were still afraid.Free of worship!A hundred years was a long time.Originally, there were tens of millions of humans to be worshiped as blood food. Now, only a few dozen of them were needed. At this moment, a slightly older young man said with a trembling voice,""Many thanks for Dao master's bestowment ... We ... Would not dare to disturb Your Excellency's mood ..."The so-called interest was to not scream or pee their pants when they were being eaten. If they did that, it would make these demon beasts unhappy.At this moment, he felt somewhat sorrowful, but also felt that it was worth it. He looked at the others and quickly said,""Remember ... Don't ... Scream. Don't ... Wet your pants ... Even if you're afraid, you should think about our family ... Tens of millions of humans ... Today, we're the only ones ..."Everyone trembled, but they didn't say anything.As for the giant beast, it was a little impatient. Of course, it was fine as long as these two-legged beasts could serve the other party well and let the other party eat happily.A middle-rank Beast of Chaos ... Was still something it was afraid of.Get lost!At this moment, Black Panther and the others finally understood what the so-called two-legged beast was.More importantly ... It was worth tens of millions!Even Li Hao was dazed. He knew that in the chaos, there were countless killings and the destruction of worlds was common. Ten billion people could be wiped out, and the world could be destroyed.But ... A Chaos Beast just passed by and ... Sent over ten million humans to be devoured?He treated it as a meal!This ...He had been to many places and passed by many worlds. Even for a great enemy like red Moon master, the red moon world was actually good for the people. Everyone needed people to cultivate and strengthen the great Dao universe!They wouldn't treat humans as food, and no one was interested in that.Even if they were tyrants, they could be exploited at most, but to feed on thousands of people ... This ... Was beyond Li Hao's imagination.In his mind, the humans here might not be paragons, but ... A world still needed humans. They could cultivate, perfect their DAOs, or suffer. At least they could survive.

Chapter 3131 Waves In The Heart (3)
But now ...Li Hao was stunned for a moment. Beside him, Kong Ji frowned and said telepathically,""This is the first time I've heard about this. But my father once said that whoever could establish faith in the Dragon field and unite the human race ... Not to mention the ninth level venerable sovereigns, if the light could cover the Dragon field, it would be easy for him to reach the peak of the eighth level ..."He didn't understand it in the past, but now, he seemed to understand it!Kong Ji frowned.They were just passing by. They were just a small world, yet millions of people were sacrificed so easily ... Was the Dragon field so bloody, chaotic, and cold-blooded?There were also demon clans in the three big regions. Some venerable sovereigns would also target the demon clan, but ... They would not usually do so.In worlds like Silvermoon and neo martial, humans were the rulers. The demons would have some enmity, but it was not to the point where they would slaughter all the demons and treat them as food.The chaos, the humans, and the paragons!But here, were these demons and chaos beasts so unscrupulous?Didn't any human powerhouses care?At this thought, he thought of his father, one of the few level eight venerable sovereigns in the human race ... It seemed like ... He didn't really care.He was just saying it!This was the Dragon field, where a Dragon Lord, a rank eight venerable sovereign, existed. It did not seem worth it to go against a rank eight Lord for a group of unknown, weak humans from another world.Kong Jue was silent.However ... There were some things that weren't worth it. Humans could be oppressed here. Every world had its own way of survival, but this way of survival had simply crossed his bottom line.Li Hao was also silent for a while.He had killed many people.When the four large worlds were destroyed, many people had actually died. When war broke out, the number of people who died might be more than ten million. At this moment, it did not seem like a big deal for the other party to send over ten million people as blood food.However, there were some things that he still had a bottom line.Even if they were only humans from the other world, to treat humans as food ... This was a trampling on the entire human race!In the vast chaos, there were countless worlds in the four-sided domain. There were many human venerable sovereigns, a bunch of Level Seven and level eight.It was definitely more than the Dragon field!Wasn't anyone ... Going to give him a warning?Even if he didn't make a move and only gave a warning, with so many venerable sovereigns, it would only take one word from each of them. The Dragon Master wouldn't dare to be unscrupulous, right?At the very least, he still had to put on a show, right?At this moment, Li Hao thought of many things. He remembered that when he first left Silver Moon province and roamed the world, he had seen someone being enslaved, and he had even been furious ...He also thought of the time when he roamed the pugilistic world, where he said that he would use his sword to rule the world and sweep away all injustices. Just follow my heart!A Martial Master was about settling grudges!After entering the chaos, there were not many injustices. Even the Crimson Moon was just an enemy. You kill me, I kill you. It was normal for someone to die. There was not much enmity. They were just enemies. You die, I live. It was a very simple logic.There was no justice to speak of, and there was no injustice to speak of. New martial arts wasn't a good thing, nor was red Moon. Li Hao wasn't either ... Who was better?But ... He suddenly felt a little annoyed.His heart, which had been calm all this time, suddenly felt a little indignant.You can enslave the human race, oppress the human race, and rule the human race ... But when you reach the venerable sovereign level, do you still need to rely on eating people to strengthen yourself?Just like himself, could he become stronger by eating demons?No!At this point, he no longer ate anything. Other than the power of great DAOs, what else was there to eat?Just for the desire of food, not for the sake of becoming stronger or anything else, just for a moment of pleasure, he would even send tens of millions of human beings as food to a passing venerable sovereign?His calm heart was suddenly filled with anger at this moment!It was hateful and murderous!"Black Panther, ask it if it can eat more and better things when it goes to other worlds ... All the worlds!"The Black Panther seemed to have felt its anger. At that moment, it roared again.Very quickly, the other party's spiritual fluctuations appeared.""Of course! Senior's strength is extraordinary and the journey is tiring, so I'm only offering some two-legged beasts. Who would be so stingy to not give it? senior can come to me. Although my world is poor, I'll make up for it even if I have to sell everything I have!"  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 The Black Panther was silent.Li Hao took a deep breath."Take these people in and send them to the Silvermoon world. Let's go. We'll take a look at the so-called Inferno Phoenix great world ..."There was no stopping, no killing.It was just a Stage 3 world, and killing would not change anything. Just like back then, he was not in a hurry to do anything, and he allowed his people to continue being slaves in the mine.If he wanted to do it ... He had to do it thoroughly. Otherwise, it would only bring about an even greater disaster.He wanted to see if the Dragon field was devouring people everywhere as this guy had said!At this moment, Li Hao only wanted to observe the Dao of some chaos beasts, but now ... His mind changed. His heart, which had been calm for a long time, was filled with anger again!It had been a long time since he had caused such a huge wave.Even if they broke through the Crimson Moon, they would just laugh it off. There was nothing to be happy about, and there was nothing to be crazy about.The Black Panther didn't say much. It opened its huge mouth and swallowed the dozens of men and women. Some of them were trembling, some of them were ashen-faced, and some of them had dull eyes. They didn't even cry or make a fuss.On the other hand, the leading young man looked at the world behind him with some reluctance and reluctance."If we die, we can save tens of millions of people from the tribe ... It's worth it!p All of this fell into Li Hao's eyes. He did not say anything, and the Black Panther did not stay any longer. It headed straight for the so-called Fire Phoenix great world.Behind him, the giant beast heaved a sigh of relief.Fortunately, a few dozen two-legged beasts were enough to settle it. He thought he would have to pay a lot of money.

Chapter 3132 Meeting Again (1)
Black Panther led the group forward.Li Hao and Kong Ji stood under the huge ears. Kong Ji seemed to feel Li Hao's anger and said,""Don't do anything rash ... The Dragon field is very powerful. Let's observe the situation first!""I know,"Li Hao didn't say anything. He was very calm. The angrier he was, the calmer he was.Anger would not make him lose control.Kong Ji seemed to want to talk about something and said,"The law of the jungle ..."He actually wanted to say that some situations could not be changed.Li Hao nodded and sent a voice transmission."I know that the strong prey on the weak and that the dark forest rules are the law of the jungle. However ... I feel that as an expert, he doesn't bully the weak for survival or to slaughter the common people. How strong can such an expert be?"Survival, pursuit of Dao, war, and conflict of ideas could all kill.However, Li Hao couldn't bear the fact that he treated humans as food purely out of his desire for food. He looked at Kong Ji and said,""The three-sided regions occupied by humans are very powerful. Why haven't we seen humans slaughtering countless demons just to satisfy the strong cultivators 'appetite?"Kong Ji thought for a while and said,"humans are more rational than beasts. Beasts have more instincts. Humans are educated, while beasts are just some ancient inheritances. They are connected by blood. Therefore, beasts are more wild and bloodthirsty."He analyzed the situation from a theoretical perspective, but Li Hao shook his head."No, it's because ... Some of the powerful existences in the human race are too greedy and selfish ... It's fine if they're selfish, but they don't dare to offend an Overlord like the Dragon Lord! Everyone, from level eight to venerable sovereigns who have just left the world, is thinking about this ... The Dragon field is actually relatively simple and easy to solve!"Yes, it was too easy.As long as a few level eight venerable sovereigns gave the order together, the Dragon Lord would not dare to be so unscrupulous no matter how bold he was!It was just a matter of one sentence!However, no one said it. If they did, they would offend the Dragon Lord and pose a threat to their status and rule. Even the light Thearch was included.Kong Ji was a little embarrassed. He thought for a while and said,""There are other reasons ... We are not from the same world, so ..."He didn't know what to say.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"no, let me make an assumption. It's just an assumption. If the neo-martial human King unified the other three regions, he wouldn't care about the Dragon field. However, would the beasts in the Dragon field dare to treat humans as food so unscrupulously?"Kong Ji thought for a while. The human King had unified the three regions, but he didn't care about this side. Would the experts of the Dragon field be afraid?He would!This had to do with one's personality. The Dragon Lord knew the other eighth rank venerable sovereigns well and was not worried that they would oppose him. However, the human King ... Even if the other party did not know and did not care, the Dragon Lord and the others would be afraid and fearful. That was because the human King could turn hostile at any moment and kill them all!Kong Ji exhaled."You mean ... The leaders of the humans in the square domain are too cowardly and selfish ...""Did the Dragon field dare to do this when the master of tianfang was here?"Li Hao asked in return.Kong Ji shook his head."At that time, the Beasts of Chaos didn't even have a base in the square zone. The Dragon field isn't the Dragon field yet. In the early years, this place was also the territory of the human race.""Isn't this bullying the weak and fearing the strong?""So," Li Hao asked again,"the current level eights, including the group of Level Seven venerable sovereigns, are all pushovers in the Dragon Lord's eyes, right?""You can say that."Kong Ji nodded again.At this moment, he didn't say anything more, because these people included his father.He didn't continue on this topic, but asked,""Then what are you going to do? In the Dragon field, there were rank eight venerable sovereigns, rank seven venerable sovereigns ... And there were many rank seven venerable sovereigns who had the home ground advantage! This isn't like those non-Daoist Masters of Red Moon. The rank Sevens here, other than those from Dragon World, are almost all Daoist Masters. Their battle strength is stronger than Qi Shui, who we killed before. Qi Shui was killed by us because he left Qi Water World!"We can't deal with it.At the moment, the two of them could deal with a rank seven if he didn't have the backing of a great world or a non-Dao Lord expert from a rank eight world.However, once it was a rank seven master, the two of them would not be able to deal with it even if they joined forces.This was the difference between a master and a non-master.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 The Dragon field was someone else's territory. They, together with Silver Moon, were comparable to a weak rank seven world. That was the limit, but there were at least a dozen rank Seven Worlds in the Dragon field."I'll use battle to feed battle!"Li Hao's face was calm."Today, I've opened more than a thousand little realms, but only five or six hundred little realms have real energy. Not even half!" When my little realm reaches 1000, I can fight Grade 7 alone!"Of course, this was just an expectation. Whether or not it could be done, he would have to complete it first."The Dragon field, there are many realms ..."Li Hao looked around and said slowly,"according to the words of the Silvermoon people, this trip is to eliminate the strong and help the weak, and to protect justice!" This way, I will have enough reason to slaughter them!"He looked at the desolate chaos, and his eyes gradually became determined."Not only that! It's not the Beasts of Chaos in the Dragon field, or rather, it's not just their fault. There's also ... The chaos of the rules and the inaction of the strong. I once told Yao si, the head of the night patrol, to not meddle in politics when you're not in your position!"

Chapter 3133 Meeting Again (2)
"If you want to be a ruler, an Overlord of chaos, a leader ... Then you can't do this!""Internally, strike with a heavy blow! To the outside world, he was a yes-man! "At this moment, I thought of some people, of the people I killed. In the past, they suppressed the Silver Moon world and the human race! To the outside world, to some demons, even though the demons are weak, they still kneel and lick the boots of others ..."Li Hao sneered,'in their eyes, oppressing the weak and oppressing their own people gives them a greater sense of achievement! "As for foreign enemies ... At worst, they'll just cede territory and pay indemnities, offering blood and food in exchange for a short period of peace. That's the best outcome ... In history, this kind of thing is too common. Even if the world is strong and the country is strong, they still can't do without this group of people ...""In their minds, outsiders have a higher status. Even if those tribes are extremely weak ... They'd rather treat them with respect than offend them! Even if a few rank eight venerable sovereigns order around the rank seven venerable sovereigns, they may have to be extremely polite to some rank six and rank seven venerable sovereigns in the Dragon field. They leave their dignity to the inner ranks, their cruelty to their own people, and their so-called respect and face to the outsiders ..."Kong Ji looked at him, speechless.Was this the case?Thinking about it carefully ... Perhaps, that was the case.In the three regions, even when facing the other rank 7s, a rank 8 human venerable sovereign was still extremely majestic and looked down on them.However, in the Dragon field, he would be very polite to some Level Seven masters.This was inevitable.No matter who it was, including his father, there was a high chance that it would be the same."This ... Is considered respect for all living things ..."Li Hao shook his head."No, respect is mutual. If the other party respects you, you should respect the other party!" Brother kongji, respect is not a matter of one party! One side respects you, while the other side treats you like food. This is not respect, this is ... Kneeling and licking!""So, I'm thinking of a problem ... Even if you kill all the Beasts of Chaos, you can't keep killing them or even exterminate their entire race. There must be some innocent people among them. So, if these people always rule the square zone, sooner or later, the incident in the Dragon field will repeat itself!""That's right," Li Hao said indifferently."In my opinion, these so-called human leaders should be killed!"He said it so calmly.Even Kong Ji was stunned.In his impression, although Li Hao was decisive in killing, he ... Would not be so cold-blooded.Li Hao, on the other hand, chuckled and said,"in the past, I was in Silver Moon, and the nine divisions were in charge of the country!" In fact, not everyone in the nine divisions deserved to die, and not all of the leaders of the nine divisions did evil ... But in the end, I almost killed them all. Do you know why?"Kong Ji frowned and shook his head."I don't know. Is it because I'm blocking your way?" "No. It's because they failed their duty. In my opinion, failure ... Is more terrible than corruption, brutality, cold-blooded, and useless!""The current level 7 Masters don't actually have the ability to do so. Let's not talk about it, but the current level 8 Masters ... All of them are trying in vain to unify the four regions, but they don't deserve it. If these people really unify the four regions, it will be a disaster and disaster!"Li Hao only said this much.At this moment, he was only at the fifth step, but ... What did it matter?Back when the nine divisions ruled the world, he was not the best in any of the 99 provinces. But what was the result?"Let's go, Black Panther, to find the Queen and the king of the Li Dynasty!"The Black Panther was taken aback. Although it was on the way, Li Hao was furious. He should have gone straight to the inferno Phoenix great world. Why did he look for those two?At this moment, Li Hao was thinking about something, but he didn't know if he was saying it for himself or for them. He said slowly,""The two of them ... Shouldn't be idle right now, especially the Queen. The Queen is good at beguiling, spreading faith, and spreading faith. She's a smart person. If she's here, she'll definitely see an opportunity at this moment. She'll see ... An opportunity for faith to explode!""The humans of the Dragon field, the demon race, and the Beasts of Chaos have been suffering for a long time!"  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 "Here, you just need to do a little good, and you'll be able to harvest a large number of believers ... And they're all former Kings, skilled in spreading the way of faith. What do you think they're doing now?"Heibao seemed to have understood.They were probably harvesting faith. Black Panther knew these two too. They wouldn't be idle. Li Hao had seen something when he had just arrived. Clearly, such a phenomenon was common, and these two were here ... According to their tormenting characters, it would be strange if they weren't harvesting faith here!"Faith to prove the Dao, faith to become a monarch ... I don't like it, there are too many limitations. But to them, this is a bright path, a path to the heavens. As long as their faith is not broken, they can improve quickly, easily step into level four, or even ... Level Seven!"If there were enough people and their faith was pious enough, if 10 billion people were not enough, then 100 billion, a trillion, ten trillion ...With enough faith and believers, you can reach the heavens in one step!The path of faith and the path of the people were actually very similar.This was also an opportunity for him to grow stronger quickly. Li Hao said,""Right now, I need to take over a world ... A very large world, and use it as a Foundation to provide some people to cultivate the path of faith. I need to break through some worlds and take away the human race so that the human race can gather ... The Queen and the king of the Li Dynasty are very suitable for this kind of work."

Chapter 3134 Meeting Again (3)
Kong Ji's heart moved."You ... Want people to cultivate the path of faith. Then you ..."Li Hao had cultivated all kinds of DAOs, so why didn't he cultivate them himself? If he really had such thoughts, this might really be an opportunity. Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to survive."Faith ... Is both a good and a bad thing, just like how I don't want to be the master of the great Dao...I'm actually an irresponsible person."Li Hao shook his head and thought, I don't want my freedom to be restricted by these great DAOs! Silver Moon martial masters are after freedom, but I'm after more than them. Faith is also a restraint, I know it all too well. "It was very easy to suffer a backlash!Of course, to many people, so what if such a chance to rise to the heavens in a single step was backfired?At this moment, the Black Panther did not make a sound and silently flew in one direction.Dali King, Queen, you seem to have been targeted again.Black Panther didn't know if he should sympathize with them or envy them. Li Hao seemed to hope that these two would lead the following changes and become the vanguards, or rather, the leaders behind them, in charge of taking in humans.It was actually very difficult to take down a world with countless humans.They had to be fed, dressed warmly, and more blissful than before. They had to have food and shelter ... They had to integrate different civilizations and be responsible for their daily lives ...It sounded simple. Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, hundreds of millions, billions, tens of billions ...At this point, even venerable sovereigns would go crazy!Li Hao didn't dare to think about eating, drinking, and peeing.At the thought of it, he felt like collapsing.In any case, he was not going to place them in Silver Moon. Once he did, the system would collapse.He would completely collapse!They could only find a world and stuff people in it. At first, they could only maintain it for a little while ... To try not to starve them to death. As for the rest, they could only rely on the two of them to think of a way. If it was done well, it would definitely be a great opportunity for them!……"Achoo!"The Dali King, who was about to prove his Dao as a venerable sovereign, suddenly sneezed. He felt a little uncomfortable and a little incredulous."Don't you feel that ... There might be some changes?"The Queen frowned and did not say anything.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 He only stared at the sky. Change?I have a bad feeling about this.This premonition ... Was something that only Li Hao had ever given her.However, Li Hao should still be fighting with Red Moon, cloud sky, and the other experts. I'm already here, and there are only Beasts of Chaos and demons here.She was also a little confused. Back then, in order to avoid that annoying Li Hao, she had risked her life to run away ... Had he also come to the Dragon field?The Queen wasn't even afraid of the world Lord of this small world. At this moment, she was a little uneasy.""It can't be Li Hao, right?""That's not necessary!"The Dali King laughed,"do you need to be so afraid of him?" Besides, he's probably still fighting with those high-rank venerable sovereigns or being hunted down ... The Dragon field is dominated by the monster race and Beasts of Chaos. Why would he come here?""It's hard to say,""Anyway, it's best to stay away from him." The Queen sighed and shook her head."Don't worry, it's possible that the world Lord of this world is going to make a move on us. Be careful, don't fail."The Queen nodded and said no more.That was true.It was better to be careful of this.Li Hao ... The chaos was so big that it shouldn't be easy to encounter him.……In the Dragon field.A small world stood at the edge of the Dragon field.Recently, the master of this world had been a little troubled. He didn't know where these two half-step sovereigns had come from, but they were quite bold and dared to act wildly in his territory!As a venerable sovereign, it was easy for it to kill a half-step sovereign.But ... The reality was that these two weren't simple. Although they were only half-step sovereigns and didn't seem to be cultivators of the great world, their combat strength was powerful and they seemed to have experienced hundreds of battles. They were definitely not comparable to the two-legged beasts in the great world.The two of them were extremely cunning. Even if it was a world Lord, it couldn't find them easily. It found them. They had fought once before, but the two of them had escaped.And now, the more troublesome thing was that a large number of two-legged beasts had been taken away by the other party ... In fact, it did not care about these two-legged beasts. The key was that without them, the Beasts of Chaos and demons under its command were somewhat disobedient.They were used to eating, but now there was suddenly a lot less. The key was that the remaining two-legged beasts were also eager to escape ... This was very troublesome.Chaos beasts were not good at governing the world.The evolution and development of the world were still better for the human race. If you were given a desert, you could develop it into a green space. However, the beasts of primordial chaos were better at destruction. Would they let their men develop the world?It was impossible.Without these guys, the development of the world would also stagnate. This was very uncomfortable for any world Lord. No world Lord would want their world to stop growing.Whether they ate or killed ... They wouldn't usually finish eating and kill all of them. They would also talk about sustainable development, so that the development of the world would not stop.But now, the entire world was at a standstill, which affected the fundamental interests of this Chaos Beast."You two bastards!"This rat-like beast of primordial chaos was a little annoyed and angry.

Chapter 3135 Meeting Again (Part Four)
If word of this got out, he would be laughed at by the other experts of the chaos race.In his own world, he actually couldn't deal with two half-step sovereigns. This was simply laughable."Did you find them?"At this moment, it stared at the half-emperors below and let out an angry roar."Not ... Not yet ..."Below, a half-step sovereign was somewhat apprehensive."Those two fellows were hiding very well. We even killed many of the two-legged beasts that they took away ... They didn't appear. We were also worried that if we killed all of them and they didn't appear, it would affect the development of the world ... So we didn't continue to kill them ... But as soon as we left, they appeared and killed a large number of our tribesmen ..."After saying that, he looked at the big rat with some anticipation.As the world Lord, he had the power to control the world. Logically speaking, it should be easy to find them, but their world Lord ... Seemed to be powerless.This was very confusing!The large rat did not say a word, but it cursed in its heart.As the masters of the world, chaos beasts were different from humans in one way. Under normal circumstances, they were not from the local world, but outsiders. Their control of the world was actually not as good as the masters of the world that had truly risen from the local world.These two guys were good at playing hide-and-seek, so it was not easy to track them.It was still thinking about how to find them, when suddenly ... It was a little confused. Soon, it floated into the air and headed straight for the realm gate. Was there an expert passing by?It was as if they had sensed a powerful aura approaching.……Outside the small world.The Black Panther was extremely fast and was approaching a world. At this moment, Hong Yitang's voice came from the Black Panther's body."I feel like we're about to meet King Dali and the others. They should be in the world ahead!"Li Hao looked into the distance. It was a small world, about Level 1 or Level 2. In the chaos, it was as small as a Firefly.It was not like the great world, which was like a giant sun.A Tier 1 and Tier 2 world ... No wonder these two people were still alive. Be it the Li Dynasty's King or the Queen, they had all fought with him before. They had also been fighting with li daoheng, Zheng Yu, and the others.These people were not inferior to ordinary venerable sovereigns.If there was only one or two rank one venerable sovereigns in Silver Moon, they might not be able to do anything to them since they were still alive.Even though they were far apart, Li Hao had a strange feeling.A unique power of faith seemed to have been born in this world.He suddenly laughed."I was wondering why these two fellows didn't return. It turns out...They're really spreading their faith here!"Even though he had already guessed it, he still couldn't help but be impressed by what he had sensed. Did these two fellows know what kind of place this was?The Dragon field!A bunch of Level 7 and level 8 cultivators. You two half-step sovereigns actually dared to spread the path of faith here and accept humans ... You're really too bold. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  If a powerful venerable sovereign passed by and didn't like you, he could easily kill you.What a bold fellow!……Very quickly, the Black Panther was close to the other party.At this moment, a large rat appeared above the world, and a spiritual fluctuation came.""Which senior has come to our world? Senior must be tired from the journey, do you need some blood and flesh to eat? the world is too small, it's not convenient to call senior ..."The large rat was rather polite. Just as the giant beast had said, when a powerful Chaos Beast like the Black Panther passed by, the Masters of the small realms would take the initiative to provide some blood food to avoid trouble.It's best to leave after eating!……At the same time.The king of Dali looked at the Queen, and the Queen looked back at him.After a long time, the Dali King slowly said,"do you ... Feel it?"The Queen rubbed her forehead. Her cold face revealed a depressed look. She gritted her teeth and said,"I can feel it, Silver Moon ... Universe!"艹!She wanted to curse.Damn it.I'm already here, but Li Hao is still haunting me. What a headache.He's here!That's right, the Queen was now certain that it was Silver Moon, or rather, Li Hao, who had arrived. She could already sense a familiar presence, and that world Lord seemed to be welcoming someone.There was no need to think ... It was probably a Black Panther.The Black Panther was also a beast of primordial chaos.Needless to say, the Silvermoon world was inside the Black Panther's body.p She was a little helpless and glanced at the king of Dali.""It's all your fault!"The Dali King was speechless. What does it have to do with me?"It must be because you're involved with celestial pole ... Celestial pole can't bear to part with you and wants you to go back."Bullshit!The Dali King was speechless. With Heaven's Fate's personality, even if I died outside, he wouldn't even bother to look at me. Why would he come and find me?He was a little indignant,"it was you!" I think it's because Li Hao can't bear to part with you ... You've been hooking up with him ..."The Queen was furious!"You dare to slander this King?" he roared.Who hooked up with Li Hao?The Dali King laughed disdainfully. This former king was not afraid of this woman at this moment. Why, can't I say something?Think about it, which of Li Hao's enemies is still alive?As for me ... I was tactful enough to compromise with Silver Moon a long time ago."In addition to that, Heaven's Fate gave them face, so they didn't kill me.And you?In the end, you still harbored some ill intentions. Li Hao didn't kill you, so there might be some inside information.The Queen was a little angry and couldn't be bothered to talk to him anymore.However, at this moment, he heaved a sigh of relief.""Li Hao is here ... He's probably going to do something big. If the same thing happens in the Dragon field, he'll probably start a massacre if he thinks of something like this!"

Chapter 3136 Meeting Again (Part 5)
At this point, he was slightly stunned and looked at the king of Dali.""Do you think ... He's just passing by, or did he come here to find us, and then ... He wants us to work for him?"Work?The king of Dali was also stunned. What work?"Forget it, let's go and take a look!"At this moment, the Queen was too lazy to say anything more. She was no longer afraid of the world Lord. She went to the realm gate to take a look. Li Hao's group might have come here for them.If we don't meet him, he'll find an excuse to say that we don't respect him. He'll slap us each and we'll all die!……The outer realm.p This time, the Black Panther didn't say anything. Li Hao directly sent a mental wave: "I smell something sweet. There seem to be two people with good tastes in your realm ... Offer them to me!"His nose was really sharp!The big rat was a little speechless. He could even smell it?It knew who the other party was talking about, but ... It didn't even catch him. If it did, it would have eaten him long ago.However, at this moment, a middle-stage venerable sovereign was passing by. It didn't dare to say anything and could only say,""Senior, please forgive me. Two two two-legged beasts have entered our realm ... They're both half-step sovereigns. I haven't caught them yet ... Once I catch them, I'll offer them to senior ...""No need, I'll go in and grab it myself!"As soon as he said that, the big rat was a little nervous.""Senior, there are experts patrolling the Dragon Realm. Our realm is not open to the outside world. The Dragon Lord has ordered that no one is to take a world with an owner!""It's just a small rank One World. Do you think I'll take a fancy to it?"Li Hao's voice was intimidating."A small world like this isn't enough. Who would dare to disobey the Dragon Lord's orders?" It was just that ... The Dragon Lord didn't say that if the world was in trouble, one couldn't help when passing by? You can't even catch two half-step sovereigns, so what's wrong with me helping you? You don't know how to be grateful, and you're even threatening me with the dragon world?"The large rat cursed again in its heart.However, after thinking about it, the other party should be a fifth level venerable sovereign, so he might not be interested in his small world. It was just that ... He still felt that it was very troublesome, so he could not help but say,""Senior, you've misunderstood. I'm just worried that it'll be too much trouble for you ... When the dragon world patrollers pass by our world, I'll report this to them, and they'll help ...""Patrol the dragon world, patrol the Dragon Realm, how long will it take to arrive at this little realm? Are you sure that before they arrive, your realm can still maintain its peace?""Are you doubting me?" Li Hao said in an imposing voice."I don't dare!"The big rat was even more depressed. It thought for a while and said,""Actually, it won't be long. According to the previous routes, the dragon world's patrol will reach our world in half a year at most ... But ... Since senior is willing to help, then ... Then senior can enter our world ..." He didn't say it clearly. He just wanted to arrest them and leave quickly.In at most half a year, the dragon world patrol will pass by. If you don't leave, I'm going to complain!As for Li Hao, he was rather emotional at this moment. The dragon world had actually sent experts to patrol the Dragon Realm. No wonder the Beasts of Chaos in the Dragon Realm were relatively more peaceful and rarely went on expeditions.With a rank eight world in charge, it would naturally have a powerful deterrent force.Strictly speaking, from the perspective of the chaos beasts, the current Dragon Master did have the bearing of an Overlord. This prevented many chaos beasts from killing each other. Otherwise, when chaos beasts met in the chaos, it would be the law of the jungle. No one would say anything even if they ate this huge rat.But now, this puny first stage venerable sovereign dared to refute the request of a fifth stage venerable sovereign. This was the confidence that the Dragon Realm brought."Dragon Lord, from the perspective of a Chaos Beast ... It's even better than what Red Moon, cloudsky, and the rest did!"Li Hao said to Kong Ji telepathically. He didn't mention light, but it was actually included.These people were all overlords of a region, but they were actually not as good as the Dragon Lord.He had never heard that these worlds would send experts to patrol a region and maintain the peace between the worlds. Those guys would not care at all unless he was going to devour a world.Kong Ji also nodded,"otherwise, do you think a Chaos Beast can stand firm in the four-sided domain?" He could even dominate a region? The Dragon Lord was truly capable and was also known as the number one chaos expert in the four-sided domain! My father also said that there are too many humans and too many powerhouses. Otherwise ... These rank eight Masters of the four regions might not be able to fight against the Dragon Lord alone!""The Dragon field has been established for less than a million years. Today, the Dragon Lord has subdued many chaos beasts ... This is evident!"The two of them conversed for a while, and the big rat was not too afraid.The realm gate was opened.There was no need for a rank five venerable sovereign to offend the Dragon Lord for the sake of a rank One World. If the Dragon Lord dared to devour this world and was discovered by the dragon world, this guy would be finished. This had happened in the past.Chaos beasts were wild and difficult to tame. In the end, the Dragon Lord even personally killed a seventh rank Chaos Beast, shocking everyone. From then on, without the Dragon Lord's permission, as long as it was a world occupied by chaos beasts, even seventh rank venerable sovereigns would not dare to take it.Of course, it didn't matter if it was the local demons or the human race. These worlds also existed in the Dragon field, and new worlds were constantly being born in the Dragon field. Most of them were dominated by humans, and they would eventually become the territory of the chaos beasts. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  ……In an instant, the Black Panther arrived at the realm gate.The realm gate of the little realm was actually very weak.A forceful attack could also break through.However, the strong attack caused a bigger commotion. The Black Panther landed directly near the realm gate. At this moment, the big rat suddenly turned around and looked, somewhat surprised.

Chapter 3137 Meeting Again (6)
It seemed to have sensed the auras of those two fellows.Is he crazy?He actually dared to take the initiative to appear!To its surprise, a man and a woman appeared in the distance. The man was overbearing, and the woman was cold. However, when they saw the Black Panther ... They both felt a little depressed.Although he had sensed it, he still felt helpless when he saw the Black Panther.What a coincidence!They met again. More importantly, Heibao seemed to be terrifyingly strong. What about Li Hao?This guy was really abnormal!"Senior, it's them!"The large rat was also shocked. It was really them. Were they crazy?Even if you want to die, you shouldn't do it this way.If I were here, I might not be able to take him down easily, but ... There's a fifth rank venerable sovereign here. The gap between them and a fifth rank venerable sovereign is too big. He can kill them with a sneeze.He actually dared to appear here, wasn't he just delivering himself to his mouth?At this moment, Li Hao had set up the sky pilfering domain, and the Nirvana world silently spread around the world. Even the sky was destroyed, so it was too easy to conceal a stage one World.The entire world had fallen into the entire realm without a sound.This was a Dao domain!More importantly, the rat monarch did not notice it at all.The difference was too great!At this moment, he was still in a state of excitement.That's good, it'll help me solve some problems.Just as he was thinking, the woman suddenly said,""Why does Lord Marquis have the time to come to such a desolate world?"The large rat was stunned. Just as it was thinking, a person suddenly appeared in front of it.It was Li Hao!The big rat was shocked. Just as it was about to scream, it suddenly found that it seemed to be frozen and couldn't move. Not only that, its Dao of chaos seemed to have been destroyed, and even its thoughts were somewhat stagnant!The Dali King and the others also saw that the venerable sovereign seemed to be unable to move. His rat eyes were wide open with disbelief!The two of them were also secretly shocked. This was a venerable sovereign, but he was subdued in an instant?How far had Li Hao reached?Li Hao glanced at the two of them and smiled.""How come you didn't vindicate Dao?""We're going to lay a good foundation here and vindicate our DAOs when we return to Silver Moon. As cultivators of Silver Moon, there's no reason for us to vindicate our DAOs outside ..."The Queen smiled.He said it as if it was true!"I'll do it. Do you feel uncomfortable?"Li Hao laughed.“……”"No, I didn 't!"The Queen quickly denied.Li Hao laughed again."It seems that I've disturbed you. However, don't you know that this is the area covered by the dragon world?" Level eight venerable sovereign! I have a bunch of rank seven venerable sovereigns under me. In at most half a year, there will be experts from the dragon world coming to patrol this place ..."The two of them were stunned. The Queen was also surprised."How can this be? a rank 8 world would care about a rank 1 World?"Previously, they had also hung out in Tian Fang.However, he had never heard of an extremely powerful world managing a small world."The Dragon field will take care of it!"Li Hao said,"the Dragon Lord is a rare Overlord among the chaos beasts. He wants to subdue the entire Chaos Beast race and dominate a region. He has a strong control over the Dragon field ... In the chaos, there are powerful patrollers who will come here in half a year!" Once that happens, this rat will no longer be the master of this realm, and you'll all be dead for sure, unless you think you can fight against a level eight venerable sovereign!"“……”The Queen had thought that Li Hao's arrival would be troublesome, but now, she was glad. She really didn't know that. In her opinion, the great world wouldn't care about the life and death of the small world, or the change of overlords in the small world.In the end, he actually cared!As for whether or not Li Hao would lie to them, that was unlikely. There was no need to.The Queen was filled with regret."So that's how it is. I was wondering why this place is the Holy Land of the path of faith. In the end ... No one came. It turns out that there's a level 8 great world supporting it!"What a pity!  Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  In that case, he could only give up the faith he had obtained. A level 8 world was not something he could afford to offend.Li Hao laughed."You won't invade a small world first, then slowly expand and become a level two, level three, or even level four venerable Emperor. You'll climb up bit by bit and become Level Seven or level eight venerable emperors, right?" If it was that simple, then all the humans in the primordial chaos would be idiots. Why didn't any of their experts come here?"“……”The Queen was a little embarrassed. 'Before this ... I was thinking this. I thought that no one had noticed it, or that they had noticed it. Because I don't cultivate the path of faith, so ...'Now it seems that I was too naive."Alright," the Queen said helplessly."Then we'll absorb the power of faith here, prove our Dao, and then ... Leave this place!""What's the hurry?""Isn't there still half a year before the patrolmen come?"Li Hao smiled.Then, he looked at the desolate world.""This world is too small, and the population isn't too large. Even if all the faith is gathered, it won't be enough for you to become Tier 3 ... Queen, king of Dali, are you interested in doing a big deal with me?"“……”Upon hearing this, the Dali King trembled a little. Please don 't, every time you say this, I'm going to be in trouble!Of course, his strength had indeed improved."Lord Marquis, you mean ..." The Queen's eyes moved slightly."Gathering ten billion, a hundred billion, a trillion ... Even ten trillion people!"Li Hao's eyes flickered."There are so many people that even Tian Fang can't contain them. If they worship you, how much will you gain?" The path of faith was relatively simple. However, it was the most difficult to make people believe in it. The human race had been through a lot. The most difficult thing was actually the simplest ... The Holy Land of faith! It's possible that a rank 7, rank 8, or even rank 9 faith Dao Emperor will be born here!"The two of them swallowed their saliva.In the next moment, he was jolted awake.How could it be that simple?When they thought about how many people there were, so densely packed that even the sky couldn't hold them ... Forget it, they would die. They didn't have such great ambitions. Having ten billion people or a hundred billion people believe in them was their limit.Any more and they would be exhausted to death. They might not even be able to digest it.Li Hao chuckled again."Don't worry. Someone will help you. Many of the Silver Moon's venerable sovereigns are idle, and there are many Silver Moon cultivators ... I'll have them assist you. Since you're idle, it's good to do something!""But the dragon world ..."Li Hao laughed."If you reach the seventh step, who cares if you're from the dragon world or not. You two might even surpass me and reach the seventh step earlier than me. You should know that I'm only at the fifth step!""According to the normal way of cultivation, the two of you ... Don't expect to surpass me in this lifetime."p The two of them struggled, but there was nothing to struggle about. The Queen accepted her fate."I have no objections!"For no other reason than Li Hao.Since he's here, are you going to refuse?What a joke.You can't refuse!She glanced at the king of Dali. What was he thinking? did he really think that she would discuss it with him?Don't you know Li Hao?"What are you thinking about? try to refuse. If you dare to refuse ... Tomorrow, I might see you being stripped naked, hung outside the world gate, and beaten up!Thinking was unnecessary!As for the king of Dali, he seemed to have understood and was somewhat helpless."Then ... I have no objections. It's a good thing. Thank you!"It was clearly a good thing, but at this moment, she was not so happy.He had to work under Li Hao's command again!Even if he had to increase his cultivation level, he was still a little unhappy.Starting his own business, even if it was a little difficult, at least it would be a little more satisfying.Li Hao laughed."What's with your expressions?" I don't think I've ever mistreated you, have I?"The two of them smiled but did not say anything.No... That would be weird!Didn't you beat us?Anyway, I'm under a lot of pressure when I'm with you.At this moment, the two of them looked at each other and felt pity for each other. They should cherish the last moments of their freedom!

Chapter 3138 The River Of Time
Meeting the Queen and the king of Dali again, his angry mood was much better.Although these two people were troublesome at times, they were quite cute at other times.These two people were the type to take the initiative to work.They were all unwilling to be lonely!If you give them a little sunlight, they can open a dye workshop for you. If you give them a fulcrum, the two of them will dare to overturn the sky.He was chatting with them.Beside him, the large rat was actually still alive and could still hear. At this moment, its eyes were filled with fear.Who was this person?It was so powerful that it couldn't move. Ordinary middle-stage venerable sovereigns could kill it, but they couldn't suppress it so easily. After all, it was a venerable sovereign, and the two people who had come to cause trouble seemed to be its subordinates.At this moment, it seemed to know something.The Silver Moon King!The Silver Moon King that everyone viewed as a vassal of neo martial!The Silver Moon King had always been shrouded in the Halo of neo martial. Even though Li Hao had done a lot of things, including the defeat of Crimson Moon, it was mainly Li Hao who had done it. However, in everyone's eyes, the defeat of Crimson Moon was due to neo martial.Li Hao didn't care about this, and he didn't want to change their minds.However, he was destined not to be shrouded by neo martial as everyone thought. Everyone would understand sooner or later that neo martial was neo martial, and silver Moon was Silver Moon. At this moment, he had finished his conversation with the king of Dali and the Queen.Li Hao looked at the world and chuckled.""The two of you have built up some Foundation here ... Why don't you do something bigger today and kill this rat monster in front of this world? perhaps you can obtain the recognition of the humans in this world!"To them, killing a world Lord was a great help.The two of them looked at each other and then at the rat monster.With a wave of Li Hao's hand, the rat monster rolled in the air, making many somersaults. Li Hao smiled and said,""You two, go! And this rat monster, I'll unseal 80% of your seal. If you can defeat the two of them, I'll give you a chance to live, but if you're killed ... That's your life!"The moment the rat monster was sent flying, its strength began to recover, and it was immediately overjoyed!The Silver Moon King was actually no longer suppressing him, even though he was still suppressing some of his strength.Maybe I can escape!However ... The next moment, the rat monster was extremely terrified.He was not the only one. At this moment, King Dali and the Queen were also shocked. Their eyes were wide open and their faces were full of disbelief. Suddenly, dozens of venerable sovereigns 'auras appeared around them. It was not just one or two, but dozens! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  They looked at the people around them and their eyes almost went blind!An acquaintance!A group of familiar faces.è‰¹!These people had all vindicated Dao?How was that possible? When did Silver Moon give birth to so many venerable sovereigns? there were only a few before, but why were there fifty to sixty venerable sovereigns here now?Yes, Li Hao had released all the venerable sovereigns.They had been in the stomach of the Black Panther all this time, observing the world and listening to everything. They knew everything that had happened.At this moment, some people had complicated expressions on their faces.For example, Jiang Li!He glanced at the Dali King ...'Your Majesty, I've already reached the venerable sovereign level, but you ... It seems that you haven' t. 'The king of Dali almost bit off his tongue.F * ck!A group of people who were far inferior to him in the past had actually become venerable sovereigns.Was this the benefit of having Li Hao's back?If he had known this ...Alright, he didn't think too much about it, but he felt a little bitter. As expected, it seemed that working hard on his own was not as good as working for Li Hao. Just look at these guys.Li Hao chuckled."Everyone, don't just watch the show. Drive all the demons and Beasts of Chaos to the central area. Don't let a single one go!""You can run now, rat. You don't have to fight. If you can survive before all the venerable sovereigns surround you, I'll give you a chance to live!"The rat monster that had wanted to escape earlier was now filled with fear.So many venerable sovereigns!Fifty-six venerable sovereigns. This was an arrangement that could only be found in a rank seven world. Ordinary rank six worlds did not even have so many venerable sovereigns.The thought of escaping earlier was instantly gone.It was impossible to escape!Not only that, the appearance of so many venerable sovereigns without causing any disturbance also meant that this world seemed to have been completely sealed off.In an instant, the rat monster disappeared.Li Hao looked at the two of them."It's a world Lord, after all, and it's much stronger than an Ordinary Level one venerable Emperor. I've suppressed 20% of its strength, so it's about the same level as a level one venerable Emperor. Can you two kill it? I'd like to see if you've made any progress without me."The king of Dali glanced at the Queen. The Queen's eyes flickered, and she glanced at Li Hao. Soon, she chuckled."Good, then let's show Marchioness Silvermoon ... Whether the two of us have improved or not!"She was surprised to see so many venerable sovereigns around, but she wasn't surprised.Li Hao was just so magical.It seemed normal that he could cultivate so many venerable sovereigns, just more than expected.In an instant, the Queen disappeared.A bright moon seemed to have appeared in the sky. The Queen's voice shook the heavens and the earth. At this moment, she seemed to have turned into a God, her voice carrying boundless Divine Majesty."I am Empyrean God lingyue! I've brought the king of the human world, the king of Dali, to vanquish demons and uphold justice ..."The power of the bright moon descended.A bright moon shone through the heavens and earth.

Chapter 3139 The River Of Time
At this moment, the Queen was using the same tricks she had used in the Western divine Kingdom. Li Hao wasn't as familiar with this as her.In an instant, everyone in the world could see the bright moon in the sky.All of a sudden ... She felt like crying.A God had descended!To save the world.They had suffered too much. The human race in the Dragon field had suffered too much.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ They had heard of this man before. It was said that he had saved many people and helped them escape from the sea of suffering. However, it was said that he was not as powerful as the world King. In their eyes, the rat monster was the most powerful existence in this world!But today, Empyrean God lingyue had appeared!……"Lingyue!"Lin Hongyu suddenly sneered,""This woman wasn't called that before, was she?"Lingyue?Above the Silver Moon?Or what?She was very unhappy. She was relatively broad-minded and could accept everyone. However, there was one bad thing about her. She could not accept some beautiful, young, and powerful women.The Queen was actually very young. She was from the same era as Li Hao. The so-called "same era"And this woman, who had opposed Li Hao time and time again, had been spared by him. After all, Li Hao had suffered the first major loss in his life at the hands of the Queen.It was directly defeated!And now, Li Hao was going to help the Queen gather billions of humans in the Dragon field ...And now, she had suddenly changed her name to Empyrean God lingyue ... This really pissed him off.Hence, he took the opportunity to vent.The more she looked at this woman, the more displeased she was. She was actually very happy that she had run away. Why did she meet her again?What a headache!Kong Ji sized up Lin Hongyu, then looked at the dazzling queen and smiled. This was interesting. He then looked at Li Hao and said telepathically,""Is Empyrean God lingyue also your sister-in-law?"“……”Li Hao glanced at him, somewhat confused and silent, as if he was very gossipy.When they first met, the other party was so refined and had such a Taoist connotation.And now, he had also become an ordinary person!Vulgar! "I have to think of a way ... To get a map of the dragon world's patrol route. Before the patrol arrives, I'll slowly nibble away at the entire Dragon field!"Li Hao didn't answer him at all, because he was too bored.Li Hao laughed."We have a lot of people now. We have a lot of venerable sovereigns. We can send them out and act on our own. I need the most accurate map of the Dragon field!""I want to know the exact strength of the Dragon field ..."​ Kong Ji's head hurt. I can't do anything about this.If he wanted the one from the tianfang region, he still had a way. However, his father might not even know the details of the Dragon region.Thinking of this, he said,'only the powerful worlds here know the Dragon field the best. Didn't senior Senlan say that there's an iron-eating world here and that it's an enemy of the Dragon race?' The enemy of my enemy ... Might be my friend. "Li Hao nodded slightly.He added,'there's one more thing we have to prevent from being discovered by experts who are passing by! Of course, there was an advantage in the Dragon field. Without the Dragon Master's order, ordinary venerable sovereigns would not dare to enter the territory of other venerable sovereigns! However, even if powerful beings don't enter, they'll still be able to sense some things ... Once a powerful being passes by, they might notice some abnormalities. "Kong Ji nodded.Li Hao continued,"so ... We need to cover it up!" I have an idea, an immature one, and I need your cooperation and help. ""Speak," he said."I want to put a coat on the Jie!"What did that mean?Kong Ji was stunned. He looked at Li Hao, who nodded. "I'm here to comprehend the primal Chaos beast's sector Lord Dao, to form a small world and swallow this world! The outer layer is one, and the inner layer is where the human race is active ..."Kong Ji understood!He gasped,'you want to ... Create a real realm?"No, there's no source of the world, so I'll share the source of the world and plant my realm in my original realm. I have a very bold idea ..."He laughed,'I need too much energy now. Since I can't break into a level Seven world, then ... I'll use the world to nurture the world! "For example, this small world can support my world. I want to extract all the energy from it, including the source of the world ... As for the end, this world will be broken and my world will be completed! Of course, my final plan is to break into the dragon world, take it, and provide for the humans in the Dragon Realm!"Using the realm to nurture the realm!Previously, Li Hao didn't have such an idea. At his level, he was actually unwilling to devour small and medium-sized worlds, because he needed to devour too many. One World supported One World, and he would need at least a few hundred worlds to reach Level 6.This was too much of a sin!But ... In the Dragon field, he had let go.Be it these beasts of primordial chaos or the demons, he would kill and slaughter them when he needed to.At this moment, he was using his fake world to cover the real world and secretly devour the power of the world and the source of the world ... He could still cover it up a little. There were definitely hundreds of small and medium-sized worlds such as the Dragon Realm. There might even be more.This way, if no one discovered it for a long time, he could easily nurture the realm and step into the sixth level. He could fill up thousands of realms and become a true sixth level venerable sovereign.In the distance, a battle broke out.In the world, a large number of roars could be heard. There were roars from the humans here, as well as countless roars from the demons and chaos beasts.
