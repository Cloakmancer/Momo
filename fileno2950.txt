It was obvious that Sen LAN was deliberately throwing the game.The venerable sovereign beside him quickly sent a message, bloodthirsty, attack, and break it directly! Even if Senlan suffered heavy casualties, it's Senlan's problem. Even if the Dao universe is damaged, it won't be too serious ..."It was just that the result might not be too satisfactory.Bloodthirsty didn't say a word. He looked at the formation and was silent for a while before saying,""Break the formation!"It wasn't to attack, but to break the formation.A forceful attack was to destroy with brute force, while breaking a formation meant to break it with skill.At the side, Supreme Emperor Wu Hai frowned slightly.""This ... Isn't this inappropriate? These two people set up a great formation and implicated Senlan in hopes that we would give up on breaking the formation by force. Once we really fall into the formation ... We might be fooled!"It was something that anyone with eyes could see!"No worries, let's go in together!""Does he think we'll split up?" bloodthirsty asked coldly. Or enter one by one? If they dare to show their faces, they'll die! No matter how powerful the formation is, it's just this. If we all enter together, do you think they have the strength to kill all of us?"Everyone nodded and the wandering cultivators heaved a sigh of relief.They were afraid that bloodthirsty would be too arrogant and ask the wandering cultivators to break the formation.When that time came ... There might really be heavy casualties.Since they were going in together, there was no problem."Enter the formation!" Bloodthirsty shouted coldly.A group of venerable sovereigns quickly entered the formation under his lead. Bloodthirsty turned to look at Yan Fang's group and sneered,""Since we can't cut off the terrain, we'll suppress the nearby area to prevent a large number of creatures from dying in vain! Yan Fang, we don't want the last forest orchid to become a dead area. What we want is a flourishing forest orchid!"Yan Fang's expression was cold and stern, and he did not say a word.At this moment, he did not say anything.After they left, he shouted,""He's in charge of everything, and he's suppressing the earth veins! Once the formation is broken, you must suppress the turbulence, understand?""Understood!"The venerable sovereigns quickly scattered in all directions.Bloodthirsty, who had entered the array, laughed and said,""That's good. In this way, these people can only suppress the four directions, which saves us a lot of trouble. Otherwise, I'm worried that these guys won't know what's good for them and will get involved!"……Inside the formation.Li Hao glanced at it and chuckled.""The Crimson Moon people are as arrogant as ever! As always, they don't put us in their eyes. They always think that since they're from a level 8 world, they'll definitely eat us up!"Kong Ji thought carefully and looked at Li Hao seriously.""If it weren't for you and me, they would've been dead for sure! It's the same for the world of light. In a rank eight world, there are seven rank six venerable sovereigns and dozens of other venerable sovereigns. Why wouldn't they be arrogant when they're dealing with a rank four and a rank six?"“……”Li Hao was speechless.And Kong Ji felt that Li Hao was wrong.Why do they feel that they can't win against you?It was already set in stone!Well, Li Hao felt that it was still a problem of cognition. If he were from a level 8 world, he might think the same.He didn't say anything more. Instead, he looked at the people who had entered the array and smiled.""Then do it?" "Anytime!"Li Hao didn't say anything else. In an instant, the formation fluctuated, and the power of great DAOs swept over to attack the experts. The attached great DAOs appeared. Li Hao only had a shallow understanding of the attached great DAOs, so they didn't have much effect."The only effect is ...... It has a bit of my aura, the aura of time.It was that simple! This one didn't do much damage to the venerable sovereigns, and it was even easily destroyed.The sky-stealing sun-shifting technique gradually began to dissipate.Li Hao had accumulated a lot of chaos lightning tribulations.The lightning tribulation was not weak at all. It helped the sword Saint and the void to recover, turned back time to observe the origin of the world, and observed the formation of the Dao web ...At this moment, bloodthirst, who had just defeated some great Dao power, frowned slightly.He felt as if something was attached to his body.It was a very weak great Dao power.However, it was a little special. The feeling of it sticking to his body was a little inappropriate. Although this force was weak, it was very difficult to get rid of it when it stuck to his body. It was also a little uncomfortable.At the same time, the other top powerhouses also sensed something."Get rid of that special power in your body, and be a little more careful ..." Bloodthirsty said.He still gave her a reminder.Although the force was strong, it was still stuck to his body. He had to be careful.Everyone started to expel this energy, but the Dao of attachment was essentially attachment. The power of a passive great Dao could either assimilate you or be assimilated by you. Everyone used their power, and in an instant, this attachment power not only did not disappear, but was also ... Absorbed by them.Everyone was stunned. What kind of energy was this?It was actually easily absorbed and assimilated!He didn't feel like it was a big deal.He was too weak!……At the same time.Sector Lord Sen LAN was also slightly startled, a dark cloud swiftly appeared!Primal Chaos lightning tribulation.Advancement lightning tribulation?Just as he was thinking this, he carefully sensed his surroundings and heaved a sigh of relief. No, he understood. It was the Silver Moon King. It was said that once the Silver Moon King made a move, he would attract the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. It seemed to be true. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  It wasn't too powerful, probably around the fifth or sixth level of venerable sovereign power.Although Li Hao had accumulated a lot of tribulation lightning, he was only at the fourth stage. Moreover, he had been very careful and restrained himself, so he didn't attract too much tribulation lightning.It was still alright!Just as he was thinking about it, the lightning tribulation appeared extremely quickly this time.

2951 Chapter 485
Perhaps it was because it had sensed the aura of time again and again that the lightning tribulation was a little unhappy. It had clearly destroyed the other party every time, but the power of time would appear again very quickly.It was too annoying!The Tribulation lightning quickly transformed into a human figure. He held a giant hammer and instantly burrowed into the forest great world.At the same time, a seventh rank venerable sovereign was also observing from a distance.He had also noticed the lightning tribulation.However ... He didn't pay too much attention to it. It was around the fifth or sixth rank. After some slight judgment, he had some ideas. Perhaps ... It was that life and death Emperor. From the looks of it, this life and death Emperor was a little stronger than what the realmlord had said.The Dao of life and death was in a stage of fusion. It wasn't as if they hadn't fused yet.The cultivation of life and death and the fusion of life and death would trigger the chaos lightning tribulation. This was something that a high-leveled venerable sovereign naturally knew.……The people who were still trying to break the formation suddenly noticed something strange.Above his head, a figure of lightning appeared. It ignored the formation and everything else. In the next moment, it attacked indiscriminately!BOOM!A bolt of tribulation lightning appeared above everyone's head.It struck down in an instant!Without giving them any time to react, bloodthirsty's expression shifted, but he immediately relaxed. It wasn't too strong, just Primal Chaos lightning tribulation.Damn it!How did these two guys pull the lightning tribulation to them?That special power just now?He didn't have time to think anymore. A sword appeared in the Assassin's hand and he struck out. The Dao of slaughter appeared and with a loud bang, the shadow above his head was directly shattered by his sword!The power was unbelievable.It was just a mere fifth or sixth-grade lightning power!Above the heads of the others, there was also a lightning tribulation. Bloodthirsty destroyed a bolt of lightning, then turned around and slashed with his sword, destroying all the lightning tribulations above the heads of the other venerable sovereigns. The few sixth rank venerable sovereigns were relatively more relaxed.If they worked together, such a lightning tribulation would not be too difficult to deal with."Was it triggered by the Dao of life and death?"Eroding soul still had the time to say this and laughed,"The chaos lightning tribulation doesn't seem to be much. It's rumored that it's extremely powerful and won't stop until one of us dies ..."The seven sixth level venerable sovereigns were all very relaxed.Although those lower-level venerable sovereigns were in danger, with them holding the fort, the red moon venerable sovereign did not deliberately harm them. They deliberately did not deal with the lightning tribulation. In this way, everyone shared the lightning tribulation and did not suffer much damage.However, at this moment, the lightning tribulation that had been destroyed reappeared!On the other side, Li Hao was still casting time. This time, he did not conceal or shield himself. The lightning began to strike him as well. More tribulation lightning appeared. Li Hao was helping Kong Ji recover.Kong Ji continued to use his special powers to fill the formation. The Nirvana world started to slowly spread.He didn't need to recover the consumed energy by himself. Li Hao helped him recover in passing. The lightning tribulation continued to appear!Boom! Boom! Boom!The deafening noise continued. The venerable sovereigns in the formation were still relaxed. "They're also suffering from the lightning strikes. I'd like to see who will be the first to give up!" What a joke!If Li Hao hadn't been struck by lightning, they would have had to worry about him. The two of them had been attracting lightning tribulations and were in great danger, but Li Hao was also being struck by lightning!If he could even hold on at Tier 4, could they not?The group continued to destroy the lightning as they advanced towards the core.Boom! Boom! Boom!The primal Chaos lightning tribulation seemed to have been enraged as well, and it exploded with even more destructive power as it blasted toward everyone. The entire sky was covered in dark clouds!His killing speed became even faster. At this moment, he didn't care about the lightning tribulation at all and just pressed forward.With his powerful strength, he broke the array from the inside and cut down the array base.As for the other Grade 6 ones, they went to deal with the lightning tribulations.After cutting off the source, there would naturally be no lightning tribulation.He was extremely fast and had a strong combat strength.He also understood what these two people were thinking. They wanted to exhaust everyone's strength ... However, they made it sound as if only the power of their great DAOs would be exhausted.The layers of formations were quickly broken by the other party.Li Hao had no time to care about the array.At this moment, Li Hao had to face the lightning tribulation and use time to restore the silence. The formation could only be broken by the enemy. It was a buffer zone in the first place, and it was fine if it was broken.At this time, the other sixth level venerable sovereigns were getting a little impatient. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  It was fine if he had to endure his own lightning tribulation.At the moment, they had to help these low-rank venerable sovereigns, which was very troublesome."Stop looking!" Shi hun shouted,"everyone, let's work together to defeat the lightning tribulation. Even if we work together, we can't defeat it!"I brought you here to be thugs, not young masters.When the wandering cultivators heard this, they did not dare to delay and attacked one after another.The bolts of tribulation lightning were destroyed one by one!With so many venerable sovereigns joining hands, the movement was earth-shaking and their strength could not be underestimated. In the blink of an eye, a large number of Thunder tribulations were destroyed, and more Thunder Power was triggered.……"Are you done?"At this moment, Li Hao was also feeling a little uncomfortable. His skin and flesh had been split open by the Thunderbolts. Was the empty Nirvana formation ready?Kong Ji laughed and nodded.It's done!"I'll take back Shi Guang then. ""Yes."Li Hao quickly dispersed the power of time and activated the sky-stealing sun-shifting technique. The remaining void shadows of the heavenly Tribulation seemed to be angry, but without the power of time, there was no reason for the heavenly Tribulation to continue existing.The last wave of tribulation lightning struck down, and in the blink of an eye, it was shattered by all sides. Very quickly, the Tribulation lightning completely dissipated.

The members of bloodthirsty force smiled.It was useless!At this time, these two were just lambs waiting to be slaughtered. Only the last few layers of the array were still intact, and they were about to be completely destroyed."I'm a little excited ..."At this moment, Kong Ji laughed and looked at Li Hao.""You, move away!"Li Hao retreated naturally.This young master Kong Ji is about to flip out. I'll just watch."Rise!"With a low growl, the entire area turned dark as a destructive force filled the entire area!The entire area fell silent.Even heaven and earth seemed to have been destroyed!"Die!"The power of death instantly erupted.Bloodthirsty's expression changed slightly. With a low shout, he slashed the world with his sword. A trace of doubt appeared in his eyes. This was ... The power of Nirvana?Was it?It was said that the son of the God of Light, Ming Tang, seemed to have given up on the path of light and turned to cultivate the power of Nirvana ...As soon as this thought emerged, a small flower suddenly appeared in the world. It was extremely weak, and in this dark world, it was so small that it was invisible."Revive!" Kong Ji chuckled.The world began to recover, and the flowers began to bloom, but they lacked enough vitality. At this moment, the Dao of life erupted. In an instant, an extremely violent power that absorbed vitality filled the entire realm! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The Nirvana world appeared instantly and enveloped everyone.Bloodthirsty's group felt their vitality being taken. Bloodthirsty's face turned cold as he hissed,""Kill him!"The seven sixth level venerable sovereigns attacked at the same time!BOOM!The whole world trembled violently in an instant, and the low-rank venerable sovereigns screamed in pain. The power of Quietus had made their bodies a little sluggish. The power of recovery and the power of vitality fused, extracting their vitality to make up for the lack of the power of recovery.At the same time, a star appeared in Li Hao's hand again, but this time, there was no lightning.He had blocked it again.The entire realm seemed to have accelerated time!His life force, which had been flowing away at a slow speed, was rapidly flowing away at this moment!A first-stage venerable sovereign was able to hold on at first, but suddenly, his expression changed and he revealed a look of horror. Venerable sovereigns were almost immortal, but at this moment, his body was visibly aging!An aura of decay emerged from his body in the blink of an eye, and a large amount of life force was extracted in an instant!A middle-stage venerable sovereign could still resist for a while.However, they were all low-rank venerable sovereigns, and in the blink of an eye, the first-rank venerable sovereign screamed in fear and weakness when he was faced with the combination of Li Hao and Kong Ji."I ... I ..." It was almost an instant!The other party's physical body began to age, decay, and finally turn into dust. At this moment, his physical body directly rotted to the point of collapse.His Dao marks appeared, while the lone cultivator's Dao marks were filled with impurities.The life force in these Dao marks was also rapidly flowing away. Cracks started to appear on his Dao marks.The surrounding venerable sovereigns were all shocked by this scene!How could this be?A venerable sovereign could live for at least a million years. In the end, in just a short while, his life force had been sucked dry, and even his Dao marks could not resist it. Before he even fought with the venerable sovereign, his life force had been sucked dry!Li Hao's expression changed slightly. Life and death combined with Nirvana resuscitation was very powerful!In addition to his own time acceleration, it only took a short while for this rank one to be completely selected!In the center of the realm, beside Kong Ji, the small flower seemed to be growing. It was full of vitality. This was the vitality that was extracted to help the flower bloom!BOOM!As the bloodthirsty sword broke through the last layer of the array, there was a loud bang. The Dao marks of the first stage venerable sovereign who had his life force sucked out shattered directly and he died completely!The death of a rank one was nothing.And he was a rogue cultivator!However, one venerable sovereign had died before they had even had a direct confrontation. This made the other venerable sovereigns, who were still losing their lives, very anxious and uneasy!How could this be?"You're looking for death!""Kill them!" Bloodthirsty shouted coldly,"we'll naturally break the world of Nirvana!"He could tell that this person ... Could really be the Son of God of light.He was absorbing the venerable sovereigns 'vitality and nurturing the flower.Damn bastard!Kong Ji laughed. Before the other party came, he suddenly whispered,""Revival of Nirvana, Nirvana ... It's not the Nirvana world, but ... Great destruction!"In just an instant, The Dark World of destruction suddenly erupted!The entire realm collapsed instantly!Countless destructive forces instantly rippled in all directions, and a force of death permeated the air. Under the great destruction, there would be death. Without pure destructive power, there would always be death!Only when death and Nirvana co-exist together can it be true destruction!Boom! Boom! Boom!Darkness descended, and the entire world turned dark. It was as if the entire Senlan had been pulled into darkness, and one could not even see their own fingers!It was dark!The power of darkness.Kong Ji said that he studied the six paths, and among them, there were light and darkness."It's you indeed!"At this moment, a bloodthirsty voice rang out. With a low roar, a long sword silently charged straight at Kong Ji!As expected, it was the son of the God of Light!But ... So what?Since this person dared to cause trouble in the red moon, he would be killed without hesitation!In the darkness, many low-stage venerable sovereigns screamed in pain. Some of them were deprived of their vitality, while others were covered by death. They were severely injured in an instant and their vitality was devoured in the next moment!

2953 Chapter 485
The small flower in front of the empty space was the only source of light. At this moment, it was swaying and seemed particularly lively.Under the eyes of seven level six venerable sovereigns, he had killed many low level venerable sovereigns in an instant.The venerable sovereigns screamed in the dark and began to disappear.Someone seemed to have recognized Kong Ji. He screamed in despair,""It's him ... It's the Son of God of light ..."Destructive power, dark power ... Rank 6 venerable sovereign!Who else could this person be but the Son of God of light?At the same time, six red moons appeared in the sky, illuminating the entire dark world. They were filled with intense anger, despair, madness, bloodlust, and charm ...In an instant, the entire realm was turned into a Red Moon domain! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The six Red Moon sovereigns joined hands and covered the darkness, even revealing the red moon's Dao domain!It instantly covered the entire Nirvana world!Six of the seven venerable sovereigns charged at Kong Ji. Yu Xiu hesitated. He recognized Kong Ji and was a little apprehensive. He didn't dare to kill him, but he gritted his teeth and charged at Li Hao.He didn't dare to kill Kong Ji. Six tier 6 experts were enough. He would deal with Li Hao!Li Hao, on the other hand, was still activating the star in his hand.Those wandering cultivators died very quickly, and it had a lot to do with him.The acceleration of time had accelerated the loss of these people's life force by hundreds or even thousands of times. This was the key to these venerable sovereigns 'rapid death. He had already sensed that seven or eight low-rank venerable sovereigns had died here.Li Hao smiled as he watched the rank six venerable sovereign charge at him. He then dissipated the time in his hand.He no longer activated the power of time.At this moment, a sword appeared in Li Hao's hand. He gently slashed out, and in an instant, Dao domains appeared one after another and stacked in all directions. In an instant, Yu Xiu seemed to have fallen into a quagmire!It was as if he had been enveloped by countless worlds. His expression changed slightly, and with a roar, he punched out, wanting to break this world.At this moment, the five elements appeared, and water and fire blended!It was difficult for Li Hao to deal with a level 6 individual cultivator from a great world, but was a level 6 individual cultivator really that strong?After all, he was a true level four venerable sovereign who wielded the river of Dao, the myriad DAOs, and the monarch weapons. Not everyone was a sword venerable!The power of the long river emerged, and the waves surged!"Destroy!"A low shout, BOOM!Heaven and earth collapsed as if the world was being destroyed. Li Hao didn't care about Kong Ji. He wanted to see how strong this level six itinerant cultivator was!The long sword slashed out once again. It contained the power of 10000 DAOs and finally turned into the Nirvana sword!The sword was drawn!A Nirvana sword light appeared in the entire world. The sword slashed down. BOOM!The power of great DAOs collided!Li Hao was pushed back. His body began to crack from the impact, while Yu Xiu's face changed. A bloody mark appeared on his fist and spread rapidly. Destructive power burst out, and his fist was shattered by the destructive power! The surroundings fell silent for a moment.Li Hao seemed to be at a disadvantage in the fight between a Tier 4 and a Tier 6, but ... The unparalleled existence among the unaffiliated cultivators had his fist shattered by the opponent's sword!"Silver Moon King!"At this moment, Yu Xiu seemed to have made a judgment, and his expression changed.He already knew the identities of these two people.One was the Silver Moon King, and the other ... Was the Son of God of light!No wonder they were so terrifying.He, a Tier 6, actually suffered a bit of a loss at the hands of a Tier 4.Li Hao, however, wasn't very satisfied. He frowned.It was true that he was a Tier 4, but the other party was only a rogue cultivator!Not to mention that he could run amuck among the Rogue cultivators, but he had planned for so long and used all his means. Other than not using time on this person, the seemingly casual sword was already his full strength.In the end, he only injured his opponent and shattered his fist.He couldn't even kill the weakest Tier 6!He was not being arrogant, but he was aiming at an expert like venerable sword. He should be invincible among experts of the same level from the macro world. He should have even fought against a fifth level venerable sovereign from the macro world and could have fought against a sixth level individual cultivator!It was usually very troublesome for him to kill people. He wasn't as straightforward as the human King and the others, because the people Li Hao met were all strong.But ... It still didn't feel good.I can't even kill a rank six cultivator, isn't that too embarrassing?On the other side, the void had already exploded. The powerful light power had instantly burst out. The fusion of six Dao was the Dao of two extremes. In an instant, the six Dao swept across the world. Even bloodthirsty was shocked!Li Hao glanced at Yu Xiu again. Although he and Kong Ji didn't expect the two of them to kill all of them, they had to kill all the venerable sovereigns except Hong Yue to show that they had the ability to plan!Instead, he could only hope that the sword venerable could kill Wushuang with one strike!In that case, venerable the sword alone would be enough. What was the use of having them?"I have a move. Fellow Daoist is the first person to try it. How about you give it a try?"Li Hao exploded when he was asked.At this moment, realm After Realm appeared and rapidly combined to form a realm net, a Dao net!The Dao net appeared!Yu Xiu's expression changed slightly. He quickly returned to his fist and punched at Li Hao. Li Hao, however, condensed time. In the blink of an eye, his speed increased. The 360 worlds merged into the river, and the river merged into the sword.The longsword was made of bone. When Li Hao activated it, a crack even appeared on the longsword.A powerful force instantly burst out.A thousand swords!A thousand DAOs transformed into a sword, with domain as the Dao and the river as the foundation.

"Slash!"BOOM!In the void, a huge net appeared and directly enveloped Yu Xiu. Yu Xiu's expression changed slightly, and he threw a punch. BOOM!However, the net fell quickly. His opponent's punch failed to shatter the net. Although Li Hao vomited blood, he smiled and slashed out with his sword, releasing a suppressive force!BOOM!The loud sound suppressed everything at this moment. Everyone could not help but look out of the corner of their eyes and was slightly shocked!Rogue cultivators and cultivators were directly cut in half by this sword!The two halves of his body began to heal rapidly!Yu Xiu's eyes were filled with intense shock.Was this person ... Really only at the fourth rank?He was overwhelmed with shock, disbelief, and jealousy. How was this possible? even a fourth stage venerable sovereign from a macro world couldn't be so powerful. At that moment, he felt as if he had been suppressed by thousands of DAOs!It was as if he was being suppressed by the world Lord. However, in this place, even if the other party was the Silver Moon King, he didn't have the Silver Moon world. How could he suppress me for an instant?However ... He can't kill me with just one strike!As soon as he had this thought, Li Hao's expression turned ugly. One sword attack wasn't enough!He could compete with a rank six individual cultivator and even gain the upper hand, but ... He could not kill his opponent, just like how Sword Saint could not kill a rank seven individual cultivator.However, that was the sword Saint.I'm not the sword Saint!He was slightly annoyed. In just a moment, the energy that had just been consumed was suddenly restored. Yu Xiu, who was still recovering, suddenly collapsed again. The long sword in Li Hao's hand reappeared. He shouted,""Slash!"BOOM!The second sword was even faster than the first. In just an instant, it slashed down with a loud boom!Bang! Bang!Half of Yu Xiu was turned into ashes by Li Hao, but Li Hao's energy was used up again. His face grew uglier. Three or four sword strikes!Yes, he had a basic judgment.It would take at least three to four strikes to kill a sixth step cultivator, which was similar to a revered Sword Master.The remaining half of Yu Xiu turned pale with fright and roared,""Bloodthirsty venerable sovereign ..."He had actually suffered a great loss at the hands of a 4th rank.If the other party were to do it one or two more times, he might really die. This was too terrifying.At this moment, how could he care about his face? what face could be more important than his life?He didn't need to Shout! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  In fact, one of the six venerable sovereigns who were killing Kong Ji had secretly come over. He was so shocked that he appeared behind Li Hao without thinking, and his huge palm went straight for Li Hao's head!The Silver Moon King!This guy was also so heaven-defying, a rank four against a rank six. Even if rogue cultivators were not valued by everyone, they were still rank six, and he was almost killed by him!An extremely powerful Crimson Moon Power erupted from his palm.Go to hell!At this moment, they couldn't care about leaving him alive. This person had the power to kill a Grade 6 expert, so they couldn't leave him alive!The two tier 6 experts attacked, one in front and one behind. Half of Yu Xiu's body disappeared completely. Seeing this, he didn't care about anything else, only fear and anger. He punched Li Hao with his remaining fist!Kill him!Otherwise, he might have lived in the shadows for the rest of his life. He was almost killed by a 4th rank, this was the shame of his life!……In the darkness.Venerable the sword was ready to make his move. He felt that the two of them had done a good job, better than expected.He could make a move now!First, they killed the two tier 6 experts beside Li Hao, and then they joined forces to kill the others ...The opportunity had arrived!Just as the sword Saint was about to make his move, he suddenly stopped and suppressed the fluctuations. His eyes changed slightly and revealed a look of surprise."Where the Dao is, all laws are annihilated!"Li Hao murmured, and divine runes appeared in the void. The divine runes combined and turned into a huge Dao domain in an instant. The domains were connected, and different great Dao fluctuations emerged. In an instant, a huge star suddenly emerged.Life and death!The Dao domains connected, and the destruction spread. All laws were destroyed!The power of the red moon dissipated in an instant. The rank six venerable sovereign who had launched the sneak attack was shocked.And these connected Tao regions seemed to have turned into a book. This was the scene that surprised revered sword ... The book of Dao?Old Zhang had imparted his Dao?No, Zhang an? But how could Zhang an, that little fool, preach to Li Hao?The huge page appeared, and in an instant, it suppressed all techniques. A large saber suddenly appeared in Li Hao's hand. In an instant, it was as if he had been possessed by a human King, and his saber attack was extremely violent!"Die!"BOOM!Yu Xiu was shocked. Half of his body was directly shattered by the blade. The Dao mark had just appeared when the book of Dao pressed down with a bang. The Dao mark was directly crushed by the book of Dao and turned into light sources, which integrated into each small domain!He was dead!Behind him, Red Moon sovereign was also shocked. The power of the red moon emerged again, broke through Li Hao's suppression, and was about to press down on Li Hao's head!Just as venerable the sword was about to attack, Li Hao shouted,""That way!"Sword Saint understood and didn't waste any time. He turned around and swung his sword at bloodthirsty and the others.Li Hao didn't seem to need any help!This guy, unexpectedly, actually killed a Tier 6, and from the looks of it, he wanted to fight with the Tier 6 of the great world ...Of the seven level six venerable sovereigns, the first to be killed was an itinerant cultivator ... It was normal, but it was not normal for Li Hao to kill him.At this moment, a sword light shot out from the sky!Venerable sword made his move, and his powerful sword intent immediately destroyed the darkness. Kong Ji was somewhat depressed. Damn it, Haoyue had gotten there first, and he was somewhat disappointed.The sword was drawn!Sky-splitting!BOOM!Eroding soul looked to the side and his soul scattered. He slashed down with his sword like a Grade 7 sneak attack. Looking down, his body was completely shattered. The Dao marks of the red moon appeared and in an instant, the Dao marks were shattered!The Soul Eater's consciousness was still a little confused. Am I ... Dead?In just an instant, he seemed to have been killed.He thought that he would be able to relax a little if he was on the outskirts, but in the end ... He was the first one to be killed!No, Yu Xiu died earlier than me.But ... Yu Xiu, a wandering cultivator, what was he?I can become a seventh-rank venerable sovereign of a great world!With his last thought, the sword light obliterated all his thoughts. I'm dead!BOOM!At this moment, the sound of an explosion reverberated throughout the world.The entire world was completely lit up.When the darkness had descended, it was now gone. The Nirvana world was gone. The Senlan monarch, who had been suppressed outside, hadn't sensed anything before, but when he looked again, he was stunned.Two sixth-level venerable sovereigns and seven to eight lower-level venerable sovereigns were gone. In the blink of an eye, ten venerable sovereigns were gone!"Sword Saint!"Bloodthirsty's loud shout woke everyone up.It was the sword Saint!New martial!With a sneak attack, he had killed a rank six. It was unbelievably fast.In the blink of an eye, two tier 6 experts had died."Fall!"The sword domain appeared instantly, and thousands of swords descended. At the same time, Li Hao and Kong Ji also unleashed their domains at the same time!Nihilum zone, myriad Dao zone, sword Dao zone!The three regions merged and stacked together.Suppressing the heavens and earth!The entire forest instantly became sluggish. Then, the sword venerable waved his sword again and slashed down. BOOM!With another loud noise, a rank 6 Red Moon sovereign was instantly killed!BOOM! Another blood-red sword came and broke the suppression force with a bang. In an instant, the remaining three venerable sovereigns retreated. The level six venerable sovereign who was fighting Li Hao was also horrified and frantically retreated!In the blink of an eye, three of them had died!As bloodthirsty retreated, he roared. The power of the Crimson Moon shook the heavens and the earth. A great path universe seemed to be about to descend. With disbelief, he roared,""Sword Saint, Silver Moon King, and bright Hall!"It was them!The death of the awakening God Emperor was related to these people!All of this happened too quickly. Everyone was stunned. In an instant, two rank six experts were killed by the sword Saint. Were they ... Still rank six?It was unbelievable!

Chapter 2955 The Plan Is Completed_ 1
(It's the last day of the month. If you have a monthly vote, please vote after 12 o' clock.)There was an unforeseen event!At the same time, when two of Hong Yue's sixth level venerable sovereigns died, it only took a moment. However, the seventh level venerable sovereign outside of Hong Yue noticed it.The situation had changed too quickly!In other words, the sword Saint was too powerful. He killed two of them in an instant.The fluctuation of the great Dao had spread from the Crimson Moon universe ... And that person had sensed it.This was the unforeseen event that the realm Lord was talking about!The seventh level venerable sovereign who was hiding in the dark didn't even think. At this moment, he had no other thoughts in his mind. He only had one thought in his mind. Sen LAN was too audacious. Damn it, did sector Lord Sen LAN act?Otherwise, how could two tier 6 martial artists have been killed so quickly under bloodthirsty's nose?His aura was revealed!It was extremely powerful!The pressure of a Grade 7 expert instantly shook the chaos!Sector Lord Sen LAN was originally on guard against the arrival of Red Moon master. When he sensed her aura, he was stunned.Venerable sovereign AI Hong?How could it be him!Furthermore, the other party had actually followed them!The first thing he felt was shock and fear. The seventh-rank was here ... The next moment, he was stunned. The seventh-rank was here!Then ... Wouldn't the Crimson Moon world only have a rank eight Crimson Moon Lord?Did ... Did this mean that the red moon master would not appear?Otherwise, if a level Seven left and a level eight left ... The red moon would become an undefended great world. As for the low-and mid-stage venerable sovereigns in the realm, they were not worth mentioning to a great world!Therefore, it was only a momentary shock, but very quickly, he felt a sense of joy!Rank 7 Supreme Emperor Ai Hong!His opponent's aura was powerful, and his speed was shocking. In the blink of an eye, he was heading toward the world gate. Clearly, he had sensed something.At the same time.A great Dao suddenly rippled in the forest orchid realm. Outside, a powerful being appeared. He wore a crown and seemed to have a star between his brows. This was the mark of many great Dao Masters. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The man appeared in an instant and looked at the incoming AI Hong Supreme Emperor. His voice was like a great Bell."AI Hong sovereign, what are you doing?""Move!" He shouted.Not him?The AI Hong Thearch was also slightly taken aback.It wasn't sector Lord Sen LAN!Who was that?Or could it be that this person killed the two soul devourers and came out again ...No matter what, he had to go in and take a look. The original cracks had all been filled up, and now, the only way in and out was through the realm gate.His incomparably powerful aura instantly spread out!The entire world seemed to be shaking. And at this moment, sector Lord Sen Lan's aura also trembled. His peak level 6 strength surged out. Above his head, there seemed to be a great Dao universe floating.Beneath his feet, the world Energy of the forest orchid realm was gathering!Near the realm gate, dozens of venerable sovereigns were waiting in formation. Some of them looked scared, while some were gritting their teeth!This ... Was the Crimson Moon going to invade by force?"Move!" He shouted.AI Hong hollered,"you know better than me what's happening. Sector Lord Sen LAN, don't make a mistake!"Such courage!At this moment, the Senlan realm Lord didn't say a word. He was absorbing the great DAOs of the three dead venerable sovereigns, including the low-level venerable sovereigns. He didn't leave Li Hao and the others behind. This time, it was for him to vindicate grade seven Dao. He had to say that these people kept their promises and were terrifyingly powerful.That Silver Moon King could actually kill a rank 6!However ... He was still lacking.The forest orchid realm Lord was clear that he was still lacking a bit. He would need to kill at least one more Stage 6 expert. At the very least, he would need to kill one more or even two more because Yu Xiu's DAOs were too chaotic. They weren't as pure as the Crimson Moon's DAOs. It was the same for those rogue cultivators.After swiftly calculating all of this, the forest orchid sector Lord said solemnly,""I know what happened. I'm also dealing with it and preparing to suppress those people ... But sovereign AI Hong can't enter. This is the forest orchid realm. If even seventh level venerable sovereigns can enter, once they attack our world from the inside, Senlan will definitely die!""If sovereign AI Hong wants to enter now, it means ... He's forcing me to fight to the death!" He thought.His eyes were cold and sharp, with a hint of madness."I can ask venerable sovereign Sen LAN to take action as soon as possible and suppress those lunatics who are killing the red moon. However, venerable sovereign AI Hong is not allowed to enter!"AI Hong looked at him coldly. The realm Lord had said that at the critical moment, he should kill this guy!Sector Lord Sen LAN, he really thought he was something.At this moment, two sixth level venerable sovereigns had died. Was he still in the mood to wait for him to make arrangements?"Get lost!""I'll give you one last chance," sovereign AI Hong shouted."If you don't get out of my way, I'll kill you today!" I'll let you know that not all the Lords of a major cosmos are worthy of being called the Lords of a major cosmos!"The difference between tier 7 and Tier 6 is far greater than you imagine!Sector Lord Sen LAN also went all out!Anyway, the Lord of the Crimson Moon would not come out now. The rank seven had come, which meant that he was much more stable than before. Once he came out ... It meant that he was ready to give up the Crimson Moon.Since that's the case, what am I afraid of?Sector Lord Sen LAN cursed madly in his heart!In the next moment, within the realm, monarch Senlan's voice resounded in the minds of all those present, including Yan Fang and the others.""Let's join hands with revered sword and the others to kill all the other venerable sovereigns! Faster!"At this moment, he couldn't bear it anymore!In order to reach the seventh rank, even if he had to risk his life, he would not let AI Hong ruin his good plan.In the realm, the hearts of the Senlan Thearch trembled. The next moment, Yan Fang led a group of people and charged toward the battlefield without a word.Outside the world, the Sen LAN realm Lord hollered in rage. His voice was like a huge Bell, shaking the primal Chaos,""You, Red Moon, are you sure you can beat me? Do you have to invade my forest world? I, Sen LAN, came to the Alliance with sincerity, but not only did you not protect me, you even wanted to devour me. Who in the chaotic world would dare to vote for you?"

Chapter 2956 The Plan Is Completed_ 2
His voice reverberated in the chaos, and his angry roar resounded through the world!Since they had already fallen out, he would give Hong Yue a bad name first!As soon as he finished speaking, his aura skyrocketed. Although he didn't reach Level Seven, he was at the top level six. The great path universe appeared directly. He gritted his teeth and said,""Then let's fight! I'm still a little afraid of the red moon sovereign, but Who Do You Think You Are, AI Hong?""Bastard!"The AI Hong Thearch was furious. The people of the forest orchid realm were crazy!He didn't say anything more. The realmlord had given the order that if anything happened, he would attack immediately.BOOM!A Red Moon appeared between heaven and earth, like a realm. The Dao domain appeared and pressed down. For a moment, countless wails seemed to be heard from the Dao domain.Wailing birds filled the field!This was the origin of his Daoist name. At this moment, it was as if there were thousands of dead souls emerging in his Dao domain. All of them were screaming miserably. Countless dead souls gathered together and wailed!Boom! Boom! Boom!The great Dao universe trembled violently. The power of the Crimson Moon swept over. Even sector Lord Sen LAN seemed to feel the invasion of the great Dao. For a moment, his emotions changed. In the next instant, he roared!All encompassing!The domain of the great Dao, which was like hell, appeared. For a moment, a dense Qi emerged in hell. Together with the wails from the other side, it seemed to have completely formed a hell!"You really dare to attack!"AI Hong shouted coldly. The red moon above her head charged at the other party!You're looking for death!……At the same time.The moment the battle erupted.In the red moon realm.The red moon Lord's eyes were cold. Without saying a word, she merged her mind with the great Dao, and her will quietly appeared above AI Hong. However, she did not descend, but instead observed her surroundings.What about neo martial?Aihong was the backup, but she was also a target!He wanted to see if neo martial was nearby!"A level Seven appeared. He's also the last level Seven of my Red Moon. If a neo martial artist is nearby, perhaps ... He'll be tempted to attack Ai Hong.As for the internal turmoil in Senlan and the death of two stage six experts ... At this moment, he actually didn't care. It didn't matter.He must determine the whereabouts of neo martial!Otherwise, he would not be able to eat or sleep in peace.Today, as long as neo martial appeared ... As long as Zhi Zun, yang God, Emperor Cang, and the others appeared, he would immediately take action and descend. No matter what, he had to defeat or drive neo martial away!He couldn't let them hide around here anymore. If they did, the red moon would be in a passive position.He observed silently and didn't reveal anything. AI Hong, I hope you can lure out those bastards!"Also, Senlan realm Lord seems to be reaching the seventh rank soon. He's not weak and can actually block AI Hong. Although this is Senlan's native land, AI Hong is a seventh rank venerable sovereign of a great world. She's not much weaker than an ordinary seventh rank absolute being of a great world.The other party was able to block it ... It seemed like he was also planning to enter the seventh step.No wonder he was unwilling to surrender!Of course, he couldn't care about this guy now. If the neo martial artists didn't appear, he would be too uncomfortable. He couldn't sleep and eat in peace. All his anger and loss of control were directed at that group of bastards.……Within the realm.The sword Saint appeared and killed the two emperors in an instant. Before they could continue fighting, the entire world shook and the power of the world was drawn away.His roar resounded through the heavens and earth!In an instant, the bloodthirsty cultivators 'eyes lit up. The AI Hong Supreme Emperor was here!Rank 7 venerable sovereign!Just as he rejoiced, he felt the shockwaves from the battle. Sector Lord Sen LAN was like a Mantis trying to stop a chariot, he actually dared to stop him!Bastard!Just as he was thinking about it, in the next moment, several Senlan venerable sovereigns suddenly appeared on the outside. Yan Fang didn't say anything and directly attacked the low-level venerable sovereigns on the outside. This person was also holding back!He attacked instantly, and the power of his great Dao erupted like the netherworld. A netherworld aura exploded, and with a boom, a venerable sovereign who had lost a large amount of life force was instantly killed!"Kill them all!"With a loud shout, many venerable sovereigns Senlan took advantage of the geographical advantage and the People's support. They took advantage of the fact that most of the Rogue cultivators 'vitality had been devoured and attacked at the same time!Boom! Boom! Boom!A great battle instantly erupted. Ji Hao and the others were extremely ruthless!They were all from the sector Lord's bloodline, and they wanted sector Lord Sen LAN to reach the 7th level more than anyone else.With the addition of Senlan and the other venerable sovereigns, in just a moment, the screams outside were endless. These people were first attacked by lightning, then resurrected by Nirvana, and then a large amount of vitality was extracted. They were already extremely weak.Right now, Sen Lan's group of people were all extremely aggrieved and had started to vent their anger. There was even a Tier 6 expert holding the fort.In the blink of an eye, four or five low-stage venerable sovereigns were killed on the spot!In addition to the previous deaths, the number of itinerant cultivators had been reduced by half.Yan Fang did not say anything. He abandoned his opponent and ran straight to the core area. The few people from bloodthirsty sect were shocked. Red Moon only had four stage six experts left. Venerable the sword, solitary void, Yan Fang, and Li Hao were four against four!Were there any other Grade 6 experts in the realm?They didn't know, but at this moment, bloodthirsty couldn't care about the Crimson Moon's dignity anymore. He roared,""Are there any more hidden Dao friends? If you don't act now, Senlan will definitely slaughter you all when we die in battle!" He didn't believe that the only person who had entered the forest orchid this time was a rogue cultivator, Yu Xiu! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  There was definitely someone else!Previously, he was confident that six Red Moon sovereigns would be enough to sweep across the world. Therefore, he did not care about those hidden guys at all. Even if there were six more, so what?"Is there really no one else?" bloodthirsty shouted again. Do you think you can escape?"

Chapter 2957 The Plan Is Completed_ 3
Venerable the sword didn't care and directly attacked!The sword Qi rushed into the sky!Kill first!4v4. Even if Li Hao had some difficulty dealing with one of them ... It was enough. It was much better than he had expected. He had wanted to fight four or five by himself, but now ... It was one on one!He directly challenged bloodthirsty!As for Kong Ji, he was also a little annoyed. Although he didn't show it on the surface, he was furious in his heart. I, Kong Ji, didn't kill a single stage six expert, and even Li Hao took the lead. Whether he was a wandering cultivator or not, he was still a stage six.This will make me look useless, okay?In an instant, the Nirvana world appeared once again, enveloping the 2 Type 6 experts. He hollered at Yan Fang,"Go help Haoyue!"Don't come to my place!I, the deity, will fight two people today!Yan Fang was stunned, but he didn't say anything. He went straight to Li Hao. Since the Son of God of light wanted to save face and insisted on fighting two people by himself ... He would let him fight two people by himself. Yan Fang was also a top-notch venerable sovereign of Senlan, and he was fighting in his own territory. His combat strength was not weak.Before he even arrived, a dark arrow whizzed toward the level six venerable sovereign Li Hao was fighting!A powerful aura swept in all directions."Kill!"A great battle instantly erupted.However, the most miserable one was bloodthirsty, who was at the peak of the sixth rank. Both of them were at the peak of the sixth rank, and both of them used swords. However, in just one exchange, bloodthirsty's arm was cut off with a loud bang!It was too terrifying!The sword of the sword venerable was extremely powerful. With just one exchange, he had fallen into a disadvantage. The peak rank six of the macro world seemed to be of no use, but the sword venerable was somewhat dissatisfied.Damn it, he's not weak!Not only did he fail to kill his opponent, but he also only cut off one of his arms. To venerable the sword, this showed that he was somewhat incompetent.Li Hao can fight a Tier 6 opponent, and loneliness can fight two opponents at the same time. I ... I killed two of them in a surprise attack, but I can't even kill one of them in a head-on battle. This will make me look incompetent!For a moment, the three of them had the same thought.If this continued, he would appear very useless.How embarrassing!In his rage, Kong Ji was also determined. He had consumed a lot of energy, but seeing that venerable the sword was still full of energy, he suddenly gritted his teeth and looked at venerable the sword, then at Li Hao ... Feeling a little guilty.But in an instant, he made a decision.A small flower in front of him appeared at the side of his mouth. The next moment, he opened his mouth and the flower disappeared.He said it was for venerable the sword to consume ...But at this moment, he was thinking that at worst, Li Hao could turn back time once. Although the price would be higher ... It wasn't as if Li Hao hadn't experienced an even more brutal lightning tribulation. What did it matter?But today, if I don't kill a Tier 6, I feel that I can't get over this in my heart!In just an instant, his aura had returned to its peak. "Nirvana!"With a loud roar, the refined Divine Son seemed to have gone mad. He pointed his finger out, and the void exploded. The power of destruction covered the entire area, and the two rank six venerable sovereigns were completely enveloped by the power of destruction!After a slight pause, Kong Ji seized the opportunity. The next moment, when everyone thought he was going to kill, a medium world suddenly appeared in his hand. The world suddenly enveloped the two of them. Under their shocked eyes, BOOM!The world exploded! However, everything was enveloped by the Nirvana world. In an instant, the world was destroyed!Li Hao tilted his head and looked ... F * ck!What are you doing?Not only did he eat the flower, but he also blew up the world. The second generation should not be so wasteful.Just as he was thinking, something appeared in Kong Ji's hand. A powerful light power appeared on his body. His light power had almost completely dissipated, but at this moment, it was restored.The powerful power of light covered the entire world in an instant.The next moment, a Dark Sun appeared!The fusion of light and darkness!In the Nirvana realm, the two red Moon Supreme emperors had just experienced a great Nirvana and were seriously injured. The next moment, light and darkness merged and exploded silently, engulfing them!In the blink of an eye, more than half of the power of the great Dao in their bodies was consumed. They forcibly erupted and barely blocked it. However, both of them were injured by the great Dao, and their eyes were filled with horror!A grade 8 child was indeed strong.Kong Ji had also consumed a lot of energy. At this moment, the power of death surged out. He pointed out with the Finger of Death, and the Nirvana world exploded with a loud boom. The bodies of the two stage six experts exploded, and death swept through them!However ... A level six in a great world was indeed more powerful. He just didn't die!Kong Ji was about to go crazy!He's still not dead?If he didn't die, the sword Saint would kill him and take his head!He had even eaten the flower that he had left for venerable the sword, but he still hadn't killed the other party. This was too embarrassing. Even a rich second-generation would want to keep his face, especially in front of people like Li Hao and venerable the sword. He couldn't be weaker than them!"Six paths of reincarnation!"With a furious roar, he no longer cared if his six paths were still incomplete. These six paths were his main six paths.Light and darkness appeared.The six paths of reincarnation!A long river faintly appeared. Although it was not the true long river of the great path, it still had some of the meaning of a long river. Within it, silence, death, and darkness instantly enveloped the other party. In just an instant, the two of them were reduced to bones!Kong Ji's face was also pale, but he didn't care about this. He shouted,""Reincarnation!"BOOM!Their DAOs seemed to have been cut off in an instant. From bones, they entered a state of Nirvana and death. It was difficult to resist. In just an instant, the two sixth rank venerable sovereigns turned into babies at the same time ...

Their eyes were a little dazed. The next moment, countless life forces were extracted and the light in their eyes gradually disappeared. Light suddenly enveloped them and a huge sun appeared, as warm as a mother's womb.The two rank 6s seemed to melt instantly under the sunlight. Gradually, they turned into a pool of thick water!The great Dao Dao Dao marks exploded in an instant!Kong Ji panted heavily and instantly straightened his back. He looked around with a proud expression!I, Kong Ji, am not a nameless person!Today, Li Hao, a stage 4, fought a Stage 6, and sword venerable killed a Stage 6 with one strike. I, Kong Ji, will kill them both!However, no one paid any attention to his posture.He didn't have time to pay attention!At this moment, Sword Saint slashed down with his sword. With a loud bang, the body of the slaughter Emperor exploded. Sword Saint roared in anger,"Duan Changsheng!"F * ck, he had no face!He didn't look, but he could feel it. Kong Ji had killed two tier 6 martial artists, but he still couldn't kill bloodthirsty. How embarrassing.One sword to end immortality!BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the heavens and earth. Bloodthirsty screamed in pain and with a boom, he was directly slashed into pieces. The moment the Dao mark of the great path appeared, it was destroyed by the sword will.At the same time.Li Hao's expression was also solemn. As if thousands of worlds were revolving around him, the book of Dao appeared, and the longsword in his hand transformed into a long river of Dao."Please enter my myriad Dao River. Time will never return!"Time appeared and the universe was reversed!The river solidified, and the world shook!There was no need to use time, and he could wait for a while, but ... Who didn't want to save face?Neither Kong Ji nor revered sword showed any respect for killing a level six itinerant cultivator. It felt like ... He was showing off. Li Hao felt very embarrassed. Who didn't have some trump cards in this day and age?The stars of time appeared! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  The world was frozen. The rank six venerable sovereign seemed to be stunned for a moment. He was swept into the long river and suppressed by thousands of worlds. The great Dao appeared like a chain. Thousands of worlds suppressed and in the next moment, the realms were pulled!BOOM!The sixth level venerable sovereign's body was torn to pieces. Just as Li Hao was about to attack, a loud boom was heard!Yan Fang's palm struck out with a myriad of phenomena, like hell. A loud rumbling sound erupted, and the red moon was crushed into pieces!"Yan Fang!"At this moment, Li Hao shouted angrily, somewhat annoyed!Yan Fang was startled. He turned his head to look ... In the next moment, he felt a little embarrassed. He had arrived just in time to see the other party's body being blown to pieces by Li Hao. Since he had arrived, he naturally took advantage of the situation and didn't think too much.But ... Looking at Li Hao again, from his tone, he knew that he seemed to have ... Seemed to have done something bad. He had stolen the head of this genius of the sixth step.Not far away, Kong Ji heaved a sigh of relief and suddenly smiled.Good!Yan Fang did it beautifully. Otherwise ... Li Hao would have two stage six powerhouses in his hands. Now, hahaha, two for me, one for him, and three for the venerable sword ... This was in line with the order.On the other side, venerable the sword also heaved a sigh of relief.艹!,m He had almost lost face in front of these juniors. Fortunately, the Tier 4 Li Hao didn't really get a second kill ... Although it was more or less killed by this guy, it wasn 't!In just a few short moments, as Yan Fang entered the battlefield, in just a moment, he had killed a Tier 6 expert ... At least, that was what it looked like in the eyes of others.In an instant ... The seven Level 6 martial artists were all killed!In the forest orchid world, in the distance, there seemed to be a fluctuation of several auras. Those who had wanted to show up disappeared in an instant. They didn't even have time to participate in the battle. Even though they had heard bloodthirsty's words, it was too fast!No one had expected that seven Tier 6 martial artists would be killed in an instant!This group of people ... What was going on?Was a neo martial artist really so terrifying?……At this very moment.In the outside world.Sector Lord Sen Lan's expression suddenly changed. On the other side, the AI Hong Imperator was startled and stunned.In that instant, only two venerable sovereigns had died. Suddenly, he felt the great Dao fluctuation. Everyone had died, including bloodthirsty, who was at the peak of rank six.This ... Was definitely not something the Senlan people could do.Sword Saint!In an instant, he knew who had done it."Bastard! You dare to collude with neo martial!"He was furious but also a little scared. Was there a tier seven neo martial around?He didn't even have time to act when suddenly, sector Lord Sen Lan's expression changed. Li Hao's group was even more powerful than he had expected, faster and stronger, killing 7 Type 6 experts in an instant!At this moment, in the great path universe, countless great path power surged in.Previously, he was just one step away from stepping into Grade 7!At this moment, his aura shook, and the entire forest world shook violently. A monstrous aura appeared from his body, and the forest great Dao universe and the forest world started to merge!He was going to step into Grade 7!AI Hong's expression changed!If he broke through to the 7th grade, then it would be troublesome.Possessing a great world and a level Seven one at that. As a level Seven, he had no hope of taking down the other party. He wanted to stop him, but at this moment, the entire heaven and earth, the entire chaos, seemed to be trembling violently!The Senlan great Dao universe started to expand rapidly.It swept across the world!Sector Lord Sen Lan's aura rose crazily, shaking the entire area. At this moment, an incomparably huge illusionary figure appeared in the sky. The entire forest orchid world was expanding!

Chapter 2959 The Plan Is Completed (3)
An illusionary image of a universe appeared between his eyebrows.Sector Lord Sen Lan's face revealed a look of joy and excitement.It had been too many years!In the past, when Dao master forest orchid was around, he didn't have any hope of fusing with the great Dao universe. Peak stage six seemed to be the limit of his life.And now, less than two years after Dao master forest orchid's death, he had officially stepped into the seventh stage!An incomparably powerful aura seemed to be unrivaled in the heavens and earth. That surge of energy caused the great Dao universe to expand. The world also began to expand. At this moment, sector Lord Sen LAN even seemed to be expanding ... He could fight against anyone!Invincible in the world!Of course, he knew that this was an illusion.However, he believed that once he stepped into the seventh-rank and owned the great world, it would definitely not be like before. Senlan was no longer a weak place that others could enter at will!Even if he was no match for an eighth level venerable sovereign, it would not be easy for the other party to defeat him.At this moment, he didn't even want to fulfill his promise with Li Hao and the others.Why did he want to merge with the Crimson Moon?"If I catch venerable the sword and hand them over to Hong Yue, will Hong Yue not pursue the matter? it's better to continue the Alliance or something else than to merge with Hong Yue, right?"'Although the Silver Moon King seems to have some plans ... He's just a Tier 4. If his plan fails, won't I really have to merge with the red moon?' please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Such a thought flashed madly in his mind!However, the next moment ... He thought of something.The Lord of Light, the king of neo martial artists!Yes, these people were not easy to deal with. The Crimson Moon was already setting in the West.We've suffered heavy losses time and time again, and even a junior like the Silver Moon King dares to scheme against him ... Today, I dare to capture these people and give them to the red moon. Perhaps my Sen LAN will be destroyed even faster.Red Moon doesn't know where neo martial is, but do I know?Perhaps, it was just nearby!At this moment, he was clear-headed.I can't do this!It wasn't because of the promise, nor was it because of these geniuses, but because ... These people had powerful backers behind them. He couldn't do that, or he would be killed sooner or later!As this thought emerged in his mind, he shouted coldly,""Aihong, why aren't you getting lost?"BOOM!A powerful aura instantly burst out!The AI Hong sovereign was furious!He felt a little helpless, a little angry but helpless. He had reached Grade 7. Damn it, I can't take him down!Not only that, but bloodthirsty and his men were also dead.The sector Lord sent me here as a precaution.But ...Damn it!In his anger, the void trembled. At this moment, Red Moon master also sensed everything. He sensed that the other party had entered Level Seven and that all the other venerable sovereigns had been killed! And neo martial ... Still hadn't appeared.The ones who had killed bloodthirsty and the others were probably venerable the sword and the others. He had not been able to wait for the new martial, but he had found venerable the sword, the Silver Moon King, and the Son of God of light!Perhaps ... It was enough!AI Hong was not attacked. Perhaps ... Neo martial was really not nearby.With such a thought in mind, an extremely powerful will swept through the world. Chaos retreated, and cracks seemed to appear in the void. The shadow of Red Moon Lord appeared between the world!Revered sword and the others, as well as the Senlan realmlord ... Since the new martial isn't here, then I'll take them down!At this moment, he couldn't care less about the attack on the Crimson Moon.Perhaps I'm just scaring myself.Sector Lord Sen Lan's expression changed. Damn it, Red Moon Lord had really gone crazy. If new martial was nearby, AI Hong was here, and you were here, then ... Then wouldn't Red Moon be finished?This Red Moon master was actually so gambled!Wasn't he afraid that someone would steal from his home?AI Hong was also stunned. In the next moment, she was both excited and worried. The realm Lord was here, but there was not a single advanced venerable sovereign in the realm!……"What?"The expressions of Li Hao and the others also changed!This is crazy!Venerable the sword also sensed it. He took a deep breath and cursed,“艹!”What a pity!At this moment, if neo martial was really nearby and the red moon Lord came, as long as the forest orchid sector Lord was a little braver and stalled the other party for an instant, neo martial would be able to blow up the entire Red Moon!What a pity!Such an opportunity was hard to come by!He didn't even care about his own safety. Instead, he was filled with regret, a huge regret. At this time, regardless of whether Emperor Cang and the others were here or the human King was here, he would see an opportunity and ignore them. He would rush straight to the red moon's lair. The red moon Lord would cry to death!Li Hao couldn't care about this ... Whether or not neo martial was here didn't affect their crisis.This was big trouble!He didn't expect that two high level venerable sovereigns would appear on Hong Yue's side. He could only shout,"hurry, venerable swordsman, you have to deal with the seventh level ... Let the Senlan realm Lord block for a moment ..."​ This time, it was really big trouble!Although he had made good arrangements ... The key thing was that the other party did not follow the plan. Two advanced level experts had been dispatched.In an instant, the three of them appeared near the realm gate.The three fourth-rank venerable sovereigns who were originally guarding the place had also been killed by the Senlan monarch. However, the other venerable sovereigns 'faces were all pale. Outside the boundary, two advanced venerable sovereigns, Hong Yue, and even an eighth-rank venerable sovereign, had appeared.The excitement of the sector Lord advancement had turned into fear.It's finished!Both the seventh and eighth-rank were here!Li Hao's group didn't say anything. They instantly rushed out of the boundary. They couldn't stay here for long.
