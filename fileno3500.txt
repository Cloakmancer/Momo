This demon's poisonous stingers could poison a grade seven to death. It was directly used on the great Dao!It was extremely terrifying."I didn't expect Daoist Feng Ming to come in person. I'm more confident now!" Venerable reincarnation monarch smiled.This fellow was extremely fast.Moreover, there were many poisonous stingers and the great Dao of poison and killing. Didn't li Hao have many great Dao?Let's see if he can resist the poison Dao of the bee."Oh?" venerable sovereign Feng Ming's compound eyes revealed a trace of a smile."No one from the North came?"The five elements in the North, the five overlords of the five elements realm, were all extremely powerful existences. Any one of the five elements Supreme Emperor's strength was no less than the 4000 Dao laws.However, when the five elements were combined, even huntian and Chunqiu would be wary.Would a five elements Supreme Emperor come this time?Samsara looked into the distance and whispered,"it should be soon."Feng Ming did not say much.It was normal for it to come so quickly.The people from the North might not be able to come so quickly.Just as he was thinking, the entire chaos seemed to fluctuate.The entire chaosverse seemed to have frozen.After a while, the reincarnation Emperor raised his eyebrows and smiled."I didn't expect that ... That person would come personally!"Venerable Lord bee Ming's compound eyes contracted slightly, but he soon relaxed.As for venerable Pengcheng, he was also a little surprised.""There really is one ... Earth Spirit Emperor. I thought the five elements Supreme Emperor wouldn't come alone."The five elements Supreme Emperor's strength lay in his ability to combine the five elements into one. He was not afraid of any powerhouse.However, if it was just one of them ... Thearch gold spirit was very strong. The other four were slightly weaker, even weaker than reincarnation. If one of them came alone, wouldn't he be afraid that the five elements would be destroyed if something happened?He was very bold!The void seemed to have been frozen. The powerful earth elemental power formed a Dao domain that enveloped the chaos. The rank three world beside it seemed to have been petrified.A moment later, a venerable sovereign with a yellow face appeared in front of everyone.He looked at Samsara, then at Feng Ming. He smiled."I'm here!"The reincarnation Emperor was also smiling brightly."I didn't expect fellow Daoist Earth Spirit to come here in person. This is really surprising!"The Earth Spirit also smiled, but did not say anything.The five elements Supreme Emperor had always been five in one.It was rare for him to act alone, because the death of one person could cause the overall strength to weaken. The position of the northern Overlord had always been stable, but once one person died, it might not be too stable. However, since he dared to come today, he naturally had something to rely on.Venerable sovereign Feng Ming's voice was slightly sharp and trembled.""Daoist Earth Spirit has come personally. Could it be that sovereign metal spirit has already mastered the five elemental DAOs?"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Unless their boss had already mastered another great Dao, was he really not afraid of losing one?Strictly speaking, killing the Earth Spirit was even more meaningful than killing Li Hao.It could eradicate an Overlord!"Daoist Feng Ming, you're quite knowledgeable!" Emperor Earth Spirit laughed.Everyone was stunned by his words, even venerable sovereign Feng Ming.It was said that the five elements Supreme Emperor was a twin brother. Since birth, each of them had comprehended a Dao. Each Dao was powerful and unparalleled in the world. However, the five elements Supreme Emperor had a flaw. He could not integrate the other DAOs.He was unable to cultivate the other four elements.But now, from what the Earth Spirit said, their boss could cultivate other great DAOs, and ... With great results. If this were to happen, if the gold spirit were to be left alone and combine the five elements into one, it would not be easy.However, the reincarnation Emperor laughed and said,""Then congratulations! "With the five elements combined, I think ... Fellow Daoist Jin Ling has a chance of reaching Grade 9! No wonder fellow Daoist Earth Spirit came in person. Is the primordial chaos going to give birth to a second ninth-rank combatant in the past million years?"The Earth Spirit Emperor laughed."It's still too early. Boss has only comprehended some elements of earth. Daoist Samsara, I hope you can help me with the other three elements."The reincarnation Emperor smiled and did not say anything.However, he felt a little solemn in his heart.Did he really only comprehend the earth element?If he dared to expose it ... It might not end there.Could it be that this era would return to a million years ago, with a large number of level 9s?The Earth Spirit from the North, the buzzing from the South, and Peng Cheng from the West were all here. Including the three great venerable sovereigns from Samsara, there were now six eighth rank venerable sovereigns.Furthermore, they were not Ordinary Level eight.Apart from Samsara's two weaker rank eights, the others had at least 4000 Dao waves. This kind of strength was unbelievably strong. Huntian's rank eights hadn't appeared yet, but they should be here soon.Samsara revealed a smile and didn't say anything else.Li Hao, you're very ambitious ... But you've miscalculated this time.Three days would pass by quickly.At this moment, the venerable sovereigns stopped talking.Instead, he was observing the secret realm.As for the stage three Guardian, he was also extremely nervous. In his heart, he felt a little regretful. The heavenly Daoist sect was a good place, and he had become one of the Guardians. Unfortunately ... That Silver Moon King was too flamboyant. If he had done it in secret, it would not have been a problem.It was too arrogant to do so with such great fanfare.Three days passed by in silence.Suddenly, the entrance of the secret realm emitted a faint light. At this moment, everyone instantly sobered up. The third level venerable sovereign also said nervously,""Seniors, the dojo has officially opened. According to the heavenly Daoist sect, today ... All of us will be teleported to the core dojo to participate in the founding meeting!"

Chapter 3501 The Dissipation Of Time (3)
The eyes of the Samsara Emperor flickered as he looked at the two rank eights beside him."The two of you, send your spiritual bodies inside and teleport over! We'll take your bodies and follow the fluctuations! Keep in contact at all times. If there are any changes, break the dojo and contact your physical body!"The two grade 8s didn't say much and looked at the grade 3 guard.The other party didn't dare to say anything more and hurriedly opened the door.The door emitted a faint light.In the secret realm behind the gate, a gate appeared in the sky. At this moment, there were some fluctuations coming from the gate. The Samsara sect cultivators outside also looked at the gate. Although they couldn't see it clearly, they could still see what was inside.The next moment, two rank eights and one rank three venerable sovereign entered the door at the same time and disappeared without a trace.The eyes of the Samsara Emperor flickered. At this moment, the Qi of life and death appeared in his eyes. He followed the weak fluctuations and scanned the surroundings. In the next second, his eyes lit up."Good move!"He felt it!At this moment, it was not just this place. The entire chaos seemed to be fluctuating from all directions. Countless venerable sovereigns were gathering in one direction at an incredible speed along the secret realms and branches."Chase!"Venerable reincarnation located the target, and venerable bee whine led the others to follow the trail at an extremely fast speed.In the blink of an eye, he was chasing in one direction!These eighth level venerable sovereigns were unbelievably powerful. They had even broken through the void and were almost teleported through the primal Chaos.……At this moment, a passage invisible to the naked eye appeared and teleported the spiritual bodies of countless venerable sovereigns in one direction.The huge fluctuation still attracted the attention of many powerhouses.Even some of the experts who had been in seclusion could sense the fluctuations of chaos.Outside the square region.Long Zhan looked over in one direction and let out a breath. Without saying a word, he brought everyone and chased in that direction.……The World of Ice.The group of rank eight venerable sovereigns were a little nervous. Soon, the extreme frost monarch gave the order and shouted,""Let's go to new martial arts!"They only had one goal this time ... Even if they couldn't destroy neo martial, they had to stop neo martial's rescue.The group of experts quickly disappeared.……City 9.In a place where no one could see, a huge illusion was hidden in the void.At this moment, myriad transformations Emperor and the others had arrived. They were all extremely nervous. The true bodies of the three eighth level venerable sovereigns also appeared in this secret realm.The entire secret realm was not empty. It was as beautiful as a Fairyland.Countless doors appeared in the surroundings.There were 1000 secret realm entrances.There were mountains, rivers, pavilions ... Although cultivators didn't care about the environment, this place was like an immortal realm. It even contained a large amount of pure great Dao power. At this moment, there was even a faint sound of the great Dao that reverberated in this place.The moment he entered, he felt as if he was being cleansed.The powerhouses from the middle world Alliance had all entered with their true bodies, not their spiritual forms. Although they were all rank seven, they were extremely nervous.At this moment, one of the gates trembled. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt In an instant, a ball of light appeared.The moment the ball of light appeared, it turned into a human figure. However, his appearance and aura could not be seen clearly. The new venerable sovereign was a little dazed. He looked around and saw a group of figures standing on a mountain in front of him.He was shocked!So many experts!When he arrived, he did not reveal his aura. However, the aura of the figures on the mountain peak was undoubtedly revealed. They were advanced venerable sovereigns!And not just one, but many."Welcome to the heavenly Daoist sect, my friend!"A loud voice resounded throughout the secret realm.At this moment, the doors were constantly flashing with light as venerable sovereigns arrived quickly. Some only had one, while others had several. According to the previous agreement, only one person could come. However, some doors had more than one venerable sovereign, so no one said anything.The reason why he was so bold was because the heavenly Daoist sect had made an agreement that if he wanted to come, there was no need to stop him and he would welcome all cultivators from all over.At this moment, the Thunder monarch's voice resounded in all directions,""In this place, there is no identity, no status, no level, only Dao! The heavenly Daoist Rite, the place for Dao discussions! Accept fellow Daoists from all over the world and make friends with Dao!"Balls of light appeared one after another.His voice reverberated in everyone's ears. At this moment, the venerable sovereigns were excited, excited, and somewhat uneasy.Some people looked around, not daring to reveal their identities.There were also people who were extremely bold ... They directly revealed their true appearance, as if they did not care about their identity being exposed. Here, everyone was a spiritual body.There were also people who searched around, using their mental energy to probe all directions, even wanting to probe the outside world.There were also people who were bold enough to directly spy on the experts on the mountain peak.……On the mountain peak.Myriad transformations Emperor's face was solemn. At this moment, he transmitted a message,""Fellow Daoist li ... Still not out of seclusion?"Today, according to the agreed time, the heavenly Daoist sect will open.Li Hao was supposed to be the host. It was said that there would be a Dao discussion today, but Li Hao hadn't appeared yet. Myriad transformations was worried that this guy would run away.Fortunately, Thunderlord and the others were still around, which made him feel a little more at ease.Three level 8 experts were present!This way, at least there was some comfort and they probably didn't run away. Otherwise, the few rank-8s should have run away as well.At this moment, the secret realm below was bustling with activity.At this moment, someone was a little unscrupulous and his voice spread,""The Dao master of the heavens is said to be the Silver Moon King, Supreme Emperor Hao Yue ... Why don't I see him today?"

Chapter 3502 The Dissipation Of Time (3)
"That's right!""This Taoist sanctum gathered the chaos monarchs. It's said that the purpose is to devour the Monarchs 'spiritual bodies. Is that true?"When these words were said, some people were a little afraid.Although the spiritual body wasn't the entirety of a cultivator, it would still be injured if it was devoured.Of course, there were also some people who didn't think much of it. At this moment, they looked very serious. Obviously, among these people, there were some venerable sovereigns from the enemy forces.At that moment, myriad transformations Emperor's face was cold as he said,""The heavenly Daoist Rite originated from my myriad Dao Pavilion. A few days ago, the myriad Dao Pavilion was opened in the Alliance City. Many people have entered and discussed the Dao together. But back then, it couldn't be spread everywhere. Now, the chaos monarchs can gather together and talk about Dao without status. Such a treasure land has consumed countless resources just to devour your spiritual bodies?""How can a mere spiritual body compare to the consumption of building this heavenly Daoist Rite temple?" venerable sovereign myriad transformations said angrily. "Most of you are members of our alliance. The Alliance of the middle Worlds has always been dedicated to discussing Dao, exchanging ideas, and protecting ourselves ... What does the struggle for hegemony in chaos have to do with us? What good would it do to you if whoever became the Overlord? I don't think many of you here really want our dojos to be destroyed. Some ambitious people might not want to do that. They don't want the great DAOs to exchange and monopolize the path of the great DAOs ... They want to cut off the foundation of our great DAOs!"As soon as he said that, some venerable sovereigns responded,""Senior myriad transformations is right! What does it have to do with weaklings like us who strive for hegemony and unify the chaos? Since there's this heavenly Daoist Rite, we don't want the participants of the Dao discussion to leave!""That's right!""High-level venerable sovereigns all have their own great Dao universes and clear great DAOs. We are rogue cultivators and venerable sovereigns of small and medium-sized worlds. We have no future, no direction, no communication, and have to work behind closed doors ... It's as difficult as ascending to the heavens for level one to level two. Why don't you give us a way out?"“……”In the secret land, a large number of venerable sovereigns began to boil.They were all very dissatisfied with the troublemakers.However, the Thunder monarch did not care about this. His voice was loud and covered the entire area."The dojo is just built. Everyone has reservations and fears. No one is willing to be the first to discuss the Dao emperors!""The Daoist master has said that we, high-level venerable sovereigns, will each preach for three days. We'll throw bricks and lead the way!""In addition, the true form of the Dao chess is hidden in the secret realm of the heavenly Daoist field. There are 9999 great DAOs. Anyone can enter the Dao chess to gain enlightenment ... The premise is that they pass the test and transmit the voice of the great Dao to the secret realm. The Dao chess can accept it!"As soon as he said that, many people were shocked.The Thunder monarch continued."The DAOs in the daoqi are the DAOs of the former Overlord, the master of tianfang, and the master of space. They control 9999 DAOs. Although it's only a simple description, it's a Dao that connects to the heavens!"Below, even the troublemakers were quiet and listening carefully. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Dao chess, Daoist Tian Fang. This ... They had actually made the chess game public!In fact, many people knew that the way of chess contained the way of the heavens. Li Hao actually dared to publicize the way of a hegemon. This ... Was crazy!However, it also made everyone's eyes turn red!If he taught the way and the sound of the great Dao could be imprinted on the Dao chess, could he enter the Dao chess to comprehend the Dao? Moreover, these advanced venerable sovereigns would each preach for three days.This was simply great news!At this moment, many venerable sovereigns were a little impulsive, excited, and unwilling to accept the destruction of this Taoist sanctum. This might be the place where they were most likely to obtain the truth of the great path in their lives.As soon as he said this, not only them, but even the venerable sovereigns of myriad transformations were excited.This ... They didn't know before.They were worried that the establishment of the dojo would cause everyone to be wary and not dare to discuss the Dao. However, if there was a high-level venerable sovereign teaching the Dao and the Dao chess as a lure, the path of a top level nine venerable sovereign's Dao was right in front of them ... There was only one path. As long as no one destroyed the heavenly Daoist temple, it would be a Holy Land for cultivation!If this news spread, all the venerable sovereigns in the primal Chaos would probably go crazy.At this time, another venerable sovereign's voice came out,""It's a good thing to publicize the Dao chess, but ... We're more curious about whether venerable Emperor Hao Yue's Dao of time will be made public. "Countless people looked at the ball of light!Is he crazy?Which side was this guy from?The announcement of Dao chess was already out of everyone's expectations, and there were still people who had ideas about Shi Guang.At this moment, the Thunder Emperor's eyes were cold as he looked at the ball of light and said coldly,""Even if it's made public, do you have the right to learn it?"The ball of light was fearless!Even if he was killed, it would only be his spiritual body that was injured. What was there to be afraid of?His voice was still cold."Supreme Emperor Hao Yue, you want to collect all the DAOs in the world to perfect your Dao of self. If that's the case ... Why don't you make time public? let's cultivate it together!" It has only been a few years since venerable Emperor Hao Yue rose to power, but he has already entered the seventh rank. Clearly, this is the true path to heaven. Since you are so kind, why don't you make it public and let us try to enter the seventh rank ..."Although some people felt that it was inappropriate, they didn't say anything. In fact ... They were really looking forward to it.Flowing time!It was the most mysterious great Dao in the legends.It was unbelievable.Immortality, reversing time.In everyone's eyes, Li Hao's rise to Level 7 was all thanks to time. It was unbelievable that someone else cultivated for 10000 years in one day, while the other person spent 10000 years in one day.These troublemakers were only trying to stall for time.

Chapter 3503 The Dissipation Of Time (3)
He was waiting for some experts to come back.As for the Thunder monarch, he looked at the ball of light with lightning flashing in his eyes. He was a little cold. "You're also a grade 8. If you're sincere in discussing Dao, we'll welcome you. If you're here to cause trouble ... Don't blame me for being merciless!"These words once again shook the hearts of the people.This person was also at the eighth rank?Which side are you from?The ball of light was unafraid and laughed,""What? are experts not allowed to discuss the Dao? Then is this heavenly Daoist sect a place to discuss Dao or to satisfy your selfish desires? I've heard that the Dao of time can only succeed by devouring tens of thousands of DAOs ... So, did you all build this heavenly Daoist Rite for the Dao discussion or to devour the chaotic ten thousand emperors? If Li Hao wants to conquer the world and unify the chaos, why don't you just make it public? why hide it?"The Thunder monarch's expression became even colder!Beside him, Emperor Wushan was calmer. He looked at the ball of light and said,"If you think it's inappropriate, you can leave or build your own heavenly Daoist temple and publicize your Dao. It's easy for you to teach some great Dao with your level eight body ... Why don't I see you preaching to chaos?""Hehe." Wu Shan chuckled and said with some contempt,"you all only know how to take advantage of others. I haven't seen any achievements you've made in the past million years of chaos!" The chaotic struggle for hegemony devoured the weak and did not cultivate one's own Dao. The great Dao was to be cultivated, not devoured! Today, when the heavenly Daoist Rite was built, you have been causing trouble again and again. Everyone in the chaos knows what you are planning!"Both sides seemed to be stalling for time.However, they didn't really cross swords.Wu Shan and the others were waiting for Li Hao, while the cultivator who had sneaked in was waiting for the experts to arrive so that he could kill Li Hao's group.……Outside the illusionary realm.At this moment, countless cultivators were floating above the Silver Moon. The venerable sovereigns and Dao integration cultivators were all floating in the sky and in the great path universe. They were both excited and uneasy.At this moment, Li Hao's River of Dao appeared. The experts felt the realms in the river of Dao and were all excited.That was because ... They felt a sense of intimacy.It was very familiar! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt It was as if ... That was his own Dao, completely the same.At this moment, Li Hao felt that the boundaries in the river had changed. He looked at the others and exhaled."Success or failure depends on this one move! Whether or not you can completely merge with my Dao will depend on today!"He looked at the two Dao Masters.At this moment, Qian Wuliang's eyes were filled with nervousness. Complete integration ... This was not cooperation like before. He was completely integrating his great Dao into Li Hao's realm and controlling the Dao in Li Hao's realm.Can I?He did not know.Hong Yitang was also a little nervous.He didn't know if this fusion method was reliable, but at this point ... This might be his only hope.He took a deep breath and walked out.""I'll go first!"With that, he headed straight for one of the realms. He transformed into a River of the great Dao. At this moment, he entered a realm. Looking at the somewhat scattered Dao laws in the realm in front of him, he took a deep breath. In the next moment, his body merged with the Dao laws. In an instant, he seemed to have blended into the boundless chaos.The sense of familiarity was not unfamiliar at all.Hong Yitang was slightly shaken as he completely fused with it ... This little realm originally only had the power of a stage one World, but at this moment, as Hong Yitang fused with it, the little realm instantly expanded and the great Dao shook!After merging with the power of Hong Yitang's great Dao, the little realm instantly began to expand, and the power of the great Dao became dense.2nd rank, 3rd rank ... In an instant, this realm actually instantly became a peak rank six world!Everyone was shocked when they saw this!Completely integrated!On the other side, Qian Wuliang's face lit up with joy. Suddenly, many incarnations merged with the small realms. The small realms that were only level One World power before suddenly expanded at this moment.The power of his great Dao instantly increased by a large margin!The other venerable sovereigns didn't wait any longer. They followed their familiar auras and flew toward the small realms. At this moment, the venerable sovereigns all entered the ethereal extent.The power of the little realm continued to rise.Li Hao, who had fused a thousand realms, had only fused a level-one ethereal extent before. The power of a single small realm was actually very weak and only had the power of an ordinary venerable sovereign. However, at this moment, a large number of medium-level worlds had appeared!The entire Silvermoon universe seemed to have been emptied in an instant.Countless forces and Dao laws seethed in Li Hao's realm.At this moment, Kong Ji also laughed. He entered a world, the world of destruction and recovery. This world was also the core of Li Hao's 2000th world. It had already reached Level 4, and it surged wildly at this moment.In the blink of an eye, apart from the lack of a Dao universe, it had actually turned into a seventh-tier great world!At this moment, Li Hao felt an extremely powerful force!The long river of Dao shook madly!The power of countless great DAOs merged into the river without any obstacles.This was stacking!They were completely stacked, not just a little. Li Hao even felt that he was going to lose control. His strength had increased too much in an instant. Countless great DAOs surged into his ethereal extent, making it expand from the weakest venerable sovereign power to a much larger size in the blink of an eye.And it was only a thousand or so worlds.There wasn't much of a difference from before, but ... The quality was completely different.The little realms before were all true little realms, the weakest little realms.However, at this moment, a large number of small worlds turned into medium-level worlds, and even gave birth to a few high-level worlds. There was Nirvana, revival, Sen Luo hell, calamity realm ...

Chapter 3504 The Dissipation Of Time (6)
These worlds had all become high-level worlds.Li Hao sensed it in silence. Looking at the realm before him, he took a deep breath as the experts merged with it and guarded it. At this moment, he could feel a surging power!He had never felt so powerful before!After taking a closer look, he realized that he was still in the thousand worlds. However, his power had increased from nearly 2000 Dao laws to at least 4000 Dao laws. It had almost doubled.Such strength was probably not weaker than venerable sovereign Pengcheng.It was just that ... After merging with the Silver Moon, it seemed that this was the best it could do. It had pushed Li Hao, who was at the peak of the seventh step, to the eighth step, and he was not considered weak among the eighth step.However, there was still a gap between him and the reincarnation Emperor.At this moment, in the realm, an empty voice resounded,""How is it?""I think I can fight Pengcheng," Li Hao said with a smile."That kun Peng may not be my match!"For a moment, the emptiness was a little surprised, but in the next moment, it turned into frustration.F * ck, only at this stage?This won't do!He, Sen LAN, and many other venerable sovereigns had fused with the boundary, but they had only pushed Li Hao to this level. It was not enough.I thought you would be able to fight Samsara!"This isn't enough!"Kong Ji was helpless. The other Silver Moon martial masters in the other worlds were also depressed.I thought that after merging with my Silvermoon, I would at least be able to reach the peak of the eighth step, that level of fighting long Zhan.Li Hao chuckled. Merging with a world powerhouse at the peak of Type 6 and pushing himself to a level that was considered powerful among type 8, these guys actually felt that it wasn't enough. Were they overestimating him, or were they overestimating themselves?As for second cat, it could only replicate rank seven DAOs. It couldn't replicate even stronger rank eight great DAOs.This might be the limit of second cat.Unless second cat was stronger.Otherwise, integrating a seventh-level Dao and forging a seventh-level Ethereal Plane was already the limit. Li Hao was only a seventh-level venerable sovereign and had not reached the eighth level, so it was difficult for him to integrate an eighth-level Dao. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  At this moment, Yuan Shuo, who had yet to integrate himself into the group, grinned.""I'm still missing one. I'll merge with it ... You still have to improve a bit ... My five-element Dao isn't weak ..."He had been looking for the five elements realm, but Li Hao's five elements were independent. He wondered if he should create his own five elements realm and try to merge them.Li Hao chuckled."Teacher, you've only just entered the seventh step. Even if you merge with it, the increase won't be too great. From 4000 to 4100?"It might be like this.Yuan Shuo was a little speechless when he heard that. That was all?"You ..." His expression turned serious."You've been preparing for so long, but in the end ... Forget about Samsara, you can only deal with Pengcheng. Even with the Thunder Lord and the other two, I'm afraid it's not enough!"Didn't this mean that they had prepared for nothing?At the very least, he had to reach the level of reincarnation in order to have a chance of blocking this attack.Why don't you just delay for some time before opening the heavenly Daoist sect?At this moment, Li Hao was looking at the sky. The chaos great Dao appeared in his eyes. He had merged with chaos, and all the great DAOs were actually connected to chaos.Li Hao looked up and saw a star.Time star!There were tens of thousands of DAOs in the time star.As for these 10000 DAOs, they weren't too strong. When all 10000 DAOs were combined, they were only at the sixth step. This meant that these 10000 DAOs weren't too powerful. They were all very weak.The most powerful Dao was only at the sixth level, or even lower.This was the time star left behind by Zhan Tiandi ... Or rather, it was just a seed of time.At this moment, Li Hao looked at the exhausted second cat, who was already lying on the river, too lazy to move. It had been exhausted these days, so tired that it didn't want to move." 4000 Dao laws are naturally not enough ..."Li Hao said slowly. A moment later, he said softly,""If the 4000 Dao laws are all in chaos, they wouldn't be much different from cultivators with other 4000 Dao laws ... But what if they aren't in chaos?"Time ... Was orderly!It definitely was!Li Hao laughed and looked at second cat.""Second cat, I'll have to trouble you with one last thing ..."Second cat wanted to cry!What was it?"I'll make a copy of this time and star. I'll just make a copy of it in general. I'm going to break through the time and star and gather the power of the 10000 DAOs into my River so that I can undergo an orderly transformation!"Second cat's teeth were hurting and his head was about to explode."I can't replicate it ...""I know, but ... It's broken. First, you can duplicate the 10000 DAOs. That'll be easy. The 10000 DAOs are very weak. Later, I'll reassemble them!"Second cat was stunned. It looked at Li Hao in shock.Are you serious? If you fail, time will be gone."Also, now that it's broken, will the river of time disappear? if it does ... Won't your heavenly Daoist Rite be finished?"You ... Can you reassemble it?"Second cat was a little uncertain, but Li Hao laughed."If I didn't have any Foundation, I naturally wouldn't be able to do it. But now, you've duplicated the 10000 DAOs, and I'm only arranging and combining them. Naturally, I can reassemble them!"Was it?Second cat was a little hesitant, but he still nodded."Shi Guang is only at Tier 6 ... I should be able to duplicate it if I take it apart ..."It wasn't a Dao that was too powerful.However, its internal structure was extremely complicated, and it was unable to completely replicate it.Li Hao, on the other hand, did not hesitate at all. He instantly picked up the time star. The small star trembled slightly. At this moment, Li Hao took a deep breath. While everyone was stunned and dazzled, the time star suddenly trembled violently, and a great Dao ... Was stripped from the star with a boom.The entire star began to collapse, as if its core had been taken away. Weak great DAOs overflowed wildly. Second cat hurriedly began to copy them. He looked at Li Hao nervously.He had gone too far!This guy really tore it down.This lunatic!Li Hao's eyes were filled with joy. He had always wanted to tear it down, but he didn't dare to. He was worried that he would lose time.But today ... I'm going to tear it down!Time was about to disappear.At this moment, he even forgot about the enemy that was about to arrive. In his eyes, countless cries appeared madly. He continued to observe and investigate. The river of time that covered the Eastern Region also began to show signs of collapsing at this moment.Time and Stars were gone, and the river that connected a thousand worlds would naturally collapse.At this moment, the Monarchs who had arrived at the heavenly Daoist Rite had no idea or felt it yet. If they did, they would know that once the river collapsed, their spiritual bodies would never be able to return.……At the same time.In the chaos.One figure after another was chasing after the fluctuations. Suddenly, the expression in someone's eyes changed slightly. He frowned slightly and looked in all directions. The fluctuations of the long river from before were now even more intense.There were some ... Signs of it collapsing.What was going on?The reincarnation Emperor, who was about to catch up, frowned and looked into the distance. The end point was probably there, but ... Something seemed to have happened. His eyes changed."Li Hao's flowing time seems to have a problem!"The other venerable sovereigns didn't notice anything, but they were a little confused. What was the problem?……Outside the square region.Long Zhan also instantly furrowed his brows and said in a low voice,""Strange! Li Hao ... Was attacked?"Could it be so fast?His time ripple was actually starting to disappear. What did this mean?Time ... Had collapsed? ……Deep in the chaos.Where the statues were.Suddenly, the tianfang master opened his eyes, and a look of shock appeared in his eyes. With some disbelief and some indescribable feelings, his voice suddenly reverberated,""Bastard!"At the side, another statue opened its eyes. There was a serious look in its eyes."Tian Fang, time ... Has disappeared?"The master of Tian Fang didn't say anything.Time seemed to have disappeared.He felt like going crazy.Time had disappeared!Why was it like this?The battle hadn't started yet, so why was this happening?Bastard, that bastard, did he break time himself?Would anyone break time by themselves?Impossible, impossible. No one can resist the temptation of time. Who would break time by themselves?He couldn't believe it!At this moment, even an omnipotent expert like him found it hard to believe. Or could it be that ... That person had been attacked without his knowledge?This was unbelievable!

Chapter 3505 Sword Out, Time Sword!
The heavenly Daoist sect.All of a sudden, the doors that were shining with light dimmed.In the beginning, no one paid much attention to it.But very quickly, those doors began to close, instantly attracting the attention of many people. Immediately, some people's expressions changed. The few powerhouses who were causing trouble also instantly changed their expressions and looked at the passages behind.What was going on?This time, someone couldn't help but shout and interrupt Thunderlord and the others,"what are you all doing? Why does the passageway seem to be unable to teleport?"In an instant, there was an uproar.The passageway can't be transported anymore?Then ... Wouldn't he be in big trouble!Although not all of them had spiritual bodies, it would be a loss for venerable sovereigns if they died here. Some people had come to watch the show, while others had come to discuss the Dao sincerely.The sudden loss of contact was shocking.Even Li Hao's supporters felt their hearts palpitate.Li Hao, are you really going to devour everyone's spiritual bodies?Otherwise, why would they cut off the passage?People kept trying, and some even tried to get close to the gate, but ... The gate that was originally there was now completely closed.This time, an uproar instantly emerged."What are they doing?""Do you really want to discuss Dao?""I even thought that this was our chance, and that the heavenly Daoist Rite was a good place for chaos ..."“……”The venerable sovereigns were furious!How hateful!The Thunderlord and the others 'expressions changed. They had not expected the channel's connection to be suddenly cut off.He didn't have such plans before.Li Hao would never create the heavenly Daoist sect just to devour everyone's spiritual bodies. That would be too much of a loss.At this moment, the Thunder monarch was also a little helpless, but he still quickly shouted,""Everyone, please be quiet for a moment. We have no intention of devouring your spiritual bodies. It might be a powerful enemy who has attacked and cut off the teleportation channel. Please be patient!"At this moment, he could only leave this to the enemy. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  However, he was still puzzled. Did a strong enemy break the passage?Who could instantly disconnect?That's impossible, right? Or was Li Hao doing something?At this moment, he was a little nervous. It was not because of the danger, but ... If this continued, the reputation of the heavenly Daoist sect might be ruined. Once it was ruined, it would be difficult to salvage it.How troublesome!If everyone was afraid and didn't dare to come, all their efforts would be in vain. However, the venerable sovereigns below were not quiet because of this. Under the leadership of several powerhouses, they became more and more restless."Didn't the heavenly Daoist sect say that it would be safe? How could it be disconnected? where was Li Hao? Why hasn't he appeared yet? could it be that ... He's taking advantage of our spiritual bodies entering to deal with our true bodies? To devour worlds?"As soon as he said this, even some of the people who were calm before were instantly agitated.No way?"Self-destruct your spiritual body and cut off the connection," another venerable sovereign shouted."Let me know that something has happened here. Otherwise, I'm not prepared. It's easy for something to go wrong ..."As soon as he said this, some venerable sovereigns really wanted to self-destruct.It was fine if he lost a bit of his spiritual body. He should at least let his main body know. Otherwise, his main body might not even know that he had lost contact.Thunderlord was really a little anxious now.At this moment, the sound of the great Dao reverberated. Monarch Wushan's five fingers shook the heavens and earth as he shouted,""Calm down! If those few fellows dare to bewitch you again, I'll kill you all!""You really want to kill ..."Sovereign Wushan frowned as well. He was ready to kill the spiritual bodies of these guys when he heard this. It was these bastards who had been instigating the commotion.As for why the connection was cut, he had no idea.However, he knew that it was definitely not for the sake of these weak venerable sovereigns.Just as he was about to take down a few troublesome fellows.Suddenly, the world shook.The secret realm shook.A moment later, a person appeared in the sky. Li Hao came over with a calm expression. At this moment, he looked at the thousands of spiritual entities and said in a calm voice,""I'm Li Hao!"The commotion quieted down for a moment.Li Hao had come out!Since he had come out ... The so-called surprise attack on their world should not be true, right?Some people felt more at ease.In the crowd, someone shouted again,""Li Hao, when you established the heavenly Daoist sect, you said that you were free to come and go. Today is only the first day, and you can't be teleported back. You're up to no good ..."Li Hao looked at the ball of light and smiled."I know you!""You know him?" the ball of light immediately shouted. You said that my identity is kept a secret on the battlefield of the heavens, but you're actually able to pry into my identity. Does that mean that the so-called secret of my identity is a joke?"Li Hao chuckled.It had to be said that these people really had some skills. No matter what you said, they could find your weakness and attack you.He nodded."Others may not know, but I and the myriad transformations Emperor definitely know your identities. If even I and the myriad transformations Emperor don't know ... That would be a joke. What else is there to say?"He chuckled,"if we, as the leaders, are not clear about it, do you think that this heavenly Daoist sect is under my control?" My friend from the reincarnation realm, what do you think?"The man's expression changed.This guy ...If Li Hao had quibbled, it would have been fine, but he had already said it. He knew it, and so did myriad transformations. As venerable sovereigns ... Who would really think that these supervisors didn't know their identities?That would be a joke.Li Hao, with a bright smile on his face, instantly attacked. His huge palm covered the sky and directly attacked two people in the crowd. His voice spread out,""The two rank eight venerable sovereigns of the reincarnation realm have come. Although they are only spiritual bodies, don't you think it's a pity that they died here?"

Chapter 3506 Sword Out, Time Sword!
The two of them appeared in an instant. One of them changed his expression and shouted,""Li Hao, didn't your heavenly Daoist sect say that you can enter and leave as you wish, Friend or Foe? Since that's the case ... Are you going to attack us?"Li Hao nodded."Be it enemies or friends, it's fine if they're here. If they don't cause trouble, then so be it!" But the two of you have been creating chaos here and ruining my Dao field. If you don't even let off the destroyers, then it would be a joke!"As soon as he finished speaking, the giant hand descended, and the two grade 8 powerhouses instantly attacked.A powerful mind power spread out, and some of the surrounding spiritual body venerable sovereigns were knocked back. Even if they were only spiritual bodies, an eighth-rank spiritual body was still an eighth-rank spiritual body. It was extremely powerful, and its true combat strength might even surpass some of the sixth-rank venerable sovereigns.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ One could imagine how great the difference between the eighth and sixth step was. The two of them did not sit still and wait for death. Since Li Hao had discovered them and was about to eliminate them, they would break the dojo and reveal the specific coordinates so that the experts like the Samsara Emperor could arrive here as soon as possible.However, how could Li Hao give them the chance?In an instant, the two spiritual bodies froze. Under everyone's horrified eyes, the two spiritual bodies shattered in an instant. Countless spiritual energy scattered in all directions and was instantly absorbed by the surrounding venerable sovereigns.The spiritual body of a level eight venerable sovereign was quite nourishing, but it was not worth mentioning to Li Hao.However, to some of the nearby venerable sovereigns, it was a great supplement!A few venerable sovereigns 'spiritual bodies had obviously strengthened by a large margin. All of a sudden, the noise around them died down.Originally, these two weren't the only ones causing trouble. However, at this moment, there was endless silence. The other troublemakers didn't say a word. They were all very quiet.However, there were also venerable sovereigns, such as the third level venerable sovereign who had led them in. His expression changed drastically and he instantly roared,""Li Hao, today is the day you die! You dare to shatter the spiritual bodies of two sovereigns!""The emperors of Samsara are about to arrive. The heavenly Daoist Rite is just a joke. Don't be fooled by Li Hao ..." He roared.Li Hao only listened in silence. When the other party was almost done, he waved his hand, and the other party's spiritual body exploded with a bang.It spread out once again and was absorbed by the surrounding venerable sovereigns. However, this time, it was only the spiritual body of a rank three venerable sovereign. It was very weak and did not have much effect.All of a sudden, the venerable sovereigns around them changed their expressions.This Li Hao......Killed him directly.Behind Li Hao, several venerable sovereigns of the middle world Alliance, including the myriad transformations Emperor, hesitated for a moment, but they still said,""Daoist Hao Yue ... It's fine to kill these troublemakers, but ... But did the Samsara monarchs break the connection?"At this moment, he was also a little uneasy.Why did the tunnel seem to have disappeared? Li Hao chuckled and said,"no!" The reincarnation sect doesn't have the ability to cut off my heavenly Daoist Rite temple. Otherwise, why would they stop me? they could have just cut it off. I was the one who cut off the connection. "Everyone's expression changed when they heard this."Don't worry," Li Hao said."I know that you're all uneasy right now. I cut off the connection because I don't want to implicate you. This time, a large number of experts are attacking ... It's fine if your spiritual bodies are destroyed, but if I'm involved, it'll be Li Hao's fault!"Li Hao chuckled."This time, there are many strong enemies, but I'm not unprepared. Some people want to stop me from building the heavenly Daoist Rite, and I won't let them have their way. You are all venerable sovereigns, and I think many of you would like to have an opportunity to exchange ideas about the great Dao. You would also like to see the power of advanced venerable sovereigns and their comprehension of the great Dao ... This time, you're only here in your spiritual form. Even if it's destroyed, it doesn't matter!""As for me ... I'll now stand guard for all of you. For the first batch of cultivators who came to the dojo, I'll give you a chance. I wonder if you're interested?"As soon as he said that, someone in the crowd said in a deep voice,""What do you say, Dao master Hao Yue? Did you cut off the connection just to give us an opportunity?""Yes,""A great opportunity!" Li Hao nodded.He laughed,"don't you all want to feel and see time?" Didn't you want to witness the battle between advanced venerable sovereigns? This time, the opportunity has come!"In an instant, he waved his hand. Suddenly, a long river of the great path appeared, and countless stars appeared.These stars were all very weak.It was extremely weak, but there were more than 10000 of them.Li Hao smiled brilliantly."This is the Dao of time. The dismantled Dao of time can transform into tens of thousands of stars. Fellow Daoists, if you're interested, you can enter and carefully comprehend one! I'll be fighting a strong enemy later, and all of you ... Can even sit in and personally participate in the battle between high-rank venerable sovereigns. If I win, not only will you be able to comprehend time, you'll also be able to witness or even personally participate in a battle between eighth-rank venerable sovereigns!""If I lose, you will all lose a spiritual body! Of course, there's only reward if there's effort ... It depends on what you think about the price-to-performance ratio. The investment is a spiritual body, and the reward ... May be beyond imagination!"As soon as he said that, there was an uproar!What?To personally experience the flow of time and participate in the battle against a rank-8, this ...As soon as these words came out, the commotion continued.In an instant, several figures appeared in the crowd. There were men and women, and although their identities were unknown, they were obviously experts. Someone said in a deep voice,""Senior Hao Yue's meaning is that ... If our spiritual bodies stay in there ... We can participate in the battle between the higher level beings? Does senior mean that ... You need our help in this battle?"

Li Hao smiled and nodded."That's true. I won't deny it. Of course, I'll let go of the main body. It's indeed very dangerous. But the spiritual body ... It's up to you now to see if you're interested. I've always believed that there's strength in numbers. There are thousands of venerable sovereigns here, so you can choose any star that suits you. These stars are all very weak ... But I'll let you all witness that no matter how weak the Dao is, when it's combined, it will be extremely powerful!"That's right, he was here to grab some men.The time DAOs had been dismantled and were now scattered across the river. It was not bad that there was no one to keep watch. However, those who did were all venerable sovereigns. Even if they were only spiritual bodies, one or two would be useless. But there were thousands of them here!Even if these venerable sovereigns weren't as powerful as real venerable sovereigns, there were still hundreds of them.Li Hao's Dao of fusion would reach its peak in an instant!Of course, what he said was true. If they won, these people would gain a lot. They could comprehend the thousands of DAOs in time and participate in the battle of advanced venerable sovereigns. Such an opportunity might not come by once in a lifetime.If he lost, he would only have to pay the price of his spiritual body."Samsara and the others should be here soon!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao chuckled."I hope everyone can make a choice as soon as possible ...""What if you don't want to?" someone asked in a deep voice.Li Hao smiled."I'm not willing ... You probably can't return to your main bodies now. So, we can only find a safe place and hide you there. After a while, you'll naturally wake up ... If I win, I'll send you back. If I lose ... You can try and see if you can return naturally.""Senior Hao Yue, are you forcing us to participate?"Some people were instantly dissatisfied!"Like I said, you can choose not to participate," Li Hao said with a smile."Then I want to go back!"Li Hao looked at the shadow and said with a smile,""I said, now, no, we have to wait! You ... Do you still have any objections? I'm not a good person. Even the heavenly Daoist sect was not built entirely for you, but to perfect my Dao! I'm only asking for your opinion, whether you agree or not ... At this moment, I probably can't return. Are you satisfied with this answer?"He wasn't a kind person, and besides, he really couldn't send them back at this moment.Li Hao's expression became calm again."There will always be people who are willing to try. Those who are unwilling, you can stay. I will find some time to send you back!" He said. Those who were willing could now enter the corresponding realm according to their own Dao ... If the realms and great DAOs overlapped, two people, three people ... More people could enter the realm! You don't need to do anything, you don't need to do anything, just merge your spiritual bodies into the world!"Many people were actually very dissatisfied.Li Hao didn't care.Once he felt the benefits ... He would be satisfied.If he lost, he would be dead. Why would he care if they were satisfied?However, if they won, the spiritual bodies and venerable sovereigns in the harmonious realm would have great gains. This was not fake. Wealth came from danger. For venerable sovereigns, if there were practical benefits, when the heavenly Daoist sect opened, even if they suffered a loss, these guys would still rush over.She didn't need to be taken care of like a child.Sure enough, with so many venerable sovereigns, there had to be someone who wanted to give it a try. As soon as Li Hao finished speaking, at least hundreds of venerable sovereigns rose into the air and headed straight for the countless stars. Take a gamble!It was just a spiritual body. Although it was also very important, it was clear that there was no way to return now. Then ... It was fine if it was broken, but what if he really won?Wouldn't that be a huge profit?With these several hundred people entering first, all of a sudden, the others couldn't hold back. Who cares!At this point ... Everyone had no other choice.Although some of them cursed Li Hao in their hearts, they were too curious to follow him.There were venerable sovereigns constantly merging into those weak little realms.These small realms were all extremely weak Dao stars. However, with the infusion of the venerable sovereigns 'spiritual power, the stars began to shine and grow.Li Hao didn't feel much about one or two of them.When there were hundreds, thousands ...Li Hao was also secretly shocked!Sure enough, the more people there were, the more power there was. When the venerable sovereigns 'spiritual power merged, it was not just their spiritual power, but also some of their comprehension of the great Dao that began to merge with the Dao stars.A few hundred of them would probably be comparable to a rank seven venerable sovereign!This was actually beyond his expectations. It was even more terrifying than he had expected.Of course, this was also related to the fact that these people were spiritual bodies. Spiritual bodies did not have many attributes. If they were compatible with the great Dao, it was easy to integrate. If they couldn't integrate, then let er Mao walk around and he could integrate.Under normal circumstances, where could he get thousands of spiritual bodies of venerable sovereigns?At this moment, Li Hao was all smiles.​ Beside him, myriad transformations Emperor's expression changed again and again. He transmitted a message to Li Hao."Fellow Daoist Hao Yue ... This ..."He felt that something was wrong.Was this appropriate?He didn't know what Li Hao was doing, but he was worried ... Even if they won this time, would they still dare to come?Then wouldn't the heavenly Daoist sect be destroyed?Li Hao laughed and sent a voice transmission, fellow Daoist myriad transformations, you're overthinking it! The human heart was greedy! When they feel the beauty of the Dao and personally participate in the battle against a high-rank venerable sovereign, they may all have some breakthroughs when they return ... Even if one in a thousand breaks through from rank three to rank four, or from rank six to rank seven ... Do you know that this kind of publicity is much better than anything we do!"

Chapter 3508 Sword Out, Time Sword!
How difficult was it to break through?But this time, Li Hao felt that there was still hope. It was actually very normal for someone's spiritual body to gain some enlightenment and make a breakthrough after returning. When the time came, they would come to him on their own without having to call him.Benefits were the Supreme Truth.No one would do things that did not benefit them, but everyone would fight to do things that would benefit them.At this moment, Li Hao no longer thought about it. He was feeling his strength increase again. His heart was filled with joy. The power of the great DAOs spread throughout the entire River of great DAOs.They were originally taken out from the time star, but at this time, they also exuded a faint special power. Gradually, they seemed to have gathered into a weak time power.Time ... Still existed.However, it wasn't obvious at the moment because it had been dismantled. Li Hao also discovered that the great DAOs that made up the time stars were special. They were not pure great DAOs, but purified great DAOs.In comparison, it was much purer.This might be the key to Zhan Tiandi's ability to construct the time star. The DAOs he constructed time stars were all relatively more orderly.At this moment, Li Hao's smile grew brighter.Behind him, there were a few rank eights and a few rank Sevens. At this moment, they were extremely solemn. They were not sure about the specific situation. As for those weak stars ... They could only say that they were dispensable.They felt that so what if these extremely weak great path stars were fused with their spiritual bodies?Could it increase his strength?How much would it increase?At Li Hao's level, could it increase his strength by 100 or 200 rays?At this moment, the Thunder monarch also said quickly,"those two guys just now are both Samsara's venerable sovereigns. They're level eight venerable sovereigns. Now ... I'm afraid our location has been completely exposed. They might arrive soon!"After he finished speaking, he took another look at the hundreds of spiritual bodies left in the secret realm and transmitted a message,""What should we do with these guys?"There were still some people who were unwilling to enter Li Hao's Dao star.Thousands of venerable sovereigns had entered, but hundreds of them remained."Let's destroy this place first so that they won't self-destruct and spread the news to me ..."With a wave of Li Hao's hand, the power of destruction overflowed. The spiritual bodies of hundreds of venerable sovereigns were all destroyed in an instant, and the entire mysterious realm returned to silence.At this moment, Li Hao looked in a certain direction and exhaled.""They ... Are here!"So many!'It's not just Samsara's three rank eights. There's a higher possibility than expected. Samsara really thinks highly of me, or ... Do they think more highly of long Zhan?'Was this prepared for long Zhan or for neo martial?In short, it shouldn't be me.Otherwise, there would be no need for so many grade 8!……In the distance.A group of people crossed the void. Behind the Samsara Emperor, the two rank eight venerable sovereigns had unsightly expressions on their faces. They had just been immersed in the battle when they suddenly realized that their spiritual power had been shattered. They had obviously been killed.Of course, it was precisely because of this that they were able to instantly find their bearings when Li Hao cut off the fluctuations. p The reincarnation Emperor stopped.At this moment, he was smiling.They're here!Li Hao's group was here.The next moment, the space in the distance trembled. Li Hao and his group walked out of the secret realm. Li Hao, three level 8s, and several Level 7s venerable sovereigns.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The several rank seven venerable sovereigns of the middle world Alliance were all very serious.When he saw the situation clearly ...Other than myriad transformations Emperor, the others 'expressions changed. What kind of joke was this?Someone who was well-informed had a huge change in expression. His heart trembled as he sent a message to the others,""Not good!""It's ... It's the buzzing from the South, the Earth Spirit from the North, and ... Pengcheng ..."In an instant, even the myriad transformations Emperor's face turned pale.They were all top-notch experts, truly well-known figures of the chaos.Be it Feng Ming or the Earth Spirit, they were all top tier level eight. These people had actually all come.There was also Samsara, who was originally the strongest in the East.He had originally thought that only Samsara and the others would come. Who would have thought that experts from both the north and south would come?This was not all!Just as the six rank eights appeared, a faint rank eight aura appeared behind them. It was the venerable sovereigns from the Western huntian faction. Not only them, but there were also venerable sovereigns further away!He was also at the eighth step!They were ... Some eighth level venerable sovereigns who had followed them secretly from all directions. Some of them had come to watch the show, and some had come to see if there was any advantage to take. They were all far away, but they could see the situation clearly.There were even some seventh rank venerable sovereigns hiding in the dark.This time, the chaos was aware that there would be a battle between the two sides unless Li Hao escaped. But since Li Hao did not leave, there would definitely be a conflict.When they saw the situation in the dark, they were also secretly speechless.He's dead!Samsara, Peng Cheng, Feng Ming, and earth Spirit were all here. In addition to the other four rank eight venerable sovereigns, there were a total of eight rank eight venerable sovereigns. They were even more powerful than the attack on the human King realm last time.In addition to rank eight venerable sovereigns, they were accompanied by nearly 20 rank seven venerable sovereigns. Some of them came from the world of reincarnation, while others came from various places.The difference in power ... Was too great.At this moment, the Samsara Emperor was looking at Li Hao from afar. He and Li Hao had never had a direct confrontation. They had fought twice, one against long Zhan and the other against the human King.And Li Hao had gained something from both trips.Li Hao had even killed Fu Sheng!The reincarnation Emperor looked at Li Hao. He was not in a hurry. Instead, he smiled."Silver Moon King, I thought ... You would run away!"

Chapter 3509 Sword Out, Time Sword!
Li Hao looked at him.He didn't have much enmity toward this person.It could only be said that the situation had forced everyone to do this. He didn't have any deep grudges with Samsara, so he didn't care about this. His voice rang out,"If I escape once, there will be a second time. Moreover, you know that the heavenly Daoist temple is prepared for me to comprehend the myriad DAOs. If I escape, it will be too difficult to comprehend the myriad DAOs. Compared with you, what I lack is time!""The heavenly Daoist Rite can at least save me a lot of time, a thousand years, ten thousand years ... Or even longer! In the primordial chaos, a thousand years or ten thousand years is nothing, but to me, wasting even a single day is wasting away my life. ""Why are you talking nonsense with him?"At this moment, venerable Lord Feng Ming's eyes were cold.""Daoist Samsara, kill them!"What was there to talk about?It didn't dare to say that it could take on three or two level eights at the same time, but it didn't have any difficulty.It and the earth Spirit alone would be able to surround the three level eight spiritual beasts!It would be too easy for the rest to deal with Li Hao and the others at the seventh step.Things might change if he delayed!"There's no hurry. "Samsara laughed. He looked into the distance. At this moment, his aura suddenly exploded. A powerful aura shook the heavens and earth. In the Eastern Region, the aura of a peak rank eight expert spread in all directions. His voice was like a huge wave, sweeping across the heavens and earth!"Extreme Ice, you've seen my sincerity! You ... It's time for you to make a move!"At this moment, in the distance, many grade 8 auras began to madly rise.One, two, three ...In the end, a total of 15 rank 8 auras swept in all directions. The entire Eastern Region seemed to be covered by the rank 8 aura.The next moment, one, two, three ...In the end, it wasn't just four rank eight auras, but five.The human King, the Paragon, Emperor Cang, the light, and ... The sun god!The first person in new martial arts, sun god, who had reached Level Seven venerable sovereign even earlier than human King realm, had also burst out with level eight aura this time.Five grade 8 powerhouses, facing three times the number of grade 8 powerhouses.In fact, it looked even more serious than Li Hao 's.However, at this moment, the human King was fearless. His voice reverberated over with madness and fearlessness. His maniacal laughter resounded in all directions. The distance between the two wasn't too far. The human King laughed heartily,"Li Hao, I'll help you after I kill these weak chickens! You've held on. A group of scattered soldiers and brave Wanderers dare to go against my neo martial?"So what if the enemy was three times his number?He was very strong, and the Supremes weren't weak either. Light was a veteran rank eight venerable sovereign, so he wasn't considered weak. He was just a little weaker than Samsara and the others. Although there were many enemies, the human King thought that as long as he could kill one or two of the grade-8 enemies in the East, they would be defeated!At this moment, Li Hao didn't respond.As for the Samsara Emperor, he revealed a faint smile and looked at Li Hao."I'm afraid neo martial can't help you at all! Of course, it's difficult for Extreme Ice to keep neo martial, even if ... Extreme Ice isn't weak. "  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ   He smiled and said,"Li Hao, as expected, long Zhan and the others might be nearby. You actually have no way out. As far as I know, you control time because of the time seed you obtained from Xin Wu. As long as you hand it over, I won't kill you. Instead, I will help you eliminate long Zhan! I know that you once had a blood feud with the primordial chaos race!"At this moment, he was actually trying to win Li Hao over.And he seemed to care more about long Zhan.The tier 8 powerhouses around him were somewhat dissatisfied. Everyone had come to deal with Li Hao. Of course, Li Hao, who had handed over the time seed, was not scary. Long Zhan was indeed more worthy of attention.That was a top-notch expert!Samsara strode over as if he was having fun. At this moment, he wasn't looking down on Li Hao. It was because he had too much of an advantage. He didn't look down on Li Hao, but he didn't really need to fear a rank seven venerable sovereign.As the strongest Man in the East, he had his own pride.Last time, Li Hao had ruined his plan to kill the human King. He felt regretful and hateful. But now, he had the absolute advantage. In the distance, the battle had even begun.A total of 20 rank eight auras shook the entire world.On this side, there were more than 10 type 8 auras. More than 30 type 8 experts were fighting hun Dun. This was unprecedented in the past million years.The voice of the reincarnation monarch was loud and clear,"long Zhan!" I know you're nearby! Your thoughts are known by the chaos! But today, the trend of the times has changed. Do you ... Really want to get involved?"Without a sound.Long Zhan seemed to have completely disappeared, or he simply did not come.However, both Li Hao and Samsara were certain that this guy was nearby.The distance must not be far.At that moment, as Samsara approached, some of the rank seven venerable sovereigns of the middle world Alliance were already sweating profusely. They were extremely nervous and some even took a few steps back.Previously, he had said that he would fight for everyone's future ...They were afraid to face these top existences.Myriad transformations Emperor was also very nervous. At this moment, he glanced at the people around him and his expression changed slightly. These guys ... They might not be able to withstand such an invisible pressure.The middle world Alliance had a total of six rank seven venerable sovereigns. Wanqiu, who had just advanced, and myriad transformations, who was a veteran at the peak of rank seven, could even fight a rank eight if the six of them joined forces.If these people were to collapse ...Myriad incarnations frowned and looked at Li Hao uneasily. It seemed ... That he had no way to save himself.
