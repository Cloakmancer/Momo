y back.
 Li Hao had been frowning.
 Liu Long was also frowning.
 Wang Ming was very puzzled when he saw the two frowning in silence. What was going on?
 "You guys ... Haven't gotten enough?"
 Wang Ming asked.
 Li Hao came back to his senses, shook his head, and said,""I remember that my teacher is missing! The point is ... Did I lose something else?"
 What?
 The two of them were puzzled.
 "Probably. Liu Yan ... Did she go back? or did she go to the White moon City? I forgot to ask!" Liu Long sighed.
  He had lost Liu Yan!
 Li Hao wasn't worried about Liu Yan. She would definitely be fine since hou Xiaochen was there.
 The key was ... Losing the dog!
 "Where's Heibao?"
 Li Hao thought of Black Panther and said with a frown,""This guy disappeared after we went to the transverse Canyon. I didn't see it when I went in or when I came out ... Did it get lost?"
 Liu Long also thought of Heibao, the dog who had learned his ninth-form strength.
 At this moment, he was also very regretful,'probably ... He was killed and eaten by someone for hot pot? There are many experts here this time, and this dog looks like he has thick skin. If we don't handle it well, he might be targeted and killed. "
 Li Hao glanced at Liu Long. Boss's words were not unreasonable.
 But ... I'm the one who raised the Black Panther!
 It ate a lot of my sword energy!
 "If it's killed and eaten by others ... That would be too much of a loss. I didn't even want to eat it.
 But the Black Panther didn't appear. Li Hao didn't know if it had run away or what. He could only sigh. Forget it. He had already lost his teacher, so why would he care about losing a dog?
 The car drove on slowly.
 This was the car he had driven here last time. He didn't expect that no one would steal it ... Well, those who came here were either strong or even stronger. Who would want a car?
 Just as he was driving, suddenly, a person jumped out in front of him!
 Li Hao's eyes flickered, and Wang Ming quickly stopped the car.
 A Martial Master!
 If they were superpowers, Li Hao would have noticed them long ago. Only martial masters could appear instantly without them noticing.
 When he looked again ... He saw a face that was almost stuck to the car window. He had an unkempt beard, and he knew who it was with one look.
 Southern Fist!
 In the past, he was the king of the southern Fist, one of the two fist Kings of Silver Moon.
 He Yong!
 When hou Xiaochen had attacked him, this guy had been so scared that he had run away. He hadn't expected him to appear now.
 Liu Long and Wang Ming instantly jumped out of the car, both extremely alert and shocked. This guy was so bold. He had appeared right after hou Xiaochen had left. Was he going to attack them?
 In Silver Moon, was he not afraid of hou Xiaochen's anger?
  "Senior Southern Fist, what business do you have with me?" Liu Long's voice was also grave.  He Yong glanced at him and his eyes moved slightly,""Qian Dou? He was also a Martial Master! Kid, what's your name?"
 "Liu Long!"
 "Liu Long?"
 He Yong thought for a while and smiled,"Yin Qiang's son, right?" I didn't expect that after your father died, you'd advance to the Qian warrior stage. It seems that you've taken quite a lot of Scriptures from demon Yuan. "
 Without Yuan Shuo's guidance, he did not think that the others from Silvermoon would be able to easily step into the thousand warrior tier.
 This was especially true for Liu Long, who was a second generation martial artist.
 Yes, this was the second generation of martial arts.
 Liu Long had not experienced the great storms of that year. That was the era of turbulent winds and waves.
 "But you can 't!"
 He Yong was very arrogant and didn't take him seriously. As for Wang Ming from riyao, he couldn't even be bothered to look him in the eye.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com When Li Hao got out of the car, He Yong didn't try to hide anything and said directly,""Little guy, take me to your master!"
 "I can't find it."
 Li Hao shook his head.
 He Yong laughed."That's fine. You're his last disciple. Even if you can't find him, he'll come to find you sooner or later!" I'm not in a hurry, I'll wait for him!"
 "Senior is looking for my master ..." Li Hao frowned.
 "Sparring!"
 He Yong was extremely arrogant."I want to see the power of an accumulation God Martial Master!"
 "Sun Yifei died in battle. He was at the late stage of the three yang realm ..."
 Li Hao reminded him. He had actually guessed it.
 These senior martial masters didn't seem to be afraid of death. They really wanted to see the power of the Spirit accumulation.
 When he Yong said those words on the cliff, he actually had a vague intention of protecting Li Hao. Perhaps he didn't want to see the inheritance of martial arts end.
 Of course, it was not obvious.
 Li Hao didn't have a bad impression of these martial masters, but they were too aggressive and annoying at times.
 "So what?" He Yong sneered. Sun Yifei's eyebrow-raising stick had long been destroyed, and he was just a fake Martial Master! I'm a real warrior of the Qian dynasty, and I've been in this realm for many years. I've changed my blood three times, and my bones are strong. Do you think I'm an ordinary warrior of the Qian dynasty?"
  "It's true that I couldn't find the way to the thousand warrior realm, but I haven't been crippled all these years!"He said arrogantly. In the royal family, there was nothing but many treasures. He strengthened his bones, changed his blood flow, and even absorbed a large number of divine power stones. These are all beyond your imagination!"
 "It's true that old demon Yuan killed sun Yifei ... But I don't believe that he can defeat me!"
 He was confident that even if he could not defeat Yuan Shuo, he would not be completely helpless.
 He didn't find the way to accumulate spirit, but he didn't stay idle in the imperial family.
 He had consumed countless treasures.
 His muscles and bones were strong, and his blood Qi was strong.
 In fact, Li Hao could feel that this guy was very powerful, even stronger than him ... It was just a feeling.
 Although Li Hao had just advanced to the warrior Qian level, he had comprehended the earth sword force and absorbed a large amount of mysterious energy to strengthen his five internal organs.
 He might not be a match for the current Yuan Shuo, but he might be on par with the yuan Shuo who had just advanced.
 At that time, his teacher had also advanced and started a battle with the three suns. The bloody blade technique had erupted and killed an early stage three sun.

 The current Li Hao should be able to do the same!
 Of course, whether he could or could not, he would only know after the battle.
 However, the fellow before him felt that he was even stronger than him. It was clear that he did have some skills.
 Seeing that Li Hao seemed to be deep in thought, He Yong impatiently said,""Kid, what are you considering? If you can't find your master, I'll follow you!"
 Li Hao smiled."Sure! I'll go to white moon City in three days. Senior, you can come with me!"
 He Yong's expression changed.
 Hou Xiaochen!
 He snorted,"don't use hou Xiaochen to scare me. Do you think you're afraid of him?" As long as he doesn't rebel, he's still a member of the dynasty. He dares to kill me?"
 "If they really want to rebel ... Then there's no other way!"
 He Yong mumbled and said,"there's no use scaring him. Unless your master comes out, I won't leave!"
  "Uncle Hong is also nearby ..."
 "Supertrash, get lost. I'm not interested in him!"
 He Yong cursed. He was very dissatisfied with earth overturning sword becoming a super.
 Liu Long furrowed his brows. This time, he spoke,"Senior, isn't it a little inappropriate to force others? We still have official business to attend to, so we don't have time to play with senior ..."
 "Playing around?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "What?!" He Yong was furious and roared,"since Yuan Shuo has broken through to the spirit accumulation stage, he has shown the world the strength of his martial arts. Why is he not willing to show himself for a battle?"
 Li Hao said in a deep voice,"too many people want to kill my master. Senior, aren't you forcing my master to come out and court death?" Is this what senior is thinking? In order to satisfy his own selfish desires, he forced my master to come out and fight. By then, how many people would kill him?"
 He Yong was slightly stunned, but he quickly said arrogantly,""What are you afraid of? Whoever comes will be killed!"
 “……”
 Li Hao and the others were speechless. This guy was crazy.
 Kill who?
 Who Do You Think You Are?
 He Yong was not crazy. He sneered."What are you looking at me for?" With hou Xiaochen's rebellion and Silvermoon's rebellion, Yuan Shuo has been under his protection for many years, so of course he'll have to work for him. With hou Xiaochen here, who would dare to kill Yuan Shuo?"
 Li Hao frowned, and Wang Ming also said unhappily,"What nonsense are you talking about? our Minister is dedicated to the public. What do you mean by rebelling? don't think that you can spread rumors just because you're from the royal family!"
 "Little brat, what do you know!"
 "If hou Xiaochen doesn't rebel today, he'll rebel sooner or later!" He Yong sneered. If he doesn't rebel, he'll have to go to the central region. The nine divisions can't tolerate such a powerful existence sitting at the border, watching the Tigers fight and waiting for the right time!"
 "Even if we force hou Xiaochen to rebel, we'll force him to go to the central continent. If he doesn't go, it'll be a rebellion!"
 "In fact, in order to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys ... He, hou Xiaochen, will have to be the chicken! Yes, it's very troublesome that someone is openly rebelling. A single spark can start a Prairie Fire, but once it's extinguished in an instant, it'll terrorize everyone and the dynasty will benefit instead!"
 In an instant, Li Hao and the others were moved.  To force hou Xiaochen to rebel!
 That's right, everyone was thinking that the dynasty would not dare to do this. Once they forced a high-ranking official to rebel, what would happen to other places?
 But ... The important figures of the dynasty were not stupid.
 What if he could quickly kill hou Xiaochen?
 The first rebel King, the one who had killed Xu Guang with a single spear, had been instantly annihilated after his rebellion. At that time, would anyone still have the same thoughts?
 Even if they did, they wouldn't dare to reveal it so easily.
 Killing the chicken to warn the monkeys!
 So, according to He Yong, the dynasty would definitely continue to force hou Xiaochen into the central continent. If he didn't go ... He might really be convicted of treason!
 None of them had actually thought about this before.
 He always felt that it would not be like this. The dynasty would not dare to do this. Once the border was in chaos, it would not be just one or two places.
 However, at this moment, He Yong mentioned another possibility!
 Seeing that they were silent, He Yong laughed,""What, did you get scared after saying a few words? Don't worry, it won't be that fast. Even if we do force hou Xiaochen to rebel, there'll be a procedure. We'll talk first, and after that, we'll announce it to the world!"
 "I'll promote him to the Deputy Minister of the night patrol, the kind from the headquarters! Tomorrow, he would be the commander of the night patrollers! The day after tomorrow, he'll enter the inspector's office and become the first assistant ... If he still doesn't go after three challenges ... That'll be a rebellion!"
 "There are procedures in dynasty's work. We can't just do as we please."
 He Yong laughed."Of course, we can't rule out the possibility of some people causing trouble in Silver Moon and forcing that guy to rebel. That's even simpler. As long as we're prepared, we can quickly exterminate him!"
 Li Hao frowned slightly but didn't say anything. He simply changed the topic again."Senior, I really don't know where my master is. If you're willing ... Then you can follow me!"
 "No news at all?" He Yong frowned. I heard that he was injured. Could he have died on the way?"
 Li Hao laughed."You must be joking, senior. My teacher is a scholar and a master in martial arts. How could he die in a nameless place?"
  "That's good!"
 He Yong's eyes were cold."I really can't bear to see him die. That old devil had caused us a lot of trouble back then!"
 Li Hao was too lazy to pay attention to him.
 He didn't like or reject this person.
 It didn't matter if they followed.
 Martial masters, some people were just so stubborn!
 He got into the car. Seeing this, He Yong also wanted to get in. Li Hao was a little stunned."Senior is also in the carriage? It's best for a Martial Master to walk ..."
 "Why?" He Yong was stunned.
 Why did he have to walk?
 Li Hao explained,"walking can greatly prevent sneak attacks. This is what my teacher said. We're all half-baked, so it doesn't matter. I feel that senior is an expert, and he was quite famous in Silver Moon back then. He might have enemies, so if he's ambushed ... He'll die an unjust death! Senior, we'll drive slowly. You can just follow behind and exercise your muscles. "

 He Yong thought about it and felt that it made sense. Martial masters did like to walk.
 But ... The Silver City was more than a thousand miles away.
 Although he was strong, but ... He would also be exhausted to death!
 Seeing this, Li Hao said,"senior, could it be that the boxing champion is only good at fist techniques? I understand. Get in the car, senior!" "My master is all-rounded, and he usually walks because he's good at the five birds technique. Whether it's fist, palm, or Qinggong footwork, they're all first-class. When we came here before, he only walked and didn't fall behind at all. He followed us all the time. I thought senior was also good at footwork, and only then did I remember that senior is the king of Southern boxing, not Southern legs!"
 “……”
 He Yong looked at him and sneered after a while,""Who are you looking down on? A true Martial Master was all-rounded, they just specialized in different areas! Get lost, I'll follow you!"
 Li Hao gestured for Wang Ming to drive.
 He left!
 He had nothing to say to this person.
 The other party was certain that they could find Yuan Shuo by following Li Hao, so they wouldn't give up easily unless they beat him up. But Li Hao was a low-key person who respected the elderly. Why would he do such a thing?
  Of course, it was also because this guy was poor.
 There was no benefit in killing a Martial Master.
 Seeing that he was all alone and didn't bring anything, he only had a pair of fists. Was he supposed to kill him, cut his fists, and put them on?
 The car started moving quickly.
 Behind them, He Yong was not in a hurry to follow. He just watched silently for a while and snorted. After a while, he ran into the distance and pushed a motorcycle out from behind a rock ...
 Yes, a motorcycle!
 With a buzz, He Yong got into the car and quickly gave chase!
 Little brat, do you think I'm a fool?
 More than a thousand miles ... I'm f * cking crazy.
 No matter how strong a Martial Master was, he wouldn't be able to react in time if he was ambushed after running so far away. If he didn't want to help, he could have just said so. Why did he have to resort to this? he's the same as his master, they're both bad people.
 ……
 In the car.
 Li Hao looked back and didn't see that guy, but he didn't care.
 "Boss, do you know anything about the southern style?" he asked Liu Long.
 "I'm just average. He Yong of the southern Fist, his fist technique is godlike. My father once mentioned to me when I was young that He Yong was bold but careful. He might look like a boorish man, but he was actually a shrewd person. "
 "After the rise of the superpowers, He Yong disappeared. It seems like he had sneaked into the royal family to avoid the war of the superpowers. He was a Martial Master close to the thousand-man level after all. The Silver Moon Martial Master was still very popular back then. I don't know if he entered the royal family after he became a warrior of the Qian dynasty or before. If he entered later, then a warrior of the Qian dynasty would be very popular everywhere!"
  "Although the royal family has retreated behind the scenes, it's not like they've completely lost their prestige and wealth. The royal family still has some wealth and power in their hands, including the extremely famous black armored Army from back then. It's still under the control of the royal family."  The black armored Army!
 According to historical records, this was a powerful Army that ruled the world.
 "The royal family also made a name for themselves by excavating remains," Li Hao suddenly said."Doesn't the black armored Army sound a little similar to the black Phoenix?"
 "A little!"
 Liu Long nodded and said,"it's very similar. They both have invincible defense and are indestructible!" Back then, they were still mainly martial masters, and almost no one could break through their defenses. They swept through 99 provinces, and even silver Moon was quickly taken down. It can be seen how strong the other party is!"
 "He Yong has joined the royal family, and it looks like he's doing quite well," she added."The reason he came to Silver Moon this time is to spar with professor Yuan. He might have some other intentions."
 Liu Long was actually very meticulous and smart. Apart from Yuan Shuo, who looked down on him, Li Hao felt that he was quite good.
 Liu Long continued,"he's a representative of the royal family ... Minister hou has revealed his powerful strength this time. According to him, the nine divisions should either be forcibly conscripted or force Minister hou to rebel. He's representing the royal family ... Perhaps he wants to contact Minister hou!"
 This was not impossible.
 The royal family might not be willing to retreat behind the scenes.
 Li Hao's head ached when he heard that. It's getting more and more complicated. Isn't it good that Minister hou is in charge of Silver Moon? What did Jiusi think about? why did they have to transfer him away? aren't they looking for trouble?"
 Liu Long sighed,"that's normal. They are in different positions. If you were the Secretary of the ninth Division, would you be at ease letting an extremely powerful and prestigious expert guard the borders?" The point is, this person has disobeyed your orders several times. Do you think Jiusi can still be at ease?"
 Peace of mind my ass!
 Hou Xiaochen not going to the central continent was the biggest problem.
 At that moment, Wang Ming, who was driving, couldn't help but say,"Minister ... Why don't you want to go to the central region? If we go there, we might have more opportunities. To be honest, Silver Moon is a waste of talent. "
  Li Hao and the others didn't know why hou Xiaochen didn't go to the central region.
 Protecting Silver Moon and keeping watch over him was perhaps only one of the reasons.
 It didn't mean that it was all because of this!
 If he was truly worried about Silver Moon, he could just go to the central continent and get a few more people to take care of him.
 There might be some other factors that Li Hao and the others didn't know about, and they couldn't be bothered to guess.
 Li Hao didn't care about this. At this moment, he was counting his gains.
 35 divine power stones.
 There were 800 cubic meters of water energy in the ring. After flying sunlit's death, Wang Ming had collected nearly 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy, and after killing the three Crimson moons just now, he had collected about 800 cubic meters.
 This time, he had about 2600 cubic meters of mysterious energy left.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The origin divine weapon was broken into two, and Liu Long and Wang Ming each took half.

 As for himself, he had absorbed about 600 cubic meters of wood, fire, and water, while he had absorbed about 400 cubic meters of metal and earth. This was also a huge harvest.
 Moreover, he had also eaten six sun illumination Blood God's clones.
 Yes, he had just finished three more. Although they were not Blood God clones, the red shadow was actually the same. It was just that there was one less procedure. To Li Hao, there was not much difference.
 At this moment, his qi and blood were boiling, and his inner strength was strong.
 It was ten times stronger than when he had just left!
 They left Silver City on August 26th. They fought sun Yifei on the 27th and entered the ruins on the 28th. It was already the 1st.
 1st of September!
 In fact, it had only been five days.
 However, in these five days, Li Hao's strength had undergone a tremendous change.
 "Of teacher's five internal organs, his heart has absorbed more than one thousand cubic meters of fire energy. Moreover, he has been nourishing his five internal organs for decades, so I can't compare to him. The other four internal organs can bear it. In my opinion, it's at least five hundred cubic meters ... In other words, teacher's heart might have absorbed as much as one thousand five hundred cubic meters of fire energy ..."
  This was a comparison to himself!
 In other words, Li Hao had absorbed about 500 cubic meters before he could reach the level that Yuan Shuo hadn 't.
 Therefore, he was still lacking compared to Yuan Shuo.
 He looked at the storage ring in his hand, then felt the divine power Stone in his body ...
 Li Hao's eyes flickered. This time, the five elements were balanced. If they could reach the standard of 1000 cubic meters, they should be almost the same as teacher's five internal organs.
 At that time, what he lacked was momentum!
 At that time, if he could cultivate more forces and merge them with his sword force, perhaps ... He would be the next one to accumulate spirit!
 "Fire, water, and wood are 400 cubic meters each. Metal and earth are 600 cubic meters each ... A total of 2400 cubic meters of mysterious energy."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The mysterious energy was almost enough, provided that he didn't give it to Wang Ming and Liu Long.
 As for the divine power Stone, Li Hao was considering whether it could be replenished with sword energy. Sword energy was the key. He really couldn't afford to raise it with an original divine weapon!
 In fact, he could not afford to keep a divine power Stone.
 But now, there were at least 35 of them.
 In his previous contact with hou Xiaochen, he had revealed two sword intents and his ability as a warrior of thousands to show his value. Now that he had been exposed, Li Hao needed to quickly improve his strength so that the information these people had would forever be in the past!
 Thinking of this, Li Hao said,"boss, I still need 400 cubic meters of water energy, 400 cubic meters of fire energy, 400 cubic meters of wood energy ..."
 Li Hao was satisfied with all three of them.
 Li Hao didn't wait for them to speak and continued,""There are only about 200 cubic meters of metal energy and about 400 cubic meters of earth energy ... I'll take these first. They're about 1800 cubic meters."
 "For the remaining 800 cubic meters of mysterious energy, mainly water energy and a small amount of fire energy, boss, you can split it 500 cubic meters, and the remaining 300 will be given to Wang Ming ..."
 Wang Ming didn't say anything as he drove. 300 cubic meters was actually pretty good.
 He didn't actually do much.
 Of course, Li Hao took more because he killed more.
 "I want metal energy!" He said with some resentment.
 It was not a problem for Liu Long to get water energy, but was he supposed to give him the remaining fire energy?
 He wanted metal energy!  Li Hao said,"I have use for the metal energy. Also, absorb some of the five elements energy for me. It doesn't matter if you can't improve your strength. If you absorb too much metal energy, you'll die sooner or later!"
 "Why?"
 "The five internal organs are imbalanced!"
 Li Hao said in a deep voice,"cut the crap. This is what my teacher said, not me. If you don't believe me, go talk to my teacher."
 Alright!
 Wang Ming was a little speechless, but after some thought, Li Hao wasn't going to make things up.
 Of course, he could not rule out the possibility that this guy chose to deceive an honest man like him in order to not give him metal energy.
 Out of the 2600 cubic meters of mysterious energy, Li Hao had taken 1800 cubic meters!
 The few people present didn't feel that there was anything wrong.
 Li Hao calculated for a moment. In this case, he was still lacking 400 cubic meters of metal energy and 200 cubic meters of earth energy. This way, he could reach the standard of 1000 cubic meters.
 As for the 5000 cubic meters promised by the night watchman, he did not mention it now.
 We'll talk about it when we get to white moon City.
 If it didn't work, he would make up for it with divine power stones.
 Thinking of this, Li Hao opened his mouth and began to vomit ...
 Liu Long looked at it and was speechless. How disgusting!
 Of course, the idea he wanted to drag out was even more disgusting.
 Soon, Li Hao spat out more than ten divine power stones and said,""Including the three just now, there are a total of 35 of them, some big and some small. With the size of a marble as a unit, we can probably divide them into 50 marble-sized divine power stones."
 These divine power stones were of different sizes, so they could only be distinguished in this way.
 "I'll get 25, boss 15, and old Wang 10. Any objections? If you have any opinions, just say it. "
 This time, Li Hao was in charge of the distribution.
 He was the one who killed the Yama's men.
 He was also the one who killed the three people just now.
  Therefore, he was not polite when he distributed them.
 "No objections!" Wang Ming beamed.
 In fact, his greatest contribution was not in this, but in killing Zhang Ting. He had taken the initiative twice and created opportunities for them. Thus, Li Hao had taken this into account when distributing the rewards. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been qualified to get so much, according to the subsequent contributions.
 "Sure!" Liu Long nodded slightly.
 Li Hao stopped talking. He took out a divine power Stone and stuck it on the small sword, but ... There was no reaction!
 Li Hao's expression changed.
 Did it not work, or was the method wrong?
 The black shadow that had eaten the little snake and Qiao Feilong's wife had been devoured by the small sword.
 Why couldn't the divine power Stone do the same?
 He frowned. If it did not work, the sword energy might not be enough for him to raise his five viscera to 1000 cubic meters. That would be very troublesome.

 "Don't tell me ... I have to use a sword to break it?"
 The divine power Stone could store energy inside without letting it leak out.
 Perhaps, he needed to break it.
 Li Hao was also a decisive person. Without saying anything, he cut the divine power Stone open with his sword, and rich earth-elemental energy overflowed.
 At this moment, the small sword seemed to move slightly.
 But ... He still had no interest in it and did not absorb it.
 Li Hao was anxious!
 This didn't work?
 Thinking of something, he used the five animals breathing technique. At this moment, the small sword seemed to be active, and sword energy gushed out ... But Li Hao didn't absorb the sword energy. Instead, he controlled the small sword to touch the earth energy.
 This time ... It had some effect!
  The small sword seemed to have just sensed the presence of this energy and absorbed some of it.
 However, she seemed to dislike it.
 After a short while, there was still a lot of energy left in the car. It was like some impurities.
 Li Hao's eyes flickered as he came to a realization.
 The starry sky sword despised this energy for being too impure!
 But ... Tsk!
 This was a divine power Stone, the purest mysterious energy in the world today. Many people were reluctant to use it.
 It was no wonder that the small sword had never been interested in mysterious energy.
 Even the divine power Stone wasn't pure enough, let alone the mysterious energy. It was probably trash to the small sword!
 Li Hao had a headache!
 However, at least he had absorbed some of it. Li Hao sensed that the sword energy seemed to be a little denser, but it didn't suddenly explode like when he had absorbed the original God weapon.
 "AI!"
 Li Hao sighed and was speechless.
 'Forget it. It's better to be useful than useless. At least I can absorb a part of it. The remaining part can actually be used too. It feels like it's about the same as an ordinary earth-type mystic energy.'
 Sword energy can be purified ... Li Hao suddenly had an idea. After purification, will the small sword absorb it?
 But on second thought ... Then I'm an idiot, right?
 The function of the sword energy was to purify and strengthen it. The purified elemental energy had already consumed a lot of the sword energy. Even if he absorbed it and recovered some sword energy ... Wouldn't he be left with nothing?
 He had wasted his sword energy and his mysterious energy!
 In the end, the sword energy maintained the balance, but the mysterious energy was gone ... What was the point?
 Giving up on this tempting idea, Li Hao stopped thinking about it and started to absorb the earth energy left behind after the fragments shattered. In the car, Wang Ming and Liu Long were both absorbing it. Although earth energy wasn't their main cultivation, what did it matter?
 It was fine as long as it was not wasted!
 Li Hao didn't stay idle in the car. He cultivated all the way.
 Wang Ming drove the car, and he Yong followed from a distance, so he didn't disturb them.
 ……
 At the same time.  Just as Li Hao and the others were returning to the Silver City ...
 There was another province near Silver Moon called the riverbank province. It was crossed by a large river that spanned across more than ten provinces.
 And the river's origin was within the Linjiang province.
 The river's name was cloud River, the river above the clouds. Its source was on a tall mountain, as if it was located in the clouds.
 The mountain where the source was located was called Cloud Mountain.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The cloud Mountain was shrouded in clouds all year round and rarely visited.
 Today, an old man came. His body was light, and with one step, he crossed dozens of meters in an instant. The tall Cloud Mountain could not stop his pace. Not long after, the old man climbed to a platform halfway up the cloud Mountain.
 ? The platform was covered with fallen leaves and some stones, which were not very clean.
 "Old friend, are you still here?"
 The old man strode over and shouted, full of energy.
 A moment later, a ray of sword light flashed over.
 A sword fell from the sky!
 The old man threw out a punch that was like the roar of a Tiger. The next moment, the heart fire ape appeared and punched again. With a loud bang, the sword light dissipated and a human figure appeared.
 "Hahaha, the Jade light sword is still so brutal!"
 Yuan Shuo laughed and looked at the man,""You're so polite to an old friend?"
 In front of him was a woman who looked to be less than forty years old.
 His eyes were cold!
 "Old demon Yuan, you're not dead yet!" She looked at Yuan Shuo and said coldly.
 "How can it be that fast!"
 "Have you heard the news?" Yuan Shuo asked with a smile.
 "What?"
 "I've reached the level above thousand-hands, the spirit accumulation realm!"
 "So what?" the woman coldly replied.
 Even though he said that, his eyes still revealed a hint of surprise. No wonder this guy was so powerful and broke the Emerald light sword with one punch.
  Yuan Shuo sneered,"so what?" Of course it was different! Didn't the Jade light sword want to step into the spirit accumulation stage and display the might of the Silver Moon martial forest? You've been hiding in the cloud mountains for so many years, waiting for death here?"
 "I see that you still haven't given up on martial arts. Then, you'll come out again and kill them all!"
 Yuan Shuo was now full of demonic nature. He laughed heartily, and his appearance was completely different from before. He no longer had the kind expression he had when he treated Li Hao. His face was cold and stern. "You've stepped into the Qian warrior realm. I can see that your sword is powerful. It seems like you're not crippled ..."
 The woman frowned."Speak. Who do you want to kill? what do you want?"
 "Hunt down the Crimson Moon!"
 Yuan Shuo chuckled,"kill, strengthen yourself!" Ying Hongyue, this little brat, was too arrogant! Back then, you forced me to hide in the Silver City. He cultivated a type of red shadow. Swallow it to strengthen your Qi, blood, and inner strength. If you eat 30 to 50 solar illumination realm pills or three to five three sun realm pills, your five organs will be strengthened, and I'll teach you how to accumulate spirit!"
 "Why me?"
 The woman was incomparably cold as she looked at him with ill intent.
 "Why did I look for you?"
 "There are too many enemies in the Silver Moon martial forest, so it's not easy to find someone else. They're either too weak, or they're dead, or they've become supers ... You're still holding on with your Azure light sword all these years, and you've never given up on the martial Dao. More importantly ... I could've killed you when we sparred back then, but I didn't because you're pretty. You owe me your life!"

 “……”
 He was speechless!
 If he wasn't killed, he would owe him a life. Was this correct?
 It was barely ... Correct!
 Jade light sword took a deep breath and said in a deep voice,"Wait a moment, I'll pack my things. Also, tell me your destination ..."
 "Do you know where Hong Yue is in Linjiang?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I know a little."
 "Kill the ones on this side first, then kill your way through, all the way to the central region. If everything goes smoothly, you'll be at the level of spirit accumulation in the central region! If it doesn't go well, we'll both die. "
 "I know."
 The aquamarine light sword instantly disappeared. With a leap, it disappeared from the platform.
  Yuan Shuo chuckled. It had been so many years, but this woman's figure was still so good ... Cough, cough, why would a Martial Master think about this? it was fine as long as she still had her strength. It was just a matter of whether she had it or not.
 The Azure light sword, Wu Hongjun.
 One of the Seven Swords!
 Now, out of the Seven Swords, three were confirmed to be dead. Only the heaven sword, the earth-overturning sword, and the Azure light sword were still alive. As for whether the light sword was still alive, Yuan Shuo had no idea.
 North and South double punch, Silver Moon triple spear ...
 Now, there were not many who survived.
 Also, the eyebrow-raising staff was dead, and it was unknown if the crippled feet was still alive ...
 As he was thinking, he thought of another person. Was BA Dao still alive?
 There were many Silvermoon swordsmen, but there were also many swordsmen.
 After BA Dao left Silver Moon that year, there was no news of him. If that guy was still alive, they could cooperate. That guy was also extremely violent and audacious when it came to killing people. There was actually no news of him after all these years ... It was really F * cking strange. If he was not dead, then everyone who had seen him had been killed by him!
 Just as he was thinking, Wu Hongjun jumped down, carrying a small bag and holding a sword in his hand. It seemed that he was ready to go out of the mountain with them.
 It was that simple!
 To a swordsman and a Martial Master, when Yuan Shuo told her to kill and advance to the spirit accumulation stage ... She didn't hesitate much.
 Then go kill!
 Which of Silver moon's surviving martial masters did not have their hands covered in blood?
 She was no exception!
 "Let's go!"  Wu Hongjun opened his mouth, and Yuan Shuo laughed and said,""He's so fast. Martial masters are so straightforward. If it were any other woman, it would take a few hours to clean her up ..."
 "You talk too much nonsense!"
 Wu Hongjun's face was cold."I'm not your opponent now. If I step into the spirit accumulation stage, your head will fall to the ground under the blue light sword!"
 "What are you saying ..."
 Yuan Shuo laughed arrogantly,""I'm afraid you won't be able to cut it! To be honest, the Azure light sword's destructive power is just average, and it's not as powerful as the dead Luo shengjian. If it wasn't for the fact that that fellow Tian Jian seemed to have gone to the central region, I wouldn't even bother to look for you. "
 Wu Hongji didn't say anything. Heavenly Sword ... The strongest one among the Seven Swords. She really couldn't compare with him.
 However, she thought of something and said coldly,""Just wait and see. My jadesword technique has improved a lot over the years, and ... I've discovered some secrets. I'm afraid that this is only the beginning of my family's swordsmanship!"
 "A family-inherited Sword Art?"
 Yuan Shuo's interest was piqued,"your swordsmanship is passed down from your ancestors?" I've never heard of it. Your family isn't a martial arts aristocratic family. "
 "I dug it out myself!"
 Wu Hongshan glanced at him and said coldly,""When I was young, my parents passed away and I didn't have money to bury them. I dug up my ancestral grave and buried my parents ... Then I found this sword manual!"
 Yuan Shuo was speechless.
 Was it?
 He really didn't know about this. So he had dug it out.
 That's amazing!
 This woman was indeed not a kind person. She had dug up her ancestors 'graves when she was young. She was really not human.
  He didn't say anything, and the two of them quickly flew down.
 Yuan Shuo only felt that the sky was clear and it was a good day to kill. From today onwards, his name would not only resound in Silver Moon, but everyone outside of Silver Moon would also know that he, Yuan Shuo, had returned!
 Behind him, Wu Hongji's face was still cold. He thought of some records in the sword manual, and his eyes also became bright.
 The Azure light sword was no ordinary sword technique.
 There were some scattered records in the sword manual. This was also an extremely powerful sword technique from the ancient civilization. In the past, the master of this sword technique had even followed the legendary human King ... Of course, who the human King was, what his strength was, how powerful he was ... All of these were not important.
 More importantly, it was said that there was an even stronger sword technique above the Azure light sword!
 It was said that the owner of the Azure light sword might have been his ancestor. He also had a junior, known as the longevity Swordmaster, who was unparalleled in killing. He wondered if the longevity sword had been lost.
 Of course, these were only some sporadic records in the ancient books, which had long been incomplete, but it still made Wu Hongji's blood boil.
 The Jade light sword was only the beginning!
 She would definitely make the Emerald light sword famous again!

 The neighboring province was too far away.
 The furthest Li Hao had ever been in his life was the Hengduan Canyon. Right now, all he wanted to do was go home.
 Although Silver City was small, it still had some warmth.
 After his childhood friend died, his teacher was still by his side. Now that his teacher had left, Li Hao wasn't too lonely. At the very least, he got to know the members of the demon hunting squad. The captain was a good person.
 The worn-out carriage finally entered the Silver City.
 This small town was as peaceful as ever.
 Without Li Hao and Yuan Shuo, very few people would come to disturb this small border town. Even if an ordinary Yue Ming came, she probably wouldn't be able to leave.
 By the time they returned to Silver City, the sky was already bright, and it was almost noon.
 The Silver City didn't have any walls, and it wasn't an ancient building. It was open on all sides, and anyone could enter at will.
 He had just returned from the ruins and was still feeling a little uncomfortable after returning to Silver City.
  It was as if the shops on both sides of the street could not be exited after entering.
 The small car drove all the way to the inspection Office.
 When the vehicle arrived at the inspection Office, the first person they saw was not the team, but mu Sen.
 It was unknown if this inspector was waiting for them or if he had accidentally bumped into them.
 Seeing Liu Long and the others get out of the car, mu Sen glanced at them and smiled,""I'm back!"
 Liu Long slightly nodded.
 He was neither warm nor cold to this fatty, treating him like a passerby.
 Mu Sen, on the other hand, was very enthusiastic. He looked at Li Hao and laughed."Deputy Minister Li, I heard that you're going to white moon City in a few days? Congratulations!"
 He was really well-informed.
 When hou Xiaochen told them about last night's incident, not many people actually knew about it. However, this person had received the news in advance. He really didn't become the head of the inspection Division for nothing.
 "It's just a bystander in the past, being a Secretary is still the most comfortable!"
 Li Hao also laughed and glanced at mu Sen. Before he advanced to the Qian combat stage, he actually couldn't see anything.
 After he advanced to the thousand-player level, he even began to build up his spirit. Li Hao could vaguely see something.
 This person ... Was powerful!
 At the very least, he had broken through 100. As for whether he had a Qian warrior, it was not clear for now.
 Seeing Li Hao looking at him, mu Sen laughed and said,""Minister li, stop looking. We're all on the same side from now on. It doesn't seem to make much sense to look. Let Me Reintroduce Myself. I am mu Sen, a member of the Silver Moon guards. Please excuse me!"
 “……”
 Li Hao was dumbfounded.  The Wei Wu Army?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He had only heard of the star Army, the official organization that had wiped out the pugilistic world. It was said that hou Xiaochen might have been one of the three great commanders.
 Now, this Secretary mu suddenly said this, something about the Silver Moon guards ... He was very confused.
 Liu Long also frowned and looked at him without saying anything.
 Mu Sen laughed."Don't ask. There's no need to ask. When you go to the White moon City, you will naturally know about this." Both of you are martial masters, so in the future, you will be on the same side. Silver Moon martial arts is very powerful, and everyone in the dynasty knows about it. After twenty years, has Silver Moon martial arts really been destroyed?"
 "Also, the two of you have also gone to the ruins ... When you find out that the night patrolmen have also obtained a batch of battle armors and entered the Wei Wu Army, you will naturally know about this," he said with a smile.
 Li Hao smiled, nodded, and didn't ask further.
 In fact, he had a general idea.
 There might be another organization among the night watchers ... Or rather, it was a structure left behind by the Heavenly Star military. It might be a force made up of martial masters, and the person in charge was most likely hou Xiaochen.
 Superpowers join the night patrollers, martial masters join the Wei Wu Army.
 It was said that the night patrols did not take in martial masters back then, but in reality, perhaps it was because martial masters did not advance to become supers and were all in the Wei Wu Army.
 Mu Sen was actually one of them ...
 Thinking about it carefully, it was at least over a hundred, so it was normal for him to be one of the members.
 It was just that ... This person had said it so openly. Was he certain that Li Hao and Liu Long would join?
 ,m But Wang Ming was still here!  Wang Ming was also speechless. Do I know too much?
 Mu Sen seemed to have seen it, but he did not care too much. He smiled and said,""The matter of the remains is already known to the public. The foundation of the Marquis's troops has almost been dug out. The armor has disappeared, and Crimson Moon and rising light have been killed ... The Wei Wu Army probably won't hide anymore. In fact, there's no need to hide."
  "Furthermore, they aren't too powerful. They are similar to the black armored Army of the royal family. There aren't many of them, and even now, they don't exceed a thousand. They aren't weak to Silver Moon, but to the entire dynasty, they are just a small army!"
 "You were waiting here just to say this?" Liu Long couldn't help but ask.
 Mu Sen laughed,"not entirely. Just a simple greeting and a simple self-introduction." Second, old Liu, you're already in the game. If you didn't tell us before, we wouldn't have known. If we had known that you've already entered the game, we would've had a few more drinks and a chat ..."
 "I don't drink!"
 "If you have something to say, then say it!" Liu Long replied coldly.
 "You really have a bad temper!" Mu Sen laughed.
 Mu Sen laughed. He was not embarrassed and said directly, "It's like this. There aren't many people in the Wei Wu Army, and there are even fewer Qian fighters. Of course, there are still some, but very few ... Old Liu, you've become a Qian fighter, so the Silver City might not let you stay. Your mission might be different from mine, and you might have to go to white moon City to take up a position ..."
 "I'm not leaving!"Liu Long frowned.
 He wanted to guard the Silver City!
 Mu Sen laughed."I don't have the final say. Besides, you were only worried that the Silver City would be attacked. But now, everyone's eyes are not on the Silver City. They are all on the side of Whitemoon city!" "Moreover, the night patrollers here aren't weak. Your team is all here. If you go to Whitemoon city, you can fight for more opportunities and resources ..."

 "Your personality and habits are the same as hou bu 'S. Hou bu is a rebel ... You want to learn from him?"
 “……”
 Liu Long was speechless. Now that he said it this way, it really did seem similar.
 The central government wanted hou Xiaochen to leave, but he didn 't.
 Now, if the White moon City transferred him away, and he didn't leave ... Then he would become an independent Silver City?
 Mu Sen laughed and said,"alright, this is not a definite thing. I'm just saying this in advance. There are not many people in the Wei Wu Army, and there are not many fighting Qian. If you enter, you might ... No, there is a high chance that you will become a Centurion!" If you become a Centurion, come and find my big brother. He has something to discuss with you ..."
 "Your big brother?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Yes, the assistant of the Wei Wu Army has also just barely stepped into the Qian warrior stage ..."
 Mu Sen chuckled,"it's not forming a gang. Don't worry. There are only so many people. Why would they form a gang? besides, we're all eating in the same pot. There should be something else that they want to talk to you about. There's nothing to be afraid of. Why would I harm you?"
 "Hehe!"
  Liu Long sneered, but that was hard to say.
 However, he did remember this matter and said perfunctorily,""We'll see. Besides, I'm not even sure if I'm leaving. The Silver City is my root!"
 "As you wish!"
 Mu Sen did not mind. He was just giving them a heads up and doing them a favor. At the very least, he had informed them of the situation.
 Li Hao, however, was a little curious. He smiled and said,""Secretary, what does the Wei Wu Army want to do? Could it be that we're going to capture and kill the martial masters who are causing trouble, just like we did in the past?"
 With the night watchmen, and the Wei Wu Army ... They wouldn't just keep it for the rest of their lives, right?
 "You'll know when you go in. "
 Mu Sen laughed."It's useless to say anything now. Minister li, do your best and do your best. In two years, I believe you will also be a Centurion. If your teacher returns ... I think that the commander of the Wei Wu Army will be him!"
 "Teacher probably isn't interested ..." Li Hao smiled.
 Become a commander?
 I can't even be a master!
 Of course, because he owed hou Xiaochen a favor and didn't fulfill his promise to hou Xiaochen, there was a high chance that his teacher would still help.
 However, this so-called Wei Wu Army ... Teacher probably hated them.
 After all, back then, the star martial guards had a bad reputation and the people of the martial arts world hated them.
 Li Hao didn't care. After all, whether it was the Wei Wu Army or the night patrol, they were all the same.
 Hou Xiaochen probably had the intention of breaking away from the system by creating the Wei Wu Army.
 Who cares!
 Mu Sen did not say anything more. After a few greetings, he left.
 ……
 After he left, Liu Long frowned and said,"don't listen to this fatty. It's all nonsense!" If you go to Whitemoon city, there's probably no other way. If I go to Whitemoon city ... I'll try my best to refuse, I don't want to go there!"
 He was still not willing to go.
 Li Hao didn't say anything. It was actually quite good that Liu Long didn't go.
 Silver City ... Li Hao couldn't just leave like that.
 The eight trigrams, the stone gate, the bloodline, the Crimson Moon ...
 There were too many secrets in Silver City that he needed to uncover!  How could he give up the Silver City? going to the White moon City was just to lie low for a while. When the storm was over, he would definitely come back.
 If Liu Long stayed in the Silver City, he could help guard the ruins.
 Liu Long also knew about that place.
 ……
 The three of them walked into the law enforcement building.
 The law enforcement building was frighteningly quiet.
 Li Hao and the others left. Not many people were left, and they didn't have any missions. At this moment, almost all of them were cultivating in the basement. The building was exceptionally quiet.
 Liu Yan probably didn't return. It might not be safe for her to come back alone.
 There was a high probability that he had followed the night patrolman to Whitemoon city. He had not seen it before, but he had probably evacuated in advance because he was too weak.
 The three of them didn't go upstairs and went straight to the basement.
 ……
 As expected, they were all here.
 Li Meng and Hu Hao were also in the basement.
 When Liu Long pushed open the door and walked in, everyone was first on guard, then they were overjoyed!
 "The Boss Is Back!"
 "The Minister is back!"
 “……”
 The few of them hurriedly stepped forward, all of them very excited. However, after looking around for a while, they did not see Liu Yan ... And their faces instantly darkened.
 Liu Long smiled."Liu Yan is still alive. She went to white moon City. We came back first."
 As soon as he said that, everyone rejoiced again.
 It was good that he was alive!
 The relationship between demon hunting teams was still very good. Li Hao was considered the last to join the team. Previously, they had all worked together for several years and risked their lives. No one wanted to see their teammates die.
 From the back of the basement, yunyao also came out, still wearing glasses.
 When he saw them, he didn't really look at Li Hao and Liu Long, but at Wang Ming instead, and his expression changed slightly.
  So fast!
 Before he left, although Wang Ming had a big mouth, he hadn't had the time to say that he had reached the radiant sun realm, because he had left Yuan Shuo's house that day. After that guy had broken through to the radiant sun realm, he had directly gone into seclusion at the yuan family.
 "Captain Liu, Xiao Hao ..."
 Yun Yao also greeted her. When she heard that Liu Yan had gone to the White moon City, she didn't say anything and remained very quiet.
 Liu Long slightly nodded.
 "I got a lot of water-type mystic energy from the ruins, I'll give you some later ..."
 "No need!"
 Yunyao refused."We didn't go. It's distributed according to work. If we don't have any credit, it's not appropriate to share your mystery."
 Liu Long didn't say anything else. Sometimes, the members of the team were extremely eager for the mysterious ability, but sometimes, they were also very principled and were unwilling to take other people's things without putting in any effort.
 Liu Yan was just too eager for revenge. Otherwise, she wouldn't have dared to take the blood God's spawn from Li Hao.

 "The king's Department ... Is shining?" Hu Hao suddenly asked.
 It was at this moment that Wang Ming seemed to have found his sense of existence, and he immediately smiled."Yeah, he's advanced to the glorious sun!"
 "Really?"
 Li Meng's face was full of surprise and disbelief.""So fast?"
 Wang Ming chuckled."It's alright. It's just so-so. I'm only in the early stage of the sun glory realm. I'll probably need a few days to reach the middle stage. The improvement this time isn't too big."
 Was this even something a human would say?
 Li Hao glanced at him. This guy had been very low-key in front of him and boss, but now he was arrogant again.
 However ... Riyao was indeed worthy of Li Meng and the rest's envy.
 Wang Ming had finally found a chance to act. He had been dealt a heavy blow earlier when Li Hao and Liu Long had cheated, and Li Hao was stronger than him in battle. He hadn't had the chance to act, and he didn't have the face to do so. Now that he'd met the two Moon nether, he couldn't help but start to brag!
 Next, it was time for this guy to perform.
  The matter of the ruins was shaken by him, and everyone listened carefully, occasionally revealing a look of shock.
 Hei Teng was at the peak of the Dark Moon realm, and he could even kill a sunlit cultivator.
 Copper miasma, a solar flare expert.
 The Silver Phoenix could kill three suns.
 And finally, the Golden Lion ...
 At least this guy knew his limits and didn't say anything about killing Zhang Ting. Li Hao and Liu Long couldn't be bothered to care.
 Li Hao didn't want to hear any more of this. He stood up and walked directly to the lounge.
 He was prepared to refine the mysterious energy here.
 His teacher wasn't home, or it would be safer to go there. But it wasn't too bad here either. Liu Long and Wang Ming didn't seem to be very strong in the remains, but in fact, sunlit was still Silver moon's peak combat power.
 Furthermore, a large number of powerhouses had died this time, and silver moon's superpower had even created some hollow zones.
 If it were not for the fact that many powerhouses had come from the central region and the powerhouses from the surrounding provinces had also rushed over after hearing the news, sunlight would have been able to do whatever it wanted now.
 ……
 In the lounge.
 It was very quiet.
 The sound insulation was pretty good.
 After some consideration, Li Hao decided to absorb the earth energy and metal energy first. He absorbed the least of these two types of energy.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The mysterious energy dispersed, and Li Hao began to absorb it.
 The sword could be purified, and the sword energy in the small sword was still enough.
 Time slowly passed.
 Li Hao absorbed the earth energy, and his spleen started to get stronger.
 The pure Earth elemental energy continued to strengthen his spleen, and even the earth sword inside was strengthened. The chain became stronger and locked the earth sword tightly!
 The more this was the case, the harder it was to break out of the spirit realm!
  And this was also a reflection of their Foundation.  This time, Li Hao had made up his mind. He would strengthen his five internal organs to 1000 cubic meters. If it was not enough, he would use divine power stones to absorb and replenish them. He would only go out when his five internal organs were balanced.
 Three days. He had promised hou Xiaochen ... So he had to go.
 After all, that person was too terrifying.
 Of course, there was another reason-the red shadow of the rising light realm!
 Hou Xiaochen said that he would eat it, but he didn 'T. He said that he wasn't strong enough and might not be able to eat it ... Li Hao was still very tempted. The red shadow of the rising light realm must be very nutritious!
 In fact, he wanted to bring it back to the Silver City to eat.
 The last few times he had seen the gossip, it was because he had eaten the red shadow. His bloodline had been stimulated. The red shadow might have the effect of stimulating the bloodline, but it required a very powerful red shadow.
 The first time he saw it, it was a red shadow that had devoured someone at the peak of the radiant sun Stage ... At that time, Li Hao was still weak.
 The second time he saw it, it was the blood God who had eaten the glorious sun and activated his bloodline again.
 The second time, however, was a great harvest for Li Hao.
 He saw that sword!
 Now that he had comprehended sword force, Li Hao felt that if he went to see it again and saw that sword move, he might gain something different or even more insight. He might even be able to comprehend other sword forces.
 While thinking about these things, Li Hao didn't delay his absorption and transformation of the mysterious energy.
 Not only was he strengthening his internal organs, but he was also diligently learning the nine-fold force. Even now, he could only reach the sixth fold. Although it was fast, it was still far from Liu Long's ninth fold.
 Li Hao wasn't going to give up on the five birds technique, the nine-refined force, and the Shadowless Sword.
 However, at this stage, there were too many things he needed to do and there were many directions he could improve in. For a moment, he did not have as much time to slowly study it.
 In the resting room, he was absorbing energy after energy.
 As for the entire basement, because of his cultivation, the mysterious energy had also overflowed. The entire basement was filled with mysterious energy. At this time, the others did not chat anymore. They seized the time and began to cultivate one by one.
 The mysterious energy was spreading. If he didn't hurry up and absorb it, it would soon dissipate in the air.
 Liu Long and Wang Ming had both gained something. Seeing that Li Hao was so eager, they didn't waste any more time and began to cultivate in seclusion to digest what they had gained from the remains.
 ……
  At the same time.
 White moon City.
 As the night passed, hou Xiaochen's story had spread far and wide.
 South City, night patrolmen headquarters.
 The night patrolmen who came in and out today were a little nervous, but there was also some pride and nervousness. Obviously, the previous incident had also spread among the night patrolmen.
 It was simply unbelievable that their boss had killed a legendary top-notch expert with a single spear strike.
 However, it was also because of this that the night patrolmen admired this person even more.
 Of course, this also meant danger.
 After all, hou Xiaochen had killed one of Hong Yue's elders. Now that Zi Yue had escaped, would Hong Yue send someone else?
 If they came, what kind of strength would they have?

 Among the seven moons, Zi Yue was the weakest, but the other six weren't weak. Ying Hongyue was even more terrifyingly powerful.
 Under such circumstances, it was inevitable that everyone would be a little nervous.
 The headquarters building was not very tall.
 Hao lianchuan was calculating the gains and losses of the remains, as well as the spoils of war, the number of people who had been sacrificed, and the battle achievements. He was calculating and distributing them.
 He was still writing when the door was pushed open.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There were only a few night patrols who dared to push open the door and enter. Hou Xiaochen said that he had gone to recuperate and was in seclusion. Clearly, the only person who had come was Chief Steward Yu.
 Hao lianchuan didn't need to look to know. He looked up and said with a headache,""Something else?"
 When Yu dami came here, nothing good would happen.
 If there was something good, he would go straight to hou Xiaochen.
 A faint smile appeared on Chief Steward Yu's face, but it quickly disappeared. He said,""There's something, the people from the administration Bureau are here, they hope to talk, a four-way meeting! Our department heads, the inspection Division, the garrison, the administration Bureau ... Are recuperating, so you're the only one who can talk to them. "
  “……”
 Hao lianchuan was speechless.
 What's the use of me going!
 Do you think I can make the decision?
 "Also, there have been a lot of people coming in recently. Silver Moon is in a state of unrest again. Although there aren't many large-scale attacks, some superpowers and martial masters are frequently involved, causing some losses ... There are some strong people that I need you to deal with."
 "In addition, a group of martial masters have gathered in white moon City, hoping to meet Yuan Shuo. If they can't meet Yuan Shuo, they'll meet Li Hao!"
 "Some organizations, aristocratic families, and even the nine divisions of the central continent have sent people here to meet Li Hao. They want to talk about the blood God and the secrets of the soul."
 Hao lianchuan's head was about to explode!
 "Is there any more?"
 "There are!"
 Chief Steward Yu once again revealed a smile, which quickly disappeared.""As for the garrison, the Tiger wing Army wants to transfer Li Hao over ..."
 "Nonsense!"
 He couldn't make other decisions, but he could make this one. He directly refused,""Let Hu dingfang take a bath and sleep!"
 "Hu dingfang, does he also want to ask about the spirit accumulation?" he asked with a smile.
 "He didn't say that, so it's hard to say."
 Chief Steward Yu said calmly,"besides, do you think Li Hao knows?" Also, Chen Yuhua went to the crosscut Canyon before ... He might know about the secrets of the hidden spirit, so it's probably not for this. "
 Chen Yuhua went to the transverse Canyon?
 Hao lianchuan thought about it and didn't say anything else. Yuan Shuo might have really met this disciple. Of course, he didn't care. He couldn't be bothered to care if Yuan Shuo met him or not.
 He refused directly and did not mention this matter again. He said with a headache,""There are so many things. The Marquis did not even give a specific article, so it is not easy for me to deal with this."
  "When hou bu was in seclusion, he said ... Do as you please!"  At will?
 What did that mean?
 "It doesn't matter whether you agree or not. It's a good thing. The Minister will admit it!" If it's a bad thing, you'll be the scapegoat. At most, you'll be dismissed from your position, and I'll kill you, Third Sun. So ... Do as you please!"
 艹!
 Hao lianchuan really wanted to curse. He understood.
 Old hou actually had such thoughts. He was really F * cking ... Shameless.
 In any case, he would be the one to agree to it, so what did it have to do with hou Xiaochen?
 His face darkened and he didn't say much. He thought for a while and said,""Right, I forgot to tell you. Li Hao said that we agreed to his conditions, so we have to quickly satisfy him! 5000 cubic meters of mysterious energy. "
 "Oh, the Minister mentioned this before. The mysterious energy is gone. He's been compressing the blood God for the past few days to pay off the debt. A Blood God of the rising light realm is not a matter of a mere 5000 cubic meters of mysterious energy ... Now, countless powerhouses are buying blood gods, so Li Hao should have no objections. "
 Alright!
 Hao lianchuan could only say that old hou was indeed very astute. He had probably planned to give this to Li Hao in the first place, but now that he was using it to pay off his debt ... Li Hao had nothing to say.
 As for Li Hao's choice ...
 He put himself in Li Hao's shoes. There was a high chance that he would still choose the blood God of the rising light realm. This thing was really not cheap. Of course, it was also impossible to buy.
 There weren't many blood gods in the entire Crimson Moon.
 The mysterious energy was actually easy to obtain. The Scion of the blood God was really a once in a lifetime opportunity, and there might not be a next time.
 After Hao lianchuan finished talking about this, he said,""Didn't anyone from the headquarters come?"
 Chief Steward Yu revealed a mocking expression, but it quickly disappeared.""Don't you know whether he's here or not? However, he might not appear today. Tomorrow, at the latest, he will probably come. You can just receive him!"
 Me again?
  Hao lianchuan really wanted to cry. He didn't want to answer this stupid question.
 Chief Steward Yu was almost done with what he wanted to say. Just as he was about to leave, he thought of something and turned around."The Head of Department said that he'll give them a carrot after a slap. The three major organizations, including the other major organizations, the nine divisions, and even the royal family ... Can all participate in the remains exploration!"
 "However, the number of people is limited. We can't just let everyone in. One divine energy stone for each person who goes in will do ... You just have to spread the news!"
 Holy sh * t, how dark!
 Hao lianchuan thought to himself,"is the Minister planning to do business with the remains?"
 If each of them were to receive one pill, then if two hundred of them were to go ... Wouldn't that mean that they would receive two hundred pills?
 The ruins were not safe.
 What about the gold-tier Warriors? if they were like the silver-tier Warriors, and their memories were restored at the critical moment ... The rising light?
 That might not be the case!
 Of course, many people had seen the revival of the silver Warriors. The three major organizations should know about it, but the others didn 't. If they weren't prepared, they might suffer heavy losses.
