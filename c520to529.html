huan was speechless, but he still answered honestly,""Dingchen and Kong Qi both died in the inner city. You might know the general situation. There was a gold-tier warrior in the inner city who killed Ding Chen with one punch and shattered his origin divine weapon ... Then, when we were running away together, Kong Qi was a little stupid and insisted on running in the air ... In the end, he was shot dead by the inner city's defense system!"
 After saying that, he immediately looked at the cloaked man and said,""Banshan, don't say that I'm creating rumors. Ask Ziyue and the others yourself. Red Moon and Yama are not on the same side as me. Everyone saw this ... Don't accuse me of setting them up ..."
 The cloaked man looked at Zi Yue and the others.
 Zi Yue frowned slightly and said,"he's telling the truth!" Not only dingchen, but I was also injured. The origin god weapon couldn't stop those monsters at all!"
 "What about the others?"
 "All dead?" Banshan coldly asked.
 It was understandable that two three suns died because of bad luck.
 But what about the remaining sunlight?
 "Without the protection of the three suns ... Don't look at me. We won't help you protect them. The inner city is extremely dangerous. After the three suns died, those people were all wiped out by the gold-tier Warriors. No one will help you protect the people in the fairy realm ... So, don't say that you're not going to help them ... There's no reason to save them!"
 These words were cold-blooded, but they were reasonable.
  "We did see them being killed ... But who would save people they don't know? they're not from the same organization.
 Under the cloak, Banshan was silent.
 Two three suns led the team, many sunlit soldiers, and the origin god weapon ... In the end, they were all annihilated!
 No, there were six.
 But ... All the core forces were dead!
 At this moment, the expression of the leader of the Silver Moon's fairy clan under the cloak was not good.
 Heavy losses!
 "So ... You entered the inner city ... And didn't obtain any treasures?"
 Banshan asked again.
 Not far away, the reincarnation King said indifferently,"yes, there are many origin God weapons. They are very strong!" It was at least a heaven-grade origin god weapon! There are divine energy stones everywhere. We just picked them up casually and found quite a few!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As soon as these words were spoken, some people in the surroundings became restless.
 At this moment, there were people on the cliff, but they couldn't get close.
 Zi Yue also laughed mockingly."That's not all. There's also the puppet above the rising light realm. If we bring it back, we can guarantee that we can kill those at the rising light realm!"
 "Let's see if you ... Have the life to take it! We're not strong enough, so we're barely able to protect ourselves!"
 At this moment, the few of them echoed one another.
 Not to help anyone, but to help himself.
 Absolve him of responsibility!
 It's not that we're weak, it's not that we're incompetent, it's just that it's too dangerous inside.
 They had suffered heavy losses this time, and they knew that the problem was serious. If they were held accountable, they would be in big trouble. Since that was the case, they could just push the blame to others, not the night patrol. If they couldn't even win against Hao lianchuan and the others, it would be a sign of their incompetence.
 This was the fault of the ruins.  Moreover, the inner city of the ruins was indeed dangerous. That gold-tier warrior was an existence that no one could match. This was also a fact.
 At this moment, the surroundings fell silent.
 Everyone understood what he meant.
 He couldn't take out the item because there was a powerful puppet inside. It was extremely terrifying to have killed Ding Chen, who had an origin god weapon.
 Red hair, King Pingdeng, and Banshan all frowned.
 So strong?
 Of course, as sunguang-ranked beings, they weren't afraid. Although it sounded very powerful, it was just a puppet. It wasn't as incredible as it sounded.
 On the other hand, heaven-grade origin divine weapons ... Divine power stones ... These things made their blood boil.
 Is that true?
 The red-haired man looked at Zi Yue. Zi Yue nodded slightly and said,""I'm not lying. There's at least one heaven-grade original God weapon inside ... Moreover, we didn't explore too many places and only explored one area. There are indeed divine energy stones everywhere. We obtained 40, about the same for the Yama, and more night patrols, about 50 ..."
 Their people had also obtained some.
 All in all, the three parties had obtained more than 100 divine power stones.
 The red team was slightly moved by his words.
 There were so many of them just by picking them up?
 Is that true?
 This relic was a little scary, but it was also extremely important.
 Just as they were conversing in secret, someone in the distance shouted,""We don't care about the remains. Whether it's the three major organizations or the night patrollers, these are not what we care about! I just want to know if Yuan Shuo's disciple, Li Hao, made it out alive. "
 That sound was extremely high-pitched!
 In the crowd, Li Hao saw that he was mentioned and glanced at Hao lianchuan. Seeing that they didn't say anything, he said,""I am Li Hao!"
  At this moment, a rough man ran over quickly from the cliff. He didn't fall down, but stood on the cliff and shouted,""You're Li Hao? Li Hao, let me ask you, did your master really reach the warrior energy level?"
 Li Hao nodded."Probably. I don't know the details."
 "Nonsense, how could you not know?"
 "In other words, he has really stepped into the so-called spirit accumulation realm, right?" the man roared.
 "I really don't know, but my master killed sun Yifei, and he said it was the accumulation of spirit ..." Li Hao said again.
 "That's it!"
 The man laughed. Seeing that Li Hao didn't seem to know him well, he said,""You, come with me!"
 Li Hao was dumbfounded.
 Where did this man come from?
 He didn't see any light balls, so he was obviously a Martial Master. However, there were usually only over 100 martial masters, and it was rare to see a warrior Qian. Even if this person was a warrior Qian ... How arrogant was he to shout for him to go with him in front of these three suns?

 "What are you looking at?" the man laughed. It doesn't matter if you don't know me, as long as I know you! If you stay here, the others might kill you. If you follow me and bring me to your master, I'll let you go. It's safer than following them!"
 Li Hao was still confused.
 The man was a little angry, but seeing that Li Hao didn't move, he thought of something and laughed."I forgot to introduce myself. I was quite famous in Silver Moon back then, and I'm he Yong of the southern Fist! For many years, I was not able to become a super but I was lucky enough to become a douqian master in the central continent. A douqian master is not worth mentioning!"
 Li Hao was dumbfounded. Martial Master douqian ... Was indeed very powerful, but ... But there were a group of three suns and sunguang here. You ... Are so arrogant!
 He Yong of the southern Fist!
 Li Hao had heard his teacher mention that Silver Moon had the north and south fists. So, this was the champion of South fist?
 "Hahahaha!" He Yong laughed again."Don't be afraid. I don't have a deep hatred for your master ... Let's put it this way. Those who weren't killed by him back then didn't have a deep hatred! I'm just a Qian warrior, and I'm nothing. I forgot to introduce you again. He Yong lost the face of the Silver Moon Martial Master, and he couldn't make it anymore. A few years ago, he went to the star royal family and became a Lackey, helping the royal family teach the princes and princesses martial arts. He could barely be considered a military officer!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was startled. The royal family?
 The star royal family did not have a strong presence.
  However, it had to be said that even if they did not have a strong sense of existence, this era was still the era of the star dynasty. Although the imperial family had retreated behind the scenes, they still had the strength, including the nine divisions, which were still under the jurisdiction of the imperial family.
 Back then, the Silver Moon Martial Master hated the Imperial court's lackeys the most ... And now ... It was as He Yong had said, he had embarrassed the Silver Moon Martial Master!
 However, his status was not low.
 The imperial family's instructor ... Speaking of which, it wasn't impossible to address him as the emperor's teacher.
 "Hahaha ..." He Yong laughed."But this time, I don't represent the imperial family, and I can't represent ... I just want to find old demon Yuan and tell him that I'm a Martial Master. Let me see what it's like to have a deep spirit! Of course, you'll have to follow me...If these fellows dare to stop me, I'll stop them. If they kill me, they'll be provoking the imperial family. Although the imperial family isn't that great right now, a lean camel is still bigger than a horse. Who would dare to rashly make an enemy of the imperial family?"
 He laughed arrogantly.
 However, in his savagery, there was a little ... Helplessness and sadness.
 He didn't say that he would kill whoever stopped him. He just said that whoever stopped him would be killed, and whoever killed him would be unlucky.
 If this wasn't sorrowful, then what was?
 The king of the Silver Moon Southern Fist could only rely on such a threat to make some people fear him ...
 At this moment, Hong Yitang couldn't help but smile reluctantly,""Brother he, I thought ... You'd say you'd kill whoever stops you with one punch!"
 "Yo, earth overturning sword is still alive!"  He Yong laughed,"I can't take it anymore, I'm old!" In the era of superpowers, martial masters ... Were no longer capable! "However, Yuan Shuo seems to be able to do it. This old thing is really capable. So, I want to see how strong the spiritual accumulation is. Could he kill those above three yang? Can he fight with Ying Hongyue?"
 He was wild and unruly, with an unkempt beard, and laughed extremely loudly. "I've been on the road for three days, rushing here without stopping ... It's such a F * cking pity that I didn't get to see the battle between him and the eyebrow-raising stick!"
 "Did you see that?"
 Hong Yitang said loudly,"I saw it. It was extremely exciting! The five birds technique fought against the eyebrows-balancing staff, and the eyebrows-balancing staff King won by one move, but lost his life ..."
 "Really?" He Yong continued to laugh wildly. The eyebrow raising staff won? I don't believe it! Old demon Yuan wouldn't have gone easy on him, right? Hahaha ... Sun Yifei didn't die in vain. If I could see a God-level Martial Master, I would think it was worth it!"
 Then, he looked at Li Hao again and said,"kid, are you coming with me?" Silvermoon is no longer the Silvermoon of the past. Who would dare to come to Silvermoon and cause trouble?"
 He laughed wildly,"whoever comes will die!" If you don't want to die, then be my grandson and fight your way up until you've defeated everyone here. Only then will you have the right to establish yourself in Silver Moon!"
 "If you don't kill a few famous martial masters, would you dare to set up a post in Silver Moon? What a joke!"
 He laughed arrogantly, as if he was still in his Prime and that this was his home ground.
 However, vaguely ... The martial masters only felt desolation.
 Fist King of South ... Could only recall the past.
  "Are you leaving or not?"
 He Yong roared again,"you brat, why don't you have the spirit of a Martial Master?" They said that you killed the first disciple of the eyebrows-abrest stick. I thought you were someone like old demon Yuan, but how did you become someone like Hong Yitang, who can't do anything even after three strikes?"
 Hong Yitang smiled bitterly and didn't say anything.
 Li Hao also took a deep breath and said,""Senior, I'm a Night Watcher, a Silver Moon night Watcher. Here ... Minister hou and Minister Hao are both here. I have a job to do, so I can't just leave."
 "Your mother's fart!"
 He Yong was furious,"you're counting on these guys?" Hou Xiaochen has always been a Smiling Tiger. He only knows how to smile, but in reality, all he can do is wait for the central continent's rescue. If he dared to resist, he would've resisted a long time ago. How could he allow others to act so atrociously here?"
 "This guy only has a trick up his sleeve when he killed the Silvermoon Martial Master," he roared.
 "Senior He Yong, you can't just say that," hou Xiaochen frowned.
 He Yong sneered,"nonsense?" I'm in the royal family, so how can I not know your background? Back then, you were one of the three commanders of the star dynasty's star guards Army. Don't say you're not!"

 Many people's expressions changed slightly.
 The new members were not clear about it, but the old members all remembered the chaos in the martial arts world during that period.
 This was especially so for the star guards, who had secretly killed many martial masters. Each and every one of them was ruthless and merciless. Some of the martial masters felt their legs go weak when they heard about the star guards.
 Even though the Silver Moon martial arts world was powerful, they had been tortured to death by the star Wei Wu Army.
 Among them, the most terrifying ones were the legendary three great commanders.
 "How's that possible? how old was I twenty years ago?"hou Xiaochen replied helplessly. I'm only in my early forties now. Twenty years ago, I was only in my teens. Could I have become the commander of the Heavenly Star guards? Senior He Yong ... You ... Are you a little confused?"
 When these words were said, some people felt a little strange.
 That's true!
 The Heavenly Star guards Army had been established for more than 30 years. Even the three great commanders in the later stages had been established 20 years ago. They were only disbanded after the night patrol was established.
 It was rumored that the three great commanders back then were all Dou Qian martial masters!
  A Martial Master in his teens?
 That was impossible!
 An old demon like Yuan Shuo was almost fifty years old back then, but he still did not become a warrior.
 He Yong was at a loss for words, but he still said firmly,""Don't deny it. I don't know why you're so strong. You must be one of the three great commanders. Even if you're not ... You must be the last disciple of one of them!"
 Hou Xiaochen didn't know whether to laugh or cry,"I'm really wronged ... Forget it, if you say so! Also, the Heavenly Star guards Army wasn't that notorious. They had only killed a portion of the scum who had wreaked havoc in the world and the martial arts world! Look, aren't you all still alive and well? Even a demon like Yuan Shuo only kills martial masters who are sparring, and no one has done anything to him ... Now that you've mentioned it, why do I feel like the star Army's reputation is really bad ..."
 Everyone was even more surprised when they heard this.
 Don't tell me ... You really are?
 "Don't look at me like that,"hou Xiaochen sighed." The star guards are just a replica of the night patrollers. " If you say that the Wei Wu Army is bad, then you're saying that the night patrollers are bad. "
 It was the same concept!
 ? However, one was an official Martial Master organization, while the other was an official superpower organization.
 In fact, it was the same. He represented the night patrolman, so it would be a problem if he didn't explain himself.
 He then added,"senior he, you should stop causing trouble. If I really kill you, the royal family has been keeping a low profile for so many years. Do you think they will start a war with the three major organizations just for you, a warrior master?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "That's hard to say!"He Yong sneered. "The royal family has nothing now ... We'll just leave some face. If we lose more face, then we'll really have nothing left. The three major organizations are powerful, but the royal family is not without strength!"
  "Alright, alright, you're right!"  Hou Xiaochen laughed, but didn't say anything. He then turned to the other experts, "We've made a fool of ourselves by quarreling. Li Hao's matter is actually a small matter. The key is the remains ..."
 "Li Hao, this is no small matter!" Zi Yue sneered.
 "How could that be ..." Hou Xiaochen replied helplessly,"if you can't do it, just go find Yuan Shuo. As for the eight great families ... Don't make a fuss about it. It's been countless F * cking years, and we don't even know their roots. Don't use that as an excuse!"
 "Everyone, isn't a heaven-grade original God weapon more important than Li Hao?" he asked earnestly. As for Yuan Shuo ... He would find him himself! "If you really can't do it, you can just open a ring and say that Yuan Shuo's martial arts are trash. He might come to find you. Do I make sense?"
 As soon as these words came out, some people were slightly stunned.
 Don't say ... Cough, cough, it might really attract Yuan Shuo.
 Of course, the premise was that he would come openly and not secretly to take your head!
 He then looked at King Pingdeng and Banshan."I can understand that Hongyue is staring at Li Hao. Please don't be like this. You don't know anything, so it's not appropriate for you to stare at him like this, right?"
 King Pingdeng was a dignified-looking middle-aged man. At this moment, he calmly said,""Minister hou, you don't have to worry about us. If Hongyue retreats, we will naturally retreat as well!"
 "That's good!"
 Hou Xiaochen nodded, then looked at Banshan.
 "I don't have any ideas," Banshan said coldly, wearing a cloak."If Minister hou has a fire, don't direct it at me!"
  The two sunrises were very restrained.
 The red-haired man, on the other hand, was frowning.
 As expected, hou Xiaochen also looked at him."Red hair, don't be meddlesome. We'll explore the remains together, and we'll split the origin divine weapons. Li Hao's matter isn't worth making such a big fuss over, right?"
 "You're right ..." The red-haired man frowned and said coldly,"if that's the case, why go against Hong Yue again and again for Li Hao?"
 He then added,"Silver moon's situation is not as good as we thought!" Hou Xiaochen, do you really want to ruin this great opportunity?"
 "It doesn't make sense!" Hou Xiaochen laughed bitterly.
 He then shouted,"Nightwalker headquarters, is anyone here?" They've already been here for a few days, and you're still not here? What the hell! I'm a Third Sun, and an injured one at that ... If you guys still don't come, would we still have any face to speak of as night patrollers?"
 He shouted a few words, but no one replied.
 "What's the point?"hou Xiaochen was even more depressed.
 The red-haired man was calm."You know, some people want you to turn against us, but we don't want to do that. All these years, you killed the second generation Purple Moon, but we didn't cause you any trouble ... Now, you're going against us again and again. No matter how generous I am, I can't tolerate it forever!"

 He was actually quite restrained.
 He talked about reason and the situation.
 Of course, taking Li Hao away was also a mission that had to be completed.
 He didn't want to fall out with hou Xiaochen.
 There were some people who wanted him to fight hou Xiaochen and see how he was doing.
 But ... Why?
 Hou Xiaochen sighed and glanced at Li Hao, who was beside him. He said softly,"Little guy, I've said it before. If you're not worth much, I might not be able to protect you. You see, Xuguang wants to take you away no matter what, and no one above is willing to protect you. Your teacher has also run away, so don't count on Hu dingfang ... The three suns are not reliable, and Xuguang can easily kill him."
 "As for me ... I'm actually in a difficult position ... Young man, what do you think I should do?" he sighed.
 Li Hao thought for a moment and reached out to touch his hand.
 Hou Xiaochen laughed as he extended his hand.
  He clasped his hands together.
 At that moment, an extremely sharp sword Qi circulated within hou Xiaochen's body. In the next moment, an extremely heavy sword intent exploded within his body.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao just looked at him, not moving.
 Hou Xiaochen also looked at Li Hao with a smile.
 Their hands gradually separated.
 Hou Xiaochen laughed and patted Li Hao's shoulder."You ... Even if you want to get close to me ... It's difficult for me to stand up for you!"
 "But ... I'm your Minister!" He laughed. Wouldn't it be too embarrassing to let someone take you away? In the future, no one will listen to me, right?"
 Li Hao nodded."Minister, I'll listen to you in the future!"
 "What a well-behaved child!"
 Hou Xiaochen laughed as he looked at the red-haired man."Red hair, Li Hao said that he would listen to me from now on. He'll be good. Don't look for trouble anymore. I'll count to three and you can leave. I'll take you to explore the ruins later. There will be treasures to take."
 The red-haired man's expression turned ugly!
 This ... What kind of tone was this?
 To coax a child?
 At this moment, the figures of many people could be vaguely seen in the surroundings.
 The king of equality pulled the king of Samsara and disappeared.
 Half of the mountain also disappeared in an instant.
 Redhead frowned, and zirai's expression changed.
 "Hou Xiaochen, are you sure you want to protect him?"
 "One!"
 Hou Xiaochen chuckled as he raised a finger.
 "Hou Xiaochen ..."
 "Three!"
 At this moment, he suddenly skipped two.
 At that moment, hou Xiaochen disappeared.
 At the same time, Hao lianchuan's fiery phoenix spear disappeared.
 ……
 In the air.
 The red-haired man wanted to say something, but before he could finish, his expression changed.
 The next moment, a fire Phoenix appeared in his mind!
 That Fire Phoenix ... Had an extremely cold look in its eyes.
 He knew that he was in trouble!
 At this moment, the red-haired man roared, and an extremely powerful fire energy, which was like the sun and far stronger than Qiao Feilong and the others, and even more powerful than sun Yifei at his peak, instantly exploded!  With a single punch, the heavens collapsed and the earth cracked!
 The red-haired man roared madly!
 At that moment, some people in the surroundings saw it.
 He saw a man in the air, a spear!
 It appeared instantly!
 A fiery-red spear, without the slightest aura, pierced into the red-haired man's chest in an instant, just like this, cold and yet extremely hot!
 In an instant, the long spear pierced through the red-haired man!
 In an instant, the red-haired man threw a punch!
 However, his fist was too late.
 In the next moment, he coughed.
 Hou Xiaochen coughed as he pulled out his spear and swept it through the air. With a bang, the red-haired man's eye-catching red-haired head ... Disappeared.
 A white handkerchief appeared in hou Xiaochen's hand. He coughed and wiped his mouth, causing blood to flow out and dye the handkerchief red.
 He revealed a gentle smile and swept his spear across. With a boom, the lightning in the air instantly dissipated.
 The purple Moon instantly transformed into a bolt of lightning and fled into the distance!
 "What are you doing?" hou Xiaochen chuckled. I didn't say I'll kill you. You're so obedient, I can't bear to kill you. I'm afraid that Ying Hongyue will find trouble with me ... Redhead is only a member of the elder Council, and it's fine to kill him ... Really!"
 After he finished speaking, he laughed and looked down. When he saw Li Hao, he said with a smile,"Look, uncle hou is still very powerful. It's just that he's injured and usually can't fight. If he does, he'll cough up blood!"
 “……”
 The silence was suffocating.
 At this moment, other than the escaping lightning, not a single sound could be heard.
 On the cliff, He Yong quietly retreated and ran away.
 The shadow of the mountain was partly visible and partly hidden, but it disappeared in an instant.
 The king of equality pulled the king of Samsara, and in the blink of an eye, they turned into a breeze and disappeared without a trace.
 The experts on the cliffs disappeared one by one.
 Run!
 Not a single person dared to stay.
 That spear ...
 No one dared to imagine this moment.
 No one dared to believe it!
 Hou Xiaochen ... The hou Xiaochen who had been suffering from injuries for so many years, this was the first time he had fought face to face ... And killed a sunrise realm cultivator with a single spear strike!
 At that moment, hou Xiaochen ... Was so terrifying that it was suffocating.
 On the cliff, the experts hiding in the dark had ugly expressions.
  Some of them were even wearing black uniforms.
 The uniform of the night patrolman!
 At this moment, these few people retreated silently, their faces only filled with solemnity and fear.
 Hou Xiaochen!
 He ... Actually made a move!
 ……
 Below.
 Li Hao's mouth was wide open, Wang Ming's mouth was wide open, and so was everyone else 's.
 In the air, hou Xiaochen casually threw the fire Phoenix spear to Hao lianchuan and walked down step by step. He coughed continuously, and the blood on his handkerchief became more and more intense.
 With a gentle smile, he walked to Li Hao and said,""Isn't uncle hou very handsome?"

 “……”
 Li Hao swallowed his saliva. After a long while, he said nervously,""Cool!"
 "This is right!"
 Hou Xiaochen laughed. He looked around and said,"Alright, look, aren't these people all gone? They've been so noisy for days. If I hadn't been waiting for Hao lianchuan to come out with the fire Phoenix spear, I would have killed them with one shot. They're so annoying!"
 After saying this, he looked at Hao lianchuan and said resentfully,""The fire Phoenix spear was with you, and you didn't kill a single person ... If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have let you take it away!"
 Hao lianchuan opened his mouth, but he was speechless.
 If I f * cking knew that you could kill Xu Guang with one shot ... I ... I ...
 He didn't even know what to say!
 It was at this moment that everyone finally understood why the three great organizations did not dare to provoke this man even though many of their members had been killed in Silver Moon.
 He was too strong!
  It was ridiculously powerful!
 Most importantly ... Putting aside how powerful he was, when he attacked, he wasn't careless at all. On the count of three, he killed a rising light realm cultivator with the second strike!
 "Let's go, let's go. This place can only be reopened next month ... Let's go back. Old Yan, pack up. Even Xuguang's bones are valuable ... Take it back and don't waste it!"
 Then, he patted Li Hao's shoulder and said with a bright smile,""Not bad, li! Although I can't compare to your teacher, it's worth me helping you once. Back then, I helped your teacher once and he promised to explore 30 ruins for me. Little li, what do you think you should do?"
 “……”
 Li Hao didn't say anything for a long time. Then, he said with a stiff smile,""I ... I'm a Night Watcher in life and a ghost in death!"
 “……”
 This time, hou Xiaochen was stuck. After a while, he said,"This ... This is too serious. Be more specific!"
 "Hit wherever you point!" Li Hao said seriously.
 Hou Xiaochen smiled and nodded,"that's right!" This young man has a bright future, better than your teacher, your teacher ..... He doesn't keep his word, he ran away before even exploring the 30 ruins, don't learn from him!"
 Li Hao smiled stiffly and didn't say anything.
 At this moment, he was being hugged by Minister hou and they affectionately flew into the sky together. Minister hou was so enthusiastic!
 At this moment, some people who were hiding in all directions were watching from afar.
 Hou Xiaochen!
 After today, hou Xiaochen's name would definitely resound throughout the entire star dynasty!
 Killing a rising light with a single strike!
 Silver Moon ... It seemed that he was still the same Silver Moon that had struck fear in everyone's hearts!
 p He had been dormant for many years ... No, perhaps he wasn't dormant at all. This person might have just felt that no one was worth his time.  He didn't seem to care too much about staying dormant!
 Otherwise, he wouldn't have made a move so easily today and killed Xu Guang with a single spear strike.  At this moment, someone finally understood.
 Why had hou Xiaochen stopped fighting after the last battle? it was just that no one made him feel threatened, and no one dared to threaten him!
 ……
 In an instant, countless pieces of news began to spread in all directions!
 The ruins were just a side effect.
 The key was Silvermoon Marquis Xiaochen.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com How strong was this person?
 Was his injury real or fake?
 Was he one of the three great commanders of the star martial Guards Army?
 The douqian Martial Master from more than twenty years ago!
 At this moment, the entire Silver Moon fell silent. There were no more experts making a ruckus. King Pingdeng and half a mountain had disappeared. The few rising lights who dominated a region did not even let out a fart and just ran away.
 The only thing left was the red hair that could never leave.
 Many Crimson Moon experts had already died in this place.
 ……
 In the car.
 Hou Xiaochen was still coughing, and Li Hao was sitting next to him. Li Hao was motionless, like a zombie.
 "Don't be afraid, I don't eat people!"Hou Xiaochen coughed and laughed. I'll let you eat that red shadow later, and you'll be amazing. Red shadow of the rising sun, it'll be a great supplement after you eat it!"
 He laughed after he finished speaking.
 "I'm afraid you can't digest it ... Forget it, we'll talk about it later. Little guy, after you go back, take a three-day break and report to me, understand?"
  "Understood!"
 "Good girl!"
 Hou Xiaochen patted his head, then ... Threw him off the car,"Go. Go back to the Silver City first. Take a break and relax. No one will dare to find trouble with you at this time. I said it!"
 "Thank you, Minister!"
 Li Hao only heaved a sigh of relief after the car disappeared.
 艹!
 It was so scary!
 It felt like ... It was no worse than the Golden punch!
 No, it might even be stronger.
 The person he killed was three suns, but he killed Xu Guang!

 In the wilderness outside the transverse Canyon.
 Li Hao just stood there silently, not moving.
 As he watched the car slowly drive away, Li Hao's mind wandered.
 After an unknown period of time, someone arrived. Liu Long's speed was extremely fast, and he madly rushed over.
 And Wang Ming also ran over, skipping.
 The two of them landed next to Li Hao. At this moment, Wang Ming was still in a daze, while Liu Long was clear-headed, but he still couldn't hide the shock in his eyes.
 "Li Hao!"
 Liu Long shouted, and Li Hao came back to his senses. Seeing Liu Long, he nodded,""Boss!"
 "Are you alright?"
 p "What can happen to me?"   Li Hao laughed. Then, he looked at Liu Long and suddenly said,""Boss, do you think ... He's really injured or is he faking it?"
 "I don't know,"
 Liu Long shook his head. At this moment, he could not hide his shock and exclaimed, "He's too strong! He's so strong that I think ... He's not even on the same level as us. I never thought that there would be such a person in Silver Moon!"
 Hou Xiaochen's reputation in Silver Moon wasn't small.
 However, in the entire Sky Star dynasty, he was only the leader of the night patrols in a remote province out of the 99 provinces. In Silver Moon, according to his status, he was not even in the top three.
 The administrative Bureau, the garrison headquarters, the inspection Division headquarters ...
 The bosses of these places actually had a higher status than him.
 In the end, a person like this had managed to strike the heaven suppressing star with his spear!
 This was even more shocking than Yuan Shuo killing a late stage three yang!
 It wasn't a battle, but a ... Crushing!
 Yes, crushing.
 It made people suspect that even if the red-haired man was stronger, he would not be able to escape death.
 On the side, Wang Ming was still in a daze, but when he heard the two's conversation, he seemed to come back to his senses and muttered,"Why do you care so much? he ... The Head of the Department is our superior. It's a good thing. The more powerful he is, the better!"
 After saying that, he suddenly looked at the two of them excitedly, as if he had just thought of something. He said excitedly,""Li Hao, we're rich!"
 “……”
 The two of them looked at Wang Ming in a daze. Why was he suddenly talking about getting rich?
 Yes, they had struck it rich in the remains.
 But ... He shouldn't be so excited until now, right?
 Wang Ming was extremely excited."No... I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about ... I'm talking about how hou bu just killed a sunguang!"
 And then?
 The two of them were dumbfounded. He did kill him, but Hao lianchuan had already taken care of Xuguang's body. Did he think that no one wanted him and that he would go and pick him up?
 What was she thinking?
 "The purple Moon ran away, and most of the Crimson Moon's men are dead, but ... Have you forgotten that there are still three Crimson Moon sunlit cultivators alive?!" At this time, the others were all scared to death. If they all ran away, who would care about those sunlit? The night patrolmen are also busy dealing with the aftermath ... No one is in charge!"
 You still don't understand?
  No one cared about the three Crimson moons that came out of the ruins!  Li Hao and Liu Long opened their mouths in shock.
 I'll go!
 It was hard to believe that this fellow was actually thinking about such a thing at this moment.
 Really, Li Hao didn't even think about this.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wang Ming said anxiously,"there's a gold element one over there ... I remember that one of the three is of the gold element!" Fast, that's how fast riyao is. He can't have gone far ... Li Hao, aren't you rich?"
 Alright, I see.
 Because one of them had the metal element, this guy had his eyes on him.
 "Are you leaving or not? hurry up! Otherwise, we won't be able to do anything when the others come to their senses!" He said hurriedly.
 Li Hao looked at Liu Long, and Liu Long also looked at Li Hao.
 After a while, the two of them looked at each other and smiled.
 Although Wang Ming looked a little unsatisfied and blinded by greed, it had to be said that if he didn't deal with those three from the Crimson Moon, they really wouldn't be able to do anything in the future.
 When the others came back to their senses and remembered, coupled with the temptation of the red shadow, they might really take action quickly.
 They had already fought Red Moon to such an extent. One kill meant one less.
 Li Hao didn't say anything more. He quickly jumped and chased in a direction.
 The red moon ... Was too obvious.
 The red shadow was something that could not be avoided.
 Usually, it was a threat to others, but at this moment, it was a fatal thing because the red shadow was very conspicuous. In the wilderness, it might not be too conspicuous if other superpowers ran away, but it was the red moon's people. How could that bloody thing hide from Li Hao's eyes in the middle of the night?
 Even mosquito legs are meat!
 The three red Moon sunlit cultivators were not a big deal, not to mention the mysterious energy. The key was that all three of them had walked out of the ruins and entered the inner city, although they might have handed their divine power stones to the purple Moon.
 But ... What if?
 What if he didn 't?
 What if they also pocketed some?
 Liu Long and the others could think of swallowing some, but would these few sunlit people be so obedient that they would really hand over all the divine energy stones?
  Also, if he were to hand it over, would he hand it over after he left the ruins?
 Everything was possible!
 With the addition of the red shadow ...
 For Li Hao, killing Hong Yue's men was the best way to maximize his benefits.
 He was extremely fast, and Liu Long and Wang Ming quickly followed.
 Three people, two douqian and one Dayao.
 They knew the strength of the three people on the other side. Two of them were at the middle stage of the sun glory realm, and one was at the late stage.
 None of them were weak!
 Wang Ming was so bold not because he thought he was strong, but because he knew how powerful Li Hao was. Li Hao had almost killed him with a single strike, and they had even killed a middle stage three yang cultivator together.
 Now, he was dealing with three late-stage sunlight shining experts who were scared out of their wits. Was it difficult?

 ……
 In the wilderness.
 The three Crimson Moon experts were trembling in fear.
 When he came out, it was actually midnight. However, on the other side of the canyon, there were many powerhouses. Their superpowers lit up the surroundings, making it seem as if it was daytime.
 In fact, it was already late at night.
 The three sunshine powerhouses were shivering as they escaped from the valley. They chose to hide at the first moment, not daring to run away. At this moment, countless powerhouses were running in all directions.
 If they were not careful and encountered an enemy ... That would be troublesome.
 The red-haired elder was dead!
 The leader of the purple Moon had escaped ... The group of people who had come out earlier had probably been arranged to leave. After all, they had brought hei Teng with them. Now, only the three of them were left in the entire Crimson Moon. The moment red-haired died, the three of them were scared out of their wits.
 Fortunately, everyone had been scared out of their wits at the time, and hou Xiaochen hadn't paid any attention to them, so they had been able to escape.
  At this moment, the three of them were hiding in a rock.
 Yes, a rock.
 Among the three of them, an earth elemental Expert used his superpower to dig out the entire rock. The three of them hid inside and sealed the rock, silencing their superpower.
 This was the safest way to hide.
 As for burrowing into the ground ... The pressure underground was actually extremely great. It was useless to hide too shallow, but if you hid too deep, you would have to bear the pressure of the ground.
 The three of them had thought it through. They were going to hide here, but when would they leave?
 Without three to five days ... They would not dare to go out!
 At this moment, the three of them were hiding in the huge rock. They didn't say a word, and their faces were filled with fear and uneasiness.
 The powerful red Moon organization had even sent a Big Shot from the central region, sunguang.
 In the end ... He was stabbed to death by a spear!
 What an unforgettable scene!
 It was even more terrifying and despairing than the gold-tier warrior who had killed dingchen with one punch. Perhaps flying sunbeams at that time were also in the same panic. The three of them didn't have the time to think about what the people in the flying sky were thinking. They were all dead anyway.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The surroundings gradually became quiet.
 A faint breathing sound could be heard as the three of them let out a breath. One of them said in an extremely low and weak voice,""Will lady Zi Yue ... Remember us?"
 It was not a good idea to keep hiding here.
 However, they really didn't dare to leave on their own. At this moment, they could only hope that stronger existences would come from the central continent and kill their way back with Zi Yue and the others. Then, they would be able to leave.
 "I don't know ..."
 "Don't say anything!"
 The third person reminded them in a low voice to stop talking. Although they were hiding in the center of the giant rock and no sound could be heard, it was better to be careful at this moment.
 It was too dangerous!
 The three of them didn't speak anymore.
 ……
 Outside the huge rock.
 Li Hao looked at the three eye-catching balls of light in the center of the rock, and then at the three eye-catching Red Shadows next to them ...
 Li Hao was also speechless!
 It's so conspicuous. Why is he hiding here?
  Of course, he knew that it was because he was special and had seen too much.  Under normal circumstances, no one would intentionally search for a stone among countless stones and then investigate the inside of the stone. No normal person would do such a thing.
 Liu Long glanced at Li Hao.
 Li Hao shook his head slightly.
 He made a hand gesture, indicating for Liu Long to wait.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, began to prepare.
 What was brewing?
 He was preparing to compress the earth sword!
 That's right. The mountain in the spleen had been compressed to the size of a pillar. He had been controlling it all this time, and now, Li Hao wanted to continue compressing it.
 Stone, just right.
 It was also considered earth-type!
 If he condensed his sword force and used it to attack, would it be very powerful?
 He wanted to try.
 The three people inside were the best targets, and they didn't move at all ... So they weren't dangerous. Li Hao could have more time to test his first sword technique.
 He was such a good person!
 In the spleen, the earth sword was compressed and continued to compress. Soon, the shape of a heavy sword was carved out by Li Hao.
 He thought about it for a long time ... And finally carved the shape of a silver greatsword.
 That's right, that silver-tier warrior was a greatsword. It was heavy and had no edge, but it was extremely powerful. The last strike was even more unforgettable for Li Hao.
 Previously, he felt that the sword move was not quite compatible with the sword force he had comprehended before.
 But at this moment, he felt that this sword strike had a very suitable sword momentum!
 In his hand, the earth-covered sword trembled slightly.
 Hong Yitang's Earthcover sword was very powerful. At that time, he said that it was enough for Li Hao to use to accumulate spirit.
 However, at this moment, as Li Hao's sword slowly appeared, the sword seemed to be trembling.
 It was as if this was the true earth overturning sword!
 Gradually, Li Hao's force changed. When the heavy sword was formed, he had a feeling that this sword could be integrated into his sword force and become a real Earth sword force!
 The earth and the sword had become one!
  This feeling was even more obvious than when he had stepped into the thousand warrior tier.
 The moment he stepped into the thousand warrior tier, he felt that he had merged with the force.
 But it seemed very deliberate and unnatural.
 At this moment, they seemed to have fused together extremely naturally.
 Li Hao smiled and raised the overlayed sword. He looked at the huge rock in front of him and recalled the strike of the silver warrior ...
 The next moment, Li Hao's aura changed!
 Pressing forward with indomitable will!
 The determination to face the unknown enemy in the sky ...
 "Slash!"
 Li Hao couldn't control his emotions. He was so excited and impulsive that he couldn't help but shout, even though he knew that it was best to do it silently.

 But ... Am I afraid?
 As he shouted in a low voice, the three sunlit cultivators in the rock heard and felt it, and their faces changed!
 The next moment, the stone cracked.
 The three of them wanted to rush out immediately. They didn't know who had come, but running was their first choice.
 However, as soon as he opened the stone ... He suddenly felt the weight of Mount Tai.
 Earth element?
 Among the three, the earth element expert roared and also released a burst of earth energy.
 The metal-Elemental Expert also instantly condensed countless sharp spikes and shot them at the enemies who couldn't see clearly!
 The last person was a Water-type, and a water dragon charged at Li Hao ...
 The three of them were extremely decisive in their actions.
  Not only that, the three red figures, who had been hiding nearby for fear of being detected, also charged at Li Hao at his command.
 The silent Red shadow was often Hong Yue's winning magic weapon.
 However, they had underestimated Li Hao's strength this time.
 BOOM!
 A huge heavy sword fell. In an instant, the earth Shield created by the earth element expert was shattered. The Golden thorns that flew out exploded one after another. The Water Dragon was cut in half by this sword.
 The big sword was still falling!
 Bang! Bang!
 The earth-Elemental Expert took the lead. The mid-stage sunlight shining realm expert's bones were crushed by the huge sword, and the next moment, the huge sword fell and exploded with a loud bang!
 Even until his death, he was still incomparably shocked.
 What was this?
 Not a superpower?
 A Martial Master!
 This was a Martial Master. At this moment, the first person he dodged was Hong Yitang. Yes, the earth overturning sword!
 The heavens and earth were turned upside down!
 But why did Hong Yitang want to kill him?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He didn't have much time to think about it. His body exploded, and his thoughts came to an end.
 The metal element expert's expression changed drastically.
 Among the three of them, he was the strongest as he had reached the late stage of the sunlit realm. However, no matter how much he burst out, he could not kill the middle stage of the sunlit realm with one sword strike ... Three suns?
 He turned around and wanted to escape!
 However, it was only at this moment that the heavy sword completely descended. With a boom, the sword descended. Boundless gravity pressed down, mixed with incomparably sharp sword Qi. In an instant, the sword Qi sliced this person into a bloody man.
 The heavy sword fell with a loud bang, completely crushing him to death!
 It was slightly better than the earth element, as it didn't explode.
 However, this was only one sword strike!
 With one sword attack, the earth-element mid-stage of the sunlit realm exploded, and the metal-element late-stage of the sunlit realm was crushed to death.
 At this moment, the Water-type sunlit cultivator no longer had any thoughts of fighting. He only had one thought in his mind-escape.
 He took advantage of Li Hao's sword to escape.
 In an instant, he charged in the opposite direction of Li Hao.  Right at this moment, the sound of waves could be heard. In the next moment, a fist appeared. Liu Long, who had been hiding all this time, suddenly rushed out like a cheetah and threw a punch!
 Ninth refinement force!
 A Dayao who was scared out of his wits, a Dayao who only wanted to escape ...
 His opponent had only run a dozen meters when he was hit by the punch. With a loud bang, his water shield was broken. Not only that, the punch directly penetrated his opponent!
 Liu Long's expression was cold. This time, he attacked many times.
 When he was fighting li Dahu, he couldn't kill him with one punch. He was still holding a grudge and remembered it in his heart.
 When he was dealing with Zhang Ting, he had been thinking of ways to break through the defense of the three suns. After killing Zhang Ting, his confidence increased greatly.
 This punch was also a summary of his experience.
 With just one punch, this mid-stage sunlit glory cultivator's chest was pierced through. In the next moment, Liu Long's fists were like phantoms as he continuously punched out more than ten times. He only stopped when the other party was completely blown up.
 In the blink of an eye, the battle was over.
 The three red figures in the air stopped in front of Li Hao's head.
 It was as if he had lost his command.
 It felt like he was delivering himself to the door.
 In the distance, Wang Ming was hurrying over. Li Hao had told him to wait for a while and attack when the battle started, but he had immediately attacked the moment Li Hao made his move ...
 And then ... Nothing!
 The battle was over!
 Liu Long was cleaning up the battlefield, while Li Hao was randomly stabbing the air with a small sword.
 And he ... Continued to be at a loss.
 It ended?
 The three of them died?
 It wasn't riyao who was beaten up, but Yueming, right?
 What was he doing here?
 Wang Ming was muddleheaded, completely dumbfounded. He had been dumbfounded ever since they had left the remains.
 No more?
 It wasn't until Li Hao finished dealing with the red shadow and directly devoured its power that Wang Ming came back to his senses. He looked at Liu Long, but the latter ignored him and continued to work. He said excitedly,"As expected, there are really divine power stones, but not many. These three guys are not very brave. They kept three for themselves, one for each of them, one for earth, one for gold, and one for water. It seems that they only dared to keep one for the corresponding divine power Stone."
 Previously, they had obtained 32.
  In addition to these three, there were a total of 35 crystals!
 "Um ... Commander Liu, next time ... Next time, just leave the cleaning up of the battlefield to me," Wang Ming said dryly.
 I didn't do anything!
 There was no need to clean up the battlefield now.
 I suddenly feel so useless. If this goes on, will I still have a share of meat next time?
 This won't do!
 As for Li Hao, he was currently devouring the power of three red Shadows. This time, he didn't see the eight trigrams. It seemed that the eight trigrams could only be seen in the Silver City.
 He was in a good mood.
 It wasn't because he killed the three red moons or the late stage of the sunlit realm, but because he had a new understanding of earth sword force. After trying it out, Li Hao discovered that his force was much stronger than before.
 As expected, some of Hong Yitang's previous theories were useful.

 This sword had proven everything.
 "Hurry up and settle this. Let's go!"
 Li Hao was in a particularly good mood. He took advantage of the fact that the battle had ended quickly and left.
 Liu Long quickly destroyed the scene of the battle. Seeing this, Wang Ming hurriedly joined in to help clean up.
 Soon, everything was almost cleaned up.
 The three of them didn't say anything and quickly left.
 ……
 Not long after.
 Hao lianchuan arrived with a few sunlit Warriors. He seemed to have felt some fluctuations and quickly rushed over. After looking for a while, he frowned slightly."There was a battle here. I don't know if it was red Moon and the others ... But the scene has been cleaned up. Someone should have died!"
 He sensed it carefully. There seemed to be a sword intent, but it wasn't too obvious.
  "Minister, should we continue the search?"
 Someone asked. Hao lianchuan had just finished dealing with Xuguang's body and remembered that there were still a few sunlit cultivators in the red moon.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't care, but he did.
 Sunlight was still a threat.
 Now that he had completely fallen out with Hong Yue and killed Xu Guang, how could he let her leave?
 However, he did not catch up with them.
 Just now, he had sensed some movement here and had run over as fast as he could, but he was still too late.
 The three suns had made their move?
 He wasn't too sure, but the feeling before was a bit like the three suns had attacked.
 Of course, there was no telling how many powerhouses Silver Moon was hiding at the moment, so he could not determine who had done it. The ones who had died were most likely Crimson moon's men, and at this stage, he probably would only dare to make a move on Crimson Moon.
 "Let's go back!"
 Hao lianchuan had already wasted a lot of time by not following them. Next, white moon City would be the main focus. Hou bu had killed a Xuguang with a single shot. Who knew how much more trouble he would have to deal with next?
 ……
 That night, there was a hint of uneasiness in the calm.
 It felt like a storm was coming.
 As hou Xiaochen entered white moon City, the city quickly entered its best state of alert. The Tiger wing Army was mobilized frequently, and the city's Inspection Office was also dispatched in large numbers to patrol the entire city.
 The administrative Bureau was not as quiet as it used to be, and the night was brightly lit.
 Hou Xiaochen might rebel!
 This was the judgment of some people.
 Of course, he could not be sure.  However, hou Xiaochen had been waiting for the central Division to make a move, but nothing had happened. He had made his move and killed a top-notch expert. If that person led the Silvermoon Nightwalker to rebel, then with the Tiger wing Army and the inspection Office ...
 The entire Silver Moon would instantly enter a state of turbulence.
 Not only that, but the worst thing was that someone took the lead. If hou Xiaochen rebelled now, it would only be a matter of time before chaos erupted!
 It wasn't a big deal for a few experts to riot.
 More importantly, hou Xiaochen represented the night patrol, and he had the cooperation of the inspection Office and the garrison. This wasn't just a matter of one or two experts, but a major change in the entire government system. This kind of change was intolerable.
 Now, although the star dynasty was in chaos, and there were even some big shots who were ambitious and wanted to be independent, so far, in the 99 provinces, even if there were some sporadic riots ... There were no big shots who stood out.
 Hou Xiaochen could be considered one of them.
 ……
 At the administration Bureau.
 At this moment, it wasn't just the people from the director who were present, there were also a few guests with special identities.
 Among them, there were even people wearing the uniform of the inspection Division.
 A man with short hair and sharp eyes looked at the few people in the small meeting room and said in a deep voice,""I never would've thought that hou Xiaochen would have hidden so much! That year, when he fought with Ying Hongyue, it was a draw and he wasn't killed. We knew that this person wasn't simple! After that, the central government tried to recruit him many times and even promoted him to a higher rank. The inspection Division even offered him extraordinary treatment and even promised him the position of Deputy Secretary of the general office, but he refused!"
 In terms of status, the inspection Division was one of the nine divisions, and the secretaries of the nine divisions were the nine tycoons of the dynasty.
 The Deputy Secretary below him was also a Big Shot in the entire dynasty.
 Hou Xiaochen's status was equivalent to three levels!
 But even so, hou Xiaochen still refused.
 As the man spoke, he sneered,"as expected, this fellow has long harbored the intention to rebel!" He's always been unwilling to be conscripted, but he won't hide this time. I think he'll rebel soon ..."
 "Cough cough!"
 In the small meeting room, an old man with slightly white hair coughed lightly."Watch your words!" It's hou Xiaochen's fault that he can't be transferred, and killing Redmoon sunguang is only right ... As long as he doesn't raise the flag, he's still an important member of the dynasty, so you can't say anything. Otherwise, if hou Xiaochen is forced to rebel ... Who ... Who will be responsible?"
  In the meeting room, several people looked at the old man.
 He was also the highest-ranking leader of Silver Moon, the Silver Moon director of the administration Bureau.
 Hou Xiaochen was in cahoots with the military and the inspection Division. Only the administration department had ignored him and even reminded the higher-ups many times to take Silver Moon seriously. As such, these people had come here as soon as they had escaped from the transverse Canyon.
 "Lord Zhao ..."
 That person wanted to say more, but the old man coughed again. Hearing this cough, a few people present were obviously a little uncomfortable.
 Hou Xiaochen loved to cough!
 Silver moon's men were all like this, coughing from time to time.
 It was said that Yuan Shuo would do the same sometimes.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Were they all weak and sickly?
 Although director Zhao was only a scholar before, after the rise of superpowers and becoming the leader of Silver Moon, the higher-ups still gave him a lot of preferential treatment. He had also become a superhuman ... After 20 years, he had barely become a sunlit expert.

 Riyao ... He's a little old, but his body shouldn't be that weak, right?
 The few of them cursed in their hearts and felt helpless.
 The other party's strength wasn't considered strong, but his status was very high. His relationship in stellarsky city was very complicated, and the few of them didn't dare to interrupt him.
 The old man coughed a few times and said slowly,"everyone, please calm down!" Hou Xiaochen won't be able to raise the flag unless he's forced into an unavoidable situation ... Right now, I think we should ... Fight for a bit ... With such a powerful force, staying in the Silver Moon is good for strengthening the Silver Moon Empire. If he's willing to go to the central continent, he'll be able to fight for the Empire ... Forcing him to rebel isn't a good thing!"
 "Lord Zhao, you mean ... We're not going to care about him?"
 The short-haired man frowned."Today, he deliberately shouted loudly to get reinforcements from the central continent ... Since he has such strength, this move is obviously a provocation!"
 “……”
 Lord Zhao laughed and said softly,"don't think too much about it. Maybe he just doesn't want to make a move. I don't think we should make such a conclusion for now. After all, he killed a rising light with a single shot. I don't think you want to see him being forced to rebel, right?"
 After saying that, he added,"I still suggest that everyone meet up and have a talk!" This includes the three commanders of the garrison, the head of the inspection Division, hou Xiaochen, me, and all the representatives from stellarsky city ... Let's sit down and have a chat!"
 "Talk?"
  "Is he willing to talk?" the short-haired man asked in a deep voice. If we reveal ourselves, we might be killed by him!"
 "There's another thing I want to say," he continued after a moment of silence."Previously, there was a Special Agent from the headquarters who was stationed in Silver Moon to be in charge of supervising some cases. In the end, he went missing!"
 "Missing, Special Agent?"
 "Yes, a middle stage three yang night patrolman with an origin god weapon entered the ruins with them and never came out again!"
 Speaking of this, the short-haired man said solemnly,"the person and the origin divine weapon have disappeared. We've also asked around. Through some special channels, they said that after that person entered the city, he disappeared without a trace. I suspect ..."
 The old man coughed again."I've heard about it. It's said that the inner city is very dangerous, and there are even existences that surpass the rising light. Among the three suns that entered this time, only Hu dingfang and Hao lianchuan have a chance to deal with them ... But these two have been acting with the other three suns. If they really do, will the purple Moon and the Samsara cover for them?"
 "You can doubt hou Xiaochen, but don't jump to conclusions!" The old man frowned. And don't randomly frame anyone!"
 "I'm not happy with some of hou Xiaochen's actions, and I'm even more unhappy that he's colluding with the military. I'm also unhappy that he's taking control of the inspector Bureau ..."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "But!"
 The old man's tone became stern,"it doesn't mean that we have to frame him for everything. This is not good!" This time, the Heavenly Star City sent you all here, and all of you are powerful superhumans. Why don't you send a civil official who is still clear-headed?"
 He ignored their ugly expressions and said with a frown,""This is not appropriate! Martial strength was not the only thing! If we're strong enough, we can do anything. What else do we need to do?"
 He was a little angry,"the few of you are impulsive and do not follow the right path!" I understand what you mean. Regardless of the evidence or the death of the special Agent, we just have to frame the night patrolman. Even if we don't rebel, we have to rebel!"
 He smacked the table, looking extremely angry.""Is this how you guys do things? Hou Xiaochen has rebelled. Do you have the confidence to suppress him and make a great contribution, or do you have the confidence to kill him and take his head to stellarsky city to claim credit?"
 The more he listened to their tone, the more he felt that something was wrong, and the more he heard, the more impatient he became.
 The few guys who came this time were actually all such bastards!
 He was very dissatisfied!
 Some of the people present had ugly expressions, while others were silent.
 After all, an old man's status was high.
 Even though they were powerful and the short-haired man was at the level of sunguang ... Yes, he was a top-notch existence at the level of sunguang and was also a god tier master blessed by the heavens. He was extremely powerful, but at this moment, he could only frown and endure.
 ,m "Lord Zhao!"  The short-haired man also frowned."Okay, we can do as you say and talk to him ... But I won't show up. Leave this matter to Lord Zhao to avoid a conflict when we meet ... I will enter the city tomorrow and the day after ... I hope Lord Zhao can keep this a secret."
 "Why?" the old man sighed. Do you think he doesn't know you're here?"
 Entering the city tomorrow and the day after ... Naturally, it was to put on a disguise, which meant that they had not arrived in time.
 However, did he really think that hou Xiaochen was an idiot?
 All these years, the supers had risen. A group of supers, who had no talent, no virtue, and no ability, were in high positions!
 To deal with Silver moon's matter, the border province did not send a reliable member of the dynasty, but a few powerful boorish men ... How could this be successful?
 He seemed to be a little tired and waved his hand.""Alright, I understand! I'll do my best to communicate with hou Xiaochen. Silver Moon won't be in a state of chaos in the short term!"
 The short-haired man didn't say anything and got up. The others also quickly got up and followed him out.
 Their patience had run out with this person.
 It was just sunlight!
 In the end, he showed off his might.
 ……
  After everyone had left, the old man looked at his Deputy and sighed.""It seems that the nine divisions also think that strength is the most important. Talent, wisdom, and methods are all secondary. We are going to be eliminated!"  The Deputy wasn't young anymore, and his hair was a little white. He was wearing glasses that were almost invisible now and was reading some information. He raised his head and smiled."Director, you have to accept the reality of the new era! The central region was in chaos, and great battles continued. Strength was King! The nine divisions are all trying their best to improve their strength. Without strength...How can they suppress those disobedient powerful cultivators?"
 "What do you think I should do?" the old man asked with a sigh.
 "The director has already made his decision, right?"
 "Maybe!"
 The old man sighed again. He was a little tired.
 The people who had come this time had given him a heavy blow. He had originally thought that a few old acquaintances would come. They were all very smart and capable people. With them here, even if hou Xiaochen didn't want to rebel, he wouldn't be able to do anything.
 In the end ... There were a few bastards who were waiting for hou Xiaochen to rebel!
 He was afraid that hou Xiaochen wouldn't rebel. If he didn't rebel ... Where would he get the credit?
 If they didn 't, how were they supposed to tell the higher-ups that hou Xiaochen was wrong and they were right?
 The old man felt even more helpless. He stood up and sighed,""The building is about to collapse, and monsters will emerge! Strength was King, and the people lived in misery! In this day and age, how many people are still willing to think for the people?"
 "I thought hou Xiaochen was a traitor ..."
 "Now ... Looking at it again, hou Xiaochen can be considered a rare good person! Pathetic, laughable, and lamentable!"
 The old man shook his head and slowly left.
 All these years, he'd been trying to suppress the growth of the night watchers and get hou Xiaochen to leave. This person was too dangerous at the border, and his prestige in Silver Moon was too high. This wasn't a good thing.
 But now, it seemed ... A newcomer would most likely be inferior to hou Xiaochen!
 Silver Moon, we can only rely on the Silver Moon people!
 ……
 At the same time.
 The night patrolman.
 Hou Xiaochen looked in the direction of the administration Bureau with a smile on his face. Beside him, Hao lianchuan was giving a detailed report on what had happened in the ruins.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't seem to be very interested. He only looked over for a while before saying,"Old Yan, do you think that Zhao is crying or laughing now?"
 "Ah?"
 Hao lianchuan was stunned. What was she saying?
 Who was he talking about?
 "I'm talking about the one from the administration Bureau. "
 "Oh!"
 Hao lianchuan understood. He smiled."That old man is so stubborn. He's probably worried that the department head will take his head!"
 "Then you're wrong!"
 Hou Xiaochen chuckled,"that old man sure isn't afraid. Besides ... Why would I take his head?" You make me sound like a bad person. Old Yan, you don't have a good impression of me. When have I ever done such a thing all these years?"
 “……”
 Well, Hao lianchuan was speechless.
  "Minister, what about the ruins?"
 "We'll talk about it next month!"
 Hou Xiaochen chuckled and coughed lightly,"alright, that's it. Don't look for me for the next two days. My injuries are acting up again, and I'm feeling a little uncomfortable." Let me know when Li Hao comes to the White moon City in three days. "
 "Yes!"
 Hao lianchuan nodded.
 In his heart, he was cursing.
 Is that true?
 To be honest, he didn't really believe it now!
 You're injured, but you killed Xuguang with one shot. Who are you trying to fool?
 This fellow always treated himself as a parent and everyone else as children ... What a bully!
