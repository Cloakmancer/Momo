        lked to the side and touched the wall ... He felt as if he was pressing on cotton. It was soft, and when he pressed on it, it sank deeply.
         "What is this?"
         Li Hao was a little strange. It was very strong. Although it was soft, Li Hao couldn't break the wall even when he pinched it hard.
         Also, how did the person who entered die?
         This was also a problem.
         He raised his head again. Could it be related to the huge net?
         Was he killed by the net?
         Liu Long said that there seemed to be some treasure in this house, but he couldn't catch it. But Li Hao looked around and found nothing. Where did the treasure come from? it was just a small house.
         He looked around again, but he still didn't find anything.
         Li Hao sighed. Treasure my ass. The captain must have gone crazy thinking about treasures.
          At this moment, the net fell. Li Hao wanted to stop it, but he found that it was invisible and did not exist in reality. It was somewhat similar to the red shadow.
         The moment it landed on Li Hao's body, it suddenly disappeared!
         Li Hao didn't feel anything.
         In the next moment, while Li Hao was still confused, a key suddenly appeared in the air ... Yes, a key!
         It looked like the key to ancient civilization in the books.
         Li Hao was stunned for a moment before he grabbed the key.
         The key only appeared for a short while. It seemed that it would disappear if Li Hao didn't grab it.
         Li Hao grabbed the key.
         Just as Li Hao was about to take a closer look, the sealed door in front of him suddenly opened. Some light came in, which seemed to mean that he could go out.
         At this moment, Li Hao was very confused.
         What was going on?
         As he walked out, he grabbed the key and glanced at it. There were words on the key ... Li Hao could recognize all the words of the ancient civilization.
         "South City 7th Street, Tongfu Building 3rd floor, Room 302."
         Li Hao was stunned.
         This ... Why did it look like a hotel room key?
         At this moment, countless thoughts appeared in his mind.
         Everyone would enter this small house, get a seal, and obtain an admission permit. Then, they would be assigned a room in a restaurant. This meant that they had obtained the right to live.
         Was it like this?
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. What did obtaining the right to reside in mean?
         What could there be?
         Why didn't anyone else get the key?
         If he didn't get it, what did that mean?
         Also, this place seems to be accessible repeatedly. Could it be that I can obtain a key every time I enter ... What's the use of it?
         Strange!
          No, the houses here can't be entered or opened casually. Could it be that you can enter as you please with the key?  Many doubts appeared in Li Hao's mind.
         A moment later, he had already walked out of the light.
         When he came out, he was on the first street.
         Nan Quan and Hong Yitang had already come out. Nan Quan was frowning at this moment and transmitted his voice,""There seems to be something covering me and locking me down. Is that the flight permit you guys were talking about? Also, I vaguely saw something, but it disappeared in a flash. Unfortunately, I was in a hurry to get out, so I didn't dare to stay. Did you guys notice it?"
         At this moment, Hong Yitang didn't say anything.
         He was actually holding a key in his hand. The last time he entered, he had actually felt it, but unfortunately, he had not been able to grasp it. The first time, there were too few who could grasp it. It was too dark, and he could not see anything. How could he have the courage to do anything?
         This time, he had caught it.
         He had thought that it was some kind of treasure, but it turned out to be something like a key. However, there were some words on it ... He was not illiterate and could recognize some of them, but he could not recognize all of them.
         If one didn't study the ancient characters professionally, it would be hard to recognize all of them.
         Knowing a few of them was fine.
         For example, he recognized the word 'South' in the South.
         Hong Yitang was puzzled. He glanced at Li Hao and remembered that this kid seemed to be studying this with Yuan Shuo. He thought for a while and said,""Li Hao, do you know the characters of the ancient civilization?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Yes."
         "What is this?"
         As he spoke, he wrote a word in the air. Li Hao looked at him in surprise. After a while, he said,""It's the word 'courtyard'. Could it be that martial uncle is looking for a courtyard? Happy Red Court?"
         “……”
         Hong Yitang was speechless. What the hell were you thinking?
         "Courtyard"?
         The South something courtyard ...
         At this moment, Li Hao actually suspected that Hong Yitang had also obtained the key. Otherwise, why would he ask him this?
         It was very possible!
         As for Hong Yitang, he hesitated for a moment, wondering if he should let Li Hao see it. Perhaps this kid knew what it was. Every profession had its own specialty, and he wasn't familiar with this field. He wasn't like Yuan Shuo, who dug up graves and robbed graves.
         Looking outside, it seemed like someone was coming. He said as he walked,""Let's talk inside!"
          At this moment, hei Teng seemed to be approaching from the distance.
         Li Hao's group ignored hei Teng and directly walked toward him. As for hei Teng ... He didn't pay them any attention.
         First, they were martial masters.
         Secondly, the black Phoenix would ignore them once they entered the second passageway unless they were attacked by a superpower.
         After walking for a while, Hong Yitang hesitated for a moment, but still took out the key and handed it to Li Hao.""Let me see what this is. I got it when I explored some ruins. I wonder if it's useful."
         Li Hao was speechless!
         Go to hell!
         None of these people were telling the truth. The key was similar to the one he had just obtained.
         Written on it was Xuanji South City Fifth Street, Furong courtyard, Yunxiang Pavilion.
         Was this also a restaurant?
        
         Li Hao pondered for a moment. When everyone entered, a key would appear, which was their accommodation. But why were they not together, but scattered?
         They were all in the South City ... Where was the South City?
         It was pitch-black, and no one knew which direction he was in.
         The Fifth Street and the seventh Street were simple and clear.
         He was in Tung Fook mansion, and Hong Yitang was in Furong courtyard. Moreover, it seemed like he was only in a small room, but old Hong was actually assigned to some Yunxiang Pavilion. Wasn't it more luxurious?
         He looked back and frowned. Was there anyone else who could get the key?
         It might be really difficult to obtain it on the first time, but if he had the experience of the first time, it might not be so difficult.
         At this moment, seeing that he was silent, Hong Yitang transmitted his voice again,""Do you recognize it?"
         "Yes, South City 5th Street, Furong courtyard, Yunxiang Pavilion."
         Hong Yitang was startled. He was talking about heaven battling city?
          Strange!
         As for Nan Quan, he looked at Hong Yitang suspiciously. Where did you get this thing?
         Li Hao threw the key to the other party, not saying anything.
         Soon, the city gate could be seen.
         The moment he saw the city gate, Hong Yitang frowned again."As expected, Yinlu has appeared!"
         On the city gate tower, a white figure could be seen.
         A silver-tier warrior!
         "Uncle-master, did you sense the strength of the silver-tier warrior when he awakened?" Li Hao asked.
         "The last strike from the late-stage to the peak of the rising light realm ... Was probably comparable to one of the four great demons. It was even slightly stronger than the great snake!"
         Li Hao inhaled.
         So powerful?
         Hong Yitang was still frowning. Li Hao thought for a moment and said,""Do we have to deal with the other party before we can enter the city? If we take the second passage, perhaps ... We will be treated as guests. If we walk normally, can't we enter?"
         "How would I know?"
         Hong Yitang had never tried it before, so how would he know?
         However, from the way he got the key, he had the same thought. This was a kind of hospitality to the guests. If they held the key and went to the gate, would they be able to enter?
         ,m Li Hao recalled that the last time he went there, the city gate was opened. Did it mean that it didn't matter whether he had the key or not?  The first time, it didn't work because he didn't drip any blood.
         The second time, he had dripped his blood on the two words 'Zhan Tian'. Perhaps ... He could enter directly?
         Taking advantage of the fact that the people behind them hadn't arrived yet, Li Hao didn't waste any time and quickly walked toward the city gate. Some black-armored soldiers were still patrolling on both sides, as if they didn't see them.
         A moment later, Li Hao's group of three arrived at the gate.  Li Hao hesitated for a moment. He glanced at the silver-tier warriors in the Sky, pondered for a moment, and then took a step forward. At this moment, the two big words on the city gate seemed to flash. A moment later, the dusty gate opened again!
         It was silent!
         Hong Yitang, on the other hand, was stunned. He couldn't help but glance at Li Hao. Li Hao didn't say anything and just walked in!
         Hong Yitang also followed him in a hurry, his heart filled with shock!
         How could this be?
         As for the silver-tier warrior, he silently floated down. After glancing at Li Hao, he hammered his chest with his right hand, as if he was bowing. It was extremely strange. Li Hao also swallowed his saliva. This time, it was completely different from the last time!
         He didn't dare to be neglectful, and hurriedly beat his chest with his right hand as a return gift.
         This silver-tier warrior was no weakling!
         Around them, the black and copper daggers pounded their chests with their right hands, making clanking sounds!
         Li Hao's scalp tingled, but he was much stronger than last time. He suppressed the shock in his heart and walked in.
         Hong Yitang followed him in without any problems.
         Nan Quan was stunned and wanted to follow him in ... But suddenly, the silver-tier warrior extended his sword and blocked his way. His empty eyes looked at Nan Quan as if he was waiting for something.
         Southern Fist's scalp was also numb!
         Hong Yitang had told them about the other party's strength. The key was, why?
         Li Hao could enter, and so could Hong Yitang ... But why was he stopped?
         Li Hao pondered for a moment, then frowned slightly. Feeling somewhat helpless, he took out the key from his storage ring and threw it to Nan Quan. Nan Quan took the key and was a little dazed.
         Then ... The silver-tier warrior retracted his sword.
         Nan Quan was dumbfounded, then he quickly entered the city.
         After the three of them entered the city, they hurriedly left the vicinity of the city gate, and the city gate closed silently once again.
          At this moment, Nanquan said with a blank face,""Didn't you say that it's very difficult to enter?"
         We're in!
         He directly entered the inner city!
         What the hell?
         Also, the key ...
         While he was thinking, Li Hao snatched the key from him and stuffed it into his storage ring. At this moment, Hong Yitang said with a strange look in his eyes,""You can only enter with the key, right? So, whoever gets the key, there's no need to get into a conflict with these guards. They won't stop us at all. Heaven battling city ... Seems to be very hospitable. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They would never attack a guest with a key.
         Those who did not have the key and wanted to force their way in would be attacked by them.
         The big square in the outer city was considered a loophole. Or rather, there was no passage there originally and they could only use the second passage. If these people used the square, would they be considered intruders?
         As for Nan Quan, he couldn't help but ask,"what the hell is this? how can we enter the inner city directly?" Where did the key come from? You and Hong Yitang both have it, why don't I? Also, the silver warrior from before seemed to have saluted Li Hao. It was like a military salute from the ancient civilization. Why was that? I know a little about the situation when you guys went in last time. Why wasn't it like this the last time?"
        
         What the hell!
         Li Hao ignored him and looked around. At this moment, they had entered the inner city, and it was his first time. He glanced at a fixed map standing to the side. It seemed to be a map of the Urban area.
         He looked at it carefully for a while, trying to distinguish the words that still existed.
         In the South ...
         Soon, he saw the southern part of the city. Li Hao didn't say anything. He walked directly toward the southern part of the city. He made very little noise. On the side of the road, there were some houses, most of which were closed. On a Street, there might be one or two houses that were open, but they looked like normal houses.
         It was open. Li Hao mustered his courage and went in to take a look ... There were some simple furniture and decorations, no different from a normal residential area.
         However, Li Hao saw a divine power Stone in the corner.
         It looked like a wall lamp, and the divine power Stone was embedded in it.
         The energy in the divine power Stone seemed to have been exhausted. Li Hao frowned. What ... Did this mean?
         Did this mean that during the ancient civilization, these residents used the divine power stones as the energy source for the wall lamps?
          Such luxury?
         He didn't say anything else and quickly left. Seeing him come out and Li Hao still walking South, Hong Yitang hesitated and said,""To the South City?"
         The real treasure was in the middle.
         The Golden Warriors and the Black Tortoise seal were there.
         "Let's go to the place marked by the key. "
         Li Hao glanced at the empty street and said,""Since you've given us a place and a room, let's go and take a look. Maybe we'll find some unexpected gains."
         Hong Yitang thought for a while and nodded."That's fine. We can look at the opened rooms along the way. They got a lot of divine power stones last time, but they might have taken the ones nearby. Let's go deeper and take a look."
         Nan Quan was in a state of confusion at the moment, not knowing what was going on at all.
         As for directly entering the inner city ... He had been at a loss until now.
         Why?
         Unfortunately, the two of them did not explain at all. He had no choice but to follow them.
         This place must have been very prosperous in the past.
         The streets were very wide and the ground was very flat. Even after the passage of time, the houses here were still strong and stable, without any damage.
         This place might be a residential area.
         There weren't many shops. On both sides of the street, there were also some small courtyards with individual doors. After walking for a long time, one might see a small shop, but the door was closed. If the door was closed, it meant that it was dangerous. One couldn't enter casually, or they would die!
         An uninvited entry was a robbery!
         And heaven battling city did not welcome bandits.
         Li Hao paid attention to the houses on both sides to see if any of them were open. Last time, those people had obtained a lot of divine power stones, more than a hundred in total.
         Also, there were actually a few people who didn't manage to escape from the city last time.
         Was he dead now?
         He had now discovered that heaven battling city actually followed the rules.
         Yes, he followed the rules.
         As long as you follow their rules, there will be no danger. However, if you don't follow the rules, you will die in vain. There are many supers outside the city who will die this time!
         Other than hou Xiaochen, Kong Jie, and a few others, who else could not have killed the silver-tier warrior?
         After walking for a while, he suddenly looked towards the center of the city.
         There was a tall tower there.
         Vaguely, there was a light coming from that direction, illuminating the entire city. Although it was extremely weak, he could still see some places. Just now, it seemed that there was a line of sight cast over from that direction.
         Was someone looking at him?
         Li Hao frowned and became even more careful. In this place, following the rules was the most important thing!
          Don't mess around!  It was too dangerous!
         ……
         At the same time.
         Under the tower, a dog sniffed as if it had smelled a familiar scent.
         It wagged its tail for a while and wanted to run in that direction.
         It then looked up at the floating turtle. Seeing that the turtle didn't seem to notice, the Black Panther quickly jumped down from the high platform and ran off in the direction of the South City.
         The giant turtle was deathly still, as if it was a statue.
         His gaze turned towards the south of the city.
         Some thoughts slowly emerged.
         Fate was truly wondrous.
         The descendant of the demon subduing envoy was actually following the descendant of the Li family, one of the eight great families. Did he forget that his ancestor had almost been killed by the Li family's descendant?
         Thinking of the one from the Li family, he was a little confused.
         In this world ... Were there still those people?
         The incomparably powerful human King and the others, were they really dead?
         Was he considered Dead or Alive?
         The next moment, he cast his gaze outside the city.
         There were many people gathered there.
         Did they think that this was a Dead City?
         When friends come, there's good wine. When enemies come ... There's a coffin!
         The big turtle's eyes were a little dazed. In the mansion below, the gold-tier warrior suddenly stood up, as if he had felt something. The next moment, the black turtle seal floated in his hand.
         A moment later, there was an Army in black armor and bronze armor in the west and south of the city respectively. They were led by a silver-tier warrior and quickly passed through the city, heading toward the eastern gate.
         The enemy was here!
         Out of the four city guards, the East City guard had been destroyed. Today, the guards of the other three cities began to gather in the East City.
         The Black Tortoise seal emitted a faint radiance.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The city seemed to have come back to life.
         ……
         At this moment, the experts who had passed through the second passage quickly gathered near the city gate.
         Some couldn't bear it and wanted to fly over ... Last time, someone had flown over. Once they passed through the second passage, they would be safe.
          The only danger was the gold-tier warrior.
         However, just as someone flew up the city wall ... BOOM!
         A troop of black armored soldiers struck out with their long Spears and long swords. With a loud boom, a peak stage solar brilliance cultivator was turned into a sieve!
         There were guards on the city walls!
         In the distance, the figure of a silver-tier warrior appeared, causing the expressions of some people to change rapidly.
         Zi Yue and the others had all seen how strong the other party was. At this moment, Zi Yue quickly transmitted her voice,""Don't act rashly. This silver-tier warrior is very strong, and he'll be able to recover. Once he's recovered, he'll probably have the strength of a Sunglow, and he's not an ordinary Sunglow ... Don't act rashly!"
         Everyone looked at the city gate in the distance and frowned. This time, the guards had appeared again!
         In that case, he had to clear the game again?
         Hou Xiaochen's eyes were also strange. He looked around for a while, but didn't see Li Hao and the others. He felt even weirder. Did those people ... Go in?
         If that was the case ... Then things would be interesting!
        
         Clear the game again?
         No!
         This wasn't a game, this wasn't a checkpoint, this was a city, the heaven battling city!
         The Army had arrived at the city gates, yet they did not abide by the rules and repeatedly provoked the heaven battling city's defenders. This was a blasphemy against the strongest!
         Above the city.
         The three great White silvers gathered.
         At that moment, the three great silver-ranked soldiers had gathered 30 bronze-armored Centurions and 3000 soldiers.
         Heaven battling city, heaven battling Army!
         At this moment, as the superpowers gathered below, the eyes of the three silver-ranked beings shone.
         This is too much!
          The defending Army only guarded heaven battling city, but now, the enemy had come knocking on their door.
         "Kill!"
         A hoarse voice with an ancient charm came out of a silver-tier warrior's mouth. It had a strong mechanical taste.
         In the next moment, BOOM!
         The black torrent descended!
         Charge!
         Kill the enemy!
         After all these years, the heaven-battling Army could still fight on the battlefield.
         ……
         Under the city.
         Those superpowers were still making a ruckus. Why was there Black Phoenix again this time?
         Some people were still discussing."That's a good thing. The black armor is valuable. Look at the Wei Wu Army. A black armor is worth more than a divine power Stone. If we can get more, we will be rich ..."
         BOOM!
         Before he could finish his words, countless black armors fell from the city. Rumble! The massacre began.
         Long Spears, long swords, long blades ...
         The battle formation appeared.
         The 30 copper-armored warriors gathered and formed a charging formation, charging in with the form of blades.
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         "Ah!"
         Screams of pain were heard, and the people who were still discussing were shocked.
         Even the powerhouses were stunned. In the next moment, they all shouted,""Quick, kill the enemy ..."
         "Damn it, didn't they say that we'll be fine after going through the second passage?"
         "Why?"
         "Why are there so many black phoenixes ... Didn't they say that they were exterminated?"
         It was noisy and chaotic.
         These people were from different organizations and different forces. There were too many people who had entered this time. In total, there were more than 2000 people. At this moment, there were even people who had entered from the outside.
         Some people entered through the square, while others entered through the second passage.
         The moment the Army came down, some of the superpowers became anxious and flew into the air. Those who didn't take the second passage were killed on the spot. Those who took the second passage were also complaining!
         Before they could land on the ground, there was a loud bang. Three silver statues soared into the sky and directly started killing in the air!  "Annihilate!"
         The mechanical voice sounded again. At this moment, the heaven battling Army seemed to have been angered.
         This was because someone was provoking heaven battling city!
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         The battle instantly broke out. The black Phoenix was able to fight against the sunlight in the city and was extremely powerful. With three thousand Black Phoenix, not to mention the sunlight, even the three suns were running for their lives.
         At this moment, some of the Sunglow's faces also turned ugly.
         They had just arrived at the city gates, and such a sudden change had occurred. It was simply unimaginable.
         "Hou Xiaochen ..." One of the experts roared,"this is all part of your night patrol's scheme, right?"
         In the distance, hou Xiaochen didn't say anything as he quickly retreated with his men.
         F * ck your Grandpa!
         This matter has nothing to do with me.
         He was prepared, but not here.
         Who knew that such a situation would occur? heaven battling city suddenly had an additional 3000 guards. Needless to say, the guards from all four sides should have gathered at the East Gate.
         On the other side, Yama's King Pingdeng shouted,""We have to get rid of them. These black puppets are worth cities! We have many experts, and the black Phoenix is just a group of Dark Moon elites wearing black armor. No matter how many of us there are, we're still ants!"
         There were many black armors, but their copper armors were only equivalent to the peak of the radiant sun realm, and their silver Warriors were only equivalent to the three suns. It was not time for them to awaken yet.
         And this time, how many three suns and sunguang had come?
         As long as they worked together, it would not be difficult to deal with the three thousand black hou.
         However, all the large organizations and experts suddenly retreated at this moment. Very few people were willing to stand in the front. They all retreated. Even the experts who were still resisting quickly retreated.
         The experts quickly retreated.
         Hei Teng's attack was silent, but his killing intent was tangible. A large number of supers were killed on the spot. Even though they were not weak, they were quickly defeated by this powerful killing intent.
         The screams were endless!
         ……
         Behind them.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Chief Yu looked at hou Xiaochen, but hou Xiaochen's face was calm, as if he had not seen anything.
         Kong Jie also smiled and crossed her arms,"I didn't expect that there would be so many Black Phoenix. Old hou, it seems that your Wei Wu Army is fully equipped this time."
         3,000 black Vatican!
         Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything. After observing for a while, he said in a soft voice,"Why do you think the heaven battling Army suddenly attacked us? When we were in the second passage, as long as we don't provoke them, they won't do anything to us ... But now, don't you think that these undead warriors seem to be more energetic?"
         "You mean ... Someone is commanding them?" Kong Jie was stunned.
          "Yes."
         Hou Xiaochen looked at the tall city gates, and it was as if he could see through them. He suddenly rose into the air and looked into the city. Within the city ... He could faintly see some lights.
         No, perhaps it was a reflection of gold.
         The gold-tier Warriors had awakened again?
         Hou Xiaochen frowned slightly. He was surprised by this sudden change as well. Could it be related to Li Hao?
         Would the eight great families still have such a close relationship after all these years?
         That's strange!
         ……
         Within the city.
         Li Hao and the others also heard the noise. At this moment, Li Hao climbed to the roof of an open house and looked out. He could vaguely see the outside. This building was very tall, only a little shorter than the turtle Tower.
        
         Li Hao stood there and watched. As he watched, he suddenly smiled.
         Nan Quan and the others also came up. Nan Quan was a little surprised."Why ... Why are there so many black flames attacking them? Didn't they say that we won't be attacked by hei Teng if we go through the second passage?"
         Li Hao said calmly,"there are so many superpowers. It's a mess. Maybe someone did something to anger them. This is a group of reasonable and law-abiding soldiers. Maybe someone revealed an attacking stance, maybe someone climbed over the city wall, maybe someone attacked the city gate ... All these will arouse their hostility. In the eyes of the heaven battling Army, this is provocation!"
         Hong Yitang frowned slightly and glanced at Li Hao.""You seem to be more composed than last time."
         "My strength is much stronger than last time, so naturally I'll be more relaxed, and ... I found that heaven battling city is very interesting, it's a place that follows rules. In that case, I'll just follow their rules, so there won't be too much danger. There's no reason for me to deal with some guests."
         He then smiled."The last time I came, I just treated it as a simple adventure. I didn't feel much. I just thought that this was a destroyed city. I came here to look for treasure!"
         "What about this time?"
         "This time ... I think this is a city with a soul."
         Li Hao laughed."Compared to the people outside, perhaps these dead soldiers are more adorable. Although they died a long time ago and only left behind some obsessions, they gave me the feeling that they were also of flesh and blood!" I'm thinking, maybe ... This is a real Martial Master, a real soldier, and not the soldiers who rule over their own territories ... He's different!"
          "You don't like the current military law Department?" Hong Yitang raised his eyebrows and smiled.
         "No."
         Li Hao shook his head, thought for a moment, and said,"rotten ... Feudal!" Perhaps, this was the drawback of the incomplete reform. Back then, the imperial family retreated behind the scenes and the nine divisions took charge, but the reform might not have been thorough. I realized that the nine divisions and the provincial administrative organizations today ... Are all focused on their own. "
         "I don't care if the war breaks out or not, whether the civilians die or not, whether the transportation is convenient or not, whether the food can be harvested or not, whether the city is in chaos or not ... I don't care!"
         Li Hao smiled."They're all thinking about their own plans. They're setting up their own small military groups and training their own experts. They're ready to dominate a region." Up until now, the only troops I've truly encountered that are similar to this Army are the Silver City's demon-hunting squads. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "A group of people, under the leadership of Captain Liu Long, expelled the darkness!"
         "They are weak, but they are thinking about how to make silver City happy."  "Although the Silver City is small, it's very safe ... The red moon is too strong. The problems he created don't count. In the past twenty years, at least, there hasn't been any brutal murder cases in this small place."
         "After entering the Whitemoon city, I discovered that the Whitemoon city, with a population of thirty million, was supported by the four major organizations and countless experts, but ... It seems that the people of the Whitemoon city are not as happy as the people of the Silver City."
         "When Whitemoon city's three great armies are faced with an external enemy, will they be like them, charging forward without caring about death, just to slash at the enemy with their swords?"
         At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt emotional.
         He looked at the charging black-armored warriors, then at the city, which was completely empty.
         "You see, in order to protect this city, they are willing to draw their swords and fight even after the passage of time ... Martial uncle Hong, where do you think these people's beliefs come from? That kind of pride, calmness, willingness to fight to the death ... I'm thinking, what kind of faith could make them do this?"
          It was unbelievable!
         Hong Yitang was silent for a while. After a long time, he sighed and said,""There are many reasons. Powerful enemies, charming leaders, beautiful homes, United beliefs, the same goal, the confidence of the people ... All of these filled these people with fighting spirit!"
         He continued,"actually, there are still such Warriors, it's just that ... It's not obvious now!" You said that Silver moon's three armed forces won't have such a situation, but that's not necessarily the case. It's just that ... Do you know why the soldiers now seem to have no faith and no fighting spirit?"
         "Martial uncle, please enlighten me!"
         "Goal and belief ... Why are we fighting, for whom, and what is our ultimate goal?"
         Hong Yitang said in a deep voice,"now, the war between the armies is an internal war! This dynasty is still unified, so everyone is a soldier of the dynasty. Unless you kill the three major organizations, it's actually a civil war no matter who you fight!"
         "Can a civil war stimulate people's passion and faith?"
         Hong Yitang shook his head and said,"no!" "That's why everyone values the strong and ignores the military. In fact, if silver Moon were to truly become independent now and have a noble goal to bring about some massive changes, to be willing to lead these people on a new path and out of decay ... Perhaps this would be the key to Silver moon's three armies 're-emergence. "
         He looked out of the city and at the cultivators flying in the sky.""Independence is not for the sake of hegemony! Now, the time was actually not right. Silver Moon can still hold on, but once he's truly in deep waters, if someone is willing to step out and wave their arms, they might be able to awaken their faith!"
        
         After Hong Yitang finished speaking, he said in a low voice,"actually, it'll be soon." As the war continues, some problems have already appeared in many provinces in the central region. Perhaps many people have not noticed this. Some places in the central region have been suffering from a crop failure for many years!"
         "The officials of the various provinces are getting restless and are secretly purchasing grain. In fact, the price of food on the market has already increased by 30%! This is only the beginning. As the war-torn zones expand, the daily consumption of the star dynasty, which has a population of ten billion, is an astronomical figure!"
         "Some of the good fields used to be rich in grain, but now they are gradually barren. No one dares to go out and farm. Even if they do, they may not reap a single grain after a battle!"
         Hong Yitang sighed again."Now, because the dynasty is rich and has a large territory, it's not obvious after a few years of war." But very soon ... It will explode!"
         "Actually, many people are watching, waiting, waiting for these situations to happen."
         "Once such a chaotic era breaks out, it will be their opportunity. Chaotic times produce heroes, and chaotic times ... Also produce formidable heroes!"
         Hong Yitang chuckled."Silver Moon is considered fine. Actually, the administration is quite responsible for this. They've been doing large-scale farming in the past few years, spreading new experiences, new discoveries, and new technologies ... But even so, the surroundings are in chaos, so Silver Moon probably won't be able to stay quiet."
         Li Hao frowned as he listened.
         Nan Quan also raised his brows slightly and glanced at Hong Yitang.
          To be honest, everyone in the martial arts world and the supernatural realm was chasing after strength. Few people would consider this. The heroes in the chaotic world might have seen it and seen through it, but they were all adding fuel to the fire!
         They even took the initiative to stop the planting of some fertile fields and waited for the harvest to run out.
         Ordinary people were weak, but once they were starving to the extreme, the power that everyone erupted with was enough to overthrow this dynasty and set off wars and revolutions.
         Commoners don't have much to pursue, but ... You can't let them go hungry!
         When a person was extremely hungry, they would do anything.
         After all, supers were a minority. Even if you could suppress ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million ... What about ten million, a hundred million, a billion?
         Li Hao's face was slightly pale. The rolling waves seemed to be right in front of him.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He looked at Hong Yitang ... To be honest, even if Li Hao was a commoner, the silver Blizzard city's people could still be considered wealthy. Thus, it was hard for him to imagine that these scenes recorded in the history books would happen in this era!
         With the advent of advanced technology and the spread of ancient technology, he felt that there would be no famine in this era.
         However, at this moment ... As Hong Yitang described the scene, he seemed to have seen it happen. A great force swept across the world, white bones were buried, and the sky and earth cracked!
         Public opinion could not be violated!
         "Old Hong, aren't you exaggerating?" Nan Quan couldn't hold back.
         Hong Yitang laughed,'am I exaggerating? It was not an exaggeration. What I said is the truth. Some people saw it and pretended not to see it, some people really didn't see it, some people deliberately let this scene happen, and some people ... Are really stupid!"  "That's why Li Hao asked why the soldiers of this era are not as good as those of the ancient civilization. I gave him the answer ... It's not the right time yet!"
         "When this era is in complete chaos, when these people feel that their homes behind them will be destroyed ... They will also burst out with unimaginable brilliance!"
         He pointed at the people outside."Some of these people may understand now, and some may not. But when the time comes, some may become Saints, some may become villains, some may become overlords, and some may become butchers!"
         "What about you?" he looked at Li Hao.
         Li Hao was confused.
         What about me?
         "You're the same as them, right?"
         Hong Yitang laughed."You actually saw it. You even felt it. But don't you think that it has nothing to do with you?" If this matter didn't concern him, he would hang it high up! What does this era have to do with you? Your parents are dead, your friends are dead, and your teacher is your only relative. So, do you really care about the people of the Silver City? Liu Long's belief is to protect the Silver City's safety. What about you? You're thinking, when I was weak, I just listened. Do you really take it seriously?"
         "You called Liu Long out. Liu Long was thinking that once I became stronger, I would return to protect the Silver City! And you? What you're thinking is that once you're strong enough, you'll go and kill all of Hong Yue's enemies. Have you ever thought about what will happen to Silver City?"
         "No." Hong Yitang shook his head and chuckled,"in this era, everyone lives for themselves! The human heart is selfish, human nature is also selfish. To be honest, whether it's the martial arts world or the supers, how many people are really willing to consider the civilians?"
         Li Hao's mind wandered.
          'I ...'
         Hong Yitang seemed to be right.
         That's right, he had never considered this point. The "protecting justice" that Liu Long had mentioned was just his slogan. He only felt that this would make him more righteous. But what exactly was justice?
         He didn't understand!
         He looked at Hong Yitang with a confused expression.
         Hong Yitang didn't say anything else.
         There was nothing much to say.
         This wasn't something that could be explained in a single sentence. If you didn't understand, then you didn't understand. If you understood ... Then you understood!
         One day, when Li Hao saw corpses and starved corpses strewn all over the ground, he would feel heartache, pity, blame himself, and regret for these people. Only then did Li Hao truly understand that if he felt that those who had died were just a group of ants ... There was actually no need to say anything.
        
         Even if he had such feelings, he still needed to do something. If he didn't do anything, it would only be a moment of pity!
         At this moment, Nan Quan's expression also changed.""Hong Yitang, you've said so much, what about you?"
         What have you done this time?
         Hong Yitang laughed,"me? What can I do? I can't do much, the only thing I can do is to make the swords gate a little safer, a little more peaceful, a little more worry-free about food and clothing ... On the swords Gate Mountain, the family of the swords gate disciples, I'm taking care of them, they are also working hard to live, to get rich, to have no worries about food and clothing, to cut off from the chaos of the outside world, that's all I can do. "
         "I'm just an ordinary person, not a Saint. "
         Hong Yitang sighed,"actually, I couldn't see or understand these things." As a Martial Master who had been wandering in the martial world for a long time, we ate meat and drank wine in our time. To be honest, what did the civilians have to do with us?"
         "Until one day, I met a group of orphans by accident. Some of their parents starved to death, some of their parents died in the war, some of their parents died in the chaotic world of the martial world, and some of their parents left their homes to become strong ... At that time, I suddenly had a little enlightenment!"
         Just a little bit!
         He never called himself a Saint, and he was not one. However, there were more orphans in swords gate. Perhaps, this was one of the rare compassion of the strong in this era.
         That was why he could tell Li Hao all this today. Otherwise, he would only say that the soldiers of this era were not as strong as they had been in the past.
          Was it because he was not strong enough?
         It wasn 't!
         There were almost 2000 supers outside. If they worked together, they could easily defeat the 3000 black Vatican, but ... So what?
         Did they have faith?
         Other than knowing how to become stronger and how to seize treasures, what other beliefs could he have?
         Weren't the three people in the arena the same?
         In this era, people were cold-blooded.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Muddle-headed, Li Hao looked outside and saw the black-armored flood charging forward. They turned into sharp blades and charged into the enemy lines. They were constantly fighting. Even after all these years, this Army was still fighting!
         Why were they fighting?
         He shook his head and looked at Hong Yitang. He suddenly felt ... This person was terrifying!
         Yes, it was terrifying.
         He had easily wavered, confused, and even wavered in his beliefs.
         A moment later, Li Hao took a deep breath and walked down the building.
         He didn't want to see it anymore.
         He just wanted to find some treasures, get them, get stronger, get out, and then ... Take revenge on Hong Yue.
         MMH!
         He was the selfish person that Hong Yitang had talked about. Why not?
          What does the world's ignorance and suffering have to do with me?  It didn't matter!
         I'm one of them, a victim as well, and no one came to save me ... Oh, there are, teacher, Liu Long, hou Xiaochen ...
         These people had actually saved him before.
         Then why should I go and save others?
         How strange!
         Li Hao felt that Hong Yitang was thinking too much. Those people were not related to him, so why did he have to think about them?
         So what if the world was destroyed?
         ……
         Behind them.
         Nan Quan looked at Hong Yitang and frowned. He transmitted his voice,""Hong Yitang, what have you been trying to comprehend all these years? Why ... Why are you worried about the country and the people?"
         This was not a Martial Master!
         Hong Yitang glanced at him and laughed. He transmitted his voice,""I'm thinking about the path of a Martial Master, and the purpose of a Martial master's existence! I've read an ancient book before, it says that a hero should serve the country and the people ... At first glance, I thought it was a joke! I think it's a bit exaggerated. A warrior can be a hero? What was a chivalrous man? he punished the strong and helped the weak, fought for justice, acted bravely for justice, and worried about the country and its people ... These were the true chivalrous men! In today's martial arts world, how could there still be any swordsmen? They're just a bunch of unscrupulous martial artists who want to become stronger!"
         "You are, me too, Yuan Shuo is, and everyone else is!"
         "All these years, I've flipped through this ancient book again, and I've had some different thoughts. Maybe it's a little childish, maybe it's a little idealistic, but I've been thinking, what's the purpose of people becoming stronger? Immortal? Stand aloof from worldly affairs? Invincible? And then?"
         Hong Yitang laughed and said,"then ... They turned into bones!" After a few years, no one will remember you. If someone as strong as Yuan Shuo were to die in Silver City, would the people of Silver Moon still remember him? Did he bring about some sort of change to Silver Moon? Did he give birth to a Buddha? Does his strength bring any help to the billions of people?"
         Nanquan's throat moved.
          Did I?
         Of course not!
         Impossible. Martial masters ... They were competitive and killed in all directions. All of this was to become stronger, to become stronger, to find the way, to seek Dao ...
         As for what would happen after the Dao competition?
         There's no more!
         What else could it be?
         At this moment, he was a little scared. He looked at Hong Yitang and suddenly felt that this guy was very scary!
         "Hong Yitang ... You ... What are you thinking about?"
         "What are you doing?" Hong Yitang laughed. I'm just thinking about my own life. I'm thinking that there are always people who say that the existence of Martial Master superpowers is for killing ... I think it's true, but is the purpose of killing just killing? The ultimate goal of killing is to kill? Isn't that too narrow-minded?"
         "Killing is just a process, not an end! Don't get this concept mixed up. Li Hao had the same idea. I became strong to kill ... And then? After killing, what happens in the end?"
        
         Nan Quan felt a chill in his heart. He looked at Hong Yitang again and suddenly wanted to stay away from him!
         Sometimes, people really couldn't see through this person.
         "Stop looking. I'm not a saint. I'm just thinking. Do I have to be confined even when I'm thinking? The ancient book says,"don't imprison a person's thoughts." You can imprison my body, but you can't imprison my thoughts. As long as my thoughts are there, I'm still alive. When my thoughts are also imprisoned, I'm really dead. "
         "The star dynasty is actually very rotten!"
         Hong Yitang said as he walked,'this dynasty is actually restricting people's thoughts! The education was underdeveloped, and the People's wisdom was not developed. Everything must be drawn from the ancient civilization. If you don't know how to develop it, you have to study it. "
         "The education system is not perfect at all! Take Silver City for example. There were millions of people. How many of them were knowledgeable and cultured? The silver Blizzard city's ancient Academy is a treasure, and there are only one or two thousand students. Could it be that out of a million people, there are only a few cultured people?"
         "Silver Moon is a huge place with a population of hundreds of millions. I've actually observed and calculated the number of schools. I'm not sure, but I know that there are only 37 higher education institutions and about 200000 people. "A batch every four years, and about 50000 people graduate every year ..."
         "If we calculate based on an average of 40 years of work per person, after 40 years, 2 million people will graduate from higher education institutions ... And these 2 million people are the high-end people and elites of the entire society. There are 100 million people and 2 million high-level talents. Do you think this is too much or too little?"
         "The higher level students take up 2% of the total, and the middle and low level students take up 10 times that. 20% is an overestimation! In fact, only 22% of the total population can read. What do you think of this ratio?"
         "Is it low?" Nan Quan asked in a deep voice.
          ,m He didn't think it was low! This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Besides, the literacy rate is already very high. It's more than 20%. I remember that it wasn't so high in the past. This means that one out of five people can read now. Decades ago, only a few people could read out of a hundred people. Is there a problem?"
         He really didn't think there was anything wrong with it.
         It's already very powerful, alright!
         Hong Yitang laughed and shook his head,"you ... As expected ... Forget it. I'm too lazy to talk to you! Read more books, read some ancient books, read again, and think again. Why were the ancient civilizations so powerful? What would you think if I told you that the literacy rate was as high as 99% during the ancient civilization? Yes, except for a very small number of people, everyone is literate!"
         "Literacy is the foundation of a country and a nation! Don't expect a group of illiterate people to teach you knowledge, change your life, and strengthen your path. Yuan Shuo is illiterate, can he find his own new path?"
         At this moment, Hong Yitang also felt that the southern Fist was like a cow playing the zither.
         Forget it, why are you saying this!
         "There's one more thing. Among the nine divisions, there's no division that's specifically in charge of education. The establishment of higher education institutions is actually led by the local authorities. It's very casual. "Also, the ancient people knew to persuade the farmers and pity them. In this era, we're so advanced that we have planes and cannons, but there's no special Agricultural Department to help these people develop new land and cultivate new seeds. We only know how to rely on the heavens to survive and the mountains to survive ..."
         "The star dynasty's reform is actually a joke. The imperial family retreated behind the scenes only because they are not as powerful as others. Everyone only looks at strength, who cares about other things?"
         "Actually, the Silver Moon Administrative Bureau is not bad. Those surnamed Zhao and Zhou have been doing well these years, but ... They are still blind!"
         Nan Quan looked at him in a daze. At this moment, he even felt that he didn't know who he was!
         Was this the earth overturning sword?
         "You're a Martial Master ..."  "That's right. That's why I said that a hero should serve the country and the people. I can't do it, so I'm a Martial Master, not a swordsman!"
         He was not a hero!
         He chuckled and didn't feel that there was anything wrong with it. He didn't deserve to be called a hero, and no one else did. In this era, there were only a group of martial masters.
         Perhaps, one day, this era would also produce such a swordsman?
         He looked at Li Hao and shook his head.
         Forget it!
         This Li Hao was probably a Martial Master too. Just like them, he was already being fair by not killing innocents, but he was destined to never become a hero.
         The main thing was that no one had such a concept.
         Should martial masters work for the welfare of the civilians?
         Since ancient times, he had never had such an idea.
         "No... Liu Long ..."
         At this moment, he suddenly thought of a person. It was a little strange. This guy was actually quite interesting.
         Although his strength wasn't much, it had to be said that in this era, thinking about protecting the people was from the bottom of one's heart. In fact, it was very special. Of course, he was only in Silver City. This way ... Perhaps he could be called a hero, but the hero was in Silver City.
          In fact, it was very good. He was stronger than many martial masters!
         For many martial masters, their so-called home was just a place to live. If it was destroyed, they would find another place to continue living.
         ……
         The sounds of battle outside continued.
         Li Hao was walking in a daze.
         Higher up, the huge turtle was looking at someone, not Li Hao, but Hong Yitang.
         He was slightly dazed.
         He seemed to have heard something, or felt something.
         A hero ...
         Looking down at the surroundings, looking down at this land, who could be called a hero?
        
         This person might not make it either.
         However, this person reminded it of another person, an extremely powerful existence, a King of humans in a special era, a person who always said 'education is heaven, no matter how poor you are, you can not be poor in education'.
         Of course, that was a long time ago.
         Actually, it didn't look like it.
         Compared to that person, this person was far inferior, far, far inferior!
         That person was the beacon of light for that era. That person was also the beacon of light for the future human King, the life mentor.
         And in that era, there were actually many such people.
         They knew what they were fighting for.
         They knew what the future was.
         They also knew that self-improvement and independence, and everyone being like a dragon, were the foundation of a powerful era.
          That was why they created that era, a different era, an era that was rarely seen in ancient times. Everyone who lived in that era was proud, proud!
         No matter how bitter, tired, or dangerous it was, with a single order, tens of thousands of people would die and fight until the last drop of blood was shed!
         No one would regret it. They would look back, expel the darkness, and create light.
         And now, perhaps ... They had also fallen into darkness.
         In this era, who could ignite the light of heaven battling city?
         In this era, who could once again lead heaven battling city to slash through the heavens?
         No one else!
         The old turtle closed its eyes again.
         No more ...
         In this era, there was no more hope.
         At least, it didn't see or feel it.
         That person just now might be the last flame, but unfortunately, he didn't seem to be much.
         With a single thought ...
         At this moment, Hong Yitang, who was still walking, suddenly froze. He looked down and saw a storage ring on the ground.
         He was stunned for a moment. He picked it up and took a look. Then ... He was stunned!
         Yes, he was stunned.
         Li Hao and Nan Quan also felt the movement and looked at him in surprise. Storage ring?
         Picked it up?
         Hong Yitang blinked his eyes, thinking that he was dreaming. The next moment, he suddenly kicked Nan Quan.
         The southern Fist was furious!
         "What are you doing?" he asked.
         "He Yong, do you think ... That I can pick up money when I go out? does God think that I'm too poor and take pity on me?"
         “……”
         Li Hao was also very curious."Senior uncle Hong, what did you pick up? is there anything inside?"
         Hong Yitang nodded numbly.
         In the next moment, after thinking for a moment, he suddenly had an idea. Then ... Li Hao and Nan Quan were dumbfounded, their eyes wide open.
         That was ... That was a divine energy stone that was even bigger than a head!
         艹!
         Not only that, but the light inside was not as dark as the ordinary divine power stones. It was crystal clear at first glance, and he even suspected that it was a divine power Stone!
         However, at this moment, after sensing it ... It seemed to be true!
         Hong Yitang also gasped!
         F * ck!
         What did I do?
         'I just stepped on it, why ... Why did I pick up a storage ring with such a big rock ... No, a big treasure!'
         He was very confused!
         Furthermore, there were three of such huge rocks in the storage ring.
         Yes, three pieces!
         That wasn't all. There was also a small bottle of liquid sealed inside. It seemed to be very valuable. Hong Yitang didn't know what it was, but he didn't open it. He was still confused.
         After looking around for a long time, he suddenly cupped his fists and said,""A blessed land! A treasure land! Heaven battling city is simply my second home in my life. Perhaps my ancestors were members of heaven battling city. Li Hao, you guys should say goodbye to each other! This place is amazing!"
         Nan Quan was dumbfounded. He looked at the stone and swallowed his saliva. After a long time, he said with great difficulty,""These ... Top-grade divine power stones ... If you cut them out ... There should be at least ... 3000 pieces, right?"
         One stone might be equivalent to three ordinary stones, which would be tens of thousands of divine power stones!
         He was really stunned.
         Li Hao was also dumbfounded. At this moment, he couldn't help but look at the big turtle in the distance ... Speaking of which, old Hong couldn't have picked up the money on purpose by some sentient creatures, right?
          Why?  One had to know that there was nothing in this city. It was clean, and the ground could even absorb things. The storage ring had been here for countless years, but it was still here?
         What's going on?
         If there were sentient creatures in the city, it would be impossible.
         But why did he give it to old Hong?
         Li Hao scratched his head. He didn't think about it until this moment. Was it because of what old Hong had said?
         Were those words priceless?
         Could it be that it resonated with him?
         Li Hao fell into deep thought. As for the huge divine power Stone, he didn't pay much attention to it. Everyone had their own opportunities. No one said that Hong Yitang couldn't have an opportunity.
         Li Hao was just thinking ... If even the existences in the ancient city felt that these words were valuable, then these words might be his greatest gain.
         He looked at Hong Yitang again. This lazy and unkempt man suddenly seemed a little mysterious at this moment.
         Hong Yitang kept the benefits and grinned.
         He couldn't stop smiling!
         What good day is it today?
         He was so happy!
         This city was great.
         "Let's go find my place. Since we're already here, let's take a break and go shopping ..."
         Hong Yitang chuckled. As he walked, he looked at the buildings around him and mumbled,""There are so many schools in such a small city. I seem to have seen at least five schools on my way here ... Could it be that ... The ancient city sensed that I was building more schools and rewarded me?"
         It was very strange!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, also heard this. He looked around and saw what seemed to be a school ahead.
         Along the way, he did see many similar buildings.
         He frowned slightly. Why were they building so many schools?
         This small city had at most a million people, right?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They hadn't even reached the end of the street yet. Could it be that there were more than a hundred schools in the entire city?
         If that was the case ... These ancient people were really rich!
         Not only did he have money, but he also had energy.
         If he remembered correctly, there were only a dozen schools in Silver City, which was not bad.
         In this era, wasn't it better to work and earn money earlier than to study?
         Studying was a waste of time.
         As for Li Hao, his grades were good, and his grades were bad, so he had long since stopped studying.
         At this moment, the three of them were silent as they continued to move forward, silently looking around. This small heaven battling city gave them a different feeling.
         Nan Quan also looked on silently. The small city was very small, far from being as prosperous as Sky Star City.
         However, through some of the buildings, one could see how happy and blissful heaven battling city had been in the past.
         They lived in peace and contentment, happy and satisfied.
         Perhaps, only a city like this was worthy of the soldiers guarding it, wasn't it?
         If the stellarsky city was in chaos, how many soldiers would be willing to protect it?
         As the three of them walked, the noise outside the city and the silence inside the city formed two worlds. I'll protect you outside, and you'll live and work in peace inside, creating a beautiful and harmonious life together.
         Perhaps, it was like this during the ancient civilization!
         At this moment, Li Hao thought of Liu Long.
         One day, the night patrolmen received some flower baskets, fruits, and specialties. No one knew who sent them, but no one cared. Only Liu Long ate an Apple and smiled.
         He looked outside the city. If the Army outside the city won and returned triumphantly, would the people in the city still give them flowers and applause? would they give them good food and drink and warmly welcome them?
         "It's really ... An infatuated feeling!"
         Li Hao muttered in his heart. Perhaps this feeling was very interesting, very interesting?
          Who knows!
         'Anyway, I've never experienced it before, and I've never had such thoughts.
         As for Nan Quan, he was also thinking about something. Many years ago, not long after he became a Martial Master, he had killed a ferocious Tiger. He didn't think much of it, but in the end, the locals had sent him a lot of food and wine.
         He drank to his heart's content. What did the villagers call him at that time?
         Warrior?
         Hero?
         Or ... A hero?
         I forgot!
         It was too long ago. Who would remember it? they only remembered that the wine that day was so beautiful!
         But where could they find such good wine in that small village?
        
         He could only think about flowers and wine at this moment.
         In the end, Hong Yitang's words only left a trace and disappeared with the wind. Perhaps one day, it would be triggered again. But at this moment, it only made Li Hao and Nan Quan think a little more, but it didn't really change anything.
         And Hong Yitang actually didn't have this intention.
         He was just expressing his thoughts and thinking about his own path.
         As for who to guide and who to change, it was not his original intention. He just could not help but think, reflect, and think about whether he was right or wrong in those decades of roaming the martial world.
         The earth-overturning sword had become famous all over the world. Later on, it went into seclusion and gradually fell behind. This was also a process of his thinking.
         No one could understand him, and he didn't need to be understood. He just needed to do what he wanted to do, and in the process, he could show a trace of pity. That was enough.
         However, all of this was not as shocking as the storage ring.
         I'm rich!
         Therefore, Hong Yitang was all smiles. He no longer had the sorrowful feeling he had just now. There was only excitement and joy.
          He had probably never seen so much money in his life.
         Happiness!
         Nanquan was both envious and jealous. Li Hao also laughed, revealing a Fox-like profoundness. Would overhand sword need his help?
         If he were to find one, with such a rich person ... Wouldn't two-thirds of his money be deducted?
         Ahem ... One-third.
         Two-thirds was too much. One-third was the fee for the small sword's hard work. If the starry sky sword didn't collect a fee for its hard work, would it be worthy of the starry sky sword?
         As the three of them chatted, they arrived at South Street.
         South City 5th Street, Furong courtyard, Yunxiang Pavilion.
         The southern part of the city was the commercial district.
         There were some tall buildings here, but they weren't that tall compared to the outside world.
         The streets here were very wide, and there were shops everywhere.
         "Tea,""wine,""meal,""clothes ..."
         Flags fluttered in the wind, and huge signboards allowed guests to clearly distinguish where they were going.
         Almost all of them were closed. Li Hao followed the signs and looked around.
         A moment later, he led the two in a certain direction.
         Nan Quan was in the dark and almost couldn't recognize any of them. Hong Yitang, on the other hand, could recognize some ancient characters and could barely distinguish the direction.
         Outside the city, the sounds of killing continued.
         In the city, the three of them were walking on the quiet streets. It was exceptionally peaceful.
         After walking for a while, an ancient-looking courtyard appeared in front of everyone. Hong Yitang hurriedly took out the key. The words on it were the same as the words on the plaque.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Furong yard?"
         Hong Yitang glanced at Li Hao. Li Hao nodded and looked around. It was extremely quiet. Only this large courtyard occupied a large area. Some eaves could be seen inside the walls.
         At this moment, the huge courtyard gate was closed.
         Can it be activated?
         The Yunxiang Pavilion might just be one of the houses in this large courtyard and not the entire place.
         "Martial uncle Hong, let's go in and take a look,"  Li Hao said, but Hong Yitang handed the key to Nan Quan,""Old he, let's go in and take a look,"
         He Yong's face turned black!
         This key might only be the key to the internal Yunxiang Pavilion, but the door of this courtyard is closed. If I open it, what if I die?
         Li Hao surmised,"it should be fine. Furong yard should be a restaurant or hotel. We're now in a public area, not private property. According to the rules of heaven battling city, nothing will happen. Martial uncle he, push the door open and take a look."
         He Yong glanced at Li Hao, then at Hong Yitang ... Why didn't you guys push the door open?
         Since you said it's fine, why do you want me to go?
         Hong Yitang and Li Hao looked at him in silence.
         Of course you're going!
         Li Hao is too weak, and Hong Yitang can stay behind just in case. You're in the middle. If you don't go, do you think we'll go?
         Besides, I have to take a risk to bring you into the inner city safely. Otherwise, you won't get any of the benefits later.
         Southern Fist was speechless.
         Even though no one said a word, he already understood the meaning behind it.
         He took a deep breath and cursed in his heart, but he still gathered his courage and pushed the door open.
         The huge courtyard gate let out a slight squeak.
         It seemed to be half-hidden and not completely sealed. As He Yong pushed, the door gradually opened.
         ……
         A moment later, the three of them saw the situation inside the courtyard.
         There was a bluestone path with some pavilions on both sides, a winding dry river, and rockery ...
         It was obvious that this was a hotel with a beautiful environment.
         It was a pity that the flowers and grass had withered and the spring water had dried up. Now, only some traces of the beautiful scenery from back then were left. However, it was very clean. The only thing was that the flowers and grass had withered, making the two sides of the road seem a little bare.
         "Hu!"
         Nanquan let out a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he was fine.
         He was scared to death!
         As for Li Hao, he had already walked in and passed the gate. After the others entered, he said,""Close the door, in case someone comes in and sees that this place is open."
          A normal person would not dare to push the door open if they knew it was dangerous.
         He Yong didn't say anything and quickly closed the door.
         As for Li Hao, he walked to another sign. On it were some names of places and some arrows.
         "The drifting cloud Pavilion."
         "Fragrance Pavilion."
         "Water charm Pavilion."
         “……”
         They were all places. In the end, Li Hao saw the name "Yunxiang Pavilion." There was an arrow on it, pointing to the depths.
         "Move forward!"
         Li Hao strode forward. He Yong only felt that this courtyard was somewhat uncomfortable and awkward. As he walked, he said telepathically,""Let's go and find this place. What's the use of it? This place was probably a place to rest. Could there be other treasures? Would you leave the treasure in the hotel?"
