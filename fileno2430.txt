Silver City.In the end, Li Hao decided on this place.He was born and grew up here.If they were really unlucky and died here, it could be considered as returning to their roots.This place was also sealed by the venerable sovereigns. The eight main cities stood here, and the world's fate was here. The key was that the silver Blizzard city had fought many battles, and Li Hao was always the winner.It could also be considered a lucky place for him.He had killed Ying Hongyue and the Heavenly King in this place.This place carried Li Hao's luck.Even though heaven's will had been abandoned, luck ... Who said that it had to be related to heaven's will?The Army retreated.Of the eight main cities, seven were still standing above the Silver City, acting as seals to seal the venerable sovereign's true body.And every city had an expert in charge. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, Li Hao was wandering between heaven and earth. He looked at the seal and seemed to be thinking about something.​ The true body of a venerable sovereign!The eight main cities were also divine weapons in essence. Powerful divine weapons controlled by Saints could even stop Heavenly Kings. Of course, when the eight main cities were really used, the seals would be broken.At this moment, the various saints and Dao integration stage super mighty figures were all stationed in the city.Did Li Hao really not suspect anyone?That was unlikely.As the saying goes,'don't use the person you suspect, and use the person you use, don't doubt'. Although that was what it said, the experts under him had complicated backgrounds. How could he not be on guard?Those who dared to be so careless would have died without bones.You're just saying it to make everyone think that you trust everyone.In fact, Li Hao had taken precautions against many people, such as Dao Jian, Qian Wuliang, and some new martial Saints. The current arrangement was that several Dao integration realm Saints from each city would be in charge of the city, and no powerful figures would be released.After Ying Hongyue's death, the seal was completely suppressed by the eight major cities.Once something went wrong ... It was very likely that the seal would break. Li Hao felt that Zheng Yu and Li daoheng had more plans and did not have much to do with the red moon Emperor, so they would not deliberately release the venerable Emperor's true body ... Otherwise, these people would not be safe.Fortunately, Li Hao, Zheng Yu, and Li daoheng still had the same goal for now. They could send out half-step sovereigns, but not venerable sovereigns.Therefore, even if these two people had pawns, Li Hao could be somewhat at ease, which was why he didn't look into it.Li Hao didn't know if there were any among them ... Or if they were deliberately creating a sense of danger for him. However, he kept some core information rather hidden and rarely told these people.After patrolling the seven main cities, the experts were very calm. They were all in closed-door cultivation or comprehending new DAOs.These people also knew almost nothing about the change of master of the great Dao.In fact, Li Hao's spiritual world still kept the Dao meridian stars of a few people, just in case they attacked the great Dao universe. Even if the great Dao changed owners, he did not return them. He was mainly afraid that Hong Yitang would be too careless and get attacked by these guys.……Above the Silver City, under the seal.Li Hao didn't try to hide anything from them, as if he were just having a normal training session. At this moment, he was sitting cross-legged in the air, thinking about something.The world of his spirit sea continued to roll.The energy from all directions started to gather around him.In the city, someone raised his head to take a look, but he didn't pay much attention to it. Li Hao's cultivation always caused a big commotion.This time, no one was informed in advance, so they didn't pay much attention.Currently, the enemies were all in the void Dao universe, so Silver Moon was actually very safe. Even though there was half-Emperor Tian Ji in the North, Heavenly King expert Tian Ji in the West, and heaven's will hidden in the dark, Silver Moon was still safe.But apart from the one in the North, none of them posed much of a threat to Li Hao.In the distance, Zhang an took a few more glances.Recently, he was also at a critical moment, the moment when he officially became a Heavenly King ... The Heavenly King that he pursued was not as simple as the king of Dali or the Queen. Otherwise, he would have been able to advance a long time ago.What Zhang an pursued was the fusion of the two DAOs of origin and bright star. A book of great Dao could contain everything and integrate the results of the two DAOs.As the grandson of a Supreme Being, it was actually a very embarrassing thing for him to still be a prospective Heavenly King.Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and the others were all considered his juniors.Her status was inferior to his.But now, these people were half-step sovereigns and dominated the entire Silver Moon.In the past few days, he had been constantly comprehending new DAOs and integrating the origin Dao at the same time.In the air, Li Hao continued to absorb the power from all directions. Countless energy stones were instantly shattered. They were all taken from Hurricane city. A large number of energy stones were shattered, turning the small silver City into a Holy Land where energy rain could fall.The seal in the sky seemed to have sensed something as well, and it glowed slightly.Although the seal was suppressed by the eight major cities and was not much weaker than before, the formation had indeed been broken. The remaining formation was not as good as before.Just as Li Hao was cultivating, a weak Crimson Moon Power seeped out.Just like that year!There was even a light drizzle in the sky, just like the rainy season in Silver City.In the past, during the rainy season, stripping away the bloodlines of the eight great families was something that Ying Hongyue often did, and it was also related to the power of the Crimson Moon.On this day, Li Hao was cultivating when the rain started again.It scattered all over the Silver City!In the void, the raindrops mixed with red power seemed to have gathered into a human face. It didn't have any offensive power, but the venerable sovereign seemed to be too idle and wanted to come out for a breath of air.

Li Hao, on the other hand, could be easily destroyed.But Li Hao didn't destroy it.He allowed the rain to gather. Gradually, the rain became heavier and heavier. A human face had already formed."Li Hao!"The majestic voice rang in his ears. Li Hao operated his spiritual world, and the stars in his world were constantly exuding vitality. He opened his eyes and looked at the big face, which was much bigger than his entire body.He just watched silently.Seeing that Li Hao did not destroy his projection, Red Moon Thearch laughed."If the world is divided into four parts today, you will be the weakest, while those two guys are quite strong. Have you considered cooperating with me?""Do you sell rat poison?"“……”Red Moon sovereign was stunned. What did he mean?"Selling yourself to everyone you see? are venerable sovereigns so worthless?"Li Hao's tone was calm,'you must have promoted yourself a lot in the virtual Dao universe, right? You promote to everyone you see, you ... How did you survive as a venerable sovereign? These are the only words you say when you meet? You don't have any constructive opinions and only know how to talk about cooperation?"Red Moon sovereign frowned slightly and was a little unhappy.Li Hao was still calm,"if you want to cooperate, what can you pay?" Do you have a more practical one? Do you think I'm stupid, Zheng Yu is stupid, or li daoheng is stupid? Which of us three isn't smarter than you?"Red Moon sovereign was a little angry!Li Hao smiled."Alright, I'm too free, and so are you ... That's why I let you out for a chat. I thought that you might be able to talk about something useful, but in the end ... You can't do anything except lie. The key is that you're not sincere in your lies at all."Red Moon sovereign frowned and looked at him,"do I need to fool you?" Wasn't this Emperor telling the truth? What qualifications do you have to compete with the two of them? Be it Zheng Yu or li daoheng, they were not simple! Don't look down on him just because he's a pseudo-Emperor ... He has the heart of a whale swallowing the world! If necessary ... There's a high chance of him becoming a venerable sovereign!"Li Hao was curious."Now that I've proven my Dao and become an Emperor, do I have to face the great trial of a venerable sovereign?"The universe of origin had already disappeared. Was there a need to?If he didn't need it, would he become an Emperor immediately?He was very curious about this. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Red Moon sovereign pondered for a while and replied,"it's hard to say." The origin had disappeared, the new martial arts had disappeared, and the great Tribulation of the venerable sovereigns might have also disappeared! Of course, new martial's venerable sovereign tribulation was man-made by the human King and the others ... These two could reach the half-step sovereign realm, and they had always been cultivating the origin ... It did not mean that they did not have a venerable sovereign tribulation! If there really is a great sovereign tribulation, it might come from outside the Stargate and even destroy it ... That's why these two guys don't dare to cross the Tribulation so easily, in case I break the seal. "Li Hao was deep in thought."So, the great calamity of venerable sovereigns might still exist?""Yes,""You finally gave me a good answer," Li Hao said with a smile. Red Moon sovereign was speechless."Crimson Moon universe," Li Hao said."Why are you conquering neo martial? neo martial isn't weak.""You don't understand!"Red Moon sovereign was a little arrogant."There are countless worlds in the universe ... Devouring chaos can strengthen a world. However, devouring a world can be successful in one try. It's equivalent to hundreds of millions of years of breathing!" "Our Crimson Moon universe is unparalleled in power. After countless years, the surrounding worlds have all been destroyed! Big fish eats small fish everywhere ... The stronger the neo martial art, the better. Once the neo martial art is swallowed, the Crimson Moon universe will naturally be stronger!""Cultivation is for the sake of constantly annexing?"Li Hao looked at him."You're from a major world. Can't you find another way out?" he asked."Why do we need to find another way out? This was the fastest, easiest, and most direct method! Even if 100000 years have passed in the outside world, it's worth it to conquer a world in 100000 years!"Red Moon sovereign did not think that there was anything wrong with it. He only felt that Li Hao did not understand.He wasn't interested in explaining this to Li Hao, so he said again,""Your own cultivation is too slow. Even if you control the truth Dao universe, it'll be very difficult to advance to the half-step sovereign realm! Li Hao, cooperate with me ..."Just as he said that, he suddenly felt that something was wrong.There was more and more energy in the surroundings.Not only that, even ... The power of the Crimson Moon that seeped out of him was absorbed by this guy. He frowned slightly."You really don't mind eating meat or vegetables!"You dare to swallow my Crimson Moon Power?The seal was no longer the same as before.If you swallow too much, be careful that I will directly project it out and kill you!Li Hao didn't care. He sensed the power of the Crimson Moon and said,""Is the power of the Crimson Moon based on desire?""Desire?"Red Moon sovereign laughed,"I guess so." If a cultivator had no desires in his life, do you think he would still have motivation? You don't know how terrifying it is to lose all desire after living for too long!""Countless worlds have decayed like this!"The red moon sovereign sighed,"in the past, the red moon world attacked a universe, and the world Master of that world was extremely powerful ... However, at the last moment, he allowed the red moon to devour him. Why?" He had lived for too long! It was so long ago that the other party felt that there was no difference whether he was Dead or Alive! Only I, Red Moon, am still full of energy after so many years!"Li Hao was stunned for a moment, but then he nodded. It made sense.He had lived for too long! To a world Lord, they might be able to live for millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of years.The world changed again and again, and civilization recovered again and again ... In the end, perhaps he was the only one left in the world, and he felt endless loneliness.At that time, if he had no desire at all, it seemed normal to commit suicide and beg for death.

2432 Chapter 406
What I'm afraid of is that no one can kill you.The Crimson Moon world had existed for countless years and still had the desire to attack. It was indeed very rare."Is your Dao the same?"Li Hao asked again. Red Moon Emperor looked around and frowned.What was the point of Li Hao absorbing so much energy?Hearing Li Hao's question, he sneered,""This is a high-level world, understand?""Understand what?""The Dao ultimately becomes one! There were too many fancy things, and that was the initial stage! In the later stages, the myriad DAOs become one ... That is the final form of the world!"Li Hao's heart moved, and he nodded, that makes sense! In other words, in the world of the Crimson Moon, all the DAOs have become one, so all those who come later will cultivate the same Dao?""Of course!""Huh?" Li Hao was a little confused."Then ... Doesn't that mean that the later generations have no hope of surpassing the predecessors?"Red Moon sovereign was stunned and looked at him,""Why do you want to surpass your predecessors? Could it be that the predecessors were not human? The predecessors opened the sky, and the future generations enjoy the benefits. They can just accept it, but do you want to rebel?"Li Hao was stunned.After a long time, he slowly said,"therefore, when the great Dao is unified, it will eventually lose its creativity. The latecomers will never be as good as the predecessors. The classes will be completely solidified! A World Master will always be a World Master, and a venerable sovereign will always be a venerable sovereign ... There's almost no hope for the future generations to surpass them?""Also not!"Red Moon sovereign shook his head and said,"I'll have the chance to invade the great world and make a name for myself!" This is also the reason why we have been waging war. Just as you said, we can't give the latecomers no hope ... Our world Lords wouldn't be so unwise as to start wars ... Every time they succeed in their invasion, some top-tier powerhouses will be born!"Li Hao's heart moved again. This was a good idea."If the social class is solidified, there's no way to suppress internal conflicts. Then we'll use external Wars to resolve such conflicts. If the future generations don't have an opportunity ... I'll create an opportunity for you.War!Endless battles!The premise was that they had to be strong enough and not be a warmonger. Red Moon obviously had such strength that even the extremely powerful neo martial artists were not her opponent."Neo martial doesn't seem to have been around for a long time ... From what you're saying, neo martial doesn't seem to be weak in the major universes?"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Red Moon sovereign was looking around. The more he looked, the more confused he became. The commotion seemed to be getting bigger. The conversation with Li Hao was not confidential, so he casually said,""New martial arts are replaced quickly, and each generation is stronger than the previous. The speed at which the later generations overthrow the predecessors is too fast ... This leads to the upper limit of combat power rising continuously! "Logically speaking, it's normal for the initial stage of neo martial arts to last for hundreds of thousands or millions of years. As a result, they quickly transitioned to the origin era. In the end, it didn't last long before it was quickly overpowered by neo martial arts ... This led to the upper limit of combat power rising crazily. Therefore, they're not considered weak in the major worlds."Li Hao, however, was puzzled."Logically speaking, the world is a seed. The seed is young and can not absorb much chaotic energy. The world is a fixed energy. How can it surpass the Crimson Moon?""I'm not overtaking!"Red Moon sovereign was dissatisfied!"Although neo martial is strong, it's still not as good as my Crimson Moon world! There were many reasons why Red Moon couldn't take down new martial quickly. In addition ..."When he said this, he sneered."Don't think that the neo martial human King and the others are good people. They say that they only seek self-protection. The sun god of neo martial travels all over the world. Do you think it's really just traveling the universe? What a joke! When that person entered a universe, many times, he would devour a large amount of world power and take it away ... Not only him, but many experts of the new martial arts world had also wandered in the universe! "Because neo martial has two world Lords, one of whom can endure loneliness, the neo martial human King is not afraid of the other party's rebellion, so he himself has been out a lot ..."Li Hao's heart moved."You mean, neo martial has also secretly annexed some worlds?" he asked."It's not annexing!"Red Moon sovereign shook his head and said,"I'm a bandit ... I'll enter a universe in the name of traveling, but in fact, I'll devour the energy of the universe!" They say they won't take the initiative to attack, but they've done a lot of dirty things in the dark ... Otherwise, do you think neo martial can grow so quickly?"Li Hao touched his chin and said,"I don't think so.""Hehe!"Red Moon sovereign sneered,"let's put it this way ... These people are very good at fishing! "We can send anyone to travel around the world. Once they are stopped or killed ... Very soon, people like the neo martial human King, Supreme martial artist, and sun god will quickly arrive. They will either pay with their lives or ... Their energy!""Many worlds, which were not far from the neo martial world, fled! Why? It was because neo martial was too overbearing! If my Crimson Moon cosmos wasn't so powerful, the sun god would have absorbed countless amounts of energy and taken it away!"Was it?It sounded like new martial arts was the one who took the initiative to find trouble.However, he had heard the human King say that they did not cause trouble, but they were not afraid of trouble. If you wanted to kill me, I would kill you ...The two versions were quite different.Moreover, neo martial had only been around for a short time, probably just a thousand years. After that, they lost contact with neo martial and silver Moon became independent."Didn't they say that it's very difficult to locate someone in the primordial chaos? Once I leave, I might not be able to return for many years ...""That's true, but top-notch experts won't go missing so easily ... But neo martial human Kings ..."He sneered."He went out a few times and used the excuse that he was lost. He broke into some big worlds and asked people to show him the way. In the end, conflicts often broke out. What a ridiculous excuse! As the master of a world, would he get lost? What a laughable excuse!"

2433 Chapter 406
Li Hao touched his chin again."It's hard to say. I've read in some books that the neo martial King ... Indeed lacks a sense of direction. He's been lost since he was weak. Could he really be lost and just wanted to ask for directions ... And you misunderstood?"Red Moon sovereign scoffed and did not take it seriously.Who are you trying to fool!Being the master of a world, the chaos was indeed very complicated. However, it was easy to get lost and not be able to find one's own universe. Who would believe that one could find someone else's home?The two of them continued to chat."What are you doing?" Red Moon sovereign suddenly asked in a deep voice.The energy in the surroundings began to gather toward Li Hao like a tornado.An energy storm formed above Li Hao's head, sweeping across the world.This was still considered ordinary cultivation?Even a half-step sovereign wouldn't be able to create such a huge commotion, right?What was he doing?Li Hao smiled,"it's nothing. I'm just training." It's just that the movement is a Little Big ... The venerable sovereign doesn't mind, right? By the way, if I may ask, the venerable sovereign clone is formed by the power of the Crimson Moon. Why hasn't he been struck to death after entering the void Dao universe for so many days?"'Could it be that there is no great Dao lightning in the void Dao universe?'Red Moon sovereign was not in the mood to pay attention to him. At this moment, he was looking around with some doubts in his eyes. Then, he looked at the sky and saw that the seal formed by the eight cities was also shaking.What was this person up to now?Seeing that he was ignoring him, Li Hao suddenly turned hostile.""I asked you a question, but you didn't answer. What do I need you for?"BOOM!With a palm strike, this projection that didn't have much strength was instantly shattered.The speed at which they turned hostile was unimaginable!Red Moon sovereign's virtual image shattered instantly with some anger and annoyance. This bastard had just smashed it without even saying a word. Also, what was he doing?……Li Hao wasn't in the mood to chat with him.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At that moment, his spiritual world fluctuated violently, and the stars began to tremble. In his body, the Dao meridian stars also trembled violently as they began to merge!At this moment, a star slowly emerged from Li Hao's body and instantly turned into a giant dragon.The giant dragon circled!The giant dragon instantly entered the world of his spirit sea through his glabella.……In the seven main cities.Some of them saw it but did not understand it. Some of them knew something, such as Lin Hongyu, and they suddenly became nervous.……In his spirit sea.The giant dragon entered and began to soar. In an instant, the entire spirit Sea World began to roll violently.The heavens and earth were turned upside down!The 180 stars trembled violently. The Dragon seemed to be looking for a suitable star to merge with. Suddenly, it locked onto a star and flew toward it.The huge Dragon instantly entered ... BOOM!At this moment, it was as if the sky and earth were falling apart. The entire spirit Sea World trembled madly. Countless spiritual power, blood Qi power, new Dao power, and Shi power were all stirred up!The combination of reality and illusion seemed to be a huge change!The whole world seemed to be shaking. This was only the first Star. Moreover, Li Hao's virtual Dao and real Dao were not in the real universe of the great path. One could imagine how terrifying the real universe of the great path was when the virtual Dao and the real Dao were combined. The great Dao of heaven and earth seemed to have changed at this moment.The entire Silver Moon seemed to have been affected.Li Hao's choice was to create a physical world in the world, but it also posed a threat to the world.BOOM!In the air, countless Thunderbolts seemed to gather.In a distant place, it seemed as if heaven's will had started to roll.……At this moment, there was some movement in all directions.In the void Dao universe.Suddenly, the void Dao universe trembled. At the next moment, li daoheng's voice sounded with some confusion and anger.""Who's shaking the universe!"In an instant, two human figures appeared.Zheng Yu looked around. At this moment, there seemed to be some changes happening in the entire void Dao universe. It trembled slightly, but the commotion was not big. However, this was the great Dao universe. If there were no special circumstances, why would there be a riot?He frowned slightly but did not say anything.The red moon Emperor's clone also appeared quickly. He did not say a word and only thought about something silently.……In the reality Dao universe.The long river rippled, and a person appeared. He looked into the distance and saw a star. It seemed to have appeared, but it didn't seem to be too deep, and the movement wasn't too great. It appeared for an instant and then disappeared again.……Li Dynasty.Heaven's Fate looked into the distance and frowned slightly. He cursed in his heart. What is he doing now?He looked at the king of Dali, who was not far away. At this moment, the king of Dali was waving his fists as if he was ready to do something. He had to open his mouth and said in a low voice,""Beiwu, what are you doing?""Cultivate!" The king of Dali said without turning his head.Refine my ass!You think you're cultivating just because you're punching?"You met Li Hao before. Did he say how to deal with those guys?" he asked."I've said, we'll deal with it as soldiers come, water comes, earth comes!"Nonsense!Heaven's Fate didn't ask him any more questions, but he kept looking in the direction of the Silver City with some suspicion. With such a big commotion, couldn't he be quiet for a few days?Again and again, can't you keep quiet!……A star fused with a Dragon.The commotion was huge!Li Hao didn't expect that the fusion of two stars would cause such a huge chain reaction. More importantly ... Where did the lightning come from?At this moment, dark clouds covered the sky.Li Hao couldn't understand why the enormous lightning bolts were gathering.What did I do?The lightning in this world was either formed by heaven's will or the great Dao.

The heavens dare to provoke me?The lightning of the great path had overflowed outside?Is this the rhythm of the great Dao trying to kill me?Strange!Or could it be that this Thunderbolt came out of nowhere?With countless doubts, he looked up at the sky and frowned slightly. I didn't expect that lightning would be born.In the distance, Zhang an muttered,""Venerable sovereign's great Tribulation?"Why did it look like the Great Tribulation of a venerable sovereign?It's not that bad!Putting aside the fact that there was no venerable sovereign tribulation in the Silver Moon, even if there was, it would not be Li Hao's turn ... Of course, the lightning did not seem to be strong, unlike the venerable sovereign tribulation, where countless bolts of lightning appeared in an instant, and any one of them could kill Heavenly Kings.But this time ... It seemed to be just the beginning!What was Li Hao doing?He found that he could no longer see through Li Hao.Lightning began to gather, but it did not fall. Dark clouds covered the sun, making people a little flustered.Li Hao ignored him and continued to merge his Dao Meridian.Another giant dragon flew out and burrowed into his mind. It began to search for the next Star to merge with. And at this moment, the number of Thunderbolts increased.These Thunderbolts were not formed by heaven's will.……At the same time.Within the seal.Red Moon sovereign's expression changed slightly. The gate of the Blood Moon above his head, the gate with dazzling Starlight, seemed to be penetrated by something at this moment. The power of Thunderbolts mixed with some chaos poured in from the outside!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ His heart trembled violently, and without thinking, he flew straight up into the sky!The Stargate is open?Then, can I break the seal, leave through the Stargate, recover some strength, and return to break the seal?Just as he collided with it ... BOOM!The lightning exploded above him. Below him, the seal trembled. Above him, the Stargate flickered with radiance and blocked him. It even erupted with extremely powerful world-destroying lightning!BOOM!Red Moon sovereign was a little angry as his skin and flesh were torn."Why?" Why was there an influx of power, but he couldn't get out?Why?Also, this power...The power of lightning, why did it suddenly enter the Silver Moon world from the outside world, who caused it?Venerable sovereign's tribulation?How could this be!Neither Zheng Yu nor li daoheng had become venerable sovereigns, and Li Hao ... He had just seen that Li Hao was only at the fifth level of the Dao integration realm, which was far from being a venerable sovereign!He could only watch helplessly as the energy seeped through the seal and fell down."Li Hao ..."He mumbled to himself in confusion and shock. What had Li Hao done to cause the power of lightning to surge in? was he trying to kill Li Hao? There was a lightning tribulation in the chaos!This, he knew.However, he had never seen it before. It was said that lightning tribulations existed in the chaos and would often be triggered by some top-notch existences. As for why it would appear, he had yet to come into contact with that level.It was possible that comprehending the Dao had caused the chaos to resonate.Perhaps he had done something outrageous, and even chaos could not stand it.There could also be other reasons ...However, Li Hao was in Silver Moon. What could he do?The Silver Moon was a sealed small world.Of course, the power of the Thunderbolts at this moment was very weak. Red Moon sovereign sensed that the Thunderbolts that poured in were very, very weak. If they seeped in, they would be even weaker. At most, they could kill a Saint. That was an overestimation."Strange!"However, gradually, the power of the Thunderbolts became more and more intense. It began to penetrate and strengthen.……Below, Li Hao kept merging the stars.One, two, three ...The aura on his body also gradually began to mix and become stronger.The dark clouds above his head grew larger and larger. Li Hao's heart stirred. Suddenly, the wind and cloud treasure mirror appeared in front of him and opened the sky again."Citizens of the haoxing continent, there's no need to be nervous! "The last time the great Dao universe descended, it failed ... This time, I want the great Dao universe to devour the bright star continent. Since I can't descend, I'll take the initiative to enter and devour the world! It will allow billions of cultivators to gain enlightenment of the Dao at close range ..."At first, the dark clouds had been spreading and the world had been shaking. Everyone had been confused and guessed that Li Hao had done something.At this moment, when they heard his words, they felt at ease.So that was how it was!Since you're not coming, I'll go.Devouring the bright star continent?Can I?Who knows!At this moment, the great Dao universe instantly split open. A long river rippled in the great Dao universe, and Li Hao's voice rose again. "Don't worry, the river has merged with the heavens and earth. I'll try to devour the Silvermoon world so that all of the Silvermoon people will become Daoist! The people of the great Dao! The will of the heavens, half-step sovereigns, venerable sovereigns, none of them will be able to disturb my Silver Moon citizens!"In the void, the lightning was getting more and more intense.Li Hao's voice rose again."It seems that the heavens and the world can't tolerate it. The world can't allow me to devour Silver Moon ... But I, Li Hao, must be the one to defy the heavens!"His cold voice reverberated through the heavens and earth.It was shocking and extremely shocking.Was heaven and earth intolerable?The great Dao's descent failed, and Li Hao turned around and wanted to Annex the world?At this moment, in the distance, a moon appeared. The next moment, another one appeared. Two moons in total. One was the Queen, and the other was the moon god who had survived a few times. At this moment, they were both shocked.Li Hao was going to devour the world?Damn it!Even the Queen could sense that if the great Dao swallowed the Silvermoon world ... The core of the Silvermoon land, Silvermoon herself, would be severely injured!In the distance, there seemed to be heaven's will rumbling!

Heaven's will was built on the foundation of the heaven and earth. Once the heaven and earth were swallowed, a huge hole would be left behind. Without people, even if heaven's will still existed, would it still be called heaven's will?He was taking drastic measures!Li Hao, that bastard!How detestable!In addition to the Thunderbolts above Silver City, everyone believed it at this moment. There was no way they wouldn't believe it. Such a huge commotion was most likely to be caused by a real attempt to swallow the entire Silver Moon province. The thunderclouds were almost spreading across the entire Silver Moon province. It was extremely terrifying.And Li Hao's aura was getting stronger!At this moment, he had transformed into a giant.Streams of Primal Chaos energy overflowed from his body, and Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell.""Li daoheng, Zheng Yu, heaven's will ... I don't care what you do. I only want the truth Dao universe, I only want this bright star continent!""The people I'm taking away ... Will live, grow old, get sick, and die in the great Dao universe! Whether it's time, stars, or the Silver Moon world ... They're all yours. I'll seal the great Dao universe after swallowing the Hao Xing continent. From then on, you can fight your own battles ... And we'll mind our own business!"Li Hao was very sincere!"Don't try to stop me," the voice rang out again."Once you do, I'll break the seal and let the venerable sovereign take action!" Red Moon sovereign, I only want a continent and the truth Dao universe. It has nothing to do with you!"At this moment, the void Dao universe was slowly splitting apart.Three figures appeared but didn't walk out.Red Moon sovereign's voice resounded through heaven and earth. He said with a smile,"Do as you please!"Li Hao was going to swallow the world?To him ... There was indeed no loss. However, if it really succeeded, Zheng Yu and Li daoheng would not be happy. Even the will of heaven would not agree.This guy always liked to make new moves!This time, it was especially big.However, he was still a little suspicious. He looked at the huge dark clouds and the flashing lightning and frowned slightly.Would annexing the world bring about a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?As a venerable sovereign, even if it was just an avatar, his eyesight would not be too bad. This should be the Thunder tribulation that seeped from the chaos. Although it was not the Great Tribulation of a venerable sovereign of new martial arts, its power was not weak.Could it be that the universe of the great path devoured the heaven and earth, something that the heaven and earth and chaos could not tolerate?It was slightly strange!However, at this moment, there seemed to be only one explanation for such a huge commotion. The chaos did not allow it, the great Dao did not allow it, and heaven and earth did not allow it!Annexing Silver Moon was not allowed!Another star fused, and heaven and earth trembled even more.In fact, there were even some faint screams, which were the screams of the Heaven's Will.No!At the same time, the void Dao universe seemed to be getting closer and closer to the earth, as if it was about to fall into the mortal world.The man with the sword on his back said coldly.Devour the world?How could that be!More importantly ... It seemed like it was Devouring The Heavens and earth, but why did it feel so different?In the distance, the enormous Li Hao exuded a faint chaotic force, which seemed to be slightly different from the power of the river of Dao.At this moment, Li Hao's star fusion rate increased again. BOOM!In the sky, the Thunder became more and more powerful. Vaguely, it was already somewhat restless, and was about to descend on the human world!"Is he ... Really devouring the world?" the sword-bearing man suddenly asked. It didn't look like it!Zheng Yu also looked on silently, his eyes flickering.""How long more?""Half an hour!"The man with the sword on his back said softly,"I'm more worried that the Thunderbolts are getting stronger ... Will they break through the Stargate?" This tribulation lightning seems to be from the outside and not from the inside of the Silver Moon!"After saying that, he looked around, as if he was looking at something.Tianyi ... Probably couldn't sit still anymore!If Li Hao really settled it, then heaven's will was finished.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Why don't we let Tianyi go and take a look first ..." Zheng Yu suddenly said."You can control heaven's will?""I'm talking about you!""Ha!"The two of them had a conversation.At that moment, a figure appeared in the distance and kept approaching Li Hao. He stopped in Li Hao's direction and stood in the central mainland. He shouted coldly,""Li Hao, stop! If you really want to devour the stellarsky continent, I will kill all the humans in this world!"A powerful force swept out in all directions. Heaven's will was rolling!It seemed to be roaring!At this moment, in the seven main cities, someone's eyes flickered and he said in a low voice,""It's really him!"The ninth Prince of heavenstar!The young prince, the disciple of the southern style, and the guy who had almost fallen out with the Silver Moon Martial Master for him.In the air, Li Hao seemed to be very calm.The ninth Prince?He looked into the distance and smiled."Don't learn the good. Learn the bad!"In the distance, the ninth Prince's aura was powerful, and he also had the power of the Dao integration."Li Hao! Heavenstar is my Jiang family 's, not yours! It's one thing for you to delude people's hearts, but now you're going to die with ten billion humans! The great Dao universe was barren. Once the stellarsky continent entered, countless people would die! You're really vicious. In order to perfect your own great Dao, you're going to kill billions of people?"At this moment, the world was a little shaken.The ninth Prince's voice rang out again,"citizens of Heavenly Star, I am a member of the imperial family!" Li Hao's treachery had angered the heavens and the people, and this lightning was the Tribulation that was going to destroy him! He is where he is today because of everyone's faith. As long as you stop your faith, Li Hao will not succeed ... He took us into the Dao universe, which is a Dao domain without any life. At least 90% of the people in this world will die!"As soon as these words were spoken, the entire continent was slightly shaken.At this moment, Li Hao said calmly,"the Jiang family is rotten to the core. For the sake of martial uncle Nanquan, I spared your life. You still dare to collude with heaven's will to cause trouble. Do you think that I, Li Hao, can't kill you?"The ninth Prince gritted his teeth,"even if I die, I will expose your true colors!" Li Hao, you've gone crazy for your Dao vindication! Do you dare to say that no one will die from annexing the world? You're seeking your own destruction! If you devour the world, you might even attract a few half-emperors and venerable sovereigns ... Li Hao, as long as you die and the world is at peace, these experts won't lay their hands on ordinary people!"He looked up at the top powerhouses and said,""Senior Zheng, senior li ... Everyone, do you have the intention to annihilate the world?"Zheng Yu laughed softly, and his voice reverberated through the world.""Why would I? If he wanted to kill, he would have already destroyed the world. What was the point of killing ordinary people? Whoever controlled the world also needed to be an ordinary person. Otherwise, would the world still be the world? The world will no longer be a world!""Did you hear that?"The ninth Prince's voice was loud and shook the heavens."Li Hao, you demon! For the sake of your own selfishness, you've disregarded the lives of the billions of people in the world ... How can you still have the face to control the myriad DAOs of the world?"The Heaven's Will trembled and even swept through the heavens and earth, affecting the hearts of the people.This was something that Tianyi was very good at.Li Hao just watched in silence.The ninth Prince ... Was probably not the only one.How interesting!

Chapter 2436 Great Wisdom Appears To Be Slow-Witted?
Li Hao was like an ancient giant.At this moment, the ninth Prince smiled as he looked at the ninth Prince from the top of the Silver City.They kept saying that Li Hao was an evil person and a sinner.He would bring the world to death!It had to be said that he was smarter than others to criticize Li Hao from the moral high ground. He hoped to use such a method to force Li Hao to give up on devouring the world.However, things had already come to this, so how could it be changed with just a few words?"I spared your life that day because of uncle-Master Nan Quan, but you didn't know how to be grateful. Instead, you colluded with heaven's will, created chaos, and deluded people's hearts. Your crime is unforgivable!""Now, martial uncle Nanquan is dead ... You should go and accompany him!"Li Hao's voice was calm.In the distance, the ninth Prince's expression changed slightly. He gritted his teeth and shouted,""Li Hao! Colluding with heaven's will? What a joke! This world was originally controlled by the will of the heavens. Those who obeyed the heavens would prosper, and those who defied the heavens would perish! You're the one who defied the heavens!""As for He Yong ..."The ninth Prince gritted his teeth."The world belongs to the Jiang family. We've raised him for 20 years, but he's ungrateful and wants to eat his master. Li Hao, don't you think you're being ridiculous?"He didn't dare to get close to Li Hao. Seeing that Li Hao was coming, he gritted his teeth and shouted,""If you dare to come here, I'll sink the entire Heavenly Star continent. I won't let you, Li Hao, lead them to death!"Li Hao smiled."This is interesting ... I'm bringing everyone to the world of the great path, which means I'm going to die. You're threatening me with the lives of the people, but you're the one who's just. This logic is all on your side. I ask the world, are you willing to die with the ninth Prince?""I'm not willing!"The mountains roared and the seas crashed, and the heavens and earth cracked!At this moment, a landslide-like howl suddenly sounded.This was no longer the same as before.It's been more than a year since the founding of the People's wisdom!Wipe out the literacy of the people, learn knowledge, learn martial arts, and the world will prosper!This wasn't what the ninth Prince had imagined!At this moment, his status as the Prince of the Jiang family wasn't even worth mentioning. At this moment, countless people roared,""Kill the remnants of the feudal system!""Kill the remaining Jiang family members!""Down with feudalism!"“……”A tsunami-like roar resounded through the world.I thought it was back then?Did they still think that the Jiang family was still ruling the country?The heavens had changed long ago!At this moment, there were tens of thousands of supers near the ninth Prince. They all held weapons and charged at him."Kill the villainous disciple and return me my universe!"The ninth Prince's expression changed. The world had really changed.The Jiang family raised their arms and shouted. The era of the world surging was long over.Moreover, after the era of the nine divisions, the Jiang family ... No longer had any prestige to speak of.This year's change was even comparable to the changes in the past hundred years.The ninth Prince still wanted to use such a method to control people's hearts. It was too outdated. At this moment, the entire sky was facing him, showing his terrified face to everyone.One look ... What was this?  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, Li Hao's cold voice resounded through the world.""I don't want to kill them all. The Silver Moon Martial master's rules state that he should leave behind some inheritance. However, since you don't follow the rules of the martial world ... And even insulted our ancestors, you deserve to be executed today!"The ninth Prince's expression changed as he gritted his teeth.""You dare! Li Hao, let me tell you, do you really think I didn't do anything these days? The Jiang family has been storing countless super bombs for so many years. Right now, they are all over the stellarsky continent. If you dare to kill me and they explode at the same time, the entire stellarsky continent will sink!""You really think I don't know the consequences?""If you dare to kill me, countless people will die with me. The continent will explode, and all the people will die together. If We Must Die, we will die together!"He roared loudly. Since he dared to come out, he naturally had some confidence.Was he afraid of death?He was afraid!He knew that Li Hao was very powerful, and that even the blessing of heaven's will couldn't kill him!Therefore, he also knew that this might be the way to restrain Li Hao. If you kill me, I'll blow up the stellarsky continent!Li Hao turned to look at the Saints in the big cities, some of whom turned pale.If the ninth Prince had really been planted with countless super bombs ... Everyone present would have failed their duty. No one knew about such a big matter, and Li Hao had long since sent people to keep an eye on the ninth Prince.The other party had still buried countless explosives underground without anyone knowing ... Lin Hongyu and the others had all failed in their duties!In the distance, the ninth Prince revealed a look of joy.He was excited!The people help you cultivate, but you, Li Hao, also have a weakness. You are also restricted by the people.Li Hao actually wanted to say ... You're done, but on second thought, forget it. I'm sorry, senior uncle Hong. Especially now, senior uncle Hong's relationship with the people is getting closer and closer, and it's even more dangerous.If he really went all out and killed Silver Moon, the river of Dao might collapse. This had both advantages and disadvantages.At this moment, lightning was gathering above his head. In his spirit sea, the stars were still merging. The merging was not complete. Or rather, it was just the beginning.The crucial part was not here yet.A mere clown threatening him ... What a joke.These were just pawns that each party used to see their own methods."I'm sorry ..."Li Hao sighed softly."When I first met you in the past, you were still quite elegant. When the Jiang family was destroyed, I spared your life because I saw that you didn't do too many evil things. I didn't expect that you didn't cherish it and got involved with that bullsh * t heaven's will ..."

"Then ... I'll fulfill your wish!" Li Hao said with a brilliant smile.At this moment, a long river of chaos appeared. Li Hao instantly appeared above the river and flowed along it before disappearing.The ninth Prince's expression changed dramatically, and he roared,""If you dare ... If you come any closer, I'll immediately detonate all the bombs!"At this moment, he had the power of a Saint.However, he knew that Li Hao was too terrifying. So what if he was a Saint?In front of Li Hao, what use was a Heavenly King?Seeing that Li Hao didn't care about it, he gritted his teeth and flew toward the moon in the sky. It was the moon goddess. Not only that, but at this moment, energy fluctuations seemed to be coming from all over the world.A crazed look appeared in his eyes,""You forced me to do this! Li Hao, you shameless man, you really don't care about these people's lives. Since that's the case ... Blow them up!"At this moment, he chose to ignite and detonate!Li Hao, you've forced me!As for him, he went straight to the moon goddess and escaped to her side. He would Enter the Void Dao universe at the crucial moment so that he would not be killed by Li Hao.At least for now ... There was still a basis for cooperation."I'm going to break your 10000 DAOs!"The ninth Prince became even crazier, and countless bombs started to explode from all directions!Everyone in the world was shocked.How many explosives had this man buried?How many people were going to die this time?At this moment, a different River suddenly appeared at the end of the river of chaos. It spread out and instantly surrounded the ninth Prince. Time seemed to reverse!The ninth Prince was charging into the sky, but he suddenly felt his vision blur. In the next instant, he felt like he had returned to where he was.What was happening?In all directions, the explosions suddenly disappeared, as if nothing had happened. At this moment, Li Hao walked out from the end of the river and grabbed him with one hand!Heaven's will instantly shook and the space trembled. The ninth Prince instantly woke up, but heaven's will instantly fled!Terrifying!Li Hao didn't pay attention to Tianyi. Instead, he reached out to grab the ninth Prince.,m Kachaa!With his head grabbed by Li Hao, the ninth Prince's face was filled with fear."What did you do to me?"Li Hao sighed."It's a pity for uncle-master Nanquan's kind intentions. I'm sorry, uncle-master Nanquan!"It wasn't because of this person, but because of the southern Fist. Kachaa!BOOM!Their heads exploded and their bodies were crushed into dust. Countless energies scattered in all directions and flew toward the ordinary cultivators who were charging at them. Li Hao's voice rang out."This power is bestowed upon you. You deserve a reward!"BOOM!"Arghhh ...!" The explosions continued as the ninth Prince's entire body exploded. A scream of despair and disbelief resounded through the sky.He was killed ... Just like that?  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ ……At the entrance of the void Dao universe.The eyes of the powerhouses changed slightly. Zheng Yu muttered,""This guy really has the ability to control time. He actually ... Reversed time!"Even if it was only for a few seconds!Red Moon sovereign's expression also changed slightly."It's only a small area, but ... It can really reverse time. This is indeed incredible. The so-called control of time is only relative. It stops an area, not reversing it!"The two were completely different!Still meant that only time in one area had stopped. In other areas, time was still moving, which was equivalent to a time stop. However, Li Hao had just retreated in a small area!This meant that Li Hao's control over time was even more terrifying!Although it was only for a short moment ... It was still an incredible result for an expert.The ninth Prince's probing wasn't completely useless. At least they saw Li Hao's hidden cards. This guy was even more terrifying than before.However, Zheng Yu quickly shook his head and said,'it's not a complete reversal! It only covered the ninth Prince and not a large area. It only covered a small area and not a single person! The bomb didn't explode, and there was some karma involved ... No matter what, such a method was already incredible! In the new martial era, no one has mastered time. Why did this new Dao give birth to the power of time?"They didn't care about the ninth Prince's death.A Saint, and a forcefully cultivated Saint at that ... What the hell was that?No one would even bat an eye if a few Heavenly Kings died.Descendants of the royal family and members of the Jiang family ... They were all a joke. In their eyes, the ninth Prince's greatest contribution was to force Li Hao to reveal his hidden tricks!"How long more?"Zheng Yu frowned slightly."It's not very appropriate ... Li Hao actually used the power of time to deal with a nobody. This means ... He might have a bigger secret or a bigger scheme. Li daoheng, use whatever means you have to delay Li Hao!"A nobody!Even if the ninth Prince died, he probably wouldn't have thought that this was the evaluation of these top-tier existences.At this moment, in the distance, the man with the sword on his back frowned slightly.""There's indeed a bigger scheme. I've already noticed that something's wrong! "Li Hao isn't just here to devour the world. Zheng Yu, at this point, there's no need for us to hide anything. Some small tricks might work against the weak, but they won't be of much use to us. Why don't we use them together?"Zheng Yu smiled and nodded," Then let it out ... Don't delay it!"

Chapter 2438 Great Wisdom Appears To Be Foolish?
……At the same time.Floating in the air, the Queen's expression suddenly changed. At this moment, a vast power flowed into her through Silvermoon's body.It was ... A familiar power!It was also the power of the Silver Moon!The moon goddess!As expected!Just as she had guessed, and just as Li Hao had thought, she was just a chess piece in the eyes of the moon goddess, li daoheng, and Li Hao.p No matter how strong he was, he couldn't escape the fate of a chess piece.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Not only that, but at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared near her. The Queen was very familiar with them. She saw a few gods, the Prophet God, misfortune, fate, disaster ...Many Phantom Dao deities!The auras of these godly spirits were all very powerful. They weren't just Saints. These godly spirits had the power of Saints to begin with, and at this moment, they seemed to have recovered to their peak or even further.His aura instantly exploded, and the power of misfortune and disaster filled the world.The Queen's aura instantly transformed into the aura of the moon goddess. Li daoheng's voice rang out,""Slaughter the heaven and earth, kill all the cultivators, and bring disaster to the human world!""Yes!"The gods did not seem to have lost their consciousness. They looked at the Queen who was struggling not far away and started to fly in all directions, trying to bring disaster to the human world.The Queen gritted her teeth and looked to the other side of the sky. She looked at the bright moon. That was where the moon goddess was.However, at this moment, a powerful force was sweeping through the world, threatening and controlling him. He thought that he had control over the power, but it was actually a joke. He had always been a chess piece for these people.Her face turned cold and she gritted her teeth. Her eyes were red. You bastards!Do you really think I don't know anything and am not prepared at all?Do you think you can control this King as you please?At this moment, her physical body was forcefully carrying her toward Li Hao, as if she was using her as a pawn to test Li Hao and delay him. These people didn't expect the Queen to kill Li Hao.The Queen had absorbed a large amount of the Silver Moon's power. At this moment, she was not weaker than a late Heavenly King, not inferior to Li Hao.But whether it was li daoheng, Zheng Yu ... Or even the Queen herself, they all knew that they couldn't rival Li Hao. He was a guy who couldn't be judged solely by his level.The Queen's eyes flickered as she flew toward Li Hao.After a long time, when he was about to get close to Li Hao, his eyes suddenly showed a hint of joy and relief.You guys ... Feel good controlling me, don't you?Not far away, Li Hao was watching silently, as if he was waiting for something.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly frowned. Looking at the Queen ... He was a little confused.A bright moon was suspended in the sky. At this moment, its aura was very powerful. Li daoheng and the others seemed to no longer hide anything, or perhaps they felt that they might not be able to use it in the future. A monstrous power swept across the world. It was not just the power of the Silver Moon.There was also a force that charged straight for his Dao Meridian!The Empress 'Dao Meridian!Li Hao knew where the Queen's physical Dao Meridian was. Furthermore, it was controlled in his spiritual world. At this moment, this force was attacking his spiritual world.Of course, this was within Li Hao's expectations. It wasn't a big deal.However, just as he was about to extinguish this power ...The Queen suddenly smiled. It was not the smile of the moon goddess, but the stupid and self-righteous smile of the Queen. When Li Hao saw this smile ... He felt that something was wrong!Don't tell me ... He's going to scam me again?This woman was doing things step by step according to li daoheng's plan. Li Hao wasn't actually worried about anything. What he was afraid of was ... This guy wasn't just going to set up his teammates, he was going to set up everyone!He really felt that the Queen was a fraud.This was because smart people could know what smart people were thinking, but a not-so-smart person would often do things that no one could predict.At this moment, the Queen sneered,""You're controlling my life? This Wang......Is it that easy to provoke?"Hearing this, Li Hao suddenly felt that it was inappropriate!"Don't be reckless!"He hurriedly shouted.The Queen ignored him. All of a sudden, a monstrous force burst out and a red energy swept across the world. A venerable sovereign who was sealed was slightly stunned.A small hole suddenly appeared in the center of the seal. He was stunned for a moment. The next moment, a vast energy seeped out.Red Moon Emperor was also confused!Of course, he couldn't care so much.This place ... Seemed to have been where Silver Moon was, and in that instant, the Queen laughed heartily."All of you, die!"BOOM!The monstrous power of the red moon swept out. In an instant, a figure appeared beside her. It was the extremely dense power of the red moon. It was not the red moon Emperor himself, but ... It was also a doppelganger, and this doppelganger was not weak.In fact, it wasn't any weaker than the one that had split out earlier!Red Moon Emperor's second clone was also a little confused. I just ... Created another clone?The Queen was overjoyed and suddenly summoned Silvermoon. A bright moon appeared and flew straight to Red Moon Emperor. Her voice was sharp,""Let's blow it up together!"Red Moon sovereign's second clone was stunned. The next moment, without saying anything, he punched the moon!In the void Dao universe, the sword-carrying man instantly looked at his first clone.The first clone didn't say a word, only watching silently.

Chapter 2439 Great Wisdom Appears To Be Slow-Witted?
I created another clone!If this clone can Enter the Void Dao universe and join with me, I ... Will be even stronger. As for how the Queen opened the original passageway, I have no idea.The last time, the Queen did not appear directly inside the seal, but walked through the original passage, which was later sealed.How did she open it? Who knows!However, there was no loss to him. Since his true body could not come out for the time being, he could use as much of his power as he could. If he did it a few more times ... His true body would not need to come out anymore. Other than losing a true venerable sovereign's body, he could use all of his power.This was a great thing for him.……Li Hao, on the other hand, had a huge headache!Li daoheng's schemes and thoughts ... He could deal with them all, but the Queen was a pawn. Instead of following the chess set, she had to do things her own way. This was a very troublesome matter!In fact ... It was a little exasperating.艹!Yet another clone of Red Moon Emperor was released. Judging from its strength, it was not much weaker than a half-step sovereign. Another half-step sovereign?She was really ... Speechless.I'm not ready to deal with an existence close to the half-step sovereign realm. The key is that the heaven and earth can't accommodate a half-step sovereign yet, and the reason he can appear is all because of that half-moon!Really ... He wanted to die.Please don't ruin my big plan!The Queen, on the other hand, had a look of satisfaction on her face at this moment. She revealed an extremely pleased smile.That's good, this King isn't someone who can't be calculated!Do you really think that this King is easy to bully?Since Li Hao dared to provoke him, he would summon the red moon Emperor and kill all of them!She turned her head to look at Li Hao, as if she wanted to tell him that he was not to be trifled with.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ This King can also scheme against li daoheng!But when he looked ... Li Hao's face turned livid!The Queen was stunned. What was he doing?For you, isn't it a good thing that Red Moon Emperor's clone is here to deal with Silvermoon?To avoid conflict with this King!Li daoheng schemed against me, and I'm helping you deal with him, and you're still not happy?At this moment, Li Hao cursed,""What are you doing! You bastard!"Li Hao was rarely angry!I knew it. Once this woman's mind is set, she will definitely harm everyone. Once the two avatars of the red moon Emperor become one, it will not be a good thing for everyone. He shouted in anger and suddenly shouted,""Li daoheng, explode!"In the virtual Dao universe, the sword-carrying man's expression did not look too good either. Suddenly, that half Silver Moon burst out with bright light, and a deafening sound reverberated through the entire world!An incomparably majestic power swept across the world.The half-moon exploded!The Queen madly vomited blood. She looked at Li Hao with some confusion. Are you ... Working together with li daoheng?Li Hao was too lazy to care. He saw a bloody shadow in front of him charging into the world, wanting to rush into the Dao universe and the void Dao universe. Without saying anything, Li Hao swept the world with his River and charged at the red shadow!In the virtual Dao universe, Red Moon Emperor's first clone had an unsightly expression. He was extremely cold."This is really ... Interesting!"Whether it was li daoheng or Li Hao, the moment his clone appeared, they actually chose to kill him first!Damn it!Even half of the Silver Moon had exploded. Damn it.Zheng Yu just watched the show and laughed. The red moon sovereign had overestimated and underestimated him. He had overestimated his intelligence and underestimated his strength. Whether it was him, li daoheng, or Li Hao ... No one wanted to start a war with a venerable sovereign.At least not now!With the two clones combined, this fellow might be able to directly penetrate his main body and seal it out. The Queen's reckless actions had almost ruined everyone's plan.At this moment, if he didn't kill his clone, who would he kill?When the clone's strength was even stronger than the main body's strength, was it that difficult to break the main body's seal?The three of them were not as simple as the Queen. At that time, this venerable sovereign would probably break the seal directly. Who would dare to let a venerable sovereign break the seal completely at this moment?Otherwise, the eight city seals would have been broken long ago!Below, Li Hao rose into the air, and the river swept across. At this moment, li daoheng, Zheng Yu, and even the gods who had wanted to slaughter the common people all chose to stop and give Li Hao time.Get rid of this clone!One was enough!If another one came and ruined everyone's plan, it wouldn't be a good thing for anyone.This kind of tacit understanding ... Was something the Queen did not have.Therefore, at this moment, Li Hao's sword pierced through heaven and earth and slashed at Red Moon Emperor. Red Moon Emperor's second clone was also a little confused and angry."Idiot, when my clones merge, I'll deal with those two first. Do you think those two are easy to deal with?"Li Hao, you actually stopped me!Damn it!Li Hao didn't say anything. I'm happy to let you deal with those two guys, but I can't let the venerable sovereign out today, or it'll be troublesome."If you fuse your clones, you might be able to summon your true body. Do you think we've never considered this?The long sword pierced through heaven and earth!However, this clone wasn't weak. At that moment, another moon appeared, and with a loud bang, the red shadow was forced back a step. It was the moon god herself!At this moment, a frosty figure appeared on the moon. He glanced at the Queen, who was still vomiting blood, as if he was thinking ... Why did he choose this idiot back then?
