        to Yuan Shuo's words, the accumulation of spirit was to nurture momentum, not simply to lock it.
        Following Yuan Shuo's instructions, Li Hao slowly inserted his [force] into the liver's Super Lock. The Super Lock that originally locked the willow tree seemed to have a strong resistance when the roots slowly merged with it.
        It was as if it didn't allow Shi to take root.
        Several attempts had all ended in failure.
        Li Hao opened his eyes and frowned.
        He had thought that it would be easy, but in the end ... It was not.
        He thought for a moment and decided to ... Break a bit of the superpower lock first. He could break some of the heart but not the other four organs. However, it was fine. The superpower lock could not be touched under normal circumstances.
        But Li Hao could.
        It was very simple.
        He fused the five Forces, used the sword force to lead, and dug a hole in the lock. Then, he forcefully rooted the force into it, and that was it.
         Thus, Li Hao didn't show any mercy.
        The five Forces instantly merged into the sword force and burst out directly, stabbing at the Super Lock on little tree's liver!
        There was a local Shout!
        This time, the sound of metal clashing was heard on the spiritual level.
        Yuan Shuo's eyes widened, and his face turned purple. He glanced at Li Hao and frowned. What is this kid doing?
        Is this ... Breaking the Super Lock?
        He wanted to say something ... But in the end, he shut his mouth. Forget it. Anyway, this guy wouldn't die. The sword energy was his greatest guarantee.
        He guessed that Li Hao was going to act rashly again!
        In his heart, he could not help but curse.
        'This kid isn't thinking of breaking the SuperLock by force and then merging Shi into it, is he?'
        He had told Li Hao to accumulate spirit, but that wasn't how he did it.
        This thing had to be coaxed slowly, like coaxing a wife. If one day did not work, then two days. If two days did not work, then three days ...
        As long as he had enough time, he could slowly blast it and feed the lock with some sword energy, blood Qi, and a little of his Shi. It would not take long for him to succeed.
        Li Hao had no patience at all.
        Yuan Shuo was also extremely vexed!
        This guy was really reckless at times!
        Of course, the other party had the confidence to be reckless, but there was no other way.
        Yuan Shuo's fusion of the five Forces and the integration of the superpower lock was not difficult. However, it still took him more than a month. It would take at least a week for him to take root with each force.
         And Li Hao ... This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com About half an hour later, Li Hao opened his eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood. He chuckled and said,""Teacher, I've settled Yi Shi! My wooden sword force has directly entered the superpower lock. I've officially stepped into the spirit accumulation stage, right?"
        “……”
        Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes!
        As he spoke, Li Hao raised his eyebrows."Teacher, the superpower lock doesn't seem to be responding to my force."
        "If you plant it forcefully, will they give you any feedback?" Yuan Shuo asked, his head aching. It's already good enough that it didn't shatter your Shi! Just wait for your force to slowly combine with the superpower lock. When the force lock is one, there will be feedback. "
        He was a little annoyed by this kid.
        Even though he had said and scolded her, she had indeed finished one post in half an hour. Wasn't that infuriating?
        Out of sight, out of mind. Yuan Shuo covered his ears and continued to absorb the sword energy.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, once again began his violent training.
        This kind of cultivation method could save him at least a month's time. If he could save it, of course, it was good to save it a little. As for others who couldn't ... That was because they didn't have the sword ability. They could slowly grind it.
        Next, Li Hao repaired the Super locks one by one.
        If you don't let me take root, I'll hit you!
        After many attempts, the five superpower locks seemed to have been beaten into submission. In the end, Li Hao's Five Forces were integrated into the superpower lock.
        However, the five superpower locks were still independent existences.
        One day, when the five could be combined into one, that would be the fusion God.
        And Li Hao wanted more than this.
        After he was done with this, he spoke again,""Teacher, there's still one more question. If I were to comprehend other sword forces, I want to root them into my limbs, spine, and purple mansion. Do you think that's possible?"
         Yuan Shuo raised his eyebrows."Bizhu, Zifu?"
        "Yes, one of them is the physical superpower lock while the other is the bone armor superpower lock. Didn't teacher notice?"
        Yuan Shuo couldn't help but curse this time,""You've been absorbing sword energy all day long and you've absorbed too much. You can't digest it and it's all thanks to the superpower lock. We don't have enough energy to absorb from our five organs and limbs ... How can we have so much potential to activate the superpower lock ..."
        After a few curses, he replied,"it shouldn't be a big problem. The five internal organs are a cycle, a small cycle!" The human body is a big circulation, and it's the same for everyone. It's just that it's expanded. Are you prepared to win by quantity?"
        Li Hao nodded."The five Forces have completely fused. Even if I have a teacher's guidance, I won't be able to comprehend them so quickly. I might need time. I don't know how long it will take." "If you can cultivate some cultivation techniques and then comprehend the appearance and strength of force, it would be much easier. In the end, you can use the sword force as a guide. This is also a way."
        "That's a good idea!"Yuan Shuo nodded.
        "Senior uncle Hong said so."
        "Shut up!"
        Yuan Shuo felt a little helpless. It would have been better if he didn't praise him just now. So it was Hong Yitang who guided him.
        However, he quickly added,"that's a good idea, but there's one thing. Is your sword force superclass strong enough?" Would he be able to lead all this? Your ancestor's sword was very powerful, but when you were comprehending it, it was too weak ... Perhaps, you should return to the Silver City and see that sword again!"
       
        ? Li Hao's heart moved, and he nodded.
        However, he soon frowned."Teacher, I may not be able to see it again. To see it, I need to activate the power of my bloodline. Only the blood God could do that, and he had to be stronger than me ... With my current strength, even a Blood God at the peak of the rising light Stage might not be able to do it. I'll need to at least reach the metamorphosis stage ..."
        "Then let's go to Red Moon!"
        "I'm sure there's still some on Red moon's side,"Yuan Shuo said matter-of-factly.
        Okay.
        Li Hao chuckled and nodded.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Perhaps, it was time to settle the score with the Crimson Moon. Furthermore, his teacher was right. Perhaps he should go back and take a look at that sword. When he first saw it, he was very weak.
        What he saw then might not be everything.
        At this moment, Li Hao's Five Forces were rooted in the Super Lock. He began to absorb and consume divine power stones to strengthen his five internal organs, body, and bones.
        Next, Li Hao prepared to fill up the Super Lock.
         Two-pronged approach!
        There was no rule that the Super Lock couldn't be saturated with spiritual energy. Li Hao was confident because he was rich and had many divine power stones.
        On the eighth day, Yuan Shuo stood up and interrupted Li Hao's training.
        Li Hao opened his eyes and glanced at Yuan Shuo.
        He knew that his teacher was about to leave.
        In fact, sometimes he did not understand his teacher.
        "At the current stage, being with me and using the sword to cultivate might be of greater help to teacher. When you go out, whether it's to dig graves or to kill people, aren't you doing this for the same reason?
        Yuan Shuo heaved a long sigh of relief. He was full of energy.
        He glanced at Li Hao and said with a smile,"you've been working well these past few days, but you've been here for a long time. I'm going to play with some old friends ... If you go to the central continent, take it easy. You're making progress, and so are others. You're not stagnant." You have the divine sword and the Windchaser's boots in your hands, so there will be many people who want to take advantage of you. As long as you don't surpass the sixth level, these people will not give up. "
        Li Hao nodded, feeling a little sad.
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, was not sad at all. He chuckled and said,"Then I'll be leaving first. You brat, walk around more and broaden your horizons ... And don't keep bringing this dog with you. It's too lazy to do anything, and it's too big of a target!"
        Black Panther was somewhat depressed. This old man was really bad!
        Yuan Shuo patted Heibao's head and laughed,""Stupid dog! As a great demon, he couldn't go on like this! A demon should have a demon's pursuit ... I know a place, Mount Tian Peng. There's a great demon there, a great heavenly Peng bird. If you can kill it ... You'll have a bright future!"
        "Don't think that you're invincible just because you've learned something from others. Fey are passed down from ancient Fey. Some things can be used by Fey but not by humans ... There are no weaklings among the descendants of ancient Fey. The Martial master's Secret techniques at the current stage may not be more powerful than these ancient Fey legacies."
        He didn't care whether Heibao had heard him or not.
        He only gave a few reminders.
        Very quickly, Yuan Shuo turned around and left. He was very carefree and did not have any sadness at all.
         Behind him, Li Hao stood up and watched him leave. When Yuan Shuo was far away, he sighed."Just say that you're going to find the Jade light sword. Why do you have to say so much? sigh!"  At such an old age, he still had the heart to look for a woman. Teacher ... It seemed that finding a woman was not as fun as finding a disciple.
        In the distance, Yuan Shuo, who was about to disappear, turned his head and glanced at Li Hao with killing intent in his eyes.
        This traitorous disciple!
        He really wanted to F * cking clean up his house!
        Spreading rumors all day long!
        Who went to find a woman?
        As he cursed in his heart, he suddenly thought of something and snorted. 'I'm just going to see if the jadesword has been killed. What is this traitorous disciple thinking?'
        Of course, he was also a little sad. After leaving Li Hao, he had to rely on himself.
        That's good!
        People of their generation were not suited to sit back and enjoy the fruits of others 'labor, and they did not like this either. Other than that shameless Southern Fist guy who freeloaded off, Yuan Shuo and the others were not interested in this.
        ……
        After Yuan Shuo left, Li Hao absorbed the sword energy for a few more days and kept his cultivation time at ten days. Then, he chose to leave.
        This was also the longest closed-door cultivation he had ever done.
        A full 10 days.
        It was already the end of October when he came out of seclusion, and it was almost November.
        If he continued to train, he might be able to reach the saturation point of the superpower lock, but it wouldn't be as great as he had imagined. His potential was still the key. Li Hao needed more potential. He also wanted to go back and see that sword.
         And all of this required one more thing, the blood God's clone that activated the bloodline.
        Moreover, it had to be a high-level one.
        Otherwise, if his force was too strong, he wouldn't be able to control the superclass of sword intent. At that time, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to merge the five Forces, and the five Forces would be in a state of disunity. Li Hao's strength would instead weaken as his force grew stronger.
        It was precisely because of this that Li Hao continued his journey with Black Panther.
        As for the Black Panther, it didn't pay any attention to Yuan Shuo's words. It wasn't going to leave. It was so comfortable to follow Li Hao and eat and drink for free, but it was too miserable to go out and fight to the death.
        ……
        On the last day of October, Li Hao left the villa and headed south.
        The central region was South of the eastern coast.
        Going north was the way back to the North.
        Li Hao didn't choose to go back. He wanted to go to the central continent and see the real powerhouses there.
       
        The central region was very large, encompassing 22 provinces and thousands of large, medium, and small cities. The population was much denser than that of the bitter cold North.
        The population in the central region exceeded two billion. In fact, in this era, the statistics were not accurate. Some remote places did not even know how to count. There were also many local officials who were not reliable. The population actually exceeded two billion.
        The entire central region was shockingly large.
        Nanquan had once told Li Hao that in the central region, there were some superhuman cities.
        In the central continent, the mysterious energy was rich, and the number of superpowers born was beyond imagination. It was said that there was at least one superpower in an average of one thousand people, and this was the statistics of the southern Fist. Li Hao felt that the guy's words might not be accurate since he was not good at mathematics.
        According to this ratio, there were more than 2 million supers in the central region!
        Two million superpowers?
        What kind of concept was that!
        At the very least, Li Hao had never seen so many supers before ... Fine, the most he had seen was the last time in heaven battling city when nearly 2000 supers gathered from all over the North.
        Those were all gathered from the 19 provinces in the North. Even though not all of them came, many of them were rogue cultivators, but they only had so few superpowers.
         There were over 2 million supers in the central region ... And the number of supers was increasing every year. It was not a constant. If there was no war, the increase would be very fast, or even more. In a province, wouldn't there be over 100000 supers?
        This was just a superpower, not a Martial Master.
        How many superpowers did the Silver Moon have?
        Even if it was a barren land, the difference shouldn't be so great.
        Therefore, Li Hao, with some disbelief or curiosity, officially entered the central region from the East Coast.
        ……
        The eastern coast was part of the central region.
        ,m However, the central region was also divided into different levels. There were 22 provinces in the central region, and there was a star belt, which was the radiation area with stellarsky city as the center. There were four mountains provinces in all directions.  They were the East, South, West and North mountains.
        Only by entering the four mountains province could one be considered to have truly entered the ring of the sky Star belt. These four major provinces were also the gateway provinces of the core of the central region. As for the eastern coast, it was too coastal.
        At this moment, Li Hao's target was the outer province of ring Sky Star City, East Peak Province.
        In the eyes of the central continent's people, those places within the four great mountains were the central continent in their hearts. Unlike Li Hao's group, they called the entire Heavenly Star continent the central continent, and there was a chain of contempt in the entire dynasty.
        The people of Sky Star City looked down on everyone, the provinces within the four Peaks, the people outside the four Peaks, the people in the central region outside the four Peaks, and the four continents.
        As for the four continents, the other three had joined forces to look down on the northern continent.
        The northern continent once again looked down on the northernmost Silver Moon.
        When it came to Silver Moon, he began to look down on the northernmost Silver City, which was small, poor, and broken ...
        When they arrived at Silver City, there was no longer any need to look down on them. It was as if the Li Dynasty had disappeared many years ago. Otherwise, they could look down on the barbarians in the North.
        This chain of contempt made Li Hao feel very helpless.
         Therefore, when he entered a Central City and wore Northern-style clothes, he was looked down upon by the people around him. That attitude ... Seemed to be saying,"where did this northern barbarian come from?"  Of course, Li Hao couldn't care less about this.
        This was his first time entering a Central City, and he could see the life of the ordinary people in the central continent.
        This wasn't a big city, and it felt similar to Silver City.
        It seemed to be much richer. There were many high-rise buildings, and there was some color to them ... In Silver City, it seemed gray and white. Silver City was bitter and cold, but Li Hao felt that it was not bad. No one had frozen to death or starved to death. In fact, it was not bad.
        However, compared to this, this small city actually felt a little prosperous.
        It was the largest port city in Silver Moon.
        "Old Hong lied to me."
        At this moment, Li Hao had such a thought.
        Mr. Hong said that the war had broken out in the central region. It was chaotic and the people had no means of living. Li Hao felt that the central region was actually very miserable, but this small city looked so prosperous.
        Li Hao was confused.
        The coastal areas near the river were worse off. He had seen it with his own eyes.
        The collusion between officials and bandits, killing the good for credit, it was particularly miserable.
        However, the central region did not look too bad!
        The sympathy he had for the central region and the people ... Was gone in an instant. Moreover, he was despised by others. Li Hao felt that he had been misled and deceived by Hong Yitang.
        Who said that the central region was miserable?
        Silver Moon might not be able to catch up to this small city even after another thirty years of development.
        Look, all of them are eating so well, how are they miserable?
         Li Hao entered the city like a country bumpkin. In fact, he was indeed a country bumpkin. Even if the natives of white moon City came here, the central continent would have to call them country bumpkins.
        He was walking on the street, looking around.
        At first glance, he gave off the impression that he was a newbie, probably from the North to make a living.
        As for the dog he brought with him, who knew where he picked it up from? a wild dog and a Savage were a perfect match.
        "Hi!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just then, someone greeted Li Hao from behind. It was a chubby middle-aged man with a bright smile. Li Hao's first impression of him was good. He looked a little like Hao lianchuan.
        Fatty Hao also liked to smile like that.
        "Little brother, are you from the North?"
        Li Hao naturally didn't know him, but he was also unfamiliar with this place. Walking ten thousand miles was also a form of martial arts cultivation. Li Hao nodded and smiled."Elder brother, you have good eyes!"
        "Hahaha! One look and I can tell he's a man from the North, lean and muscular. One look and I can tell he's a good man!"
       
        "First time in the central continent, right?" fatty chuckled and said enthusiastically. Looking for a job? Is there an acquaintance here?"
        "No, I just came to take a look ..."
        "No acquaintances?"
        "Then it won't be easy for you to survive here, little brother. The central region is more exclusive. It's not easy for Northerners to find a job here." It's better if we have a fellow villager to help us. "
        At this point, fatty laughed and said,"but I can tell that you're an upright young man. You have the strength. How about working for me?" A monthly salary of 4000 star dollars, food and accommodation included!"
        Li Hao took a deep breath!
        So high?
        He really thought so.
        When he was a civil servant in Silver City, he was an inspector. His probationary period was 1000 star dollars a month, and he was later promoted to 2000 star dollars. He was only able to get such a high salary after he was promoted to a first level inspector.
        In this place ... He could get 4000 star dollars just by randomly finding a place to work?
         "Thank you, but there's no need!"
        Li Hao usually had a better impression of fat people. At this moment, they were even more enthusiastic about introducing him to a job. Although he was going to work for them, the salary might not be the highest ... But he suddenly felt that the central continent seemed to be not bad.
        Of course, it would be a joke for him to find a job.
        Who was he?
        The Deputy Minister of the night patrolman's province, a senior City Patrol, the highest-ranking officer of this small city, was here. His status was 99% lower than his.
        Work?
        It was impossible for her to work in this lifetime.
        Of course, he was still working for dynasty.
        If silver Moon decided to rebel one day, he might still have to work for him. However, working for the government was more comfortable. Even if he did not go to work and skipped work every day, Li Hao knew that he would still be paid a decent amount.
        The fatty didn't mind and laughed again,"then little brother is here to play?" Don't run around these days. It's still fine in the city, but it's chaotic outside the city. The rise of superpowers is very noisy and people are killing everywhere! "From the North, you must have suffered a lot along the way. You're lucky to still be alive. I heard that there's a War in the North Sea too. A few days ago, there were even city-destroying bombs ... The war turned the world upside down ... Sigh, it's hard on us ordinary people."
        Li Hao nodded. The central region was a bull. Even a person from a small city could know about the North Sea. To be honest, he didn't know anything in the Silver City. He didn't know anything about the central region.
        "I'm quite familiar with this place if we're just having fun. Where are you going, little brother? I'll drive you there."
        He pointed to a car not far away and smiled.""That's my car. I like all people from the North. My wife is from the North. Little brother, get in the car and let's chat. Where are you going? I'll Take You There!"
        "I really don't need it!"
        Li Hao smiled. This was the first time he had met such a warm person.
        "You're welcome. It's on the way. I'm free now. I came out to recruit a few people to add to the factory, but I think it's hard to find them at this time. I'm going back too ... Where are you going, little brother?"  "You really don't need to ..."
        Li Hao refused again, but fatty pretended to be unhappy and said,""Little brother, aren't you being too polite? You can rely on your friends outside and make friends. Don't you like your big brother?"
        Li Hao was speechless.
        He really wasn't familiar with her!
        However, she was too enthusiastic. He thought for a moment and said,""I want to go all the way South to the four mountains province and see the star belt around the sky ..."
        "To the South?"
        "That's far ... You're a superhuman?"fatty was surprised.
        "That's not it. "
        Li Hao laughed."Backpackers. My teacher said that it's better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books."
        "A student?"
        Fatty was even more surprised,"you're still a student?" University?"
        Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded."I guess so. A student of a small Academy."
        The Silver City ancient Academy.
        If he didn't drop out, he would have graduated soon.
        "I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"Fatty laughed. "I'm still a scholar. I'm not very cultured. I know about the North. To put it bluntly, it's not easy to study to this extent in a bitter and cold place! Even in our place, it's rare to read to this extent. "
         He sighed and laughed."You have to be careful. I've heard that scholars travel the world ... It's not safe outside ... How about this, I'll send you to the South City. If you want to leave the city, you can go directly to the South. If you don't want to leave the city, you can play in the South City ..."
        "Many thanks!"
        Li Hao laughed. How enthusiastic.
        He followed fatty to the parking lot and opened the car door. There was another person in the car, who looked to be in his 30S. He was also sitting in the back seat. Fatty introduced,"The accountant in the factory came out to recruit people with me. It's a pity that you have to leave. If you don't leave, you're a college student ... Come to me as a cashier and I'll give you eight thousand a month! It's hard to recruit scholars these days. "
        The person in the car nodded at Li Hao and made some space for him.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As for Li Hao, he didn't pay much attention at first. A moment later, he frowned slightly and said nothing more. He got into the car, and Heibao also climbed in.
        The accountant in the car frowned at the sight of Heibao.
        Li Hao explained with a smile,"I picked up a stray dog from the roadside. I'm too lonely, so I brought a dog with me. Please don't mind me. If it's not convenient, I'll get off the car ..."
        In front, fatty chuckled."It's fine, it's fine. Little brother has a heart. It's a good thing!" It's a little dog, and it's quite adorable...Accountant Zhang, give some space to this little brother ..."
        In the back seat of the car, the man didn't say anything. He squeezed a little closer to the door. The car wasn't big, and the space in the back seat was even smaller. The Black Panther even took up some space. Li Hao wasn't too tall in the North, but he was very tall here. It was a little crowded.
       
        The fat man started the car. Accountant Zhang was a man of few words, but the fat man was a man of many words. As he drove, he asked with a smile,""Little brother, where are you from in the North?"
        "Silver Moon."
        "Silvermoon people? that's too far away. I know that place. There were martial masters there back then. I heard that they were quite barbaric ... Of course, it's all hearsay. Are you familiar with martial masters, little brother?"
        "I'm not too familiar with it. "
        Li Hao laughed."We're just students. We have nothing to do with these people. Just focus on your studies. After you graduate, you can find a public position. Those things are too far away from us."
        "That's true. "
        Fatty nodded. He was quite talkative and was very enthusiastic."In this day and age, those who can afford to study generally come from a good family. Looking at you, you must be a rich man in Silver Moon, right?"
        "Not really ... I'm doing well in school, so I got some subsidies from the government. I have some extra money at home, so I'm just making do with it."
        Li Hao replied with a few words, and the smile on his face gradually became strange.
        At this moment, he seemed to have understood something.
         Martial Master, superpower, family background, friends, fellow townsmen ...
        This fatty was talkative. If it was someone else, they would have emptied out their entire family and still have to admire their eloquence. They could talk about everything and had a wide knowledge.
        However, this car ... Why was it driving further and further away?
        Li Hao looked out of the window. The prosperity was gradually fading away.
        The noise gradually disappeared.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The bustling central region!
        It looked really good.
        This fatty was not bad either. He was very friendly.
        Li Hao had a good impression of the central continent at first, but gradually ... He felt a little regretful.
        "Brother, why don't you take the city Road?"
        "The streets are too congested. It'll take at least an hour to reach the South City. Take the outer area. Don't look at how far it is, it's faster ..."
        Gradually, the buildings on both sides of the road disappeared.
        This should be considered the suburbs, right?
        Li Hao gently exhaled. He glanced at accountant Zhang, who had been silent the whole time, and smiled.""Big brother Zhang, you're an accountant. There are 81 workers, and each of them is paid 3200 star dollars a month. How much do we get paid each month?"
        "Ah?"
        Accountant Zhang was a little stunned. He was stunned for a moment before he reacted. After hearing this, he was stunned for a while before he said,""Your family owns a factory?"
        "No, my friend's family is. They always say that the salary is high. I'll ask and calculate how much their family pays out a month ..."
        Accountant Zhang's eyes turned, and he stammered,""Well ... Actually, it's not that much money. There are more than 80 people in a small factory. We have a bunch of ..."
        With a thump, the car seemed to shake.
         The fat man who was driving in front coughed and smiled.""Accountant Zhang, I have a bottle of water in my trunk. Can you get it for me ..."  "Oh, oh!"
        Accountant Zhang turned around, as if he wanted to get some water. Li Hao sighed and didn't move.
        The next moment, a pair of hands suddenly appeared on his neck and strangled him tightly. While strangling Li Hao with all his strength, he gritted his teeth and said,""Fatty, do you want to kill him or bring him back? Why did you attack me halfway?"
        Fatty, who was driving in front, didn't even turn his head. He gritted his teeth and said,""Idiot, he's already suspicious of you when he asks you this, and you're still hesitating ... Strangle him and bring him back. The mine is short of people! Damn it, those who study are full of bad ideas. You're stupid too, you can't even figure this out ..."
        "Can you?"
        Accountant Zhang replied with great strength!
        From the looks of it, he knew a little bit of martial arts and might even be a martial arts practitioner. However, it seemed like he had yet to enter the tenth realm.
        While strangling Li Hao's neck, he cursed in a low voice,""Yes, your mother! Little brat, you've got quite a lot of ideas ..."
        But gradually, he felt that something was wrong.
        Why didn't this person resist at all?
        In the past, such incidents had happened before. There were even people who were knocked unconscious or killed halfway through the journey. However, when they resisted, they had some strength and struggled non-stop. But at this moment, why was this person not moving at all?
        He leaned over and glanced at Li Hao's face. The next moment, he was so scared that his liver and guts were about to split!
        At this moment, Li Hao's eyes were wide open as he looked at him. Seeing him look over, Li Hao even smiled. When he was done laughing, he sighed."How F * cking unlucky!"
        Fatty, who was driving in front, changed his expression and quickly braked!
        The next moment, Li Hao grabbed the head of the person who was leaning forward. He grabbed it and leaned forward while his other hand grabbed the fat man who was about to run away.
        The front seat was directly smashed into pieces by his kick.
        "Please spare us, Sir ... We're just trying to make a living ..."
        The fat man hurriedly cried out for mercy.
         Li Hao sighed,"I thought that the central region was quite good and prosperous!" You're so enthusiastic when you meet someone, so ... This is what you're doing. "
        "Sir, we were wrong. It's our first time ..." Fatty hurriedly begged for mercy.
        "Don 't! You guys are quite experienced!"
        Li Hao laughed. The fatty wanted to say something, but Li Hao casually squeezed his hand. With a crack, Li Hao crushed the Fatty's hand. The fatty screamed in pain. Li Hao laughed and said,"If you scream again, I'll crush your head!"
        The screams stopped instantly. Fatty was covered in sweat and grimaced in pain, but he didn't dare to scream anymore. He was dead!
        He knew that he had encountered a tough opponent.
        He asked again and again, was he a superhuman? no, was he a Martial Master? No...
        'F * ck, this kid is toying with us!'
        Superpowers and martial masters, who was so free?
        He was careful enough!
       
        Zhang's head was almost crushed. Li Hao threw it at his feet. The two of them were sweating from the pain.
        Li Hao frowned slightly."That's right. You captured and killed people. Just to mine?"
        "Yes ... Yes ... My Lord ..."
        Fatty was covered in cold sweat and stuttered in pain. He endured the pain and quickly said,""This ... This isn't our business ... It's ... It's the business of the inspector ... The inspector ... Opened the mine ... We ... Are just running errands ..."
        "If you get rid of one person, you'll only ... You'll only get 2000 Yuan in labor fees ..."
        "They're ... They're all foreigners ... Locals ... We don't dare to touch them ..."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Sir ... Don't kill us. We're just running errands. You're an expert too, Sir. You know ... What the inspector's office does. There's no need to attract the attention of the inspector's office just for two bugs like us ..."
        Li Hao immediately frowned,'the inspection Division is mining? Just hire people to open it, why do you need to arrest people?"
        Fatty didn't say anything.
        Accountant Zhang immediately said,""It's money-saving, and the profit is big ... How much is the labor fee for capturing 100 people? It was only 200000! However, 100 people, and they were mining work. Would they be able to do it without 3000 to 5000 a month? In a month, he would have to spend at least 500000 Yuan ... In fact, 100 people would not be enough. There were at least a thousand people in the mine, which meant that he would have to spend millions or tens of millions a month ... How much would he have to spend in a year? It's over a hundred million!"
         "Moreover, there are many refugees these days. Some cities in the central region have been destroyed, and the refugees are running around. There are beggars everywhere in the city, either thieves or robbers ... The inspection Office is so busy that they can't keep up with it. They have captured all of them and sent them to the mines ... It saves money and a lot of trouble ..."
        Li Hao was stunned.
        "Refugees?" he whispered.
        "Yeah! "There's a city near us that got blown up. At least 500000 people have nowhere to stay and have to run for their lives ... There are at least 10000 people here ... We don't have time to care about them. We can't even take care of our own people, and they're all so troublesome ... We'll capture all of them and mine them. It's good for everyone ... They won't starve to death, so it'll save us some trouble ..."
        Accountant Zhang was stupider than fatty, so he told him everything in one breath.
        Li Hao was deep in thought. So that was the case.
        By doing this, the inspection Office earned quite a bit of money and had less trouble. There were no more beggars and no more refugees. They didn't need to find a place to settle down and didn't have to worry about the small cases in the city.
        It was killing two birds with one stone!
        It was no wonder that Li Hao had felt that this place was really good and rich when he was in the city. There were beggars in Silver Moon, but here ... He had not seen any.
        Li Hao felt that the security was very good!
        How could it not be good?
        The beggars and refugees were all sent to the mines.
        Li Hao laughed."The director of the inspection Division here ... Is a talent!"
        He didn't know if it was sarcasm or true admiration.
        He was indeed a talent!
        Of course, Li Hao wasn't angry. There was no need for that. He had even seen the military colluding with Pirates, the high Duke's public houses raising Pirates, and the governors supporting Pirates.
        What had he not seen?
        It's just a small city's Inspection Office pretending to be peaceful and capturing people to mine for mining!
        And this was only one of the thousands of cities in the central region.  Perhaps, he was an exception.
        "Where is the mine?"
        "It's ... It's in front ... About ... About 40 miles ..."He said.
        It was quite far.
        Li Hao exhaled and didn't say anything. He stomped his foot on the two of them, making them unable to say a word. Li Hao leaned back in his chair and said the next moment,""Heibao, drive, let's go take a look!"
        The Black Panther wagged its tail and glanced at Li Hao. Seeing that Li Hao seemed to be serious ... It was a little excited. The next moment, it ran to the front, started the engine, and stepped on the accelerator ... With a buzz, the car sped past!
        Black Panther was acting like a dog, his two paws even gripping the steering wheel tightly, as if he was an experienced driver!
        It was a steady drive.
        Li Hao smiled. Fortunately, no one saw him. Otherwise, they would say that he was worse than a dog when he drove.
        Even a dog could drive better than him!
        It was really not bad.
        As the Black Panther drove, it even came up with a new pattern. Its tail hooked onto the steering wheel, drifting Li Hao ...
        At this moment, the two people who were about to be crushed to death in the car turned pale with shock and fear.
        Demon!
        This was a great demon!
        The central continent's people were much more experienced than the Northerners as they were able to understand the human language. In an instant, they were all terrified. This was at least a great demon of the radiant sun or the three suns realm.
        Li Hao didn't care about them. He just sat there, as if he was thinking about something.
        Half an hour later, Li Hao saw a mountain while the dog was driving at high speed. He didn't let the dog continue. Instead, he told the Black Panther to stop from a distance.
         After getting out of the car, Li Hao waved his hand, and the car disappeared.
        The two of them were terrified!
        A storage ring!
        This was the standard of the strong.
        As for Li Hao, he still didn't say anything. He carried the two of them with one hand and grabbed their arms. Like a rag, he squeezed them, and the two arms were like dough, fixed in his hands.
        The next moment, Li Hao flew into the sky, while the two of them had already fainted from fear and pain.
        ……
        In the air.
        Li Hao looked down at the mountain. There were a few superpowers guarding it. There might also be some martial masters, but they weren't too strong. They were either at the Starlight or Dark Moon level. He didn't see any sunlight.
        At this moment, in a gathering area in the mountains.
       
        It was very noisy over there. Li Hao flew over and took a look. It seemed that the food was being distributed. The Super voice came from there.
        At this moment, he was giving out food to a woman. There was a black bun and a bowl of porridge.
        It should be enough to fill one's stomach and not starve one to death.
        However, the woman was wailing and wailing,""Sir, give me one more mantou ... Just one ... I have three children. They're starving to death and can't move anymore. It's not enough for four people a day ... I won't sleep at night. After washing clothes in the day, I'll go to the mine at night ... Sir, give me another mantou ..."
        "Get lost!"
        An angry shout was heard as an inspector in inspector uniform kicked the woman away and said angrily,""You're not satisfied! I'll give you a way out here. Otherwise, you'd all be dead! He even asked for so much. Food was free? Do you know how expensive food is now? What year is it already, and you're still raising small ones? if the three of them starve to death, forget it. If they starve to death, they can still have a few more meals of meat. Are you not clear-headed? what are you thinking?"
        In the air, Li Hao was stunned.
        He looked down and thought to himself,"this is the central region, the extremely prosperous and wealthy central region. Just now ... He thought he heard the voice of Pirates."
        The first time he met the White shark Pirates, it seemed to be the same scene.
        "Pirates ... Garrison ... Patrol ..."
         He turned his head and looked in one direction. It was the small city.
        It was extremely prosperous!
        There were many people here, but it didn't seem to be the same era.
        Here, he saw history. He saw the chaotic era at the end of the dynasty in history, where people were like grass.
        However, this place, about 60 miles away, was a very prosperous small city. It was full of red and green lights.
        He shook his head slightly, and for a moment, it was as if he had traveled through time.
        "The central region is bustling ..."
        These four words appeared in his heart.
        The next moment, he thought of what Hong Yitang had said,"the dynasty will be in chaos, the world will be in turmoil, and the people will have no way to live. This era is hopeless!"
        This was the first time Li Hao had stepped into a city in the central region.
        What You see Might Not Be Real.
        Under the prosperity, there were some things that could not be seen.
        The destroyed cities and the refugees who fled seemed to be silent in the central region.
        How many mines like this were there?
        How much darkness was there?
        Li Hao smiled. He didn't know why he was smiling, but he lowered his limits again and again. Every time, just as he had a glimmer of hope ... It was instantly shattered!
        He thought that the central region was actually not bad.
        However, the next second, these people told him that the central region was darker than he thought. The back of prosperity was evil!
        An inspector from the inspection Office told everyone not to have children in this era. If they really died, they could have more meat ...
        Other than the woman, many people seemed to be numb!
        It was as if ... This place was also dark.
        "Patrol ..."
        Li Hao murmured softly and bitterly. His first job was an inspector of the inspection Division. In fact, he had a good impression of inspectors, because the ones he knew were all good.
        For example, Liu Long, Liu Yan, Wu Chao, Kong Jie, Wang Henggang, and many other patrol officers ...
         He was actually quite proud when he was wearing the inspector uniform.  Patrol officers ate public food and had nothing much to do. Civil servants did their work, while non-civil servants only caught thieves and solved cases. In fact, the pay was not bad, and it could be considered as maintaining peace.
        The night patrolmen were still in danger as they had to fight with the supers.
        The inspection ... Was not bad. Although it was a little dangerous, there were not many vicious cases.
        Many thoughts appeared in his mind.
        He felt that Linjiang was an exception, because fan Chang was not a good person.
        Over at the Dingbian side, the high Duke's public house colluded with Pirates. He felt that it was an exception and that the Xu family was not a good person.
        But here ... Who wasn't a good person?
        The inspector of this place is not a good person?
        What about the other places?
        After taking a deep breath, Li Hao flew away.
        Yes, it flew away!
        What could he do?
        He couldn't do anything.
        Kill these patrol officers?
        What's its use?
        It was completely useless!
        Furthermore, there were more than ten thousand people in the mine. This was the central region, so how could he send them to Silver Moon?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Don't joke around!
        So ... He would just kill the head of the inspection Division in this place. If he couldn 't, he would just kill more. After killing all the higher-ups, he wondered if it would be better if he replaced them with another group.
        He didn't know how to deal with Li Hao.
        Even if he was powerful!
        However, there was nothing he could do alone in a mine with over ten thousand people. He couldn't do anything. If he killed the chief patrol officer, it would cause more trouble.
        He knew what the consequences would be. In order to cover up everything, perhaps ... This mine would completely collapse.
         Everyone would disappear and be covered up.
        In the past, he had thought that it was impossible ... But now, he knew that everything was possible.
        Only by killing those higher-ups and not involving the mine and changing to another group of people would it be slightly better. Even if it was slightly better ... It didn't seem to be worse.
        He was the first to see such a place, but he would definitely not be the last.
        Li Hao really couldn't care less about the lives of these countless people.
        ……
        That night, a group of people died silently in this small Central City.
        Fatty and accountant Zhang pointed them out to Li Hao one by one.
        Li Hao killed all those who did evil.
        The strongest was only three suns. No one could escape from Li Hao.
       
        That night, Li Hao left the small town. Fatty and the fake accountant were burned to ashes by Li Hao. He continued his journey south.
        As for the future of the small city, he did not know.
        As for the tens of thousands of refugees in the mine ... He had no idea.
        At this moment, he understood Hong Yitang's struggle and difficulty. It was not difficult to save one person. The difficult part was how to settle them down and how to reignite their hope.
        The difficult part was a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand ...
        Ten thousand people in a small city were in trouble.
        How many people were there in the thousand cities?
        Li Hao felt terrified at the thought of this.
        This dynasty was like a cage.
        Hong Yitang actually aspired to be the Savior of the world ... Li Hao shuddered at the thought of it. It was too terrifying.
         He admired the other party's great will, determination, and spirit ... But he felt that there was no hope!
        "There's no hope!"
        "One can see the big from the small ... And this is the bustling central region. It's just a small city with a population of a million!"
        "Old Hong ... It's better to be a Martial Master."
        Li Hao mumbled as he walked.
        Master is still the best!
        Learn from master and travel the world with beauty.
        Master is right. My top priority is to find Hong Yue and take revenge. I'll leave this great task to Hong Yitang.
        I'm just a little Martial Master!
        A few days ago, on the day he killed the Pirates, he felt that he had the potential to be the Savior of the world. He killed the soldiers, the Pirates, and threw them to swords gate. Well done.
        However, today ... All of a sudden, all these thoughts were wiped out.
        But at this moment, Li Hao was also a little angry.
        How could the inspection Office ... Be like this?
        I'm also a member of the inspection Division, a high-level night patroller. How can you do this!
        "Did the current inspector grow up eating shit? I can't even do this!"
        "To maintain social stability and ensure the safety of the people ... What kind of rubbish oath is that!"
        Li Hao mumbled non-stop.
        This was the oath that the inspector had made when he first joined the company. He had once made an oath and recited it loudly with a group of people. It was extremely passionate.
        "So ... I want to go to stellarsky city to take a look!"
        Li Hao looked to the South and then to the center.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com I want to see what kind of people are controlling this dynasty, this world. It's right under your eyes. Are you all blind?
        "The Great War of the East, you all know about it in an instant.
        If one of Silver moon's supers died, you'll all know in an instant.
        Your eyes aren't blind!
        "When a ruin appears, you know about it faster than a dog. When you dig out a treasure, the whole world will know about it in an hour. When you build a useless three-hundred-mile bridge across the sea, you are so enthusiastic. Why didn't you see the black mine right under your eyes that makes people eat children?
        "Heavenly Star City ... Wait for me!"
        Li Hao suddenly stopped looking for the red moon. He wanted to go to the richest, most powerful, most energetic, most populated, and most powerful place in the world.
        Was it dangerous?
        It was very dangerous!
        But ... What did it matter?
        The teacher had said to go out and see more. This world was wonderful, indeed wonderful, so wonderful that as soon as they entered the central region, they saw a big show.
        Li Hao smiled.  'Then ... I'll go and see the most prosperous and exciting place in this world!'
        ……
        At the same time.
        Heavenly Star City.
        At the inspection Office.
        "Yes!" Someone reported."In Yaohai province, in a small city below, the chief Inspector, Deputy Chief, Captain, and vice captain of the law enforcement office in blissful city were all killed in one night!"
        "According to the report, it was probably done by an expert. I'm afraid his strength is not lower than three suns."
        "Oh, I know. Let the people in the Jade Sea arrest the murderer!"
        "Understood!"
        With a few simple words, the matter was over, and no one mentioned it again. For the huge Inspection Office, this matter was too small. They were in charge of 99 provinces and thousands of cities. If a small city's chief died, they could settle it locally. No one would ask much.
        Especially in this era where human life was as worthless as grass.
        It was just like how Silver city's mu Sen had been killed in Silver City ... At most, Silver Moon would care about it, but who would care about the distant stellarsky city?
        ……
        At the same time.
        At another location.
        Hou Xiaochen flipped through the information and looked at Chief Steward Yu,"Any news on Li Hao's whereabouts?"
        "No, I didn 't,"
        "This guy ..."
        Hou Xiaochen frowned,"he just disappeared!" It's said that even Yuan Shuo's whereabouts were discovered, and he went to look for the Azure light sword. As for Li Hao ... He's actually missing!"
        It was laughable!
        Li Hao, who had attracted the attention of the entire world, had actually disappeared. And yet, no one had discovered him, even though many forces were looking for him.
        "He might have gone back to Silver Moon," Chief Steward Yu said."He's not stupid. He knows that it's dangerous outside."
        Hou Xiaochen nodded his head slightly, but he was still a bit uncertain,"This kid disappeared near the East Coast. Did he come to the central continent?"
        Chief Steward Yu laughed. She rarely laughed, but at this moment, she couldn't help but say,""How can this be? How many people wanted to kill him? Even if the department head is here, it's like walking on thin ice ... I think this guy is very smart, he won't come. "
        "He even went to the East. Who would believe that?"
        Hou Xiaochen also laughed. After some thought, he said,"Forget it. If he disappears, so be it. Even if he comes to the central region, he won't come to stellarsky city. It's not bad to take a stroll around the outer region and experience the scenery of the central region ... When we go back, he will be promoted to an Imperial inspector. Old Zhao and the others will probably let him take over my position. It's not bad."
        Chief Steward Yu didn't say anything, but he felt ... That it was a little awkward for Li Hao to take over.
        Of course, this was director Zhao's business and had nothing to do with him.
        At this moment, even hou Xiaochen didn't believe that Li Hao would come to stellarsky city.
        The core of this dynasty!
        Here, the nine divisions, the imperial family, the noble families, and the sacred mountains were all mixed up. A group of heaven-blessed God tier Masters roamed freely. Even he had to be careful and arrogant here, but he had to be under the rules.
         Countless people wanted to eat Li Hao.
        He couldn't even cover her if she came here.
        There had been some drama before, but after the Li family's divine sword's uses were exposed and Xu Qing was killed, hou Xiaochen felt that it was a good thing that Xu Qing didn't come to the central continent with him. Otherwise, he would have lost his life trying to clean up his mess.
        Many thoughts flashed through hou Xiaochen's mind as he rubbed his temples.
        It was so difficult here.
        He had to be careful with every step he took. The waters in stellarsky city were too deep.
        Now, he still lacked the opportunity to break out of this situation.
        He thought and calculated in his heart, should he let those evildoers do something out of line?
        But ... Would it work?
        Did they dare to?
       
        It was now November.
        Li Hao headed straight for stellarsky city.
        Along the way, he did not stop. He walked and looked around like a normal person. He did not make a move again, even though he saw the dangers of the world and the evil deeds of superpowers.
        He didn't kill again.
        There were countless bad people in this world.
        The root of the problem wasn't here.
        Where was he?
        In fact, Li Hao didn't know.
        Was he in stellarsky city?
        Maybe.
         The superpower lock was slowly being saturated, and the bridges of the five internal organs were taking shape. The five Forces were also gradually receiving some feedback from the superpower, and their forces seemed to be growing. The breathing technique of five birds was constantly operating, and Li Hao was also becoming stronger under its subtle influence.
        The road in the middle was very wide.
        Although it was a little chaotic, most of the time, the central region could still be passed.
        A few days later, Li Hao arrived at Dongyue province.
        After crossing Dongyue, they continued forward. After crossing Dongyue, they would reach the blue sea province, and then stellarsky city.
        The area around the sky-revolving Star City was very interesting.
        The four great mountains were the periphery, and there were a few provinces inside. These provinces surrounded the Heavenly Star. Outside the Heavenly Star City, there was actually a sea, and it was also the largest inland sea. Only after crossing the Heavenly Star sea would one be able to reach the center of the dynasty.
        However, the stellarsky sea wasn't dangerous. It was surrounded by experts, and they were all in the central region. Whoever dared to be a pirate in the stellarsky sea would be a true Bandit.
        Although it was called an ocean, it was actually quite similar to the Silver Moon's ocean.
        It wasn't too wide. It wasn't like the East Ocean, where the narrowest part was a spectacular 300 miles. Although stellarsky city was called an ocean, it was actually very narrow. The narrowest part might only be three to five miles wide.
        ……
        Li Hao kept thinking about the map he saw.
        He continued forward.
        On the way, the situation was different.
        The number of cars on the road increased.
        There were many people and many cars.
        The main road was wide and filled with people. Superpowers were no longer rare and could be seen everywhere.
        Li Hao, who was driving a broken car, heard a voice.
        It was the central government's language that was mixed with a sense of pride. In this place, ordinary people seemed to speak with more confidence, unlike in other places where their words sounded a little weak.
        "There's been a lot of cars going to Tian Xing city recently!"
        "Yes, it's normal. The Imperial City, the nine divisions college and the Royal College are recruiting new students at the end of the year. Once you enter the college, you'll be above the rest!"
         "I heard that there's a new Deputy Minister in the night patrol. He's a barbarian from the North and he's very ruthless. He's going to lead the Academy's students to kill the people from the three major organizations. If we go register now, we won't be taken away to kill people, right?"  "It's hard to say ... But no matter how ruthless he is, he's only a Deputy Minister of the night patrol. I heard that he was demoted to a senior city inspector, not even a provincial governor ... I think he'll be put in jail sooner or later!"
        On the way, some people were chatting.
        These ordinary people were well-informed in the central core region, so they were more courageous in their words. They were also full of praise for the high officials.
        Hou Xiaochen had been here for a month, and he'd actually made a name for himself.
        Li Hao didn't have a communication Jade with him. It belonged to the big organizations and had its location. Li Hao didn't want anyone to know its location, so he didn't take it.
        That was why he found out that hou Xiaochen had been demoted.
        An advanced city Patrol was at the same level as him.
        Li Hao smiled. He hadn't been in a good mood these days, but after hearing this news, he couldn't help but laugh. His mood suddenly improved.
        Old hou had actually reached the same level as him.
        In his heart, he thought of the Academy.
        Back then, Nan Quan had invited him to Tian Xing city. He had said that there were a few super Academies that were very famous in Tian Xing city. Among them, Tian Xing Academy was the Royal Academy. Other than that, there were other Academies established by the nine divisions.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was a school where only superhumans could enter, and a large number of god tier Masters gathered.
        It was built in an imitation of the martial arts universities in the ancient civilization.
        There were many geniuses among them, and there were many heavenly god tier Masters.
        At the end of the year ... They were going to recruit new students?
        He suddenly felt that he was very far away from her. A student ... More than a year ago, he was still a student.
        It was said that during the ancient civilization, there were many such schools ... They were called martial science universities back then.
        Li Hao stopped his car at a traffic light and waited for the road to pass.
        At that moment, the cars on both sides of the road moved out of the way.
        Li Hao turned his head and looked behind him. A fleet of cars was approaching. Beside him, the driver of a car glanced at Li Hao. Seeing that he was unmoved, he hurriedly shouted,""Hey, are you from another city? Hurry up and move! That's the Xu Guang family's convoy. If you don't move, no one will be responsible for you if you die!"
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He quickly controlled the car and steered it to the sides.
        A moment later, the convoy of more than ten cars passed through the middle. The light in front had turned green, but no one moved. They were all waiting for the convoy to pass.
        In the middle of the fleet, there was a luxury car that even Li Hao couldn't recognize ... It looked very luxurious.
        In the luxury car, the windows were open.
        Other than the driver, there were also two young people, a man and a woman.
        The man looked indifferent, while the woman looked curious. They looked around and seemed to rarely go out. They looked around and said something, but no one could hear them if they were far away.
        Li Hao had heard some of it.
        "Brother, brother, look, that car is so broken, but there's still someone driving it ..."
        Li Hao didn't mind.
        A moment later, he saw that the other party seemed to be looking in his direction. He was slightly startled and subconsciously looked at his car ... Well, the car that he had taken from the fat man and the accountant was indeed a little broken.
       
        Previously, he had kept it in his storage ring and would only take it out to open when there were many people.
        Of course, it was unrecognizable.
        In order not to be recognized as the same car as before, Li Hao made some damage and broke the license plate in half. No one could tell that it was the same car as before.
        In the luxury car, the young man turned his head and glanced indifferently at the driver in the car. Seeing that the other party seemed to be looking in his direction, he did not care and said in a calm tone,""This is the life of the poor! Remember, if you and I don't work hard to maintain our family's glory, in the future, you and I may be the same kind of people. "
        The girl shuddered a little."It can't be, right? That would be too terrifying! Brother, is there such a poor person in the central region? Our central region is very rich ... It's about the same in the North. "
        "There are poor people everywhere. You just didn't see them. Do you see them now?"
        "Yes, yes!"
        The girl nodded."That's why when we go to the stellarsky city this time, we must join the stellarsky Academy!"
        “……”
        Li Hao listened in silence. A poor man's car ...
         Between the two siblings, the younger sister was ignorant, and the older brother pretended to be all-rounded, but he was actually ignorant.
        How could the poor afford to drive a car?
        Those who could afford to drive were not poor.
        That's right, the central region was bustling, the further in, the more prosperous it was!
        Everything you see is extremely prosperous. If the circle you come into contact with is the same circle of people, you can't see those places, and it's impossible to see them.
        Was this brother and sister in the wrong?
        Li Hao didn't think so.
        He was just ... Ignorant.
        And this kind of ignorance was not just one or two people. In the entire upper circle, some people were really ignorant, some were pretending to be ignorant, and some people ignored everything.
        They had never received such an education. Whether it was a family or an aristocratic family, they might not have instilled such things into their children.
        The fleet of cars slowly left.
        The pedestrians 'voices rang in her ears again."Which Xuguang clan is he from? Are we going to stellarsky city?"
        20 years after the appearance of superpowers, the rising light had already formed a family.
        However, sunguang was indeed an expert, and he was one everywhere.
        With Xuguang here, money and wealth would not be a problem. Once they had a firm foothold, they would also be an Overlord. These people seemed to make way for these powerful families as a matter of course.
        From the looks of it, this was not the first time.
        "Someone from Dongyue real estate ... I think so."
        "Oh, it's their family 's. That's normal. I said that these cars are all luxury cars. To their family, they're just average."
        "I heard that the grandson and granddaughter of the person from Dongyue real estate have reached the school age this year. They're probably going to stellarsky city to register."  "The two heavenly god tier Masters?"
        "Right! One was born to be a Dark Moon, while the other was born to be a brilliant sun ... I'm so jealous!"
        "Sigh, I know. I don't know what these rich people are doing. They have a higher proportion of heavenly priests than us ..."
        The group of people discussed and quickly dispersed.
        Li Hao continued to drive his car forward.
        Heavenly priest.
        He could tell that there were two sun glory cultivators, one at the peak stage and one at the early stage. He didn't expect them to be god tier Masters.
        The two of them didn't look very old.
        It was said that the major Academies only recruited young people under the age of 22. The realm of the sun glory that Wang Ming was so proud of ... Well, old Wang had now entered the early stage of the three suns realm, but the sun glory realm before that was like a common product here.
        He could easily meet the young sunlight.
        To think that Lao Wang had been so proud back then, being the youngest sun glory expert!
        In the end, Li Hao randomly met two of them, and they were both stronger than you. They didn't look too old either, perhaps even younger than Wang Ming.
        The convoy in front of them was not moving very fast.
        Not long after, Li Hao saw them again.
        This was because he also wanted to go to stellarsky city.
        Li Hao wasn't the only one. On the way, almost everyone was heading to stellarsky city. However, this wasn't the only fleet on the road. Soon, more fleets of cars passed by.
        He seemed to be the second or third generation of some family.
        Soon, they met up with the motorcade in front. The two parties were not driving very fast, so Li Hao and the others could only follow them slowly. Some of them were cursing in low voices, but they could only watch and wait.
         No one dared to overtake them!
        The people in front of them did not show any arrogance, but no one dared to overtake them. In the central region, it seemed that they were more concerned about these things and had a higher hierarchy.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In Silver Moon ... If there was a car blocking the road ahead, the driver would not care whose car it was and would simply overtake it.
        "That's a car from the square Corporation ... The two companies are even having a conversation. If they continue to talk, they won't even be able to reach Tian Xing city tonight!"
        Someone complained non-stop.
        They were already out of Dongyue, but to get to stellarsky city, they still had to cross the blue sea province. It was still morning, but if they didn't speed up, they wouldn't even reach stellarsky city by night.
        "What's the hurry ... Can these people chat for too long? When they get on the highway, they'll be gone in the blink of an eye. You won't be able to catch up with them even if you want to. "
        Someone in the car replied.
        Another person laughed and said,"just wait and see. Recently, there have been a lot of such carriages on the road. From the 15th of November, all the major Academies will begin to register for enrollment and selection. It will continue until December. Then, they will rest for a period of time and prepare for the new year. The next year, they will enter the academy ... During this period, the stellarsky city is overcrowded with people. There are superpowers everywhere, and there are students who are registering everywhere ..."
        "Why are you all heading to Heavenly Star? There are even more Academies there, and ... I heard that some of the academies ... Are even secretly supported by the three great organizations. "
