In the end, Kong Ji restrained his desire.Or rather, in the face of an even more shocking event, he had forgotten about his advancement.Li Hao was actually breaking the Dao in the stars of time.This was too terrifying!Time was the most incredible Dao in everyone's eyes. It was almost omnipotent. Although he had to pay a huge price every time, it had to be said that the existence of time Dao had helped Li Hao accomplish many incredible things.When Li Hao was about to destroy the way of time ... Kong Ji felt that a mere Level 7 was nothing.Was this a temptation?It didn't count!"It's not like I can't enter the seventh step. He made it to the 6999th square that day. Now that he has gained more insight, he's confident that he can make it to the 7000th square if he does it again.Since that was the case, tier 7 was a matter of hand.Now, even if he ate the Flower of Life, he would only be one step ahead.In front of Li Hao, he suppressed the greed in his heart.Sighing, he glanced at Li Hao. This guy, who had just stepped out of the Silver Moon and become a level one venerable Emperor, was now ... Unbelievable.Flowing time!How many people were envious of him? to think that he would dare to treat Shi Guang as a toy! That was truly unbelievable!"Let's continue!"Kong Ji didn't say anything else. He suppressed the other thoughts in his mind."I'm going to continue destroying the world. The world origin hasn't appeared yet ... The appearance of the world origin means that I've truly reached the extreme of destruction. The world is about to be completely destroyed."Li Hao nodded.He did not continue to interfere. Instead, he looked up at the sky and said,""You continue with your Nirvana, I'll go up and take a look."The great Dao universe!Kong Ji frowned slightly and quickly nodded,""Then be careful!"This great Dao universe that had been destroyed might not have really died. It had only been destroyed, not destroyed. Back then, the master of tianfang had only extracted all the power of the great Dao within it, but the master of tianfang ... Was still the master of the great Dao universe!Did the other party leave something behind?Nirvana didn't know, nor did Li Hao.Everyone was trying to seize tianfang, but had they ever thought that ... The master of tianfang might not be willing to let them seize the great Dao universe?……Li Hao rose into the air.He instantly entered the great Dao universe.Billions of stars stood quietly in the universe of the great path. They didn't shatter, but they were dead silent.At this moment, many stars were emitting dim light.This also meant that with the eruption of the Taoist connotation, these stars were showing signs of being stimulated. Previously, because he knew that this universe had been destroyed, Li Hao had not investigated it deeply.They were just deathly silent great Dao stars.But today, Li Hao went straight to the depths of the universe in search of the origin of the great Dao. He wanted to see where the origin of the great Dao was and what it looked like.Li Hao had seen Red moon's origin of great Dao. It was like a heart, rooted in the depths of the universe.The Dao of desire was gathered to form the Dao origin of desire.It was the same for the other three worlds.As for the Silver Moon's origin of great DAOs, it was the time star at first. Later, as the time star was taken away by Li Hao, the two rivers of great DAOs became the origin of great DAOs. Not every universe had Dao rivers, and the creation of Dao rivers often represented sharing both good and bad.It wasn't that the master of the great Dao couldn't cast it, but that he was unwilling.The Dao River was connected to the people.Universes like the red moon were not connected to the people, but to the Monarchs, which were the Dao of the venerable sovereigns. Only then could they be connected to the origin of the great Dao. Not everyone was qualified to connect their own orthodoxies to the origin of the Dao.In fact, the Silver Moon was created by Li Hao. Whether Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang were willing or not ... In the end, the great Dao was connected to the people.At this moment, Li Hao was extremely fast.He headed straight for the depths of the universe.The last time the various monarchs entered the Dao universe, they might have found the Dao source, or they might not have found it. In any case, the Dao source must have been destroyed, otherwise, no one would have left so easily.As for Li Hao, he didn't see the daosource last time.He was extremely fast!At this time, there were stars shining beside him. The sky universe was not in the form of a River of Dao. The stars were not gathered together. However, the stars of the Silver Moon were all gathered together. This had its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest problem was that if it was invaded, it could easily destroy the entire universe.Capture them all in one fell swoop, leaving no one alive.Li Hao didn't pay much attention to the stars. He just kept moving forward. After flying for a while, the universe seemed to have come to an end.With his current rank five venerable sovereign level, he was comparable to a peak rank six.At this speed, no one was able to stop him. Even though he was allowed to gallop, he still had to fly for a period of time before he reached the end. This showed how big this universe was.At the end of the world ... An enormous planet appeared, surrounded by many smaller planets.This huge star seemed to be the Dao origin of the universe. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  It was an existence similar to the time star, the space Star.However, at this moment, it was completely dead. There was no movement at all. Last time, Hong Yue and the venerable sovereigns should have been here. At this moment, some traces could be vaguely seen on the huge star.The traces of battle!The light Thearch and the others must have arrived at this place that day. They must have even fought here and tried to control and activate this star, but they must have failed.Otherwise, they wouldn't have retreated just like that.Li Hao examined it carefully. This huge star seemed to have threads that connected all the other stars in the universe. With it as the core, a huge net was woven, forming the tianfang universe.

Chapter 3091 The Origin Of The World (2)
If he wasn't wrong, he might have connected 9998 stars, or 9999 stars. He didn't know if the 9999 stars had fused into one to create space, or if it was something else.Li Hao hadn't come here to investigate before, so he knew that it was a waste of time.However, he had arrived here today.He silently looked at the incomparably huge star.He seemed to be lost in thought.A dead star!Was this the orthodoxy of the master of space, the master of Tian Fang?When you left, you took away all the power of the great Dao, but you left the daosource ... Aren't you afraid that someone will use the daosource itself to deal with you after this place is activated?Or are you so confident that no one can activate the universe, and even if they do, they can't do anything to you?Or perhaps ... You share some of my thoughts and have abandoned this universe?Li Hao often thought of abandoning a universe.Tian Fang master was a level nine venerable sovereign ... So what if he abandoned a universe?Many thoughts flashed through his mind.Previously, he had vaguely sensed that someone was spying on him. Was it the master of Tian Fang?Was he spying on him through this star?However ... He did not seem to notice anything unusual. At this moment, he did not feel like he was being spied on."The great Dao has been destroyed, but the world doesn't have it! The great Dao and the world should have been one and the same, more or less related ...""The great Dao universe has been destroyed for many years. Logically speaking, the world should also be declining, from level nine to an even lower level ... The origin of the world has absorbed chaotic energy for countless years. Why can't it revive this great Dao universe?"The master of Tian Fang and the others had left this place for at least a million years!The least!In a million years, a top-tier great world could absorb the surrounding chaotic force. Even a first-stage venerable sovereign could absorb more than 300 great Dao crystals in a year. In a million years, they could absorb more than 300 million great Dao crystals.However, this was a level 9 world!It was more than that!A hundred times was a small number. No matter what, a world would absorb more than that amount of great Dao crystals in a year. It might even absorb more than 30 billion, or even a thousand times ...Even if the source of the world would spread energy and allow cultivators in the tianfang realm to cultivate, there would definitely be countless great Dao crystals.How much?100 billion?He did not know.Up until now, the origin of the world had yet to appear, so Li Hao wasn't sure. However, the Dao chess Phantom had said before that some of it would be left behind."Perhaps ... I can calculate it!"Li Hao had some thoughts in his mind, but he didn't say them.He just stood there and waited in silence. Wait for the appearance of the source of the world!……Tianfang world.Countless Taoist connotation growled. However, with Dao Qi and the four level Seven venerable sovereigns around, those Taoist connotation were only remnants of Taoist connotation from years ago. At this moment, they couldn't resist the destructive emptiness at all!In front of Kong Ji, the Flower of Life grew stronger and stronger. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  At this moment, Kong Ji was less greedy and more carefree.Seeing the Nirvana world expanding, he smiled. When the world was restored, he might see something different.There might be a huge leap in the path of destruction and revival today.……At the same time.There were countless Silver Moon cultivators everywhere. Some were comprehending the great Dao, while others were absorbing the power of the great Dao. The two chaotic rivers were also absorbing the great Dao and comprehending the Dao accumulations.For Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang, this was a rare opportunity.Tian Fang was a level 9 world!​ In the past, it was very difficult for the Taoist connotation to burst out. Today, it burst out continuously and was constantly absorbed by them.In addition, Li Hao had explained the Dao web system to them previously. For the two masters of great DAOs, this was a huge improvement.Dao, the more one looked, the brighter it became!The two Dao Masters weren't fools after seeing so much. At this moment, they felt that they had benefited greatly. All kinds of great Dao inspirations filled their hearts. Advancing from level four to level five was just a process of energy accumulation.They already had enough energy, but they had been suppressing it because they had advanced too quickly. At this moment, as the Taoist connotation flowed into the river, different insights filled their hearts.For a moment, the two rivers of the path were trembling.There were signs that he was about to advance!It was a trend of advancing from Grade 4 to Grade 5.This made the two Dao Masters extremely happy.At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns, who were in charge of their Taoist connotation, had also gained a lot.The place where the southern Fist was suppressing the Taoist connotation was the Coiling Dragon Well. The Dragon Taoist here, who was good at the Dao of the physical body, was also unleashing his Taoist connotation. Li Hao had not completely extracted the Taoist connotation of the Coiling Dragon Well.He had only borrowed the Taoist connotation of the fire element mountain.At this moment, Nan Quan laughed out loud. He was overjoyed. There were a few other experts around him, like director Zhou who cultivated the Golden body. However, Nan Quan felt that he had gained a lot.His physical body could suppress the world!As he watched the Dragon Tribe giant's body shake continuously and its shadow become incomparably powerful, Nan Quan was overjoyed. He felt that he would definitely be one step ahead of the others this time.He had asked Qian Wuliang and the others about the existence of the seventh-grade Taoist connotation through special treatment, so he came here on purpose.At this moment, a seventh-grade Taoist connotation had really appeared."Hahaha ... I'm probably going to be the first level two venerable sovereign ..."

Chapter 3092 The Source Of The World (3)
Not counting those who had already advanced to venerable sovereign, Nan Quan felt that this time, he might be able to surpass everyone again and become the first person to enter the second stage of venerable sovereign. His laughter was loud and wild.Because he felt that a large amount of great Dao power began to appear in his body. The energy in this Taoist connotation was too abundant!Who said that this was an abandoned place of Taoist connotation?Not far away, director Zhou frowned.In fact, he had also sensed it.In his body, the power of the great Dao filled the air. This Taoist connotation seemed to be full of energy.From stage one to stage three, one didn't really need to comprehend the Dao.With enough energy, it could be upgraded directly.He also felt that he was about to reach rank two. The feeling of being unable to suppress it was unbelievably fast. Countless great Dao powers were madly attacking him.Nan Quan laughed crazily, but director Zhou wasn't as happy as him.At this moment, his entire body was shimmering with golden light.The next moment, his expression suddenly changed as he shouted, "Let's go!"After he finished speaking, he rose into the air and was about to teleport away."What do you mean go? you're jealous of me ..." Nan Quan laughed.Director Zhou cursed and quickly shouted, "Something's wrong ...""I know!"Nan Quan didn't seem to be stupid. He laughed and said,""What are you afraid of? The bold die from overeating while the timid starve to death! Old Zhou, don't be afraid ...""The origin of the world seems to be here!" He roared.The southern style had been in the martial arts world for many years. Although everyone wanted to beat them, they had lived to this day.His mouth was extremely cheap, but he lived a good life. He had lived a carefree life in the palace back then, so he wasn't really stupid.Li Hao had said before that Southern Fist was a reckless person on the surface, but in reality, he was the best at assessing the situation.At this moment, of course, he also felt the difference. How could he not know that an abandoned Taoist connotation would not have such a rich power of the great way? even if he used his brain to think, he knew that something was wrong.He didn't care about director Zhou's cowardness, he wanted the bold one to die!"I know that there's a high chance that the world origin is here ... But I also know that I have the greatest hope and the greatest possibility to quickly rely on the energy of the world origin and the infinite life force to step into the level of a third stage venerable sovereign.He quickly closed the gap between him and Qian Wuliang.He would become one of the top venerable sovereigns below the path master. He would be a level three venerable sovereign.Seeing that old Zhou had run away, he was absorbing more and more energy by himself. He even showed signs of bursting. He had no choice but to shout.In the distance.Kong Ji heard the sound and was shocked.Previously, he had discovered the location of the source of the world. At this moment, hearing the roar of the southern Fist, he quickly flew toward the Coiling Dragon Well.At this moment, the Coiling Dragon Well was bursting with the power of countless lives. It was as if it wanted to destroy the world of Nirvana around it!"Bang!""Bang!"It was like the sound of a heartbeat. At this moment, some of the places that had been destroyed began to recover. The source of the world was also the source of life. It was the source of life.And the reason why it appeared near the Coiling Dragon Well was most likely related to the path of the physical body.Li Hao had once cultivated the physical body, which gave birth to a lot of life energy.Following the roar of the southern Fist, everyone's attention was drawn to the Coiling Dragon Well.The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns also quickly focused their gazes.On the other side, the chess figure was also a little nervous.The world origin of a rank nine world, the source of life ... Under normal circumstances, the world origin did not have any combat power or resistance. Therefore, the world origin of a small world could be easily devoured.However, at the ninth step ... There might be some unexpected results.The sound of the heart beating ... At this moment, as the sound spread, the whole world seemed to be recovering.Kong Ji, who was rushing over, suddenly felt his heart begin to beat rapidly. Kong Ji was feeling extremely uncomfortable. As the world origin began to send out life fluctuations, the entire world began to recover.It instantly caused the invader, the silent destroyer, to suffer a backlash!"Bang!"The throbbing sound reverberated through the world."Pfft ..."A mouthful of blood spurted out from his mouth as Kong Ji's heart began to beat furiously. Boundless destructive power converged toward him, as if it was going to destroy him. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  At this moment, a sword light flashed as if it was going to cut the heaven and earth!In the next moment, a dark cloud appeared and covered the sky and earth. It shrouded the void and concealed the secrets of heaven!Venerable the sword and the others also made their moves at the same time.The chess figure also trembled slightly, his voice reverberating,""Suppress the source of the world!"Hurry up!Otherwise, Kong Ji would face the counterattack of the entire world and himself.The sudden appearance of the origin of the world seemed to be more powerful than imagined. It hadn't appeared yet, but with just one beat, it almost caused the peak rank 6 void to suffer heavy injuries!A Nirvana world would also welcome a world's counterattack.However, ordinary worlds did not have the ability to fight back against a sixth-rank venerable sovereign. Even seventh-rank or eighth-rank worlds might not have this ability.But now ... There was one in a level nine world!Not only that, at this moment, because Nan Quan was standing at the same spot, he saw and felt something. He was suddenly shocked and no longer cared about his advancement. He roared,""Oh no, it seems like something is about to appear ..."At this moment, some of the collapsed shadows suddenly reappeared in some Taoist connotation.Not only that, these illusory figures seemed to be endowed with some energy and life force in an instant, and they began to materialize one after another.

Chapter 3093 The Source Of The World (3)
The others didn't understand, but the chess figure did. His expression changed instantly."Not good!""Damn it!" The mysterious man roared."The origin of the world has given these Taoist connotation the power of life. It wants to resurrect them ..."It was not considered a resurrection.However, these experts were all born in tianfang world. Strictly speaking, they were the source of the world and the mother of all tianfang people. At this moment, they felt the destruction of the world.As for the recovery of the void ... That was the matter of the void. At this moment, the origin of the world clearly felt that the world was about to be destroyed and was facing a life-and-death crisis. Therefore, at this moment, at all costs, it gave these Taoist connotation phantoms life force.At this moment, the experts who walked out of tianfang world seemed to have their Taoist connotation revived.Waves of extremely powerful auras and pressure spread across the world! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  In fact, there were even some Level 7 and level 8 auras.The color of the void changed!How could this be?In the past, small and medium-sized worlds had been destroyed before, but such a terrifying situation had never occurred.The expressions of Sword Saint and the others changed."These shadows have been endowed with energy ..." Venerable the sword said in a low voice."It's not enough and can only last for a while. But be careful!"Even if it was only for a short while, there were too many venerable sovereigns in Tian Fang.Not only that, but there were also seventh-grade, eighth-grade, and even ninth-grade existences.At this moment, the source of the world was trying to save itself.These existences were conjured once more.If even the master of Tian Fang had been projected ... That would be truly terrifying.……In the depths of the universe.Li Hao sensed it, too. At this moment, he quickly looked at the stars in the sky. The stars hadn't changed much. They were still flickering with a weak radiance and showed no signs of recovery.In tianfang world, powerful auras swept across the entire world.……Outside of tianfang world.At this moment, the hidden venerable sovereigns also vaguely sensed something. Some of them seemed to have sensed something, and their expressions changed slightly. They quickly contacted the major world Lords through their means.……In the cloud world.Supreme Emperor Yunxiao was still angry at Red Moon master for killing Deepsea. However, it had already happened. He was discussing with Red Moon master how to take revenge and take back Tian Fang ...Suddenly, the Lord of the clouds 'expression changed slightly.""There's been some changes in Tian Fang. It seems like the pressure of a large number of experts has appeared ..." The Crimson Moon Lord raised her brows slightly. Compared to when she was in the Crimson Moon world, she had all sorts of considerations and apprehensions. At this moment, she had less apprehensions and was more flamboyant. She sneered,"Pressure? There are many ... Interesting ... I think I've guessed it. "The cloud Master nodded as well, and his gaze flickered.""Do you want to go and take a look?"Red Moon master looked at him."You're willing to let me go through your great Dao universe?" she asked.Without using the great path universe, even a level eight venerable sovereign would not be able to travel very fast, at least for the primal Chaos. If they used the great path universe, they would be very fast.Cloud Master smiled."I'm just looking ... I control the entire cloud universe. Don't I dare to make a trip to the great Dao universe?"After saying that, he opened the door to the universe.,m The red moon Lord laughed with a profound meaning. 'Cloudsky wants to recruit me? that's wishful thinking. He's a level eight and the master of the red moon. Would he care about such a little trick?'Subdue the hearts of the people?Don't even think about it!He didn't care about cloud sky. In Red Moon Lord's eyes, cloud sky Lord wasn't as good as him.At least he hadn't been deserted by his friends and family. On cloudsky's side, even the second-in-command, Wu Shan, had run away.The two of them didn't say much. Through the Dao universe, they quickly rushed towards Tian Fang.……At the same time.In the world of light, the God of Light frowned. He looked at Yao yang and said in a low voice,""Come with me!"Yao yang looked at him. The God of Light frowned and said,""Maybe ... I caused some trouble! I knew it. Children are too young and don't know anything. The people over there are all very young. The oldest, Wu Shan, was only a Deputy before. He has never really been the master of the world or the master of the great Dao ...""Let's go, the sacred central crypt might have gotten into trouble!"Supreme Emperor Yao yang was a little surprised.What trouble could he cause?There were at least four level 7s and one at the peak of Level 7. In addition, if mingtang and Li Hao joined forces, they could rival an Ordinary Level 7. Although they were not as strong as level 8 worlds, the gap was not big.Under normal circumstances, at this stage, unless Yunxiao and Hongyue joined forces to take a level 8 great world and control it, it would be difficult to break through even if the two of them joined forces!Of course, there was still hope for the other two seventh level venerable sovereigns that he brought along with him ... But if he brought them along, his lair might be raided by others!Even though he wasn't clear about the situation, he still quickly followed after her. He asked with some doubt,""Big brother, what trouble did the sacred central crypt cause?""He might have destroyed tianfang world!"So what?Yao yang didn't understand and asked directly,"so what?" This is an opportuny...To destroy a rank 9 world, the rewards will be great. ""Foolish!"The radiant master was speechless."If the heaven's side could be destroyed so easily, there wouldn't have been a single major world that wanted to seize the heaven's side and integrate it into their own world. Even without a great path universe, it is still incomparable to an ordinary world. Devouring a medium-level world can improve one's strength, let alone a major world!"

Chapter 3094 The Origin Of The World (1)
"This ... Isn't it because tianfang world is at the center of the four-sided domain and the four rank eight worlds are in charge of it? everyone is afraid of each other, so tianfang world has a chance to exist?"Wasn't it?The brilliant sun Supreme Emperor was a little puzzled. In everyone's opinion, that was the case."That's only one of the reasons,"light Thearch quickly replied. If that was the case, our four worlds would have devoured Tian Fang long ago and divided it up!"He frowned."The point is ... Tianfang is a level nine world. The venerable sovereigns who left tianfang might not be dead. They're still alive, including the master of tianfang. Therefore, once tianfang world is destroyed, it will fight back!" It has a certain level of self-protection ability. Not to mention recalling the experts of Tian Fang ... But Tian Fang has a large amount of Taoist connotation. Do you think that's just a casual remark? These Taoist connotation places are all Taoist rites left by venerable sovereigns. If they are still alive, these Taoist connotation places might be activated once they devour the Heaven's Will!"Activate?What did that mean?The next moment, he knew that Tian Fang was right in front of him as he walked out of the great Dao universe.At this moment, the entire tianfang world was filled with countless auras!There was even the aura of a rank eight venerable sovereign!In the distance, the void cracked open and two people walked out. Cloud sky and red Moon looked over. Red Moon master chuckled with a little playfulness. There was no longer any deep hatred from before, only a little teasing."Guangming, it seems like ... This group of people really value your son!"The radiant sovereign was indifferent, ignoring him.He looked at the tianfang world in front of him. The entire world seemed to have been smeared by something and appeared to be deathly gray. However, at this moment, this deathly gray was rapidly fading.The power of Nirvana!He was a rank eight venerable sovereign. He could tell at a glance that this was probably his son's counterattack when the source of the world appeared in the Nirvana land and gave the Taoist connotation some life!He was too bold!The Lord of Light had a slight headache. Of the four rank seven venerable sovereigns left behind, only forest orchid master was a true rank seven Lord of a major world. Most importantly, this forest orchid world had just advanced.He didn't understand what the foundation of Tian Fang's existence was.The master of tianfang didn't die.The source of the world still existed!The entire world was still in operation, and now that it was suffering from a backlash ... Let alone four grade-7 experts, even four more would be troublesome.Why didn't any level 8 world dare to touch Tian Fang?There were only four or five advanced venerable sovereigns in a rank eight world, which was similar to the strength of venerable sword and the others. They were not much stronger. If a rank eight world took the initiative to attack Tian Fang and devour Tian Fang, they might be destroyed!Who would dare to rashly do such a thing? Unless one first controlled the great Dao universe and then suppressed the origin of the world.BOOM!The sword light flickered. Some experts had taken action to suppress those Taoist connotation phantoms.Sword Saint!The powerful attack made Red Moon Lord and the others frown slightly. It was very powerful. The neo martial Swordmaster was indeed a top-notch existence among sword cultivators. His longevity sword will was extremely powerful among those of the same rank. Although he had just advanced to the seventh rank, he was not much weaker than the Yao yang Thearch.The venerable sovereigns were observing from the outside and didn't enter the sky.Although Red Moon master and cloud sky Master were strong, if they went in now ... It would be troublesome if venerable sword and the others did not care and continued to fight with them. As for Kong Ji's backlash, wasn't the radiant master still here?What could the other party do?At this moment, Yun Xiao and Hong Yue looked at each other and sneered.It would be best if the radiant sovereign intervened!At this moment, in order to protect his son, the other party had interfered. He could only fight against those shadows and the source of the entire tianfang world. Once he was entangled ... Hong Yue and Yun Xiao, the two level 8 martial artists, would be of use.Yun Xiao chuckled,"nephew mingtang, you're so bold. You destroyed the entire rank 9 world with your rank 6 body!" A newborn ox is not afraid of a Tiger, and a Tiger father will not beget a dog son!"The radiance Thearch's face was gloomy and cold. He glanced at him and said softly,"Yunxiao, you're so insolent just because you brought in a poor family? Wushan's gone, Deepsea's dead, and Hongyue's a classic fence-sitter. Once you're injured, the first one to kill you might not be the enemy, but this guy ... Don't mess with me, or else I'll pay the price and heavily injure you. It's hard to say whether your cloud world will be yours or not!"  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Red Moon master laughed."Light, there's no need to threaten anyone. If you really dare to start a war, although I'm in decline, I won't let my allies fear me. Internal strife ... This has already happened once. If you dare to attack, so what if I join the cloud world?"Now, cloudsky was afraid of him.However, if he really took the initiative to integrate into the cloud great path universe, the cloud universe's power would increase greatly. Moreover, the Dao master would have a certain degree of control over the venerable sovereigns that had integrated. By then, the cloud Master would probably not be afraid of anything. "Then do you want to try?" the radiant sovereign sneered."What's wrong with trying?"Red Moon master said provocatively.With two level eight venerable sovereigns here, he was not afraid of this guy at all.On the other hand, the cloud Master was not interested in competing with the radiance Supreme Emperor. Hong Yue was just saying it, so he could not take it seriously.He just looked at tianfang world for a while and smiled,""This is bad. A large amount of destructive power has been defeated. It seems ... Nephew mingtang can't resist the backlash of the world origin and is going to be completely suppressed!"The radiant sovereign's expression changed slightly. He could also see that the deathly gray color of the incomparably huge world was currently disappearing. A large amount of life force was beginning to overflow. The Nirvana had failed, and his son was about to suffer the backlash of the type 9 world!

Chapter 3095 The Origin Of The World (1)
These guys ... They were too bold!He was secretly annoyed!"If I had known earlier, I would have warned him. But he didn't expect this to happen. He didn't expect that the other party would seize the heaven's path and give it to his son, Nirvana. He's F * cking speechless.What were the Silver Moon King and the others thinking?After all, this is a tier 9 world, and you're just going to use Nirvana for my son to practice?He looked on deeply, not in a hurry to make a move.It wasn't the final moment yet.Moreover, the two rank eight venerable sovereigns were nearby. He could not act rashly. At this moment, he could only wait and see if venerable sword and the others could suppress the backlash of the entire Tian Fang.There were also some fluctuations in the surroundings. It should be some rank 7 Masters.As for Chi Yang and the Dragon Lord, they didn't seem to have come.It might be to prevent a sudden attack from neo martial.Thinking of new martial, the light Thearch sneered,""If the two of you stay here, aren't you afraid that cloudsky will be broken through?"At this moment, the cloud Master laughed.""Don't be afraid. It doesn't make much sense for neo martial artists to attack Yunxiao. On the other hand, light ... For neo martial artists, it's valuable!"“……”This time, the radiant sovereign didn't try to deny it. He laughed."Why would I? New martial ... Also needs allies. I've communicated with the human King, and we had a good chat. Yunxiao, do you want to know what we've communicated?"The cloud master's expression was a little cold."Be careful not to suffer a backlash. That is a Wolf that can not be tamed!"As for whether the two were in an Alliance, it was unclear.In any case, it was not impossible because the fact that Kong Ji could be here in the Nirvana square represented the approval and tacit approval of new martial arts. Otherwise, how could venerable the sword and Li Zhu let Kong Ji easily destroy the heaven square?The few grade 8 experts were just exchanging words and didn't really attack.They were all observing the situation.At this time, the pressure in tianfang realm had already covered the world!……BOOM!Countless Silvermoon cultivators trembled. When they entered the sky, they didn't notice anything. They only felt that Marchioness Silvermoon was exaggerating. How could there be many experts?But now ... It was said that there was no one left in Tian Fang, which was on the verge of destruction. However, the sudden outburst of countless pressures almost crushed some cultivators below venerable sovereign to death.Fortunately, there were quite a few venerable emperors. At this moment, they quickly released their energy to resist the pressure and the Taoist connotation. This prevented the weak ones from being crushed to death.Liu Yin and the others were in a miserable state.They were quite good at choosing. They chose the eighth-rank Dark Demon Ridge. They thought that since this place was where eighth-rank venerable sovereigns lived, there would be many opportunities. In the end ... It was still fine before. The eighth-rank Dao accumulation had burst forth, and everyone had comprehended many things. They were very satisfied.However, the Dao accumulation that had been suppressed suddenly exploded at this moment. The power of a grade 8 was unbelievably strong. These weaklings were almost crushed to death.At this moment, the light sword, giant pincer, and the other venerable sovereigns were trying to resist the pressure, but they still couldn't fully resist it. The light sword was sweating all over, and his face was pale.This was big trouble!How could it cause the recovery of the Taoist connotation of the entire tianfang land?The origin of the world actually had this ability!Not far away, Kong Ji also roared and the power of Nirvana expanded again. At this moment, shadows from all the Taoist connotation quickly rushed over and suppressed them. It was extremely powerful!The sword light exploded!Over at Lizhu, a Black Book filled the air. Monarch Wushan roared and pressed down with his five fingers. Senlan master's senluo hell appeared!They could also sense the presence of several experts in the outside world.At this moment, they were all deeply worried.No one had expected this.Tian Fang's origin of the world actually had this ability.At that moment, light and darkness suddenly converged, forming a huge Dao domain. The apparition of Tian Fang's light and darkness Oracle instantly merged, forming a Dao domain that trapped the long sword!At the same time, the other five places, including the destroyed Huoxing mountain, suddenly exploded with a wave of pressure. Five waves of energy merged into a colorful Dao domain in the blink of an eye, suppressing Li Zhu's Book of Darkness!The light-darkness Dao domain, the five-element Dao domain!This scene shocked everyone.In the next moment, more illusionary figures appeared. One after another, they started to merge together. The Senlan realm Lord groaned. The expression of the sword Saint also changed. At this moment, a Yin Yang Tai Chi fish seemed to have appeared in the sky.Yin and yang!"Tian Fang still has yin and yang Dao experts?" Kong Ji couldn't help but curse.Before, he had only known about the fifth rank and the light and darkness emissaries. Now, he realized that the Yin Yang emissaries were also probably at the seventh rank. Tian Fang had more seventh rank venerable sovereigns than he had imagined.Fortunately, Wu Shan had not been suppressed. Just as he finished thinking, he cursed in his heart. He really had a jinx.At this moment, waves of pressure surged from all directions. In the blink of an eye, the power of lightning appeared. Like a chaotic lightning tribulation, waves of pressure merged into it, forming a lightning domain that directly crushed Wu Shan's Five Finger Mountain!Sovereign Wushan also snorted and was a little depressed."This is ..."Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?Tian Fang could even be fused into this?Although these Dao accumulations weren't his true body or the peak of venerable heavenly Emperor Tian Fang's cultivation, they suddenly merged into many Dao domains and suppressed several rank seven experts!

Chapter 3096 The Origin Of The World (1)
The power of Nirvana was compressing itself towards Kong Ji ... He was trying to destroy Kong Ji!"Taoist chess, suppress him!" Venerable the sword shouted.There was still a chess piece ... Although ... It might not be of much use.In fact, the virtual chess figure was also extremely solemn at this moment. He said in a deep voice,""I'm an empty shell!"It's that simple, I'm an empty shell.Otherwise, what would I need energy for?He said it in a serious tone, but the words that came out of his mouth made one feel distressed. You're an empty shell ... Why are you speaking so loudly?Venerable the sword no longer held any hope for him and instantly turned his gaze to Li Hao ... At this moment, perhaps only time could suppress him.Otherwise, the void would be finished.Li Hao, on the other hand, was stationed in the depths of the Dao universe. He only looked at the destroyed spatial star and then looked down. He didn't interfere or return. Seeing this, everyone was stunned.Why?Kong Ji, on the other hand, was no longer gentle after cursing for a while. He gritted his teeth and shouted,""Don't worry about me, just suppress the surroundings!"Why do you care about me?At worst ... He would die. This was his original plan. He had thought of leaving immediately, but now, Li Hao had not come out. He was probably waiting for him to die."It's just that ... I don't have enough great Dao energy!Kong Ji was helpless. He hadn't obtained enough Dao crystals yet.Otherwise, he would have just left. Walking the path of life and death was also what he had expected before, but wasn't this because he wasn't prepared?Li Hao, what's the use of guarding that dead planet all the time?Near the Coiling Dragon Well.At this moment, Nan Quan and the others were filled with endless energy and felt like they were about to die. Nan Quan was also extremely distressed. I'm about to enter stage two, but I'm not happy at all!This energy was bursting forth limitlessly. If this continued, he might be able to enter stage three after reaching stage two. After entering stage three ... He would not be able to forcefully advance to stage four because his comprehension was not enough.With this ... He would directly explode!This time, he had really chosen a good place.Nanquan wanted to cry but had no tears!At this moment, he could vaguely see a heart-like thing. It was very huge, and above the heart, there seemed to be many illusionary images. Those were all experts who had walked out of Tian Fang in the past. At this moment, the origin of the world seemed to have presented these shadows.This was the foundation of Tian Fang!Countless powerful venerable sovereigns had walked out!As for the southern Fist, what was even more shocking was that there were countless great Dao crystals around the heart. They had even turned into great Dao Crystal Mineral veins, solidifying and surrounding the entire heart. The uncountable great Dao crystals were the source of the world. The key to why they could quickly bestow power to those phantoms was this.With so many of them ... How long could they last?Venerable the sword said that it could only last for a while, but from Nanquan's perspective, he cursed. This was not just a while. He also saw the great Dao crystals burning wildly. But with so much, it should be enough to burn for a day and a night, right?One day and one night ... It's over!Everyone is finished!Nan Quan raised his head and looked at the great Dao universe. What was Li Hao doing?At this moment, everyone was suppressed, including the two Dao Masters, who were unable to move. Only Li Hao, who had entered the Dao universe, was not suppressed.He could only hope that Li Hao could solve the problem.If he really couldn 't, he could just turn back time!BOOM!In his body, countless great Dao power surged out, and he directly entered the second stage. However, at this moment, he was not happy at all. He could only feel helpless. He would die from overeating. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Old Zhou ... You should take in more ..."In the distance, director Zhou was helpless. At this moment, his aura suddenly rose and he directly stepped into Grade 2. He looked at Nanquan helplessly.I'd like to absorb more ... But I'm the same as you. We're both at our limits after we enter the 3rd rank. Let's see who's going to die first!"He Yong, you'll be the first among us to enter the third stage of the venerable sovereign realm ... Good luck! I wish you the best!"When Nan Quan heard this, he immediately became angry and cursed,""I hope you'll reach the peak of Tier 3 soon!"What a vicious curse!Peak stage three, unable to advance further, would definitely explode! Director Zhou was speechless. This curse was too vicious.For a moment, the entire tianfang seemed to be suppressed by the explosion of the world origin. It was far more troublesome than expected.The key was that the master of Tian Fang's apparition had yet to appear. Once it did ... Everyone would be finished!

Chapter 3097 A Missed Opportunity (1)
Everyone was resisting the Taoist connotation Phantom.Countless shadows appeared in the sky, suppressing everything.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care about them.He was also watching.He sat cross-legged in the depths of the great path universe, his eyes overflowing with divine light. He looked at the faintly emerging origin of the world like a heart.It jumped!As the source of the world throbbed, the world was rapidly recovering. At this moment, the unlucky Kong Ji was about to be destroyed by his own destructive power ... Perhaps he was the first person to be destroyed by his destructive power."So many Dao crystals!"Li Hao murmured. He saw countless great Dao crystals, too many.How much?A few billion?Or tens of billions?At this moment, he really wanted to know how many there were. Thus, he spoke. He sat in the center of the great path universe and his voice shook the world."Martial uncle Nanquan, count how many Dao crystals are there?"è‰¹!Nanquan almost cursed out loud. Can't you just do something serious at a time like this?"Come down and count by yourself!""Come down yourself!" Southern Fist roared."Kill this thing and it's all yours!"At this time, who would be interested in counting this thing?Usually, when they saw a great Dao crystal, they would want to swallow it in one gulp. But today ... It was disgusting, annoying, and too much. The rich energy was about to make them explode.How would I have the time to count?How could he be in the mood to count!Even if his hands cramped from counting money, he still had to live. 'I'm dying. I really feel like I'm about to reach the third stage. Once I reach the third stage, I'll quickly climb to the peak of the third stage ... I might become the first venerable sovereign to explode in history. 'It was too tragic!Other people want it but can't get it, but I'm actually stuffed to death.The key was that he could not escape at this moment. The entire heaven and earth seemed to be suppressed by the illusory figure of the Dragon Tribe Taoist in the Coiling Dragon Well. It was also a precautionary measure in case a powerful figure broke through this place and destroyed the source of the world.Daoist Coiling Dragon of Coiling Dragon Well was a seventh-rank venerable sovereign with a corporeal body. At this moment, the illusory figure was guarding the place as a precaution.Under the situation where venerable the sword and the others were suppressed, these people could not help even if they wanted to."Count!"Li Hao's voice rang out again. Southern Fist cursed, but he still quickly began to investigate and count ... At the side, director Zhou was speechless. Seeing that Nan Quan was really counting, he quickly checked and sensed for a while. He quickly replied,"About 8 billion, if we calculate according to the size of the piece you gave us before."8 billion Yuan!It was a lot!In the sky, Li Hao nodded. Eight billion was a lot. Of course, he had seen the world before. The burning World and the great Dao crystals he had consumed were worth tens of billions.Therefore, he was not too surprised.At this moment, he sat cross-legged in the universe of the great path and sensed the surroundings. After making a judgment, he said,""Director Zhou, help me sense how much Primal Chaos energy this world origin is absorbing and how many great Dao crystals it is transforming into every minute!"Director Zhou frowned.However, he didn't say anything and quickly began to sense it. This origin of the world had been absorbing energy from the chaos. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to meet the maintenance and consumption of a level nine world.One minute?The time was too long!Director Zhou sensed it and after about 10 seconds, he quickly said,""The speed of absorbing the power of Chaos isn't too fast ... Perhaps I can't sense everything. I condensed one great Dao crystal in about 10 seconds ..."It would take a day to become a rank 1 venerable sovereign, but this was a rank 9 world origin. Ten seconds to condense a piece was not too fast.Li Hao quickly calculated and said,""About 3.1 million Yuan a year? "I've seen it before. About one million pieces are consumed every year to maintain the operation of a level nine world, not counting the energy absorbed by cultivators ... Previously, there were many venerable sovereigns in the small domain of 40 square meters. If we were to simply absorb energy every year, there would probably be millions of great Dao crystals consumed ..."Li Hao mumbled to himself,"so, about one million pieces will be left every year?"He could probably maintain this number.If he could maintain this number, he would be able to leave behind 10 billion great Dao crystals in 10000 years.As for Tian Fang, he had disappeared for a million years.Wouldn't he be able to leave behind trillions of great Dao crystals? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This was a huge and shocking number.However, at this moment, there were only about ten billion great Dao crystals left near the source of the world. If no one came to harvest them, no one could harvest them, no top-tier venerable sovereigns absorbed them, and such a destruction had not happened ...Then where did the remaining 900 billion or so great Dao crystals go?After all, there were no venerable sovereigns in Tian Fang.Without the birth of a local venerable sovereign, the great Dao universe would be destroyed. The power of the great Dao that was born, other than the one that was usually dispersed and maintained, should not disappear. Instead, it would be stored near the source of the world.The people below were in a state of desperation, but Li Hao was doing math problems.At this moment, the void was about to be destroyed by itself, but it still maintained enough calmness and quickly said,""Haoyue, what do you want to calculate? In the early years, there was a turmoil in tianfang and someone wanted to take tianfang ... Tianfang world seemed to have protected itself. Of course, I don't know the details, but it should have been quite a big consumption. ""Is the consumption high? How many Dao crystals would I have to burn?""There must be at least ten billion ..."Li Hao nodded. It still didn't match. Even if it was ten billion a time, ten times would be a lot. After many times, it naturally wouldn't be invaded.Those 10 times would only consume 100 billion.

Chapter 3098 A Missed Opportunity (2)
What about the remaining 800 billion? Where did he go?A type 9 world with no one ... Or rather, a type 9 world without any native experts. The world was always in operation, and the great Dao was destroyed. Many great Dao crystals were born, but they were all gone.That was nearly 900 billion worth of Dao crystals!This was not a small amount.It was an astronomical figure!No one seemed to think that there was anything wrong, because no one knew how many great Dao crystals could be produced by a level nine world essence. But now, the world essence had appeared, and according to the speed of absorption, it could produce that many.Ordinary people would be dumbfounded when they saw the ten billion great Dao crystals near the source of the world. Who had the time to care about how fast the other party was absorbing them?No matter how fast it was, one piece was born every 10 seconds. In front of these billions, it was insignificant. Who would really pay attention to it?Moreover, the situation was dangerous. If it wasn't for Li Hao's prestige, the southern Fist and director Zhou would have beaten him so badly that even his master wouldn't recognize him.However, if someone paid attention, they would realize that the numbers did not match.The difference was too great!The origin of the world was still burning the great Dao crystals to suppress many experts. Kong Ji was about to die from the backlash, but Li Hao was still doing simple math problems.If 900 billion great Dao crystals went smoothly, how many venerable sovereigns could they nurture?A lot of them!How many Dao crystals would an ordinary seventh level venerable sovereign consume to reach the seventh level?An anomaly like Li Hao didn't count. He was raising a world, so his consumption was too great. He had spent billions to advance from level four to level five. In this way, it would be an astronomical figure for him to advance to Level Seven.However, people like forest orchid master ... Other than venerable the sword and the others, they were considered a different species."Senior Senlan," Li Hao suddenly said."From the beginning of your cultivation until now, how many Dao crystals have you consumed?"The forest orchid master was also being suppressed and was fighting back. When she heard that, she was stunned.This ... Who would specially calculate this?From level six to Level Seven, he didn't consume too much, probably just over a billion, but that was with the help of the power of the great Dao that was naturally born in the great Dao universe. If not ...From the beginning until now, he had calculated and said,""At least 10 billion!""Then what about the eighth step? I don't care about the Enlightenment, I only care about the consumption for advancement!""I need at least 10 billion more!"A level 8 would be worth at least 20 billion and above.A Grade 7 was worth at least ten billion.If it was the sixth step, it would only take about half of the seventh step. Advancing to the seventh step would be a big deal, so it would be 5 billion.As for those below, they didn't consume much. At Tian Fang's peak, there were probably more than two rank eights. There were probably three to four of them. To cultivate from nothing to rank eight, a few of them together would probably cost hundreds of billions.There were at least 10 rank-7 Tian Fang, and the consumption was also more than 100 billion.There were also a large number of level six venerable sovereigns. There were too many venerable sovereigns Tian Fang. Li Hao kept observing and counting them one by one. Putting aside those that had not been activated or those that had been completely destroyed ... There were hundreds of Dao accumulation lands that had emerged.With so many venerable sovereigns, it would take about 500 billion to cultivate from nothing to this level, which was about 50 times more than Silver moon's previous consumption. Silver Moon did not have any powerful venerable sovereigns, as they were all weak.That was about 700 billion. If he counted the other miscellaneous expenses and the level nine venerable sovereigns ... p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Perhaps, that was enough.The gap of 900 billion was filled.In other words, it would probably take another batch of the same Tian Fang Supreme Emperor to use up all his years of savings.All of these didn't need to be considered the trouble of advancing."Haoyue, I can't hold on much longer ..."At this moment, Kong Ji had no choice but to speak. He wanted to know what Li Hao was planning.Li Hao exhaled and looked at the spatial Dao origin in front of him. It was an incomparably huge destroyed star. This was the Dao origin of the master of Tian Fang, the core of the great Dao. It had been left here.The origin of the world had lost a lot of great Dao crystal energy, and this energy ... Was just enough for all the venerable sovereigns in the entire Dao universe to recover from scratch.There were two possibilities!Firstly, there was a large amount of great Dao crystals in a certain place. It was enough for the entire tianfang world to instantly recover to its peak. The peak when he left back then was an instant recovery, reviving the entire great Dao universe!Second, this great Dao universe had two sides. It was like the Silvermoon universe and the yin-yang universe.On the other side was a complete universe of the great path, which maintained the same peak power.The energy that had been accumulated over the past million years and consumed was just enough for the experts of tianfang world to return in one go!No matter which one it was ... It meant that Tian Fang's experts could return at any time.It was fine as long as his will returned!There was no need to bring energy. As long as the will could return, the other party could be instantly revived. The comprehension of the Dao techniques was there, and the energy was sufficient ... The other party could instantly appear in the great Dao universe and have peak combat power in the blink of an eye!This was a backup plan left behind by the master of Tian Fang?Just in case?It just so happened that in this turbulent period, there was enough energy to return everyone?Many thoughts flashed through Li Hao's mind.Where did they go?Even a level nine venerable sovereign had prepared for the possibility of failure and was ready to bring everyone back ... Had he even prepared for the destruction of his physical body and energy?

Chapter 3099 A Missed Opportunity (3)
But if ... He was killed as soon as he got out, the world origin wouldn't be able to gather so much energy.This would take time to accumulate.A million years!A world without a master would need a million years to gather enough energy for their return.Or was it that from the very beginning, the other party had already made preparations to return a million years later?Why was he able to predict what would happen a million years later?Unless ... The master of Tian Fang had used the river of time to extend to a million years later and saw something. But how was that possible?The other party was the spatial master, not the time master.However ... It was just a simple backtrack or downstream. Backtrack was much simpler. Li Hao had backtracked Tian Fang experts before, so downstream was much more difficult. Moreover, the result wasn't the only one."What?"The next moment, Li Hao was stunned. Yes, backtrack!"I've once turned back time to Taoist Huo Xing and the others. It's been exactly a million years since then. According to my experience of traveling around neo martial, perhaps a powerhouse like the master of Tian Fang had also observed that someone was spying on the world a million years ago. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Following the river, there was no need to spy on anything. One only needed to determine that the person who used time came from a million years in the future!"It just so happens that I've gathered enough energy to return at this time ... Could it be related to me?"Li Hao thought. It was a very narcissistic thought.It's related to me!However, he could not get rid of this thought.This was because he had borrowed the energy of a heaven's side expert a few times, and the key was that the other party had borrowed it all and was very generous.The fire Daoist, the water-element cultivator, and the five-element emissaries all lent their powers to Li Hao easily. The Coiling Dragon Daoist had also explained the great Dao to Li Hao.The other party had also said that if they met again many years later, Li Hao might have to pay a great price to repay them.At this moment, some things appeared in his mind.This was a great price ... How great was the price?Was it related to the return?The master of Tian Fang is such a powerful existence, what else do you need me to do?"Li Hao!"At this moment, Southern Fist shouted in horror,""I'm rank three!"He had never been so afraid of leveling up before. He was so anxious that he called him by his name. Usually, he would pretend to be polite and call him Lord Marquis, but now, he was calling him by his name!What are you doing?Help me! We're almost stuffed to death, aren't you going to come and save us?Even if I'm not stuffed to death, your good friend is empty, and you're about to die too!Aren't you going to save her?At this moment, Li Hao looked at the vast star in front of him and frowned.""Tian Fang is returning? Don't tell me that all the people you brought with you have died in battle, and there are still remnants of their will left. Do you want me to bring them back? If that's the case ... With all due respect, it's too difficult! I don't know where they are ... I can only go back to a million years ago through some Taoist connotation. Don't tell me I need to use some intersection a million years ago to bring them back ... You must be joking!""I only borrowed power twice, once the sixth-tier power, once the seventh-tier power, and listened to the Dao twice ... Don't mess around."Li Hao shook his head.Of course, this was just his own thoughts ... Perhaps he had overestimated himself. The other party had never expected anything from him. He was just overthinking.Or perhaps Tian Fang really did have a second great Dao universe that no one had discovered.The master of Tian Fang only wanted to let the experts of the realm complete the cultivation of two DAOs.The two great Dao universes were waiting for the day they would merge.Once they were united ... They might all have a breakthrough.After coming to this conclusion, Li Hao was very afraid of the destructive universe of the great path. Tianfang was not a good place. Even though he had borrowed power and comprehended the great path here, he was still full of fear at this moment!Somehow, I feel that ... When I first glimpsed pan Long's Dao from the Coiling Dragon well, I might have fallen into the trap of some ancient people millions of years ago.If that was the case ... He had to admit that the other party was really too powerful.Of course, it was also related to his over-reliance on time. Earlier on, he had borrowed strength from this place several times."Li Hao!"Nan Quan was really anxious and roared again.​ Li Hao rolled his eyes and said,"what are you shouting for?" Kong Ji is dying, but he's not as anxious as you! How much time has it saved for you after entering the third rank? You don't know how to be happy, and you're still shouting blindly!"Hearing Li Hao's words, Southern Fist suddenly fell silent.Li Hao wasn't going to leave them in the lurch!So ... It's not too dangerous?The others were relatively quiet. They naturally knew Li Hao's character. He definitely wouldn't leave him be. Since he still hadn't come down, he must have his own plans. Only Southern Fist would make a fuss for no reason.Can't you see that no one is anxious?……At this moment, Li Hao actually had a way to solve the problem in front of him ... In fact, the problem wasn't complicated. At most, he could turn back time. Of course, such a large-scale time reversal might make him go through a fifth life and death Quietus ... That wasn't worth it.Or ... He could destroy some of the Dao stars corresponding to the Taoist connotation by force. He might be able to destroy these Taoist connotation phantoms, but the price might be heavy. The result might be ... He would be targeted!It would be very troublesome if he was targeted by a tier 9!The problem wasn't too big at the moment. The worst was the void, because he lacked enough great Dao crystals. Once he was destroyed by the power of Nirvana, he might not be able to revive because he didn't have enough energy.
