oment, Li Hao made up his mind.
 I'll try it!
 If he failed, then he would advance to the Qian warrior level with his sword force alone. In any case, it would not be worse than his boss 'S. Li Hao felt that it would only be stronger. After all, the source of his sword force was not ordinary.
 After making up his mind and absorbing a large amount of wood energy, Li Hao stood up.
 After a while, Liu Long returned with a bloodied bone.
 "Is there a Scion of the blood God among the people from the Crimson Moon?"
 "There's no hurry. Don't collect it now ... In case the purple Moon finds out something is wrong."
 Even if there were, Li Hao did not plan to collect them now, unless the purple Moon was dead. Otherwise, once the purple Moon noticed something unusual, it would definitely guess something, which would be too troublesome.
 "Boss," Li Hao laughed."I'm looking for a fight with sunlight. How about you help me?"
 "What?"
  "I want to advance!"
 Li Hao said in a low voice,"I want to have a one-on-one fight with riyao. Like sun moxian, I want to merge my power with my inner strength and display my divine intent ... I'm not like you, boss, nor am I a teacher. I'm an experienced Martial Master. I'm too young. If I don't use this method and advance directly ... I'll probably fail!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Everyone was different. Liu Long had also accumulated many years of experience, but he was too young. If he were to advance directly, his chances would not be high.
 "I think I need to make use of the momentum from killing sunlight." Li Hao laughed."I need to become an invincible warrior of the Qian dynasty!"
 Liu Long was silent for a moment before he said,""Even sunlight isn't weak, but you've broken through a hundred ..."
 "I'm from the five birds sect!"
 Li Hao laughed,"moreover, I know the ninth refinement force and the Shadowless Sword!" Before this, I even killed sun moxian, who was about to advance. To be honest, the battle with him has a huge impact on me. I feel that I'm transforming into an invincible Martial Master!"
 "Alright!" Liu Long took a deep breath and nodded,"alright, but I suggest that you fight with earth, water, and wood elements ..."
 "Whoever I find counts. Just the early stage of the sunlit realm will do. I'm not picky!"
 After saying that, Li Hao looked around to see if there was a soloist, a soloist, or a few dark moons.
 This Street didn't seem to have one.
 A few thousand meters ahead, there were a few balls of light. It was too far, and he was too lazy to go.
 Looking at the neighboring Street, Li Hao's eyes flickered."I think there's a sunshine guy over there ... I wonder who he is. It's fine if he's from swords gate, but if it's anyone else ... We'll just kill him!"
 The swords gate had at least given him a sword. Li Hao was quite tactful.
 Liu Long didn't say anything, and the three of them quickly went to the next street.
 ……
 At that moment, the entire outer city was filled with the battle between the black armors and the supers, as well as the battle between the supers.
  There were also some people waiting outside the ancient house, waiting for the bronze-armored warriors, ready to kill them.  Of course, there were also some people who had been hiding in the dark, wanting to see if there was anything they could take advantage of.
 The eighth Street.
 In a small alley, between two walls, a black figure supported himself with his legs, silently waiting for his prey to take the bait.
 Darkness enveloped his body.
 He had been through the second passage and his super waves were blocked. He was even more hidden in the darkness.
 As a sunbeams powerhouse, he had a dark power. The city's environment was unique to him. If it were not for the superwaves, he would have been able to live in peace. Unfortunately, the superwaves were a big problem, so he could not get too close to the opponent.
 However, ever since he entered the second passage, his powers were concealed. He realized that this was the world of the dark element!
 He, who was from the flying organization, also had a mission this time.
 Fei Tian's mission was very simple ... To kill more people.
 Whether it was the night patrollers, the other two from the three major organizations, or the Rogue cultivators of swords gate ... All he had to do was kill as many as he could.
 Fei Tian's goal had always been very strange, and their actions were also very strange. They were more like assassins. Sometimes, they would kill anyone, and sometimes, they would help anyone. If it wasn't for Fei Tian's strength, such an indecisive organization would have long been destroyed by the Joint Forces.
 For Fei Tian to be able to survive until today, she naturally had her own unique points.
 Meanwhile, flying sky had absorbed a large number of dark-type powerhouses. 80% of the dark-type powers in the superpower domain had been absorbed by flying sky, making them look even more mysterious and strange.
 Flying sky was very low-key, but it was classified as a dark power organization. This was one of the reasons. They killed people randomly without a clear target. Therefore, not only did the night patrolman label them as a dark power organization, but Red Moon and Yama had also excluded flying sky from their cooperation targets.
 In the field of superpowers, they preferred to see it as an independent assassin organization.
 Just as this person was thinking about this, his ears twitched slightly. Someone was coming.
  In the dark, a figure entered from the end of the alley.
 "The target is here!"
 He was secretly happy.
 At this moment, the face slowly appeared in the darkness. The expert in the sky frowned when he saw it. Li Hao?
 Over a hundred!
 This wasn't the point. The key was that the other party's identity was special. One of the eight great families 'successors, including Fei Tian, had once said that if they encountered Li Hao, they should try not to kill him directly. Instead, they should interrogate him for some information.
 Of course, if they could capture Li Hao alive, that would be the best result.
 The man was considering whether to let Li Hao go. After all, it was unrealistic to catch him here ...
 However, Li Hao was getting closer and closer. When he was about ten meters away, Li Hao suddenly said,""Your Excellency seems to be a flying expert. Aren't you tired of climbing walls? It's dangerous to climb too high. Why don't you come down and let me see the power of the sunlight?"
 He hoped to have a head-on battle with sunlight. Otherwise, if he launched a sneak attack, this guy might not be able to react in time.

 At this moment, the flying expert's heart trembled. He instantly landed on the ground and turned around to leave.
 They preferred to move in the dark.
 If they were discovered, they would retreat.
 This was also a decisive move. Even if the other party was only above 100 and was discovered, he was not willing to fight head-on.
 Just as he was about to leave, a sword aura exploded behind him!
 "Did you ask me before you left?"
 "You're looking for death!"
 The flying sun glory's expression changed. A person who had broken through a hundred actually dared to take the initiative to attack him. Although the other party had killed sun moxian, breaking through a hundred was still breaking through a hundred, not fighting a thousand!
 In an instant, he turned around and retaliated. A small sword appeared in his hand, and he thrust it at Li Hao's throat.
 Fast, accurate, ruthless, and well-hidden!
  This was the characteristic of a dark element assassin.
 Clang!
 With a crisp sound, Li Hao blocked the small sword with his sword, but he was forced to take a few steps back. He raised his eyebrows slightly. Sunlight was indeed much more powerful than Yue Ming.
 This was also his first time fighting a sunlit expert on his own. Previously, Liu Long or his teacher had only intervened, while Li Hao had only played a supporting role.
 Li Hao didn't say anything. He simply waved his sword!
 The sword momentum exploded!
 At the same time, he stomped on the ground and a rich terrain emerged.
 "What?"
 The flying expert was shocked. What was going on?
 He seemed to see the ground moving up and down ... Was this momentum?
 But ... The other party was using sword force. This was something he knew.
 "Two types of Shi?"
 In an instant, he understood something.
 Yuan Shuo was famous for his ability to fuse five types of Shi, and his disciple had actually comprehended two types of Shi!
 No wonder this guy dared to fight him.
 "Hehe, I won't play with you anymore ... You're indeed a genius. What a pity ..."
 Buzzzzzz!
 The sound of a sword rang out. Li Hao didn't say anything. He simply thrust his sword forward, stopping the other party from leaving. Li Hao calmly said,""When martial masters fight, one of them will die. If he doesn't die ... You probably won't be able to leave!"
 In an instant, the two of them exchanged blows again.
 In the darkness, a small sword kept appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Li Hao tilted his head to avoid it, stabbed out with the sword, and then turned around to kick out. In the alley, a sunlight martial artist and a hundred-plus Martial Master were instantly entangled.
 This sunlight was not going to leave!
 Perhaps, he would not be able to leave.
 It seemed that Li Hao wanted to fight him one-on-one ... So he would kill Li Hao first, because he sensed that there was someone outside the alley.
 At this moment, he finally understood.
 This person might have regarded him as Li Hao's stepping stone.
 He was quite bold!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After I kill Li Hao, I'll make you regret it.
  Stab, a silent assassination.  Li Hao's sword momentum changed. Without a sound, he also used the Shadowless Sword.
 The two swords were constantly clashing.
 Li Hao's sword was extremely sharp. It was a heaven-splitting sword move, but Li Hao had only comprehended the tip of it. Even so, every time he slashed out, his opponent's hair would stand on end.
 And this person's sword was very strange. It often attacked from unbelievable angles and almost stabbed Li Hao a few times.
 The two of them continued to cross paths and change directions.
 With a pfft, a sword entered his body.
 Li Hao was the first to be injured. His arm had been pierced by a sword so deep that the bone could be seen.
 He didn't care and threw a punch like a tiger pouncing. He held the sword in his right hand and threw a punch with his left hand. He forced his opponent back with one punch and then swung his sword again!
 The Shadowless Sword was also invisible. After attacking more than ten times in a row, Li Hao suddenly took a deep breath and then spat it out!
 With a plop, the Qi sword directly pierced through the other party's shoulder.
 "Hmph!"
 "Hmph!" A muffled groan sounded as the dazzling sunlight trembled slightly. It wasn't that he had never seen a Martial Master over a hundred before, but it was extremely rare to see a Martial Master over a hundred that could match the dazzling sunlight.
 Or rather, he knew that only a few old martial masters who had comprehended Shi for many years could do this.
 Li Hao was too young!
 Li Hao didn't care about this. At this moment, he only had one thought in his mind. If he killed this guy, he might be able to advance ... If he couldn 't, then he would try the heaven-earth destroyer.
 He used the sunlight as a target to test if his Shi could be fused.
 Li Hao suddenly felt a little regretful.
 This guy ... Didn't feel too strong.
 Yes!
 He felt that even if he didn't attempt to advance, if he were to continue fighting with the other party ... He might not necessarily lose.
 The early stage of the sunlit realm ... Was just so-so!
 Li Hao, who had two types of Shi, felt that he was not weaker than him.
 "This guy, can he force me to use my sword force to break the terrain?"
 Li Hao frowned. If he couldn't use it, it might not be a good thing.
 Just as he was thinking about this, the dark-element powerhouse opposite him seemed to be angry and even anxious because his shoulder had been pierced!  His plan to kill Li Hao easily had been dispelled.
  Originally, he had wanted to save his strength to deal with the people outside, but now ... It seemed that Li Hao was more difficult to deal with than he had imagined!
 "You're courting death!"
 With a cold snort, the next moment, a dark energy spread out. In the blink of an eye, Li Hao and Liu Long were both pulled into a dark ball of light. Even Liu Long, who was outside, didn't feel anything wrong.
 But at this moment, Li Hao felt that something was wrong.
 He felt as if he had been enveloped by darkness and had even fallen into a dark quagmire. He felt as if he was surrounded by cotton.
 In the next moment, a sword was thrust at his throat.
 Li Hao's reaction was slower than before. He tried to block the attack with his sword ... But he was too slow. The next moment, the thin sword was aimed at his throat again.
 Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he was somewhat delighted.
 I was wondering why he was a little weak. So that's how it was. He actually held back earlier!
 Seeing the sword coming, Li Hao's inner strength fluctuated, and a faint divine intent appeared at his throat. With a clang, the sword was blocked, but a small bloody mark was still left on Li Hao's throat.

 This was what he wanted!
 Li Hao was overjoyed. This was the opponent he had hoped to meet, a fatal threat to him!
 The two of them exchanged blows once more, and the dark-type expert became more and more shocked.
 He was no longer holding back, but he still couldn't take down Li Hao. This guy seemed to be getting braver the more he fought!
 The two of them kept fighting in the darkness. Bloody wounds were left on Li Hao's body, but Li Hao was getting more and more excited. He kept trying to coordinate the terrain with his sword force.
 Even though he was a little rusty, he still tasted the sweetness of it.
 In his mind, the scene of the black armored Army forming their battle formation appeared again.
 He defended with his shield. While he was defending, he would activate his shield, thrust his spear, and thrust his sword ... That was also a form of attack and defense.
 Very strong!
 A group of Black Phoenix even blocked a group of three suns.
  Later on, if it weren't for the fact that the black Vatican's formation had been broken through by a pincer attack, it wouldn't have been so easy to capture them.
 "The moment the defense is gone ... It's time to attack!"
 "Attacking is also a form of defense ... Killing the enemy is naturally also a form of defense ..."
 Li Hao comprehended the coordination and fusion of Shi according to his own understanding.
 Must the sword break the heaven and earth?
 Not necessarily!
 Did the spear and the sword break the shield?
 No!
 Cooperation didn't necessarily need to be broken.
 At this moment, Li Hao had a deeper understanding of the two forces.
 The terrain disappeared, and the sword force instantly emerged. With a slash, it left a bloody mark on the opponent's body. The dark element expert was shocked!
 He felt that Li Hao was getting stronger and stronger!
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was immersed in this kind of cooperation, his heart full of joy.
 "The terrain contains sword force, and sword force contains the terrain. Earth-wrapped sword?"
 Li Hao thought of a phrase, and then thought of the earth element experts. Some people would use earth spikes, which would suddenly pop out of the earth and stab someone to death!
 At this moment, the terrain suddenly changed. It was as if a sword had grown out of the ground. Li Hao, who had been defending, suddenly attacked!
 With a pfft, he left another bloody mark on his opponent's body!
 The dark-element powerhouse was even more shocked. At this moment, he even had the urge to escape.
 This guy ... Is he going to advance to the thousand warrior stage?
 He wanted to escape!
 He moved his body and was about to escape.
 However, at this moment, a powerful terrain appeared, and there seemed to be an invisible wall around them.
 The next moment, Li Hao took a step forward and slashed out.
 At the same time, the invisible walls around him seemed to have many sharp spikes.
 They all charged at the dark-type expert!
 Seeing that he couldn't escape, the other party let out an angry roar and stabbed at Li Hao. This attack was also just right, and it happened to be blocked by an empty space.
 But at this moment, a wall seemed to have appeared on Li Hao's sword.
  He thrust his sword forward ... But his sword seemed to have sunk into a swamp, unable to go any deeper.  Li Hao swung his sword and cut off his opponent's arm with a pfft!
 "Hiss ..."
 An Ying couldn't believe what he was hearing. He looked at Li Hao in shock. What was this?
 Li Hao was particularly happy at this moment. He didn't care what the other party thought.
 He swung his sword again and again. At this time, his sword momentum was like the power of the earth, continuous and attacking from all directions.
 Puchi!
 In an instant, it left a trail of blood on his body.
 Seeing that his opponent was in great pain and about to roar, Li Hao's eyes flickered, and the next moment, the momentum of his sword changed.
 It seemed to be extremely vigorous!
 It was as if Mount Tai was pressing down on him. However, the powerful aura around the sword was mixed with a special sharp force that could destroy everything!
 Sword force and terrain!
 The terrain increased strength. Who said that the earth could only be used for defense?
 The ground could also be attacked!
 This sword was similar to the earth element's heavy earth, but it also contained an indomitable destructive force!
 BOOM!
 The moment the sword was drawn, a rumbling sound was heard. The sword light also instantly covered the dark shadow.
 At the end of the alley, Liu Long heard the sound and looked over with his eyes wide open.
 It was as if a heavy mountain was pressing down from the sword light. This mountain was a mountain of daggers and a sea of flames!
 Kachaa!
 The terrain directly pressed down on the other party, causing him to half-kneel on the ground in extreme pain. The next moment, the sword light flickered, and with a PU chi sound, the other party was split into two!
 Li Hao didn't stop after killing his opponent.
 Instead, he swung his sword again and the sword of Mount Tai reappeared.
 He slashed out with his sword!
 With a loud bang, a shallow mark was left on the ground, which quickly began to repair.
 Li Hao took a step forward, and his sword momentum and terrain erupted as he charged straight at Liu Long.
 Liu Long frowned slightly. In the next moment, a wave swept over.
 This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In an instant, the wave and the sword of Mount Tai collided.
 With a loud bang, the waves were extinguished, and Mount Tai collapsed.
 Liu Long grunted, and Li Hao also grunted.
 The next moment, Li Hao swung his sword again, and Liu Long punched out. He knew that Li Hao felt that it wasn't enough ... Just like how he had needed Yuan Shuo to add fuel to the fire when he had advanced.
 At this moment, he didn't mind giving Li Hao a push.
 But ... He was having a hard time.
 p It was easy for Yuan Shuo to hit him, but for him to hit Li Hao ... It was too F * cking uncomfortable.  With a bang, the three forces collided again.
 Liu Long stomped on the ground and kept retreating. He was a little angry. The next moment, nine waves stacked on top of each other. In one go, they directly engulfed the sword of Mount Tai, shattering the mountain and obliterating the sword Qi!
 In the next moment, Li Hao slashed out again and again!

 How could the waves destroy the earth?
 Buzzzzzz!
 Bang! Bang! Bang! The nine-layered waves still couldn't destroy Li Hao's sword of Mount Tai. Instead, they became weaker and weaker. In the blink of an eye, Li Hao had slashed more than ten times!
 With a loud bang, Hong long, Liu Long stomped on the ground. This time, he was forced to retreat more than ten steps, and even crashed into a building on the other side, almost crashing into the ancient house.
 Pfft!
 After spitting out a mouthful of blood, Liu Long's face was filled with shock. After the shock ... He was unable to accept it and collapsed.
 How was that possible?
 Li Hao ... Even if I've advanced to the Qian warrior class, I'm still new to it. I've advanced for a few days, and I'm still a veteran Martial Master.
 On the other side, Li Hao woke up.
  Seeing Liu Long spit out blood ... His expression changed slightly. In the next moment, he bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood. He gasped for breath and said,""Boss ... Amazing ... His internal organs ... Are injured!"
 He panted heavily and spat out another mouthful of blood."If I didn't strengthen my five internal organs ... This nine refinements force ... Would have shattered my internal organs ... Boss ... You ... You're too cruel!"
 Liu Long looked at him suspiciously. Really?
 Li Hao panted."Boss ..." He said quickly,"hurry up and carry me ... Let's go. It's too loud ... Someone will sense it ..."
 "Alright!"
 Liu Long suppressed the suspicion in his heart and quickly stepped forward to carry him. He whispered, "You're injured?"
 "En!"
 "Have you advanced?"
 "You can say so!"
 The advancement of Qian warrior did not cause much of a stir. It was the same for all martial masters. Their power came from the inside to the outside, and the changes were only within the body. However, the advancement of superpower caused a big stir. The superpower lock broke, and the clatter did not stop.
 For example, Wang Ming's promotion to sunlit had caused a great stir.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As for Li Hao, Yuan Shuo, and Liu Long, they didn't cause much of a commotion. They usually entered the Qian warrior realm in an instant, and their auras and divine will gathered.  At this moment, Liu Yan also ran over quickly and said in a low voice,""Li Hao, why did you hit boss?"
 "It's not that I hit boss ... It's just that I don't have enough pressure to advance ... I need boss's strength to stimulate my aura to change! Boss is too strong, he's injured my internal organs ... Retreat!"
 Hearing him say this, Liu Long felt a little embarrassed.
 However, he was still suspicious.
 Did I?
 Damn it, I think I was injured by you. Why are you more injured?
 Could it be that he was injured when he fought with an Ying?
 "Your fusion of two powers is very powerful ... I didn't expect you to succeed so quickly ... Li Hao, I think ... You ... You might be able to surpass me very soon."
 Very soon?
 He wasn't sure himself, but he could only suppress it in his heart.
 This kid wasn't a good person. Even if they asked him, he might not tell them.
  Li Hao, who was being carried on his back, smiled.
 Fortunately, I acted quickly. Otherwise, boss would probably be so angry now.
 He was still reminiscing about what had just happened. The sword of Mount Tai was his own name. It was as heavy as Mount Tai, but it was also extremely sharp. That feeling ... It might really not be difficult to kill riyao!
 At this moment, Li Hao felt that he was overconfident.
 Don't be arrogant, keep a low profile!
 "Teacher has combined Five Forces. He can kill three suns when he enters the thousand warrior stage. I'm just a piece of trash compared to him. I can only kill a mid-stage sunlit glory expert now. It's hard to even kill a late-stage sunlit glory expert now. In comparison ... Forget it, I'll continue to work hard!"
 Of course, it was a little weak to carry his boss.
 Fighting a thousand with one force alone felt ... Felt quite weak!
 Li Hao felt a little helpless. Boss was so weak. He had to give him some face in the future. He couldn't show that he was stronger than him in front of others, or he might not be able to take it.

 Lying on Liu Long's back, Li Hao was still reminiscing.
 The most obvious feeling after advancing to the Qian dynasty was that he could move his force at will.
 In other words, it was divine intent!
 Force and divine intent were actually the same concept.
 However, in the period of breaking 100, it was only called momentum. When it came to fighting Qian, Yuan Shuo and the others liked to call it divine intent.
 The momentum was like a god, and the will moved the God.
 Before this, Li Hao always liked to stomp his feet when activating Earth Force. It wasn't because he liked this, but because stomping his feet could better connect to Earth Force.
 When he attacked, he also liked to recall the sword he saw that day, because only by recalling could he activate the sword power.
 And all of this actually required a certain amount of time.
 Of course, this was a very short time.
  ? Under normal circumstances, it would not delay anything.
 However, if the enemy understood you, the moment you stomped your foot, the other party might take the opportunity to interrupt you.
 When he reached the thousand warrior tier, Li Hao realized that he didn't need it anymore.
 With a single thought, Shi was activated.
 This was the divine decree!
 Not only that, Li Hao had many other feelings and discoveries.
 After stepping into the thousand warrior tier, it seemed as if the bottleneck had been broken through. Previously, the maximum amount of inner strength was the limit, but now, the limit had been broken, and the body began to produce inner strength again.
 At this moment, Li Hao could even feel some shackles in his body, which were the so-called super locks.
 He could vaguely feel that these super locks had locked many parts of his body.
 The divine decree was still slowly transforming.
 Li Hao closed his eyes and experienced it in silence.
 Liu Long was carrying him on his back, avoiding some supers and walking carefully. He could even hear some movements from the place where they had just fought.
 They were probably fighting for the mysterious energy left behind by the shadow expert.
 Liu Long and Li Hao didn't take it away because they wanted to buy some time. It turned out that when people saw hundreds of mysterious people in front of them ... No one would ignore them, and no one would continue to pursue the enemy in the dark.
 Who would give up on a ready-made mystical energy?
 The experts who had rushed over had probably already launched an attack and were fighting.
 It was not rare to see such a fight in the streets of the outer city.
 He didn't know how many people would still be alive by the time they met up at the inner city gate.
 Liu Long jogged all the way to the edge of the square. He didn't go near the square, but stopped at the edge. There were fewer people here, because if a battle were to break out here, the people guarding outside would be easily discovered.
  "How is it now?"  Liu Long asked in a low voice,"is the injury that serious?"
 He had been a little suspicious before, but now he wondered if Li Hao had really been seriously injured.
 Douqian Martial Master had a strong recovery ability.
 Li Hao didn't say anything. Instead, he silently experienced the strength of his five internal organs.
 Among the five internal organs, his heart was slightly stronger. In addition to the mysterious energy that his teacher had given him, his heart had absorbed about 500 cubic meters of fire energy.
 Then, it was the spleen, kidney, earth energy, and water energy. Because he had killed the earth-type li Dahu and the 150 cubic meters of water energy given by the reincarnation King, the two had absorbed about 400 cubic meters.
 His liver and lungs corresponded to the wood and metal energy, but at this moment, they had absorbed less. They had absorbed about 300 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
 Li Hao had spent about 1800 cubic meters of mysterious energy on his five internal organs.
 In addition, he had also absorbed some wind energy, lightning energy, and some attribute-less mysterious energy. In total, he had absorbed more than 2000 cubic meters.
 That was a terrifying number!
 Even for the three major organizations and the night watchmen, 2000 cubic meters was not too difficult for them. However, it was almost impossible for one person to consume it.
 Of course, if the other party could guarantee that he could enter the universe of warrior quickly ... The major organizations would probably not have any objections.
 2000 units to create a warrior master ... No one would have any objections.
 "The balance can't be maintained, and the fire energy is the strongest ..."
 There were more fire element cultivators, and Li Hao couldn't do anything about it. Among the supers he had encountered, there were quite a few fire element ones. For example, Qiao Feilong from three suns, as well as several of Qiao Feilong's sunshine subordinates, were mostly fire element supers.
 Hao lianchuan and sun Yifei also had the fire element.
 Li Hao opened his eyes and looked at Liu Long."Boss, Yama gave you 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy. Take a look. How much is the metal-elemental and wood-elemental energy?"
 After Liu Long returned, Li Hao gave him these.
  The other party had given him three types of mysterious energy, metal, wood, and earth, but he had not given him water and fire. That rotation was also a wonder.
 Liu Long had seen it before, but it wasn't too accurate. He could only make a general judgment. At this moment, he said,"Metal-type is about 100 cubic meters, wood-type is less, about 40 cubic meters, and earth-type is about 60 cubic meters."
 Most of them were metal-type, and he might have picked up the corpse of a metal-type sunlit expert.
 "Boss, lend me 200 cubic meters. I'll return it to you later ..."
 For the time being, Liu Long didn't need to balance his five internal organs. He was still nourishing his kidney. Li Hao hoped to borrow it, especially the metal element. Currently, the metal element and the earth element were not balanced, which meant that his sword force and terrain were also not balanced.
 If he obtained this 100 cubic meters, the metal-type and earth-type would have absorbed about 400 cubic meters of mysterious energy each, and they would be able to reach a balance.
 Li Hao and Yuan Shuo were different.
 Yuan Shuo's Five Forces were in balance, so it wouldn't be a problem for him to strengthen all of them or even one of them. As for Li Hao, he might need to accumulate two forces at the same time.
 Liu Long didn't say anything. He just threw a few bones to Li Hao.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao looked into the distance. The entire outer city was still shrouded in darkness. He wasn't too interested in participating in this. He would focus on strengthening his five internal organs first.

 After absorbing all this mysterious energy, his sword energy might be completely exhausted.
 Next, he could only rely on slowly nurturing.
 Or ... He could get some clones of Blood God. The effects of the clones of Blood God were actually not bad. They had the effect of overall strengthening. Although they were not as specific as the five elements, they could be quickly digested without sword energy.
 The small sword on his waist was emitting a faint light.
 Li Hao began to absorb again.
 As soon as he stepped into the thousand warrior tier, his endurance was stronger, and his digestion speed was faster.
 With a stronger body, the burden was even greater.
 When he absorbed the mysterious energy before, he felt full. This time, he quickly swallowed dozens of cubic meters of metal-elemental energy, but he didn't feel much.
 His lungs had also been strengthened.
 After about half an hour, Li Hao had used up all his metal-type energy.
  He began to absorb the wood energy, but he didn't plan to absorb the earth energy for the time being. Otherwise, this temporary balance would be broken again.
 He had just absorbed less than ten cubic meters ...
 Li Hao opened his eyes, a little disappointed.
 The sword energy ... Was gone!
 Although he already knew that there was only a little bit left and it would be used up very soon.
 However, he was still a little disappointed when it was suddenly gone.
 Sword energy was the reason why he was able to advance to the Qian warrior realm so quickly. It could be said that without sword energy, Li Hao would not have been able to advance so quickly.
 But now, the sword energy was exhausted.
 As for the stone gate ruins, he could replenish it, but ... The rate of dissipation was not fast. He was able to absorb so much last time because of the accumulation over a long time.
 It had only been a few days since Li Hao last absorbed the energy.
 Although his teacher had said that there might be eight stone doors, his teacher had been exploring the Silver City for a few days, but he had not found a second ruin. Before he could continue exploring, he had gone into seclusion to rest his spirit. Until now, his teacher had also disappeared.
 Thus, Li Hao couldn't find an effective way to replenish his energy.
 "AI!"
 Sighing imperceptibly, Li Hao didn't argue.
 It was still alright!
 At this moment, his lungs and spleen had absorbed about 400 cubic meters of energy, and his kidney had also absorbed about the same.
 These three internal organs had reached a small balance.
 The wood energy was slightly less and the fire energy was slightly more, so the impact wasn't too great.
 Li Hao began to consider ... Whether he should rest his spirit at this moment?
 First, he had to nurture the sword force and the terrain. He didn't know if the other three internal organs could withstand it.
 The accumulation of spirit required a process. During this process, the divine intent could still be used. However, when it was used, it was easy to break the balance and bring a huge burden to the five internal organs.
  His teacher had absorbed over a thousand cubic meters of fire energy before he was able to successfully store the heart fire ape's spirit.  Li Hao didn't expect immediate success, but the nurturing process was also a way to strengthen his momentum.
 "Teacher's heart is the only thing that's strong. His other organs are not as good as mine ... Under such circumstances, teacher still dared to forcefully channel his Tiger aura and even let it break through ... My five organs are not weaker than teacher's overall!"
 Thinking of this, he turned to Liu Long,""Boss, help me take a look. I'm going to cultivate for a while. If anything abnormal happens, I won't say anything. You don't have to worry about me."
 Liu Long frowned slightly, but he still nodded.
 A moment later, Li Hao closed his eyes again.
 This time, he tried to integrate the terrain into his spleen. The earth was more tolerant, so it might be easier.
 His will followed his heart!
 Just as Li Hao had this thought, the force of the earth appeared in his spleen. Yuan Shuo's five birds force presented five kinds of beasts, while Liu Long's ninth refinement force, sea wave force, presented waves.
 On the other hand, Li Hao's terrain was a mountain.
 The mountains could not represent the earth.
 It could only be said that Li Hao's current focus was on this. It was considered a type of heavy earth element, not the entire earth. He couldn't display the boundless Earth Force unless he reached a higher level.
 A mountain instantly entered his spleen.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
 A loud sound resounded in Li Hao's ears and his heart. A huge pressure instantly exploded in his spleen. It shook and even began to bleed.
 Li Hao's face turned pale!
 However, with Yuan Shuo's guidance and experience, Li Hao knew how to deal with it. This was the effect of having a good teacher. At this moment, he did not panic.
 Li Hao observed the spleen with his divine will. A moment later, he seemed to have discovered something.
 With a single thought, the huge mountain peak smashed into a chain in the world inside his spleen. It was the Super Lock!
 Subduing the terrain!
 Just like how Yuan Shuo had subdued the heart fire ape, his heart was not strong enough to subdue it. In the end, he had to work together with Yuan Shuo to suppress the heart fire ape.
  At this moment, Li Hao was going to do the same. He was going to use the power of the Super Lock to lock the mountain.
 The premise was that your superpower lock had to be stronger than your Shi!
 Once the power of the Super Lock was weakened and the mountain broke the Super Lock, one would either die or become a super ... In the past, martial masters yearned to become a super, but now, Li Hao was not willing.
 Even if he would become stronger after becoming a super ... That was not his Dao.
 Hualala!
 In his ears, there was a faint sound of chains. From his spleen, a thick chain was rapidly moving towards mountain. Although mountain wasn't as violent as the heart fire ape and was resisting fiercely, he was still constantly shaking!
 Li Hao felt extremely uncomfortable with each shake, and blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.
 His other four internal organs were also shaking.
 No wonder his teacher said that his other internal organs had to be strong as well. Otherwise, there was a risk of his four internal organs exploding.
 On that day, his teacher spent a week to finally subdue the heart fire ape ... Of course, his teacher's subduing was different from Li Hao 'S. Li Hao could only temporarily lock in his momentum, while his teacher could break out of it.

 Moreover, it was his teacher's first attempt, and he had spent most of his time strengthening his heart.
 Li Hao strengthened his five organs on a daily basis.
 At this moment, it was the final stage, force-lock!
 ……
 Beside him, Liu Long watched silently.
 He seemed to have understood something.
 As a Qian fighter, he roughly knew what Li Hao was doing at this moment.
 Li Hao, who had just stepped into the thousand warrior tier, began to gather his spirit ... He recalled Yuan Shuo's words about strengthening the kidney and the five internal organs.
 Li Hao's five internal organs had obviously become extremely powerful.
 So ... This grandson's claim that his internal organs were injured ... Was all nonsense.
  This kid was very bad!
 However, Liu Long was not in the mood to care about this. He watched in silence. Watching was also a form of cultivation. Li Hao had asked him to be his Dao protector and was accumulating spirit energy in front of him. Clearly, he had no intention of hiding anything.
 "Accumulating spirit, power enters the five internal organs. I can faintly hear the sound of chains ... And the heart fire ape is also carrying chains ..."
 The chains ...
 He thought of something, the superpower lock!
 "Super Lock, locking the force into the five internal organs? Now that the terrain has exploded, will it enter the spleen?"
 He observed carefully. Sure enough, Li Hao's spleen was bleeding a little, and it was even seeping out.
 How strong were Li Hao's internal organs?
 He didn't know, but he knew that it was definitely much stronger than his own. And Li Hao couldn't even withstand it. His face was pale, and he couldn't subdue the terrain.  "So ... I'm afraid my five internal organs can't take it!"
 Liu Long frowned slightly. This was very troublesome.
 However, the nurturing of the five internal organs required a long process.
 "Should I use the Scion of the blood God to strengthen them all, or ..."
 He looked at Li Hao and quickly shook his head.
 Li Hao obviously hadn't been strengthened to the extreme.
 In fact, he had guessed something. Li Hao's ability to strengthen his five internal organs so quickly had something to do with the sword in his hand. However, Li Hao had just absorbed wood energy and gave up after a while. He had clearly reached a bottleneck.
 The help that the sword had brought ... Seemed to have disappeared.
 Otherwise, the injured Li Hao would have only needed to quickly absorb the energy, just like when they sparred. He would have been able to recover quickly, but Li Hao didn 't.
 "So, without that special energy, this kid has no choice but to accumulate his spirit right now. Otherwise, he should wait until he can completely withstand it before he does so!"
 Liu Long had been a team leader for many years, so he could still understand some basic logic.
 Yuan Shuo had said that he was stupid ... That was because Yuan Shuo was too arrogant.
 Who dared to say that Liu Long's brain wasn't working well?
 In a short moment, he had determined many things, including that Li Hao's life-saving energy had probably been exhausted. He could tell that too, so he felt a little regretful.
 No more!
 In this case, whether it was getting injured or recuperating ... It would be a very troublesome matter!
 "Pfft!"  Just as he was thinking, Li Hao spat out a mouthful of blood. Liu Long was about to move, but he recalled Li Hao's words. Unless he said something, there was no need to care. He stopped the worried Liu Yan and shook his head.
 At this moment, Li Hao was fighting against the mountain.
 Suppression!
 It was difficult to lock the chain. The huge mountain kept shaking. Every time it shook, Li Hao had a feeling that ... If it continued shaking, the chain would break.
 "Teacher said ... Once the chain is out, it will be much easier to suppress ... Is my superpower lock not strong enough?"
 Li Hao thought that he had been too anxious.
 However, he had no choice.
 If he didn't lock down his momentum now that his sword energy was gone, was he going to wait until his sword energy was replenished?
 There was no need!
 Seeing that the situation was getting more and more intense, Li Hao felt that he might not be able to seal the mountain if this continued. His initial spirit accumulation would end in failure. Not only would he gain nothing, but his five internal organs would also be damaged.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If the force lock was successful, it would be fine if he suffered some damage.
 However ... If he failed, he would suffer a huge loss.
 "The superpower lock is not strong enough ..."
 "The superpower lock isn't strong ... It doesn't have enough Foundation ... It's too superficial ..."
 Many thoughts flashed through his mind. The next moment, waves of inner strength exploded in his body. Li Hao suddenly had an idea, something that even Yuan Shuo could not do.
 In the next moment, waves of inner strength gushed into his spleen and strengthened the Super Lock. Everyone knew this.
 But ... What about the ninth-refinement force?
 Could it also stack the Super Lock nine times?
 "Even if I can't do it nine times, two times, three times ... The superpower lock is now on par with the mountain. If I use my inner strength to strengthen it and vibrate the superpower lock, will I be able to suppress the mountain instantly?
 The ninth form of the refined force ... Only he and Liu Long knew it.
 This was something that others could not imitate.
 Of course, this process was full of creativity and danger. What if the ninth refinement broke the Super Lock?
 Thump thump thump!
 At this moment, a sound came from his body.
 Liu Long looked at it again and frowned. Ninth refinement force!
  Why was Li Hao circulating the nine tribulations technique at this time?
 "The nine-refinements force ... Stacking the inner strength ... The inner strength is directed towards the spleen to suppress the terrain?"
 Frowning, he carefully looked at Li Hao. Li Hao's spleen was bleeding even more severely. Internal bleeding was often life-threatening.
 Li Hao ... What was he doing?
 The ninth-refinement force was about stacking, vibrating, and overlapping, and instantly erupting with powerful destructive power ... What did he want to strengthen?
 Force?
 That's impossible!
 So ... Strengthen the superpower lock and suppress the terrain?
 At this moment, Liu Long finally understood what was going on. He took a deep breath and thought,"this kid, is he not afraid of the Tiger at all?"
 If he used the ninth-refinement force to layer on the Super Lock, the Super Lock would either break, the impact would be too strong and even his spleen would be crushed, or ... He could only suppress it successfully!

 Of the three possibilities, the chances of success were the smallest.
 Liu Long frowned. At this moment, he was also simulating everything in his mind. Suddenly, he thought of something and hurriedly said, "Don't be anxious, don't do this ... No, it's not that I don't need to use the nine refinements. Split your inner strength into five and strengthen the five organs 'Super Lock! The five internal organs are a cycle, and they are actually a whole. If one internal organ is strong, then the five internal organs are strong, then the five internal organs are strong, then the one internal organ is strong!"
 Most people would be confused by these words.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, instantly understood.
 He seemed to have thought wrong!
 Strengthening the five viscera Super Lock might also strengthen the spleen, but it would be less dangerous. The five viscera were actually a big cycle.
 After all, Liu Long was a veteran Martial Master, and he was more stable.
 It wasn't that Li Hao couldn't be dirty, but it was extremely dangerous.
 Li Hao thought for a moment and decided to listen to the old man. He might not lose out if he listened to the old man, but he might lose out if he didn 't.
 Splitting his internal force into five was also a test of Li Hao's control over his internal force ... In reality, martial masters rarely showed signs of losing control of their internal force. Internal force was born naturally in the body and not from outside. There was no need for much preparation and cultivation to control it. When the strength was sufficient, it could naturally be controlled.
  Five waves of inner strength entered his five internal organs.
 All five of his superpower locks started to be strengthened.
 The next moment, the five chains on his spleen suddenly trembled. Li Hao tried to stack the power of the chains ... With a loud boom, the mountain was pressed down, but in just an instant, Li Hao felt that the impact of the chain was too strong, and his spleen was slightly shattered.
 Not only that, there were even faint cracks on the chains.
 Li Hao was shocked. Fortunately, he had divided his internal strength into five parts. Otherwise, he might have broken the Super Lock.
 BOOM!
 Li Hao weakened some of his power. He didn't dare to stack it too many times. He just stacked it twice. His internal energy surged in and was quickly absorbed by the SuperLock. During this process, the SuperLock shook again.
 The mountain was once again suppressed and locked in a corner!
 One time, two times ...
 Li Hao began to try again and again. He was still generating inner strength in his body. Li Hao became visibly weak, and his face was pale. It was as if all the essence in his body had been absorbed by his five internal organs.
 After an unknown period of time, a loud boom was heard, and the chains clattered noisily.
 After a while, he saw a huge mountain inside his spleen.
 At this moment, it was completely locked by the superpower lock.
 Li Hao opened his eyes, feeling dizzy.
 "How is it?"
 Liu Long hurriedly asked.
 Li Hao panted."I managed to lock it ... I used up too much of my internal energy. My internal organs are damaged ... But ... It's worth it!"
  It was worth it!  When the Super Lock fused with the terrain, Li Hao discovered that the Super Lock that had previously locked the mountain was now growing with the mountain. If one day, his terrain could break out of his spleen ... He would be at the level of spirit accumulation, just like his teacher.
 But at this moment, he couldn't do it.
 The current Li Hao could barely make use of the terrain. The mountain that represented the terrain was unable to fly out of his spleen, which meant that he was not a true spirit cultivator, but a Martial Master who was exploring the path of spirit cultivation in the battle of thousands.
 Even so ... It was already very amazing!
 This was because Li Hao had only just reached the thousand warrior tier.
 "You ... You're heavily injured!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "You can't heal your injuries?" Liu Long frowned.
 "Yes."
 Li Hao nodded and revealed a sickly smile.""It's alright. I may look weak, but when my inner strength recovers, I'll be even stronger!"
 Liu Long nodded, and after a moment, he suddenly said,"The power entered your five internal organs, but you were able to withstand it. My wave power didn't even invade your internal organs, but your internal organs were actually seriously injured. How can your internal organs be weak at one moment and strong at another?"
 “……”
 Silence.
 "Boss, I'm really injured now!" Li Hao coughed.
 Liu Long coldly glanced at him. Little bastard, you have nothing to say now, right?
 Too lazy to argue with him, Liu Long said in a deep voice,"Do you think ... I can try?"
 Li Hao opened his mouth but didn't say anything.
  "You can 't, right?" Liu Long's face turned unsightly.
 Li Hao laughed dryly."It's not impossible ... But ... Boss, let's slowly nurture our strength and five internal organs ... My ... My situation is a bit special. You know that. That's why I've already nurtured them very well before. It's just a try." But don't worry, boss. When I think of a way to get some benefits ... I'll help you ..."
 "Forget it!"
 Liu Long was a little dejected, but he quickly regained his calm,"To be honest, I'm already very satisfied to be able to enter the Qian warrior realm! At least, there's still a way out for now. Fighting against the thousand is just the beginning. My inner strength is still getting stronger, and so are my internal organs ... I haven't reached my limit yet. My real limit is at least that I can deal with those at the peak of the radiant sun realm. I'm not that anxious. "
 The path of a Martial Master was a slow one.
 Li Hao had taken a shortcut. This was also his destiny, or rather, the destiny left behind by the Li family's ancestors.
 If he had an extremely powerful ancestor who had left behind a treasure that could help him cross some barriers, he might have been even more eager and low-key than Li Hao. Li Hao actually did not hide many secrets from them.
 "Do you think that after you recover, you'll be at the same level as your superpower? Can you deal with a late stage three yang like your teacher?"
 “……”
 Li Hao raised his head and looked at Liu Long in silence.

 Late three yang realm?
 You ... You really think highly of me!
 Besides, I'm only at the cultivation stage, not the true accumulation of spirit, so there's still a difference between me and teacher. Teacher's force has already reached the phenomenal success stage, while mine hasn 't, and the Super Lock isn't strong enough.
 His Shi was only at the initial stage, while Yuan Shuo's Shi was completely different!
 He had already succeeded in nurturing his power decades ago!
 How to compete?
 "Boss, I'll tell you after I've successfully cultivated my power!"
 Li Hao smiled bitterly."I've used up too much of my internal strength. I can't use the second stance. I'll try again when I recover!"
 He could only temporarily give up on the sword momentum.
 Just wait!
  Moreover, Li Hao had a feeling that the sword force would be more difficult and dangerous. It was best not to try it now, because he couldn't help but think of the source of the sword force. That sword ... He was afraid that his lungs would be cut open!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The sword was never willing to be bound.
 The source of this energy was the sword he had seen. Li Hao had thought that nurturing swords was similar to controlling the terrain. After thinking about it carefully ... He felt that unless his lungs were strengthened to 1000 cubic meters, it was best not to try to accumulate sword energy.
 "Alright ..."
 He muttered. The sword momentum was on the outside while the terrain was on the inside. It was in line with his intention to defend and attack from the inside.
 He stood up, staggering.
 Li Hao glanced at the city and said,""Boss, let's go. Let's not play with them anymore ... Let's go to the city gate. I look like I'm seriously injured. It won't be embarrassing for five birds sect if I quit training."
 In the city, the greatest benefit was to obtain mysterious energy.
 But now that the sword energy was gone, Li Hao's desire for the mysterious energy was less.
 "Alright!"
 Liu Long didn't say anything. His goal this time was to kill li Dahu, and he had already accomplished it.
 Killing supers to obtain mysterious power. In fact, when one reached the stage of thousand-man combat, one did not expect to advance to a super ... Mysterious power was not as attractive as one thought.
 Therefore, the three sun experts did not have much desire for the mysterious energy.
 Three suns required the breaking of the fifth superpower lock. At this stage, the more mysterious energy one had, the higher the chance of breaking through. It required a long period of grinding, bit by bit, to slowly break the superpower lock. If one were to break it by force, there was a high chance of his body exploding!
 Moreover, at the three yang stage, one could actually absorb some of the mysterious energy born in heaven and earth. The Samsara King had said that Hao lianchuan could produce hundreds of cubes of mysterious energy in two months, which was actually the truth.
 ……
 The city was still in a mess.
 Liu Long and the others disappeared. Although Minister he and the others were a little helpless, they had no choice ... They couldn't keep up and lost them. The other party was a Martial Master, so it wasn't easy to find them. They could only give up.
  Li Hao was injured and didn't want to deal with these supers.  He could see these people, so he directed Liu Long to avoid them one by one.
 In the city ... There were much fewer balls of light.
 Li Hao glanced at Fei Tian and the hidden Third Sun of swords gate. He could vaguely see their existences ... They probably didn't do anything good. At least, Li Hao saw a few light orbs disappearing around them.
 Who were the three suns of swords gate hunting?
 Who were the flying ones hunting?
 Li Hao wasn't too worried about the night patrolmen. The second team had that mid-stage three suns expert. If the other party really dared to go and hunt ... They might be killed instead. Zhang Ting's life was in danger. It would be strange if they didn't make a move.
 On the other hand, the first team had Minister Zhou of the metal element, who was at the peak of the sun glory realm. His combat power was still very strong. He also followed many other sun glory experts and acted together. If any of the three suns dared to make a move ... They might not be able to gain an advantage.
 With this in mind, Li Hao's group passed through the streets and approached the inner city gate.
 Over there, balls of light appeared.
 From afar, someone heard the sound of footsteps.
 In an instant, Hu dingfang came through the air. He didn't dare to fly, but he was extremely fast. When he saw Liu Long carrying Li Hao on his back, Li Hao's face turned pale. His internal force had been used up, and his body was covered in blood.
 "What's going on?"
 Hao lianchuan also rushed over. At first, he thought that Li Hao was pretending ... But soon, his expression changed. It didn't seem like it. Li Hao's body had become thinner. It seemed that he had used up too much of his internal energy. This wasn't an act!
 "Who did this?"
 They were all a little shocked. Liu Long was a warrior of the thousand-man squad, and they had followed the night patrolmen. Who could have injured Li Hao like this?
 They were not the only ones who were concerned. In the distance, Zi Yue and the others also frowned slightly.
 Li Hao ... How did he end up like this?
  On Red moon's side, Purple Moon had greeted them. When she saw Li Hao, she would capture him if she could, and leave him be if she couldn 't.
 If the red moon wasn't targeting Li Hao ... Then could it be the fairy or Yama?
 Li Hao coughed, and some blood flowed out of the corner of his mouth. He glanced at the crowd and panted,""I'm fine ... My internal organs are just a little damaged, and I've used up all my inner strength. I've hurt my Foundation a little ..."
 You call this fine?
 Their expressions did not look good, and Hu dingfang was even more irritated. He said angrily,""Who did this?"
 This ... He wouldn't be seriously injured, right?
 Even if he could be cured, it would be a problem whether Li Hao could continue practicing martial arts under such circumstances.
 He had already abducted one of old demon Yuan's closed-door disciples. If his second closed-door disciple were to be crippled here ... He really wouldn't be able to explain himself.
 Li Hao coughed again and shook his head."I ... I'm not too sure ... I didn't even see him ... He's too strong and too fast ..."
 He gasped for breath."I only saw a dark shadow. It flashed by. I only had time to gather my inner strength to block it. That's it ... The other party is a dark-type expert ..."

 As soon as he said that, many people looked at the three-sun powerhouse who was flying in the sky.
 That person's name was Ding Chen.
 The dark element was mostly from the flying organization.
 Dingchen, who was wearing a cloak, did not speak at this moment.
 "I don't think they're from the fairy ..." Li Hao added."Don't misunderstand!"
 "Why are you so sure?"
 Hu dingfang frowned.
 Li Hao explained,"that person ... Is too strong!" It was just a casual attack, and I almost died. Fortunately, chief Liu was by my side ... Chief Liu ... Has actually become a warrior of the thousand world! An ordinary sunlit wouldn't be able to do this ... So ... That person must be a three yang!"
 "Cough cough ..."
 Li Hao coughed for a while."It was a three-Sun Expert who attacked me!" It seems that this person is the only one with three suns in the fairy realm. If he didn't leave ... It's obviously not the work of a fairy realm expert ... I suspect ... Suspect that someone else has come from outside? Otherwise, with the three suns, there's no reason why no one could find out ... Cough, cough, cough ..."
  As soon as he said that, many people's eyes turned strange.
 Three suns!
 And it was an undiscovered three Sun Expert!
 Li Hao said that he wasn't from the fairy clan, but at this moment, many of them had different thoughts. There was a 99% chance that he was from the fairy clan!
 They were good at concealment. If they wore some extraordinary items, they might be able to hide their three yang.
 Furthermore, Fei Tian was mysterious. All of them wore cloaks and did not dare to show their faces ...
 At this moment, Hu dingfang also looked at dingchen with a cold face and said coldly,""Looks like Fei Tian's preparations are pretty good this time! You guys still have the confidence even though Banshan isn't here!"
 Two three yang!
 Needless to say, it was a flying one.
 The people of the fairy clan were fickle in their emotions. They didn't like Li Hao, so it was normal for them to throw a punch or a palm at him.
 These assassins were often like this.
 "Commander Hu, this matter has not been concluded yet ..." Dingchen said in a deep voice.
 Hu dingfang said coldly,"alright, I'll wait for your Fei Tian people to meet up ... It's one three suns. If we don't pay attention, it's fine. But if we observe carefully, I don't believe there's no clue. If we find a three suns that doesn't belong to your Fei Tian ... Let's join forces and kill them, okay?"
 Since you don't want to admit it, if a three yang appears, just kill him!
 Do you dare?
 At this moment, Ding Chen was also fretful, restless and somewhat resentful.
 Why did he deal with Li Hao for no reason?
 ? If he really wanted to deal with him ... He should just kill him directly!
 In the end, they didn't manage to kill Li Hao, and the other party even came back alive. Damn it.
 At this moment, no matter what he said, it would not be appropriate.
 Once that person returned, everyone was right. If one didn't observe carefully and didn't notice him, it would be very difficult to discover him. However, once the eyes of the three suns were focused on the flying heavens, it would be very difficult for a three sun to hide!
  It would be troublesome then.  He chose to remain silent.
 In fact, it was a silent agreement that there was a second three suns in the fairy realm.
 At this moment, Li Hao still explained,""General Hu ... Don't ... Don't make enemies for the night patrollers! I'm really fine, I'll be fine after recuperating for a while. I don't think I'm from the fairy clan, and I have no grudges with them ... They have no reason to kill me. "
 "You don't understand!"
 "An organization that kills for fun and for its purpose ... You are too young. As the successor of the eight great families, some people want you to live, and naturally some people want you dead!" Hu dingfang said coldly.
 "No... General Hu, you're from the military. I ... I don't think it's a fairy ..." Li Hao said anxiously.
 He was a little anxious. "Don't make enemies for us night patrollers. Even if they do, just treat it as if they're not."
 He didn't die anyway, right?
 As for Hao lianchuan, he also frowned slightly and glanced at dingchen with an ugly expression.""Dingchen, whether it's true or not ... After all, I didn't catch him in the act, so I can't directly say that it was you who did it ... But that person ... Shouldn't you call him over and let everyone get to know him? The city is filled with the younger generation playing around. It's not appropriate for the three suns to enter!"
 Dingchen was speechless.
 He felt a little helpless.
 A moment later, he said in a deep voice,"I believe ... There must be a misunderstanding. The reason why we hid it ... Is only because of the habit of flying. No one likes to expose everything in front of others. Li Hao's attack might have something else going on!"
 After saying that, he let out a sharp and long howl.
 Killing a person was not a big deal.
 However, the point was that the person who had attacked them was the hidden three suns, which was a big deal. Moreover, the target of the attack was Li Hao, which was also a big deal. That was why everyone was so concerned about it.
 Otherwise, who would care if he died after breaking a hundred?
 Accompanied by a long roar, a figure quickly rushed out from the darkness. When he saw that dingchen was fine ... Everyone was looking at him, and the expert under the cloak slightly frowned.
 If you're fine, why did you call me?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Good!"
 At this moment, a fist suddenly smashed down!
  It was Hu dingfang's fist!
 The punch was extremely fast. The other party was also shocked. A Sword of Darkness instantly appeared and stabbed out.
 There was a loud bang!
 The next moment, the cloaked man flew out. At this moment, Ding Chen also quickly stepped forward and said in a deep voice,""Commander Hu!"
 Hu dingfang sent his opponent flying with a punch and said coldly,""So you were the one who attacked Li Hao?"
 The injured cloaked man coughed, feeling baffled.
 Me?
 When did I attack Li Hao?
 I didn't even see Li Hao!
 Ding Chen quickly whispered in his ear for a while. The man's face slightly changed and he felt a little wronged. It was normal for an assassin to kill people, but this thing ... Was really not done by him.
