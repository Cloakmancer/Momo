At this moment, the blood-red ball became even more active.Li Hao didn't stop. He took another deep breath and began to release his aura, swallowing the world like a whale. The surrounding chaotic force rushed toward him crazily!At this moment, the entire square domain started to shake.This was not enough!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly began to weave a great Dao with his bare hands. In the chaos, he began to fabricate great Dao laws and weave them. The human King and the others opened their eyes and looked at Li Hao.Li Hao didn't say anything. He simply poured out all his insights and thoughts in the chaos.He began to draw the divine text with his blood!Divine runes began to form one after another. They were similar to the divine runes from before, but they were also different!"Holy prose?"The human King glanced at it and raised his eyebrows. The first divine rune began to gather. At this moment, it was a divine rune with the word "blood". It seemed to be draining Li Hao's blood, crazily extracting his blood!"What?"The human King was stunned. It wasn't one of the DAOs that Li Hao was good at. Why did this guy draw the divine text of the word "blood"?Li Hao's voice was calm as he said slowly,""Blood is the root of the spirit! No man can not be a human without blood, and no spirit can not be formed without blood! Essence, Qi, spirit, and blood were the foundation of man and spirit! Bloodless people naturally lack spirituality ..."The human King shrugged and didn't care much.I don't care what you condense!'You're really not afraid of killing yourself. Of course, he doesn't really care about this kind of madness. Who hasn't been young?'When I was young, I didn't care about life and death.……At the same time.Within the blood world.It was a vast expanse.Only the chaotic power of the great Dao was extremely dense.Within it, there seemed to be some unconscious spirits floating around.There were the five elements, yin and yang, life and death ... But all of them were extremely scattered.Some spirituality seemed to be gathering, but it also seemed to be dispersing. At this moment, a character appeared in the sky. It was the character 'blood'!The entire turbid world seemed to have some movement.The scattered blood started to gather.It was the blood of countless powerhouses, including Li Hao, long Zhan, those who had died in battle, and those who had been injured. The scattered blood dyed the entire world red.At this moment, the red color began to gather together as if it was being pulled by the 'blood' word.Gradually, the blood gathered together, forming a human figure.Some of the scattered spirits in the surroundings also began to gather in this direction. Gradually, some of the spirits fell into the blood, and the blood-colored figure began to gather in this desolate and silent world. Blood Qi was overflowing!The power of the blood was too strong. It had fused with the blood essence of too many powerful beings. At that moment, it was affected by the divine text of the word 'blood'. It was like the first drop of blood that had been separated from the world. It gathered between the heaven and earth as if it was about to become the spirit of the heaven and earth.The blood Qi was turbulent!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  It was as if the world had been split apart in the legends. At this moment, the chaos within began to gather intelligence.And in the outer realm.Li Hao continued to draw divine runes one after another, integrating his essence, Qi, and blood into this new world.……Li Hao had seen and learned too many DAOs since he rose to power when he was weak.He had inherited many of neo martial's unique skills. He had also received inheritances in Tian Fang. He had walked the Dao of Tian Fang, the Dao of calamity, the Dao of the physical body, and learned the five elements, life and death, Nirvana and recovery ... All kinds of great DAOs.At this moment, he had used what he had learned to outline all of them. He turned them into divine text and imprinted them into the world before him.The chaos didn't seem big.It was very small.Yet, it also seemed to be infinitely vast!Li Hao's spirit and energy merged with it and he sensed some faint changes. A faint smile gradually appeared on his face. At this moment, this world seemed to be ... Giving birth to some living creatures.Chaotic creatures?Was this the first generation of chaotic creatures?He did not know.Maybe it counted, maybe it didn 't. Because ... The spirit and energy inside were actually supplied by the outside.Li Hao didn't really create life.This was because all of this had existed in the first place. It was just that he was now going to reincarnate them.At this moment, Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky.Perhaps ... Only when I truly break through the origin of chaos and seize it will I truly be able to comprehend the creation of life, unlike what I'm doing now. Even if I were to split open the sky, it would only be a fake sky!This sky was still within the range of chaos.Moreover, the source of energy was actually from the chaos.This world was not perfect.Even if he succeeded, he couldn't escape from the original chaos. Li Hao knew that, but this was the best he could do at the moment!At this moment, Li Hao shouted,""Everyone, if you want to enter the New World, you can follow the great Dao and input your own spirituality! Chaos was created, heaven and earth contained spirits, five thousand great DAOs, five thousand gods, demons, demons, and Immortals! A harmonious spirit can not fuse with the body, but a harmonious spirit can turn into an immortal or a devil, a primordial fiendgod!""Grow together with the heavens and earth, comprehend the newborn heavens and earth, forget your memories, and start from zero ..."Everyone was shocked!The expression in Zhi Zun's eyes also changed slightly, and he quickly said,"You mean ... We can enter the New World with harmonious spirit realm and become the first generation chaotic creatures, forget our memories and start a new life?""Right! Of course, if they were killed, they would be eliminated! With your spirituality returning, it's up to you how much you can comprehend. Of course, you'll have to forget your memories and start all over again. Perhaps you'll be devoured before you can even grow up!"

"This world is still sealed off, and the flow of time here is different .... To you, this is an opportunity. To me, this is an opportunity!"Li Hao smiled."I will definitely enter the world again, but ... I'm the owner of this place, so I should be able to preserve my memories and enter. It will be difficult for you, so I'll let you go first! In addition, there are many spiritual existences in this world, such as long Zhan, my master, and red Moon sovereign. Many people's spiritual existences have been integrated into it! Therefore, many chaos godfiends might be born ... And they were all very powerful when they were alive. They might not be weaker than you, or even stronger!""When time returns, I will enter it and completely open up the river and stabilize the world! At that time, the Era of Chaos will end and we will enter the era of creation!"After splitting open the sky, it would have nothing to do with him!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  At this moment, this world was still in the early stage of chaos.This was also an opportunity for everyone.They were too young and had never experienced the era when chaos was created. They had not even experienced Tian Fang.If he experienced it once ... Would there be any gains?There must be!Even though the internal great Dao system was not as complete as the entire chaos, Li Hao had mastered 5000 great DAOs and integrated the power of countless experts 'great DAOs into it. His great Dao system was still quite complete!At this moment, the human King laughed, interesting, interesting! Is it possible for us to regain our memories?""It's very difficult! Of course, you can try, human King!"Li Hao smiled."However, if you leave the world and your spirituality returns, there won't be any problems. But if you leave, you're out!"At this point, he looked at the Queen."Don't rush in, or go in first. Wait for me to enter, and I will wake you up. You have to place all the beings in the divine Kingdom into chaos. These people are the first generation of humans in chaos ..."The Queen quickly nodded.After Li Hao made all these arrangements, the heart world in front of him began to beat violently. With a low shout, countless DAOs trembled madly. Li Hao shouted,""Harmonious spirit realm, enter!"Some of the experts were excited and quickly fused their spirituality into it. It didn't matter if some didn't understand spirituality. The great Dao would naturally extract their spirituality and fuse it into the entire blood-colored world.Gradually, the blood-colored world seemed to have some spiritual light!It became even more resplendent!At that moment, the spring Autumn Emperor suddenly said,""Li Hao, your creation of the world ... Can you allow some demons to enter?"Demon race? Li Hao raised his eyebrows. "I'm a demon race's venerable sovereign after all. I don't know how the New World ... Will be like, but ... If you want to place the human race in it, the chaos race ... Many of them died in battle previously, and some of their spirituality has been integrated into it. It should be able to give birth to the chaos race, but it shouldn't be impossible to give birth to the demon race, right?"Li Hao laughed."The demons don't lack martial arts either. I have neo martial arts, and so do I!" Of course, if you're willing, you can also arrange for some demons to enter ... It's up to you!""But ..."Li Hao paused for a moment and said in a deep voice,"be it humans, the chaos race, or the demons, don't mix too many memories with them. The humans of the divine Kingdom are like white paper now. Even if they know some things, they know very little. They are just ordinary people!""I don't wish for a large number of cultivators to know too much about the current situation and bring everything in the current chaos into the picture. If that happens, there'll be no point in me splitting open the sky! I opened the sky in the hope of ... Creating a new system!" They did not have to follow the existing system and repeat it.The humans that he was going to put in there were only ordinary people in the world. They didn't even have venerable sovereigns. He didn't know what was going on, so it didn't matter even if their memories were preserved.In addition, they had lived in the divine Kingdom for a period of time. In truth, Changing Places did not make them feel much.Perhaps, in their eyes, chaos was still the chaos of the past.For example, what did Li Hao know before he left Silver Moon?He didn't know anything!He did not even know where the Silver Moon was or how the chaos was divided. He did not know anything about the chaos.Spring Autumn nodded and did not say anything else.As the spirits of the powerhouses merged with it, the entire blood-red world seemed to grow in an instant. Spiritual light flashed and shot into the sky!……At this moment, within the blood world.Muddleheaded!Beams of spiritual light descended from the sky!Someone occupied some of the turbid power. Spiritual light flickered, as if they were about to turn into a body of chaos.Some people's spirituality flickered and landed on the stone, as if they had turned into a stone spirit.Chaos was still in a daze.However, at this moment, the first blood with spirit seemed to have some intelligence. It was a little muddleheaded, as if it was born with something, as if it was born with the ability to cultivate ...He captured some Primal Chaos energy and began to cultivate.The power of the great DAOs was extremely chaotic, and the blood-colored figure gradually became clear. It sat there cross-legged, and after an unknown amount of time, a weak will began to spread out."I ... The number one person in the chaos?"The murmurs in this empty world startled the bloody figure. It was as if he had been frightened by himself.It was as if he knew naturally where he was.Chaos!At the beginning of the world, the chaos was created. There were no living things, no living beings. The first generation of living beings in the chaos began to be born!"I am a God from the chaos ... Blood ... Dao of blood ... Dao of blood ... I am the blood ancestor!"

It was like a raving voice. It was a little childish and a little dazed. It was a natural spiritual voice.Although he was a little confused, he knew that he had to cultivate.He wanted to cultivate the Dao!Dao?He seemed a little lost, but he also knew that this was a good time to cultivate. It was as if there were too many chaotic memories mixed in. Sometimes, cultivation methods would naturally appear in his mind.It was very shallow, but it was enough in this place.He was surrounded by the power of Chaos and the power of great DAOs!At the same time.Outside the realm.The spirits of Li Hao and the others merged with it. They took a deep breath, and the complicated expressions in their eyes gradually calmed down. They began to write, and this time, they wrote many words!In fact, it was no longer just a single word, but many, many words.Anger, joy, sorrow, greed ...Desire!He wanted to strip away all his desires, or rather, the uncontrollable desires that were overflowing, and suppress them into the new world. Of course, he was not only suppressing them, but also making this world, the New World, have desires, but ... The desires would not exceed the load.It was fine to have desires, but desires could not exceed one's own limits.He removed all the chaotic energy in his body and suppressed it into a new world.As for himself ... At this moment, he appeared extremely weak.His entire person started to look like an ordinary person.He washed all the blood off his body.Then, he changed into a new set of clothes, and his face became calm again. A Broken Sword appeared in his hand. Li Hao smiled. This is me, Li Hao, alone.I don't want any outsiders.He would abandon everything."That's good too ... I want to start over again!"He turned his head to look at the West and smiled. He hoped that after I entered, the other side would be able to fulfill my wish. Chaos, it's fine if I die early. If I die early, I can merge my spirit into the new world.If he missed this opportunity ... There might not be a next time.At this moment, Li Hao took a deep breath and jumped. Everyone else's spirituality entered the world, but he himself. In an instant, the blood-red world started beating crazily!……At the same time.In the West.The battle was still ongoing.However, at this moment, everyone seemed to sense something, and they all looked towards the east. Chaos panted heavily, but he laughed. In the surroundings, there were fewer and fewer experts.That detestable huntian!At this moment, there were many wounds and bloodstains on his body. They were all caused by huntian. This bastard, detestable!Huntian was also covered in blood.  He looked to the East and frowned.Li Hao, have you opened the sky?It didn't seem to cause too much of a commotion!But at this moment, there seemed to be a fluctuation coming from that side. It was a very special fluctuation that sounded like the beating of a heart. Li Hao ... He opened the sky, but how exactly did he open it?Open up a space?Or to create a world?In fact, everyone was very confused and didn't quite understand, because no one had ever done such a thing.At this moment, the master of tianfang also sighed.""Chaos, give up. You can feel that you don't have much time left. Yes, you've killed many people, but now ... Do you really think you can kill us all? We're all just clones. Even if you really kill us all ... Do you not want to live anymore?"At this moment, there were still seven or eight avatars around, but only seven or eight of the level eights who had come to help were left. Many of the ninefold guards had died, and only a few near huntian were still alive.The chaos had killed too many experts, but he himself had also begun to enter the later stages of his life.He had aged a lot, and his white hair was fluttering."Hehe!" The chaos Emperor sneered."Tian Fang, you hypocrite! Don't give me that!" Since we've fallen out today, even if I give up, do I still have a way to live? Do you really think I'm stupid? I've killed so many people's avatars today, can you tolerate me? Today, either I die or you die! There's no other way!"Although the clone wasn't their true body, they still had to pay a considerable price to send a clone.It's fine if I offend one or two, but if I offend all of them, will they tolerate me?That would be weird!Li Hao ... I've fallen into your trap. This time, I can't get out!At this moment, he also felt a little regretful.However, when he felt the power of time, he no longer regretted it! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At most ... He would just go all out!After killing so many experts, he was like a lamp without oil. However, the people in front of him were not any better!Huntian ...He looked at huntian and sneered. This guy was originally a Big Shot. In the chaos, as long as a tier 9 didn't appear, he would be the Big Brother. He had even been suppressed by him.But now ... He was in an extremely miserable state.The West had been blown up!The dozens of level eight venerable sovereigns under his command were now reduced to a pitiful few. The vast huntian realm and a million years of hard work had all gone to waste today. Huntian probably hated Li Hao even more than he did!How tragic!At least he had obtained time. Huntian, but he didn't get anything.It was too tragic!When he saw that someone was in a worse state than him, he laughed.As for huntian, he seemed to know what he was thinking. He looked at chaos coldly and was a little angry!Today, he was indeed very miserable.At first, everything had gone smoothly. He had suppressed the chaos and annexed the North. Everything had gone smoothly. He had been unparalleled in power and influence. But unfortunately ... His scheme against Li Hao had failed. Li Hao, this shit stirrer, had completely thrown the world into chaos!

At his peak, he had more than 20 level 8 subordinates ... But now?There were still three rank eights alive among the ninefold guards, including those who had quit smoking.As for the eight tier 8 powerhouses who had surrendered ... Only one was left. The point was that this one had been wanting to escape, but he didn't dare to because his old master had been watching him!The other party had originally been a type 9 powerhouse, but now that the two of them were no longer humans, they wanted to run several times, but they could sense the danger and could only brace themselves to hold on.Close to 100 rank 8s were fighting here. At this moment, there were only about 20 of them.Of course, neo martial had run away, but nearly half of them had died!Huntian gritted his teeth. At this point ... If he didn't kill chaos today, he would really suffer a great loss!The others were all clones. At worst ... They could just run away!He couldn 't!He was the true body.If he didn't do anything and chaos really took control of time, he would be the first to be killed, followed by Li Hao and the others. The tier 9 original body would not be his first kill target!"Chaos, Li Hao...I'm waiting for your time to split open the sky for him!"Huntian looked at him coldly."Although I hate Li Hao, I have to admit that this guy has a good eye. If he thinks that you will die and return time ... I believe him!" Perhaps, this was the belief that he was still holding on to at this moment.Li Hao was ruthless. Since he said that he would wait for chaos to split open the sky ... Perhaps chaos would really die. After all, Li Hao was the one who understood the time star the most in the world!"You idiot!" The chaos Emperor laughed."Do you really believe what he says?" If he says you're going to die, will you die?"Scolding was one thing, but it didn't stop him from continuing to be ruthless.Time froze again! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  He attacked instantly. This time, he went straight to withdrawal symptoms beside huntian and sneered,""Lackey, your master is dead and order has collapsed. You're still working for the dark huntian!"Jiejie's eyes were filled with complicated emotions. At this moment, he was also struggling violently!Huntian let out a low roar as the power of darkness exploded, but it was still unable to suppress time. At this moment, they were fighting a war of attrition against chaos, using up his lifespan!In fact, this group of people could not kill chaos by force!With a loud bang, jinkui's body collapsed!The chaos Emperor's face was also deathly pale. Every time he wanted to kill someone, he had to pay a huge price. At this moment, he wielded the power of his great Dao and punched out, breaking down the addiction.However, he himself also staggered slightly, and his will was a little chaotic!Chaos knew...That he had truly reached his limit.He had fixed time and time again, killed powerful enemies time and time again, and killed dozens of experts. However ... His longevity had reached its limit. If he continued to waste his longevity like this, he would probably die of old age after killing a few more!At this moment, outside, Tian Fang transmitted his voice to everyone,""Be careful. This guy has reached his limit. There's a 99% chance that he'll do as Li Hao says and go back to the past with all his resources ..."Although he didn't want to admit it, it was the truth.Li Hao's words were being verified one by one!There was no other way ... Li Hao had once controlled time. He knew that at this point, there was no other way out except to take a gamble!If he won, he would take everything!He had lost ... He was finished.It was as simple as that. If he won, he would be the number one expert in the chaos. He would be unparalleled. If he lost, he would die on the spot.There was no third option.He couldn't escape from the current chaos. There was no place to escape. Even if he escaped, there was no way to recover.The remaining experts were all extremely solemn.Chaos, it was time for the last fight!Huntian, on the other hand, sighed as he watched chaos beat withdrawal to death. Withdrawal had been with him for many years, but today ... It was difficult for him to escape death.However, everything might have been worth it.The chaos had reached its limit!In the void, the chaos Emperor looked toward the east, gritted his teeth, and chuckled.""Li Hao's words are so vicious!"That kid was too black-hearted.'F * ck, you're so good at arranging my path!'"Hmph ..."He laughed. 'Even if I fail and die, you won't have an easy time!'Even if I really die, time will return, right?Alright!I'll ... Add something to your story!He smiled.At this moment, the time star in his hand revolved around him, and a large amount of chaos energy was infused into it. He chuckled. Li Hao, you B * stard, I'm really dead, and time has returned. Didn't you boast shamelessly that you would give it up?If you don't ... You'll absorb time again. Hehe, I'll let you have a taste of Chaos!At this moment, he was already prepared.He was prepared to die in battle!Even if he had to die in battle, he would not give up.Absolutely not!……Within the blood world.It was as if time did not exist. In the originally muddled chaos, some human figures had already appeared.He wandered in the chaos.Boundless!At this moment, a blood-colored figure could be seen, incredibly powerful. He was currently roaming the primordial chaos, and time seemed to be merciless. It was as if time were flowing at a crazy speed, and the blood-colored figure emanated a powerful aura.At this moment, there were already living beings emerging from the chaos.There were original spirits, and there were also spirits that had been integrated into it. They began to recover one after another, like the first generation of gods and demons, wandering in this uninhabited chaos.A battle had also begun in this world.At this moment, the blood-colored figure seemed to have some things echoing in his mind ... He looked at the vast chaos and was a little distracted. This chaos was too lonely and seemed to be missing something.

Perhaps ... There was a lack of living beings?Or was it lacking ... The world?What was the world?He felt a slight headache, but he also seemed to have understood something. Perhaps ... He should open up a world in this chaos to accommodate all the experts?The creation of the heavens and earth?Open a world?The blood ancestor was at a loss. How could he split the heavens and earth?He was bored to death as he wandered through the primordial chaos. He saw many living beings. Some were reviving, some were evolving. He saw an enormous dragon flying in a certain area. He saw a Phoenix flying in a certain area.He saw some strange-looking creatures floating in the chaos.However, none of them seemed to be as powerful as him.p He even saw a rock that had become a powerful living being ...He seemed to have realized something. In the chaos, perhaps I am the most powerful, the first living being.In the South, there seemed to be a ball of fire that was illuminating the world.It was also quite powerful, but ... It was a little special.He had once gone close to take a look. The flame was extremely terrifying and powerful. Perhaps it would soon develop a spirit and become one of the most powerful people in the world.And on this day ...The blood ancestor seemed to have seen something. A ray of light suddenly appeared in the dark sky!At this moment, it was as if the entire chaos was undergoing some changes.An incomparably huge figure appeared out of thin air between heaven and earth.……At this moment, Li Hao had arrived!He laughed as he swept his eyes across the room. At this moment, he had changed his clothes. He looked clean and neat, and there was a sword at his waist. He had the demeanor of a Jianghu person.This was the interior of new world?So many living beings were born so quickly.Although many of them were formed by the convergence of the original spirituality, and the most difficult stage was omitted ... But to think that a cultivator had appeared so quickly ... It seemed that the memory had not been completely wiped out!Otherwise, the cultivation technique would not have appeared so quickly.Looking into the distance and overlooking the world, the internal space was really not small!However, it wasn't too big. In Li Hao's perception, it was perhaps ... The size of the square domain. Such chaos wasn't too big. He pondered. Perhaps ... It needed the power of time to suppress or even expand!It was too small.Was the person in the future born in this world?Looking in another direction, Li Hao sensed a dense vitality force. He raised his eyebrows slightly. Some of the chaotic vitality force ... Belonged to him. It was probably formed by the fusion of a large amount of blood and the convergence of blood, forming a vitality spirit.It was ... Quite powerful!Li Hao was somewhat surprised. How long had it been here?Not long!I'm just a little later than the others, but why does it feel like so many years have passed? the spirit of my blood and Qi seems to have reached the sixth or seventh grade, but ... The great Dao seems to be a little mixed. It wasn't as orderly as he had imagined!He looked in another direction. There seemed to be a ball of fire there, as if it was going to burn the whole world!Eh?Li Hao was stunned and slightly hesitant. That ball of flame was also quite powerful ... Li Hao was a little strange. Its bones were a little ... The aura of the origin of chaos, the spirit of long Zhan?Long Zhan ... Didn't transform into a Dragon?Who was the spirit of the dragon in the other place?He hurriedly turned to look at the other side and was a little confused. After a long while, he clicked his tongue. This ... Was the spirit of the Coiling Dragon sovereign?It should be!The first Dragon between heaven and earth was actually not formed from long Zhan's spirit?Strange!When long Zhan was about to die, he did not want to be a Dragon anymore?To light up the entire world with a fire?Restore the world to its former brightness?Or could it be that the flames had enveloped heaven and earth, engulfing everyone?He wasn't sure what the other party was thinking, and at this moment, the other party shouldn't have any memories either ... All of this didn't have much to do with him.Perhaps, it might not be what he thought. Long Zhan's spirit might not be this ball of fire. In fact, he could not distinguish it too clearly. The key was that when long Zhan died, his great Dao was scattered, his qi and blood were scattered, and his spirituality was scattered. Only the Dragon Soul swallowed some origin of chaos. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  This ball of flame had some Primal Chaos Origin Energy mixed in, so it might not be the key to his spirituality."They're developing quite fast ... To be able to reach this stage in their ignorance ... These people have a bright future ahead of them!"Li Hao nodded slightly, but then he thought of something and looked around.He frowned.Where's my teacher?Even though his teacher wasn't too powerful, he was able to draw on the five elements to gather his spiritual energy before his death. Logically speaking, he shouldn't be too weak. Yet, why didn't he notice the gathering of the five elements?What was going on?Or could it be that the five elements had consumed too much of his energy, and the power of the five elements here was not enough, causing his teacher's spirit to be unable to recover?As he thought about it, he wasn't too worried. This place was sealed and the spirituality wouldn't spread.His teacher would be able to recover sooner or later.It was only a matter of time!At this moment, there was also fighting in the chaos. These primal godfiends seemed to have been born with an aura of slaughter. Perhaps they were affected by the chaotic aura of war, but the entire world was still in chaos.Order had yet to be completely established.Perhaps, he had to wait until he established the river of time and stabilized chaos before order could be established ... Once chaos died, order could naturally be established.He didn't know when chaos died!"I can't wait any longer ... You won't make me wait too long, will you?"If the chaos didn't die, he wouldn't be able to take the next step!Li Hao felt very regretful. If the river was not established, the world would not be stable. Not only that, without the river, that person in the future ... Might not appear, and he would not be able to see Li Hao.

3745 Chapter 605
"In his native world, he can build a long river. Perhaps ... He can meet me.Although this could be considered a new era, for Li Hao ... This was only the beginning, not the end. The key was that he could only wait for the chaos to be killed!"Forget it, it's fine if I wait. I'll also cultivate for a while ..."At this point, Li Hao smiled and looked around. He found it interesting to see the people who had lost their memories and were fighting in the chaos with the spirits that were rising and recovering.Did all of them really think that they were the gods of creation?He looked around and fell into deep thought. Perhaps he should open another door?To give this sealed world some external force to catalyze it?Of course, this would have to wait until the river of time was successfully built and passed through. Otherwise, if it was opened now, the flow of time would be broken, just like how the Stargate had blocked the Silver Moon in the past. However, they had to give the other party a chance to leave.Otherwise, it would be quite sad to be trapped in this place for the rest of his life.At this moment, a loud sound reverberated in the sky from afar!"I am the chaos blood ancestor. Today, I feel that the chaos beings have no one to rely on. I summon the chaos godfiends. In a hundred years, watch me split open the sky!"“……”Li Hao was stunned. You split open the sky?What the hell?'I haven't even perfected this world yet, and you, a spirit born from within, have you sucked too much of my blood and become a little dizzy? what kind of world are you opening?'Li Hao couldn't help but laugh!I haven't even succeeded in opening my heaven and earth, and you're just a half-assed person, opening your damn heaven!Then, his heart moved!Perhaps ... He could take a look.This blood did not belong to him alone. It was formed by the blood of too many powerful cultivators and was born in a new world. Perhaps ... There were some redeeming qualities to it. He could observe it and make preparations for his next opening of the river."This is interesting ... Opening the sky from within the sky? It does feel like I'm splitting open the sky in the chaos ... Could it be ... Splitting open a world?"Li Hao was deep in thought!He could take a look.Speaking of which, when exactly would chaos be killed?I can't wait!……At this very moment.Outside the New World.In the West.The chaos Emperor seemed to know that he didn't have long to live, and he couldn't bear it anymore. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  With a roar, time reversed! The expressions of everyone from Tian Fang changed drastically. This moment had come.At this moment, the chaos Emperor was also cursing,""Li Hao, grandson, I've done what you wanted. I've gone back to the past. Are you satisfied?"Exasperated!However, he was helpless.He was a tier 9, what could he do when he was toyed with?BOOM!His aura seemed to be rapidly growing stronger. However, looking back at the past, it didn't make him younger. It only made his aura stronger, but his longevity was still rapidly decreasing!Chaos grew older, but its aura gradually covered the chaos.Everyone from huntian retreated.This was the chaos 'final struggle!As long as he dodged this time, chaos would die of old age.At this moment, the chaos Emperor's aura surged.

Bastards!"BOOM!As he punched out, all the chaotic great Dao in the chaos seemed to be gathered by him!The chaos great Dao was also fluctuating wildly!Counterattack those ninth-rank true bodies!"Die!"A powerful force covered the area and several powerhouses who were slower were instantly blown up on the spot!"Tian Fang!" Huntian shouted. Paragon sky square didn't say anything. He teleported away and headed east. His goal wasn't to kill chaos, but to avoid his final burst of power.As long as they could hold on for a while, chaos would definitely die.If they kept their clones, they would still have a chance to get rid of Li Hao.Otherwise, with his clones dead and the chaos great Dao in turmoil, he wouldn't be able to descend. That would be troublesome, and Li Hao might have a chance."F * ck!" Huntian cursed in his heart and fled as well!If they didn't run now, they would be killed by the chaos, and that would be a huge loss.The others also fled, but the chaos Emperor had killed several people in an instant. The aura of death began to spread in all directions.Don't even think about it!This was especially so for huntian. He was a living person. If they killed him, they would first extract some of his life force and extend his lifespan.[PS: I can't write anymore.

Chapter 3746 Chaos Gu, Return Of Time
In the outside world, the sky collapsed and the earth sank.In that instant, time in the blood-red world seemed to flow like it was free.Not all of the 5000 great DAOs had spirituality and could become gods.But in the chaos, a large number of first-generation godfiends appeared.A hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.The blood ancestor had split open the sky!This was a major event in the inner chaos. Almost everyone knew about chaos godfiends. In the distance, the monstrous blood Qi had become stronger and stronger over the past hundred years.Respect by blood!Blood was the first divine rune in heaven and earth, and it was also the foundation of all living things and spirits.The blood ancestor's Foundation came from Li Hao, long Zhan, and huntian ...The blood ancestor was created by the blood of a large number of powerful beings.He was born with the Dao and the desire to open the sky. Back then, Li Hao's desire to open the sky was the strongest. Clearly, the blood ancestor's opening of the sky was also due to Li Hao's interference.There was a sense of persistence and persistence in his blood.I want to split the heavens and earth!The chaos had no time.At this moment, he finally understood what it meant to have no time!A hundred years passed by in a flash.In fact, Li Hao did not do anything. He was observing the appearance of the connate godfiends, the perfection of the DAOs, the stability of the pseudo-chaos, and the deficiencies of the DAOs ...In the end, in the blink of an eye, a hundred years had passed!Li Hao was also stunned.So fast!In the past hundred years, the chaos had developed rapidly. A large number of connate godfiends had appeared. Li Hao could actually recognize some of them ... Of course, these people were not intelligent at the moment.They all treated themselves as innate gods ... But they all had their own unique personalities.For example ...Forget it. Li Hao shook his head and looked at the big dog in the distance. He couldn't be bothered to say anything. Heavenly dog swallows the moon. He didn't know if that dog demon was a Black Panther or a new martial arts heavenly dog.They were almost the same.I'll eat whatever I catch!It was probably not the Black Panther. The Black Panther was still fine, as it had also started to cultivate in tribulation. The fellow that ate everywhere was probably the heavenly Hound.Over the years, it had eaten at least a dozen godfiends.He wondered if the powerhouses who had been eaten by it would beat this dog to death when they returned and remembered all this. Of course, they could still beat it in the early stages.The entire chaos was developing rapidly!These innate gods, because no one was fighting with them, and because they were all powerhouses, they naturally had spirituality ... And spirituality was something that only level nine experts could get involved in. Once spirituality was involved ... Coupled with the suitable environment, it could be said that the innate gods who entered this place were all blessed by the heavens. They had truly obtained many benefits.This was the benefit of splitting open the sky.To Li Hao, the changes, development, and progress of the chaos were all in his perception. The changes of the innate gods were also in his eyes and mind.,m In the past 100 years, Li Hao had also cultivated himself, mainly to perfect his internal world.With blood as the river, cells as the boundary, and bones as the Dao ...He was forging himself into a Dao body!A true Dao body!Of course, he didn't absorb too much power of great DAOs. At Li Hao's level, if he absorbed too much power of great DAOs in this place, the unstable chaos might be drained by him.Fortunately, there was still energy pouring in from the outside world. It seemed that there were still people dying.The energy, lifeforce, and the power of great DAOs were still being absorbed by Li Hao's blood world.And this also strengthened the blood ancestor.Li Hao had already sensed that the blood ancestor's strength had probably reached the peak of the seventh rank, and was approaching the eighth rank. It was somewhat unbelievable.Although many of the people who entered were at the eighth step.Level eight was not rare.But ... So fast, in just a short hundred years ... Well, when he entered, it might have been a few hundred years. In a few hundred years, he went from being ignorant to almost level eight ... It was still somewhat unbelievable."It seems like ... My blood still has some intelligence."Li Hao chuckled.At that time, he was beaten up by long Zhan until he kept spitting blood, but he was unwilling to waste it. Almost all of his blood was integrated into the blood world. Later, he was the first to draw the divine text of the word 'blood'. It could be said that this blood ancestor ... Could barely be considered to be made up of Li Hao's blood.Most of them were!As for the remaining, long Zhan occupied quite a bit, and the others also occupied some.They were all top-notch experts!In the chaos era, the energy here was rich. In addition, they were born with the Dao and were naturally connected to the world. It was normal that they were about to reach level eight.However, Li Hao also sensed that the development of this place was slightly different.A specific nomological system had yet to appear, but the blood ancestor's Dao was already somewhat different from his own. In Li Hao's opinion, many great DAOs were divided, but the blood ancestor had fused them all.This was exactly what Li Hao had been doing.Fusing the spirit with the Dao!Now, the blood ancestor was considered a spirit, the first spirit in the chaos. He only had one great Dao of blood, but the power of this great Dao ... Was slightly heterogeneous. However, it was extremely powerful. Li Hao found it unbelievable that a Dao could grow to this extent!The order had yet to be established. Once the order was established, this Dao would become the Dao of the laws of heaven and earth ... And it would become even more powerful! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Order has not been completely established. It seems that chaos is still alive ..."Li Hao mumbled. Of course, it was normal for him to be alive. After all, time had not returned.

Chapter 3747 Chaos Gu, Return Of Time
Li Hao felt helpless!I thought that you would have died earlier. It seems that the time flow between the inside and outside is very different.This blood-colored chaos really did look like the beginning of the world."Forget it, there's no hurry ..."He looked into the distance and saw the auras of the innate gods. It was as if these innate gods would not restrain themselves and were unwilling to do so.There was nothing worth hiding!They were born Invincible and powerful. They were the first godfiends in the chaos. At this moment, a large number of godfiends had gathered there. It was almost time for the date set by the blood ancestor.In fact, the chaos did not have a specific time limit. The so-called 100 years might just be a subconscious concept for the blood ancestor.Li Hao was probably the only one who knew how long it had been.Today, countless gods and devils had gathered there. It seemed like ... The day of the sky splitting was coming.Li Hao thought for a moment and also headed in that direction.Let's see if there are any differences.This spirit had developed on its own. Although it had inherited some of their consciousness, when many consciousnesses were combined together, perhaps ... There would be a different light.Let's see if I can learn from it.……At this moment, there were countless chaos godfiends.They all gathered. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  There were all kinds of creatures in all shapes and sizes, but most of them were humans, or humanoid creatures.The others, such as cats, dogs, Dragons, phoenixes, Tigers ...Both!Each had its own characteristics.Some of them still retained some of their original characteristics, while some simply did not even exist in the original chaos.In the center of the countless gods and devils, there was a man.A blood-colored figure.He was also the first god of chaos, the blood ancestor!His aura was powerful, much stronger than the surrounding gods and demons.At this moment, some of the people around were communicating with their minds. Some of them were curious,""This blood ancestor split open the heavens? what split open the heavens? why does it sound so familiar? what does it mean?""I don't understand ... I just know that he's very powerful!""Yes, he is very powerful!""The number one expert in the chaos!""That might not be the case! The demonic flames in the South formed the Dao. In my opinion, they might not be weaker than this one!""That's true ... I can feel it too. It's very powerful ... And in the North, it's as if a powerful divine being has come into being ...""By the way, have you seen anyone wearing clothes? It looks like clothes ... And there's a small thorn on it ... He said it was a sword!""That one? I've seen it once too ... It didn't feel strong, but when I got close to it, my heart trembled, and I didn't dare to get close. When he looked at me, it was as if the chaos was about to collapse. It was too terrifying. Are you talking about him?""Right!""You've seen it before?""I've also seen it!" “……”At this moment, the group of gods and devils were conversing. Someone mentioned that person. His clothes were as white as snow, and he had a sword at his waist. He was extremely elegant, but also extremely terrifying.Just by getting close, he felt like he was going to collapse.It was as if ... That was the true center of the chaos!Even though the blood ancestor's aura was extremely powerful today, he felt that he might not be as terrifying as that person.However, no one knew the person's name. Chaos godfiends liked to introduce themselves, but that person did not speak. He seemed to always have a smile on his face. From a distance, he only smiled ... As if he was looking at a child.No one dared to get close to him. They only knew that there was an invincible expert in the primordial chaos. Some people called him a swordsman. This was the first time anyone had heard of the sword. However, they didn't know how powerful it was.Are they as powerful as my claws?Are they as powerful as my wings?He didn't really understand!Because they had never seen him before, that person had never made a move, and no one dared to provoke him.Even the blood ancestor had a vague idea of the situation, but he had developed sentience earlier. He had once seen a person fall from the sky. He was very powerful and made his heart palpitate. That person seemed to have come out of thin air, but the blood ancestor didn't know the exact situation.Moreover, he had been busy splitting open the sky these years and had no time to deal with it.However, the blood ancestor wasn't afraid. He was the number one God in the chaos!"Very soon, I'll be splitting open the sky. He actually doesn't know why exactly I'm splitting open the sky, but there's a vague instinct in his mind that he knows that once I split open the sky, I might be able to improve and become a stronger person.How strong?Who knows!In any case, there were only so many innate gods in the chaos realm and he didn't have any concept of levels. All he had to do was to think,'in any case, I'm the strongest in this chaos.'As for the swordsman ... Perhaps, he only looked scary.In fact, with such a small head, he might have been killed with one slap.……Just as the blood ancestor was about to split open the sky ... Li Hao had also arrived.However, he didn't get close and just watched from a distance. He was afraid that if he went over, someone would find trouble with him. There was no other reason. Many of these people were gathered by the dead spirits. If they saw him, they might naturally have hatred.He was afraid of trouble.Furthermore, these innate gods were all born from his own creation. If they came looking for trouble, he wouldn't even be willing to kill one.It would cut off an opportunity to grow stronger.Why!In the distance.The blood ancestor's blood Qi was extremely powerful, and his voice was like a Bell that spread across the chaos."Today, all the gods and demons have gathered. The 100-year time limit has been reached ... I will split the heavens and earth today ... And build the First World in chaos!""The world?""What is the world?""I think I know ... I think it's a place to stay ...""Can't we live in the chaos?"The gods and devils around them were curious. What was a world?

Chapter 3748 Chaos Gu, Return Of Time
Of course, he seemed to have some impression in his mind. He even had some vague memories of some people. The world seemed to be a place where people could live ... There were buildings and civilizations ...What is civilization?Who knows!The blood ancestor was very cold. What did these godfiends know?The world was heaven and earth.The creation of the heavens and earth!Self-control!I'm invincible in this world. No matter how strong you are, you can't be compared to me.This was the world!Do you understand?Of course, he didn't go into detail. At this moment, he looked towards the primal Chaos void with some excitement,"today, I will open the sky of the blood world!"As soon as he finished speaking, his qi and blood surged!Heaven and earth split into two!Originally, the chaos had no sky, no earth, no top, no bottom.However, at this moment, as his qi and blood appeared, it was as if they wanted to completely separate the chaotic heaven and earth. The turbid air floated down while the clear air rose.The surrounding gods and devils suddenly lost control of their qi and blood, and qi and blood energy surged.Someone exclaimed!As for the blood ancestor, something that looked like divine text suddenly appeared in front of him ... Li Hao looked at it and laughed. It seemed that the divine text had been integrated into the great Dao.This person has mastered the power of blood and has also made my divine stationary appear.This was rather interesting.He was deep in thought. How should this person open the sky?What kind of sky could he open?"Kill!" The blood ancestor let out a fierce roar, and tens of thousands of streams of blood Qi gushed out, instantly materializing the divine text. The massive divine text covered the entire area, and countless streams of blood Qi gathered from all directions.A great Dao appeared out of thin air and transformed into a realm.In the chaos, a blood-red continent appeared!Originally, there had been no land in the chaos. However, at that moment, a blood-red continent appeared and began to spread wildly. A divine rune covered the entire continent.The great Dao stood!Vaguely, it stood on the continent, and not only that, blood Qi was gathering in the surroundings, as if ... It was about to form a cocoon! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Yes, a cocoon.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered thoughtfully. This was actually a way to use a Dao domain. However, the blood ancestor in front of him probably didn't know about Dao domains. He might only have some vague memories."Splitting open the sky ... It's just a small realm ..."  Li Hao muttered.At this moment, the blood-red Avenue suddenly soared into the sky. Li Hao's eyes moved again.At this moment, the entire chaos seemed to tremble. Some of the divine runes of the great Dao that Li Hao had hidden in the surrounding chaos barrier suddenly emerged and connected with the blood-colored great Dao.Li Hao's eyes twinkled.You didn't learn anything else, but you learned to steal!Yes, this guy had actually connected his blood-colored great Dao to the barrier of the blood-colored chaos. Clearly, it had the same nature as Li Hao's fight for the origin of the chaos great Dao.This guy ... Actually used such a method to stabilize his great Dao.It could also extract the entire power of chaos. This chaos was a fake source of chaos, which was also the source of life. Instead of creating the source of life himself, the blood ancestor penetrated the barrier with his great Dao and seized the power of the source of life created by Li Hao.You're not a thing!Li Hao chuckled. Of course, he didn't stop them. The river of time hadn't been established yet, so it didn't have a strong enough vessel to carry these great DAOs. The blood ancestor's great Dao had nothing to rely on, so it could only rely on chaos.That was normal!However ... The heavens and earth were created in a rather perfunctory manner. There was no source of life, no power of time or space. It was just ... A ball that was forcefully created. F * cking hell, was this your heaven and earth?Li Hao was speechless!Cut out a small piece from the chaos, then connect the great Dao to the world, absorb the power of the fake origin of chaos that you created, and then ... It will become your world?I'm really ... Convinced by you, sixth brother!Li Hao chuckled and observed carefully. Gradually, he had some ideas. It was not bad. By dividing the sky and earth like this, the power of blood would be completely concentrated, and the great Dao ... Would be more distinct.At the very least, the blood power in this world was completely under the blood patriarch's control.He looked around at the chaos around him, deep in thought. In that case, if the myriad DAOs and myriad worlds created countless worlds like this ... And then carried them separately, he should be able to temporarily distinguish the great DAOs.With the river of time as the vessel, it connected the inside and outside of the pseudo-chaos, providing enough energy to establish order, dividing the heavens and earth, and the myriad realms ... This way, each realm had its own Dao, and the great Dao was distinct. In the river, thousands of DAOs gathered ...The strong would enter the river and comprehend the myriad DAOs, while the weak would comprehend the unique great Dao ...He was more and more clear on what he should do next.Although the blood ancestor wasn't too innovative, Li Hao could still use him as a reference.It was still alright!At this moment, the blood ancestor was ecstatic. A huge blood-colored ball appeared in front of him and was expanding rapidly. In the chaos, blood-colored force surged wildly!Even the gods and devils were retreating. He was overjoyed and laughed."This is the blood world! The First World of Primal Chaos, the creation of the world ..."There was quite a lot of self-praise.Li Hao felt that this personality had nothing to do with him. He didn't like to boast. This guy might have been infected with someone else's blood and developed such a bad habit.It was possible.There had been a lot of bloodshed in the previous battle between the human Kings. Perhaps it had also mixed in, causing the blood ancestor to have the savage nature of a human King.

Chapter 3749 Chaos Gu, Return Of Time
Speaking of which, why didn't the human King do anything when he was so arrogant?Even if one's spirituality had become a God, logically speaking, one should at least be a little arrogant, right?As he was thinking, he suddenly heard the gods and devils around him laugh."Is this the so-called splitting open the sky? I thought there would be some earth-shattering commotion! Is your relationship just like that?"Li Hao instantly looked at the godfiend and saw an extremely powerful figure appear in the sky.But ... Seventh-grade?Li Hao took a look. Probably.In this New Primal Chaos, he could only make a simple judgment. That person ... Was the human King, right?He couldn't be sure. These people's spirituality was ever-changing. Unless their nature was obvious, it was hard to be sure.The man sneered,"blood ancestor, you dare to call yourself number one in the chaos?" I'll be the first to disagree!""Who are you?"The blood ancestor was furious!"I am ..."That person seemed to hesitate for a moment, as if he had no name. At this moment, he suddenly laughed,""I am the king of Creation. Who Do You Think You Are when you see the blade of creation? how dare you claim to be number one?""Gods, Devils, demons, and Immortals, would you rather have the guts?!" The human race will rise ..."After roaring, he was a little confused. What was the human race?Who cares!He continued to roar."The chaos is number one. I'm not convinced. Watch me Cut You Down!"“……” Li Hao's head hurt. Damn, human King, 100%!What a mess!Even if you have lost your memory, are you still going to cause trouble everywhere?My chaos has just given birth to a God, so don't mess around. If you cause a Great War between the gods and the demons, with countless casualties, I won't be polite to you!While Li Hao was still thinking, a great battle broke out.That person charged into the sky and charged at the blood ancestor!"Let's go together! What are you afraid of? kill him! We'll be number one!"“……”Some of the gods and devils in the area actually began to stir. They all felt that this person ... Was very familiar, and somewhat ... Familiar. A moment later, many of them charged toward the blood ancestor!Li Hao was completely helpless!Needless to say, 90% of the people who rushed out were from neo martial arts.I'm really convinced by you guys.Did he have to cause trouble everywhere he went?I didn't even get angry when the blood ancestor opened the sky, but what's wrong with you when he said you were first?And you're not happy about it! They actually ... Really started fighting!Li Hao shook his head helplessly. He glanced at the human King, who was charging at him, and then at the Furious master. Fine, let's fight. It would be best for the human King to leave as soon as possible. If he didn't ... Li Hao was worried that this guy would completely throw chaos into chaos!It was already chaotic enough.Before order was established, if he stirred things up ... It would be a hundred percent more chaotic!"You're the one looking for trouble ... If you're killed, you're out!"Li Hao muttered. I'm not messing with you.With you around, if you don't leave, I'm really worried ... The future might be changed by you, and that's not a good thing.The human King was already very powerful. Even if he were to rise to power in this world, he might not be much stronger.On the contrary, it would cut off the opportunity for the later generations.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 So ... After some careful thought, Li Hao realized that it might not be a bad thing for these innate gods to die. They might have gained some insight and died."That's right ... That should be the case. Innate gods, even if they don't die today, when I create the new order, they will ... Die!"Li Hao muttered, not bad!Otherwise, these people would interfere with the future. There was no need to let them participate in the future. Otherwise, they would affect the development of the entire world.At this moment, he had made some decisions."When I open the sky ... I should use my desire to seduce the gods and demons in the heavens, then ... Kill them all, turn my body into a world, and return my spirituality!"In front.A great battle broke out.The blood ancestor was indeed powerful. Although the man who seemed to be a human King wasn't weak either, he was extremely powerful and crazy. He had also brought a group of people with him, but the blood ancestor had quickly killed several people. The world seemed to shake.There seemed to be a flash of spiritual light, and it was as if it was Raining Blood.A level Seven human King against a level eight blood ancestor, who had just opened the world and had divine runes connected to chaos ... Although the battle was fierce and the human King was indeed strong, he soon began to lose."Your saber Dao is not bad!"At this moment, Li Hao saw that even though the human King had lost his memory, he had to admit that the violent blade technique was used well. He nodded slightly. The human King was dead, but the blade Dao could be passed on.If he could get rid of the interference of other great DAOs, he might be able to produce powerful sword cultivators in the future!The human King himself was one with thousands of DAOs. However, everything was still presented in saber techniques. If saber techniques were passed down, it would be enough to make people stronger in this world.If the great Dao was purer and the rules were clearer, the experts who walked out would not be too weak.Seeing the human King go crazy and even start to slash everywhere ...Seeing that this unstable chaos was about to collapse, Li Hao was helpless. Some of his qi and blood surged out and were instantly extracted by the blood ancestor. The blood ancestor was stunned, and he seemed to become much stronger all of a sudden.He didn't have time to think much. Just as he was having a headache, he saw that he had become stronger and was suddenly overjoyed!A divine text with the word "blood" fell from the sky!The blood-colored world instantly enveloped the human King as he roared,""A mere minor Dao dares to fight? you're looking for death!"BOOM!Within the world, the blood of the human Kings who were wrapped up was instantly extracted. Their blood exploded, and their powerful God-devil bodies began to explode in the blink of an eye.
