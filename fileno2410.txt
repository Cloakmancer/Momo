"I'm here, it can't escape!"Red Moon Emperor said indifferently. Why don't we break the seal and let my true body catch it? once we catch it, we'll split it into three parts. How about it?""Zheng Yu, li daoheng, we don't have to fight to the end. Aren't you trying to vindicate your Dao and become emperors?" He looked at the two of them and smiled.""After annexing the Silvermoon world, there's a chance of becoming an Emperor! The Silvermoon world was given to Zheng Yu! If two Dao universes are combined, one can also become a monarch. Li daoheng, since you plan to do this ... Why don't you take this Dao universe? As for me ... I only need this time star ... Even half of it will do. In addition, the three of us will have some gains from the origin tracing neo martial yin-yang world!""Otherwise, if this goes on, the three of us might end up empty-handed. Although Li Hao isn't too strong yet, he's improving at an unimaginable speed ... Once he steals a star and fuses with the two universes, we might all be killed by him!"Three parts of the world!Zheng Yu laughed."I have no objections. Li daoheng, what do you think?"The sword-carrying man looked at Zheng Yu indifferently.""Zheng Yu, why are you being so pretentious? After all these years, others might not understand you, but I do! If it wasn't for you, I might have succeeded a few years ago! Don't think I don't know that you've been dragging me down!"Zheng Yu laughed."I didn't even know of your existence ... I only found out about it after Li Hao told me. You want me to be the scapegoat?"The man with the sword on his back laughed contemptuously,'the young master of the Zheng family is a burden ... I've seen it long ago! This Xun Song was not spread by this Lord. Don't you know who spread it?"Zheng Yu laughed and said,'what does it have to do with me? All these years, I can't even take a single step out of Hurricane city ...""If you want to act, then continue acting!"The sword-bearing man ignored him and continued to look forward.There was a big piece of meat in front.Everyone wanted to eat it, and they were all very envious. They could see it, but they couldn't touch it. This kind of feeling made it impossible for you to give up, but you had no choice but to give up ... The three of them were like donkeys, being led by this carrot hanging in front of them.Three half-step sovereigns had been played by a star!"The only way to lure it here is to make some big moves ... I've tried several times before, but I couldn't lure it here. This shouldn't be the first time Li Hao has lured it here ... According to my judgment, if we want it to approach again, we have to combine the two Dao universes ... Or ..."After a pause, the man with the sword on his back said,""How about I kill you all and devour you all to become a venerable sovereign!"Zheng Yu stepped back and smiled."Don't try to get your hands on me. I'll join forces with the venerable sovereigns. You can 't!" Why don't you think of another way? even Li Hao was lured out a few times, so why can't you? Why don't we ... Think of a way to devour yueshen and the Heaven's Will? perhaps the unity of heaven and earth will be able to lure it out. What do you think?"He looked at the man with the sword and said,"you'll have to pay a price. Li daoheng, you've schemed to this day ... And now you have countless clones. Why don't you try to merge them into one and then get rid of yueshen? perhaps ... You'll have a good chance of seizing this star?"  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The sword-carrying man didn't say anything. He was silent for a moment before he suddenly said,""Li Hao is a huge threat! You and I should all understand that Li Hao will become a huge threat sooner or later. Even though we were prepared, Li Hao's connection to the past and future has already disrupted some of our plans ... We need to get rid of him!" "It's not easy to solve!""No!" Zheng Yu shook his head."Heaven and earth are being suppressed again. It's going to be difficult for us to get out!"The man with the sword looked at the two of them."I have an idea. Let's not wait for Li Hao to resuscitate the world. It'll be difficult to determine the winner between the three of us here!" Why don't we get rid of Li Hao first ...""How do we solve it?" Zheng Yu smiled faintly."If Li Hao can descend into the real Dao universe, I naturally have a way to descend into the void Dao universe and envelop the world for a moment!"The sword-carrying man said softly,"it's just that the time will be very short ... During this period, the three of us will join forces and attack the truth Dao universe!" Let's try to combine the two DAOs into one for a short time and lure this star here ... At that time, the three of us will decide the winner!"As soon as he said that, Zheng Yu and red Moon sovereign's eyes flickered slightly.The two of them looked at li daoheng and fell into deep thought.Since this person dared to make such a suggestion ... Did it mean that he was 100% confident?"The guy in the North is the celestial pole clone, right?"Red Moon Emperor suddenly said,"he is holding the saber of blood Emperor and has the power of a half-step Emperor. He is also a big threat. If the three of us do as you say and attack the truth path universe together, what if that guy joins the battle?"That person was not weak.To be honest, this clone of his might not be able to match the other party. If the other party was from the celestial pole, he would be an old venerable sovereign. He also had the saber of the blood Emperor in his hand ... He was not to be trifled with.Zheng Yu chuckled,'do you still not understand li daoheng's meaning, venerable sovereign? It's not convenient for me and him to make a move ... Why don't you put in some effort to deal with that person?"Red Moon sovereign sneered.That's wishful thinking!I'll deal with that person, and you guys attack Li Hao. Li daoheng hopes to combine his two DAOs into one, while Zheng Yu is also eyeing the time star. At the critical moment, li daoheng might give up on the time star, and Zheng Yu would no longer have any ideas about the two Dao universes.In the end, he was the only one who gained nothing!The man with the sword suddenly said,"as long as we can defeat that one and break the blood saber, the seal of the eight cities will collapse on its own!" Red Moon sovereign, this is your chance. If you are willing to bet, then try it! If you're not willing, then forget it!"

Red Moon sovereign's heart skipped a beat as he looked at the two of them.Zheng Yu chuckled and said,"when the venerable sovereign wants to break the seal, li daoheng and I will naturally stop him!" But this time, if he and I are drawn by the great Dao universe, then ... The venerable sovereign's opponent won't be three half-step sovereigns, but only one ... I have to say, fellow Daoist li is very creative ... Each taking what he needs!"Originally, it was impossible for Red Moon Emperor to agree. How could he agree to deal with the celestial pole clone?But now, he was suddenly tempted.The universe of the great path, Time and Stars were indeed good things. These two would definitely seize them. However, it was not like he would not gain anything from dealing with the celestial pole clone. If he could really defeat the other party, break the blood saber, and break the eight cities array ... He would be able to walk out!Let's see who's faster!If he had defeated Heaven's Fate in advance, his true body would've come out. Before these two half-step sovereigns could succeed, he would've killed them and taken everything!Of course, if he couldn't defeat li daoheng in advance and Li daoheng completed the unification of his two DAOs in advance and proved his venerable sovereign Dao ... It would be troublesome.As for Zheng Yu ... Since he dared to say so, he must have some confidence in seizing the dual-Dao universe or time star ...The three of them had their own thoughts, each with their own ulterior motives.In the distance, the star seemed to be disappointed and bored when it saw that the three of them had stopped chasing. It rolled a few times on the spot and suddenly disappeared.This time, the three of them didn't chase after him!"Li daoheng, have you locked onto the location of the truth Dao universe?" Zheng Yu asked. And ... What makes you so confident that you can quickly defeat Li Hao, seize the Galaxy, and complete the fusion?""This fusion ... Does it require something else?"He looked at li daoheng, but the latter ignored him.Zheng Yu chuckled."This is probably something you've been planning for a long time. You've never mentioned it before, but you suddenly brought it up today. Could it be that ... You're confident that you'll succeed?"At this moment, Zheng Yu was not as stupid and incompetent as everyone had imagined.He also seemed to be planning something.It was as if he was very confident.Even though he knew that li daoheng seemed to be plotting something, he was fearless and smiled brightly.""Forget it. It's fine if you don't say it. If it really can be done ... I don't have any objections, and neither do the venerable sovereigns. I think it can be done!"Among the three of them, he seemed to be the weakest and had the least trump cards.At least, li daoheng controlled the void Dao universe, and the red moon venerable sovereign was a venerable sovereign. He was the only one who did not control a universe and did not have the power of a venerable sovereign, but he was the first one to agree.The man with the sword looked at him with a deep gaze. After a long time, he nodded. "That's good! As long as venerable sovereign is okay with it, give me some time to help yueshen recover ... I don't have the power of the people, and it will take some effort to descend to the Silver Moon ... I will definitely be able to descend to the void Dao universe in half a month or one month. At that time, the three of us will have a chance!"He could either become a venerable sovereign or break the seal with his true body.However, Red Moon sovereign suddenly said,"I can't do it now!" That guy has the blade of the blood Emperor and his clone has been cultivating for 100000 years. I might not be able to deal with him ... If you want me to agree, I need some other things!"He didn't try to be brave.Instead, he looked at the two of them and said,"Zheng Yu, you've taken a lot of my Crimson moon's power over the years. Return it to me!" I know that you have not been invaded by the Crimson Moon! "Also, it's the same for li daoheng. Over the years, you've taken a lot of my Red Moon Power. The moon god's original body is filled with a large amount of Red Moon Power ... You need to return it to me to help my clone improve! Otherwise, if I go and deal with that guy, I will lose without a doubt!""Sure!" "I have no objections!"The two of them agreed readily. Red Moon sovereign's eyes flickered for a moment. He smiled and did not say anything more.Zheng Yu suddenly laughed again,"if word gets out, it'll be a joke!" A venerable sovereign and two half-step sovereigns hiding in the dark, scheming against a Heavenly King ... A young man in his 20s, and it's a three-way agreement. Is it Li Hao's honor, or are we too incompetent?"The few of them did not speak again.These words touched them.That's right!Whether they had other plans or not, the three experts were indeed scheming against Li Hao, and they had even joined forces to deal with him. They had even given up some of their grudges.It was unbelievable!His opponent was only a Heavenly King.Red Moon sovereign spoke again,""Some people are geniuses, and in every era, there are heroes. Your rise as the neo martial artist King is not that big! "Since the few of us can't become such people ... It's only natural for us to join forces and kill such an existence in advance. After all, we're not as good as them ..."A venerable sovereign said that they were not as good as them.The two of them didn't seem to agree, but they quickly calmed down and didn't say anything. Maybe!If even venerable sovereigns said so, then even the weakest venerable sovereigns were still venerable sovereigns ... If such an evaluation were to spread, even the chaosverse and the myriad world Lords would think that it was an extremely high evaluation!The sword-carrying man didn't say anything and left,""Don't cause trouble here in the near future ... Otherwise, our previous plan will be completely over! I hope the two of you can be quiet for a few days!"With that, he stopped chasing after the stars and instantly disappeared.Zheng Yu looked at his back and suddenly laughed as if he was talking to himself,""This fellow must have done something and is very confident. Otherwise, he wouldn't have taken such a risk!"Red Moon sovereign smiled and said,""Aren't you the same? Zheng Yu, this person is difficult to deal with. If there's a chance ... We can cooperate!""That's right!" Zheng Yu smiled and nodded."I hope there will be such an opportunity!"After he said that, he looked around and smiled,"this universe is really big!" The universe of the great path is indeed magical. I'll look around. Venerable sovereigns, do as you please! By the way, if the venerable sovereign breaks out of the seal and counterattacks new martial arts ... Remember to give me a hand!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  Red Moon sovereign looked at the two leaving figures and raised his eyebrows slightly. These two guys ... Were indeed not to be trifled with.If he cultivated seriously, he might even have a chance to become a venerable sovereign after passing the neo martial venerable sovereign's tribulation.However, the two of them had chosen to plan in the small world.They were quite ambitious. A simple venerable sovereign might not be enough to satisfy them!p He also laughed and disappeared in an instant, but ... A half-step sovereign was still a half-step sovereign. After all, he wasn't a venerable sovereign, was he?[Well, it's almost the new year, but I haven't bought new clothes for the new year. I haven't bought any for my wife or children. I don't know if anyone understands what I mean. Is it too late to buy them tomorrow?] [Test him)]

2412 Chapter 403
The universe of the great path.The long river surged and pierced through the void.The 180 great stars illuminated the world.However, at this moment, the light of these 180 stars gradually dissipated and disappeared into the Galaxy. In their place were new stars filled with sword intent.The great star was replaced!The "Dao" word that had suppressed the Galaxy gradually disappeared and was replaced by the "sword" word that was rotating in a myriad of ways.Li Hao was handing over the control of the Dao universe to Hong Yitang.Just as outsiders had guessed ... Hong Yitang was most suitable to take over the Dao universe. Without Li Hao, it seemed that it would not be too difficult for him to take over the Dao universe.However, unlike Li Hao, who had lit up 180 stars, Hong Yitang had barely reached the second level of Dao integration and only lit up slightly more than 70 stars, which was much less than Li Hao.Of course, it was not a big problem.However, if one's realm was not high enough, it was easy for the upper limit of one's great Dao to be lowered. It was difficult for ordinary martial masters to sense it, but Dao integration cultivators and heaven and earth could experience some changes or even counter-pressure.Li Hao, who was at the fifth level of the Dao integration realm, was already comparable to a peak Heavenly King, but Hong Yitang was still far from him.At this moment, Hong Yitang had replaced Li Hao and controlled more than 70 regions. He didn't control the other regions. As a result, Li Hao's withdrawal of his star might cause the great Dao to collapse.Hong Yitang frowned slightly. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Li Hao was about to speak when Hong Yitang sighed.""My strength is not as good as yours, my realm is not as good as yours, my body is not as good as yours, and my endurance is not as good as yours! It'll be difficult to reach the fifth level of the Dao integration stage in an instant ..."Li Hao was about to open his mouth when Hong Yitang interrupted,""If I learn from you ... No, I won't learn from you. I'll completely merge with the great Dao and become the master of the great Dao River. Can I raise my limit?"Li Hao was slightly shocked.Hong Yitang was calm,'I can't just take everything from you and ask you to give me everything, right? I know that you might have a way, but the price you have to pay will be very high. You're only at the fifth level of the Dao integration realm. It's too difficult for you to forcefully raise my level!""Why don't I just merge into the river?"Li Hao was stunned for a moment, but he didn't say anything."You haven't told me if there's any hope?" Hong Yitang laughed.The so-called complete integration with the river meant that he was completely bound to the great Dao, bound to death!Essence, Qi, and spirit were all integrated into it!This was different from Li Hao 'S. Li Hao didn't completely merge with it. He just sank his body into it and took a nap. Hong Yitang, on the other hand, meant that if he completely merged with it, Changhe would be him, and he would be Changhe!If the river is destroyed, I will die. As long as the river doesn't die, I won't die. A human body turned into a Taoist body.Li Hao thought for a while and didn't object. He simply said,""Uncle-master, if you completely integrate with it, you will definitely be able to improve further! But there's also a huge drawback. The biggest drawback is that ... You won't be able to escape!"Hong Yitang's smile was a little different.""How many venerable sovereigns can't even think of such an opportunity? Even if new martial arts and human King became the masters of the world, they were also integrated into the world and the great Dao in a different way ... How many venerable sovereigns yearned for this opportunity? It's an opportunity for many venerable sovereigns to be completely integrated into it. What disadvantage are you talking about?""Do you think I'm like you?"Hong Yitang's smile was strange."Who can be like you? a new universe of the great path. You gave it up just like that!"Li Hao, do you really think this is a sacrifice?It wasn 't!Being completely integrated into the river was an opportunity, just like how Emperor Cang merged with the neo martial world and the human King merged with the neo martial world. Why did Li Hao say that an opportunity that many people yearned for became a disadvantage?Li Hao touched his head and smiled."No... It's just ... I don't have much freedom, right?"He thought for a while and said,"I'm worried. I'm worried that the universe will be the same as the universe of origin. Once the universe can't be covered by the bed, uncle-master won't be able to go there!" Just like the current Silver Moon, the human king and emperor Cang can't come to the places where the origin can't cover. I think we have to think of other ways!""The universe is so big and endless. How far do we have to go?"Hong Yitang looked at Li Hao."You haven't even left Silver Moon. How far do you think you can go?""I don't know,"Li Hao laughed."I just feel that ... To be integrated into it ... Forget it. Actually, it's fine. It's just ... I feel a little lost. Even if I can cover the chaos, I still feel uncomfortable. However, if martial uncle really wants to make this choice, then that's fine!"He might have been thinking too much.The universe of the great path might also be able to expand endlessly, so why should he care?It's just that ... Since martial uncle has chosen this path, I won't choose it.The creation of heaven and earth and the creation of the great Dao were all for the sake of power, longevity, and freedom. If one was completely bound to the great Dao in the end, it would be meaningless. When I was young, I liked this Dao. When I was old, if I liked the origin, I could go to the great Dao of origin to play ... If the two DAOs were not compatible, wouldn't I be unable to go?What a pity!If the two Dao universes are incompatible or repel each other, it would be a pity. I have never seen those neo martial experts.However, Hong Yitang's choice to completely integrate ... Was not bad!Li Hao had already laid the foundation for the river of chaos.At this moment, as long as he extracted his physical body and allowed Hong Yitang to fuse with it completely, he would save himself the trouble of advancing to the fourth level of the Dao integration realm, let alone the fifth level.

2413 Chapter 403
With a little more strength, the power of a long river was enough for Hong Yitang to step into the fifth rank.But ...Li Hao actually wanted to say a few words, but this would only make him even more bound to Silver Moon!Ten thousand stars and ten thousand DAOs!This River was formed by the power of the people. If the people were killed, the river might be extinguished. If someone were to be ruthless and kill the ten billion cultivators of Silvermoon, Hong Yitang might be dead.There were countless thoughts in his mind. He believed that Hong Yitang knew it too.However, he still chose to do so.Did Li Hao have a way to make him improve without completely merging with the river?There were still some, such as injecting his own great star power into the opponent's great star, but Li Hao would have to pay a great price.Obviously, Hong Yitang knew what he was doing.At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything else. He looked at Changhe and said,""Then I'll have to congratulate you in advance, uncle-master, for truly becoming the Dao Lord of this universe! In the past, I liked to call this place the bright star field, but in the future ... I'll follow martial uncle's name. Why don't we call it the sword field?"This sword was Hong Yitang, Li Hao, and the sword venerable!This universe actually originated from venerable the sword and Li Hao. Today, Hong Yitang was actually the master of the third generation.Venerable the sword might not have seen this universe before, nor did he know that this universe would be born. But Li Hao was very clear that this universe of great ways originated from venerable the sword!"Sword World?"Hong Yitang mumbled. After a long time, he laughed. "It's not nice!""Why don't we call it the sword pool?" he shook his head.Li Hao was stunned for a moment. Was this nice?It didn't sound good at all!The sword pool ... Those who didn't know better would think that it was a small pond.Hong Yitang, on the other hand, was all smiles. This was the sword pool!Yes, a pond.Some people thought that this was the vast ocean, the center of the universe, the only place in the world ... But it was not.He wanted to let people know that this was only the sword pool.Someone had once given up on the universe of the great path that was within his reach. In his eyes, this was a pond, a pond that limited him, even if he had not succeeded and had not left the small silver Moon world.However, Hong Yitang believed that this day would come.There would be a day when the universe of the great path would just be a pond in his eyes.Sword World?No, it could only be called the sword pool!Outside the sword pool, he believed that the young man beside him could go even further. He could walk out of this pool, jump out, and truly transcend. One day, he could open the world with a single thought, and rise to the great Dao with a single thought.The sword World was too big!I'm just a copycat, how can I be called the sword World?The moment this thought appeared, it disappeared. Hong Yitang seemed to be very satisfied."The sword pool is a place to wash swords! A place to cleanse the lead! In life, Lu man would always stop and rest her feet. The place in front of me is just enough for me to stay for a while. " Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Li Hao fell into deep thought and didn't speak again. So be it, sword pool!"Then, martial uncle, let's start!"Hong Yitang suddenly smiled bitterly."I want to merge with the river. Although it's a good thing, I might not be human anymore. Why are you in such a hurry to send me on my way?"“……”Li Hao was speechless!You asked for it."Then ... Martial uncle, forget it ..."p "Aren't you ruining my future?"“……”"What exactly does uncle-master want?" Li Hao smiled bitterly.Hong Yitang also laughed. His laugh was meaningful."Li Hao, I don't have many regrets in my life. Now, I may not be human anymore, and I'll take care of Hongxiu myself, but I still have a daughter ... You can take one or two ... You can release one or a group of sheep ..."“……”Li Hao looked at him in a daze.Hong Yitang sighed,"in this life, people come and go, fighting and fighting. In the end, it's still for the sake of their descendants! I don't care if it's too long ago, but I only have one daughter ... Li Hao, this can be considered my last regret as a human!"Li Hao was stupefied."Uncle-master, you're cultivating. You're not committing suicide. You're not seeking death. This is giving you a Dao universe!" If you become the master of the great Dao, then Hong Qing will be the daughter of the great Dao, and his status will be extremely noble. Why would he be afraid of this?""It's different!"Hong Yitang was filled with emotions."Hong Qing is inexperienced, and there are even fewer young people around him. There are even fewer capable people around him ... Now, he has become one of the five great commanders of your demon-hunting Army. With your help, he has even stepped into the ninth level of the sun Moon tier and is even at the Dao integration stage!"In this world, how many people could still enter his eyes?As for me, although I'm not an invincible powerhouse, if I really become the master of the great Dao, how many people can enter my eyes?Since you don't care, why don't you ... Marry another one?Li Hao smiled bitterly,"Lin Hongyu, that's just a temporary solution!" "Martial uncle, why do you have to be like this? besides, love should also be free, not feudalistic. The so-called parents 'orders and matchmaking words are all feudalistic. We are martial masters who pursue freedom ...""So what? How could Qing 'er not agree?""No problem, Qing 'er!" Hong Yitang waved his hand."Let's see what you think!"“……”Li Hao's head hurt. What was he doing?We're doing serious business.I treat you like a brother, but you actually want to be my father.This won't do!"Martial uncle, we're doing serious business. We'll talk about it later!""I ..."Li Hao's body suddenly trembled, and the river shook violently. He said anxiously,""Martial uncle, stop chatting. I'm going to retreat. Changhe can't hold on any longer.“"...You bastard!"Hong Yitang felt helpless. What a pity.

2414 Chapter 403
To be honest, he really hoped that he could persuade Li Hao to agree.What a good son-in-law he was!He was simply the only candidate in his heart. In the future, if his daughter really found him a son-in-law, who would he like?He had seen Li Hao and witnessed Li Hao's unparalleled magnificence ... He had almost looked down on himself, let alone someone more outstanding than him in this world.Hong Yitang thought to himself,'there are probably no more people who are more outstanding than me.' Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  So ... If they had to choose, it would be Li Hao.As for the neo martial King and Supreme martial artist ... They either had a wife or were too old, even older than him. Even if they were unparalleled, he was not interested.What a pity, what a pity!He stopped thinking about it and stepped into the river.At the same time, a man walked out of the river. It was Li Hao. At this moment, Li Hao had completely deprived the river of its power. He walked out of the river with his unparalleled body.He began to merge with Li Hao, who was outside.He no longer needed a clone!There were too many disadvantages to using a clone.Even though this was only his physical body, Li Hao was not willing to split it again.Body as one!At this moment, the stars in the sky had been extracted by Li Hao and absorbed into his meridians and acupoints. It was as if the stars had been embedded into his body. It was a terrifying sight.At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be wrapped in a giant dragon.The power in his body was also constantly shaking!Of the 360 stars, 180 were extremely bright, and 180 were slightly dim.The other Dao meridians that had not been opened were all in his body.On the other side, Li Hao's two bodies merged.On the other side, Hong Yitang had completely stepped into the river. The power of the river Washed over the heavens and earth, washing over Hong Yitang. His flesh and blood instantly melted, revealing his white bones!Hong Yitang didn't say a word. His Natal stars also appeared and began to merge into the river. He was slightly different from Li Hao!At this moment, the stars merged into the river and started to melt.It was extremely painful!"Uncle-master ..." Li Hao's expression changed slightly.Hong Yitang's voice came,"you control the Galaxy with the stars, and I merge the Galaxy with the stars!" I am the Dao, and the Dao is me! When I open ten thousand stars and fuse ten thousand DAOs, I will completely become a great Dao!"Hong Yitang's voice was calm,'since we've already done it, we should be more thorough! Could it be that he still had to keep something and leave the stars behind, waiting to escape? Countless people desire to be the master of the great Dao. Li Hao, do I still need to keep the hope of escape?"BOOM!The ripples of the river fused into his blood, his flesh, his essence, his Qi, his spirit, his star Dao meridians ...Compared to Li Hao, Hong Yitang was much more thorough!'If I don't do it, I'll do it. In the future, the truth Dao universe will be me, and I'll be the truth Dao universe.'At this moment, there seemed to be a star shining in the distant void.This time, the time star had actually appeared!Li Hao's expression changed!This thing was attracted here just like that? How troublesome!Those three guys ... Without the time star to chase them, would they run out?Also, Hong Yitang's true body merging with the river had actually attracted the time star ... This was a little unexpected. This meant that in the eyes of the time star, this was an extremely novel and important event closely related to the great Dao.However, at this moment, the star seemed to be a little confused. It seemed to have seen Li Hao and didn't know if it should come or not. It floated in the distance for a while and suddenly ran away!Obviously, they still felt that ... The temptation was not enough. They had just been chased for a while, and it was not necessary to come to this place.And Hong Yitang saw this scene as well.He was not frozen!After merging into the river, he seemed to have much more resistance than before. At this moment, as he watched the stars leave, he felt a little regretful. "It's a pity ... It seems that even if my true body fuses with the river, it's only worth a glance in its eyes. It doesn't have to come!""Uncle-master, it's already amazing that they managed to lure him here. If li daoheng could be lured here, they would have successfully captured him. Why should uncle-master be disappointed?""You might as well not comfort me with this!" Hong Yitang laughed. At this moment, he laughed in a terrifying manner because only half of his body was left with bones.The long river shook!The water in the river was originally very muddy, but at this moment, it had actually turned blood red, as if it had really become blood.Star flash!The great Dao shook slightly.The long river had a new master.And this Dao universe was about to change owners.If Li Hao's control of the great Dao hadn't been too deep, the change of master would've caused an earth-shattering disaster!……Even though the two of them were crossing paths in the great path universe, there were some changes in the outside world.The sky changed!The sky suddenly turned red, as if it was mourning for something, but it didn't seem to be to that extent. The sky was blood red, but there was no blood rain, and there were no other strange signs.The world seemed to be filled with sword intent!That kind of sword intent ... He had seen it before, and it was very rich. It was just that before, it was very ethereal, but today, he felt that it was a little ... Majestic and vigorous!This was the Dao master switching positions!Although they were both swordsmen, there were some differences between them that were almost impossible to distinguish. Li Hao also knew the earth-overturning sword, and he also knew a lot of sword intent.At this moment, it was almost undetectable unless one was an omnipotent expert.……In the northern Li Dynasty.Celestial pole looked up at the sky and frowned slightly.What was going on?Heavenly transformation?Was there something happening in the universe of the great path?Was it the truth Dao universe or the void Dao universe?Was Li Hao training, or were the top three fighting for time stars?

On the side, the king of Dali was also looking at the sky. After a while, he asked curiously,""Senior, don't you feel that the killing intent is a little less?""What?"The Dali King explained,"I was a little uncomfortable before. When Li Hao received the great Dao, I felt ... Uncomfortable!" His killing intent is too strong. It might have something to do with Li Hao's killing intent when he received the great path universe. Now ... He's much better. Did he improve again and calm his killing intent?" That was possible.Was the killing intent too strong?Heaven's Fate didn't feel it deeply.But now, after sensing it carefully, it did seem to be more peaceful than before. The sword essence was still very strong, and there was no big problem.Improved?It was possible.As for the others ... He could not think of anything no matter how hard he racked his brain. As for the great Dao changing Masters ... How could that be possible? unless li daoheng broke through the void Dao universe and entered the truth Dao universe, how could he change Masters?In this era, in this world, there were no more opportunities. The Dao universe was the biggest opportunity, the opportunity to vindicate Dao!No one would give up!If li daoheng had really killed his way into the truth Dao universe, an earth-shattering battle would have erupted.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  He thought to himself but didn't say much. He tried to comprehend it again and indeed felt that the world had become gentler. He said,""Your perception is not bad. Have you finished absorbing the power of the skeleton?""En!"The Dali King nodded slightly and said,"thank you for your help, senior. I'm now a Heavenly King, right?" In this world, I can rank in the top five!"“……”Tian Ji was stunned for a moment, and the Dali King said seriously,""Red Moon Emperor, li daoheng, Zheng Yu, Li Hao ... If we count the seniors, then I'll be sixth. If we don't count, I'll be fifth! Senior doesn't care about fame. As for that woman in the West, I'm not afraid of her!"“……”Celestial pole looked at him strangely.""Is there a difference between you being the fifth or the 500th?"The Dali King thought for a while and nodded,"I'll feel better if I rank high!.""Senior, the ruins of Saturn city are gone. As for the saber ... You have taken it back. Do I need to guard it anymore?"Very good!Since Li Hao did it last time, I don't need to go anymore!Heaven's Fate nodded."There's no need to go there. There's nothing there. Why should we go there?" I'll give you a mission ... To replace the previous mission. ""What?""Go to the seal and suppress the sword city! "Seven of the eight main cities are here, and one city is included. I'm worried that it will be destroyed by others, so I'll send you to the seal. Although your strength is ordinary, you have the power of a Heavenly King. Unless the few people before you personally take action, no one can destroy sword city ... You go and keep watch, in case anyone can destroy it." The Dali King was speechless,"senior, is there any meaning?" I can't destroy it! It doesn't matter if I go or not if I can't destroy it. So, the result will be the same whether I go or not. Why do I have to go there?"Do you not want me to be idle?What he said made sense!However, the celestial pole couldn't bear to see this guy idle around. It was already annoying to owe him a favor, so why didn't he have to be annoyed?Why?You owe me a favor, so of course you have to return it!"You're right, but as the Overlord and King of a region, Silver Moon can be broken by these people at any time ... And I still haven't completed my mission, so I still need some things to help me. Help me solve these small problems!""Senior, please speak!"Heaven's Fate calmly said,'go find Li Hao and ask him for the word' heaven battling '! After that, I still need a portion of heaven's will. Now that you have some strength, I don't care what methods you use, but you must help me capture some heaven's will!"The Dali king's mouth was wide open, and he was speechless.F * ck!Not to mention the latter part, just asking Li Hao for it back ... Wasn't this making things difficult for me?Heaven's Fate frowned."It's a small matter. Ask Li Hao for it. Li Hao will give it to you!" You can't even handle such a small matter? The real problem is that the Heaven's Will is hiding and not easy to capture, you have to find a way yourself! If you leave me, heaven's will might take the initiative to contact you! The faster, the better. I have a bad feeling, maybe ... A shocking battle will break out soon!"King Yan Shen asked,'a shocking battle? Was Li Hao fighting a few experts, or were the three people fighting each other? However, Li Hao's strength is not enough at the moment, and the world can't accommodate a half-step sovereign. Could it be that a venerable sovereign broke the seal?"Tian Ji frowned."I'm not sure. From the looks of it ... There is still some time. For the heaven and earth to accommodate a half-step sovereign, there must be at least one huge change before a half-step sovereign can appear!""By the way, senior, why can you ..."The king of Dali wanted to say,"heaven and earth can't accommodate a half-step sovereign, so why can you continue to exist?"Heaven's Fate rolled his eyes. After splitting the heaven and earth into eight parts, I fell into a deep sleep in this world. The heaven and earth tacitly accepted me as a part of it, so I am a part of it ... Why can't I be here?"The Dali King was stunned. Like this?"It's not because of senior's status as a beginner? His body is strong, so he can withstand it?""It's not a problem to resist it, but to resist it ... Heaven and earth can't resist it?"Heaven's Fate was speechless,'what pig brain do you have? Other people have already seen through it, but you still haven't realized it yet. I've long been a part of the world ... Do you understand?"What beginner's level body ... I've stopped cultivating the beginner's level long ago!Who told you that I'm at the initial stage?He was too lazy to say anything.

He did have a bad feeling that the battle of Silver Moon was about to break out. It wouldn't be too long, much sooner than he had expected, because Li Hao had broken the rules time and time again."Hurry up and help me collect these things ... Otherwise ... Once the war breaks out, there might be a battle between the four Emperors!""Half-Emperor?""Venerable sovereign!""Isn't there only one venerable sovereign?"the king of Dali was stunned again."Nonsense, can't he advance?"Celestial pole felt that the Dali King was very stupid and was somewhat annoyed.""Li daoheng and Zheng Yu have been preparing for 100000 years, it's not like they haven't made any progress at all! At the critical moment, they might be able to prove their Dao as venerable sovereigns. The reason why they didn't do so now was that they hoped to maximize their benefits! When the time comes, there might be a battle between the four Emperors!""But only three ...""Get lost!" Tian Ji was so angry that he almost cried."I'm serious, senior. You're talking about the four Emperors ... You're not talking about Li Hao, are you?"He was annoyed."Li Hao is very talented and talented. He's even peerless in his generation. But you're saying that ... He can become a venerable sovereign very quickly. I still can't believe it!""I'm going to do something!""Cut the crap!" Tian Ji said coldly. Besides, it wasn't anything strange to become a monarch, what was there to not believe? Moreover, the venerable sovereigns here are far inferior to the venerable sovereigns of new martial arts ... Even Hong Yue is not a true venerable sovereign. After being tortured for 100000 years, she has lost her connection with the Crimson Moon great cosmos and the support of the Crimson Moon great Dao ... She is indeed a venerable sovereign, but she is far inferior to the normal venerable sovereigns!"Alright!The king of Dali said nothing more, but he still found it hard to believe.Would Li Hao become a venerable Emperor soon?I don't really believe it!No matter how weak a venerable sovereign was ... They were still venerable sovereigns. It was incredible that there was one in a small world. From what this person said, these people all had the hope of becoming venerable sovereigns?Was it that scary?"Senior, if they become venerable sovereigns, will we be in danger?""It's you who's in danger, what does it have to do with me?""Get lost!" Celestial pole snorted coldly.The king of Dali was a little angry and did not say anything more. This person ... Was really impolite.Without saying anything more, the Dali King left in an instant. Work still had to be done, otherwise, this person would beat people up.Recently, he had discovered that this person was a little irritable.In the past, he didn't care about anything, but recently, he seemed to want to manage some things. He didn't know if it was because he had been lonely for too long.The celestial pole didn't care about him and continued to observe.He silently sensed for a while and was slightly puzzled.The Dali King's perception was good, so he didn't pay much attention to it. At this moment, he sensed again, and this world ... Was indeed a little gentler. It was no longer as harsh, violent, and cold as Li Hao 's.  Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Li Hao looked easy to talk to, but he was very cold-blooded deep down. Perhaps it had something to do with his family being killed. At that time, he was determined to kill Ying Hongyue, so he was absolutely cold to the bone.Could it be that he had changed after killing Ying Hongyue?He was a little suspicious, but he didn't think about it.Thinking too much would tire him out.……At this moment, in the universe of the great path, the stars were completely shattered and merged into the long river.The long river also began to fluctuate like a sword or a person. Blood vessels seemed to have appeared, and a face vaguely appeared in the long river, causing huge waves to rise!Rays of light connected the Galaxy in the sky.The Galaxy was bright and reflected the long river.Hong Yitang's voice rang out,'from now on, I'll advance and retreat together with the Silver Moon people and silver Moon Dao! Dao begets, I beget! The Dao is strong, I am strong! If the Dao rises, I'll rise!"BOOM!The river trembled, and the next moment, the river turned into a person.Hong Yitang's aura grew stronger and stronger. He walked toward Li Hao step by step. At this moment, he suddenly raised his head and opened his mouth. All the stars flew into his stomach, and countless stars fell into his mouth."You're not willing to bind me ... I'm happy to do so. Since that's the case ... Let the Galaxy enter my stomach. I'll be Silvermoon's father ..."Li Hao laughed leisurely,'the stomach swallows thousands of stars like a pregnant woman, so how can he be Silver moon's father? It has to be the mother of Silvermoon!"Hong Yitang smiled. The next moment, he slashed his sword at Li Hao.BOOM!With a loud noise, Li Hao actually took a step back, but Hong Yitang didn't move an inch.""Don't be disrespectful! The sword pool is my territory! Now, you're an outsider!"Li Hao laughed. He looked around and nodded."Martial uncle is right. It seems like you've gained a lot this time. You're even at the fifth or sixth level of the Dao integration realm now. You're really progressing at a tremendous pace!"His rate of improvement was frighteningly fast, but the price he paid was not small either. He completely destroyed his physical body and fused with the ten thousand DAOs.From now on, he would be bound to the Silvermoon myriad DAOs."Perhaps ... This is the path of the human Emperor!"Li Hao suddenly said,"water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize a boat!" Martial uncle, perhaps the Silver Moon inheritance still has to fall into your hands. Otherwise, if there's no one from the Silver Moon to cultivate this Dao, martial uncle's strength will gradually decline. "Hong Yitang smiled and nodded, not saying anything. "Then I'll turn into a long river again, and you'll stay as you did before ... I won't go out again!"He could go out, but if he went out now, it would be easy for the top-notch existences to detect his problem.From today on, he would no longer leave the Dao universe.Moreover, he also remembered that Li Hao had said that he would face a calamity that might erupt when he was dealing with a half-step sovereign or even a venerable sovereign. Hong Yitang also needed to cultivate and strengthen himself again so that he could help Li Hao block this crisis at the critical moment.

At this moment, Li Hao's Dao meridians were in a mess, and his stars were on a rampage.Hearing this, he nodded and said,"alright!" "I also need to make some preparations. The Dao Meridian has entered my body, but currently, I'm still lacking something ... At the very least, I need to condense 180 sword intent stars to correspond with each other and merge the real and the fake!"At present, he had condensed close to 140 sword essence stars in his spiritual world, and he had comprehended more than 180 sword essences. However, he needed some help to quickly condense them successfully. "Do you need my help?""No need!"Li Hao shook his head,'mental energy is momentum, and momentum is formed! I have to go to Dali and find that person. I need to borrow the blood saber and use the power of the blood Emperor to help me! Let him return the favor so that he doesn't feel burdened. ""What?""You ..." Hong Yitang was stunned again.Borrowing the blood saber to return the favor?This ...In his opinion, that person was still of great use. At a critical moment, Li Hao could make use of that person and even get rid of one of the top three!Li Hao shook his head, why? "It doesn't make much sense. You helped me to intimidate Red Moon sovereign once. This time, you lent me your saber and helped me build my force. We're even!" I schemed against him with no real intention, just to intimidate the red moon Emperor ... If I succeed this time, it doesn't matter if he's there or not!""I don't owe anyone favors, and they don't have to owe me forever ... We're even!""Alright!" Hong Yitang thought for a while and nodded."As long as it's to my liking!""En!"Li Hao laughed,"it's to go according to my heart's desire!" He was probably very angry right now. In fact, he didn't need to be thick-skinned to owe someone a favor. If he was angry ... It meant that he wasn't thick-skinned enough! I've discovered that the neo martial human King has a good eye for things. The experts left behind from the same generation are all amazing people. If he can walk out of Silver Moon, I'd like to get to know him!"Hong Yitang smiled bitterly."Aren't you afraid that he'll kill you with one strike? I heard that he's very violent and protective. You've killed many neo martial artists.""What are you saying!"Li Hao said innocently,"I killed people according to my will. The people I killed were all worth killing. Uncle-master, you really underestimated the human King. He must be extraordinary to be able to reach that level!" Forget it, let's not talk about this. I'll leave first!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.Hong Yitang shook his head slightly. The next moment, he thought of something and suddenly scolded with a smile,""Kid, you run so fast. You haven't taken the divine text of the Dao word with you. No wonder you can travel freely ..."Kachaa!Just as he finished speaking, the divine text of the great Dao in the void suddenly collapsed!Hong Yitang's expression changed drastically!At this moment, the divine text of the great Dao suddenly exuded the power of all kinds of DAOs and merged into a new character.In the river, a 'sword' character suddenly flashed and devoured the power of countless Dao characters.At this moment, the entire great Dao trembled again.It seemed that the previous exchange was not complete. Now, the exchange was complete.Hong Yitang's expression was a little ugly. He gritted his teeth.""Why do you have to do this?"Did he really not want it at all?Not even a little?You're only a Dao integration expert, not a venerable sovereign!'Leave the Dao text and you can still come back. There's still hope for you to take over this place again, you little bastard!'He was a little angry!The preservation of the Dao text was agreed upon and suggested by Li Hao himself. If the Dao text was preserved, Li Hao would have hope to take over the Dao again. Once Hong Yitang died in battle, he would be able to take over the Dao successfully!But now ... Li Hao had cut off all hope of taking over!"Bastard!"At this moment, Hong Yitang was a little angry.Why?Do you think I would be worried about this?You've even given me the great Dao universe. Would I be dissatisfied with this?……Outside the Dao universe, Li Hao walked out of the Dao universe. He looked up and chuckled, his face slightly pale.Since he had already handed it over ... He might as well hand it over completely.Why leave a back door?I'm not interested in going through the back door!As long as the divine text of the word "Dao" was still in his hands, Hong Yitang would not be considered a true Dao master in the true Dao universe. The divine text of the word "Dao" was a gift from the heaven and earth and the great Dao when he comprehended the Dao!The key to the Dao universe! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Now, he had given the house to someone else, but he still kept the key. More importantly, he couldn't change the lock of Hong Yitang. In this case, there was no difference whether he gave it or not. "I'll do as I please in this world! Gallop across the martial world on a horse!"At this moment, Li Hao began to sing a song. Sometimes, Silver Moon martial masters liked to hum a few lines."I'm not born with you, and I'm not going to die with you. I'm all alone in the world, and I've seen injustice on the road. I'm just a chivalrous hero. I don't ask for your gratitude, I just want to have a clear conscience!"Master, perhaps I'm still the same Silver Moon Martial Master. The martial arts world is so big that Silver Moon can't let me go!……Li Dynasty.When Li Hao spoke,"lend me your blood saber, and I'll write off the power of eight meridians," Heaven's Fate was stunned.In the main hall.Li Hao crossed his legs and drank the strong wine. While Heaven's Fate was still in a daze, he laughed heartily and said,""Senior, please lend me your blood saber. I won't interfere with the cat's resurrection. I just want to use the blood Emperor's power to help me comprehend Dao! I, Li Hao, always keep my word!""You ... You're saying that we're even? "Heaven's Fate looked at him in a daze."Of course!""Is this true?""It's true!""Why? "Heaven's Fate looked at him in a daze."There's no reason. I need Blood Blade to help me. That's the reason! If I need it, everything is worth it! If I don't need it, everything is not worth it!""Do you know that I don't owe people easily ... If you ask, I promise I will kill Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and red Moon Emperor's clone! Even if I have to die Here!"It was powerful and resonating!At this moment, the powerhouse seemed to feel a little humiliated. I can hide, but you can't humiliate me!"No need!""You don't think I can do it?""No!"Li Hao shook his head."I just want to learn something. I can kill people myself." Senior, why are you forcing me?"“……”艹!Heaven's Fate was furious. What was this?Was this human language?I'm just borrowing a knife for enlightenment, and I'm not even as good as a F * cking knife?He had been on tenterhooks for the past few days, constantly thinking about how this little rascal would scheme against him ... In the blink of an eye, he had come. Let me tell you, don't think too highly of yourself. I don't want what you owe me. I want it back now, and we're even.Why ... Why was he so upset?"Are you sure?" celestial pole was a little angry. Don't try to goad me into it, it's meaningless. If you say it now, no matter how difficult it is, I'll help you solve some ... You can say it later, I'm not happy!""Borrow a knife!""You ...""Senior, you're not going to lend it to me?""I'm borrowing!""Scram!" The blood saber appeared, and Heaven's Fate was furious."Get lost!"Li Hao laughed and grabbed his long saber. Violent fluctuations burst out from the long saber, and Emperor's might swept across the world. The celestial pole instantly suppressed it. "Get lost!"Li Hao laughed again. He grabbed the suppressed saber and instantly disappeared.Until he really left ... Celestial pole went crazy and flew into a rage."Bastard!"This old man is so angry!My favor is nothing, right?Li Hao, is this what you mean?F * ck your ancestors!Forget it. If he really has an ancestor, she's the grandniece of the sword Saint.At this moment, Tian Ji was furious, but he didn't know why he was angry.The favor was gone and returned. He should be happy, shouldn't he?Why was she angry?But ... But it was really uncomfortable. It was so uncomfortable that she wanted to kill someone. It was so uncomfortable that she couldn't sleep. It was so uncomfortable that she wanted to go crazy.

After leaving the Li Dynasty, Li Hao only felt that he was full of joy and courage.'If I were a few years older, I might not be able to resist the temptation of this person. He took the initiative to speak and killed one of the three ... What kind of temptation is this?'However, at this moment, Li Hao was not tempted.I don't want to!"I don't want it. I just want this saber. I'll just comprehend it."He roamed the void and the world.……After a long time, at the original ruins of star suppression city.Li Hao entered with his saber.The bloody saber trembled as if it did not want to be held by Li Hao. It was the saber of a venerable sovereign and had a mission. It did not want Li Hao to take the saber.At this moment, Li Hao said, I'll gather the bloodlines of eight families for you to eat! That expert wants to return my favor, but I'm doing it not for him, but for you. You devoured the bloodlines of eight families and owe me a favor, so what's wrong with letting me gain enlightenment? Whether it's a knife or a cat, you can owe money and not return it?"The long blade trembled slightly.Even if the saber of a venerable sovereign was not as intelligent as the old turtle, it still had some spirituality after so many years.Whether it was a knife or a cat, how could he not return the favor he owed?Although he could also gather the bloodlines of eight families, how many years and months would it take?The long saber no longer trembled.It was as if he had accepted this favor.Li Hao smiled,"that's right!" All things have a spirit, and the neo martial saber should also carry on the spirit of neo martial. Martial Dao must be fought, and only with effort can there be gains. You are the opportunity I fought for, and similarly, I have also fought for opportunities for you ... How can you not return it?"All living things have spirits?The long saber trembled slightly. Sabers also had a spirit, right?At this moment, the long saber stopped shaking and a faint Emperor's might overflowed. A cat was still sleeping in the saber. Li Hao glanced at it curiously.It was said that this cat was not a real living creature.This was another projection of the void.Was projection ... Similar to the past and the future? it could be drawn back but not killed, absorbed, or merged. It allowed the other party to exist. Was this the origin of the cat of the knife?If that was the case ... To be able to fix the existence of another void in the world and even give it life ... It was simply unimaginable.At the very least, Li Hao couldn't do that at the moment.It didn't matter if he was pulling the past or projecting the future ... At the very least, it was impossible for him to keep such an existence in the world. It was clear that the power of the blood Emperor was unparalleled!In the past, in the two words "Zhan Tian," he had seen the other party split the world into eight with one strike. Now, it seemed that it was just bravery. To be able to keep the projection of the cat and to resurrect, that was Dao! Li Hao stared at the cat in the saber. This cat was chubby. If this was Emperor Cang's projection, did he look like this too?Its fur was slightly fiery red.He looked a little furious! Li Hao looked at him curiously. In the new martial era, the cat seemed inevitable. However, many people didn't know that the legendary Emperor Cang was actually a cat. He could only call him Emperor!"For a cat ... To be able to reach that stage ... It's incredible!"Li Hao mumbled. The cat of the blade seemed to be breathing.This cat had been in this world for many years. The blood Emperor had come to the Silvermoon small world more than once. Perhaps it had come for the cat. It was obvious how important it was."Senior saber, senior cat ... Today, I'm going to trace back the power of the venerable sovereign and comprehend the saber intent of the blood Emperor. Time may flow, or changes may occur ... There's no need to be nervous!"The long saber trembled and let out a crisp sound, as if it was saying,"ridiculous."We'll be nervous?You might not know our background!We've watched the human ruler slaughter the heavenly Emperor, the four Emperors fight the nine emperors, and we've traveled to the origin universe ... What else can make us nervous?"Very good!"Li Hao nodded and smiled, as if he understood the meaning of the long saber.That was good!He didn't say anything else. The world started to spin. At this moment, one man, one knife, and one cat seemed to appear in another void."Blood saber!"A cry of surprise came from the void.It was the cry of one of the three strongest world guardians, the blade of the blood Emperor!"Emperor Cang!""It's ... It's not Emperor Cang ..."Another person was shocked. What did Li Hao get?Li Hao didn't reply. Instead, he said,""I'm going to draw out the blood Emperor's saber intent, merge it with my sword intent, and take the strong points of a hundred schools! Sword Saint, blood Emperor, human King, Zheng Yu, li daoheng, these people are all worth learning from!""Three seniors, while you're stabilizing your spirit sea, I hope that you'll be able to comprehend a thing or two in the process and advance further! After this, I might have to open a temporary Dao world and combine reality with illusion. I hope it won't break the world created by you three seniors!"Heaven and earth trembled.The sword tree and the other two were shocked.Virtual reality as one?Was that even possible?Well, no matter what, they didn't have any thoughts now, so they just had to become stronger and prevent themselves from bursting. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  ……Li Hao stopped thinking about it. A long river appeared. Different from the river of chaos, this River gathered more than a hundred stars. One of them looked like a time star, but it was actually a simulation. It was the core of the bright moon sword intent, a star forged by the sword intent of time.The river was not turbid, but very clear.Different from the chaotic River in the universe of DAOs, the river of chaos gathered tens of thousands of DAOs. Li Hao did not actually comprehend them. He only knew some of them but did not know why.

However, he knew that the stars here were all formed by the sword essence. They were the sword essence that he had truly comprehended.This was the biggest difference between the two!The river of chaos was truly chaotic. Although it was powerful, Li Hao couldn't actually use much of his strength. It was the opposite here. The river was ordinary, but Li Hao could use all his strength.One was formed from billions of stars and millions of people.One was formed by Li Hao's own sword principle comprehension. One represented the will of the people, one represented Li Hao's unique will, one gathered the strength of everyone, and one was just Li Hao's personal show.The river appeared in Li Hao's mind. He glanced at it and then at the saber."Going back to the past ... Saber intent explosion! Don't break my spiritual world. I heard that the blood Emperor is extremely powerful. A blade that can't control its power is not a good blade!""Qiang!"A crisp sound of metal vibrating was heard. The bloody saber didn't seem to be satisfied with Li Hao's words.What did he say?I can't control my own power?Who are you underestimating?The next moment, the long river surrounded him, the sword intent washed over him, and time reversed. The blood saber fluctuated in the long river, and the sound of waves emerged.The saber itself had a powerful saber intent.But this was not what Li Hao was after.He wanted to see the true saber intent!The next moment, the words 'heaven-battling' appeared. This way, it would be easier to draw out the real blade of the blood Emperor.The saber intent was getting stronger and stronger!The small world in his spirit sea trembled a little. At this moment, Li Hao couldn't help but sigh again. The foundation of this small world was well used. The tree, seal, and Whetstone of a Supreme Sword were all used!They were all existences that could withstand the sword mind of the sword Saint and not break!Otherwise, the three sages would be useless to ordinary humans or demons. They would be directly destroyed by the will of the venerable sovereign. However, these three sages were simply a stroke of genius!The long river flowed and constantly washed away the past.What Li Hao wanted was not just some saber Dao. He wanted to ... Wash out the blood Emperor's shadow and even fight with him. He wanted to have a real fight with a former venerable sovereign!Even if ... It was very dangerous.So what?The powerful qi and blood was like an ocean of blood. It emerged on the long saber bit by bit, as if it was illusory.Li Hao had come into contact with the blood Emperor's Phantom a long time ago.However, they were both separated by space and time, and the two sides had never really had any contact. This time, Li Hao hoped that his opponent could form a sea!Suddenly, waves of sword essence burst out and stimulated the long saber.The firmament sword appeared in Li Hao's hand, and a special force was forced out of it. The firmament sword trembled continuously. Li Hao said,""Spit out all the bloodline power of the eight great families!"The firmament sword was originally a substitute for the starry sky sword, and it had once devoured the divine weapons of the eight great families, so it also possessed a large amount of the eight great families "bloodline.At this moment, Li Hao was forcing out a large amount of power.The firmament sword didn't seem too happy!It was easy to swallow, but hard to spit it out.Li Hao's voice rang out again,"no destruction, no construction!" Although the bloodline of the eight great families isn't bad, but you ... If you really want to advance a step further, you can only give up! And now, I've comprehended the bright moon sword essence, with time as my master! You have the power of the eight great families "bloodline, but it's interfering with me ... If you don't want to spit it out, I'm worried that you'll be weak for a while ... In order to better adapt to my bright moon sword intent in the future, I can only forcibly crush you and reforge you, or ... Give up on you!""The swords...When there is no master, you can do whatever you want, but now that you have a master, the sword is the master's weapon. You hesitated once and twice, which means that you don't trust me. If that's the case ... Perhaps ... After a few years, you will be abandoned by me in the universe, just like the real starry sky sword!"Li Hao's voice was cold.A sword without an owner could be used at will."But now, you have a master, so you should listen to him. Even if he wants you to self-destruct, you should do it without thinking.The sword venerable had thrown the starry sky sword away. Perhaps it was not strong enough, or perhaps it was no longer handy. What was the use of keeping an unsuspecting sword?The firmament sword shuddered.A moment later, the power of the eight bloodlines began to flow out.All of this was born from its devouring of many things. A large amount of the power of the eight meridians gushed out and was absorbed by the blood saber. The blood saber seemed to be a little excited. The cat in the saber seemed to open its mouth again and devour all the power.In fact, Li Hao had already seen through the so-called power of the eight meridians. The power of the eight meridians was the initial power of the Silvermoon world. It was absorbed by the eight main cities, transferred to the saber, and absorbed by the cat.He would use the purest power of heaven and earth to nurture this cat, hoping that it could be resurrected.As the blood saber absorbed the power of the eight meridians, a sea of blood appeared on the saber.The blood sea trembled!An extremely illusory shadow gradually began to appear.Li Hao became more and more aged.This was the case when using the power of time. The more you used, the more you would consume. Without the river of chaos, Li Hao's lifespan was actually not that long, but Li Hao did not care too much.At this moment, he was thinking about his future self.He was so old and experienced.Did he ... Also give up the river of chaos, causing his lifespan to be seriously damaged? p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Otherwise, with the river of chaos and the nourishment of the people, would the people grow old so quickly?
