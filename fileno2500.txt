And people like Emperor Cang were at the peak of venerable sovereigns. In comparison ... Lin Hongyu felt that there was no need to go against these neo martial artists for a cat.But Li Hao laughed."Senior, there's no need to say this. I didn't say I was going to take the cat ... Besides, senior second cat has his own thoughts. It's not like he's an item that I can take whenever I want.""I'm just giving you a reminder!"Heaven's Fate looked indifferent, but he was cursing in his heart. 'If I don't warn you, what if you really take it away?Li Hao didn't continue this topic. He looked outside and said,""Did anything else happen while I was in deep sleep?""No, I didn 't!"Lin Hongyu did not want to argue with him anymore. She quickly said,""The time was too short. Even Qian Wuliang didn't move! He's a smart person. Unless he's absolutely sure that you can't be resurrected, otherwise ... He would never rebel at this moment!""Is Qian Wuliang controlling Phantom path part of your plan?" he asked with some doubt."There's no plan!"Li Hao chuckled."You're thinking too much. If everything was planned, I would be an omnipotent God!" Of course, if li daoheng or Zheng Yu really can't defeat me and want to disgust me ... They might do so, but it's just one of the possibilities. The greater possibility is to blow up the void Dao universe. "A plan?It wasn't a plan.It could only be said that it was one of the thousands of possibilities, and the probability was actually very small.If Zheng Yu hadn't reached that stage and hadn't been schemed against by li daoheng ... How could this be possible? he had done this to disgust li daoheng.Li Hao continued,"Qian Wuliang won't betray us, at least not now!" The unforeseen event I'm talking about is li daoheng. ""Li daoheng?""He's dead!"Lin Hongyu was stunned. He was struck to death by lightning, and even his great Dao was severed. "Even bone erosion Emperor was dead, let alone li daoheng.They would die together!Li Hao thought for a moment and shook his head, he won't die so easily! Even if a great Dao is broken, it's only a great Dao of origins. He also cultivated a new Dao. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to devour the power of Zheng Yu's new Dao!""It's just that the power of the new Dao is limited, so it's not very useful. "Lin Hongyu became nervous.""He's still alive?"Then ... Wouldn't that be troublesome?"It doesn't matter if you're alive, your strength is not as good as before.""Let's go and see him!"He suddenly thought of something."What?"Lin Hongyu was stunned. 'You know where he is?'Heaven's Fate was also a little puzzled. 'I don't even know, but you do?'"That Taoist sword is him?""No."Li Hao shook his head."Follow me and you'll know!"Heaven's Fate was also a little curious. At this moment, he didn't say anything and just followed to take a look.Li daoheng didn't die? The three of them instantly disappeared.……The Silvermoon world was still expanding.Meanwhile, the citizens of Silver Moon began to make preparations for Li Hao's resurrection.At the end of the world.Near the Stargate.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Suddenly, three figures appeared.At this moment, a small courtyard stood beside the Stargate that no one dared to touch.Anping residence.On the starry sky sword, there was a courtyard that originally existed. It was also the residence of the sword Saint, which had been left behind by the human King.At this moment, a man was sitting in the courtyard with a long sword on his back. He turned to look at Li Hao and smiled. "You're here?"It was as if he had predicted that Li Hao would return.And Li Hao seemed to have concluded that this person was here.Li Hao stepped into the void.In the back, Heaven's Fate and Lin Hongyu were both shocked. This person was actually still alive?It was unbelievable!Li daoheng's long hair fluttered in the wind. He was wearing a green sword robe, and his face was calm."Sit!"Li Hao sat down.The two of them sat separately at a stone table.He didn't look at the celestial pole or Lin Hongyu. His aura wasn't too strong, but it was full of sword intent. He looked at Li Hao."I knew you wouldn't die so easily!""I also know that you won't die so easily," Li Hao added."Do you want to drink?" Li Hao smiled."Your wine is not old enough."Li daoheng took out a jar of wine, and a wine cup appeared out of thin air. It was filled in an instant and dropped in front of Li Hao. Li Hao picked up the wine cup and drank it in one gulp. Endless sword intent erupted in his body!He silently sensed it, and after a long time, he sighed."Impressive. Your comprehension of the sword is deeper than mine!""A hundred thousand years. He's a pig, but he's made some progress."Li daoheng, on the other hand, was calm. He looked at Li Hao."However, I have some doubts. Why are you so sure that I am here?""You've obtained the true inheritance of Sword Saint, and there's no place for you to go in the world now. The Stargate hasn't opened yet, where else can you go if not here? You also know that I won't die so easily, and I'll find you sooner or later. Zheng Yu said that you've been like a mouse for the past 100000 years, and I'm afraid you're not convinced. Since that's the case ... Why don't you stay in Anping?"Li daoheng nodded,"that's true!" Where else can I go?"He laughed, picked up the wine jar, and drank it all in one go.His face was unruly, arrogant, and disdainful.""What is Zheng Yu? He thought he was the master of everything! Of course, I'm nothing. If I had the ability, I wouldn't have ended up like this!""Sword Saint once said, those who learn from me live, and those who follow me die ... In the family, it is an honor to have Sword Saint as a member, but it is also a burden!"Li daoheng suddenly brought up something irrelevant."Just like Zhang an. Is he not talented? Was he not talented? Wasn't he working hard enough? Actually, that wasn't the case ... Because with the predecessors here, the more arrogant one was, the harder it would be to go far! If you just want to learn, you can easily obtain Heavenly Kings, half-step sovereigns, and even weak venerable sovereigns!"

"If it's a mediocre person like senior Empyrean pole, he's actually at ease and can go far even if he doesn't aim for first place!"Celestial pole was somewhat dissatisfied!Li daoheng didn't care and continued,""On the other hand, people like us, who are said to have unparalleled talent but are not truly unparalleled, have high ambitions but weak foundations, are said to be the strongest but are not infinitely strong ... These people are actually the most uncomfortable!"He looked at Li Hao and said, if I'm willing to learn and not change, I can become a pseudo-Emperor without any difficulty! I'm willing to leave with venerable swordsman ... Maybe I can become a venerable sovereign ... But I'm too ambitious. I don't want to learn, but I can't integrate it. I deserve what I have today!"These words were difficult for ordinary people to understand.Li Hao, however, understood and nodded."You don't understand!"Li Hao shook his head."I understand. My master is also a very talented Martial Master. I've actually experienced what you've just said." If she learned from him, her achievements would not be low. However, if she wanted to get rid of his influence, be ambitious, and find her own way out ... That would be very difficult! To be honest, I also feel that I'm not the strongest in terms of martial arts talent. ""Fortunately, my master has a good point ..."Li Hao paused and smiled."He's not strong. I'm stronger than him. I broke the seal he placed on me!" If he is as powerful as venerable the sword, I think I will be in despair too!"Li daoheng sighed and nodded,"now that you've put it that way, it makes sense!" "Thus ... In my opinion, Zhang an is more talented than his brother and sister, but he's not strong enough to surpass the zhizun realm. Thus ... I'll only give him a 5% chance. As for me, I believe that in the Li family, I'm the most talented person besides venerable the sword, but I couldn't surpass him ... And I'm not willing to learn from him completely. I'm proud and arrogant, and it's hard to surpass him. It's reasonable that I'll eventually walk towards destruction!""Senior Empyrean pole, for example, knows his own limits. He's not as good as his father, not as good as the human Emperor and the others ... He'll just follow the old path. He won't try to surpass them, he'll just try to imitate them and become a venerable sovereign.""Not wrong!" Celestial pole laughed.There was nothing wrong with what he said.Li daoheng nodded slightly,"senior's attitude ... Is actually your greatest advantage. If it were me, I wouldn't have such an attitude!" "Many years ago, right here, the revered Sword Master told me that if I could break through the boundary, my future would be limitless. If I couldn't ... I would be shrouded by him for the rest of my life and would not have a good ending. When I heard that, I was not convinced and unwilling, but I also believed that I could break through ...""No," he said, shaking his head."The facts have proven that I've failed!"He laughed."I've gone to a dead end. I thought I could do it. In fact, perhaps I'm just a joke in the eyes of the revered sword!""Probably," Li Hao nodded."You're very direct!"Li daoheng laughed."Why are you beating around the bush?"Li Hao also laughed,"inferior means inferior!" Times are different. In fact, in terms of talent, you and I may not be worse than our seniors, but we live in a different era. As the saying goes, times make heroes. "Since you are not from that era ... It will be difficult for you to feel the characteristics of that era! "Sometimes, hard work, hard work, and talent can't even match up to the times. If you don't catch up with the times ... It's hard to surpass them."Li daoheng was deep in thought and nodded slightly,""Is this a consolation? I guess so!"He smiled and took out another jar of wine. "Let's have a drink. Although you're young, you've comprehended a lot. Your mentality is actually better than mine!"Li Hao didn't refuse.Another cup of wine entered his stomach.As he savored the taste, li daoheng continued to drink his own.After a long while, just as Lin Hongyu and the others were getting impatient, li daoheng spoke,""I want to try again!" "Alright!""My sword is unparalleled!"Li daoheng looked at him and said,""A sword competition! If you fail this time, I'll leave all the sword intent to you. You can learn it or give it to me, it's all yours! If I win ...""Yes." He paused for a moment before he said,"I left the sword intent to my good-for-nothing brother ... Consider it my compensation to him!"Whether they won or lost, the result would be the same.Li Hao's return meant his death.There was no such thing as mutual sympathy between heroes. It did not exist. He was not a hero.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao ... Could he be counted?Perhaps!"Sure!" Li Hao nodded.At this moment, li daoheng's battle strength wasn't strong. He could barely be considered a half-step sovereign. In reality, there was still a gap. If they really fought, he would die.However, in a sword battle, the other party had immersed himself in the way of the sword for 100000 years, so his sword Dao was very strong.Li Hao's sword might not be as good as his.At this moment, celestial pole said,"I'll be the middle man!" I'll supervise this battle. What do you think?" "I have no objections!" Li daoheng nodded."Sure!" Li Hao laughed.In an instant, the two of them disappeared. In the sky above the peaceful residence, a special void appeared. The two of them stood opposite each other, one man and one sword, their sword intent overflowing.He drew his sword!It was calm and silent when the swords touched.The two swords were at the same level, and they both retreated.Lin Hongyu and Heaven's Fate just watched. They didn't see anything special about it. It was just a basic sword move that came into contact with each other and then retracted.One strike, two strikes, three strikes ...Gradually, Lin Hongyu started to frown. This was too ordinary and plain.Both of them drew their swords, and they retracted their swords as soon as they made contact.There was no battle that could destroy the world, no power to cut through the void, only ordinary.

2502 Chapter 416
……At this moment, Li Hao attacked again in the air. The 181st attack!Time seemed to have passed as the sword was drawn.The other party also struck out with his sword. With a single strike, he destroyed everything.The two swords collided!In an instant, the firmament sword trembled, and the sword in li daoheng's hand turned into ashes, leaving nothing behind.Jian Wu!Li daoheng glanced at Li Hao. After a long time, he chuckled."The sword of time ... How interesting!"As soon as he finished speaking, his figure dissipated with a self-deprecating tone.""Actually, I lost long ago, didn't I? Li Hao, you're more polite than the human King. At least you're willing to give me a chance. If you're the human King ... I probably won't have such an opportunity!"Li Hao looked at it in silence, then at the sword in his hand. There was a burn mark on it. He said softly,""I'm not as good as you in swordsmanship, but there's no need to be humble. You've absorbed the destructive will of the chaotic lightning. Otherwise, the lightning wouldn't have been able to defeat time ..."Li daoheng's body continued to collapse, turning into streaks of sword will. His voice was still calm."Competing with swords isn't just about swords, it's also about Dao! In fact, I understood it long ago! It's just that I'm not willing! "The sword venerable has long reached the point where the sword is the form and the Dao is the foundation. As for me, I'm still far from it. I'm still pursuing the form without the foundation! The origin of the sword is cultivation, cultivation, cultivation, and cultivation. It's just an obsession ...""You're actually more open-minded than I am. You know that the sword is about its form. It's just its form. If it's not as good as it is, then give up ... I've been persistent for a hundred thousand years. If I gave up early, I might still have a chance. But if I gave up early, I'm not li daoheng anymore. This is my personality. I've been stubborn my entire life!"After saying that, he laughed."Actually ... I didn't want to die in your hands. For the past 100000 years, my only dream was to take the sword of venerable Swordmaster. I thought that I would be killed by venerable Swordmaster!""I've killed the entire Li family just for this day!"Li daoheng's voice was cold,"although venerable the sword taught me sword will, he was unwilling to use his sword on me. I think ... I'll die without any regrets if I can take his sword!" Since he's not willing, then I'll wait for him to attack me!"Li Hao frowned slightly,'if the sword of a sword venerable is aimed at his own people, he's not a sword venerable! You're really stubborn. ""Maybe!"Li daoheng's laughter echoed."You don't have to tell Li Daozong that I died again ... I died before anyway. There's no point in telling him again!"  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  "Alright!"Li Hao nodded. In front of him, the figure had completely disappeared, leaving behind only a flash of sword intent that was like a Thunderbolt.At that moment, both Heaven's Fate and Lin Hongyu were surprised.Lin Hongyu quickly floated into the air. She looked at the sword intent, then at Li Hao, and said warily,""He ... Did he fake his death again?"The primal Chaos lightning couldn't kill him!The key was ... Knowing that Li Hao could be resurrected, the other party had been waiting here. Moreover, the two of them had only exchanged a simple blow, not using many powerful moves, and Li daoheng had already died?Was there a conspiracy?"He didn't fake his death, he's really dead." Li Hao sighed and suddenly shook his head."This guy is too proud, too stubborn, and too ruthless!"Too ruthless?Kill the Li family?At this moment, Li Hao's long river World suddenly appeared.Lin Hongyu took a closer look and was slightly stunned. The long river World was filled with lightning, as if it was chaotic lightning!She was stunned for a moment. What was this?"It was left behind by his final sword strike!"Li Hao's body gradually collapsed, but he soon recovered. In the river, Li Hao quickly wrapped up the destructive Thunder and suppressed it in the depths of the river.Beside him, Heaven's Fate was also amazed,'this guy's sword intent is really strong! It actually seeped into your inner world ... I almost misjudged you!"Li Hao nodded."He's actually reached his limit by learning from venerable sword. It's just that he's too stubborn and unwilling to condense the longevity sword intent. When the chaotic lightning appeared, he thought of using the chaotic lightning as the core, just like how I used time as the core ... However, this thing hurts both himself and others. If he condensed the longevity sword before the tenth lightning bolt, he might have a chance to fight me!"Then, he looked at Lin Hongyu and explained,""The 10th lightning bolt was a gamble. He used his body and sword bones as fuel to ignite his sword intent. He paid the price of breaking his original great Dao to form the primal Chaos lightning sword! In the 181st sword, I used time against Thunder. If it wasn't for the fact that his strength was severely damaged, time wouldn't have been as powerful as Thunder!"Lin Hongyu did not care about this. She said seriously,""Did the lightning affect you when it entered the river?" As for the rest ... She couldn't be bothered to care what li daoheng wanted to do. Didn't he still die in the end?"A little!"Li Hao nodded and looked at the sky."Originally, when I walked out of the Silver Moon, there was a 50% chance that I would attract the chaotic lightning. After his torture, there's at least a 90% chance!"It didn't seem to make much of a difference.Of course, the danger seemed to have increased.But Li Hao had already done it twice, so Lin Hongyu felt that a third time shouldn't be a problem.This was good!She then looked to the side at the sword intent left behind by the other party when he died.""How do we deal with this?""Without the chaotic lightning, it's just the longevity sword intent. If I fully comprehend it, I'll have a chance to become a venerable sovereign. I'll be considered fair and peaceful, without his stubbornness and lightning ... Since he defeated me with his last strike, I'll give it to the ninth master as per his conditions!""Then ..." Lin Hongyu was slightly worried."It's fine!"Li Hao shook his head and grabbed the sword intent. Sure enough, it was extremely peaceful. In fact, it contained countless sword intents, and they were all well-organized. When they were combined, they might become the real longevity sword.

2503 Chapter 416
It was a pity that li daoheng wasn't willing to walk the path of the revered sword completely, otherwise ...Of course, Li Hao didn't feel that it was a pity.Proud people always felt that they were different from others, but wasn't he the same?However, some people failed, and some people succeeded. It was precisely because of this determination that there were cases of later generations surpassing their predecessors. Otherwise, they could only rely on their elders.At this moment, Heaven's Fate also floated up and sighed with emotion.""This guy ... If I were him, I would hide or take a risk to see if I can walk out of the Stargate. Waiting for you here ... He's just fated to die."Li Hao smiled but didn't say anything.Everyone had their own choices. Li daoheng knew that his chances of resurrecting were very high, so there wasn't much point in hiding. Once he was caught by Li Hao, he would be even more embarrassed.But today, he at least had a chance to compete with Li Hao in the sword.In fact, if it was just sword intent, the other party had won.Lin Hongyu was still a little suspicious. She was really scared of these guys."Why don't we go back and check on ninth master and Dao sword ... Even ... Even senior uncle Hong, I think, we should also ... Also check, at least to prevent the other party from seizing or invading the body."Li daoheng had been struck ten times by the primal Chaos lightning and still hadn't died. He could even fight Li Hao again. She truly believed that he could be resurrected."He's dead!"Li Hao shook his head.Who could say for sure?Lin Hongyu was about to say something, but Li Hao shook his head and said,""He really died! If he doesn't die this time, he's not worth my attention. He's a swordsman, and I've satisfied his desire to learn from each other. He even gave up the chaos sword intent he condensed. If li daoheng gave up his self, there's no difference between living and dying!"Lin Hongyu didn't quite understand. Li Hao laughed."Simply put, it's the root! Dao Foundation! The great Dao must have an origin. If you give up on the root of the Dao, the origin of the Dao, then there is no point in being a human. Just like you, your Dao origin is not life and death, not chaos ... It's the most primitive wish and desire in your heart. If you don't even have that ... You're not Lin Hongyu. Even if you're alive, you're dead. "The most primitive desire?Lin Hongyu started to think. What was my most primitive desire?Before she could speak, Li Hao said,"I don't know, and maybe you don't know either, but not knowing ... Is also a kind of happiness!" "Li daoheng knows, so he's in a lot of pain. Senior Empyrean pole also knows, but he lives very comfortably. Senior Empyrean pole's Dao origin is to not be disturbed by anything, eat and drink well, and live forever ... This kind of Dao origin and Dao root is actually very simple and very blissful."At the side, celestial pole wanted to roll his eyes again!Why are you criticizing me?What kind of person am I?"This brat, you're so arrogant now. If I were here ... I really want to beat you to death with a punch." What do you mean by "no disturbance"? you're beating around the bush and saying that I'm afraid of death?While Lin Hongyu was still thinking, Li Hao glanced at Anping residence and left her alone. He looked at the yard and said,""The ninth master is the only one left in the Li clan. Li daoheng let him off on purpose. Otherwise ... If he had really cut off all emotional ties, he would have killed the ninth master immediately!""Are you saying that he's soft-hearted?""He's not soft-hearted at all!"Lin Hongyu added.He was a villain. From Li Hao's appearance, did he think that the other party was soft-hearted?Li Hao shook his head again."I'm not saying that he's soft-hearted or that he's a good person. I'm just saying that he doesn't even believe in himself. How can he win?" He didn't believe that he could do anything after killing all the Li clan members ... Since that was the case ... What was the point of killing the Li clan members? It was unnecessary! If he didn't do it, if he did, then he would do it to the end! Why do you have to do it so hesitantly?""He was destined to fail from the very beginning!"As soon as he said this, celestial pole couldn't help but glance at him.At this moment, he could not help but think that this kid was truly vicious in his bones. If he were li daoheng...He might have already slaughtered Silver Moon a hundred thousand years ago!These few simple words actually made his hair stand on end.Li Hao said it so casually that Lin Hongyu didn't understand the deeper meaning behind it. On the other hand, Heaven's Fate, who was old and shrewd, still heard some things and felt a chill in his bones.This kid looked gentle and did things unhurriedly. He rarely spoke noisily, and in fact, he didn't say many harsh words. But a dog that bit didn't bark ... Li Hao was that kind of person!He had thought that Li Hao looked like Zhan Tiandi, but he knew that he was wrong.Zhan Tiandi was not ruthless in his bones.Li Hao was the exact opposite."Let's go!"  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao looked down and did not look at the Stargate above his head. He laughed while flying."I can't let everyone's efforts go to waste. I can use this opportunity to do something. For example ... See if I can revive my teacher and the others. In this way, it's worth it to owe them a favor!""Can I?"Lin Hongyu was stunned. Could it really work?"I couldn't in the past, but now ... I'll try! It was hard to find it in the past, but now, I can try to turn back time. Although it has been a long time, as long as I can find some traces, I might be able to find it!"Li Hao sighed and said,""They've been sleeping for too long. I hope they can all return! With senior ermao at the end of the past to help me suppress the river of time, I can give it a try. Otherwise, the world is fragile and it will be a bit troublesome!"Celestial pole rolled his eyes!è‰¹!You tricked second cat into going to the end of the river of time. Is this another plan?Was it just to get the other party to help you suppress time?If that was the case ... It could only be said that this grandson was really evil!Even Heaven's Fate couldn't tell how strong er Mao was. At least, from the last battle that year, er Mao had turned into an arrow and injured the celestial Emperor with one arrow. What kind of person was the celestial Emperor?He could kill an ordinary venerable sovereign with one punch!Er Mao could turn into an arrow and hurt him. Although Zhan Tiandi was the one leading, er Mao's own strength was definitely not weak.At this moment, it was indeed extraordinary to have it suppress the river.If Li Hao wanted to resurrect his teacher, he would need to turn back time and find some clues from the past ... With er Mao around, the difficulty would indeed be greatly reduced. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that he needed to stay away from him."I still have things to do," celestial pole said."I'll take my leave first. See you next time!""Senior, senior second cat is still here ..."The celestial pole had already disappeared, and a voice came,""Anyway, there's no hurry now. I'll go back and rest. I'm too seriously injured. See you next time!"In his heart, he was saying, never again!This Li Hao ... Really made people's hearts palpitate.Li Hao laughed, and Lin Hongyu couldn't help but laugh as well."This senior ... Is really interesting!"Interesting?Li Hao also laughed. It wasn't funny, but he was really afraid of death.A venerable sovereign actually had such a person, really ... You deserve to live long!To become a venerable sovereign could also be considered to have walked out of his own characteristics.

2504 Chapter 417
In the central continent.The people prayed.Li Hao had died and was facing death to live. Praying could bring Li Hao back to life. To the Silvermoon people, almost no one did not want Li Hao to be resurrected.With that person around, he felt full of confidence.What would Silver Moon do if Li Hao died?The lightning that filled the sky, the world that was expanding at a crazy rate, the demon beasts that were growing everywhere ... The Silvermoon people did not trust anyone else.There was no other reason. Before Li Hao's rise, heavenstar had been in feudal darkness for hundreds of years, and no one had been able to reverse the situation.Be it the nine divisions or the Silver Moon Martial Master, in the end, weren't they still the same?By the time Li Hao rose to power, the imperial family of the nine divisions, the three major organizations, the 99 provinces, the seven divine mountains, the ancient ruins, and the remnants of the neo martial artists ... Were all swept into the garbage dump!An invincible existence!Therefore, on this day, when they learned that Li Hao had died in battle, the hearts of the people trembled. Fortunately, they knew that he could be resurrected and felt much more at ease. However, at this moment, countless people were still worried that the resurrection would fail.They were also worried that the valiant soldiers would rebel after Li Hao's death.It was the same for all dynasties!If the Overlord's path collapsed, the people below would soon become chaotic.……Heavenly Star City.People were a little afraid.The governor's mansion.Hong Yitang, Qian Wuliang, and the others had gathered. At this moment, they were discussing how to combine the DAOs and the two universes in an attempt to ignite the stars of time and give Li Hao an opportunity to recover.Of course, Time and Stars seemed to have been completely destroyed by the primal Chaos lightning.Whether or not he could reignite it was also uncertain.Just as everyone was discussing how to quickly complete the prelude and resuscitate Li Hao, a figure appeared in the hall without a sound.In the beginning, no one cared.Only the Black Panther, who had been listless, suddenly turned its head. It had been lying on the side, but it suddenly looked over. The next moment, its dog eyes were full of shock and joy.Li Hao didn't choose to hide and observe anything.He didn't need to do that.Even though he had fallen this time, it was only because he was out of sight and out of mind. He had hoped to sleep for a period of time and give himself some peace. In the end, Lin Hongyu had resurrected him early. As for whether Qian Wuliang and the others would betray him or not, he didn't really care.Since he didn't care ... And he had the power to sweep the world, why hide it?There was no need for that."Woof!"The Black Panther's figure flickered and appeared in an instant. As soon as it moved, the people who were discussing turned their heads one after another. The next moment, they were all stunned. Some were frightened, some were happy, and some were in disbelief. At this moment, they began to wonder if this person was Li Hao. He was dead, so why was he here again?The recovery plan had not even begun!Qian Wuliang's expression also changed, and the next moment, he was overjoyed.""Lord Marquis has returned!"He quickly jumped up and hurried forward, overjoyed.""Lord Marquis has been resurrected!"At this moment, the others gradually regained their senses.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ They only heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Lin Hongyu chasing after them. They were all dazed. Hong Yitang was also confused. He sized Li Hao up. Is this ... Really Li Hao?Everyone had seen him being struck to death by lightning with their own eyes.Although he had the ability to bring the dead back to life, but ... No one was ready to resurrect him.Li Hao nodded slightly and smiled."It's only been a few hours. You don't seem to recognize me?"Director Zhao also quickly stepped forward. He looked at Li Hao, then at Lin Hongyu ... He even suspected that Lin Hongyu had found a substitute somewhere.He was using Li Hao to stabilize his position.However, when he saw Li Hao and sized him up ... Although he didn't have any aura, he instantly knew that this was Li Hao.In fact, Qian Wuliang was sure that it was Li Hao at once.As soon as it appeared, it brought him a sense of oppression, even a feeling of suffocation ... No one except Li Hao could give him such a feeling. When Li Hao looked at him, he even felt a little uneasy, feeling that a great disaster was imminent.He had never thought of betraying Lin Hongyu ... But he still had other thoughts. If he couldn't resurrect Li Hao, he would never submit to Lin Hongyu.He had hidden his thoughts in his heart ... And had never spoken of them. At this moment, the moment he saw Li Hao, he felt as if Li Hao had seen through him. He knew that perhaps he was just letting his imagination run wild.But the truth was, he was really panicking!Even though he had become the master of void Dao, a peak sixth level Dao integration cultivator, and a peak Heavenly King, he was still a little uneasy."Congratulations, Lord Marquis!"Director Zhao also spoke quickly, the uneasiness in his eyes dissipating. He was truly worried that Li Hao wouldn't be able to revive. If that happened, problems would arise sooner or later. The two Dao Masters were fighting, and the Silver Moon Martial Master was fighting with outsiders.The battle between the Silvermoon people and the neo martial artists.Without Li Hao's suppression, no one could do it.Now that Li Hao had been resurrected, he was much more at ease."Thank you, everyone!" Li Hao smiled again.He stepped forward without the slightest sense of urgency. He walked calmly towards the throne and said,"sit!"Everyone sat down.Each and every one of them was a little curious, and some of them were exhaling. Some of the gloominess from before disappeared in an instant, and the feeling of daggers being drawn also disappeared in an instant.Li Hao glanced around and saw that many people had disappeared.Almost none of the neo martial artists were present.It seemed that it was Lin Hongyu's decision. He said nothing, and of course, he did not want to explain it a second time. At this moment, the void froze. Li Hao reached out his hand, and the world seemed to crack.

2505 Chapter 417
In an instant, a Palace seemed to appear in front of everyone.The palace of the Li Dynasty!Li Hao's hand covered the sky as if he was looking at something from a mirror. His huge palm instantly landed on the palace of the Li Dynasty, and his voice resounded."Do not resist!"There were many people in the palace at the moment.Almost all the neo martial artists were here.Zhang an's expression changed drastically. Just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly heard a sound. His eyes moved slightly, and he gave up on resisting.The Dali King's expression changed instantly, and he punched out ... He couldn't even block it.The Queen also turned into a beam of moonlight and tried to escape.However, at this moment, everything in the world fell into his palm. Be it the fist or the moonlight, they all fell into his palm.Everyone's vision turned black, as if they had crossed space.Thousands of miles in an instant!In the blink of an eye, all the experts in the palace disappeared. The next moment, a group of people reappeared in the hall, all of them dumbfounded. Zhang an's eyes flickered as he looked at Li Hao and sighed."Congratulations!"Terrifying!At this moment, he even felt that Li Hao was a venerable sovereign!He ... Became a Saint Emperor?The king of Dali's fist was still in a punching state. The moment he saw Li Hao, he was stunned and couldn't believe it. "You ... Didn't you die?""He's alive again. "“……”The Dali King was speechless.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ F * ck!What was going on?Didn't they say that resurrection was very difficult?We've just flown to the Li Dynasty Palace, and you're alive?Are you still human?Did it mean that the bone-corroding Supreme Emperor and the others had died in vain? The Queen was rather tactful. Without saying a word, she rolled her eyes and looked around as if she was looking for an escape route. Now that she was suddenly caught by Li Hao and separated by thousands of mountains and rivers ... The Queen only felt that the guy in front of her was more terrifying than ever.He had no doubt that Li Hao was a fake.He was definitely a real person!If this guy was a fake, then he was too good at imitating.One didn't need aura or strength to judge a person. One only needed to look at the other party's eyes and listen to his tone. Some people didn't need aura to judge.The Dali King was stunned and looked around.""This is ... Heavenstar?""Heavenly Star City, governor's mansion."Li Hao said. He waved his hand, and more chairs appeared."All of you, sit down!"Zhang an didn't say much. He found an empty chair and sat down.As for the others, some of them still wanted to speak, but seeing him like this, they all sat down very quietly."Silver moon's internal crisis has been temporarily resolved. As for my resurrection ... There's no need to make a fuss about it. After all, I've more or less mastered the power of time, so I won't die easily!""The Silvermoon world is currently in the process of upgrading, and everyone has benefited. Whether it's the new martial artists or the Silvermoon, they'll all benefit, and not just one person will benefit!"There's no need to make a fuss about resurrection?What a joke!"When you resurrected before, you died and resurrected instantly. But this time, you were struck by the primal Chaos lightning and turned into dust. Time and Stars are all gone! This could also be resurrected?This was not the key!"The key is that you are 100% not borrowing the power of the future. You actually grabbed these people from the Dali dynasty thousands of miles away and brought them here. The Dali King is a Heavenly King, but a punch from him did not even cause a wave!What do you call this?It was hard to say for the others, but the king of Dali was more straightforward. "You've advanced again?""Sort of," Li Hao smiled."What do you mean by considered?""You ..." The Dali King asked."You actually captured us from so far away. Have you already proven your Dao and become an Emperor?""Just a little bit more,"Just a little bit more?Why do you think that even a half-step Emperor isn't as powerful as you? you call this "lacking"?Although the king of Dali wanted to ask more, he was still a little speechless when he saw everyone staring at him. He stopped asking and only said,""Then you've captured enough of them, why did you capture this King?"I'm not your subject!"It's convenient,"Li Hao laughed."You're the master. If I didn't bring you here, you would have thought that everyone left without saying goodbye."艹!What did he say?Li Hao stopped teasing him and said,""Since everyone mistakenly thinks that I'm dead and need to be resurrected, I can't waste everyone's good intentions. I want to resurrect some people."Everyone's heart froze.The Silver Moon martial masters were all excited. Yuan Shuo and the others?Ever since the battle at the boundless city, Northern fist's eyes had been filled with fierceness, far from the harmonious look he had in the past. At this moment, the fierceness in his eyes suddenly disappeared for a moment,""Resurrect who?""Just as you thought," Li Hao looked at him."Can I?" bei Quan's eyes instantly lit up."I'm not sure,"Bei Quan was slightly dejected, but very quickly, his enthusiasm was reignited.""You can do it!"He definitely could!If you could revive after being struck to death by Primal Chaos tribulation lightning, so could they!At this moment, the people from Hong Yitang also focused their attention.Resurrect Yuan Shuo and the others?Really?To be honest, ever since those people had died in battle, the Silver Moon Martial Master seemed to have lost his vitality. He did things in silence, and there was very little joy and laughter.There were no more curses, such as the southern style.Those who coughed stopped, like hou Xiaochen.There were no more braggers, such as Yuan Shuo.The cold-faced ones were also gone, such as Jin gun, who everyone regarded as a benchmark for combat strength.No one said anything else. Thirty-six heroes, thirty-five crippled.No one said that their Minister was omnipotent.In the end, hou Xiaochen couldn't marry Yu Luosha, leaving him with endless regrets.Yao si also left, and no one said anything else. When he was around, the Silver Moon Martial Master wasn't even born yet ...

All of this caused the atmosphere in the upper echelons of heavenstar to change.But today, when Li Hao said that he would try to resurrect them, all the Silver Moon martial masters became excited.Qian Wuliang and the others also let out a sigh of relief.In fact, some of them had already regretted it.What was there to regret?He regretted that he should have saved those people that day, especially Yuan Shuo ... Although it was very, very difficult, and almost impossible.However, ever since Yuan Shuo's death, following Li Hao ... Had been rather frightening.The Li Hao of the past was not as cold, indifferent, and callous as he was now.Even if his smile was fake ... There was some sincerity in it. The smile now seemed to be purely controlled by expression. One could not feel any warmth at all, only endless coldness.At that time, Li Hao would laugh and joke with Nan Quan, smile and wink at Yu Luosha, provoke hou Xiaochen from time to time, act childishly in front of Yuan Shuo, and curse at Yao si ...At that time, he was a true young man.But now ... He was still him, but also not him.If Qian Wuliang had known that this day would come, he would have risked his life to get one of them back. If he couldn't get Yuan Shuo back, he could still save the southern Fist.Nan Quan was here. That guy was thick-skinned, and he was familiar with Li Hao. He was not afraid of anything. Even if Yuan Shuo died, Nan Quan could still withstand Li Hao's cold face. The others were not as good.Hong Yitang could do it, but most importantly, he was sometimes even quieter than Li Hao. It was better not to count on him.At this moment, everyone was looking at Li Hao.Li Hao said,"there are a few difficulties in resurrecting them. First, the most powerful of their Natal stars must have been shattered. We need to make sure if there are any weak ones left.""Second, there are too many stars. There are countless stars in the entire great Dao universe, billions of them. There are too many that haven't been opened. How to lock onto their stars ... This is the key!""Third, even if we find some stars ... Which belong to them, can we revive people on the stars that have not been opened? I've never tried it before. The resurrection of gods can only be done when the stars are opened. This is simple!""The fourth ..."Li Hao paused and looked at everyone."We must use the power of time this time. It's very likely that the chaotic lightning will appear again ... If the lightning appears, and I insist on reviving it, the two masters of the great Dao might be struck to death."Qian Wuliang looked determined."Of course, we need to resurrect him. If he is killed by the lightning ... There will be a chance for him to resurrect again in the future!"“……”Everyone looked at him. Are you serious?Li Hao laughed,"Wuliang is really an amazing person!."Was this a compliment or a mockery?Qian Wuliang couldn't make a decision right away. "But I'm kind enough. Whatever." He thought.Li Hao smiled."Then let's do it this way. It's fine as long as Wuliang has no objections. If the primal Chaos lightning is really triggered, Wuliang will use the void Dao universe to seal the Silver Moon and hold on for a while ..."Qian Wuliang cursed under his breath,"me again?I knew it!If I had known, I wouldn't have said anything. It was really ...If I really encountered that lightning, wouldn't I be struck to death by it?Li Hao continued."In addition, if I can't find it in the real Dao universe, I'll go to the void Dao universe to find it. But previously, many void Dao stars were shattered ... I might not be able to find it. The hope is not big. Thus, the key is still the real Dao universe ..."After saying a few words, he looked at Lin Hongyu.""Continue to preside over the prayers of the people and get everyone to activate their Dao meridians. Once the Dao meridians are activated, I can remove a portion of them. Through the connection, I can also classify the stars that have not been activated. The rest ... Should be the stars left behind by the dead."Li Hao continued,"of course, there will definitely be a lot left. It will be difficult to find them. It may take a long time to do this. In short, please work hard for a while.""Duty-bound!"Everyone chimed in.Seeing that it had nothing to do with him, the king of Dali was about to leave when Li Hao suddenly looked at him.""The king of Dali!""What ... What are you doing here?"He almost blurted out a sentence to show that he was too lowly, but he immediately followed up with,"I'm the king of Dali.""I need your help this time," Li Hao smiled."What?"The king of Dali was puzzled. What did it have to do with him?"You have the most vigorous qi and blood. Even my qi and blood are not as strong as yours ... Since you're a beginner martial artist, lend me some of your qi and blood to reconstruct your body!""If they can really be resurrected," Li Hao explained,"they'll have a strong foundation. Your vitality ... You've also swallowed the skeleton of a top-notch beginner martial artist. You just need to lend me some of your vitality.""How much do you want?" the king of Dali was a little speechless."All of them."“……”艹! The king of Dali was instantly on guard. Why? do you want to kill me?"All of them?""All of them!" Li Hao nodded."You want to kill me?""No."Li Hao shook his head and said,"to save you!" Although you didn't summon the future and only summoned the power of celestial ruler BA or Supreme Emperor tie, you were still affected by some karma. Now that you've been reborn, since you don't have a future, you might be able to avoid this karma. ""Then ... Wouldn't I be crippled?"The king of Dali was on high alert. Why do I feel that you are lying to me?I helped you once before, but you didn't even give me any benefits.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao shook his head,"why would I be crippled?" It's also to help you sort out your body. You eat all sorts of things, and your qi and blood are actually very mixed! It's not a good thing for you to improve too quickly!"

Are you saying that I'm faster than you?The king of Dali didn't think it was credible, but he also felt that it was somewhat credible."Then how am I supposed to recover my vitality when it's gone?""Simple!"Li Hao laughed."I'm not trying to harm you. I'm actually trying to make it up to you. I asked you for help before. This time, I'm paying off my debt!" "I'll use the river of time to cleanse you. A little of your lifespan will be consumed and new blood and Qi will be born. You have no future, so you'll become your own future ..."Would this work?The king of Dali looked at Li Hao warily.""Are there any disadvantages?""If I tell you, I'll consume some of my lifespan.""How much is a little?""I don't know. Let's see when you can recover completely. Ten years means that you'll spend ten years, and a hundred years means that you'll spend a hundred years."The Dali King frowned and asked again,"so after I recover, it'll be my pure qi and blood power?" All the disadvantages from before are gone?"This didn't seem too bad. As for his lifespan, he was still young. At this stage, it should not be difficult for him to live for 100000 years, right?So what if it took a hundred years?It seemed ... Feasible!"The previous flaws will naturally not remain. In the face of time, those problems are no longer problems."The Dali King felt relieved and nodded. Just as he was about to agree, his expression suddenly changed."No, the disadvantage from before is gone. Then, other than lifespan, are there any other problems?"Li Hao thought for a while and nodded.""We might be struck by Primal Chaos lightning."  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "I ..."The Dali King wanted to curse!Go to hell!Li Hao said seriously,"it's for your own good. After all, you've been affected by time. It's not now that you'll be struck by lightning, but in the future. I've already calculated the time for you to be struck by lightning. It'll be on the day the Stargate opens! I won't cut you if you don't open the Stargate! As long as you can withstand it that day, there will be no obstacles on your way!"Is that true?He quickly thought about it, but he felt that he couldn't outwit this guy, which gave him a headache.Was it real or fake?"No other questions?""No more!"The king of Dali was in a dilemma. He was not afraid of gambling, but the problem was that ... He did not seem to get much out of it. Li Hao might have put it nicely, but most of the time, he was just making empty promises!This time, Li Hao said seriously,""You're now at the Heavenly King stage, and it's very difficult for you to advance any further. However, your blood Qi is pure, and with the promotion of the world, you can take this opportunity to successfully advance ... You'll definitely be able to step into the peak Heavenly King stage or even the half-step sovereign stage! Once the Stargate is opened, it'll support you again and help you survive the crisis. You'll be at least a half-step sovereign, a genuine half-step sovereign. If you're lucky ... You might even have a chance to become a sovereign!"Go to hell! The king of Dali didn't believe it, but a half-step sovereign ... There was hope, right?He hesitated for a while before nodding."Alright, sure. I'll borrow your vitality force ... But don't try to fool me!"He didn't know how to threaten her.If he was fooled, what could he do to him?"That won't happen!" Li Hao smiled.He then looked at the Queen. The Queen instantly felt that something was wrong and her eyes were full of vigilance. Li Hao, on the other hand, smiled gently."Queen ... Do you have a real name?""Wu!"The Queen didn't say anything.Li Hao smiled. He didn't mind."Previously, when I borrowed your Silver moon's power to transform into heaven's will, I said that I would definitely repay you. This time, I'll give you an opportunity!""No need, I don't need it!" The Queen said instantly."No, I, Li Hao, will definitely return the favor!"Li Hao's expression was undoubted as he said,""This is also an opportunity! You're actually the same as the king of Dali. You've devoured too much external power, and the power is mixed. The power of the moon goddess is actually a little mixed ...""What do you mean, Marquis li?" the Queen asked solemnly."You have quite a bit of power of belief in your body. The power of belief is actually very messy. It might even be formed by hundreds of thousands, millions, or even more people. Without the baptism of the chaos great Dao, it's actually very messy!""Your problem is actually easy to solve," Li Hao continued."You don't even need time to wash away the impurities. You just need to swim in the river of chaos and wash away the impurities!"Li Hao smiled."This time, I'll give you the opportunity to travel in the river of chaos under senior uncle Hong's control. This opportunity is usually not given to outsiders!""Then what do I need to pay?" the Queen asked."Like I said, it's to repay the favor I owe you."Really?You don't need me to do anything?The Queen thought for a while and felt that if that was the case ... She could give it a try, but to be honest, Li Hao was too difficult to be at ease.She felt that it was more reliable for the Dali King to give up his vitality.If he didn't put in any effort ... He would be unreliable.The Queen quickly said,"that won't do. This King was only borrowing power previously. It's nothing. The river of chaos is very important ... This King doesn't want to owe anyone a favor. Tell me something. If this King can do it, I can help you solve it!""The Queen is too polite!"Li Hao laughed and sighed,"in that case, it's hard to refuse such kindness!" After I died ... I mean before, the Silver Moon did not have heaven's will. The Queen devoured the power of the Silver Moon, and as the only God, she was born to carry on the will of heaven and earth. If nothing unexpected happens, the Queen has temporarily replaced the position of heaven's will. "The Queen was shocked!"Of course, it doesn't matter," Li Hao added.Li Hao chuckled."What the Queen has to do is simple. After they're resurrected, gather the power of the Silver Moon and help me cast my bones and Foundation!" "After I die, the Heaven's Will that is scattered and incomplete ... Take some of it out. You're absorbing too much of it! I'll give some to the resurrected ones. It just so happens that the Silver Moon world is about to level up, so they'll absorb some to gain the benefits of leveling up. "

The Queen was silent for a moment, then nodded without saying anything.Li Hao ... Knew everything.He just didn't say it.Yes, ever since Li Hao was no longer heaven's will, she had devoured a large amount of the Silver Moon's power and become the only God in the world. Now that there was no heaven's will, she was.Now, Li Hao wanted her to spit out a part of it ... Could she refuse?It can 't!This guy had a clear mind.,m If he dared to reject, he would have to be careful. Furthermore, the Silver Moon world was about to level up. If he rejected it now, he might not even get the benefits of leveling up."I have no objections!"Li Hao nodded and smiled, the Queen knows the big picture! As for the matter of you killing hundreds of thousands of Silvermoon citizens ..."The Queen's expression changed!Her believers were all from the divine Kingdom, so how did the divine Kingdom's believers ... Become residents of the Silver Moon?Of course, it was also fine to put it this way.But in fact, it was only good for Li Hao. These fanatical believers were actually a very serious drawback. The Queen had solved it in one go ... Almost all the fanatical believers in the divine Kingdom were dead!This would be of great help to heavenstar in controlling the world.But now ..."It's complicated," Li Hao said."I don't want to pursue the matter. However, it's a sin to kill so many ordinary humans without any restraint! God nation has already been taken over by heavenstar. If we don't deal with it, it will also chill the hearts of the people! Let's pay the price of God-breaking! There are no more gods in this world, and the day my teacher and the others resurrect will be the day I lose my God!"Li Hao looked at her."I'll burn all the faith in your body. I'll reflect the world and make you a peerless God. No problem, right?"The Queen's expression changed slightly. After a while, she nodded."Sure!"The problem wasn't too big, but there was a bad thing. It would be difficult to gather faith in the future!"It's for your own good. Gods have no future!"Li Hao smiled."The Queen will definitely have a greater future. It's better to absorb less power of belief. It's a token of my appreciation."Go to hell!The Queen didn't say anything, but she cursed in her heart.As for the others, they didn't say a word. They were secretly speechless. How ruthless.The moment he came out, he took care of the two kings.More importantly, he kept saying that it was for their own good ... It sounded rather reasonable, but who knew if he was really doing it for their own good?In this way, the blood was the blood of the Heavenly King, and the bones were the bones of the heaven and earth. If these people were really resurrected, they would have a higher Foundation.Li Hao easily solved most of the problem.Finally, he added: "the truth Dao and The Phantom Dao are separated into two DAOs. They must be combined into one. Only when combined into one will they be complete!"Hearing this, Qian Wuliang's expression changed.However, he quickly suppressed it.Li Hao continued,"Qian Wuliang's palm of the virtual Dao is also an opportunity. Senior uncle Hong's palm of the truth Dao is also an opportunity." It's not appropriate to let anyone go. "Li Hao glanced at the two of them."I've been thinking. I've taken away the heart of the great Dao, time and star. The opportunity to combine the two DAOs is gone again ... There are drawbacks to true combination!"He sighed with emotion."It just so happens that Silver Moon is about to advance! Phantom path and real path had two universes with the center. What was the center, and what was it? Let's use the Silvermoon world as our core!"What did that mean?Everyone's heart stirred. Li Hao explained,""On the day the Silvermoon world advanced, the two of you descended upon the great Dao universe with the Silvermoon as the heart of the great Dao, which is also the Dao surrounding Silvermoon! Each of them controls a realm, and through the Silver Moon connection, they connect the truth path and Phantom path through this point!"Zhang an couldn't help but ask,""In this case, is the great Dao universe still considered as one?""It counts!"Li Hao nodded."Not only that, but there's also another benefit. The two of you control two DAOs, and the people cultivate all DAOs. Whether it's reality Dao or Phantom Dao, they're all in the same universe. Phantom Dao is integrated, and reality Dao is also integrated ... It depends on the hearts of the people, the benefits of promotion, and the direction of the people!"Li Hao smiled,'the people favor the truth, and the truth is stronger in the universe! The people were inclined to The Phantom Dao universe, Phantom Dao was strong! People abandoned Phantom path, Phantom path was destroyed, while truth path prospered! The people abandon the truth path, the truth path will be destroyed, and The Phantom path will prosper!""You two, do you understand what I mean?"Qian Wuliang's face turned pale, and he seemed to be on the verge of collapse. He said helplessly,"Lord Marquis ... Phantom path is now focused on the spiritual path, I ..."In this world, everyone was cultivating the path of reality, how many of them cultivated the path of Phantom?è‰¹!In this case, am I not destined to be someone's wedding dress?This was too ruthless!Li Hao, however, shook his head and said seriously,""Wrong! Truth Dao was definitely not as strong as Phantom Dao! However, you need to work hard and promote it. How do you promote it? Divine text, power, these were the key! "In the past, the people did not have intelligence and could only cultivate the simple practical Dao. But now, everyone has barely gained intelligence. This is actually an opportunity for you!""The more I gain wisdom, the more I understand that the truth is crude and focuses on close combat! Only Phantom path has Dao cultivation gods!"He looked at Qian Wuliang and said,"promote The Phantom path and spread it. The people will be strong, and you will be strong!" If the people are weak, you are weak! The more difficult it is, the greater the harvest. If you can successfully turn Phantom path into the mainstream of the world, senior uncle Hong can only carry your shoes!"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Hong Yitang smiled and nodded," Phantom path has huge potential, this is beyond doubt. "Qian Wuliang felt helpless, for it was easier said than done.Everyone only knew the cultivation method of the truth path, while The Phantom path ... Was ethereal.Also, cultivating Shi was not easy.

2509 Chapter 417
However, Li Hao was right about one thing. The more powerful a person was, the more they liked to study Phantom path.One strong person could fight against tens of thousands of weak people.To rope in a group of experts to cultivate Phantom path, for example, one person like BA Dao could support many.However, he also knew that this was Li Hao's favoritism for Hong Yitang ... He couldn't say that Li Hao was wrong. If he was really capable, he actually had a chance to turn the tables!After all, he was slightly inferior to Hong Yitang.Li Hao was already kind enough to give them this opportunity!If it was someone else ... If you let me out, I'll let you die of lightning!"The Marquis said that the people are strong, and we are strong ... Then ..." Qian Wuliang suddenly said.Li Hao seemed to know what he was going to say. He nodded.""Treat the people well. After the Silver Moon world is upgraded and the Stargate is opened, I may have to give birth to the Silver Moon. You and martial uncle Hong may be the human King and human Emperor of the Silver Moon! In cultivation, one could control the hearts of the people and not be emotionless. In fact, there were many benefits. One could worry about the People's anxiety and worry about them. As time passed, one would not care about one's heart. What was the harm in becoming a saint? It doesn't matter if you're hypocritical or sincere, but if you're so hypocritical that everyone praises you for doing good, who would care if you're sincere or not?"Qian Wuliang was speechless.In other words, I have to be a good person from now on?A good person through and through?Was this what he meant?Work for the people?Was this what he meant?After that, if the people were strong, if the people trusted him, if the people cultivated The Phantom path, he would be invincible?It seemed simple, but ... It felt as difficult as ascending to the heavens!I'm an ambitious person!Why ... Did it end up like this?He suddenly felt that controlling the void Dao universe was not necessarily a good thing.The foundation of reality Dao was here, but Phantom Dao did not have any Foundation and completely needed him to explore!At this moment, everyone was also speechless.He also felt that Qian Wuliang was quite miserable. Even though it sounded like he had a lot of opportunities, for these Silver Moon martial masters ... They would lose their freedom.He's not doing as he pleases anymore? Then forget it! In fact, it was good for Qian Wuliang to master Phantom path."Many thanks for Lord Marquis's support!"At this moment, Qian Wuliang was half worried and half happy, but he still thanked her with a complicated expression.At least, I'm still the master of the void Dao universe.It's just that there are many more burdens!Li Hao laughed."No need to thank me. Whether you're strong or weak, it's all up to you!" The two universes will use the Silver Moon as the intersection point, which will make the Silver Moon even more powerful!"Zhang an asked again,""Doesn't that mean we have to pay Silver Moon?" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Li Hao shook his head and said,"that's not necessary." In the future, when the Dao universe expands, it can be expanded at any time. For now, leaving the Silver Moon's territory is not necessarily a good thing!""Alright!" He then looked at Zhang an."The Stargate meeting will begin!"He knew what Zhang an was thinking, so he gave him a calming pill and said,""The premise is that we still have a chance to get out if we open the Stargate. If the Crimson Moon universe Supreme Emperor blocks the gate, or if the primal Chaos lightning tribulation strikes us without limit ... We don't have to think too much."Alright!It was also this logic.At this point, a sword intent appeared in Li Hao's hand. He threw it at the ninth Division commander."This is the sword intent I left behind after li daoheng was hacked to death. After all, he is your elder brother, and you are the only descendant of the Li family. Ninth master, please take it!"The ninth master's expression was complicated. He took the sword intent and his heart froze. So strong!Looking around, Li Hao looked at Dao Jian, who hardly spoke, and said,""Dao sword, don't have too much of a burden. You are one of the most talented people in this era. Li daoheng using you is your chance, otherwise, it will be very difficult for you to catch up with others! If fourth Minister Yao can be resurrected this time, he probably hopes to see your progress. There's a small courtyard near the Stargate. You can go there and gain some insight.
