On the other hand, Li Hao had used up too much of his energy and might be worn out to death."Interesting!"Li Hao suddenly laughed. The next moment, divine runes appeared and transformed into a domain. The power of this thing came from the dark Demon Ridge. He had a thought that perhaps he needed to isolate it!As long as he could isolate it and prevent it from receiving energy, he would be able to kill the opponent.Otherwise ... This thing would never die.No wonder the second stage venerable sovereign called it an undead creature. Perhaps he had tried to kill it and found out that even if he killed it, it was undead and could recover quickly.Domain!Divine rune territory!In fact, Li Hao hadn't used it for a long time. Ever since he mastered the river of time and River of Life and death, this domain wasn't as useful to Li Hao anymore. In the past, it could block heaven's will, but later, heaven's will became a Black Panther. What was the use of blocking the Black Panther?However, when he used it again today, it had its uses.Divine runes appeared one after another, creating a massive domain.The power of darkness in the surroundings was isolated.Although the dark power was still seeping in, and was much more powerful than Li Hao's domain, it was enough to block most of the dark power.Li Hao continued to fight with the Barbarian. This time, Li Hao discovered that his opponent's strength had weakened. The dark energy in his body was also being consumed rapidly."Domain ..."As Li Hao fought, he wondered if the other experts had domains.He really didn't know.A domain was something unique to him. It was something that Yuan Shuo had taught him. Back then, he had used it to invade the entire Silvermoon world. However, he had given up on it after he had lost interest in doing so.Divine text, force, and the power of a great Dao were all fused together to form a domain that could isolate heaven's will. This was actually a very special thing.The inner world of a neo martial human King was actually the peak of a domain.It formed its own inner world!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The neo martial human King was considered the master of the great Dao and the master of the world, but he could only be considered half a master. However, his own inner world was a real master of the world.The fact that neo martial human Kings could enter the seventh stage and were about to enter the eighth stage might be related to their inner world.The yin-yang world might only be a part of it.……He had used his territory to isolate the dark energy of the dark Demon Ridge.The dark treacherous centipede was clearly on the decline. Li Hao was a peak stage two venerable Emperor of life and death after all, and he had mastered many other great DAOs and powerful sword techniques.At this point, the yin Chi had no more strength to resist.Li Hao kept attacking. He tried to attack with different DAOs, and even condensed a light sword intent that was not too strong ... In the end, it did not seem to have a strong targeted destructive power as he had imagined. The dark power was extremely high in quality and seemed to be immune to the light sword intent.In the end, Li Hao discovered that the Dark Sword intent was more lethal.The power of darkness that came from the same source actually had a normal destructive power.This happened three times. After a while of fighting, Li Hao shattered his opponent's body with his sword. The body shattered, revealing a Dark crystal-like object. There was also dark power seeping out of the object, which was connected to the dark power outside.This should be the crystallization of his Taoist connotation.It contained some of the power of the hidden Dao of the dark Demon Ridge.With just a glance, Li Hao sighed with emotion."Good stuff!"Inside the crystal, the Taoist connotation was flowing, as if he could see the darkness. This thing was the remnant of a rank eight venerable sovereign's great Dao. Even if it was very little, it was not ordinary.The moment Li Hao killed the dark centipede, black shadows suddenly appeared around him.Li Hao gasped!As expected, it was troublesome.Many more dark humongous birds appeared in the surroundings. A few of them ... Felt as if they were not weaker than the heavenly River Thearch. He was a middle-stage venerable sovereign.Killing one had attracted so many.Li Hao didn't dare to delay. He hurriedly dissipated his domain, and the word "dark" appeared again, turning into a dark domain that enveloped him. The power of darkness of the same element permeated the surroundings.The dark Mantis scouted around, and one of the stronger ones even landed next to Li Hao.Those empty eyes seemed to be looking at Li Hao.He seemed to be judging something.After a while, the yin Chi disappeared. Li Hao let out a sigh of relief.This place was so dangerous.If it wasn't for his domain, he would be in trouble this time. More importantly, without his domain, he might not even be able to kill the dark Yin Chi. It would be very disadvantageous to fight with these undead creatures."Fortunately!"Li Hao rejoiced inwardly. The next moment, he was overjoyed.This dark Dao accumulation crystal was a good thing. He had already built 238 bridges of life and death. It should be no problem for him to build a few bridges with this thing, right?The third level venerable sovereign was right in front of him.The next moment, Li Hao looked into the distance. He seemed to be able to see further than before. The Dark Crystal in his hand seemed to have allowed him to see further. He even saw a venerable sovereign heading in his direction thousands of meters away.He looked down at The Dark Crystal, and his heart stirred.This thing ... Seemed to be able to help him see further.At the very least, he could sense a wider range in this place. Before, Li Hao could only see a thousand meters away, but now, he seemed to be able to see three to five thousand meters away.The venerable sovereign was at least 3000 meters away from him.

To venerable sovereigns, it was not far, but just within reach.However, in the dark Demon Ridge, at such a short distance, as long as you didn't make a sound, the other party wouldn't be able to see you or sense your aura."The Dark Crystal and the circulation of Taoist connotation ... The same Taoist connotation can help me see further."Li Hao had wanted to absorb it, but now he hesitated.Should I stay?The next moment, he had another thought."This is only a Grade 2 Yin Chi, it can see three to five thousand meters, what if it's a Grade 3 one? Perhaps even further! I'll absorb it first and enter the 3rd rank. Then, I'll think of a way to kill a 3rd rank Yin Chi. Isn't that better?"As for the rank three venerable sovereign not far away, he could put him aside for now.Right now, someone might be watching him. It was fine to kill Yin Chi, but it was hard to say if he would kill a third level venerable sovereign rashly. He might as well enter the third level and deal with the other party.Thinking of this, Li Hao disappeared again.……After he had disappeared for a while.A venerable sovereign appeared, and it was also the last venerable sovereign there. The remaining three had entered the dark Shrine, and only this third rank venerable sovereign had not been able to find the location of the dark Shrine.Soon, the other party arrived at the place where Li Hao had fought.After sensing it, he frowned slightly.A battle should have just erupted here, but it didn't seem to be the energy fluctuations of his great dark world. Could it be ... That Haoyue?"That guy is still alive?"The venerable sovereign was surprised. There were many undead creatures here, and they were all very powerful.He couldn't kill him, and he couldn't escape.These few days, he had been very uncomfortable and had carefully avoided it.This Haoyue was actually still alive, which was a bit unexpected.He looked around. As a third level venerable sovereign, he could see quite far, about two thousand meters away. However, he did not see anyone around him. Instead, he saw a dark Chi.Frowning slightly, he quickly retreated. It was better for him to look for mi han.It had been five or six days since he entered this place. They might have reached The Dark Divine Palace long ago, or even entered it. However, he was entangled by these Yin swirls and lost his way.……Not long after he left.Li Hao reappeared in an instant. He looked in the direction that the other party had left in and fell into deep thought. Soon, his dark domain enveloped him and he sat down cross-legged again. He was not in a hurry.His main goal was to advance.'I'll advance first, kill another dark centipede, seize the dark Dao accumulation crystal, and see further. Then ... If I encounter these guys from the dark great world again, I'll be able to kill them. 'This time, Li Hao didn't need to purify the dark Dao accumulation crystal.In essence, the energy was extremely pure.The river of life and death devoured the power of darkness. Li Hao sensed for a while and frowned. He couldn't absorb too much. His River of Life and death was already filled with darkness-type energy.It was better to balance the power of great DAOs.Fortunately, the power of life and death had also gained some benefits from killing a venerable sovereign. There was no situation where the power of darkness invaded life and death and surpassed life and death. Otherwise, he would have become a darkness-type venerable sovereign."After I enter the 3rd rank ... It's best to absorb less dark energy!" Li Hao thought to himself that it wasn't a good thing to be too biased.This time, he began to absorb the energy again.The energy with high purity was much stronger than that of the stage two venerable sovereign. Li Hao didn't need to purify it. The river circulated, and soon, the 239th bridge was built. ……At the same time.In the river, second cat opened his eyes and wriggled his huge butt uncomfortably.The dark energy was too dense.Li Hao had obtained a lot of darkness-type energy from this place.There was even a special wave of Taoist connotation.After sensing for a while, it suddenly opened its mouth and swallowed a strand of Taoist connotation in the river. Li Hao's voice was heard,"Senior second cat, what are you doing?"The Taoist connotation was the comprehension of the great Dao of experts.Li Hao was going to try to comprehend it.In the end, it was swallowed by second cat.Second cat had never been like this before.Could it be that he was hungry?Second cat shook its huge butt."Eighth-grade dark power. Dark element comprehension ... Dark element is easy to lose one's mind. It's best that you don't try to comprehend it. Even if you want to, you have to improve your comprehension of the light element first ... Only when the two extremes are balanced can you reap greater benefits. Otherwise, if you go crazy, who will cultivate time?"“……”It made so much sense!But why ... Do I feel that you're just hungry?Li Hao was speechless.Of course, if second cat ate it, so be it. Come to think of it, you're good at saying that I'm good. If you eat it yourself, it's also a kind of enlightenment, right?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Wasn't he afraid that he would go crazy?Li Hao asked while building the 240 bridges,""Senior Buttface, this is your first time seeing an eighth level venerable sovereign, right?"Second cat shook its butt and ignored him."Zhan Tiandi, was he a level six venerable sovereign back then?" Li Hao asked with a smile.Back then, the big villain of neo martial, the heavenly Emperor, should have been at level six, right?After the human King killed him, it took a few years for him to step into the seventh level.This meant that when the human King killed him, the other party was not a seventh-rank, although neo martial was already a great world back then.Zhan Tiandi should be at the same level as the heavenly Emperor, right?"Yes, sixth rank ...""Something like that ... I guess so," second cat mumbled.In the next moment, he muttered in an almost inaudible manner,""In terms of energy, I guess?"

In fact, it didn't know how strong a teacher was. In terms of energy, it was probably just that.However, the teacher seemed to know everything. Perhaps, his comprehension of Dao was more than that?It had just swallowed some of the eighth-grade comprehensions, but it didn't feel anything special after eating some. It was better to teach and teach.Li Hao didn't ask further.At this moment, he was building 240 bridges.In the river of life and death, the 240th bridge was rapidly forming.……Back to the Dragon Temple.The Supreme Emperor frowned as he watched Li Hao's light spot grow stronger rapidly.Third rank?He had not guessed wrong. This fellow had been hiding his strength all this while. In reality, he had long been a third stage venerable sovereign, right? It was possible that he had hidden his strength under the eyes of a sixth stage venerable sovereign like him ... He did have some ability."Tier 3 ... No wonder he's so confident!"He snorted. No wonder he was so arrogant.However, rank three was only a low level venerable sovereign.A first-stage venerable sovereign ... Give him time. If 100000 years wasn't enough, then 200000 years. Even if he endured, he would still be able to reach the third stage. A third-stage venerable sovereign like the returning Dragon sovereign was nothing to be afraid of."If he's a rank 3 ... Then he might really not be the Silver Moon King!"He felt a bit regretful. It had only been a year since the Silver Moon King had opened the Stargate.In a world like silver Moon, it was already good enough to be able to produce a first stage venerable sovereign. Therefore, no matter how fast the Silver Moon King's progress was, he should not be able to reach the third stage. It would be difficult to even reach the second stage.So, he might have guessed wrong.At this moment, Hui long Emperor was filled with regret.What a pity!I really hoped that this guy was the Silver Moon King, and it would be best if he had a Dao universe. That would be my greatest opportunity, but now it's gone!How hateful!Where was the Silver Moon King?Was he in the Grand celestial world?He frowned. Could it be that the other party had not come to the tianfang world at all?If that was the case, finding the other party would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.……At this moment, stars were twinkling in the long river, and the waves were surging.The power of life and death continued to rise.At the center of the river, the life and death Star was shining brightly. The power of life and death was spreading across the river.From stage two to stage three, there was no Primal Chaos lightning tribulation.He had descended before because Li Hao had once again walked the path of life and death, the reincarnation of life and death. This time, it was just an ordinary advancement. There was no transformation, nor did he walk the reincarnation path. It was much quieter. Li Hao, on the other hand, had a sad look in his eyes.Tier 3!As expected, after forming 240 bridges of life and death, it was the third step.That 360 lines was probably only at the peak of rank three.If he wanted to step into Tier 4 ... He would probably have to start with other great DAOs."I'm rank three now ..."He suddenly grinned. Back then, Heaven's Fate's original body seemed to have been rank two. After more than 50 years of chaos, he wondered if he was rank three now.What if I'm at the same level as the Heaven's Fate?That would be interesting!This person had been thinking of giving him a punch when his main body met him.'If I really meet him next time ... Why don't I give him a punch?'"The third rank is so difficult!"Li Hao sighed with emotion again. In order to enter level three, he had killed three venerable sovereigns here, five in the Tianhe zone, one in the Coiling Dragon Well, and two just after leaving the Silver Moon ...There were 11 venerable sovereigns. Apart from the Chaos Beast, he had killed 10 venerable sovereigns, one of whom was at the fourth rank. He had only reached the third rank.The kind that had just entered Tier 3!How many would he have to kill to reach Tier 4?There were many venerable sovereigns in the Outlander world. Would killing them all be enough for him to reach Level Seven?"Why do I have such a thought?"Li Hao mumbled."Killing people is not a good thing. I'm a good person, so I can't kill people randomly. I can't learn from the neo martial warrior king. I must have been disturbed by him."What a terrifying fellow!It's actually interfering with me even across time and space!……The chaosverse.A young man with a blade was wandering around like a hooligan.Suddenly, he rubbed his nose.He looked in a certain direction and raised his eyebrows slightly. Is there a grandson who is talking about me?From the looks of it, it might have something to do with me.Should he go and kill the other party with one strike?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Forget it, there have been a lot of things going on recently. I won't argue with the guy who mumbled about me. Anyway, it's definitely not a good thing."That side ... The Crimson Moon world?" he asked.The young man muttered to himself for a while before looking in a certain direction. Who knew?If it's the Crimson Moon, stay away for the time being. I'll go find another great world and start a war.

Chapter 2673 The Dark Shrine (1)
In the dark Demon Ridge, Li Hao had reached Stage 3.He wasn't too surprised or surprised.It was not difficult to get to Level 3. It was only one step away. He had already built 220 bridges. From Level 1 to Level 3, it was just an accumulation of energy. It did not have a high requirement for Dao.Therefore, after killing a venerable sovereign and a dark Python, both of which were at level two, he only managed to reach level three ... It could only be said that he was just average.Even if he didn't enter this time, Li Hao would definitely enter the next time.The next step was to build the 360 bridges and step into the peak of Tier 3.At this stage, it was still the accumulation of energy.It was only when one had crossed four ranks that one would have a requirement for Dao and would need to have some breakthroughs in Dao."I still have to deal with one more dark Mantis!"Without the dark Dao accumulation crystal, Li Hao's current vision was even closer. It was less than 2000 meters. When he was at level two, he could see within 5000 meters with the Dao accumulation crystal.In addition, he had also seen a third level venerable sovereign. If possible, he would also take care of the other party.It was best if he could reach peak grade three here before leaving.At that time, he would start preparing to step into the middle-stage venerable sovereign realm.Li Hao dispersed his Darkness Domain again.He didn't know if he would be able to attract a stage three dark Python this time. If he attracted an even stronger one, he would continue to use the darkness Domain to cover it.With this thought in mind, Li Hao began to move forward.He deliberately made some noise and emitted some energy fluctuations.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  After reaching rank three, his strength had increased a lot, but there was no qualitative change. Although he was stronger than before, there was no change that crossed levels.This made Li Hao understand even more that the changes from Stage 1 to Stage 3 were not as great as he had imagined.It was no wonder that Hong Yue's venerable sovereign, who was probably at the third rank, could be killed by them.If he had encountered a fourth stage venerable sovereign that day ... There would have been almost no chance of turning the tables.Of course, to any force, a Tier 4 was a high level.Even in the great world, a medium venerable sovereign was a high-level venerable sovereign, not a weak one.The sector Lords of some great worlds were only at level six.……Li Hao revealed his aura. Gradually, some black swirls appeared around them. From their auras, there were first, second, and third level swirls, but there were no fourth level swirls. This meant that the swirls didn't appear randomly.Instead, it will be based on the fluctuations of your aura, and the corresponding ghastly puppet master will appear.For example, the second stage venerable sovereign had encountered the second stage Yin Chi, not the fourth or fifth stage Yin Chi.A moment later, Li Hao locked onto a Yin Chi.The yin Chi was not in human form. Instead, it looked like a bear from the demon race!It was extremely huge! He was obviously a strength-type powerhouse.Looking at his aura, he should be a strong stage three expert.The giant bear tried to attack Li Hao several times, but Li Hao dodged every time. Li Hao was not in a hurry to kill the giant bear. Instead, he ran around with a few Yin Chi. In fact, he was also searching for the other venerable sovereigns.He wasn't afraid of the 3rd rank, but he was more worried that GUI han was nearby.Once he fought with the rank three Yin Chi, he would easily cause a huge commotion and attract the attention of that person.However, after running around, he did not find any traces of the other party."Maybe he has entered the dark Shrine!"Li Hao came to a conclusion. After all, it had been six days since they entered this place. It was actually very normal for the other party to enter the darkness shrine after such a long time.After determining that the other party was probably not nearby, Li Hao did not delay any further.Soon, he stopped.This time, there were a few Yin Chi. Not only the giant bear, but there were also a few other Yin Chi, but they were not as strong as the giant bear.The river of life and death directly surrounded him!The dark domain appeared instantly.This time, the few Yin Chi were enveloped by Li Hao's domain.In essence, these Yin puppets were not as versatile as venerable sovereigns.The key was to be immortal!As long as the problem of their immortality was solved, these Yin puppets were actually much weaker than the venerable sovereigns. The changes in their Dao and techniques were not that much.It was more of a form of brute force.In addition, the most powerful thing was the high-level dark power, which had a certain ability to invade. This was the nature of the yin swirls.As soon as the domain appeared.The yin Chi seemed to have sensed the danger.At this moment, Li Hao's longsword appeared, and the power of life and death emerged from the firmament sword. Although the power of life and death was not as useful as he had imagined and could only deal limited damage to the yin Chi, it was indeed Li Hao's strongest attack at the moment.Life and death Sword!Li Hao's swordsmanship was actually very elegant.The longsword streaked across the void, illuminating an area in the darkness. It was exceptionally bright.The light of life and death emerged, and the stars were like brilliant fireworks.The bridges of life and death decorated Li Hao's bright moon sword.This time, there were a total of four Yin swirls that were enveloped. Other than the level three giant bear, there were two barbarian-like existences that were around level two. There was also a huge beast that was like a demonic beast, but it was only level one.At this moment, Li Hao's momentum was unstoppable!The longsword glowed with moonlight-like light. One hundred sword essences appeared and instantly increased to 360 sword essences. In the blink of an eye, the 360 sword essences increased to 720.Among them, the sword essences of life and death, water and fire, and darkness were all particularly powerful.

Chapter 2674 The Dark Shrine (2)
Apart from that, there were a few other sword intents that were also shining.One was Nirvana!The other was destruction.Nirvana came from the void, and destruction came from the chaos lightning tribulation.The Nirvana sword intent burst forth, and the world was silent. Although it was not as powerful as the void, it still killed a level-one venerable Emperor in Li Hao's small realm and destroyed the level-one demon beast in an instant!The demonic beast's corpse was still there, but the energy within its body had been instantly extinguished.The energy of a destructive world exploded, and the Taoist connotation circulated.In this dark world, it seemed particularly deserted.When he reached level two, the void seemed to be testing something or sharing some orthodoxies. Li Hao had gained some insights from the Dao of Nirvana.At this time, these few Yin Chi were also Li Hao's practice targets.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  It would be safer to practice with some venerated sovereigns when he had just entered the third rank.Li Hao's longsword kept releasing all kinds of sword intents. Among them, the power of destruction was extremely destructive. The power of the primal Chaos tribulation lightning was clearly harmful to the power of darkness."Destructive lightning ..."Li Hao thought as he attacked.Everything in the world seemed to have a corresponding Dao.And what was the corresponding Dao of destruction?If destruction corresponded to revival, then didn't destruction correspond to revival?Nirvana could be resurrected, but destruction ... New life?Nirvana, death, and destruction orthodoxies all gave Li Hao the feeling that they were somewhat similar. Even if there were some differences, they didn't seem to be too big.In the Dao of life and death, death corresponded to new life.p Then what does destruction correspond to?Li Hao could not find the connection for the time being. If he could, it might not be so troublesome the next time he encountered the chaos lightning. With the corresponding way, he might be able to directly devour the chaos lightning tribulation by fusing the two poles!Buzzzzzz!The sound of a sword rang out!Heaven and earth trembled.In the umbral realm, a Savage-like level two venerable sovereign was pierced through the head by Li Hao's sword. A destructive force burst out, and the opponent's body was instantly turned into dust.A crystal fell down.However, at this moment, the giant bear also slapped down. With a loud boom, Li Hao was forced back several steps, and a crack appeared on the firmament sword.Although it had devoured many treasures, the firmament sword did not seem to be able to withstand a full-force attack from a third stage venerable sovereign.At this moment, a faint crack appeared on the sword.This giant bear was really not weak.……While Li Hao was fighting with the yin Chi ...The fluctuation spread.Although the darkness Domain had blocked the invasion of a lot of Darkness Energy, it was still difficult to completely conceal the fluctuations of the energy. At this moment, about 2000 meters away from Li Hao.One of the venerable sovereigns looked grave.Haoyue?He saw it!In the distance, in the dark halo, Li Hao wielded his sword and easily killed a stage one Yin Chi. Soon, he killed another stage two Yin Chi. These undead creatures were quite difficult to deal with for all venerable sovereigns.But for Li Hao, it was easy to deal with.This was because Li Hao had broken his opponent's undying nature."Hao Yue ... A third rank venerable sovereign!"The venerable sovereign of The Dark World looked a little serious.This person was actually a third stage venerable sovereign.This was one of the reasons. Second, he was a sword cultivator and his swordsmanship was very powerful.Before that, there was news that venerable the sword had entered the Grand celestial world.Venerable Emperor Tian He of the Tianhe zone had even been killed by venerable sword.But now, not only was Haoyue concealing his strength, he was also a swordsman ... In an instant, this venerable sovereign couldn't help but think of many things, and his heart grew heavy. Could this Haoyue be related to that venerable sword?"That ring of light ... What is it?"He carefully observed it. This ring of light seemed to cut off the connection between the yin swirls and the outside world, thus breaking the undying nature of the yin swirls."This is ... A domain?"A thought emerged in his mind. He actually knew of such abilities.It seemed to be a domain.It was similar to heaven and earth, forming a system of its own that could isolate the inside from the outside.Many major cosmos absolute beings actually knew how to do it.Generally, almost all advanced venerable sovereigns had this kind of domain. They formed their own domain and isolated themselves from everything. They were the masters of the world. To the realm Masters of great worlds, a great world was actually a kind of enlarged domain!But ... This Hao Yue, how could he use such a domain?Until now, no one knew exactly what the key to the formation of domains was. There were no special methods to cultivate domains. Some domains were just born naturally.At that moment, the venerable sovereign was nervous and somewhat solemn.This Hao Yue, who was he?At this moment, a sharp sword sound was heard. The third Yin Chi had been killed, and only the giant bear was left.Inside Li Hao's territory, three Dao crystals were scattered.The giant bear was so strong that it looked like it was going to break the domain.The venerable sovereign was a little hesitant.Should I make a move?"Should I take this opportunity to attack this person and break his domain so that more dark Yin puppets can come? this person might be a threat. He wasn't very friendly to The Dark World before."Moreover, the other party used a sword, which made people couldn't help but think of the sword venerable of neo martial arts.In the nearby area, there were actually many swordsmen who used swords. However, the sword venerable of neo martial arts had special swordsmanship and was known as the one-Sword Hero. His explosive power was extremely strong!

Chapter 2675 Dark Shrine (3)
However, it was often only once.Although Li Hao's side was a little different from the other side, every time he unleashed an attack, he felt extremely powerful, as if he had exhausted everything ...Was this person related to the sword Saint?Of course, if the other party was weak, it didn't matter if they had any connections or not. They could attack if they wanted to. However, the other party was obviously not weak."If we wait any longer, the other party will kill the giant bear and take a few pieces of the Dao accumulation crystal. He might be even more difficult to deal with!"He finally made up his mind.Regardless of whether it had anything to do with venerable the sword, he was determined to kill the dark puppet just for the sake of the few Dao accumulation crystals. They might not be able to kill it, but this person could. The Dao accumulation crystal contained the Enlightenment of the great Dao of a level eight venerable sovereign.To a darkness-type powerhouse, it was a precious treasure!Although the other venerable sovereign had said that this crystal was only worth a few hundred thousand great Dao crystals, which was far less valuable than a small world, to a darkness-type cultivator, the comprehension of an eighth level venerable sovereign was more precious than a small world!Devouring a small world, there was a high probability that it would be difficult for a level three to advance to level four.However, if one comprehended some rank eight venerable sovereign Dao, it would not be difficult to advance from rank three to rank four.Moreover, it wasn't just one.Now, he had three.If Li Hao had killed another giant bear, he would have gotten four.At this moment, the venerable sovereign had an idea. He would take advantage of the time when the other party was fighting the giant bear. When both sides were exhausted, he would attack when Li Hao killed the giant bear, or when the giant bear killed Li Hao!……Back to the Dragon Temple.At this moment, Hui long Emperor was also watching intently. He couldn't see much, but he could see that Hao Yue was fighting with the dark swirls, and the light spots were overlapping.The other third level venerable sovereign of the dark great world was nearby, probably in hiding.Perhaps, he was waiting for an opportunity!"Let's try one last time!"At this moment, Supreme Emperor Hui long didn't care about Li Hao killing people, nor did he care about the Supreme emperors of the dark great world. Since he was ambushing Li Hao, his only thought was to test again. If this third rank Supreme Emperor was really ambushing Haoyue ... Haoyue might burst out with more powerful strength.I'll seal the dark Demon Ridge again!If the other party's strength didn't change this time ... He either didn't have a great Dao universe or his strength wasn't just level three. He might be level four or even level five ...In that case, it didn't matter whether there was the power of the great path or the universe.But if that was the case, a middle-rank venerable sovereign ... Could not possibly be the Silver Moon King 's.In fact, he didn't even think it was possible when he reached the third rank. It was almost impossible.However, he still felt a little unwilling in his heart.Therefore, he wanted to try one last time.……At this moment, Li Hao was engaged in a fierce battle with the giant bear.The bright moon sword Dao was also used to perfection. Life and death, destruction, Nirvana, darkness, water and fire ...All kinds of special sword essence exploded.The giant bear also started to weaken.Li Hao's eyes were cold. He glanced into the distance. Two thousand meters ... He could still see clearly. Although he was not a professional cultivator of the path of darkness, he had absorbed a lot of dark power.Therefore, the range of their vision was no smaller than that of the experts of the way of darkness.The other party might have thought that since he wasn't a cultivator of the dark element, his vision wasn't as far as his. He was only about two thousand meters away from him, yet he dared to stay. Did he think that he couldn't see him?"It looks like you're going to ambush me?"At such a short distance, venerable sovereigns could see clearly. If they were to launch a sneak attack, it would only take an instant.A stage three venerable sovereign's sneak attack ... Was not to be underestimated.However, he could see it, so it wasn't a sneak attack.Li Hao ignored him.In the next moment, a sword light pierced through the sky and earth, heading for the head of the giant bear!At the same time, the venerable sovereign not far away saw an opportunity. He instantly turned into a ghostly light and shot toward Li Hao's back like a dark arrow!This was the moment!At this moment, all of Li Hao's strength was focused on the giant bear. His defense, counterattack, and reaction were all at their slowest, which was his opportunity.He could tell that this person was really at the 3rd rank and wasn't hiding his strength.It was not the sword Saint!Since that was the case, this was his chance.The moment he made his move, Li Hao suddenly turned the sword ray around and charged at him. At the same time, the giant bear slapped down with its palm, and its dull eyes seemed to be at a loss.Why isn't it the same person from before?At that moment, a long river appeared in front of the bear. In the river, a cat looked at the bear with a helpless, depressed, and unhappy expression.What an ugly bear!Still dead fish eyes!Fish?Second cat thought, what an ugly fish ...No, it was not a fish.Forget it, they were all fish.At this moment, despite its frustration, second cat opened its mouth wide and tried to swallow the bear. It knew that Li Hao needed the dark Dao accumulation crystal. It didn't need to swallow the crystal. It just needed to devour the energy outside the bear's body.

However, he did not have time to think about it. A powerful dark power burst out instantly. This time, the dark power was mixed with an extremely powerful corrosive ability.

Chapter 2676 The Dark Shrine (3)_4
The void seemed to be shrouded in darkness and corroded.BOOM!When the sword radiance and the black Radiance collided, Li Hao took a few steps back. The black Radiance was also shattered, revealing the true face of the opponent. It was the rank three venerable sovereign he had seen earlier.His face was a little gloomy. He didn't say anything. He didn't miss his attack, but he didn't delay. He swept up a few dark Dao accumulation crystals on the ground. Since he couldn't kill them in one blow, he would give up and leave!It wouldn't be easy for Haoyue to deal with him.As long as he could find mi han, killing him would be a piece of cake. There was no need for him to take the risk.p "You want to leave after taking my things?"Li Hao's eyes turned cold. I'm the only one who takes others 'money. If others want to take mine, they have to ask first, right?If I don't give it to you, how dare you take it?"Life and death!"With a low shout, a black and white star seemed to appear in the sky. The star pressed down, and the Qi of life and death burst out of Li Hao's body. Vitality surged, and Li Hao's strength instantly expanded.The aura of death seeped out and instantly connected with the other party. The great Dao in the other party's body seemed to be wrapped in the aura of death.The venerable sovereign's face changed slightly. The power of darkness shook, and the death Qi seemed to be shaken away.However, at that moment, a destructive power entered his body.All of his power seemed to have been extinguished in an instant.The other party's body froze!At this moment, the chaos lightning tribulation suddenly appeared in the void. It was Li Hao's destructive power. A powerful Thunderbolt instantly exploded and exploded on the other party with a loud boom.The body of the venerable sovereign from The Dark World stiffened for a moment. The dark power in his body was shaken by the destructive power and was somewhat scattered.A lot of his life force dissipated in an instant."Life and death Emperor!"At this moment, this person was somewhat shocked. When Li Hao was dealing with the giant bear previously, he did not display much of his power because the power of life and death was not very effective. However, at this moment, when he was fighting with a living person, the venerable Emperor of life and death revealed his terrifying ability.His life force was extracted and the aura of death covered him.In an instant, the venerable sovereign felt a sense of danger and death.Not good!He wouldn't have been afraid of an ordinary third stage venerable Emperor even if they were of the same level, but a life and death Emperor ... In the chaosverse, life and death, yin and yang, these were all great DAOs, and Li Hao wasn't the only one cultivating them.Ordinary venerable sovereigns would be no match for them.Even though Li Hao could not kill a level four venerable sovereign, a level three venerable sovereign was no match for him, unless he encountered an expert who also cultivated the same great Dao.The other party's expression changed as he felt the overflowing life force. He suddenly let out a low shout, and more life force emerged. He instantly aged a bit, and the powerful life force overflowed between the heaven and earth.In an instant, Li Hao's power of life and death was shaken off. The next moment, he turned into a ghostly light and was about to escape.However, at this moment, a long river appeared, and the giant bear disappeared from where it had been.The moment the river appeared, it turned into a long whip and wrapped around the other party.In the long river, the power of 10000 DAOs burst out instantly, turning into countless giant swords that attacked the venerable sovereign."This is ... The river of Dao?"The venerable sovereign's expression changed slightly. It was impossible! How could a Dao master appear here?Yes, Daoist master.The master of the great Dao could be called the Dao master.This kind of long river, a long river of thousands of paths, was usually the symbol of the master of the great Dao. Therefore, he was shocked when a long river of the great Dao suddenly appeared here. How could it be?The master of the river of Dao was the weakest, usually at grade six.It represented the great world! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 But this Hao Yue, how could he be the master of the great Dao?At this place, the heaven and earth trembled. It was as if the heaven and earth had been isolated again. The venerable sovereign was delighted."Seal it!" He said.There seemed to have been one before, and the dark Demon Ridge seemed to have been sealed off.However, it didn't affect him, so he didn't care.But now, he was overjoyed.He sealed the world and cut off the connection of the great path.If that was the case, the other party would be the master of the great Dao, and the power of the great Dao would instantly weaken, cutting off its connection with the great Dao universe ...However, it was only for a moment before he was stunned.The river that surrounded him did not seem to be affected at all.How could this be?"It's not the river of Dao?"Such a thought appeared in his mind. This River did not come from the great Dao universe?How could that be possible!If it didn't come from the great Dao universe, could it still be called the great Dao River?For example, if Hong Yitang and the others appeared here and couldn't bring the universe of the great path, then the universe of the great path would be isolated, and the other party's River of the great path would instantly weaken greatly.But Li Hao didn 't.This was because this River was indeed not the river of the great path. It was all his own power that had been integrated and gathered. It was not external power or the power of the great path, but his own.Thus, sealing off the world, or even the entire world ... Didn't affect Li Hao much.He didn't care at all!The long river surrounded the other party, instantly tightening its grip.The next moment, a long sword, overflowing with the light of life and death, came over. The aura of death instantly enveloped the venerable sovereign. He was shocked."If you dare to kill me, the king of drought will not let you off!""Hmph!"Li Hao didn't even bother to reply.Even if you didn't ambush me, I wouldn't need to be afraid of anyone if I wanted to kill you.Seeing the long sword coming down, the other party's expression changed drastically and he made a choice.In an instant, his strong body exploded!A ghostly light broke through the air and was about to escape.

Chapter 2677 The Dark Shrine (3)_5
Venerable sovereigns were not easy to kill.The powerful explosion caused the river to shake violently. The sword radiance also exploded instantly.At this moment, Li Hao shouted,""Nirvana!"A destructive force instantly spread out.The surrounding void was instantly destroyed.Everything in the world seemed to have withered, as if they had lost all vitality.The ghostly light also froze for a moment.Just as the other party was about to recover, a destructive force descended once more. With a loud boom, the powerful force of Thunder exploded once again, blasting the dark light into pieces!"Water and fire!"Li Hao attacked again. At this moment, fire and water mixed in the air, and two phantoms appeared, one from the fire element mountain and the other from the Taoist connotation in the Tianhe zone.Fire and water blended!The two forces instantly swept across the world and exploded with a boom. All the ghostly lights were completely shattered!Life and death, Li Hao had comprehended it himself.Destruction came from the chaos lightning tribulation.Nirvana came from emptiness.Fire and water were two venerable sovereigns from the Grand celestial world. One was at the seventh rank, while the other was at the sixth rank.If he couldn't even kill a cultivator of the same level with such an inheritance and such means, Li Hao could just commit suicide.He had lived in vain!In an instant, screams resounded in all directions.Li Hao didn't care. Instead, he looked up at the sky with a cold expression. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Once was fine, it could be considered a coincidence.Two times!Two times in a row, when he burst out to kill, the heaven and earth were sealed. If he were a cultivator of the Dao universe, this moment would be enough for him to suffer, and it was normal to be killed by the enemy."Return to the Dragon!"Li Hao's expression turned ugly.It was obvious that he was targeting or testing her.Two times in a row, the other party had sealed off the world. He should be able to sense something, such as who he had encountered, about to attack, about to explode ... In short, at this time, the other party sealed off the dark Demon Ridge.If it wasn't for the fact that his River of Life and death didn't belong to the Dao universe, wouldn't he be finished?Originally, he didn't have much interest in venerable Dragon Emperor, who was a smooth and slick powerhouse. As for the other party's intention to hunt for new martial artists ... That was his business. Li Hao would only do what he could.However, this time, the other party had tested him twice in a row. If it wasn't for his good luck, he might have fallen.All of a sudden, the enmity between the two sides was huge!"Return to the Dragon!"After mumbling to himself again, the coldness in Li Hao's eyes disappeared.He would not let this guy go.Although he was only at the third step and his opponent was at the sixth step ... He would not let Li Hao go, even if he didn't care about that.Sealing off the world twice in a row was too annoying!The long river swept across the world, and everything, including the dark Dao accumulation crystal of the giant bear, fell into Li Hao's hands. The killed stage three venerable sovereign was washed away by the water of the long river, and his energy was purified.This third level venerable sovereign should be enough for him to build some more bridges. Li Hao would also consume the dark Dao accumulation crystals of the other three Yin Chi, leaving only the black bear behind. He reached out his hand and the dark Dao accumulation crystal of the giant bear fell into his hand.Li Hao looked around. He was quite lucky this time.With a single glance, he could see everything within a radius of seven to eight thousand meters.Good stuff!He raised his head to look at the sky and soon, he ran in one direction.……Back to the Dragon Temple.Hui long Emperor spat out a mouthful of blood and frowned in disappointment.He really wasn 't!It had nothing to do with the great Dao universe.In addition, this Hao Yue was very powerful. When he encountered the dark ghastly puppet and the third level venerable sovereign of The Dark World, he was able to kill them both.That thing was almost indestructible.This Haoyue had a secret.However, he was probably not an expert from a great world or a great path universe.Which venerable sovereign did not have a secret?To the peak rank six venerable sovereign Hui long, if there were only some secrets, it would be useless. What he wanted was a great Dao universe, a great Dao universe with no one in control, or a great Dao universe with a weak controller!But now ... The other party was not.He was a little disappointed.It was very rich!I'm so disappointed. In this case, my only hope is in the Outlander world. If it doesn't recover, it'll be very difficult for me to reach Level Seven.Or, if the other great worlds are destroyed, the bed universe will be left behind and controlled by me.But ... How could that be possible!Even if the great cloud world behind him destroyed a great world, it would not hand over the universe to him. The great cloud world also had some level six venerable sovereigns.Although he was also considered the other party's direct descendant, he had not reached that stage. It would be difficult to split him.Besides, Yunxiao was low-key and not like neo martial, who caused trouble everywhere, so it was difficult to have such an opportunity."Tian Fang ..."Murmuring, he thought of Haoyue again.A third stage venerable sovereign. Moreover, he was a strong third stage venerable.This time, he had killed two venerable sovereigns of The Dark World.If mi han came out ... Perhaps, he could tell Hao Yue and Kong Ji that one was a rank 5 and the other a rank 3.On Xi Han's side, there was one level 5 and two level 3.This Hao Yue wasn't a weak third rank. One against two ...... It just so happened that it would be a draw, as this would restrict both sides.He wasn't worried about anything, nor was he afraid that Haoyue would discover anything.He was a sixth rank venerable sovereign, so he was confident.Unless a major cosmos absolute being, a Type 7 one, personally dealt with him, he was fearless.

Chapter 2678 Dark Shrine (1)-6
At this moment, he didn't have any intention of killing Li Hao.Since it's not the Silver Moon King, then it's the power of my Dragon Temple. Why should I destroy it?If it was the Silver Moon King, he could make a move.Moreover, the other party was on good terms with Kong Ji.Just as he was thinking about all this, a voice suddenly rang in his ears."Supreme Emperor, the two outbursts of power seem to be related to the dark Demon Ridge. Could it be that something has happened there?"At this moment, only the middle-stage venerable sovereigns could send a voice transmission to him.And at this moment, the voice that came was none other than Kong Ji.Obviously, Kong Ji also felt it. He didn't try to hide it and directly questioned him.Hui Long's voice carried a hint of a smile,"it's nothing. It seems to have provoked some dark Yin Chi. I'm currently expelling it ... Brother kongji, don't worry. That Haoyue is still alive and well!" However ... I can vaguely tell that this Haoyue ... Seems ... To have killed an expert from The Dark World ... If brother mi han were to find out about this, I'm afraid you'll be in big trouble. ""You're all from the Dragon Temple. I don't want you to have any conflicts ... Of course, it might be a misunderstanding. Don't worry, I'll deal with it after we come out!"What he meant was to tell Kong Ji that he knew the secret.If he wanted to live in peace with mi han, he had to be more careful and honest. Otherwise, he would become a mortal enemy of mi han."Oh ... I know."Kong Ji didn't seem surprised. In fact, he wasn 't.He only replied indifferently before his voice disappeared.The venerable Dragon Emperor raised his eyebrows and looked in his direction. What did this guy mean?You know?'Do you understand what I mean, or ... Do you not care?'At this moment, it was hard to judge.They would know everything when they came out.The three of them had entered the dark Shrine in the dark Demon Ridge, and Hao Yue was currently heading there as well. It was unknown whether they would meet again.This time, there were some changes in the dark Demon Ridge.He didn't know if these people would have any gains.As he thought about it, he didn't say anything else.He couldn't see them after they entered the dark Shrine.This time, he could only rule out the bright moon and silver Moon King's identity as a great world's expert. Anything else didn't mean much to him, and he didn't gain much.p ……At this moment, Li Hao didn't waste any more time and continued forward.He headed straight for the darkness shrine!He had a strong sense of direction.It was easy to determine the direction of the darkness shrine. Moreover, he could also tell a thing or two from the terrain.In addition, he had the dark Dao accumulation crystal in his hand, so he could see further and travel faster.At the same time, the stage three venerable sovereign's energy, as well as the other three Dao accumulation crystals, were all devoured and cultivated in the long river, building more bridges between life and death.Moreover, as Li Hao killed a few dark Mantis, he discovered that more and more dark Mantis seemed to be gathering around him.Although the darkness Domain still had some use, it was still better to enter the darkness shrine as soon as possible.It was to avoid being targeted by these Yin Chi.After walking for half a day, Li Hao finally saw a huge temple.The huge door of darkness closed.Waves of dark aura overflowed from the divine Hall. This was the source of the dark energy in the dark Demon Ridge. At this moment, this dark energy seemed to be a little agitated."The darkness shrine, the cultivation place of an eighth-rank secret agent ... Perhaps it's also a place where treasures like the divine text exist!"The dark Demon Ridge might have been built on the foundation of this temple.Li Hao glanced at it without much hesitation.It didn't matter if Xi han was in there or if there was any danger in there ... Since they were already here, if they didn't go in and just stood outside hesitating, they would be wasting time.If he wasted too much time here, he would miss the time he had agreed to meet venerable sovereign Yi and the others.Although he didn't need to act with them, if he did ... He should be able to find Heaven's Fate and the others directly and avoid missing them.The next moment, Li Hao pushed open the dark door.He stepped into the dark Shrine.…… The moment Li Hao entered the dark Shrine, a futon in the depths of the dark Shrine trembled slightly.Vaguely, there seemed to be a voice spreading,""FIRE movement, water movement, physical body movement ..." Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The aura of the Taoist connotation of many envoys?Someone had obtained the inheritance of these people?How could that be possible?One was fine, but three? that was almost impossible.Even if someone was willing to impart it to him, it was still possible if it was only one person. However, if the second person had sensed the aura of another person, he probably wouldn't impart it to him anymore. After all, a powerful venerable sovereign's inheritance wasn't something that could be obtained easily.If he was a person, he would pass it on to you.It was unbelievable that three venerable sovereigns had passed their inheritance to one person."No wonder ..."The soft sound reverberated again.It was no wonder that the dark Yin swirls were so agitated this time. It was not something that could be controlled by this side. It was because they might have sensed the aura of someone familiar, the aura of someone who had been an emissary in the past.Perhaps, it was a gesture of welcome.He welcomed the arrival of the other heaven's side experts.Only this weak voice reverberated in the entire Hall.Around him, images appeared out of thin air. Some of them showed the figures of some people, such as mi han, the other two venerable sovereigns, and Li Hao.These people were all in the darkness shrine, but they did not seem to be with each other.The futon trembled once more, but it soon returned to silence.In the entire Hall, only those few images remained.……At the same time.Pi han turned his head to look in a direction and frowned slightly.He had been inside for more than a day, but the darkness shrine, which didn't look very big from the outside, was completely dark. He was a fifth rank venerable sovereign, but he couldn't see anything.It was no wonder that in the records of the great dark world, people who had come before had found nothing!This seemed to be an empty Hall!There was nothing.However ... It was impossible for them to be from empty Hall.After entering, he had chosen to split up with the other two venerable sovereigns and look for opportunities on their own. However, he had not found any, so it was likely that it would be difficult for the other two."The darkness shrine ... Really has nothing? Or ... It's just that I didn't encounter it, and the opportunity isn't with me?"He frowned slightly and was a little unhappy.In addition, the aura of ultimate darkness ... Seemed to be weaker than before.The great path universe had collapsed, and only six venerable sovereigns had survived. The dark aura was already very weak. Now, he felt that the dark aura was even weaker than before. He wondered if something had happened to the venerable sovereigns outside.When they entered, only three of the six venerable sovereigns had entered The Dark Divine Palace. The other three were still unaware of the situation.Mi han was a little irritated. If they didn't gain anything this time and some of them were killed ... It would be another huge loss for The Dark World. The once prosperous great world only had six venerable sovereigns.One or two less was still acceptable in the past, but now ... It was an unbearable loss.……At this moment, Li Hao, who had stepped into the darkness shrine, was also instantly enveloped by darkness.The darkness was even more severe than before!The whole world was in darkness. Even with the dark Dao accumulation crystal in his hand, Li Hao could only see the scene within a thousand meters ... It was as if there was nothing.After removing the crystal, he could only see the scene within a 100-meter radius.He was a third stage venerable sovereign!There must be some treasure in the dark Divine Palace. Otherwise, it would not be possible to restrict a venerable sovereign in such a way."The core of the domain!"Li Hao had some ideas. This place must be the core of the entire Dark Demon Ridge. This was the source of the dark force.There must be a treasure similar to Holy prose in this place.I don't know if I can find it or even take it away!

Chapter 2679 Light Pole Commander (1)
Darkness enveloped Li Hao.Even with the darkness-type Dao accumulation crystal, Li Hao could only probe within a range of 1000 meters.The surroundings were empty.Was this the scene inside the darkness shrine?What kind of temple was this without anything?Or could it be that experts didn't need external objects to cultivate and just had a place to seclude themselves?If that was the case, it was understandable.In that case, it didn't seem like he had gained much.If they continued to search like this ... Would they be able to find the treasure?Li Hao didn't run around anymore.At this moment, he found a random place, squatted down, and began to think.Domain ... Core ... Divine text ...If he were to create a domain, where would he place the core?And how would he come into contact with it?One's domain depended on one's luck, comprehension, and orthodoxy ... However, his comprehension of the Dao of darkness wasn't too strong. It would be difficult for him to enter the core of the domain based on his comprehension.Should I ... Turn back time?That way, it would be easier to comprehend the other party's orthodoxy.However ... It would be troublesome if he met someone who was hard to talk to. Li Hao was very wary of dark-type powerhouses and did not dare to use them rashly. Also, it was not good to use the power of time too much."How troublesome!"Li Hao mumbled. The next moment, he sensed the dense power of darkness around him, and his heart skipped a beat.Should I ... Cultivate first?There was no hurry.It's fine if I can't get any benefits. I've just killed a third rank venerable sovereign and a few dark puppets. I'll cultivate first and build some bridges between life and death.Li Hao was also very bold. When others entered this place, they would immediately look for treasures, but Li Hao knew that there were probably not many treasures here. Even if there were, it was highly unlikely that he would get his hands on them.He was afraid that he would not be able to enter the core area right now. Rather than trying his luck, he might as well cultivate first.This was the source of the darkness, so it would be easier to cultivate here.Soon, he sat down cross-legged and the river appeared. Dark energy was being absorbed by him.Although second cat told Li Hao to absorb less dark energy ... It was too much, so it would be a waste if he didn't absorb it. He just had to find a way to neutralize it.In the dark Shrine, three of the four venerable sovereigns were still searching for treasures. Li Hao, on the other hand, had begun to cultivate as soon as he entered, as if this place was his training ground.When powerhouses came to the darkness shrine, who would come for cultivation?Even if the energy was rich, to experts, energy was not important. The key was the treasures and Taoist connotation, not the pure energy.……In the depths of the dark Shrine.The hall where the praying mat was placed was as quiet as ever.At this moment, four images appeared in the surroundings. The other three were still trying to find a way, but Li Hao was sitting cross-legged and cultivating.The originally silent Hall seemed to have some movement again."Training?" Did he come here to cultivate?This venerable sovereign with the power of three emissaries was interesting.Pretending to be calm?Or did he know that the darkness shrine might have something, so he wanted to use this unique method to get some attention?To powerhouses, there were many times when they would think about many things.The three cultivators of the power of darkness and this ... Seemed to be a cultivator of the Dao of life and death. The Dao of life and death was not bad, but it was only not bad. If he could not reach a high level, the Dao of life and death would only be a relatively powerful great Dao.In this place, the most powerful Dao was naturally the Dao of darkness."Are you deliberately mystifying things?"The voices in the hall resounded once more, as if they were interested.If it was anyone else, he didn't need to care.However, he had the aura of three emissaries, so he could pay some attention to him.In the next moment, a wave of dark fluctuation spread out from the hall.……At the same time.Li Hao, who was in the middle of training, suddenly felt his heart skip a beat.The next moment, a voice came from the darkness. He turned his head and felt his scalp go numb. The hall that was empty just a moment ago suddenly had dozens of dark Yin phoenixes!Dozens of them!This was an existence at the venerable sovereign level.Even if they were only first level venerable sovereigns, if they joined forces to attack, they would still be in great trouble.Li Hao instantly activated his Darkness Domain.How could there be so many dark Yin swirls here?With the emergence of the darkness Domain, the yin Chi seemed to have lost their senses and headed elsewhere. Li Hao immediately heaved a sigh of relief. It was frightening.Just as he was thinking ... The next moment, his expression changed slightly.The darkness Domain suddenly shook.His dark power instantly went out of control, and a flaw appeared in his domain. The dark Yin swirls that had left reappeared.p Li Hao immediately frowned.His dark energy was a little out of control ... This was impossible. He was a third rank venerable sovereign. He didn't dare to say that he could easily control his power, but he wouldn't lose control so easily.There was a problem! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 His expression changed slightly, and he didn't have the time to think about this. The dark swirls were already chasing after him. Once he lost his domain, it meant that he couldn't isolate their undying nature.At that time, not to mention dozens of them, even one ... Would be enough to make him suffer.Something had happened to the dark Shrine.It shouldn't have been like this in the past.Otherwise, whoever came would be finished.Is it related to me?Or did it have something to do with the people from The Dark World? Li Hao was certain that something must have been triggered that caused this.He really wanted those Taoist connotation crystals, but the dozens of venerable sovereign-level dark puppets were all immortal, so he gave up!
