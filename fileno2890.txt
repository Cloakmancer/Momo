However, if they waited a little longer and he really became the master of a seventh-rank great Dao, he would still be in his own territory. By then, he would be even more difficult to deal with than the awakening God venerable Emperor."Let's wait and see!"Venerable the sword was not a hesitant person. He continued to wait and said after a while,""That kid Li Hao seems to have some plans ... I'm waiting to see what he thinks."A plan?Kong Ji, on the other hand, felt that it was normal. Li Hao, regardless of whether he was confident or not, would come up with a few plans first.In fact ... There was no hesitation in giving up when it was time to give up.Kong Ji didn't think that Li Hao was planning anything, but was just making a normal arrangement.However, since the sword Saint had said so, he could only nod.Then let's wait and see!He also considered it for a while and said,""Daoist Hao Yue, you've exposed yourself in Senlan and are even driving away those venerable sovereigns for us. Perhaps you're trying to stir up conflict between Senlan and the other worlds and benefit from it?"Venerable the sword shook his head. He was not wrong, but he did not know Li Hao well.I don't know this person very well.As for the Silver Moon King ... He was curious and interested. However, he could not tell what kind of person he was. The only person he could compare himself with was the king.This Silver Moon King and the human King were two completely different personalities, two extremes.The human King was in a rush. He would do whatever he thought of and say whatever he thought of. He would almost never hide anything. In fact, it was very comfortable to communicate with him, although some people were not used to it.This Silver Moon King ... After interacting with him for a while, he had been polite, but it didn't really fit the style of a neo martial artist. However, he had acted when he needed to, dealing with a tier 7 whenever he said he would. At the critical moment, he was quite decisive.Sword Saint also wanted to see how this person planned to take over a macro world without him.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Was he a wise man like the Supreme martial artist, or was he something else?"Senior," Kong Ji suddenly said,"if fellow Daoist Hao Yue took down the forest orchid world by himself ... We won't fight with him, right?"“……”What did that mean?Venerable the sword glanced at him and understood.Good fellow!Was this guy trying to say that if Li Hao took down Sen LAN alone, they wouldn't be worthy of sharing the loot?You're so generous ... Rich second generations are different."Of course!" He smiled and nodded."Yeah, I think so too."Kong Ji also laughed, while venerable the sword was speechless. Li Hao and this person had only known each other for a short time, but their friendship was quite deep.…… Just as everyone was quiet.Outside forest regional wall.In the primal Chaos void, three venerable sovereigns came together.One was at the fourth stage, and the other two were at the third stage. The energy on their bodies was extremely powerful, and they even concealed the aura of the great Dao. They were the three venerable sovereigns from the Crimson Moon universe. Of course, they had some scruples and had changed their appearances.However, who would look at venerable sovereigns?If it weren't for the fact that they wanted to save face ... They wouldn't have been the only ones to come. At this moment, Crimson Moon Tier 5 and Tier 6 cultivators hadn't even appeared. If they did, then Sen Lan's side would have to resist.Therefore, the strongest among them was only a fourth stage venerable sovereign.The three venerable sovereigns were all filled with killing intent!Recently, on the red moon's side, the venerable sovereigns 'attitudes had changed greatly. First, a level Seven was killed, and then the sector Lord said that a new level Seven would be born. It made people both afraid and expectant.Although it was difficult for a Tier 4 to have the chance to reach tier 7, when Tier 6 went up, Tier 4 would naturally rise as well.Limited space!Now, if he captured Senlan and made a contribution to the assimilation of the Senlan world, he would naturally have a chance.The newly arrived fourth level venerable sovereign's face was cold. Before he even arrived, he snorted,""Wu Ju, that trash, watched as I, Red Moon sovereign, was killed. He couldn't take revenge and could only ask for help ... He lost all his face!"He was talking about the fourth stage venerable sovereign. He was also telling the two beside him that when they arrived at Senlan, they had to listen to him. That trash had watched a third stage venerable sovereign get killed. If they followed him, they would not have a good end. Two 3rd rank experts, one male and one female, were both extremely handsome.The Empress's smile was as beautiful as a flower, and she exuded a strong sense of charm.""What my Lord said is right. If not, he wouldn't have asked my Lord to come to help. The realmlord trusts my Lord. Otherwise, this opportunity that everyone wanted was right at their doorstep. There are many middle stage venerable sovereigns in the middle realm, but in the end, my Lord still came."The handsome man beside her also smiled brightly.""That's right, Lord Yu Ce is valued by the realm Lord ... I think that soon, there will be a place for Lord Yu Ce in level five, or even level six. At that time, I hope Lord Yu Ce can give me some guidance!"Yu Ce smiled, he was very satisfied with their reactions.He didn't say anything else.As long as these two don't listen to me, I'll have the final say on Senlan and Crimson moon's side."Let's not talk about other things. This time, as long as we kill those guys ... It will be a Meritorious Service! A group of rogue cultivators, you dare to kill my people, you're courting death!"His face was cold and stern. Where wouldn't a venerable sovereign of an eighth-level universe be arrogant?He was killed in front of his house, how hateful!Soon, the three of them headed for a crack. Instead of going to Li Hao's place, they went to Red Moon 's.……Near the crack.The red moon's venerable sovereign immediately opened his eyes and saw the three people crossing the chaos in the distance. He frowned slightly. Yu Ce was here, how troublesome.

The two of them didn't get along very well.But ... That's good.One level four and two level three. It seemed that the inner realm attached great importance to them. Although there were many Red Moon emperors, they had suffered great losses recently. Li Hao had killed several Red Moon emperors and a few Level Seven ones ...Now, in the early stage, she could mobilize many venerable sovereigns here. Only Hong Yue had this strength."Yu Ce!"Emperor limitless stood up and the three of them arrived in an instant."Wuju, where's Daoist Wan?" Yu CE's face turned cold.Emperor limitless frowned slightly and said softly,""He's on the other side, but there's one thing ... Senlan is protecting him. Don't act rashly, or it'll easily cause Senlan to resist! "At this stage, the Rogue cultivators have already formed an alliance. As long as we stimulate a war to break out between the two sides and disturb the entire Senlan, we can take advantage of the chaos in Senlan and use it as an excuse to suppress the rebellion. For the sake of the red moon Alliance's smooth progress, we can suppress the entire place ..."He felt that since the myriad DAOs was valued by the forest orchid sector Lord, why not just go with the flow and let these fellows fight against the Rogue cultivators?  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ As long as chaos erupted, it wouldn't be up to sector Lord Sen LAN anymore."Hmph! Is there a need to go through so much trouble?"Yu Ce said in a low voice,"kill them directly!" They're just a group of outsiders. After we kill them, the wandering cultivators will see the opportunity and naturally take action. Do you expect those timid wandering cultivators to take the initiative?""No, it's the group from the myriad DAOs sect. They're rather flamboyant!""They took the initiative to provoke those itinerant cultivators. I think they'll make a move again sooner or later!"“……”As soon as the two of them came, they began to fight for the right to speak to Sen LAN.The two third level venerable sovereigns remained silent.They didn't dare to say anything when the two 4th rank experts argued.……At the same time.Li Hao's eyes flickered as he looked into the distance.In the distance, a crack appeared, and three more venerable sovereigns, two fourth-rank and two third-rank, appeared.The red moon had come to help!Red Moon was still rich and overbearing.In total, Li Hao had killed four of Red moon's venerable sovereigns. Including the level Seven venerable sovereigns, there were five. During the conflict between red Moon and new martial arts, although there had been no large-scale battle over the years, several venerable sovereigns had died when they ambushed venerable sword.In total, more than 10 venerable sovereigns had died in Hongyue.But on the other side, venerable sovereigns continued to appear.Middle-stage venerable sovereigns were rarely seen, but in the red moon, they were as common as cabbages."Are you done with your training?" Li Hao stood up.Everyone nodded in agreement. Li Hao said,"there are 11 rifts. Apart from our side, there are 10 more. Senlan is in charge of five of them. All of them have middle-stage venerable sovereigns!" The other five are controlled by four major worlds, and the last one is controlled by a rank six itinerant cultivator. ""And these rifts are almost all guarded by mid-rank cultivators!"There were almost all of them!Apart from them, this was the second place that Hong Yue was in charge of, so only three individual cultivators were in charge. However, they were at least third level venerable sovereigns, which was not too weak."And we have already made an enemy of the Crimson Moon!"Li Hao looked at them."That's why ... I want ... To continue dealing with the crack that the red moon wields!"“……”Everyone took a deep breath. Although Qian Wuliang felt that he could reach Level 3 at any time, he was still worried."They seem to have sent reinforcements ...""Two rank four and two rank three!"This ...Putting aside the fact that Li Hao had only displayed strength at the third step, even if Li Hao could deal with a fourth step, it would be difficult for them to deal with one fourth step and two third step cultivators.It had exceeded his expectations!"We're not going to deal with the Rogue cultivators?""Although there are level four cultivators among the itinerant cultivators, they're easier to deal with than those from the great world,"Heaven's Fate said with some doubts.If it didn't work, the other major worlds could do it too.Why did he continue to deal with the red moon Emperor?"This way ... I'll have an excuse to advance to the 4th rank!" Li Hao said softly.What?Li Hao said softly, I want to advance to the fourth step! I took a risk and killed two third rank venerable sovereigns, devoured their power of great DAOs, and forcibly advanced to the fourth rank. I absorbed a large number of great Dao crystals, and with the inheritance of two third rank venerable sovereigns, I had no obstacles in advancing. I broke through during the battle and advanced to the fourth rank, then killed the remaining two fourth rank venerable sovereigns ... In this way, I could advance smoothly. "As for why he didn't reveal his stage four strength at the beginning ... It couldn't be helped, as it was almost impossible for a rogue cultivator to enter stage four.Here, he had obtained hundreds of millions of great Dao crystals, killed a few Red Moon sovereign, and obtained countless great Dao power. Advancing now was more in line with the situation of an independent cultivator.In addition, mid-ranked itinerant cultivators were quite famous in the primordial chaos.Li Hao, a nobody, had arrived with the strength of an intermediate magician. He had long been thoroughly investigated."The few of you ... Only have one goal, and that is to stop the two rank four venerable sovereigns!"He looked at the crowd, and they all felt a little pressured.Stop the two fourth stage venerable sovereigns! Li Hao continued,"everyone is happy to see red Moon sovereign killed. However, it's the opposite for others. Someone will definitely stop them!" On the other hand, the Crimson Moon is powerful and frightening. On the other hand, they are the overlords. Without permission, no one will rashly interfere ... This is our chance to kill them. ""As Lord Marquis commands!""Please arrange everything, Marquis! We will do our best!" Qian Wuliang said hurriedly.

Li Hao nodded and said,"senior uncle Hong, Qian Wuliang, two celestial pole seniors, you guys hold off a stage 4!" The rest of you, keep one of them busy. "Everyone looked at each other. There would definitely be some difficulty.The gap between Tier 4 and Tier 3 was still not small.However, if the two Dao Masters advanced ... There would be no more pressure.Li Hao continued,'I'll go kill two level three venerable sovereigns! Before I kill them ...... You all must stop them and give me time to advance. ""I'll give it a try this time. I'll use the fire elemental Dao to forcefully enter the 4th rank. Perhaps ... I can advance!" He smiled.He might not be lying.His fire elemental power wasn't weak, so it wasn't impossible for him to reach the fourth rank with his fire elemental power. This would be more realistic. Of course, if it really didn't work, then he would fake it. Using life, death, Nirvana, and recovery as the foundation, he would imitate the fire element and enter the 4th rank again. At that time, there might be some flaws."I'll kill one at the fourth step," Li Hao said."Has Huai King and Sen LAN talked about the price?"King Huai nodded,"we did. What they mean is ... They want us to try not to get into a conflict with a middle-stage venerable sovereign!" If we really get into a conflict, and we can kill a level four venerable sovereign, the other party is willing to pay 50 million great Dao crystals. "Many people cursed in their hearts when they heard this.It would be better to kill two tier 3 players!Two 3rd rank experts could already earn 60 million, and killing a 4th rank expert was much more difficult than killing two 3rd rank experts.King Huai continued,"in addition, the other party said that they have small worlds, but they usually won't exchange them for outsiders!" "If we really kill a stage four ... This can be considered a bargaining chip. If we kill a stage four, the other party is willing to give up a small world as part of the price, which is a small world and 40 million great Dao crystals."Li Hao frowned slightly.A small world was equivalent to a Tier 4!Did this Senlan person not believe that he could kill a stage four, or was he not willing to trade a small world with him?The probability was that he was unwilling and did not believe it.A small world was actually better than a great Dao crystal. Of course, this was only for venerable sovereigns of great worlds.Two fourth stage venerable sovereigns ...I can only exchange for two small worlds?Including his, there were only three. In that case, it would be very difficult to satisfy er Mao's appetite!However, now that he had advanced to the 4th rank, the difficulty of killing another 4th rank would be much lower.Of course, there would still be trouble later on. It all depended on if sector Lord Sen LAN was willing to give him some support!Li Hao did not have any psychological burden in killing venerable Red Moon.Getting rid of evil for the people!Who asked these guys to offend not only neo martial, but also him?"Realm Lord! I'll borrow the power of the world!"Li Hao's power of great Dao fluctuated, as if he were praying to heaven and earth.This was also one of the previous conditions.A moment later, sector Lord Sen LAN seemed to have sensed it. At this moment, a faint power of heaven's will and world Energy appeared on everyone's bodies. The repulsion that the heaven and earth had towards them earlier had dissipated.This was the magical effect of world force!The impact wasn't too great, but they had the advantage of being native. "Thank you, sector Lord!" Li Hao revealed a smile.No one responded.……Within the Sen LAN great Dao universe, sector Lord Sen LAN was currently refining the entire great Dao universe. At this moment, he was filled with suspicion.Who should he attack?This myriad DAOs Emperor was interesting.There were also a few people under him who were infinitely close to rank three ... Their strength had grown rapidly. It seemed that they were addicted to killing venerable sovereigns and obtaining a large number of great Dao crystals.Just as he was thinking, his heart moved.This group of people ... Was heading ... To the Crimson Moon?Such courage!No way?In fact, he was very angry that two middle-stage venerable sovereigns had come from Hong Yue, but he couldn't say anything. 'Are these ten thousand DAOs ... Really crazy? or do they think that they're not afraid of these guys because they have the power of the world?'"He's still targeting the Crimson Moon ... Is the ignorant fearless?"Soon, he laughed.It was a good thing!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Even the venerable sovereigns of Senlan were afraid of Hong Yue and didn't dare to attack her. It was in his interest to have this group of fools attack her, but ... A group of low-rank venerable sovereigns against two mid-rank venerable sovereigns was unlikely.He quickly sent a voice transmission,'old Yan, be careful! The myriad DAOs sect has gone to deal with Hong Yue. If things go south and there are any mistakes, it's fine if a few venerable sovereigns die, but protect the myriad DAOs sect!"……In the outside world.The eyes of the other sixth level venerable sovereign of Senlan, Yan Fang, flickered.Such courage!It had only been a few days since they had been provoking the Rogue cultivators. He thought that they would at most attack the Rogue cultivators, but it turned out to be Hong Yue, and it was after Hong Yue's reinforcements!He quickly stood up and disappeared from where he was. He entered the void and was ready to save her at any time.It didn't matter if a few of the myriad DAOs Academy's subordinates died, as long as the myriad DAOs Academy was still alive.They still needed the myriad DAOs to break through some of the situation.……At the same time.In the crack where Hong Yue's side was, several venerable sovereigns were still arguing. Wu Jin and Yu Ce, the two fourth level venerable sovereigns, didn't want to pay attention to each other. One thought that the other was too timid, and the other thought that the other was brainless.As he said that, Wu Jin's expression changed and he looked into the distance.Yu Ce was the same. He looked surprised and shocked. He glanced at bind and asked,"it's them?"Bind nodded!Yu Ce suddenly laughed,"Wuju, I was wrong about you. It's not that you are weak, it's not that you are coward...It's these people, they are too crazy!"There were two fourth-rank and two third-rank venerable sovereigns here, and they were venerable sovereigns from the great world. The strongest among these lunatics was only a third-rank venerable sovereign. Although there were more people, it was of no use!

Are you trying to scare us?They actually took the initiative to attack us.Yu Ce couldn't believe it, even a little suspicious. He laughed and said,""They ... Are they here to apologize?"He had no choice but to think so.He didn't believe that venerable sovereigns would be so stupid and stupid to attack his side.Bind was also stunned for a moment before he said in a low voice,""Be careful of Senlan!"Don't be careless!These people weren't scary. The key was the situation on Senlan's side.Yu Ce instantly understood!He hurriedly checked his surroundings. These people didn't matter to him. He didn't care at all. The key was Senlan's venerable sovereign. If Senlan's middle-stage venerable sovereign intervened ... It would be troublesome.After searching for a while, he didn't discover anything. However, he didn't dare to be careless because this was the territory of Senlan. Sector Lord Senlan could descend at any time."This place is the Senlan territory. Foreign venerable sovereigns, leave quickly!"Li Hao's voice rose again, carrying boundless pressure.In an instant, the entire forest world fell silent again.……At the wandering cultivators 'side.The two middle-stage venerable sovereigns looked at the sky. Suddenly, one of them laughed,""Damn it, he's an imbecile...Forget about them!"Are you looking for death?Last time, you killed a Tier 3 expert. Are you so arrogant that you don't put the world in your eyes?He even dared to attack Hong Yue!This group of itinerant cultivators couldn't believe it.How could there be such a crazy and stupid venerable sovereign!Just a moment ago, everyone was still discussing whether they should attack these guys. Now, there was no need to do so anymore. This group of lunatics was dead for sure. Let's see how many Red Moon sovereign can kill.While they were talking, Yu Ce laughed in the sky,""You're really bold! It looks like ... You've tasted the sweetness once and feel that the people in the world are only so-so?""Are you going to retreat?"Li Hao's voice resounded through the world,"don't retreat, attack!" The forest world can not allow outsiders to be impudent!"“……”The group of venerable sovereigns looked at the sky in silence, feeling helpless.These words ... We don't have the confidence to say that.Are we the Senlan monarch, or are you?……In the air, Yu Ce looked at him coldly, and once again checked the surroundings.Monarch Senlan didn't appear! As for sector Lord Sen LAN, he wouldn't dare to act rashly against them.'Since this fellow doesn't know what's good for him, I'll ... Kill him!'"Die!"In an instant, a soul-stirring power appeared. The power of desire filled the air, full of confusion. In just an instant, the rank 1 Chi felt a little uncomfortable. "Attack!" Li Hao shouted in a low voice.The sound was like a great Bell!Yi was still confused at first, but he suddenly came to his senses. He was shocked and excited. To fight a middle-stage venerable sovereign from an eighth-rank macro world ... How exciting!This group of lunatics, the people from Silver Moon, and the neo martial artists were all crazy.In an instant, all the venerable sovereigns attacked.Yu Ce ignored the others and went straight to Li Hao.However, he didn't pay attention to the others, and he didn't expect that a few weaklings would stop him. Qian Wuliang and the others appeared in an instant, and Yu Ce sneered,""The stage two experts ... Are really bold!"You dare to stop me with just four 2nd rank experts?He shouted in a low voice. The red moon was suspended in the sky and shone brightly. This time, it was almost unconcealed."So what if I'm red Moon sovereign?"BOOM!The battle instantly erupted.Qian Wuliang's side was still fine when the two stage four experts attacked at the same time. Even though they had one less expert, Black Panther, King Huai, Xun RUO, Chan Xiu, and min were no match for them. In just a moment, the weakest venerable sovereign min was killed!With a loud bang, the five venerable sovereigns joined forces and Yi was sent flying in just one move.The difference between Tier 1 and Tier 4 was seriously too great.The Black Panther roared madly and transformed into a giant Beast of Chaos. It tried to swallow the other party, but it was easily repelled. Venerable sovereign limitless snorted coldly. He was merely a rank two, and although he was at the peak of rank two, it was not enough.Out of the five here, three were at the peak of stage two. Chan Xiu was only an ordinary stage two, but she was still not enough.Limitless glanced at Li Hao ... He knew that Li Hao was very strong.Last time, he had killed a stage three expert with a single strike."But last time, there were unexpected factors, and this time there are two 3rd rank experts. After we take care of these guys, we'll take care of this guy. The two 3rd rank experts don't need to kill him, they just need to hold him back for a while.It wasn't too difficult!……The two third level venerable sovereigns were also on high alert.They also knew that this person had killed a colleague before.That was why their goal was to stop them. The woman chuckled. At that moment, countless treasures and beautiful women appeared in front of Li Hao's eyes. Even the origin of the great Dao trembled.The lust in the human heart!The man also mumbled, and his decadent voice echoed. Countless desires for fame and fortune emerged in Li Hao's mind, and he even dreamed of becoming the master of chaos ... Stimulating the desire for fame and fortune in people's hearts.With the two of them working together, even if they were not at the 4th rank, they could still hold off a 4th rank expert.The power of desire of the red moon was extremely strong.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ However, for Li Hao ... It didn't have much of an effect.A quick battle!The longer the delay, the easier it would be for others to see through the truth.At this moment, a ball of fire appeared in Li Hao's mind. A fierce tiger appeared and instantly devoured all desire!At the same time, Li Hao's ferocious Tiger appeared.Countless flames appeared on the firmament sword, burning the entire world.Li Hao's sword slashed down, and the Tiger roared."Roar!"

The roar of the Tiger shook the heavens and earth.The two third stage venerable sovereigns were shocked, but they were not afraid. This sword could not kill them. Just as the two of them were in shock ...Suddenly, within the Dao universe, sector Lord Sen LAN exclaimed,""These two guys ... Are finished!"……In the air, Yan Fang's heart skipped a beat, slightly shaken."A rank seven legacy! This is ... A legacy Dao domain! This is the inheritor of a rank 7 venerable sovereign!"……On the ground.An extremely powerful wandering cultivator's expression changed as he muttered,""The inheritance of a fire-elemental venerable sovereign ... So that's how it is. It has a strong background!"At this moment, something suddenly appeared on Li Hao's sword.It was like a cage!It seemed to come from the Tiger itself, but it also seemed to come from the firmament sword. It seemed to be a Dao domain, a fire-elemental Dao domain!Domain, this was the ability of a rank 7.Although there were some Grade 6 experts who also had it, they were all extraordinary Grade 6 experts.In an instant, with the appearance of the domain, the two third level venerable sovereigns seemed to freeze for a moment. The long sword that was originally unable to kill them was slashed down, and with a crack, the Empress was directly cut in half!The Dao of the Crimson Moon in his body appeared instantly. The long sword shook and a ferocious Tiger appeared. With a bite, the Crimson Moon was shattered!A third level venerable sovereign was killed in an instant under the control of domain!The Tiger swallowed the power of a great Dao. Before it could even swallow the forest great Dao, Li Hao's aura changed. It was as if he had swallowed the power of a great Dao by force. The next moment, he slashed again!"Roar!"The ferocious Tiger roared madly, with a malevolent and crazy look. The man, on the other hand, was now clear-headed, and his expression changed greatly."This is a domain ... Who are you ... A high-level venerable sovereign's inheritor ..."This wasn't li Hao's domain ... It seemed to have emerged from the sword.He didn't come with it!This also meant that this sword should have been the weapon of a rank seven venerable sovereign in the past. Of course, he might not be using it much anymore. This sword seemed to be only a rank four sword!Using a domain on a level three Supreme Emperor was a dimension-lowering attack!Even middle-stage venerable sovereigns would be in trouble.One could imagine what his fate was like.Li Hao slashed out with his sword. With a boom, flames burned the sky. In the blink of an eye, his opponent was burned by the flames. The Tiger reappeared, crushed a Red Moon with its mouth, and devoured it!On the other side, the two venerable sovereigns, Wu Zhao and Yu Ce, were both shocked!"Dao domain!""A fourth-ranked Emperor weapon!"This person actually had the inheritance of a seventh rank venerable sovereign. No wonder he was so strong.In their shock, the two third stage venerable sovereigns were killed. Meanwhile, in the forest orchid world, the other venerable sovereigns heard it and were shocked. This was the weapon of a level Seven venerable sovereign?All of a sudden, countless people revealed greedy expressions.Even the powerful itinerant cultivator had a look of greed in his eyes. However, it quickly disappeared. He frowned slightly. It seemed like ... Monarch Senlan had appeared.However, even with a domain, the two fourth rank venerable sovereigns were still very powerful. This person might not be able to win!While he was thinking, Li Hao killed two venerable sovereigns in the void. His face turned cold."So what if I know? Today ... You will all die!"After he said that, he roared,"fire, fire, fire!" Out of the cage!"In an instant, the flames burned the sky!The power of the great DAOs burned madly. The two rank three venerable sovereigns 'power of the great DAOs were burned to nothing in an instant. The pure power of the great DAOs poured into the Tiger's body.Inside Li Hao's body, the power of fire started to boil!"He's going to advance!"The venerable sovereigns below were all shocked. It was the first time for many of them to see a venerable sovereign about to advance to rank four on the spot. Could this ... Work?At this moment, they were not the only ones.In the realm, several top experts instantly looked over.Tier 3 to Tier 4!Just as everyone was hesitating, a faint sound of the great Dao filled Li Hao's surroundings. Some experts seemed to have vaguely heard something. Some didn't understand, while others 'expressions changed slightly.He couldn't help but curse!艹!Tier 7 legacy!This was the inheritance of a seventh rank venerable sovereign, the inheritance of a fire element venerable sovereign ... The seventh rank fire element venerable sovereign behind the scenes ... Might not be dead, he might still be alive.Otherwise, how could these 10000 DAOs have the opportunity to listen to the sound of the great Dao on the spot? n(0)velbIn[.]nEt All of a sudden, everyone's thoughts changed. So, there might really be a powerful force behind this person. A seventh level venerable sovereign of the fire element ... They quickly thought,"where is the seventh level venerable sovereign of the fire element in this area?"The fire elemental realm existed in all four directions, but ... Was it them?There were two fire elemental realms in the Four Realms. One was the flame world and the other was the Scarlet Sun World. Both realms had Level Seven fire elements. But ... Were they the ones?The Scarlet sun major world was a rank eight force in the Scarlet sun region!At this moment, even sector Lord Sen Lan's expression changed.The flame world was fine, but the Scarlet Sun World ... It would be troublesome. Where did the seventh rank venerable sovereign behind the myriad DAOs sect come from?No wonder he was so arrogant and killed as he pleased. The other party might be the disciple of a realm Lord of a major world!Of course, as for why this person didn't enter the great world ... Perhaps he had some plans.While they were thinking, the Tiger roared crazily, and a fiery sun seemed to appear in the sky. Both Wu Ju and Yu Ce were shocked, and Yu Ce roared,""Stop him!"This guy was actually going to advance!If the other party really did advance, he would be the direct descendant of a rank seven venerable sovereign with a rank four sovereign weapon and a domain. Even if they were venerable sovereigns of a major world, they would find it difficult to fight against him. Moreover, there were so many venerable sovereigns nearby.

Bind also let out a low growl, and the power of desire burned wildly!King Huai and the Black Panther's bodies cracked, and countless desires appeared in their minds. King Huai even revealed some of his true nature, and the greed in his eyes ... Even bind was surprised when he saw this. This person ... Was so greedy!But he didn't have time to be surprised.At this moment, Li Hao's aura suddenly changed, and a majestic fire-type power erupted.In the next moment, a flaming long sword flew straight at bind!"Kill!"Li Hao let out a crazy roar and transformed into a fierce tiger. For the first time in the chaotic universe, he displayed the unique feature of the Silver Moon, the heart fire Tiger, which was unparalleled in strength!The ferocious Tiger's attack, coupled with the Dao of fire and the domain of fire, was extremely powerful. There was also a Grade 4 sovereign weapon!Bind was shocked. He hurriedly summoned the great Dao universe, hoping that the Crimson Moon universe would appear ... But at this moment, the Crimson Moon universe did not appear. Instead, a corner of the forest orchid universe suddenly appeared!Sector Lord Sen Lan's expression was incomparably cold. Summoning the Crimson Moon great Dao cosmos in my world, isn't that just courting death?Red Moon master dared to come to the great path universe ... Then don't blame him for directly falling out with you!Although he was definitely no match for the other party, unless an eighth-rank powerhouse personally attacked, he would not be able to obtain anything if he broke his own world."Damn it!"Bind had not been able to summon the great Dao universe, so he was instantly terrified. Without the support of the great Dao universe, how could he block it? furthermore, at this time, the Black Panther was madly biting him, and King Huai had sneakily attacked him ... He couldn't guard against it!"You dare? I'm ..."Before he could finish his sentence, the surroundings suddenly became extremely quiet. It was as if a barrier had appeared, blocking his voice. This wasn't li Hao's doing, but ... Sector Lord Sen LAN!If he said it was the Crimson Moon, he would be asking for trouble.The other party was shameless, so Sen LAN had to be wary of him. Since that was the case ... It was better to be quiet.At this moment, sector Lord Sen Lan's eyes flickered.This is getting interesting!BOOM!With a loud noise and an explosion, limitless roared but was still cut in half. With a loud boom, a powerful Crimson Moon appeared, but it was broken by Li Hao's attack!Countless Crimson Moon Power directly overflowed in the void."Absorb!" Li Hao shouted in a low voice.BOOM!On the other side, Yu Ce, who was frantically escaping, suddenly felt the aura behind him. At this moment, the two Dao Masters directly absorbed the power of the great Dao and broke some barriers.The two Dao Masters advanced to rank three almost at the same time.The third rank was merely the accumulation of strength.As soon as they entered Tier 3, Empyrean terminus suppressed them for a moment. In the next moment, with a loud boom, his aura erupted and he also entered Tier 3!On the other side, venerable Emperor Xun RUO was also speechless.He was also at Tier 3 back then. When he joined them, he was only at Tier 1 at the beginning. As he integrated into them, the other party advanced to Tier 2, and so did he. He had thought that it would take a long time before he reached Tier 3 ...In the end, how long had it been?BOOM! His aura had also changed. This time, he had also stepped into stage three!All of a sudden, there were four more third level venerable sovereigns, which made the venerable sovereigns below turn pale with shock.Although the third rank was not as good as the middle rank, it was still the peak of the low level venerable sovereign.This group of people ... Were actually at a critical point. They had produced one rank four and four rank three at once. Such a force ... Could even make a living in a middle-level world.Li Hao was overjoyed to see the four stage three venerable sovereigns. His long sword rose into the air and instantly transformed into a fire Dao domain.In an instant, it enveloped the escaping Yu Ce.Yu Ce was shocked. At this moment, he knew that he couldn't call out. If he called out Hong Yue, that sector Lord Sen LAN would definitely stop him. He swiftly transmitted,"You can't kill me. I'm from the red moon. You've killed so many Red Moon venerable sovereigns. You'll definitely attract a rank six venerable sovereign ..."This was the truth!Four venerable sovereigns had died all at once, and there were two middle-stage venerable sovereigns. One had died before, so a total of five venerable sovereigns had fallen. This time, it would be strange if Hong Yue did not come to level six!"I'm alive, I will ..."  n(0)velbIn[.]nEt BOOM!"Kill him!" Li Hao slashed his sword and shouted,"let's kill him together!"All of a sudden, the other venerable sovereigns rushed over.This time, they were much stronger than before. There were many level three venerable sovereigns. Without Li Hao's help, these people were confident of killing him.As the ten venerable sovereigns, including an expert like Li Hao, attacked him ...While the crowd was still in shock, a Red Moon appeared in the sky with a loud boom.The next moment, the moon was shattered by Li Hao's sword!A large amount of great Dao power was infused into the black leopard's body.The Black Panther roared!BOOM!As the power of a great Dao exploded forth, the Black Panther's body swelled, and a stage three aura spread out.The fifth stage three!Of course, although they were shocked, they were not too surprised. This myriad DAOs Supreme Emperor had directly integrated the power of two fourth level venerable sovereigns 'great DAOs into the other venerable sovereigns and reached the third level. This was already a critical point, so it was not surprising at all.However ... One rank four, five rank three, three rank two, and one rank one. Such strength was still extremely terrifying.Yi was also frantically absorbing the power of great DAOs. She was the weakest at the moment, and at this time, she wished she could absorb all the power of great DAOs in one go so that she could also become a second-rank and no longer be the weakest person!Li Hao's long sword swung in the air, and his cold shout reverberated in the world.""The rest of you, quickly retreat. Outsiders can not be arrogant in the orchid Forest! Otherwise, you'll all become ghosts under the ten thousand swords!"“……”Silence!At this moment, many people's faces turned grave.This ... Was too unbelievable.A fourth stage venerable sovereign had been born, and he had a domain and a fourth stage sovereign weapon ... Even among the fourth stage, he was definitely not weak.Once the other party advanced, he would be considered a powerhouse among the 4th rank.The deterrence of a middle-stage venerable sovereign was still very strong.Moreover, this was a madman who was absolutely unrestrained.He had killed so many Red Moon sovereigns ... That was crazy!Not far away, Supreme Emperor Yan Fang also disappeared in an instant. There was a hint of shock in his eyes. There was a rank seven behind this guy ... Sen LAN. This time, she had attracted quite a number of wolves.These ten thousand DAOs had killed venerable sovereign Red Moon so unscrupulously ... Five of the red moon's venerable sovereigns had died. This time, they were in big trouble.He looked into the void, wondering what the realmlord was thinking.The red moon master was probably going to get angry!……In fact, at that moment, a wave of anger spread through the entire Crimson Moon world.Red Moon master was indeed angry.He was already furious that three level Seven venerable sovereigns had been killed by the neo martial artist ... But in the blink of an eye, five venerable sovereigns had died in a broken macro world at his doorstep in just a few days. It was too hateful!In recent days, more than 10 venerable sovereigns had died in Red Moon.The entire Dao universe was much emptier.His eyes were cold as if he had seen something. He shouted in a low voice,"Men, quickly go to Senlan and take the head of the myriad DAOs head! I would also like to see who is standing behind him and giving him such confidence!"'Even if it's a venerable sovereign of the Crimson sun World, if he dares to kill five of my venerable sovereigns right under my nose, these ten thousand DAOs ... Will die without a burial place!'How hateful!This was the first time he was so angry at a non-advanced venerable sovereign.Of course, if the neo martial Swordmaster was not included ... Well, maybe the Silver Moon King was also included. The Silver Moon King did not sense much. Although he killed a few Red Moon emperors, he did not sense much.On the other hand, this bastard Wan Dao dared to kill me, the red moon sovereign, even though he knew I was the one. Who gave him the confidence?

2896 Chapter 477
Four venerable sovereigns again.The forest great world.At this moment, the entire world seemed to have been destroyed.It had only been a few days ... And four more venerable sovereigns had died!Moreover, they were all from the Crimson Moon world.In less than a month, this group of people had killed eight venerable sovereigns. The point was that even the three individual cultivators were actually Hong Yue's external forces. Did this group of people come deliberately to target Hong Yue?In addition ... At this moment, everyone couldn't help but suspect whether these people had come specifically to receive the reward.They were all at a critical point.After the battle, many venerable sovereigns were envious and jealous. Almost everyone in the group had advanced, especially Wan Dao, who had advanced from level three to level four, which was the dream of countless venerable sovereigns!The news was spreading rapidly.There were many cracks in the forest, and the news wasn't sealed. There were many worlds nearby and they weren't far away. At this moment, it wasn't just the Crimson Moon. Several other nearby macro worlds also received the news.Red Moon had entered Senlan's power and was killed by a group of outsiders.He had killed them at an extremely fast speed!Sovereign myriad DAOs was a rank four sovereign with a rank seven inheritance. He also had a rank four sovereign weapon that had the ability of Dao domain. Other than the true inheritance of a high-rank sovereign, it also had domain ... Otherwise, this sovereign myriad DAOs would have no opponents among the rank four.Even if the other party had just advanced!However, the appearance of a domain was enough to make an ordinary rank four dumbfounded. This thing was useless against high-leveled venerable sovereigns, but to them, a domain, unless you were the master of a world or a great Dao, otherwise ... It had absolute suppression!……At this time, Ji Hao, who was the most familiar with Li Hao's group, also had a complicated expression on his face.He had advanced!Fourth rank fire element, seventh rank inheritance, fourth rank Emperor weapon, Dao domain.With this comparison ... Even if he was in his own land, he might not be a match for this person. He had seen the other party go from Tier 3 to Tier 4 with his own eyes, and his mentality was still somewhat complicated.Of course, he was from the sector Lord's bloodline. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  These people had killed venerable Red Moon sovereign ... In fact, he was both afraid and excited.Good kill!Sen LAN didn't really dare to kill Hong Yue and the others. Even if the sector Lord said that it was okay to kill them, but...She still didn't dare.Now, the myriad DAOs Academy was telling everyone that they dared to do so!This was crazy!At that moment, the entire Senlan underwent some changes.The wandering cultivators were already gathered together. At this time, they no longer took the initiative to attack this group of people. Instead, they were all silent. Not only that, some wandering cultivators in the surroundings were also rapidly approaching this side. Not only that, but the expressions of the experts guarding the spatial rifts also changed.Just as the Senlan people were somewhat shaken, the experts from the tianlan, cangjiang, and nethermoon major worlds suddenly gathered into a crack in the surrounding area!These three forces came from great worlds and each had a rank four venerable sovereign.However, after Li Hao killed the two middle-rank fighters, the experts from the three major worlds suddenly began to gather!Originally, the deployment of these macro worlds was almost always a fourth-level and a third-level venerable sovereign. In the blink of an eye, six venerable sovereigns gathered, three of whom were mid-level venerable sovereigns. They were not weak, but they were still extremely vigilant.In another area, a powerful individual cultivator had sent someone to guard it. At this moment, suddenly, an extremely powerful aura descended on the crack, and a white-haired old man appeared directly near the crack.Personally overseeing it!Rank 6 venerable sovereign!This made the wandering cultivators who were waiting there feel at ease. Just now, they were extremely afraid that this group of people would go crazy and kill them directly.But now ... The big boss behind them had come in person.This also meant that ... An itinerant cultivator was an itinerant cultivator after all. Without a strong foundation, he could not gather too many middle-stage venerable sovereigns. He could only come here in person just in case.Li Hao had seized two of the 11 rifts.Sen LAN controlled 5.Now that two more had been abandoned, only two cracks were still under the control of others.Just as many people were still thinking about this, suddenly, the two cracks that had been abandoned gradually began to close. Many people's expressions changed slightly as they looked up at the sky.Nobody!However, silently, the cracks started to close up. This meant that sector Lord Sen LAN had strengthened his control over the realm and was repairing the cracks.When all the cracks were successfully repaired, only the realm gate was left, which also meant that ... The venerable sovereigns could no longer enter and leave as they pleased.They could only go through the realm gate!As for the world gates, they were naturally in the hands of the forest orchid realm Lord.Of the 11 rifts, only 9 remained.A gentle voice suddenly sounded in Li Hao's ears.""Little friend myriad DAOs, do you want me to repair the other crack, or do you want to continue guarding it?"Sector Lord Sen LAN!Li Hao's heart trembled slightly. Sector Lord Sen LAN might have been able to repair some of the cracks long ago, but because there were people in charge and they were from different powers, he didn't want to fall out with them now.Now that the other party had voluntarily given up, he quickly repaired it. This way, he wouldn't offend anyone.He was a cunning old fox!He said that he was going to discuss it with her ... But in reality, if he didn't agree, it would go against Li Hao's character profile ... Although this character profile wasn't too important.The crack was the key for venerable sovereigns to enter the forest world.Without this, going through the realm gate would be truly dangerous.

2897 Chapter 477
"The realmlord can seal it himself, in case it's not perfect enough.""Then I'll use the power of the world to repair it. This time, little friend, you've advanced. It's a cause for celebration. I heard that little friend needs some worlds. Is it to help other fellow Daoists advance to the intermediate stage?"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat, and he said telepathically, I have this idea ... I know that it's easy for them to enter the 3rd tier, but it's very, very difficult for them to enter the 4th tier! If I borrow the power of the world's explosion, there might still be some hope ...""Small world, the chances are very low. Devouring a small world to advance to the intermediate level is very, very rare. Even if there are, they are usually at the critical point!"Sector Lord Sen Lan's voice resounded,"this time, little friend killed two stage four experts. According to our previous agreement, you can exchange for two small worlds and 80 million Dao crystals. However, little friend has reached the 4th stage. Small worlds can't help much. Do you mind directly exchanging them for a medium-level world?"“……”Li Hao was shocked!A medium-level world!The weakest mid-sized world was probably like the Silver Moon. Mid-sized worlds were generally more than ten times the value of small worlds. Saying that they could be exchanged for 100 million great Dao crystals was just empty talk.Medium-level worlds usually had middle-stage venerable sovereigns, and more than one.In the chaos, there were actually many small worlds that were easy to seize.However, in a middle-level world ... He would really have to work hard.Therefore, transactions in middle-level worlds were extremely rare.Sector Lord Sen LAN, was this...To buy him over, or to reward him?Senlan was only a rank six world.It wasn't Grade 7!Even if the other party really did have a mid-tier world, their numbers would probably be frighteningly small.If he killed two 4th rank experts, he should be able to exchange for a middle-level world ... But in reality, it was impossible."Realmlord, is this appropriate?"A medium-sized world might be able to achieve the ten small fish that ermao had hoped for.This was the first reason. The second reason was that the structure of the great Dao of a medium world and the structure of a world ... Apart from having some understanding of the Silver Moon, Li Hao had a small world, but he did not have a medium world.Third, the cat only ate the world origin, but the world itself did not need it. As a world Lord, if the Black Panther devoured a mid-tier world ... It would be a form of improvement for Silver Moon!"What's inappropriate about it?"Sector Lord Sen Lan's voice rang out once more,"I think it's pretty good. Only a mid-tier world can be of some help to little friend." "This medium-level world isn't too strong. In the past, it was guarded by a rank four venerable sovereign. Later, he fought against me and was defeated by me ... Although this world doesn't have a great Dao universe, the power of the Dao laws of this medium-level world is very strong. After this world was defeated, we didn't plunder too much ... The world power is very rich. Young friend, you can refine it or directly devour it!"If he refined it and moved some people in, he could even become a medium-level world Lord!Becoming a sector Lord was also a form of improvement.As such, there were very few transactions in middle-level worlds, as the world Energy was very dense. Under normal circumstances, even a Stage 5 would find it difficult to break through a middle-level world guarded by a stage 4."Then ... Thank you for your help, realm Lord!""You're welcome!"Sector Lord Sen Lan's voice rang out in his ears but he didn't appear in person. At this moment, he continued,"In addition, you also know the origin of this group of people, so it's not convenient for me to show my face directly. Otherwise, I would have killed them long ago! Of course, it was also because of this that the other party would not let this matter rest! As expected, there will definitely be a Grade 6 expert entering the realm this time!""I, Senlan, currently only have one other rank 6 expert ... It's not convenient for me to make a move, and it's not convenient for me to show up and deter them! Senior Yan Fang can threaten a Grade 6, but there's more than one in the realm!""If the other Scarlet Moon rank-6s see an opportunity in the process of intimidating the Scarlet Moon rank-6s, it will be very troublesome!",m Li Hao's heart moved when he heard this.Did this mean that if a sixth-rank Crimson Moon came, Senlan's sixth-rank would not care? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  If that was the case...This forest orchid sector Lord didn't have much of a structure.It's no wonder that Li Hao thinks so ... Hong Yue and the others came to seize the Dao universe, not your friend. At this moment, I've helped you get rid of Hong Yue's people. Other than the middle-level worlds, this person doesn't seem to have provided any help.In that case, I can only take it on myself?Just as he was thinking about it, the voice of sector Lord Sen LAN rose up,"A sixth rank venerable sovereign is much stronger than a fourth rank venerable sovereign. Even three or four fourth rank venerable sovereigns can't defeat a sixth rank venerable sovereign!"It was not difficult for a Tier 6 to fight two tier 5 players, and it was not difficult for a Tier 5 player to fight two tier 4 players ...This was only the difference between middle-stage venerable sovereigns.When it came to the advanced level ... It was completely different.It was normal for a normal sixth-rank to be killed by a seventh-rank in one move.The moment his Dao domain was activated, he was immediately suppressed!Rank seven was a huge transformation.It was difficult to win against a sixth-rank combatant with four or five fourth-rank combatants. This also depended on whether the sixth-rank combatant was useless or not. For example, it was normal for ten fourth-rank combatants to be killed when they attacked together.While Li Hao was still thinking, sector Lord Sen Lan's voice sounded,""Senlan, it's not good to deal with them directly ... Of course, at the critical moment, if we really have no choice, we will also resist! But now, since we haven't shed all pretenses of cordiality, we don't want to attract too many venerable sovereigns. We might have to trouble you to stand at the front and resist them ... You may not care about the price, but your subordinates may be looking for an opportunity ..."

Chapter 2898 Spoils Of War (3)
"The forest orchid Dao master has fallen. The forest orchid realm has a chance to advance to Level Seven. In order to fight against the Crimson Moon experts, these fellow Daoists can all enter the forest orchid realm ... Even if a peak level rank six is dead, it can still accommodate a few more venerable sovereigns!"Li Hao's heart moved.Was this a recruitment or another test?He entered the great Dao universe!This was a good thing. Furthermore, if he could really enter Level Seven ... All the venerable sovereigns in the entire Dao universe would benefit.However, Qian Wuliang and the others all had some problems.In fact, it was not easy to integrate into the great Dao universe!If it wasn't well hidden, it would be easily exposed.Li Hao's mind was filled with many thoughts. What sector Lord Sen LAN meant was ... He wouldn't directly help them deal with the Crimson Moon, but he could recruit a group of people and enter the great Dao universe. With the advantage of being a native, they might have a higher chance of resisting.Or perhaps ... If Li Hao was really killed, those who entered the Dao universe would naturally become Senlan's venerable sovereigns. Moreover, after entering the Dao universe, there would be almost no way out.He could only be of the same mind as Senlan.Li Hao kept thinking and judging. Soon, he said,""Realmlord, how many people can it hold?" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At this moment, sector Lord Sen Lan's heart was also moved.This person ... Was really willing?After all, once they entered the Dao universe, the other party would no longer listen to them ... Of course, this was not absolute. However, once they broke free of the restrictions and became venerable sovereigns of the Dao universe, the myriad DAOs would no longer have any suppression and deterrence over these people.Even if they were originally his subordinates, the other party might just ignore them."Currently, it can only accommodate three to five ... Any more will probably have to wait until the great Dao universe advances. At that time, it can accommodate dozens more venerable sovereigns ...""Realm Lord, can I consider it and discuss it with them?""Of course, anytime! In addition, Hong Yue is not far from us. If she is a sixth rank venerable sovereign, she can reach Senlan in about three days. "Three days was a very fast speed.And this was still the sixth step!If it was the seventh rank, it might take a day.As for level eight ... It might only take a short while.It could be seen how close these guys were to the Crimson Moon, and they were not afraid of being broken through by the Crimson Moon.Of course, they had come to form an alliance, so they had to get closer. Otherwise, it would be meaningless. If the rank eight Red Moon Lord took a long time to arrive, then a strategic alliance would be meaningless."I understand, thank you realmlord for your help!""That's what I should do ... In addition, if a Crimson Moon expert arrives and little friend feels that it's dangerous, there's no need to fight him directly. You can just hide in Senlan ... If the other party dares to act unscrupulously in Senlan, I'll personally take action when necessary!"His last words were somewhat bold.Of course, he didn't know if it was true or not. However, after thinking about it ... It wasn't necessarily a lie. If the other party went too far, it would be normal for this Senlan to act. The premise was ... That the other party might be in the middle of advancing. Otherwise, it would be a big problem if the remaining Level Seven and level eight of the red moon were to be attracted.Sector Lord Sen Lan's will quickly retreated.At this moment, the crack that Li Hao had occupied earlier was quickly being repaired.Out of the 11 rifts, three were gone in the blink of an eye.Out of the remaining eight rifts, Sen LAN had already suppressed five. In an instant, the expressions of some of the Rogue cultivators in the boundary changed. Once all the rifts were closed, it would be very troublesome. At this time, these rogue cultivators hesitated for a moment. Under the lead of the two rank 4s, they headed straight in the direction of the other rank 6 rogue cultivator.Although Li Hao's side was weak, these people were worried that they would be attacked by Li Hao and Supreme Emperor Senlan, so they didn't dare to get close.Now, it was safer to go to the wandering cultivators 'side.……The world was silent.Li Hao didn't say anything, either. They were all comprehending and digesting what they had learned.After killing several venerable sovereigns, many people entered the third rank in an instant.As for Hong Yue, it was hard to say whether there would be a rank six or more coming. Moreover, there would definitely be a rank six coming in person. Also, there might be some venerable sovereigns hidden in this realm, or some rogue cultivators who were supported by her.This was normal. To take over a great world, the Crimson Moon might even have Stage 6 experts hidden in the dark ...... However, right now, their opponent was only Li Hao. They couldn't reveal themselves so easily. They had to wait for sector Lord Sen LAN to make a move before they would be exposed.Were there no tier 6 experts in the entire forest orchid?Definitely!But now, other than that rogue cultivator, no one else appeared. Their target wasn't li Hao but the Sen LAN realm Lord. Before the Sen LAN realm Lord appeared, these people wouldn't easily reveal themselves. For example, Sword Saint and Kong Ji.They didn't appear either.On the surface, there were only a few Grade 4 experts here, but in reality, it was impossible for that to happen.If that was the case, Senlan would have destroyed them long ago.At this moment, Li Hao looked around and saw that Lin Hongyu was still in seclusion. Apart from him, five of the nine venerable sovereigns had advanced to rank three.Xun RUO and celestial pole's original bodies had long since reached rank three, so they didn't advance.In fact, only Heibao, Qian Wuliang, and Hong Yitang had advanced to the next level.King Huai, Chan Xiu, and the celestial pole clone were all at stage two, while Yi was still at stage one.The forest great Dao universe ...Li Hao's mind kept on spinning as he pondered.Today, it was just a small fight. Before Supreme Emperor Senlan made a move, it was just an appetizer.He considered for a moment and suddenly transmitted a message, is there anyone willing to join the Senlan cosmos?

2899 Chapter 477
Everyone immediately opened their eyes and looked at Li Hao.Join Senlan?Li Hao had mentioned this before, but could he disguise himself now?Li Hao said,"not a disguise, but a direct entry!" If Senlan can advance to the seventh step, she might be able to help you complete your advancement!"Everyone was shocked again."Huai King, you've already cleansed yourself once and removed the aura of the origin ... Your Dao is not too close to neo martial ... If you integrate it, once Senlan steps into tier 7, you'll definitely be able to enter Tier 3!"King Huai wanted to say something, but he hesitated.Li Hao continued,"my idea is that King Huai, Chan Xiu, and Yan, since none of you are level-three, you can give it a try. Entering the forest great Dao universe might be an opportunity!" As for the others, they're all at rank three, but senior celestial pole's clone doesn't matter ... This way, as long as Sen LAN can successfully advance, you'll have made a big profit!" "This is also a chance!""From level six to Level Seven, the origin of the great Dao is revealed. The entire great Dao universe seems to absorb countless chaotic power and quickly convert it into the power of the great Dao. It's difficult to go from low to middle level, but it's not difficult to advance one or two levels from low level."As soon as he said this, King Huai couldn't help but transmit his voice,"In that case, we'll be under the control of the master of the great Dao!"Li Hao had said this for two reasons. First, the other party had to advance.Second, the master of the great Dao would not control them."It's fine!"Li Hao sent a voice transmission, he wants to control you, not you! We're just borrowing the chicken to lay eggs! Of course, to him, it didn't matter even if all of them had entered the 3rd rank! A third rank venerable sovereign is nothing. " Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  "In addition ... I think it's possible that he can really reach Level Seven!"The few of them were surprised to hear this.Why did he say that?It was still very difficult to advance from level six to Level Seven. Even if the other party had a Dao universe, the Dao universe had been damaged previously, and there were still a bunch of them in the entire forest orchid crack. The outside world was also eyeing them covetously ... Could he really advance to Level Seven?King Huai thought for a moment before replying,"King means that this forest orchid sector Lord is still in hiding?" In fact, you're confident that you can advance?"Perhaps, it was to plan for more things."I'm just guessing ... I'm guessing that this person is attracting more Tier 6 cultivators! "Perhaps, in order to kill them directly and allow the Dao universe to advance more easily, three of the 11 cracks in Senlan have been eliminated today. However, the five cracks that Supreme Emperor Senlan is in charge of have not moved at all ... Can't be eliminated, or is he deliberately showing his weak state?""At this moment, he gives off the feeling that he's recovering, and he's recovering very quickly ... But he hasn't recovered to his peak, and it's difficult for him to enter the seventh tier ..." Li Hao pondered for a while and said,"however, he knew that I might have a seventh rank venerable sovereign behind me. He didn't ask or mention it. Instead, he asked me to stay in Senlan and didn't let me leave. He didn't do anything to me either ... In fact, he just hoped that I would attract more experts here."The forest orchid sector Lord had even given him a middle level world.Although killing two 4th rank experts could indeed be exchanged ... Giving you two small worlds and a medium-level world were different.The latter could really improve Li Hao's strength.The former was of little use to Li Hao.The other party seemed to hope that Li Hao could improve and even refine this world. He even hoped that Li Hao could face a stage six by himself and attract more powerhouses to besiege him.In reality, what Senlan needed at this time was peace.Although Li Hao was helping Sen LAN by killing a large number of venerable sovereigns, his methods were too aggressive. If Sen LAN wanted to endure it, she should have stopped Li Hao.Even kidnapping Li Hao and giving him to Red Moon could buy him some time.One thought after another appeared in Li Hao's mind. From this, he had some conjecture...That sector Lord Sen LAN definitely had some scheme. It was possible that he wanted to kill more experts and break through to Level 7 in one go!Stabilize the realm!He continued to talk about what had happened before,'if the three of you join Senlan, when the other party advances, the three of you will also advance! As for your DAOs, they aren't that special. Chan Xiu and Yan are rogue cultivators to begin with, so as long as they leave this long river, they won't cause any trouble ..."King Huai thought to himself,'if we leave, will we still have the chance to return to the Silver Moon universe?It wasn't easy for him to harden his heart and join in.If they left ... Li Hao would just say 'you guys should stay in Senlan'... Wouldn't that be a huge loss?What was Senlan?If he wanted to, wouldn't it be better for him to stay in new martial arts?As for Chan Xiu and Yan, the two unaffiliated cultivators, they were also nervous. On the one hand, they were eager to advance, but on the other hand, they were uneasy. Was Li Hao telling them the truth, or was he just testing them?They had been forcibly recruited by Li Hao. If ... They joined Senlan, wouldn't li Hao be worried that they would betray him?Even if they didn't betray Li Hao ... Once Li Hao's identity was exposed, he would run away. If the two of them stayed, Senlan and new martial arts would be enemies. Once Li Hao's identity was exposed, wouldn't they be finished?"Everyone, don't forget that we're all just wandering cultivators now!"Li Hao suddenly said,"rogue cultivators, it's normal to rely on anyone. Even if my identity is exposed, you guys only need to say that if you don't know my identity ... I've already entered Senlan. Would sector Lord Senlan still kill you?" "That's the first. Second, if it's really necessary, you can give up your power and leave directly. Your comprehension of the Dao art is still there, but it doesn't mean that there's too much energy. If you leave at the seventh-rank, I can't help you recover. However, you're only at the lower-rank, so it's easy to recover energy!
