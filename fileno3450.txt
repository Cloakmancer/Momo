The human King's evaluation was that Li Hao was heartless.Li Hao didn't think so.Of course, the person who was the most difficult to see clearly was himself. Li Hao just felt that ... Although the world was big, it didn't necessarily mean that one had to stay in one place. The four Seas were home. Where couldn't he go and where couldn't he stay?So what if they dominated the East and the chaos?Silver Moon had always been by his side. Was this considered heartless?Of course, even if silver Moon did not stay by his side, it did not matter as long as he was safe. Li Hao was reluctant to part with Silver Moon, but he was not too reluctant either. All good things must come to an end. It was just that Silver Moon did not have the ability to protect himself in the face of the world's injustice.

Why did they have to stay?The human King had bound himself.Of course, the human King was arrogant the moment he left home and was almost beaten to death ... It was understandable for him to go back and find some comfort. His teachers, friends, lovers, and relatives could all give him some comfort.Be it the martial King, revered sword, or human King, they could all comfort the human King. Emperor Cang could do it as well.But Silvermoon ... If I were to lose, who would be able to comfort me?There's no one in Silver Moon who can offer me any comfort.The teacher couldn't take it either.The East was in chaos!On the way to the Alliance City of the middle world, Li Hao traveled between the sky and the earth. He discovered countless worlds that were migrating. Those with chaos beasts were riding on them to move the worlds. Those without chaos beasts were also being pulled by experts with all their might and migrating.The originally scattered worlds were now gathering.Some Grade 7 and even grade 8 worlds started to seek self-protection.The East was in chaos!In fact, it was even more chaotic and terrifying than the other three forces. In a short period of time, too many rank eight venerable sovereigns had died. Now, all of reincarnation had run away. Reincarnation, Sun Moon, earth splitting, Heluo, and Gemini were all gone.Among them, Samsara, Gemini, and sun Moon had more than one rank eight venerable sovereign. They were ranked high.Now, there were 15 level 8 venerable sovereigns in the remaining 11 level 8 great worlds.These were all the known level 8 ones in the East.The first place had officially become the extreme Ice world, with three level 8s ... Of course, the premise was that the two Extreme Ice emperors who had gone to the four-sided domain could return safely.On new martial's side, there were human King, Emperor Cang, light, and Supreme. In addition to this time, there were bound to be some tier 7 advancement. It was only natural for them to become the number one force in the East.It was ridiculous that they had become the number one force in the East after leaving the four-square region for a few days.Moreover, the enemy had taken down the Heluo and sun Moon macro worlds. Even if there were no new type 8, there would be many Type 7 ones.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ As for Li Hao, he had also gained a lot this time.After killing four rank eight venerable sovereigns, Fu Sheng self-destructed, but the remaining three were killed. Their power of great DAOs was almost all still present. On the other hand, er Mao received a gift from big cat, the earth-splitting world.Also, the book of Dao given by a Supreme martial artist should not be the original, but it must be a powerful replica.Other than that, there was the most crucial point, rule force.Yes, the rule force from the future.Even if it was just a tiny bit, it was enough.To Li Hao, this was a brand new power. Of course, it should still exist now, but he might be able to gain some insights from it on how to turn this power of disorder into order. In this battle, everyone was injured. However, to experts, injuries were not a big problem if they did not die.His teacher had almost been killed by Fu Sheng, but he was still full of energy.The human King had been beaten to a pulp by several level 8s, but it seemed that he would recover soon. Li Hao had used a lot of time power, and the Thunder tribulation was no longer a threat. However, too much time had consumed his lifespan, and it was not worth it.Now, Li Hao also had some enlightenment.Time was a Dao, a unique Dao. Time was a very powerful Dao, so why did it consume so much longevity every time it was used ...? The only explanation was that this Dao of time was not created by him, and did not completely belong to him. That was why he had to pay such a huge price.If it was his own time, it shouldn't be like this.Otherwise, how could one's own cultivation of time consume one's lifespan by one's own Dao?Moreover, time was related to one's lifespan, so how could it be used up so easily?The sudden encounter this time made Li Hao reflect on himself.Although he had entered the 7th rank, he was not considered too strong among the 7th rank without time. He could only say that he was the number one figure among the 7th rank, but he was definitely not invincible!It wasn't that he didn't have a trump card. The calamity sword was already very powerful. However, no matter how powerful the trump card was, it couldn't kill a rank eight venerable sovereign with one strike while he had the power of a thousand worlds. That didn't make sense."Your peak explosive power is far inferior to that of a rank eight. Even if you combine 10000 DAOs into one, you can't kill your opponent with one strike. No matter what trump card you have, it's useless.At this time, what he lacked was strength!And not the technique!"Also ... In the future, the person who will use the power of laws ..."Thinking of the future person, Li Hao fell into deep thought. Was he from the false chaos that he had not constructed?The other party was able to cultivate rule force. Did it mean that rule force was born when he was constructing chaos?He also said that he had left some trouble for him ... What trouble?Was that person at the seventh or eighth rank?

Chapter 3451 The King Of Myriad DAOs (2)
From the fact that he had forced Fu Sheng back with a single strike, it seemed to have the power of an eighth-rank magical beast. However, it might not be an eighth-rank magical beast.Because of the time and space, Li Hao could not make a clear judgment.In that case, would the future pseudo-chaos be able to reach Level Seven or eight?It was a little unbelievable.Was this person a natural life form in the future, or was he born from these people when he wanted to teleport some people over?How should he solve the problem of the pseudo-chaos source of life?This time, seeing that person made Li Hao more determined. I can succeed. As for how I can succeed, I don't know yet, but I can definitely do it ... Now, the key is how to give life to this false chaos?Using time?Many thoughts filled Li Hao's mind.At this moment, the people around him were also silent, and no one disturbed Li Hao. Soon, Li Hao came to a realization.Looking at the people around him, he thought for a moment and said,"This time, I've obtained three rank eight corpses and a rank eight world ... Senior second cat's world was given to me by big cat, so it should belong to second cat ..."Second cat rolled his eyes. Logically? so you're not going to be reasonable now?Yes, it was.Li Hao didn't want to argue with logic anymore. He smiled and said,""Second cat just materialized in reality not long ago. Even if it swallowed a rank eight world, it wouldn't reach rank eight. It's not that simple, so it's a waste to eat it now ... I'll borrow it for a while. What do you think, senior second cat?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùSecond cat was speechless. After a while, he said,"As you wish!"This guy!"Not just this world," Li Hao said with a smile."I'm also going to take away the three corpses ... This time, I want to officially promote Silver Moon to the seventh step!"No one had any objections.Now that Silver Moon had officially broken through to the seventh rank, they would have two more seventh rank venerable sovereigns on their side, and they would be real Geminis that could even fuse together. It was not like a world had given birth to two seventh rank venerable sovereigns.However, at this moment, Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang's expressions changed. Hong Yitang took the initiative to speak."Silver Moon wants to reach the seventh rank. For now, he lacks energy. For another, Qian Wuliang and I don't have much comprehension of the seventh rank."This was probably the first time he had taken the initiative to reject Li Hao. Instead of remaining silent, he rejected Li Hao's suggestion and said,""My idea is that even though old demon Yuan constructed a Dao domain, he doesn't lack energy. This time, I suggest that we satisfy his needs first and allow his Dao domain to expand so that he can advance to the seventh rank!"Li Hao looked at him, and Hong Yitang said seriously,""The Silver Moon has devoured a lot of energy, so it doesn't lack that much energy. The key is that Qian Wuliang and I don't have the real power to construct our Dao domains. To be honest, it won't be very useful to force our way to rank seven!""On the other hand, Yuan Shuo can advance to the seventh step!"As he said this, he looked around and took the initiative to say,""The remaining energy can help all the low level venerable sovereigns enter the third level! Let the middle-stage venerable sovereigns enter the sixth stage! These two stages were the process of energy accumulation. "We should learn new martial arts and accumulate a large number of powerhouses at a stage first. As long as the opportunity is right, everyone has the opportunity to cross levels. New martial arts has no shortage of people who can advance to tier 7. What it lacks is just an opportunity ..." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "The remaining ones should be given to you first. They should be used to help you construct the myriad Dao Pavilion and to fill up some of the little realms that you have created ..."He was very serious and once again brought up the problem of his own comprehension."Qian Wuliang and I have advanced too fast. We need to stabilize our cultivation at Level Seven, but Yuan Shuo doesn't because he has been doing so all the time. He is more talented than us ... I don't mind if you force us to advance just to have two more Level Seven venerable sovereigns, but it doesn't mean much!"At this moment, Qian Wuliang also said,""I spent a hundred years in the Li realm ..."Li Hao was stunned. Only a hundred years?It wasn't too long.From the looks of it, sealing off the rank 6 world this time was not as effective as he had expected. It was a pity that he had broken it early. If he wanted to seal it again, he would have to pay an even greater price.She wanted to hear what he had to say.Qian Wuliang continued,"in the past 100 years, I've followed the Marquis's instructions and made some realizations. I've integrated into the local area and gained a lot." However, it's also because of this that I know that if I want to enter rank 7, just as brother Hong said, I still need some accumulation ... This time, I also support brother Hong's opinion ..."Hong Yitang glanced at him. In the past, this fellow had addressed him as Dean Hong and senior Hong ... But this time, it was brother Hong.Qian Wuliang had changed a little in the 100 years of the Li Dynasty.Qian Wuliang didn't even feel it.Compared to before, there was also a little less ... Lecherous aura?This was a little interesting. It seemed that he had gained quite a lot.At this moment, Wu Shan also spoke up,"I also think that this is not bad!" Fellow Daoist Yuan Shuo has constructed his own Dao domain, so there's a high chance that he'll be able to reach Level Seven! You also need to perfect your little realm. Ever since you leveled up in the Dragon field, you haven't been able to perfect it. This time, you can perfect it a little more. It would be best if silver Moon could advance naturally!"He rarely interfered with Li Hao's arrangements.However, this time, he also felt that forcefully upgrading Silver Moon would be meaningless. It would be better to let Yuan Shuo, who could advance, do so and strengthen Li Hao himself. Li Hao's current strength was very strong, but with a bunch of tier 8 powerhouses dead, he was not that strong anymore.

Chapter 3452 The King Of Myriad DAOs (3)
This time, Li Hao had a conversation with the neo martial artist human King. The human King and Supreme-being there were all level eight. Li Hao was very young and their junior, but in Wu Shan's eyes, he was the core and soul of his side.However, their strength was a huge gap. This was not acceptable!A conversation required equal strength.But now, their strength was not equal.Li Hao was slightly stunned. He was used to arranging some people. In the beginning, he would ask for everyone's opinions, but later, he gradually got used to making his own decisions, mainly because no one objected to his opinions.It had been a long time, and he was already used to it.At this moment, Hong Yitang, who had never opposed him, was the first one to object. Even Qian Wuliang, who had always been obedient, felt that Hong Yitang's words were reasonable. Li Hao fell into deep thought.After a moment, he smiled and nodded.""That's reasonable ... We should adopt some of everyone's opinions. The reason why everyone can gather together is to keep each other warm. It's safer and freer ... Everyone thinks so. Perhaps I'm overthinking it."Qian Wuliang coughed and said,""It's not that we object to Lord Marquis. We also wish to become stronger, but ...""Understood!"Li Hao laughed."You've settled down for a hundred years. You don't have to be so careful with your words. If you can reach Level Seven on your own ... You'll be even more extraordinary."Qian Wuliang felt embarrassed and stopped talking.Li Hao thought for a moment, then looked at the teacher beside him. Seeing him look over, Yuan Shuo didn't feel embarrassed and nodded."I think so too. I'll be given priority to enter the seventh rank. Don't worry, consider it a loan. I'll return it sooner or later!"..."You're really not polite!"Li Hao was speechless.Yuan Shuo was also speechless."I was sent flying by a slap and almost died. Why should I be polite?"What's there to be polite about!I'll pay you back when I earn more money. At the moment, he also feels that he has the highest chance of reaching the seventh step.There was no need to be polite.If you can't afford it ... You'll pay it back! Yes, raising a son to prevent old age was the same as raising a disciple.Although this disciple of his was now powerful and powerful, wasn't the purpose of taking in a disciple so that he could have someone to rely on when he was old?Even though this guy didn't really rely on himself.He and Li Hao had never been polite. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Hehe!" Li Hao chuckled and could only nod."Let's do that!"‚Äã After that, he said,"I don't care what neo martial does. If the other party needs it, I will help. Of course, I don't care what arrangements you make. If you are interested, you can participate. I won't stop you." Next, I'll put more energy into the structure of the myriad Dao illusionary realm. If the middle world Alliance is not willing to cooperate, now is a good time, we can do it ourselves!"After saying that, he continued,"also, Samsara has run away. The other three overlords will probably know what happened in the East very soon. There's still long Zhan who's watching covetously. In fact, the situation in the East isn't as good as we thought. Right now, there are wolves in the front and tigers behind ... But if the other parties want to attack the East, they won't make a decision so quickly. So, there will be a short period of peace ..."After saying that, Li Hao looked at the crowd and said after some thought,""We don't know anything about the other three forces. I have an idea. We might need some people to travel alone to collect some information and understand the other forces."After he said that, he hesitated for a moment before he continued,"Also, take some of the ethereal Plane away and construct a path in the river of time. Of course, it's only for positioning. At present, there are still experts who can sense the existence of time! "That's why we'll activate the river of time when we need it. That way, we'll be able to construct the fastest and most convenient communication and teleportation system in the entire chaos ... We'll be able to prepare for the worst. I think that the other three factions will also treat us as enemies!"Yes, this time, Li Hao had some ideas.It was all because of this sudden battle!No one knew beforehand that Samsara had sought refuge with huntian and suddenly appeared with a large number of rank eights, catching everyone off guard. Even the Supreme neo martial artist was caught off guard.The other party had made some arrangements. However, Li Hao's group seemed to be taking one step at a time without making any arrangements.If the target this time was him, it might be terrible!As soon as he said that, everyone looked at each other and fell into deep thought.Li Hao continued,"if these people are from Silver Moon, they need to leave the great Dao universe and walk independently!" Otherwise, his identity would be easily exposed. "Moreover, with the power of an intermediate and intermediate venerable sovereign, there's not much guarantee of safety when traveling. If you carry the Mirage with you, it's easy to expose your identity. Of course, that'll only happen if you encounter a top-notch expert ..."Li Hao looked around. At this moment, someone took the initiative to speak, but unexpectedly, it was not the sensible fellows like Redwood.Instead, it was Southern Fist, which usually liked to do the opposite. At this moment, Southern Fist was still at the peak of the third rank, but he should be close to the fourth rank. Li Hao took a look and found that he was almost there.At this moment, Nan Quan said,"let's go together!" "It's actually useless to stay in Silver Moon or the Li Dynasty. We're already venerable sovereigns, but we're still cooped up here all day. This time, we can't even stop a tier eight even if we join forces ... He's too useless! Everyone, let's go out for a walk! Last time, I went to Tian Fang, but it was only for a short time. I didn't see many experts, what a pity!"

Chapter 3453 The King Of Myriad DAOs (3)
"Since Silver Moon won't be able to reach tier 7 any time soon, there's not much use for us to stay!"Nan Quan laughed and said,""Let's spread them out. Just like silver Moon province, we martial masters went our separate ways. At critical moments, we could still be of some use. Now that we're working together, we can't even deal with a level eight ... We might as well be of some use.""Let's leave the opportunity to become venerable sovereigns to the younger generation!"After becoming a venerable sovereign, they occupied the spots of the venerable sovereigns in the great path universe. Now, there were many Dao integration realm juniors, but unfortunately, the spots were full, and it was difficult to give birth to new venerable sovereigns.Unless Silvermoon could reach the seventh step.There were only so many venerable sovereigns in the great path universe who had not entered Level Seven.At this moment, the Thunder monarch suddenly said,"some of the venerable sovereigns of our Thunder World ... Have also been tested. Fellow Daoist Li Hao saw it last time. Those who were not determined had all withdrawn. Those who stayed were all brothers that we could trust. Now, since we have nothing to do ... In that case, why don't we let some of our brothers in the Thunder World go out as well? after all, the great Dao universe is gone!""It's the same for my Senlan realm," monarch Senlan added."Of course, there aren't many people I can trust, but don't worry. I'll pick some trustworthy and trustworthy venerable sovereigns to go out!"They all looked at Li Hao. Since they were going to send someone out, their own people could do it too.Now, it would be a waste to stay.Moreover, those venerable sovereigns were not very comfortable and free. When they encountered danger, they had to hide.It would be better to send him out to make a living!Anyway, the outer area was very large and there were many itinerant cultivators. The addition of a group of venerable sovereigns would not attract anyone's attention at all if they were scattered all over the place.Those who could reach the level of venerable sovereigns were not really idiots.In Li Hao's mind, he was thinking about new martial arts. In fact, many venerable sovereigns were not in new martial arts and were likely to have gone out. Perhaps the Supreme sovereigns had some arrangements. Not only new martial arts, but the Dragon Master had also scattered many weaker venerable sovereigns.Of course, the chaos race was more conspicuous, mainly because they had incorporated some human venerable sovereigns.The huntian Overlord had also planted a large number of people in the East. Although he had no intention of fighting for hegemony, he had to admit that if he did not make any preparations, he would be swallowed up sooner or later!Li Hao was more alert after this unexpected encounter.A Tiger doesn't hurt people, but people hurt the Heart of a Tiger.At this stage, peace can't be achieved just because you say you want it. Best novel online free at‚Äã …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ Li Hao nodded slightly."Let's go to the Alliance City of the middle world first. We'll have a good discussion. We'll make specific arrangements after we've made the necessary arrangements and digested the gains this time!"No one said anything more and flew toward Alliance City number 9.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Alliance City nine.At that moment, the city Lord, Emperor Wan Qiu, had a complicated feeling. At this moment, she was both shocked and scared.What was there to be afraid of? He was afraid that Samsara would know something.She was the one who had informed Li Hao about the human King's siege. In fact, Li Hao and the others had no idea that a battle had broken out. In the end, even Supreme Emperor Wanqiu had not expected that four level 8s and a group of Level 7s would die.If the reincarnation Emperor knew about this, would he let her go?Not to mention her, the entire world Alliance would be in trouble!This time, if she hadn't revealed the news, to be honest, the human King might have really suffered a big loss.However, she had not expected it to be so serious!They also didn't expect that Li Hao's group had actually killed so many rank eights. They also didn't expect that the Samsara society had joined chaos heaven and gathered eight rank eights. If this was known, not only Samsara, but chaos heaven world would also destroy their Central World Alliance.However, since things had come to this, Wanqiu could only hope that ... The news would not be leaked.Li Hao and the others discovered it themselves, not me.Otherwise, he would really be finished.Not to mention that he was only at the sixth step, even if he reached the eighth step, he would not be able to withstand the revenge from all sides.Panic!Even though the battle had stopped, she was still terrified. It was not just her. Some of the core members of the entire middle world Alliance were also terrified because they ... Knew something.He also knew that the news might have been leaked from his side.This was because the news had been spread from them. Soon, Supreme Emperor Wanqiu had sent out some information that only the higher-ups knew about. She was looking for Supreme Emperor myriad transformations and the Silver Moon King to cooperate.As for the Silver Moon King ... He went to kill the reincarnation Emperor and the others not long after. If Wanqiu didn't tell them this, they wouldn't have believed it!Most importantly, it was not a problem that could be solved by selling Wanqiu.It was the communication system of the entire middle world Alliance that had a huge impact on some major worlds. In the past, the major worlds might not have cared, but once the news was leaked, those major worlds and Overlord forces who did not care might even destroy all the middle Worlds!I told you to communicate with the inside and outside!If they could sell Wanqiu in exchange for peace, they would not mind doing so. However, it was not feasible. Hence, at this moment, all the core members of the middle world Alliance were terrified and anxious.It was very troublesome!Li Hao's side was in trouble, neo martial arts was in trouble, Samsara was in trouble ...Of course, now that Samsara had run away, there wouldn't be too much trouble for the time being.Just as she was feeling melancholic, her expression changed slightly. In the next moment, she regained her respect."Wanqiu congratulates the seniors ... For winning!"No matter what they were thinking, this group of people was the winner!Since that was the case ... They were the overlords of the East. The middle world Alliance was strong, but no matter how strong they were, they couldn't fight against this group of people. They could only bow their heads and lower their brows. Previously, Samsara had been fighting against them.

Chapter 3454 The King Of Myriad DAOs (3)
Now that Samsara had run away, could the extreme Ice realm and the other realms fight against these cruel people?Difficult!Although there were still many level 8 worlds, 11 level 8 worlds, and 15 level 8 venerable sovereigns, so what if there were 15 level 8 worlds?Could they be United?Could they all rise up to resist?There were quite a number of level eight venerable sovereigns in the group of new martial and silver Moon."You're welcome. I have to thank Daoist Wanqiu for the information."Li Hao appeared with a group of people, smiling.""If you didn't tell me, I wouldn't have known that the human King was surrounded! He also didn't expect that a total of eight eighth level venerable sovereigns would be dispatched. This was really unexpected and he almost fell. Fortunately, the heavens have blessed us ..."God bless?What nonsense is this!You guys were too ruthless!Thearch Wanqiu was speechless, but she quickly found a topic to talk about.""Senior, elder myriad transformations has responded to the Alliance. He'll be here soon to discuss some cooperation with you. Not only elder myriad transformations, but there are also several other core elders in the Alliance ..."In fact, the news had just been sent back.It wasn't clear whether myriad transformations Supreme Emperor had received the news before this. However, after Samsara escaped and Li Hao killed those rank eight Supreme emperors, this myriad transformations elder, who was usually elusive, gave a response.It would be here soon!Wanqiu could not tell whether she was shocked or if she had just received the news, but ... She would not say that.Hearing this, Li Hao also revealed a happy expression.""Then I'll have to thank fellow Daoist for your support! It just so happens that we also need some time to digest what we've learned from the battle. We'll stay here for a few days. Sorry to trouble you, Daoist Wanqiu!""I wouldn't dare ... It's my honor to have seniors stay in Alliance City 9!"She glanced at the people behind Li Hao and secretly clicked her tongue. They were all a group of brutal people. He couldn't afford to offend him!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have thought of something. He asked,""By the way, do you know anything about the giant kun Peng beast that was with the Samsara Emperor?"Wanqiu was stunned, but she quickly replied,""I'm not too sure, but if it's from the huntian faction, it should be Emperor Pengcheng! In the early years, they formed an alliance with huntian Supreme Emperor. When he reached level nine, he became the leader of huntian's chaos race and demon race ... Huntian Supreme Emperor is a human, and some of the chaos race and demon race are not willing to submit to him ... With great emperor Peng Cheng around, at least it sounds better in name. "Li Hao nodded slightly.The Chaos Beast was not weak. It had the power of a level 8 and had around 4000 Dao laws. It was not as strong as a human King, but it was not considered weak among level 8. The weak ones would depend on Wu Shan and the others ...Alright, it was a slap in the face, but Li Hao naturally wouldn't say it.This time, the reincarnation bombshell could be teleported away directly. If it wasn't for this rank eight Chaos Beast, it wouldn't have been so easy. The reincarnation bombshell might have been destroyed this time. It had to be said that at this time, the role of an eighth-order Chaos Beast was reflected.He could attack and defend.He could take the world with him!As for rank eights like the reincarnation Emperor, they could also teleport, but their speed was extremely slow.The Dragon Lord was an eighth-tier Chaos Beast. The reason why he asked was because he wanted to see if he had any connection with the Dragon Lord. After all, they were all from the chaos race."Fellow Daoist, you do have some understanding of the West. The information about the middle world Alliance is not weak ..."Li Hao's words shocked Supreme Emperor Wanqiu. She hurriedly said,""It's just that some of the top experts in the primordial chaos have some reputation. That's why they know a little about it. It's too far away, and we've only heard about it from hearsay!"Li Hao was just saying that. Seeing her frightened look, he laughed in spite of himself and said,"Fellow Daoist, you've misunderstood. I don't mean anything else ... By the way, I'm able to solve some problems this time because you provided me with information. If your universe of the great path only needs some power of the great path to enter Level Seven, perhaps ... I can help. Best novel online free at‚Äã …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ The person in front of him was also a World Master, a master of the great Dao.Li Hao wasn't sure if he could reach Level Seven.If they simply needed some energy, it had to be said that a piece of information from the other party was worth Li Hao's energy. Even if the human King knew about it, he would not be stingy. Without the information, Li Hao might not have been able to make it in time.Supreme Emperor Wanqiu was overjoyed. Was this ... Appropriate?Can I speak?To them, they were only level six after all. Not to mention level eight, even Level Seven venerable sovereigns were existences they looked up to. To kill a level Seven to fill their own great path universe?What a joke!If it was so easy to kill a seventh step, then they themselves would be seventh step cultivators.However ... To ask for benefits from a group of evil people ... Would he be tired of living?Also, if I reach the seventh step, will they raise me like a pig and kill me after I'm fat?She had many thoughts in her mind, but the temptation of a seventh-grade beast was still irresistible. She was in a difficult position and struggled a little. In the end, she carefully said,""That ... If ... If senior can ... Can provide me with the corpse of a seventh grade venerable sovereign and the power of a great Dao, perhaps ... I ..."Li Hao was stunned."Only a seventh rank venerable sovereign?" he asked.He turned around and looked at Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang.The two of them were expressionless and pretended not to see anything.Don't look!Could it be the same?

Chapter 3455 The King Of Myriad DAOs (3 In 1)
Firstly, Silver Moon had advanced too quickly. Secondly, they did not have enough Foundation and had wasted a lot. Thirdly, they had two Dao universes and not a single Dao universe. Fourthly, this person in front of him had been stuck at the peak of Tier 6 for many years and might only be one step away.Obviously, they understood what Li Hao meant.Just look at him!A seventh stage venerable sovereign's corpse and the power of a great Dao would be enough, but Silver Moon had devoured more than one seventh stage universe, as well as countless great Dao powers and countless great Dao crystals.As for venerable Emperor Wanqiu, she thought that she had asked for too much and angered everyone. She hurriedly said,""If it's not convenient for senior, it's fine. I've been asking for too much ..."Li Hao smiled."No, it's just that ... Forget it, a seventh level venerable sovereign's body ..."He thought for a moment and said,"I really didn't kill a seventh level venerable sovereign this time. I did kill a lot of new martial artists."It would be a waste to give it to a level eight one.They only want seventh-rank ones.At this thought, Li Hao turned around and looked at the celestial pole.""Senior celestial pole, please make a trip to new martial arts and ask for a seventh-rank body as a reward for Supreme Emperor Wanqiu's information. The human King will probably agree. It's just a small matter!"A seventh-grade body was not a Dao universe, so it did not matter.When Heaven's Fate heard this, he also curled his lips. Why do you want me to run?Really!I'm afraid I'll be beaten up if I go back!But since Li Hao had already said so, he could only hesitantly reply. Somewhat depressed, he pulled the unwilling Huai King and left with him. He was not willing to go alone, so he had to take Huai King with him.As for venerable Emperor Wanqiu, she was pleasantly surprised.This ... Could he really get it? Best novel online free at‚Äã …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ He had been nervous and regretful about providing information to these people, but at this moment, he had long forgotten all about it. Who would care about this? if he could enter Level Seven, he would be considered to have reached the higher levels of the chaos!Who would care about a little bit of danger after entering Grade 7?"Many thanks, senior ...""It's what I should do. You're welcome. "Li Hao smiled."Then, we'll stay here for a while. When the myriad transformations Emperor comes, you can inform me!""Definitely!"Li Hao didn't say anything more. He led everyone and disappeared.This time, he had gained quite a lot.He should digest it as soon as possible.If his teacher could take this opportunity to reach Level Seven, Li Hao would have one less thing to worry about.Tier 7. Be careful. In the primal Chaos, even in the outer regions, you can live comfortably.When a rank seven venerable sovereign went out, under normal circumstances, as long as it was not a huge grudge, a rank eight venerable sovereign would not deliberately find trouble with you.And level eight was the current chaos 'ceiling.As for level nine, it was only said that huntian had reached level nine, but whether it was true or not was still open to question.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On this day, Li Hao and the others began their seclusion.Neo martial didn't have any movement either. It was obviously also absorbing and digesting what it had gained this time.On this day, a group of venerable sovereigns fled back to the extreme Ice realm. As soon as they returned, they heard something they didn't want to hear. A group of venerable sovereigns had died, several realms had been destroyed, and they had reincarnated and escaped!New martial and silver Moon had a total of seven level eight venerable sovereigns!Although there were still 15 level eights in the remaining 11-realm Alliance, far more than the two sides, but ... Could all of them really work together?Even if they could ... The Dragon Lord was the one they had offended.Once they were attacked from both inside and outside, what would they do?Last time, the Dragon Lord had cooperated with both sides once.At that time, it would be really troublesome. For a moment, these eighth level venerable sovereigns were in great pain. They couldn't understand how the situation in the East had reversed in an instant, allowing the foreigners from the four-square domain to gain the absolute advantage!As a last resort, the rank eight venerable sovereigns could only move their worlds quickly and try to gather together. Some of the rank Seven Worlds also began to move quickly, trying to form a large Alliance.To prevent new martial from breaking through one by one!The entire east side quickly completed the fusion. The speed was unexpected.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The news was also spreading rapidly.The three Overlord forces in the North, South, and West soon received the news that Dongfang lunhui had been defeated and had surrendered to huntian. Neo martial and silver Moon from the four regions had occupied the East. The East might become an Overlord soon!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the West.At the end.It was a vast and boundless world.An ordinary-looking middle-aged man was also looking to the east. After a long while, he chuckled."I didn't expect that after the master of Tian Fang, the people who walked out of the four-sided region would cause another wave!"He didn't care too much about this defeat.It might not be a bad thing.His own people were not dead and Samsara was moving towards them. This would strengthen the West's forces but they could not pincer the north and south like before.Of course, Samsara wouldn't be so obedient unless they had no other choice.Now, it was a good thing.That group of people had forced Samsara into a corner. To him, this was indeed a good thing.As soon as he finished speaking, an expert whose figure could not be seen slowly said,""Tian Fang's master was much stronger than them, and he was known as the strongest person back then, at the peak of the 9th step! A King of the Dao of space, able to teleport as far as his eyes can see and arrive in an instant ... His strength is inconceivable!""I'm just saying. ""He's an old senior after all," huntian Supreme Emperor said with a smile."Now, those who come out of the four regions are all juniors. It's already very impressive to have such an achievement! There's also that long Zhan. I've actually met him once a few years ago, and I already felt that he wasn't simple. Today, I've proven my judgment ...""It's just a pity ... That long Zhan is bent on leading the chaos race on the path to rise. However, this chaos is still the world of the human race after all. How can it be so easy!"Shaking his head slightly, long Zhan's path was too difficult, too difficult.There might still be a chance if they let go of the chaos race, but to lead the chaos race above the human race was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!"It's said that the Silver Moon King Li Hao practices the Dao of time ..."Huntian Supreme Emperor looked to the South and said,"the spring and autumn guy also said that he cultivated time, but I know that it's not real time. It's just a unique technique. Do you think the spring and autumn will attack the East first?""Why don't I go and secretly capture the Silver Moon King ..."Huntian Supreme Emperor thought for a while and shook his head. "Don't act rashly for now. In the East ... Tianfang may not return, but the experts from tianfang world may return one after another! "This person came from the four-sided domain and is involved in time. Perhaps he's the key to their return ... Although I don't know the details, I've gathered some information that this person has a great relationship with Tian Fang ... Don't act rashly. At the moment, these rank 9s who can't return aren't people we can provoke."The black figure nodded."Then ... Let Chunqiu try!"Huntian Supreme Emperor smiled and nodded.Of course, Chunqiu might not be so stupid as to try, but what if he could not resist the temptation?Flowing time!The title of a true rank nine King tier, invincible in the world, was not said by them, but by the master of Tian Fang in the past. The younger generation did not know, but huntian was considered a senior venerable sovereign, so he knew.He had even seen the master of Tian Fang!He had also seen those invincible ninth level venerable sovereigns, but they could only pale in comparison to the master of Tian Fang.,m That person, at that time, was really invincible.But still, time ... Was the king of all DAOs!Was there really someone who could cultivate time?Or was it just similar, like the spring and autumn, a special Dao?

Chapter 3456 Dao Merging Chaos (1)
Li Hao no longer cared about what the outside world was saying.He had gained a lot this time, so he naturally had to digest what he had gained.Alliance City nine.Li Hao was also filling up his little world. Ever since the incident with the thousand realms, he rarely consumed energy to fill up his little world. He mainly relied on the Queen for nourishment. The Queen was now at the fourth step, so she could provide him with a lot of energy.The speed was actually not slow. Relying on the Queen's supplies, Li Hao had filled up seven to eight small realms.However, in comparison, there were almost no intuitive changes.  Best novel online free at ’≤÷Ö—µ“Ωl’≥√≠’≤  In a short period of time, seven or eight little realms had been filled. This speed was actually very fast, so fast that it was frightening. However, for Li Hao, the number of new little realms he had opened up these days was not only this.Back then, he was worried that the Queen would stuff him to death, but now he realized ... It was too early.If he wanted to stuff himself to death, he had to wait until he reached the seventh step.At the current stage, the energy provided by the Queen was nothing more than a sacrifice for Li Hao.At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about this. He continued to open his little world.Li Hao must have comprehended more than a thousand DAOs.However, due to the lack of energy and time, he had been focusing on perfecting his own Qianjie and hadn't created too many small worlds. At this moment, Li Hao was thinking while creating his own small worlds.The key was the nomological Dao!The power of the great DAOs today was chaotic, or rather, they all originated from chaos. The entire chaotic great Dao was in a state of disorder. Was chaos better or order?In the past, it might not have been clear.However, from the previous battle, Li Hao had made some judgments. Although the man had only used one sword attack, it was obvious that the Dao of rules was more powerful.It was more destructive to the disorder.Countless thoughts flashed through his mind as he turned his gaze back to the time star.As Time and Stars continued to revolve, Li Hao also recorded many changes. The 10000 DAOs of Time and Stars were constantly changing, but there was no pattern to this change at first.But now, Li Hao had actually already seen some patterns.At this point, he couldn't help but sigh. Zhan Tiandi was truly a top genius.He was actually able to complete the combination of 10000 DAOs during that period of time. The combination of 10000 DAOs was based on the understanding of 10000 DAOs. After the comprehension was completed, he had to arrange the 10000 DAOs in order. After the arrangement, it had to be at a higher level and undergo changes!Each level was more difficult than the previous!The most basic step was to comprehend 10000 DAOs. As of now, Li Hao had yet to complete this step. Even when he reached Level Seven, he still hadn't completed this step. He had comprehended many DAOs now, but to say that he had comprehended 10000 DAOs ... He really didn 't.And comprehending the myriad DAOs was only the foundation of time.He had not even reached the foundation. At this time, it was still impossible for Li Hao to walk the path of time on his own. Thus, Li Hao was still in the learning stage.He was already at rank seven, yet he was still learning. To learn from a rank six venerable sovereign ... If word got out, he would probably become a joke. But the truth was as such.Not just the rank-7 Li Hao. At the current stage, there was probably no one in the chaos who could construct time. Otherwise, time would no longer be mysterious.The myriad Dao Pavilion might be the best opportunity for Li Hao to quickly comprehend the myriad DAOs.At this moment, he was just a little puzzled. How did Zhan Tiandi manage to comprehend 10000 DAOs without walking in neo martial world?As for traveling to the past and the future ... That would have to wait until the other party comprehended 10000 DAOs and constructed time. Only then would he have the ability to do so.In the beginning, he must have comprehended the myriad DAOs by himself.In fact, every world had the foundation of ten thousand DAOs.However, they all had their main points.In the neo martial world, there were thousands of DAOs, but some DAOs were so weak that they were difficult to detect. How did you comprehend such DAOs?Li Hao was confused about this, but he also admired it.If it was him, he probably wouldn't be able to do it.Sometimes, when compared, outsiders might think that they are geniuses ... But in Li Hao's eyes, they are not worth mentioning. I can't do it. I can comprehend 10000 DAOs just by staying inside the Silver Moon.The power of the great Dao seeped out of The Broken Earth-shattering world, filling the newly-created small realms.In the original thousand worlds, there were a few worlds that had already stepped into the level of medium-level worlds in terms of energy.For example, the new Thunder World, the New Forest orchid world, and the calamity world ...They were all mid-tier worlds.The other worlds were mostly small worlds. Compared to real worlds, these ethereal extent realms lacked the source of life.,m New realms were opened up one by one.At this moment, there was one more person in the river of the great path ... Dao Qi.Dao chess had returned to its original form, revealing the myriad paths chessboard for Li Hao to study. Dao chess was left behind by the master of tianfang, who had carved his own space Dao on the body of Dao chess.For Li Hao, he would gain more from observing a Dao chess that had been restored to level eight.Not only that ... There was also a book near the Dao chess, the book of Dao.It was from a new martial Supreme.A Supreme neo martial artist had also entered level eight. Li Hao did not know exactly how many great DAOs he had comprehended. He had only heard that the thousand pages of the thousand emperors was very similar to Li Hao's path.Li Hao had transformed Dao into a world, and the new martial Supreme was almost the same as Li Hao. The only difference was that the other party had drawn the Dao law into a book and presented it in a different form.At this moment, Li Hao was still very happy.

Chapter 3457 Dao Merging Chaos (2)
He was not worried about bottlenecks.He had yet to fully comprehend the Dao of Dao chess, and yet, the Dao of a Paragon was being provided to him. He had no idea how long it would take for him to fully absorb and digest it.The pages of the book of Dao opened up one by one.A series of runes appeared before zhang Xuan's eyes, and soon, they transformed into supreme beings who seemed to be rehearsing the great Dao and drawing it into a book.Li Hao had always had such an idea. However, in his current world of divine culture, one Wen, One World, one Dao, it was very difficult to compress it.He hadn't reached the Supreme level yet.The fact that a Supreme martial artist could compress a Dao law into a book actually meant that his comprehension and control of the great Dao were superior to Li Hao 's.Li Hao, on the other hand, had no choice but to convert the divine culture into a world.Small realms appeared around Li Hao like bubbles. Soon, a large amount of great DAOs poured into them and filled the small realms.This time, Li Hao only had one goal, which was to open 2000 realms.As for whether or not it could be filled, that could be discussed later.He would first open up the little realm. That way, the next step would be to fill it up.In the previous world, the path of tribulation was the main path, and the sword of thousand-realm tribulation was formed. At this moment, Li Hao was considering what path the Second World should be based on.To form his 2000-world sword!Once the 2000 realms were filled, Li Hao believed that his combat strength would increase. He would have at least 3000 Dao laws, let alone the power of a top-tier level 8.His power of one realm was at least half times stronger than those grade 8 cultivators who had yet to transform their Dao into a realm. This was the most basic.Therefore, with 2000 realms, his combat power was comparable to a cultivator with 3000 to 4000 Dao laws.Currently, there were not many level eight cultivators in the East who had such strength.Most of them were the weaker ones, in the range of two to three thousand.The Thunder monarch and the others were actually at this stage."Bright moon sword, first sword, calamity Dao sword!"With a thousand worlds as the foundation, how could the 2nd sword be stronger?This was what Li Hao was thinking about.Which world would be the master of the second Qianjie?Life and death?Nirvana revival?Yin and yang?Or something else?In the early days, he had not focused on tribulation sword Dao, but he had advanced to rank seven in tribulation sword Dao. This was mainly because he had gone through too many Primal Chaos lightning tribulations and had this Foundation.The catastrophe sword principle was actually quite destructive. As the 1000-world sword, it was not bad.  Of course, this wasn't a true ninth-grade path. Otherwise, it wouldn't be so weak.  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The 2nd thousand world sword obviously couldn't be a true level 9 Dao. However, it should be used as a supplement to perfect his bright moon sword. It would be very useful against strong enemies."In a battle between experts, there's nothing more than trapping, suppressing, breaking, and exterminating."Many thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind. The calamity sword was actually enough to break through the enemy's defenses. However, at the moment, its trapping and killing power was not strong enough. His main means of dealing with powerful enemies were still time-freezing and suppression.Then, he would strike with his sword to kill!However, time did not belong to him at the moment. What would he do if the time stars were to shatter?"The second sword Dao should still be focused on suppression and entrapment. The Dao of Nirvana will be very useful, and the Dao of revival can also help me recover ..."Li Hao's comprehension of the Dao of Nirvana and revival was actually not weak. Of course, it was still a little weaker than the void.However, he was very familiar with this one.Perhaps, the 2000th world Dao should focus on destruction and recovery. It could suppress the enemy and freeze them for a moment before killing them with the catastrophe sword Dao. It could even extract life force and was comparable to the Dao of life and death.With a single thought, a realm appeared in the river of the great path and expanded instantly.The Dao of Nirvana and revival had already condensed stars.However, after extracting them from the original thousand worlds, he had to rearrange the order of these worlds again to avoid messing up the Dao laws.This was not a small project.The process of destruction and reconstruction was an opportunity for Li Hao to improve himself.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After more than ten days, Li Hao had formed a new thousand-realm domain.Of course, it was almost empty.These days, almost all the power of great DAOs had been used to create small worlds. Only a dozen or so new worlds had been filled up, which did little to no help Li Hao improve his strength.As for the 2000th world, Li Hao decided to focus on the revival of destruction.At this moment, Li Hao, who had been in seclusion for many days, was completing the general structure of the 2000th world.The entire River was shaking.The realms floated in the air and were distributed along the river of Dao. They were densely packed and looked terrifying, but in reality, their strength had not increased much compared to before. They were dispensable.BOOM!With a loud bang, the dust in the 2000th world settled.At this moment, a cat appeared above the river and sized it up. It curled its lips and its whiskers twitched. Soon, it appeared in front of Li Hao. Looking at the 2000 realms above the river of Dao, it was puzzled."You should have gained some insight into the formation of time ... Why don't you follow the path of time? if you follow your own thoughts ... You might not be able to form time in the end."The arrangement of time had its own uniqueness.Li Hao had a certain understanding of the arrangement of the time Dao. He could just copy it according to the arrangement. If he had to be original and construct a new system, it would be very troublesome and might not be able to form a time Dao.

Chapter 3458 Dao Merging Chaos (3)
Li Hao smiled."Time is ever-changing. It's not static. Moreover, time is different in everyone's eyes ... Besides, it's only temporary. Do you want me to replicate Zhan Tiandi's time so that it's unique?""I didn't say that,""But if you walk like this, you might reach three thousand, four thousand ... It's going to be difficult," second cat mumbled."Don't be in a hurry, take it one step at a time. "Li Hao exhaled."For now, I'll fill up my 2000 Worlds first. I'm short of a large amount of chaotic force to fill up. It's fast to destroy worlds, but there aren't so many worlds to destroy. From the looks of it ... Although the Queen's Dao is good, it's very, very slow!"It would be too difficult for a 4th rank Queen to push Li Hao to the 8th rank.Li Hao was silent for a while, then suddenly said,""Er Mao, what do you say if I temporarily merge time into the Dao of chaos? I will enter the primordial chaos! It's better to rely on yourself than on others, and I can't hope that lingyue will always provide me with a large amount of chaotic force ... That's not realistic. ""Perhaps only by entering the primordial chaos and fusing with it can I have the hope of quickly perfecting my own orthodoxy.This was the first reason!Secondly, Dao could merge with chaos. This way, for chaos beasts like the Dragon Lord, their Dao was mostly dependent on chaos. The next time they encountered the Dragon Lord, they would at least be a threat to him.Second cat's chubby face was scrunched up.Li Hao was always on the spur of the moment. He could be considered organized in other things, but when it came to Dao enlightenment, he always liked to take risks and try. As long as he didn't die, he liked to do things randomly.The body melded into the primordial chaos ... The Dao melded into the primordial chaos!A 4th rank Queen had almost killed Li Hao.Li Hao himself had already entered Level 7!How much chaotic force would he have to absorb if he were to fuse with it?  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The speed was indeed fast, but ... Was it really a good thing that it was too fast?If Li Hao, who is at Level Seven, fuses with the Dao by himself, the 2000th world might be completed soon. Can you quickly expand the 3000th world at this time?Li Hao was actually just asking. He didn't say that he had to get ermao to agree. He said to himself, "I'm going to construct an illusory realm of ten thousand DAOs, and my enlightenment of the Dao will definitely be faster. The 3000th realm shouldn't be too difficult! Moreover, the Dao chess and the Supreme martial artist's book of Dao can both give me some insight and help ... By then, I might be able to quickly comprehend the 3000 or 4000 great Dao ...""You can merge with the chaos after you've completed the construction," said the second cat.It's good to think about it now, but what if it doesn't work when the time comes?Wouldn't that be the end of it?Li Hao shook his head."If I don't merge with it now, it'll be difficult for me to perfect my 2000th world. Then, my combat strength will always be at the seventh-rank. If an eighth-rank comes looking for trouble, I won't be able to deal with it!" As for you guys ... I can't always hope for you guys to be my guards, can I?"At the moment, everyone said that Silver moon's side was strong, but in reality, the strong ones were all outsiders.Three tier 8 and a few tier 7 ... They were all outside of Silvermoon.Although everyone had a good relationship.However, these high-level powerhouses all left the four-square region in pursuit of freedom. You can't always have them be your guards. "During the period of setting up the ten thousand illusions, we may encounter some trouble. As for neo martial, they still have things to do, so ... They have to be strong themselves!" When 2,000 realms were filled up, they would be comparable to cultivators with 3000 to 4000 Dao laws. In reality, 2000 of them would definitely be equivalent to a level eight venerable sovereign.At this moment, Li Hao was infinitely close to it, but he was indeed not at the eighth step.Not to mention killing a tier 8!Second cat was still helpless. It was really dangerous.Furthermore ... This fellow was going to use the time star to fuse with the Dao of chaos as the middle point of connection. In this case, a moment of carelessness could cause the time star to explode.But second cat also knew that since Li Hao said so, it meant that he was very determined.It was probably useless to persuade him.He was most likely already preparing to fuse with the Dao."When lingyue fused with the chaos, she had just reached Dao vindication. Now, you're already grade seven ..."At that moment, second cat was also thinking and said,""For an existence at your level, will there be any changes when you fuse with the Dao and chaos?"Li Hao shook his head."I'm not sure, but chaos beasts, even at the eighth level, can also fuse ...""They're just simply attaching themselves to you. You want to completely integrate into them, don't you?"What Li Hao wanted was to be completely bound to the chaos great Dao, just like the Queen.As for the beasts of primordial chaos, they were simply attached to him.This one was different!Li Hao nodded slightly. Second cat said,""Why don't we discuss this with everyone? if you really want to melt it, there might be a way to solve it if there are some changes ... Don't melt it by yourself!"It was so dangerous!This guy always did such unruly things. He was fine on normal days, but when it came to critical moments, he was a little creepy.Li Hao smiled."That's fine. We can discuss it. It's not bad."He didn't say anything more and let er Mao go inform the others. He closed his eyes and pondered.The Dao of chaos ... It was best not to use time, but the river of the great Dao.This was also what he had thought of before. The construction of a pseudo-chaos would also require an endless amount of energy. It was impossible for him to complete the supply, unless he really destroyed the infinite worlds!That ... Was too terrifying.Only by completely merging the river of great Dao into the chaos great Dao and extracting the power of Chaos could a second chaos be created.

Chapter 3459 Dao Fusion Chaos (4)
And today, it was just one step ahead.Although he had yet to construct the pseudo-chaos, he could fuse it in advance.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Not long after.Venerable sovereigns appeared one after another.Everyone had improved, and the one who improved the most was naturally Yuan Shuo. This time, most of the energy and power of great DAOs had been provided to Yuan Shuo alone.At that moment, Yuan Shuo's Dao domain had expanded greatly and he was extremely powerful.As for his aura, it was a little unstable, floating around grade-7. His strength was a little out of control, and whether he could be considered to have completely entered grade-7 would depend on Yuan Shuo's self-stability.If the stabilization was successful, he would be at the seventh step.Even if he did not succeed, he would only be comparable to a sixth-stage venerable sovereign with a Dao universe. This was also the closest existence to the seventh step in the Silvermoon world, apart from Li Hao.Yuan Shuo was in a good mood. However, when he heard that Li Hao was going to merge with the Dao of chaos, he couldn't help but say,""Why are you in such a hurry? Why don't we first forcefully upgrade lingyue ..."The Queen was speechless!These words!However, it made sense. He was only at level four and had already fused with chaos. If he were to forcefully level up, although it would be dangerous, he would be more reliable than Li Hao.Although Yuan Shuo's words were a little selfish, the Monarchs present remained silent.In fact, they also thought so.For now, if a level Seven venerable Emperor were to fuse with the chaos, he might absorb an unimaginable amount of chaotic force. Once the two thousand worlds were quickly filled, Li Hao would encounter some bottlenecks and be unable to complete the structure of the three thousandth world ... He would likely be melted by the great Dao!Li Hao smiled."It's not that dangerous. The Queen can survive even after fusing with it ... Besides, constructing the pseudo-chaos requires endless chaos energy. It can't be completed by constantly relying on the destruction of worlds!""Chaos is vast, and the power of Chaos is omnipresent! Compared to the great Dao universe and the world, the chaotic power is slightly more chaotic and brutal. However, it can be seen everywhere and can be absorbed at any time. This is what we should be planning. "It was too difficult to keep trying to seize the pure power of a great Dao.And now, destroying an eighth-level universe might only help him fill a few hundred worlds. How many eighth-level worlds would he have to destroy?In fact, it would be difficult to fill up a few hundred.If he wanted to complete the structure of the infinite worlds, wouldn't he have to destroy at least 40 to 50 level-eight universes?The kind that had to be kept intact!Then, the entire Primal Chaos 'eighth-tier universe would probably be destroyed by him. Moreover, everyone was gathered together. Others also needed to improve. Even if they really destroyed a world, for example, this time, the few level eight Dao chess players didn't get a single cent!It was fine once, but who would be willing to do it again and again?No matter how good their relationship was, if this continued, the few tier 8 experts would lose their friendship."I've been risking my life to fight with you. Every time I can't get the spoils of war, I'll be injured. In the end, if we don't fall out, it's already considered a good relationship. It's inevitable that we'll part ways.They didn't care, but Li Hao had to consider this. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "I didn't gather you here to persuade me ..."Li Hao smiled."I've made up my mind. I've only asked you to come here for one purpose. I've just fused with chaos, so I'll definitely attract a lot of chaotic force, which will burst out instantly and surge into the river ... I may not have the strength to sort and suppress it. Therefore, I'd like to trouble you to help me sort and suppress it!""The chaotic force will be chaotic and disordered at the beginning of the fusion. Therefore, I need you to help me purify it so that it doesn't destroy my 2000 realms!"It was clear that Li Hao's decision could not be changed.Yuan Shuo frowned slightly and said,"you've fused with the chaos. It'll definitely cause a huge commotion. The power of Chaos will sweep in from all directions!" Right now, the East isn't that peaceful ... If a powerful enemy attacks now ... It'll be very troublesome!""In addition, new martial wants to occupy the eastern land. If you extract countless chaotic power in an instant, will it affect the relationship between the two parties?"He pondered for a while, then looked at Li Hao and said,""I have an idea ...""Teacher is saying?""Let's ... Go to the four-sided domain!"Yuan Shuo suddenly laughed,"the giant Chaos Beast is also strong because of the power of Chaos. We just have to fuse with the Dao in the square domain before long Zhan and the others come back to their senses. We can extract a large amount of chaos power and weaken the other party!" "Of course, it's also very dangerous because it's easy to be attacked by the other party ... I think we still have to discuss this matter with neo martial. It's best if they protect you together. Even if long Zhan finds out, there's nothing he can do ... We can still take drastic measures!"Li haorong asked. How much chaotic force could he extract?It was still unclear.However, when the Queen fused with the Dao and reached level one venerable sovereign, she extracted chaotic force that far exceeded level one. It was normal for Li Hao to instantly extract all the energy in a great world.It was actually very dangerous for him to cause such a huge commotion. He might even attract the attention of the other three overlords.On the contrary, when they reached the four regions, the Thunder region blocked off the prying eyes of other experts. What they faced was only the warring Dragon's side.Long Zhan was not a good person.They were enemies!Li Hao had killed a large number of chaos beasts. Although there was no conflict between the two sides, it did not mean that the enmity had been resolved.
