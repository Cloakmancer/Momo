(Broken chapter, can't finish, continue tomorrow, can save for a day)As soon as the new martial arts came out, the style suddenly changed!At this moment, the huge mirror began to reflect and extend the entire battle scene ...It was also at this moment that Li Hao, who was hiding in the dark, seemed to remember something.Silver Moon had done the same thing before.But ... Now that he thought about it, wasn't the sky screen originally a legacy of the new martial arts?He had always felt that this was a means of communication for new martial to contact the four sides.Today ... Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Was this really a communication method?In the past, neo martial had studied the sky screen for communication purposes, and not ... For the human King to show off?He seriously doubted it!……In the darkness.The Silver Moon martial masters were speechless and envious ... Although it was childish ... He was really arrogant and flamboyant.People like the southern style actually liked to show off like this.However, Li Hao didn't like to show off, so he could only be envious.Neo martial was launched directly!As for them, they could only move in the dark. This made some people feel a little uncomfortable. Look at the arrogant and domineering neo martial artists ... In the eyes of the enemy, of course, they were hateful and shameless.However, in their eyes ... If they were famous, what harm was there in dying?However, when he thought of Li Hao, who wasn't an extremely flamboyant person, he could only drool in envy. Forget it, let's just drool.A Martial Master was after fame and fortune!Who would care about a nameless Martial Master?In the past, when the Silver Moon Martial Master sparred with the local martial masters, countless martial masters had died.Until today, it hadn't changed.It was just that ... It seemed that it would be very difficult to have such an opportunity again.In fact, Li Hao felt it. He knew that everyone was envious of them and hoped that they could become famous in the chaos, not some nameless people, not the Silver Moon members that everyone had mentioned!They also hoped that their names would spread throughout the world.Even if he became famous today and died today!But ...Li Hao was helpless!'I don't have such means. The neo martial artists even specially asked a seventh level venerable sovereign to forge this kind of sovereign weapon and even let the seventh level sovereign maintain it, not to participate in the war. This kind of neo martial artists ... This kind of atmosphere, this kind of preparation, no one can withstand it!'Li Hao had to admit that there were people who were here to create effects in such a time of war. It was not without reason that the king of a human family could quickly leave his name in the chaos.Such a person should not be nameless.With the participation of the new martial, the chaos race, who had been at a disadvantage before, was now able to maintain the battle situation and was no longer completely crushed. The new martial dragged away the four powerhouses. At this moment, long Zhan was fighting against the five elements Supreme Emperor. He was not at a disadvantage even though he was fighting five of them.Samsara and Coiling Dragon were not weak either, but Black Tiger, Qing Qiu, Feng Yan, and Hong Yue could barely handle them if they worked together. In just a short while, the entire situation was turned around.However, even if the new martial and the chaos race joined forces, they could only barely maintain the battle. One could imagine how terrifyingly powerful tianfang world was.As for the Thunder region, there was still no movement.The other party allowed neo martial to enter ... Not necessarily because they were afraid of neo martial, maybe ... They had other thoughts.If you wanted to fish for others, others might also want to fish for you.Would Silver Moon just ignore such a huge incident?Obviously not!"So, letting neo martial in is to ... Save strength to deal with me?"Li Hao was somewhat enlightened!The lightning domain surrounded the area, and at this moment, the lightning within it was powerful. It was clear that many experts had been revived.However, they, who were supposed to stop neo martial, didn 't. Instead, they bided their time.At this point, if he still couldn't see anything, then he would be too stupid.They are targeting me!The battle in the square domain was in full swing. At this moment, a battle seemed to have broken out in the North, but it was too far away to be sensed clearly. Li Hao's eyes flickered. Perhaps ... The North was also in a fierce battle.Spring and autumn or huntian?He couldn't judge.However, he knew that there was a high chance that the North wouldn't be able to interfere. These two tyrants also hoped that the tier 9 experts would be defeated. Therefore, if the North wanted to interfere, they would be targeted by the southwest and Southwest.This was a tacit understanding.They didn't communicate much, but they all had a tacit understanding."Lord Marquis ..."The Silver Moon martial masters couldn't hold it in anymore. 'We're weak, but it's so annoying to keep watching!'"Don't be anxious. You can't eat hot tofu if you're anxious. Neo martial is impressive, but in fact, neo martial doesn't achieve much in every battle ..."Li Hao comforted her.He smiled."Fighting and killing, in addition to making a name for yourself, there are also spoils of war ... Neo martial arts fight more than us and kill more people than us, but neo martial's results have never been as good as ours, so we can't maximize the benefits ..."Of course, there were advantages and disadvantages. The advantage was that the neo martial could be used to the extreme every time, making everyone go crazy and keep it crazy.The disadvantage was that ... The price paid each time was too high, causing the spoils of war to be used up. The harvest was not big after one battle. For example, in the previous battle of the extreme Ice world, many of the spoils of war were used by the human King to resurrect.This was the disadvantage.As for Silver Moon, his own losses were smaller. This way, he could use more of his spoils of war. He might not have gained more than the new martial artists, but he could save more.Of course, there were pros and cons.Silver moon's martial masters were unable to fight to their heart's content. They fought like crazy.

Chapter 3601 Playing A Little Bigger (3)
Even though Li Hao had ordered them to risk their lives this time!But it wasn't suicide ... On new martial arts 'side, sometimes, Li Hao felt that some people were suicidal. They self-destructed when they shouldn't ... That was really crazy, and he couldn't stand this style.Seeing that everyone was looking forward to it ... Li Hao could only say,""It'll be soon, there's no hurry ... We still haven't figured out the strength of the entire lightning territory. Secondly, we can't be sure if there are other powerhouses of the type 9 world around us, and not all of them will take that path. We don't know if the world will recover ... It's better to be careful. "Everyone felt helpless, but since Li Hao had said so ... They had no choice.​ Li Hao had always been a more reliable person.The pursuit was a one-hit victory!With just one battle, he would be able to send the other party into eternal damnation!At this moment, Li Hao used time ripple.……Near the Thunder region.A few people appeared. At this moment, the divine characters of catastrophe above the Black Panther's head exuded a faint wave of catastrophe. Beside him, Hu Qingfeng summoned a person who looked almost the same as Li Hao ... Except for his slightly weaker aura, it was almost impossible to tell if he was real or not!The fluctuation of such an aura seemed to have attracted someone's attention in an instant.……In the lightning territory.A group of people were watching the battle when suddenly, Supreme Thunder's eyes flickered. He looked outside and revealed a smile."It seems ... They're here!"That time cultivator seemed to have appeared.The Dao of tribulation!They're also considered a calamity, so they can easily sense that extremely weak fluctuation. When Li Hao arrived, I knew that Silver Moon wouldn't just sit by and do nothing. It's just that it looks like he's much later than the neo martial artists.It's good that you came out!"Ray, should we let them enter the lightning territory and surround them, or ... Should we take the initiative to kill our way out?""There don't seem to be many level eight silver Moon cultivators. I've killed a few cultivators who entered the realm. I heard that there were Thunderlord, Wu Shan, Dao Qi, and that Li Hao. The other one is myriad transformations, who might be involved ..." Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Silver Moon seemed to only have so many level eights.The fact that Kong Ji had stepped into grade 8 was still not known to outsiders.Many cultivators had been wandering in the lightning territory before and were all killed by them. Before they died, they managed to get some information.However, they were all at the early stage of grade-8, so they weren't scary.Over twenty people had returned from the calamity.Other than the six at the eighth rank, the rest were all at the seventh rank, and they were all extremely powerful.With such strength ... Even if he had dealt with neo martial before, he had a certain degree of confidence. What's more, Tian Fang was still nearby. The world of calamity was naturally not as strong as Tian Fang, but it was not bad. The leader, ray, was not weaker than the light and darkness messengers. Perhaps he would be stronger if they fought alone.However, heaven's side experts were all good at working together in battle.Therefore, if they really fought, light and darkness could defeat him if they joined forces. However, if these two joined forces, they could even fight against long Zhan and the human King. Obviously, the one from Silver Moon was much weaker.The remaining few grade eights were all experienced grade eights and had no difficulty suppressing those who had just entered grade eight.Supreme Thunder looked into the distance and said softly,""Be careful ... Shi Guang! Time was very complicated. According to the Daoist master, reversing time or flowing time could cause some unpredictable effects! Therefore, it's best to wait for them to enter the lightning zone and trap them with the lightning zone so that Li Hao doesn't have the chance to use time. Even if he does, he has to suppress it ... Only then will we have a chance to kill him!""Neo martial is very interesting," he said with a smile."They've got such a big projection here, so we can deal with Silver Moon without worry. Otherwise, we'll have to worry about interference from the neo martial battlefield ..."Now, he didn't need to worry anymore. The other party had directly projected over and could clearly see the battle situation.This human King ... Had a problem with his brain!It wasn't an absolute crushing battle. At this moment, everything was exposed. Such a fool could only live to this day. It could only be said that no one in this era could do it!Otherwise, how could they let such a person dominate the East?He did have strength and was quite powerful, but at most, he was on par with him. There was nothing to be arrogant about.If it was a million years ago, with such a character, he would have long been beaten to death by some tier 9 who he could not stand. Could he still live to this day?"That's right. How can such a person dominate the East? if it was in the past, he would have been taught a lesson long ago!""Don't say that, he's still young ...""So what if you're young? There's no age difference when they die ...""That's true!"“……”Everyone laughed and joked. At this moment, they weren't worried at all. Not to mention that Tian Fang wasn't at a disadvantage, it wouldn't be a big deal even if he was at a disadvantage.Based on their understanding of the master of Tian Fang, as well as the hints given by the Dao master ... This time, Tian Fang's return would definitely not be limited to just this. It was very likely that the clone of the master of Tian Fang would personally descend!Just because they didn't appear now didn't mean that they wouldn't appear forever. They might be waiting for the spirit to gather, or they might be plotting something else. In short, these people were dead for sure!He also needed to absorb a large amount of spirit to give the Dao master a chance to descend.It might be easier if the Dao master descended.This was because ... The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was everywhere!"It seems...They've entered!"At this moment, Supreme Thunder suddenly laughed. They really came. His eyes turned sharp."Seal off the lightning territory and trap them within!"In the lightning territory, countless lightning pillars suddenly flickered. The lightning territory that could be entered and exited at will seemed to have been sealed.Hu Qingfeng and the others, who had just entered the Thunder Zone, were extremely nervous.

At this moment, there were only three people in their group ...No, a man, a soldier, and a dog.Hu Qingfeng was extremely nervous!He wasn't strong, and this time, he was completely bait. Li Hao had made this very clear. The few of them were bait ... As long as this matter was successful, the Marquis would do his best to support him in becoming stronger.At this moment, he had also gained a lot of benefits. From the peak of level three, he had been forcibly raised to level five!He had surpassed many of the older Silver Moon martial masters.If they succeeded this time, they would definitely be able to reach the sixth rank. They might even have a chance of reaching the seventh rank ... However, it would also be extremely dangerous. The Marquis might have said that even if they died, he would resurrect them, but ...Hu Qingfeng was trembling.Black Panther, who was standing at the side, glanced at him. Coward!Dao Qi was a little calmer. After all, he had the strength of an eighth-tier, and he had also absorbed the buzzing myriad poison needle. With such strength, even if the other party had many eighth-tier opponents, they might not be able to kill him in a short time.At this moment, he was following behind Li Hao's shadow, feeling a little strange.This Dao ... Was really F * cking evil.The Li Hao in front of him was really like the real one. Except ... He was a little less intelligent, and he didn't know how he was formed. He had comprehended tens of thousands of DAOs for a long time, but Hu Qingfeng's Dao was more of a mental nature. He couldn't figure out how to turn the virtual into reality."Stay calm ..."p Dao Qi was older, after all, so he consoled Hu Qingfeng."Don't be so nervous ... Maybe someone is spying on us. As long as we don't split up, we're not in that much danger."He didn't know when Li Hao would come.However, he knew that everyone had brought their Ethereal Plane with them. Li Hao believed that it would be quick.However ... What he had to worry about was whether he could deal with them even if they came.After all, the Lord of calamity was also a stage nine expert, and the experts under him wouldn't be too weak. He didn't know much about the lightning territory's information.If they were too strong, they would be courting death.Li Hao's 3000 realms were full, but they were only comparable to 5000 Dao laws. He was considered an expert, but not a peerless expert. He might not be able to do much in such a situation.……Outside.Li Hao's eyes flickered."The lightning zone has been sealed. It looks like they're determined to kill us!"At this moment, he glanced at the projection that was still spreading. It had even crossed the Thunder region and projected toward the four-sided region. In the projection, the human King was fighting against two powerful cultivators alone and actually suppressed them.The light and dark messengers each had strength around 5000 Dao laws, so he could easily tell.When light and darkness joined forces, they could even produce nearly 7000 Dao law power. It was a terrifying improvement.However, he was still slightly suppressed by the human King.The progress of a human King ... Was a little too fast.Li Hao frowned slightly. His goal had always been to catch up with the human King. This time, he had fused 3000 realms and had about 5000 Dao laws. If the human King did not make much progress, he would actually be on par with the previous human King.But ... The next moment, he realized something and cursed in his heart. 'Human King, there's a high probability that he ran back to take charge of new martial. Shameless, I didn't swallow Silver Moon.'Look at me, how kind I am!The current human King probably had the power of nearly 7000 Dao laws. Coupled with his madness, he completely suppressed the two of them."It's not going to be easy to deal with this time ..."Off to the side, Wu Shan looked into the distance and frowned.He seemed to have seen something and frowned slightly. In any case, he didn't seem to be an easy opponent.Li Hao, on the other hand, laughed and said,"what do you mean?" I'm not the human king who only knows how to kill people. This time ... I, Li Hao, won't make a name for myself. I hope that you can display your strength and have a good fight and kill so that everyone in the universe will know that you ..."Everyone was speechless!You're not famous anymore? what do you mean?You're not participating?Then what are we still playing for!Can we fight against those experts?You must be joking!Thunderlord was depressed. Don't mess around!The other Silver Moon martial masters were also embarrassed. Were they ... Trying to quit?We can't do it!We're still too weak, self-destructing won't work either. The other side has a group of at least the seventh step.Li Hao said seriously,"don't be afraid!" They've just recovered, and the source of their power is from the lightning territory. At this moment, the lightning territory is still their main source of power. Over the years, the lightning territory has contained too much energy. They're too strong when fighting in the lightning territory!" Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao narrowed his eyes."But the Lord of calamity has been targeting me and time ... Has he forgotten that most of the energy of the chaos lightning tribulation comes from the lightning territory, not the entire chaos?"Everyone was stunned!Li Hao laughed."I'll go to the human King's side. This time, I'll leave the Thunder region to you!" I'm going to ... Draw down the world-ending lightning tribulation and use the power of the Tribulation to deal with Tian Fang! Remember, if I don't draw out the lightning tribulation, don't rush to attack. I want to draw out all the energy in the entire lightning territory!""A bunch of rootless floating duckweed ... I'll exhaust them to death! "Whether you can make a name for yourself, whether you can vent your anger, it's up to you. So what if you're a group of seventh or eighth-ranked powerhouses without any stored energy? After we withstand the first wave of attacks, it will be time for you to grind them to death!"Everyone was shocked!However, the Thunder monarch was a little worried."You ... You're going to draw away all the power of the lightning tribulation and the power of the Tribulation alone. What ... Are you going to do?"What could he do to achieve this?Li Hao smiled meaningfully. What should he do?Of course, he had to use time!How could he use time to make the lightning tribulation go crazy?There were many methods!"This time, I'm going to let those rank nines know, let the Lord of tribulation know that you made the biggest mistake by striking me with tribulation lightning. You shouldn't have directed the primal Chaos lightning tribulation at me!

Chapter 3603 Playing A Little Bigger (3)
"Don't worry about this ... Remember!"He looked at the projection and laughed."The human King is still too weak. With such little strength, how can he kill two experts so quickly? when have I really reaped great benefits by following the human King, other than fighting? As time passed, these venerable sovereigns were killed, and the power of their great DAOs was also worn down ..."Everyone was speechless!And you're going against the human King?"I'm leaving first. You guys ... Wait for the right time and don't act rashly! Let daoqi and the others hold on for a while ... They won't die. I'll go over first while their attention is on daoqi!"After saying that, Li Hao instantly entered the void and the river of time. He extended and headed straight for the four-sided domain.As for the Thunder region, it was sealed off at the moment. All his attention was on Dao Qi and the others, so why would he care about such a small fluctuation? if it was before, the other party might still be able to sense it, but now, there was a high probability that it would not work.​ When he left, everyone became nervous!"He ... Really left?"F * ck!Before the Great War, their core and backbone had run away. To be honest, although they had always felt that Li Hao wouldn't give them a chance, now ... The opportunity was too F * cking great.He wanted them to deal with the experts of the calamity realm alone.So nervous!Even the few grade-8 cultivators felt their hearts pounding in their chests. They were so nervous!Can we do it?  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Without Li Hao, it was as if they had lost their backbone. They felt very uneasy. At the thought of dealing with the ancient experts by themselves later, even Wu Shan and Thunderlord felt their mouths go dry!……Tian Fang.The battle was in full swing.The human King struck with his blade, and long Zhan struck with his fist. These two overlords were also extremely powerful at this moment. However, their opponents were not weaklings!On the contrary, he was very strong!Even though the human King had suppressed his opponent, it was difficult for him to even win. Let alone killing him, the human King was even more frenzied as his qi and blood surged to the heavens.On the other side, the Supreme martial artists were also having a hard time dealing with the Yin Yang Supreme Emperor.Most of the tier 7 neo martial artists were fighting with Tian Fang's Tier 7.For a moment, they were evenly matched!The people from Tian Fang also felt that it was extremely troublesome. This first battle after the recovery was far more troublesome than they had imagined. The ease they had felt before had all turned into nothingness. At this moment, they even wanted to ask the Thunder region for help!However, the lightning territory ... Seemed to have some fluctuations, perhaps it was on guard against Silver Moon.The venerable sovereigns felt uncomfortable. At this moment, the radiant envoy suddenly roared,""My Lord is about to return. All rank 7s in the four-sided domain, kill them now. Tian Fang will reward you greatly! The power of the ninth step is not something you can imagine ..."There were dozens of seventh rank venerable sovereigns in the four-sided domain, all from different worlds. When the war broke out, they didn't participate. They just watched in silence and even wanted to escape.However, it was not easy to escape now.Upon hearing the light envoy's words, many people were shocked. A level 9 had descended? This ...However, when they thought of how powerful the human King and Dragon Lord were, they didn't dare to interfere. It was too dangerous and they would die!"Kill them!" The light envoy shouted again."As long as you join the battle and kill them, the Daoist master will come. I, Tian Fang, will not take a single cent of the spoils of war from both sides!""There's no need to take too much risk. Just help me, a tier 7 tianfang, kill the tier 7 subordinates of long Zhan and the human King!"He didn't need to participate in the battle of the eighth step!They only needed to surround and kill the tier 7 ones. This was not too dangerous because Tian Fang also had more than 20 tier 7 players participating in the battle. Although there were many tier 7 players on the side of neo martial and warring Dragon, most of them were newly advanced.If a few dozen more came, these people would die without a doubt!At this moment, some people were getting restless.To be honest, they didn't like long Zhan and neo martial. These two people were the ones who created slaughter. In recent years, the four-sided region had been in turmoil and too many strong people had died.And ... Most of them were killed by these people.But ... She was still afraid.The light envoy also cursed in his heart. A bunch of trash!So many people were watching at this moment. No one participated in the battle. If anyone dared to participate, dozens of tier 7 experts, not just a few, would definitely be able to help turn the tide of the battle!Trash!In order to get these people to join the battle, he suddenly threw out a heavy bomb and shouted,""Everyone, as long as you can help Tian Fang maintain stability without killing anyone, my master will descend in a moment ... At this moment, my Dao master is too powerful, and his strength is not tolerated by the chaos. He needs Tian Fang to expand the great Dao universe to cover all directions and maintain stability for a while before he can descend!"The moment he said that, the surrounding Grade 7 experts were all shocked!Is that true?However, since Tian Fang had returned, it seemed possible that the master of Tian Fang would descend.At that moment, the human King sent the light envoy retreating with a single slash. The human King sneered,""Who are you trying to fool? You still dare to be distracted while fighting me! Come back my ass, the master of Tian Fang is already dead. I saw his corpse turn into ashes with my own eyes ..."Of course, this was nonsense. However, at this moment, the human King's expression was somewhat grave.Is that true?Return?It wasn't impossible. It was impossible for the main body, but a clone ... It was possible.If that was the case, it would be troublesome.He glanced at long Zhan ... The human King felt that this guy might be hiding something. Otherwise, he might also know and be able to judge. If he, neo martial, did not participate in the battle, would he just wait for death?That was impossible!This old fellow might still be hiding something."Long Zhan, invite your father to join the battle. We're not afraid of him!""Who dares to interfere?" the human King roared. Do you really think that my neo martial artist's Millennium rise is fake? No background? It's not like there aren't any level nine behind me. Who doesn't have a few level nine venerable sovereigns behind them these days? Behind long Zhan, there's still the primal Chaos Emperor, a rank nine who attained the Dao from Primal Chaos!"

Who's afraid of who?He terrorizes those wandering seventh-rank powerhouses, why don't you all interfere?"Die!" He slashed again and shouted,"help me kill Tian Fang ... Once Tian Fang is out, he will definitely sweep the world and swallow all the worlds ..."“……”Around them, some venerable sovereigns who had been tempted earlier had quieted down and treated them as if they didn't exist!We won't participate!It was hard to judge whether human King's words were true or not, but neo martial was rising extremely fast, and silver Moon, who was under neo martial, was rising even faster!Was there a ninth-rank behind him?He did not know.In any case ... He was not to be trifled with.Don't be blinded by a temporary benefit, or you'll be finished.The radiant envoy almost cursed!This new martial human King was full of nonsense, but he could actually scare people.At this moment, his eyes were extremely cold."Fang ping ... Don't think that these words are false. If you retreat with neo martial arts now, you still have a chance. Otherwise, when the Daoist master descends, it will be the day of your neo martial arts 'extinction! Daoist master once said that the immortality of neo martial arts lies in the cultivator of time back then ... And not because you are too strong!""This chaos is far more complicated than you think ... Also, the chaos race is ultimately just a beast race, while we are the human race! You're seeking death by helping the beasts. None of the ninth level venerable sovereigns are from the chaos race. Are you going to risk universal condemnation?"Intimidate!He was a little unhappy that he couldn't take them down and was even suppressed.At this moment, he was being suppressed by the human King. This madman, he didn't care if he was injured or not. When others were injured, he acted as if he had gained a huge advantage. He roared madly. Those who didn't know would think that he had killed two powerful experts.After a few times, the radiant envoy felt extremely uncomfortable.At this moment, he was working together with the dark Demon envoy, and he was even angrier and exploded.This bastard, he deserved to die!……Just as they were engaged in a fierce battle, long Zhan was also engaged in a fierce battle. However, he seemed to be a little distracted.The light envoy might not be lying.Tian Fang's clone might really descend.The great Dao universe expanded and blocked all directions. Perhaps Tian Fang could really descend ...At this moment, he was a little uneasy.It was very rare!However, he was indeed uneasy. If neo martial didn't come to help this time, he might not have this plan and might not succeed. However, with the help of neo martial, he might have a chance ... To destroy Tian Fang's clone!The clone of the number one expert might not be as strong as the original body, or even a true type 9, but it was definitely an invincible existence among type 8 existences, even stronger than huntian!Could he ... Take it down?If he could take it down and succeed in seizing it, he might become an existence comparable to chaos heaven, or even an existence that was a level higher.Only then would he have enough capital to participate in the upcoming struggle for hegemony of chaos!He looked around ... As long as new martial was not defeated, as long as there were no accidents, there was still hope to maintain it for a while. It must not be defeated, otherwise ... He could only use it in advance. Perhaps, he could only escape from the square domain next.Also, it would be best for him to tangle with Silver Moon in the lightning territory. Otherwise, once the lightning territory sends reinforcements, it would also be a huge change.Li Hao would probably make a move, right?"Hold on!"At this moment, long Zhan let out an explosive roar. His Golden Dragon body swept around, forcing the five powerhouses to retreat! Wu Xing was also extremely solemn!This guy was too difficult to deal with!The next moment, long Zhan's eyes suddenly changed slightly. He instantly looked into the distance and his eyes moved slightly. How ... Could it be!The fluctuation of time?It definitely was!In this place, he was the strongest, so he could sense some fluctuations. These were the fluctuations of time.It definitely was!Had Li Hao gone crazy?Did he come alone?Then who ... Was the Thunder region dealing with?Was he crazy?Could it be that he wanted Wu Shan and the others to come and help him while dealing with the Thunder territory's experts? or could it be that they wanted to deal with him? no matter what ... Wu Shan and the others were definitely not a match for the Thunder territory. They were simply courting death!This guy had always been extremely stable. Why did an unforeseen event happen this time?  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  A change had happened to the person who shouldn't have happened!Long Zhan was somewhat uneasy for a moment!……A moment later, the human King also sensed something, and his expression changed slightly. In an instant, time fluctuated!The sound of the river seemed to have entered everyone's ears.The light envoy and the others were also stunned.A moment later, they seemed to have thought of something. They were a little surprised, and soon, the eyes of two people in the five rows flickered ... Was it ... That time cultivator?Li Hao!Was it him?What was he doing here? what was that cultivator from the lightning territory doing?Right at this moment, all of a sudden, in the distance, the lightning territory erupted into chaos. The voice of Supreme Thunder resounded out in anger,""It's not him, damn it!"It wasn't li Hao!BOOM!A loud sound resounded through the world. The next moment, the long river suddenly rippled. In an instant, it was as if someone had entered. The next moment, waves of eighth-tier auras rose up. The auras of the Thunder Emperor, Wu Shan, Dao Qi, and the others all erupted."We'll kill you!"A loud shout rang out.It was as if they were saying that they could kill him without Li Hao's help.At this moment, the human King's expression changed. He suddenly cursed,""You're too bold. Go back quickly. When I came, I sensed at least six rank eight auras, all very powerful. You've underestimated your enemy!"Although he felt that Li Hao's arrival was just in time, now was not the time.This little fellow was still too inexperienced!He had underestimated his enemy. This time, Silver Moon was going to suffer a heavy blow, or even a destructive blow!Li Hao actually came here by himself. Was he crazy?You want those people to deal with an expert from a type 9 world?

"There are six level 8s and a large number of Level 7S. You're playing with fire! You're not strong enough to kill them!"The Silver Moon King?"At this moment, the light envoy suddenly shouted,""Silver Moon King, do you still know Coiling Dragon and Huo Yan? I heard that you have enmity with long Zhan, and now you're helping us to kill long Zhan ..."He shouted, but ... The next moment, he frowned.At this moment, Li Hao's figure and aura appeared. When the radiant envoy saw it ... He was a little disappointed. Regardless of whether Li Hao was here to help them or kill them, this time cultivator who was rumored to be outrageous only had ... A strength of around 5000 Dao laws.It was not as strong as he had imagined!He was only on par with them individually. Among those present, other than the light envoy and dark Demon envoy, there were also the Joint Forces of the life and death Emperor and the Yin Yang Emperor. They all surpassed Li Hao, and there was also the human King and long Zhan ...These people were all stronger than Li Hao.It was far less powerful than he had expected!This fellow, one more might affect the overall situation, but to be honest ... It might not have much of an impact.Not strong enough!At the very least, he wasn't as invincible as everyone had imagined!But at this moment, Li Hao didn't seem to care about them. He just chuckled. "I'm Li Hao!"Nonsense, everyone knows you!He looked up at the sky as if he had seen something. He laughed. At this moment, his laugh was cold and vicious.Time and Stars were floating above his head.Li Hao's smile was extremely bright."I control time!"In that instant, time and the stars began to spin crazily as a unique energy began to flow out like a river.Li Hao stood above the river with a bright smile!His aura was fully released!3,000 realms appeared, and the laws of the great path formed a large domain. He did not participate in the battle. He just smiled brightly and continued to use the power of time."Freeze!"With a low roar, time filled the world, as if the entire world was going to freeze!The powerful time power exploded out!Primal Chaos tribulation lightning suddenly appeared above his head ...At first, it was not big, but then it surged crazily. Countless power of Thunder tribulation emerged. In the distant thunder region, a large amount of power of Thunder tribulation suddenly gushed out. Compared to the power of the Thunder region that others had mastered, the great path nomological law was the key!Back then, the master of the great Dao of tribulation had set a law!Kill flowing time!Someone was using the power of time to summon tribulation lightning. That was the first natural law. Unless the host of the Tribulation appeared and retracted the natural law ... There was no way that the likes of Supreme lightning could control it!"Not good ..."In the distance, Supreme Thunder and the others, who hadn't paid much attention at first, suddenly felt that something was wrong!The power of the God tribulation lightning gushed out crazily, and even the strength that they had recovered was being drained. This was because the source of this power was the lightning territory, and this energy was the power of the God tribulation lightning.At this moment, Li Hao's long hair fluttered in the wind as he stood on the river.He revealed a smile.Is that enough? Not enough!What was this?Today, I'm going to challenge the strongest lightning tribulation!It wasn't easy to empty out the Thunder region. Just freezing time wasn't enough!"Time is the only thing ... Reverse time and space!"With a low shout, time and space seemed to be reversed!With Li Hao's shout, the river fluctuated violently. At this moment, countless shadows seemed to appear above the river. A man appeared at the end of the river, somewhat shocked, somewhat surprised, and somewhat at a loss ...He looked around and seemed ... Shocked.I ... How did I get out?Was the time King going to open up the primal Chaos?This ... This fast?  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Li Hao's voice resounded again,""Above the river, there is no past, present, or future ... By relying on the river, you can merge three bodies. The past and the future are all in the river!"It was as if he was speaking to that person, as if he was speaking to himself!He wasn't surprised that the group of people had appeared above the river, because this person seemed to have figured it out before. At this moment, the group of people was getting closer and closer, and the lightning tribulation above Li Hao's head was at its peak!Because Li Hao was too crazy!He had actually reversed the past and the future. He was crazy!"Human King, long Zhan ... It's up to me to reverse the situation!"Li Hao suddenly laughed. The next moment, under everyone's shocked gazes, he chuckled."Look at me. I'll turn around and kill their past bodies!"Time was reversed!The river flowed backward. Li Hao stepped into the river and went against the current. At this moment, everyone was in a daze. What ... Are you going to do?Change the past?The past could not be reversed!The human King's expression changed. Li Hao ... You're crazy. How are you going to reverse this? As for Li Hao, he didn't go too far. He only walked to a place not far from the river. That was ... When Tian Fang had just recovered, he had smiled. At that moment, countless lightning tribulations appeared above the river. Li Hao suddenly looked at the future River ..."You ... Can you come out and help me block the lightning tribulation?"“……”In the distance, the young man was expressionless and seemed to be in bad luck!艹!What are you doing?You summoned me here to ... Block the lightning tribulation?By the way, was this lightning tribulation very strong?You're afraid?"You should have mastered the Dao of tribulation. The first time you appeared, you could only use it above the river ... I haven't opened up the chaos, so you can't walk out of the river of time ... But this lightning tribulation has invaded the river ... You can fight it and test the strength of the experts of my era. This lightning tribulation ... Is probably close to the ninth level. It's nothing. There are countless ninth-level cultivators in my world. If you can't even withstand a power close to the ninth level, you'd better not come out. Otherwise, it's too dangerous and you'll die!"

"I saw that you were extremely weak the last time you attacked ... This time, there are many of us. I wonder if you can resist ..."Li Hao smiled."If you can't ..." He said,"go back!""Goading me?"That person seemed to be responding, but there was no sound.……At this moment, at the end of the river, the young Su Yu suddenly grinned and looked around.""He's goading me, did you guys hear that?"He grinned and laughed a little crazily and gloomily.""He's goading me ... This time's old fart is goading me ..."The surrounding crowd was speechless.Yes, he goaded you, but ... Didn't you get goaded?The young Emperor grinned."Alright, I've been goaded. I've thought it through. After I leave, after I really leave ... I'm going to beat him up!" The old man is incompetent, yet he still dares to look down on me?"He laughed,"lightning tribulation?" Close to level nine? Interesting ... Is he very strong? "I've already mastered 49 rules, and I'm invincible. I'm close to level 9, which means I'm at level 8. In the past era, level 8s...Were they very strong?"He wanted to give it a try. He was very curious. This was his first time as well. Perhaps, he could truly fight with the experts of this era. Although it was only a little lightning tribulation, it seemed to be created by humans.The path of calamity?Interesting!In that case, it was only created by a ninth-rank?The master of the natural order?It's nothing!I'll try it!"Don't be careless," someone beside him advised."You can't even defeat the young time King ... You ...""It's fine. Let's give it a try. If he's really strong ... We'll work together!"The young man laughed, and a book appeared in his hand."I'd like to see if the power of our space civilization can't suppress a mere lightning tribulation. I've experienced a lot of these things in the heavenly battlefields ..."What the hell!Even though it's an ancient lightning tribulation, I'm not afraid!He took a step forward. It was as if he had transcended time and space. It was as if he had truly entered the modern world. Although he couldn't walk out of the long river, it was enough. At this moment, his future body had walked out of the future ...The Tribulation lightning that had been chasing Li Hao suddenly changed its direction!An extremely powerful force of the Thunder tribulation instantly turned into a long spear and shot straight at Su Yu!An existence like this, whose body was filled with the power of time, should be killed!In the distance, Li Hao laughed. You ... Enjoy the lightning tribulation of this era. I won't chat with you anymore. I'm going ... To destroy the past of others!The lightning tribulation would continue to grow stronger!Because I'm still using time, I might be infinitely close to the ninth rank!I don't know if you can withstand it, but if you can 't, you won't die, right?At this moment-a person appeared above the river-he was holding a book that read-look down upon the universe civilization "!As for Li Hao, he instantly merged into the river of the past. The moment Tian Fang awakened, he wanted to kill the radiant envoy and the others from the past. Even if they didn't die now, they would be greatly disturbed!Play, just play a little bigger!You'll be very happy during the Tribulation!BOOM!The boundless lightning tribulation had gone mad and furious. Someone was provoking the primal Chaos lightning tribulation without limit. The lightning Spear instantly shot toward the young man, wanting to kill him in one strike!The young man didn't say anything. A book appeared, and a great Dao appeared, extremely thick!Rule force instantly covered the long river.49 extremely thick nomological Dao, each of which seemed to have a spirit, instantly attracted the attention of countless people. When the human King took a look, he was slightly stunned. What ... Was this?He couldn't see the details, but he could see that the intensity of the lightning tribulation changed slightly."Be careful, it's close to 8000 Dao laws ..."F * ck!What a powerful lightning tribulation, and it's still getting stronger. Will this thing summoned from the river be able to do it?Li Hao was crazy!If he couldn't withstand it, time would be shattered and he would be finished. He would be completely lost in the river or even die!I thought I was crazy enough, but there's something even crazier!Just as he was thinking, BOOM!The loud sound reverberated through the long river, the past, and the future. Above the long river, the young man retreated frantically. Fresh blood splattered, and the book of civilization shattered. He coughed out blood non-stop with a face full of anger!“艹!”So strong!Damn time King, I'll remember you, you big scammer!The human King and the others were all stunned. 艹!He didn't die?Long Zhan's expression changed slightly."There are only 5000 Dao laws, but ... Rules become Dao. It's infinitely close to 8000 Dao laws ... It's on par with Li Hao's realm Dao and great Dao power!"One Dao was at least 1.5 times the power of a great Dao. This person only had less than 5000 Dao laws, but his strength was infinitely close to 7500 Dao laws!The future?Where did Li Hao get such an existence?They seemed to have met before, but at that time, the attack from a distance was not too strong. Today, the other party walked out directly, and it was terrifyingly strong!……Su Yu, who had been pushed back, looked terrible. He had lost in one blow!Damn it!Was this era that dangerous?It was only his first time out and he was already severely injured. This ... Was too dangerous, right?Was there a need?"In this era, there's a lot of tier 9 cultivators, but now ... I can't even handle the power of a tier 8 cultivator ...."The young Emperor felt a little helpless."I've already reached the pinnacle of the primal Chaos with 49 great Dao laws. Back then, when the time King opened up the primal Chaos, he should only be at this level of strength. At most, he would be slightly stronger. In that case ... He's nothing in this Primal Chaos?No wonder Qiong said that there were powerhouses everywhere back then! As expected!I've gained knowledge!In the next moment, he pulled himself together. Yes, it was still alright. Perhaps ... He could still wear this thing out!"Civilization!"Countless divine texts appeared and transformed into a great Dao, trapping the lightning. Some divine texts suppressed it, some wore it down, some trapped it, some extracted it ...At this moment, the power of the God tribulation lightning was being consumed!In the distance, countless bolts of tribulation lightning were being drawn away from the lightning territory. It was clear that the lightning tribulation felt that it could not be suppressed and needed to be strengthened.At this moment, Li Hao merged with the past and stepped into the past.Tian Fang was recovering!Li Hao didn't say anything. He instantly appeared and entered Tian Fang. With a slash of his sword, he killed dozens of cultivators!BOOM!The river of time shook violently!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The venerable sovereigns who were still fighting with the human King and the others suddenly vomited blood. Their eyes were filled with horror as if something had appeared in their memories. The next moment, sword marks appeared on some of them ... In the blink of an eye, blood was flowing out!"Li Hao!"The powerhouses roared crazily!"He cut off our past bodies in the past, and he actually ... Projected them all the way to the present!……Thunder region.At this moment, the cultivators of the Thunder region also roared,""Li Hao!"The power of the God tribulation lightning was being sucked away, and their power was rapidly weakening.Li Hao had gone crazy!The energy that had accumulated in the Thunder region for countless years had been drawn away by him alone, and it was even flowing away crazily. If this continued, they would die!……At the end of the primal Chaos.The Lord of calamity, who had been closing his eyes, suddenly opened them and growled,""Li Hao!"His eyes were filled with anger!Damn it, damn it!"He actually made use of my regulations. If this continues, the lightning territory will be finished. As for Tian Fang, he doesn't care whether he lives or dies. However, he has paid a huge price and even offended Tian Fang to make those people return ... This time, he might suffer a huge loss!No, he had to stop it immediately!However, he wasn't actually in the primordial chaos. The natural laws of the primordial chaos ... Had been set in place years ago, and he was currently incapable of reversing them!"Damn it!"He roared,"Li Hao, you deserve death!"I will kill you!

Chapter 3607 Descent (1)
Chaos was roaring!Numerous powerhouses were roaring madly!Li Hao turned back time, entered the past, and fished out the future, the fake emperor of chaos ...The past, the future, and the present were three in one!At this moment, it could be said that time had been used to the extreme. The entire time star seemed to be unable to support it and was showing signs of breaking.As for the primal Chaos tribulation lightning, it was madly absorbing energy from all around it, the energy of the lightning domain.Kill this group of people!Killing time cultivators ... This was the master of the calamity. A million years ago, he had set the rules. It was easy to set them, but it was difficult to reverse them. The other party was not in the chaos now, and the spirituality of the chaos was lacking. It was far inferior to a million years ago.All of a sudden, he was unable to change the rules.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  There were some rules set by those at the ninth rank ... But today, these rules were being madly used by someone.Within the lightning territory.Thunderlord and the others roared in anger, while Dao Qi and the others were overjoyed and attacked crazily!The Dao domain emerged.Thousands of poisonous stingers!Six godly fists appeared, and Thunder roared. The myriad transformations Emperor also appeared at this moment. Countless illusions shrouded the heaven and earth. Wu Shan stirred the wheel of fate. The originally Dark Fate seemed to be blooming with light at this moment. Li Hao's appearance seemed to have instantly reversed the situation!The Tian Fang cultivators who were fighting with the human King and the others all spat out blood and roared madly."Li Hao!""Stop!""You owe me, Tian Fang, a favor ..."The light envoy roared.Li Hao was killing their past. Although he had killed them, he didn't really kill them. The scars of the past reflected to the present. How could people like the human King be easy to deal with?He seized the opportunity and exploded with madness.On the other side, the Supreme-being was also shocked. In his shock, he also revealed a smile.This Supreme martial artist of neo martial arts had always been slow and unhurried. He seemed to be out of place with the madness of the human King.However, at this moment ... The yin and yang messengers were also severely injured. The Paragon laughed, and the book of the great Dao suddenly appeared. In an instant, a portion of the countless tribulation lightning bolts in the long river were suddenly extracted!A clone appeared, as if a calamity had descended upon the human world.The Dao of tribulation!Many people were shocked. The Dao of tribulation ... Even a new martial Supreme knew it?Countless bolts of lightning swept toward him, and a cold look appeared on the Supreme Being's face. Originally, it would have been a little troublesome to kill the person before him, but now that he was injured and the primal Chaos lightning tribulation was right above him, if he didn't make use of it ... He would have to apologize.The pointer in his hand suddenly turned into a long blade.The pointer also had a bit of teaching intent.Saber ... Killing intent.He wasn't really called Zhi Zun. His Daoist name was the bi 'an martial King!King of martial arts, King of neo martial arts!One clone after another walked out of the book, as if they had merged into one, and their Supreme aura instantly soared.In the distance, the human King's expression changed slightly when he saw this. è‰¹!When did you steal a bunch of energy again? why didn't I know?Where did you steal it from?Without energy, it would be difficult to increase the number of clones. However, when a Supreme martial artist reached the eighth rank, he only had 1000 clones. Now, he seemed to have more than 2000 clones, almost double the number.Even a rank eight world might not have enough energy.Where did you steal it from?"Old Zhang, where did you get your energy from?" the human King couldn't help but roar.I don't believe it!How can I not know how much wealth new martial arts has?Where did you get so much energy from a level-eight major world, and not an ordinary one at that, to perfect your Dao?How the hell did I not know!The Supreme martial artist turned back to look at the human King and smiled with a little pride, a little arrogance, and unfathomability. Do you think that neo martial arts are all under your control?You're wrong!I'm the boss of new martial!At that moment, a cat muttered,""He stole all my fish ..."The human King was furious!This is too much!You stole a cat's fish?More importantly, the big cat didn't tell on him. You stupid cat, why didn't you tell me?However, even if he stole big cat's fish, it shouldn't be enough. Big cat's fish was quite a lot, but it was definitely not comparable to a top-tier level eight world. Old Zhang had other gains!The human King didn't have the time to ask. At this moment, his Supreme-being aura surged.Originally, a Supreme-being had only just entered the eighth level. After handing over his neo martial, he could barely maintain the power of the eighth level. However, as the number of clones increased and 2000 clones fused, the strength of a Supreme-being reached nearly 4000 great Dao in an instant.Such strength was only comparable to the two messengers of yin and yang.However, at this moment, sun god growled from the side. This veteran venerable sovereign, the first venerable sovereign of new martial arts world to step into Level Seven, a venerable sovereign who was even earlier than the human King realm, suddenly roared. In the distance, above the long river ...The future emperor, who was resisting the lightning tribulation, suddenly changed his expression. He looked down and saw that person ...He saw the middle-aged man!It was as if ... It was familiar.He was slightly stunned. He ... Had never seen this person before, but he seemed ... Somewhat familiar.Why?As for the sun god, he looked up at the person. At that moment, his eyes flickered and he revealed a smile. His lips moved slightly."Emperor Yu, we meet again!"As soon as he finished speaking, divine text appeared!Yes, divine text.Countless divine runes appeared on the sun God's body.There were all kinds of "character formulas" in the neo martial Star Town City, the neo martial sacred land, and the martial Dao sacred land.Li Hao's Holy prose was actually derived from the ultimate technique of Star Town City.Li Hao had always felt that it was normal for the great Dao to be somewhat similar. He had learned the neo martial art and improved it, so he didn't find anything wrong with it.

Chapter 3608 Descent (2)
But today ... The sun god, a top-notch martial arts powerhouse, suddenly had countless divine runes appear."Break,""suppress,""shatter,""kill,""sky,""desolate ..."Divine runes appeared one after another, as if they had existed since ancient times!The sun god smiled and raised his head to look at Emperor Yu. He laughed and said,""I ... I've found you!"BOOM!The punch broke the sky!All of a sudden, he seemed to have become much stronger, as if he had completely understood something, as if he had broken the shackles in his heart. He had found this person, and he knew his background!The future emperor!Emperor Yu!He was actually from the future."Yang-realm invincible!"With a low roar, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. Sun envoy's expression suddenly changed. This punch of sun god was filled with Yang Qi and was unimaginably powerful. It seemed to come from the past, the future, and the present!Three in one! no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  Three body technique, three body technique ...The past, the future, and the present seemed to have merged into one.Neo martial Heavenly King suppression was the disciple of the sun god. He had always cultivated the avatar technique and cultivated different techniques. Very few people knew that the sun god also cultivated the avatar technique because they had never seen it.But today ... It was as if two clones had walked out of the endless void, as if they had walked out from the past and the future.It was as if ... He had just walked out from Emperor Yu's side.The past, the future, the present ... And the present were all above the river.Sun god laughed. This low-key veteran powerhouse had merged his three bodies into one at this moment, instantly erupting with unparalleled Yang Qi. Unparalleled strength and unparalleled might. When he punched out, sun envoy's expression changed in shock!How could it be?Beside him, the martial King also struck out with his saber, and the yin envoy's face was also filled with shock!The two of them had just entered the eighth rank, and now that they had suddenly burst out with unparalleled strength, they were no weaker than any of them, not to mention that they were still affected by the past."Why would I?"The two of them couldn't believe it!What was that just now?Why did the new martial sun god suddenly summon a clone? if it did, it should have appeared earlier. Why did it only appear now?This divine text ... The Silver Moon King seemed to know it, so why did the sun god know it as well?Neo martial and silver Moon did not cultivate the same path!Also, why would the existence above the long river also have this?What was the relationship between these three people?Everyone was incomparably shocked. Even the human Kings were stunned for a moment. It was the Supreme martial artists who were deep in thought, as if they had expected this.Sun god, who was always out of place, wearing flower underpants, drinking coconut juice, had always been indifferent to the development of neo martial arts. He always seemed to have some thoughts and a knot in his heart.Today ... He seemed to have broken through these.At this moment, the sun god was solemn, cold, arrogant, and crazy ...There was no trace of the past. "Die!"The divine runes suppressed, and countless divine runes burst forth with a loud boom. Opposite him, sun envoy waved his fist, and the extreme yang great Dao erupted, but it was broken at this moment!BOOM!The sun Messenger couldn't believe it. His body was crushed and he roared,""That's impossible ..."How could someone from neo martial suddenly become so strong?The sun god was incomparably cold and did not look at him. He turned his head again and looked at the person in the long river who was resisting the lightning tribulation. He revealed a smile ... Emperor Yu, I've been waiting for you!So this was the three-in-one!It turned out that the three-body Fusion could only be truly completed at this moment.It pierced through the past and the future!Li Hao entered the past, he came from the future, and neo martial was in the present ... This was the three-in-one!His powerful aura shook the heavens and earth. In the blink of an eye, he had reached 4000 Dao laws from the initial stage eight. He swung his fist again and again, and his voice shook the heavens and earth."Emperor Yu, when will you be able to descend? I'll wait for you!"Above the river, the young Emperor was slightly stunned. He looked at the man with some doubt, but soon, he thought of something and his eyes moved slightly.è‰¹!'These Holy prose ... This three bodies as one technique ... Why, it's a little like ... Like what I taught them?'What was going on?Do these old fellows in the chaos still have any relationship with me? BOOM!There was an explosion.Below, the sun god's second punch, which was mixed with countless divine runes, almost shattered the Yang envoy into pieces. The Supreme martial artist's blade also shattered the yin envoy's body!These two, on the contrary, were bursting with unparalleled power at this moment.Although they weren't as strong as the human King and the others, they were the first to see a complete reversal on the battlefield. A complete reversal!At the side, Cang Mao's fishing rod struck out. In an instant, the origin of the great Dao, the yin-yang stars in the great Dao universe, was suddenly ... Caught by the hook. An incredible scene appeared.The cat was all smiles, and the fishing rod pierced through the sky. The cat's claws grabbed the fishing rod and dragged it with all its might. "Let's go fishing!"BOOM!The two stars were actually ... Pulled out from the great path universe by the other party."That's impossible ..."The two messengers of yin and yang hadn't died. Their physical bodies had barely recovered, but at this moment, they were filled with disbelief.How could it be!How could this be? this cat had fished out their great path stars from the great path universe ... What kind of ability was this?What kind of spell was this?As for the big cat, it had fished up two stars in an instant. At this moment, it grinned.""Big Bad guy Zhang, don't even think about stealing my fish this time ..."The two stars turned into small fish, fish of yin and yang, swimming in the world.They were the origin stars of the great Dao of two type 8 powerhouses!They were both top powerhouses who had combined yin and yang. To powerhouses, the temptation was huge. However, the next second, the cat suddenly opened its mouth and swallowed the two small fish.

Chapter 3609 Descent (3)
"What?!" The human King's expression changed as he roared,"give me one!"You ate it?Why are you eating so fast?I also cultivate the Dao of yin and yang.Creak!The big cat chewed the star to pieces, while the Supreme Being and the sun god both looked helpless. This guy ... Was really black-hearted.At least we fought together!I did steal your fish, but this time, I didn't say I stole it ...The Grandmaster smiled and said nothing more. He slashed out with his saber. BOOM!The loud noise sounded again!The two powerful venerable sovereigns had only been here for a day, but at this moment, their faces were ashen. They had lost, lost miserably. Their physical bodies had been destroyed, their great DAOs had been destroyed, and their daosource had been fished out.This ... What else was there to say?BOOM!With a loud explosion, sun god also punched out at the same time.The two messengers of yin and yang both had a look of death on their faces. They smiled sadly and returned ... To ... Recover ... To ... Fight for ... The ... Grade nine ...It turned out that it was all just a dream!Hong long long ...There was an explosion."Your Daoist name isn't good!" The Grandmaster chuckled."Of all the names, call it Yin Yang emissary. If I don't kill you, who should I kill?"On the other side, the human King also let out a fierce roar. As he was enraged, he couldn't help but curse,""Long Zhan, are you mating?"“……”They had been fighting for five days and had been fighting until now!However, long Zhan did not say a single word. In fact, he was also speechless. There was no other way to speak of difficulties ... Li Hao did not deal with Wu Xing's past. Yes, he did not!He was not injured. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  Clearly, Li Hao did this on purpose. He owed two of the five people a favor, so he didn't deal with their past bodies at all. Therefore, while the other people's opponents were weakened, there were a few who were still strong.There were still five more Imperial emperors left, not even the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor!This was a scam!The human king only knew how to roar, but did he know the situation?Who was mating?You are!……At the same time.Upstream of the river.Li Hao wielded his sword and slashed again and again, killing almost all the cultivators in the field. However, there were still a few people in front of him. Li Hao smiled."Seniors Huo Yan, Coiling Dragon, and Shui Linglong ... This time, I won't kill you to repay you. It might not be enough ... But I'll keep you alive. After that, I'll pay you back!" In the past world.Their expressions changed drastically. Among the five sects, someone shouted angrily,""You're an ingrate! If it wasn't for me, Tian Fang, would you have been able to reach where you are today? You killed everyone's bodies ... And you're returning the favor by not killing them ..."How hateful!What kind of favor was this?Li Hao smiled and said softly,"you're wrong. It's up to me whether I pay you back or not. If I say I've paid you back, I have paid you back ... Besides, I ... Don't owe you anything!"As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and swung his sword!The sword of time instantly struck out. With a boom, Jin Xingcheng exploded from the five elements. Huo Yan and the others turned around, their faces filled with sorrow.Li Hao didn't care.He looked around. At this moment, he didn't care if he stayed or if he would be killed by the lightning. The more that came, the better. In any case, the future person would resist it, and it had nothing to do with him!He had killed almost all of them.He didn't know what was going on in the outside world for the time being, but presumably, the human King and the others should be able to seize the opportunity, and so could the Dao chess.At this point, if they still couldn't grasp the opportunity, these people would be too useless.He flew up into the sky above the tianfang realm, where there was another statue.The master of tianfang!Li Hao floated into the air. The statue seemed to be alive, but also dead. Li Hao took a step forward, and the statue ... Seemed to open its eyes.Li Hao's expression didn't change.He had long known that this statue might have been the storage of Tian Fang's clone. At this moment, Li Hao was only looking at it. This was only a fragment of the past, not the real inside of Tian Fang!Li Hao looked at it for a while and sighed.""Without enough spirituality, it's difficult for your avatar to descend ... It seems that you're prepared. If you can sweep through the world and kill a large number of cultivators, you can descend. If you can't ... Many of your Outlander cultivators will die. These powerful cultivators all have spirituality, and you can take the opportunity to descend. An Overlord is an Overlord.
