The second-generation heir ... Was really too ... Devastating!The long sword struck out!At the same time, yueshen's original body once again burst out with an extremely powerful force that suppressed heaven and earth. She suppressed the red shadow again, and the red shadow punched out, shattering the sky and earth!It was meant to deal with Li Hao, but the situation had changed so much that it seemed like fate was playing a joke on them. Li Hao and the other party, who had been about to kill each other a moment ago, instantly cooperated.Boom! Boom! Boom!The second doppelganger was suppressed and the long sword pierced through it. Time stopped and the second doppelganger of Red Moon Emperor roared,""Bastard! Damn it! You ants dare to kill a venerable sovereign's clone!"BOOM!The huge red shadow exploded and countless Red Moon Power spread in all directions. Red Moon sovereign's voice was cold,""Since you killed the venerable sovereign's clone, I'll turn the world into a land of Red Moon!"At this moment, the boundless energy began to sweep across the entire world, about to envelop the world and turn it into a land shrouded by the Crimson Moon.Frowning, Li Hao was about to attack again when a chaotic River suddenly appeared and covered the entire world. The power of the Crimson Moon was devoured, and in the blink of an eye, countless Thunderbolts of the great Dao were released!Wisps of the Crimson Moon's power were instantly shattered!One after another!As for Li Hao himself, his expression changed slightly. He suddenly disappeared and reappeared in the river. In the sky, the moon god did not participate again. Instead, he looked at the Queen with a cold look in his eyes. The huge moon directly descended and suppressed the Queen!This woman was useless!Time and time again!If the Queen hadn't sabotaged his plan, he wouldn't have had to do this at all. His half-round of original body wouldn't have been wasted. Instead, he would have severely injured Li Hao!Of course, for Li Hao, if it were not for the Queen's interference and the fact that he had not summoned Red Moon Emperor's clone, he might have backtracked to the moon goddess's main body through the half-moon and found a way to kill her!Now, no one would benefit from this.At this moment, the Queen also felt an incomparable sense of danger, as well as everyone's disdain!She was also furious!It was you who treated me as a chess piece ... Do you really want this King to be a chess piece for the rest of my life?Bastard! Yueshen's main body was about to crush her to death. Clearly, she also felt that she was useless and that staying behind would only bring trouble."You all ... Do you really think that this King doesn't know anything?"The Queen howled. The next moment, she suddenly let out a mournful roar,""All the faith in the world, gather in my body!""Believers of the divine Kingdom, burn yourself and offer your life!"At this moment, in the Western land, countless people suddenly floated in the air with a pious expression. They suddenly burned themselves and muttered,""The God of heaven descends to the world. Burn my body, light up the world, burn my body, the God descends to the world!"In an instant, the divine Kingdom exploded with power of faith and began to burn, and a powerful energy surged into the Queen's body. "Hmph!" The Queen snorted coldly."This King has been in control of the divine Kingdom for so long ... Do you really think it's yours?"In an instant, she, who had just been seriously injured, recovered and her aura rose greatly.Not far away, Li Hao took a look ... He was a little surprised and a little strange. It was really ... F * cking interesting!The Queen actually had something up her sleeve!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The next moment, his teeth hurt again.At this moment, Hong Yitang's voice rang in his ears.""What do we do? She suddenly burned the power of faith of the entire Holy Kingdom. If Hong Xiu is really the moon god's clone, does that mean ... She has no faith to use?"“……”Li Hao was also speechless.How would I know!"How would I have known? I had planned everything out, but the Queen jumped out and the other party jumped out of the chessboard. I played a new trick. I didn't expect it, and Li daoheng probably didn't expect it either.Who knew that the stupid Queen would still have a trick up her sleeve and would really let Scandinavia continue to believe in her!He had thought that after several failures and Li Hao's capture, the faith in the divine Kingdom would have long collapsed. Who knew that there really were a large number of death Warriors willing to continue following this Queen ... Can you believe it?In an instant, the Queen's aura surged, her scepter appeared, and suddenly, a big sun appeared above her head!"Hmph!"The Queen snorted coldly,"I am a God!" The sun is in the sky, what's the moon?"BOOM!A boundless aura instantly erupted, causing the heavens and earth to rumble. The moon goddess 'true body was instantly struck by the scepter!At this moment, Li Hao did not say anything. The river of chaos surrounded the entire world and suppressed and devoured the power of the Crimson Moon.Yueshen was caught off guard by this attack.With a bang, the sound of an explosion reverberated through the world!The Queen's attack hit its target, which was a great advantage. Half of the Silver Moon was shattered. Just as Li Hao was thinking about what to do next, the Queen suddenly disappeared, turning into a ray of sunlight and dissipating."Li Hao, this King has killed those traitors! I'll leave this guy to you!"She even learned to run. She disappeared in an instant and rushed toward the Prophet God and the others in the distance. The so-called traitors ... Referred to these gods. In fact, they were all the moon God's people and could not be considered traitors.Li Hao smiled and instantly appeared. He didn't say much, even though there were some changes to his plan.However, the moon goddess herself was injured by the Queen and is staying here ... I don't need to be polite.At this moment, yueshen's cold face finally showed some anger and annoyance. She couldn't hold it in anymore and shouted,""Bastard!"

Chapter 2441 Great Wisdom Appears To Be Foolish?
Everything the second generation had was given to him.Today, however, he was played by the other party.In an instant, all the faith in the God nation was burned. If he had known this would happen ... He would have killed her long ago!In the distance, the fleeing Queen went straight to the Prophet God with a sneer."Prophet God, can you predict the present?"As soon as he finished speaking, the scepter fell, and the sky fell and the earth cracked!The Prophet showed a bitter expression. He did not expect that in everyone's eyes, the Queen was a synonym for failure and a symbol of stupidity. As a result, she really did have some hidden arrangements.Although she said that Hong Xiu was controlling the divine Kingdom, in fact, this woman had been doing a lot of things recently.Otherwise, after the divine Kingdom had been broken through and their faith had collapsed, how many people would still believe in her? this woman would probably have used many other methods.That was why hundreds of thousands of believers burned themselves and their faith to help her.He was also a ruthless person!As the scepter was thrown out, boundless power swept down. At the same time, the other gods 'faces changed drastically. They quickly gathered together and wanted to resist, but at this moment ...Suddenly, heaven's will swept in all directions!In an instant, a huge sun appeared above the Queen's Head, and at this moment, waves of heaven's will swept over madly. The Queen's aura became powerful again, and the scepter seemed to control the entire world!The Prophet God, who was about to escape, changed his expression and instantly had a bad feeling.There was a loud bang!Heaven and earth crumbled as the Queen shattered him with a single strike. Heaven and earth shifted, and the other gods appeared instantly, but they were shattered by her staff one after another!Li Hao's sword struck out, causing the moon goddess to groan in pain. He turned his head to look ... And was stunned for a moment."The will of the heavens ... Is on you?"You've hidden it so deeply!When did the Queen take away heaven's will?In the distance, the Queen killed several gods with her staff. Seeing Li Hao turn around and look at her, she shouted,""You want to let that guy go? Kill her!"As for the Heaven's Will, it was on him ...The Queen felt that it was only natural, wasn't it?In this era, Li Hao was no longer needed. The Dali King had a venerable sovereign's clone, and everyone in the world thought that she was stupid ... But in fact, she was also born in accordance with heaven's will.Ying Hongyue was dead. She was originally a tool used by the moon goddesses to capture heaven's will, so she was the most suitable to contain heaven's will.The will of the heavens ... Is with me, what's so strange about that?In fact, she was the same age as Li Hao. They were both born in accordance with heaven's will. She had been defeated several times before, and Li Hao had taken away heaven's will. Later, Li Hao had given up on himself, which angered heaven's will. Who else was more suitable for heaven's will than her?At this moment, the Queen's aura continued to rise, and it was not any weaker than before. She took the opportunity to blow up Silvermoon's original body and burned her power of faith, completely breaking free from everyone's control!Taking advantage of this opportunity, she completed her plan before Li Hao could even start his plan! The Queen killed the gods with a few scepters.He looked up at the sky, at the man with the sword on his back, at Zheng Yu and the others ... And snorted.""You want to control this King? wishful thinking! After all the scheming ... This King still managed to break free!"At this moment, in the void Dao universe, Zheng Yu and the others looked at each other and laughed."This is interesting ..." Zheng Yu sighed."Li daoheng, it seems like changes are better than plans!"Li Hao had not done anything yet.The Queen of the West was the first to complete her plan, completely breaking free from the control of the Silver Moon and blowing up the Silver Moon's avatar. More importantly, she had borrowed the power of the red moon Emperor. Now, it seemed that she was not really stupid, but on purpose.She knew that these people would not allow the two clones to merge. Therefore, she took this opportunity to kill both silver Moon and red Moon Emperor.And she ... Had succeeded!Otherwise, it wouldn't be that easy to escape.Also, this woman had captured the Heaven's Will long ago. Perhaps the Heaven's Will had always been with her. The ninth Prince was just a puppet of the Heaven's Will.  Read Latest Chapters atŌĆŗ ’ĮÄ0’Į¢’Įģ’Įī’Įé’Įē’ĮÄ This person was the only one chosen by heaven's will.ŌĆ”ŌĆ”Li Hao laughed.He wasn't angry!He only felt that ... He had been hunting geese all day, but today, he had been pecked blind.I was wrong!Of course, it was not a loss to him, but since heaven's will had been captured by the Queen ... He would have to get rid of this woman first. For now, he would Kill the Moon goddess first!After all the scheming ... He didn't think much of letting someone else take the initiative. This was how the plan was. It couldn't be completely according to one's heart.It could only be said that the Queen's bad luck was actually all fake.To her, it was good luck. It seemed that she had really underestimated the other party. The other party's good luck was naturally the bad luck of others. This was the will of heaven!And the Heaven's Will indeed had no better choice!Choosing the Queen would be the best result because she was very strong and talented. She had an advantage over anyone.At this moment, Li Hao slashed out with his sword, and the sky collapsed and the earth cracked!Winding river!Yueshen's expression turned ugly. At this moment, the void above her suddenly shattered and the void Dao universe descended. An entrance appeared. Clearly, yueshen wanted to escape.She was certain that Li Hao did not dare to Enter the Void Dao universe.Even if the universe hadn't completely covered the area and the half-emperors couldn't come out, Li Hao didn't dare to do anything.

Chapter 2442 Great Wisdom Appears To Be Slow?
Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows. He had expected this result.If the other party were to escape again ... It would be fine.Just as he was thinking about this, a huge sun suddenly appeared again. The Queen who had escaped suddenly returned. This time, heaven's will fluctuated above the huge sun!Landslide and tsunami!Heaven and earth swept in all directions, heaven's will fluctuated, and bad luck descended. At this moment, the entrance to the great path universe shifted a little. Not only that, the Queen snorted coldly and gritted her teeth."Go to hell, you old hag. Who do you want to control?""Is this King that easy to bully?"BOOM!A huge sun instantly shattered, shattering the heavens and the earth. Not only that, at this moment, the Heaven's Will transformed into a huge face, as though it was a little unexpected. The Queen gritted her teeth, and suddenly, the Heaven's Will began to fluctuate violently!Trapped in the half-broken sun, the Queen roared,""Li Hao, if you kill Tianyi, I'll take the moon goddess!"Li Hao was really stunned this time!Right at this moment, he was in disbelief. He was at a loss as he slashed towards the huge sun. The Heaven's Will fluctuated violently and suddenly sent out a will of heaven and earth,""Why?"The Heaven's Will has entered your body and helped you succeed. Why ... Are you abandoning me now?The Queen did not say a word!Why?In order to survive!In order to break free from everything!She was going straight for the moon goddess. She wanted to devour the moon goddess and give up on the Heaven's Will. She wanted to improve her strength again. If the Heaven's Will was killed by Li Hao, she would be able to avoid Li Hao's attacks, the moon goddess 'control, and the Heaven's Will's control ...Why?Of course, it was to free himself!Who can control this King?Sure enough, Li Hao was a little surprised at this moment, but he laughed instead. An extremely powerful aura burst out of his longsword as he slashed at the Heaven's Will. The river of chaos surrounded the incomplete Grand Sun!As for the Queen, she appeared in an instant and charged at yueshen. A monstrous force exploded and shattered yueshen with a strike of her staff. She swallowed her whole and was no longer as stupid and cute as she usually was!After devouring half of the moon, the scepter struck madly, and the moon goddess herself appeared with a cold and angry look.""You dare ...""Idiot!"This time, the Queen laughed coldly.An even more powerful force erupted, and the scepter directly smashed the other party's head."So what if she's a Moon Goddess? Are gods that great?"I'm not afraid of you!I'll devour you!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  'Swallow you without the trap, and not the broken Half Moon from before.'BOOM!p Explosions rang out again. At this moment, Li Hao's sword came one after another not far away. Heaven's will roared, shaking the surroundings. Heaven's will turned into a big face, and a small sword even appeared in its mouth. It didn't look at Li Hao, but at the Queen."You have a chance to become the master of the Silver Moon ... You actually ... Damn ... Stupid ..."Everyone was calling her stupid, but the Queen was sneering!I'm stupid?You're all idiots!BOOM!The scepter had almost destroyed the moon goddess completely. She opened her mouth and devoured the Silver Moon Power again. In the distance, the man with the sword on his back seemed to be walking out, but the Queen did not care!At this moment, a bright moon appeared above his head again!"Today ... This King is the true God!"She looked up at the sky. The next moment, the moon above her head covered the entire moon god. BOOM! The sound of explosions was endless!Not far away, the Heaven's Will shook! It roared violently, but it was also cut into pieces by Li Hao. Not only that, the two rivers of chaos and time madly washed the world, trying to kill the will of heaven!The entire Silver Moon sky seemed to be about to explode!After an unknown amount of time, BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world.Boom! Boom! Boom!A rain of blood suddenly fell from the sky. At this moment, it was raining cats and dogs. Li Hao did not kill heaven's will, but at this moment, a huge star in the void Dao universe suddenly exploded!The moon goddess had fallen!The sword-carrying man turned his head and looked over with a little shock and confusion. The moon goddess's Natal star was here. Logically speaking, even if she was killed, only her physical body would die. How could her true body completely die?The Heaven's Will was not completely dead yet!Before Li Hao could kill Tianyi, the moon goddess had been killed by the Queen!On the other side, the Queen was madly devouring the endless power of the Silver Moon, as if she had eaten her fill. She had a smug look on her face, and at this moment, it was as if she had returned to the past. She laughed foolishly and arrogantly."The world only needs one God! I've devoured her and obtained the moon god's bloodline. I'll just detonate my own star. I'm her and she's me. After all these years, they've become one. Li daoheng, didn't you think of this? You're refining me as a clone ... This King's clone will replace the true venerated!"BOOM!Her body trembled a little and she kept spitting out blood. It was obvious that this was caused by the explosion of her Natal star. However, she started laughing wildly!I won!A bright moon floated in the sky and instantly disappeared into the depths of the world. The Queen's voice rang out,""Li Hao, I don't owe you anything. I killed the moon goddesses, and you killed the heavens" will. The only God!"BOOM!At this moment, the Heaven's Will collapsed, and the small sword broke. Countless forces swept across the world and were swallowed by Li Hao's River!In all directions, heaven and earth seemed to have shattered. A large amount of blood rain poured down, mixed with countless energy and sorrow. The will of heaven ... Was actually killed by a stupid woman!Everyone else was just a puppet of the Heaven's Will, but the Queen was the only one that the Heaven's Will truly wanted to join forces with, merge with, and become one with.In the end ... The Queen abandoned it, swallowed the broken Moon, and did not choose to merge with it.……"Wonderful!"At this moment, in the North, Tian Ji shouted in a low voice, grabbed the Dali King, and punched his head. He was beaming with joy."What a powerful character! He destroyed the waning moon, abandoned the will of heaven, got into Li Hao's good books, dealt with li daoheng's backup plan, killed the moon goddess, and replaced her ... To become the only God in the world! This stupid woman ... No, this powerful woman has turned the tables. You're the stupidest one!"Even Heaven's Fate was shocked by the Queen's actions.The king of Dali was also dumbfounded. He muttered,""She ... She's doing this ... Won't she be thoroughly offending li daoheng?"Bang! Bang!After punching his head, Heaven's Fate gritted his teeth.""Idiot, we're mortal enemies! He had used her as a tool to gather heaven's will, and the moon goddess had used her as a storage container to distribute energy. In the end, the tool had turned the tables, and you still didn't understand? mortal enemy ... She just had to avoid offending Li Hao. If he Lost heaven's will and took the moon goddess away, Li Hao wouldn't even say a word ... And he would even have to praise him for doing a good job! You're still thinking about who you've offended!"The Dali King came back to his senses, nodded, and muttered,""This woman ... Isn't she very stupid?"He had suddenly turned the tables!This time, he suddenly felt that he was the only one who had yet to turn the tables!……At this moment, a rain of blood was pouring down. In Li Hao's spiritual world, a large number of stars began to merge. A part of the will of heaven that had been killed was captured by him and absorbed by the three saints!A part of it was swallowed by the river of chaos, which was Hong Yitang!Li Hao looked into the distance. A bright moon was rapidly escaping ... Li Hao muttered,""I've underestimated the people of the world!"The Queen, who he had always thought was a pig-like teammate ... Was actually the first to break free from the chessboard this time, Kill the Moon goddess, and destroy the heavens 'will. This woman couldn't have been putting on an act with him, right?Hong Yitang's voice slowly sounded in his ears,""Has the Heaven's Will completely died?"A rain of blood poured down. It looked like he had completely fallen.Li Hao replied,"No. As long as the world is still around, it hasn't been completely destroyed ... It still has a chance to rise from the ashes. Its main force won't be wiped out. It's almost impossible for it to turn the tables. I didn't expect that it would be screwed over by the Queen!"As expected ... Whoever worked with the Queen would die!

Chapter 2443 You're Done Singing, I'll Take The Stage (1)
The heavens and earth were turned upside down.The Queen's Move was beyond everyone's expectations.The moon goddess was killed, the Heaven's Will was shattered, and the Queen was completely freed. Even Li Hao was trapped in it and became her helper. The red moon sovereign was also trapped in this situation and lost a clone for nothing.As for the Queen herself, her strength was not damaged.Previously, he was close to the late Heavenly King stage. Now that he had completely devoured the moon goddess, his strength was about the same. His strength did not improve, but the result was completely different.Before this, all the strength was someone else 's.It could be taken away at any time.But now ... Things were different.Replace it with a clone!Li Hao's plan was ruined. He had thought that if Hong Xiu was really the moon god's avatar, she could use the river of time to kill the past and the future, and her avatar would replace her.p In the end ... The Queen was one step ahead!At this moment, the Queen had fled after reaping all the benefits, and everyone's attention was on Li Hao again.It couldn't be helped. On Li Hao's side, the commotion was much bigger than the Queen 's.The point was that even if the Queen was free, she couldn't cause any fatal damage to the half-emperors and venerable sovereigns. It could only be said that she was a small fish that had jumped out of the pond, so it didn't matter.But Li Hao couldn't just ignore it.At this moment, Li Hao had actually gained some benefits, but not too much. Whether it was the will of heaven or the avatar of the red moon Emperor, he had given the main energy to the river of chaos, which was actually Hong Yitang.Li Hao had only absorbed a small part of it.At this moment, he was also continuously fusing stars in the battle, causing the commotion to become increasingly greater. It was almost impossible to cover it up. The Queen's previous battle had actually helped Li Hao cover it up a little.But now, with the Queen gone ... It was hard to hide.Void Dao universe.The man with the sword on his back watched silently. Suddenly, he turned to look at Zheng Yu. This time, he had suffered a great loss. Even the moon goddesses had been killed. They were the key to his devouring of the world, but in the end, they had been killed by the Queen.Zheng Yu said to go all out ... Was he going all out?Where are your men?  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  For so many years, the two of them had been plotting in Silver Moon. Although their main targets were venerable sovereigns and monarchs, did they really not have any tricks up their sleeves to deal with Li Hao?Seeing this, Zheng Yu shook his head and said,'it won't be of much use if there's someone obstructing us now! You should think of a way to descend to the Silver Moon first. "As Zheng Yu spoke, he looked at Li Hao and the river of chaos again. Frowning, he said,""The river of chaos and the river of time ... Why did Li Hao deliberately separate them?""Isn't it better to use time to control the primordial chaos?"With some doubt, he said softly,""Also, what exactly happened to the chaos lightning tribulation? just by devouring the Silver Moon world, the chaos lightning tribulation was created?"He muttered a few words. Not far away, the red moon Emperor's clone had also recovered from the previous unhappiness and said coldly,""The two of you are known as the Silver Moon Duo Masters. You're good at scheming against me, but you're repeatedly defeated by Li Hao and that moon god puppet. You're truly useless!"Zheng Yu chuckled."Venerable sovereigns are too strong. The strong will only scheme against the strong. What's the point of scheming against the weak?" Who would target a group of ants ... Even if the ants were extremely strong, they were still ants! Before these ants rose up, could you imagine that ants could swallow an elephant?"Scheming against the strong was a necessary cultivation, and also a pleasure.But to scheme against the weak ... If he had the strength, he could just kill the other party directly. Why would he scheme?These words were also the truth.The two of them rarely set up traps for the weak. Even if they did, they did so not to scheme against the younger generation like Li Hao, but to deal with heaven's will, to prove their Dao and become emperors, and to deal with venerable sovereigns ...He was not targeting weaklings like Li Hao.In the end, this group of weaklings kept jumping out of the chessboard, which could be considered a provocation and a blow to them.While they were talking, Li Hao's aura suddenly grew stronger in the distance.The dark clouds of thunder and lightning above his head almost covered the entire world!Red Moon sovereign frowned and thought,'this guy is not just swallowing the land! If we don't descend soon, there might be a problem!"At this moment, the three of them were not blind.They could all see it!As for the Queen, no one cared about her.Even if the Queen reached the late Heavenly King stage ... It was nothing. On the other hand, Li Hao, although his realm was not high, his battle strength was not weak. Once he gained something this time, he might really be able to fight against a pseudo-Emperor!With another opponent all of a sudden ... It would not be easy to handle."Just a moment more will do!"The sword-bearing man glanced at the sky and thought,'the primal Chaos lightning tribulation hasn't arrived yet, which means that he hasn't succeeded yet! There's still time!"There was still time!The two remaining people didn't say anything and just watched silently.……At this moment, Li Hao's spiritual sea was rolling crazily.At this moment, he had already fused almost 100 stars. There was still a long way to go before he succeeded. Li Hao frowned and looked around.Those people didn't try to delay him anymore.It was actually a good thing to send people to delay.On the one hand, he could conceal his movements, and on the other hand, he could kill a few troublesome characters to prevent any hidden dangers in the future. But now ... If the other party didn't care anymore, it might not be a good thing.Right now, three experts were floating in the air, silently looking at him. In truth, this was even more stressful.Once the void Dao universe descended, it would definitely face a thunderous attack.

Chapter 2444 You're Done Singing, I'll Take The Stage (2)
He could also tell that li daoheng was currently descending on the void Dao universe, and it would not be too long."They might have been preparing to descend a long time ago!"Li Hao mumbled. Otherwise, the enemy would have arrived at the very beginning. It was too fast.Of course, even if The Phantom Dao universe did not descend, once Li Hao started, the other party might appear in the world soon. With the death of heaven's will and the death of the moon goddess, the entire world was shaking violently.Countless amounts of energy seeped out and filled the entire Silver Moon.If this continued, perhaps it wouldn't be long before heaven and earth could accommodate a half-step sovereign.……Time slowly passed.A part of the universe was about to completely descend upon the human world.At this moment, in the void Dao universe, Zheng Yu suddenly said,""I might have noticed something. Li Hao might be using his fake Dao universe to merge with the real Dao universe ... That fake Dao universe feels like the void Dao universe, merging reality with reality. Li daoheng, do you think my judgment is right?""It's possible!"At this moment, li daoheng's voice came from the void. He somewhat agreed with this speculation."The fusion of reality and illusion, one true and one false ... The real river of chaos and some false rivers of time split into two. Is it for the fusion?""It's very possible!"As the two of them were talking, Red Moon sovereign's eyes flickered."Will this succeed?"Zheng Yu said,'it's hard to say, the fake Dao universe is too weak, but the true Dao universe is very strong! It's reasonable to say that it's easy for an imbalance to occur between the strong and the weak, and it might even cause him to explode. Perhaps he has other means ... Such as ..."He looked into the distance, into the depths of the universe.""The time star might appear!"At this moment, the three of them were moved.Zheng Yu didn't say anything more. He just looked into the distance in silence, then at Li Hao below, and finally at the North. His eyes became more and more deep.Things were getting more and more interesting!If the time star really appeared ... Could he catch it this time?……BOOM!Heaven and earth trembled, and lightning burst out. Vaguely, some lightning had already begun to descend, but they were very weak and did not attack Li Hao. They seemed to be accumulating power, causing a part of the power to overflow in the void.The sky exploded!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  At this moment, even the Queen, who had escaped, was silently observing from a distance. While absorbing the energy of the moon goddess, she watched Li Hao's movements and fell into deep thought.Can Li Hao ... Fight against a pseudo-Emperor this time?She and Li Hao weren't partners.However, Li Hao was now the shield.Once Li Hao was defeated, she wouldn't be any better off. These Silver Moon Warriors were essentially one.If Li Hao couldn't stop this crisis, she would soon fall into a new one even if she managed to escape. While the Queen was deep in thought, Li Hao's aura grew stronger and stronger.It was as if there were giant Dragons coiling around him!Li Hao once again returned to the silver Blizzard city. He looked at the sky with a grave expression. Soon, not because he was about to succeed, but because ... The void Dao universe was about to descend.What a coincidence!Before he could succeed, the other party had arrived ... This timing might also be a test, a test of heaven and earth, a test of chaos, or even a tribulation in itself!The fake great Dao universe began to merge. This was already heaven-defying.This time, it would depend on whether he had any hope of turning the situation around.As Li Hao thought to himself, he looked at the three people in the sky ... His expression was somewhat dark. Li daoheng ... Seemed to be a little worse than he had expected, but Zheng Yu had not revealed anything from the beginning to the end.On the contrary, Li Hao became even more wary!Zheng Yu ... This seemingly foolish fellow had suffered losses at Li Hao's hands time and time again. Not only that, Li Hao had lost almost all his assets and entered the void Dao universe alone. This pseudo-Emperor ... Apart from his strength, his brain really seemed to be ordinary.But ... Why did he feel that he was a little unfathomable?The Queen, this seemingly stupid woman, was able to set him up. This made Li Hao a little wary. If I were Zheng Yu, what other tricks would I have?Of course, even if there were, there was a high probability that they were not targeting him.It was to target li daoheng and red Moon Emperor.Li Hao also knew that these people wouldn't consider him an imaginary enemy. Their only enemies were the other two.At this moment, Li Hao looked at Zheng Yu.This fellow who had called himself red dust when his clone walked out seemed to have truly seen through the world of mortals. He had killed his second brother and his father ... That fellow seemed to have only been angry for a moment, but he didn't find any trouble with him after that.At this moment, the more he thought about it, the more he felt that it was inappropriate.Don't tell me ... You want me to free him from some restrictions?If that was the case ... He was cruel and terrifying enough.He couldn't care so much anymore. Man proposes, God disposes!He had already done everything he could. If he still failed ... There was nothing he could do.BOOM!His mind seemed to be exploding, and the world seemed to be overturned. The entire world of his spirit sea fluctuated again. There was a violent tremor. In his spirit sea, the 180 stars had been fused to about 140.Li Hao's aura also began to grow stronger. At this moment, his strength had reached the sixth level of Dao integration.As for the sixth level of the Dao integration realm, he would need to open at least 216 meridians just by relying on his corporeal Dao meridians.The sixth level of the Dao integration realm was the peak of the late Heavenly King realm.One more level and he would begin to step into the so-called half-step sovereign realm.

Chapter 2445 You're Done Singing, I'll Take The Stage (3)
Li Hao exhaled slightly. The aura in his body kept increasing, which made him feel a little more at ease.But very quickly, his expression turned serious.Heaven and earth trembled, and it seemed as if a universe was about to descend between heaven and earth.At this moment, three figures with monstrous auras appeared.Red Moon sovereign was eager to try, while Zheng Yu put his hands behind his back and looked indifferent.Li daoheng carried a longsword on his back, and a River of Stars also appeared behind him. Although there were fewer rivers of chaos on Li Hao's side, the stars were also flickering like gods.The three experts stared at Li Hao at the same time, and boundless pressure began to spread.In the seven main cities, everyone felt a suffocating aura.In the distance, Zhang andu's breathing stagnated slightly. He looked up at the sky with a solemn expression. The three half-step sovereigns ... Were about to descend to the human world!Zheng Yu looked at Li Hao from afar and suddenly said,""Li Hao, while we still have some time, there's something that I don't know if I should ask. Or ... Would you be willing to answer my questions?"  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  "Senior Zheng, what do you want to ask?" Li Hao raised his eyebrows.Zheng Yu smiled."I once told you that you can sense a weak origin when you're close to the four poles of heaven and earth. Did you sense it or not?" Is the universe of origin still near the four poles?"Li Hao's eyes flickered. What did he mean?"Senior, you don't know?""No." Zheng Yu shook his head."I've long passed the time when I was comprehending the origin. I've only sensed a weak aura of the origin in the four poles of heaven and earth, but I don't know whether it's a remnant of the past or if the universe of origin really covers the four directions of the Silver Moon. However, when I told you that day, you seemed to have gone to comprehend and connect with the origin. I want to know if you have really come into contact with the origin Dao?"Li Hao's head was spinning madly.What did that mean?Not far away, the red moon sovereign glanced at Zheng Yu and said coldly,""Zheng Yu, you can't possibly think that Silver Moon is still within the range of neo martial, right? Although the great Dao universe was boundless, it actually had a limit! The origin has completely disappeared from Silver Moon, so Silver Moon is clearly no longer within the range of the new martial!""Venerable sovereign, I'm only asking Li Hao, not you!" Zheng Yu laughed. I'm at ease now that the origin isn't around. The venerable sovereign's tribulation won't appear. I've cultivated my entire life, but it's still difficult to pass the Tribulation of a venerable sovereign. I can only see if I can take a shortcut and become a sovereign without passing the Tribulation. " Was it for the venerable sovereign's tribulation?Li Hao thought to himself, but he was not sure. Perhaps ... It was not just for the venerable sovereign's tribulation.What did he want to know?Why didn't he test it out himself?Even if he had passed that period ... There might still be people who could test him.As this thought came to his mind, Li Hao said,"maybe it's still there. It's just that there's a barrier between us. That day, when I comprehended force, I triggered a tremor in the origin Energy. If not for the barrier, perhaps ... I would have stepped into the great Dao of origin!"Zheng Yu fell into deep thought and did not ask further.BOOM!At this moment, heaven and earth trembled.At this moment, the power of the void Dao universe instantly filled the entire world. The three experts were originally illusory, but at this moment, they seemed to have appeared in front of everyone. Three extremely powerful auras swept across the entire Silver Moon! Even the dark clouds in the sky trembled slightly.Countless cultivators could feel the boundless pressure sweeping in all directions.It had descended!The Silver Moon had officially descended in the void Dao universe.……At this moment, in the North, celestial pole's heart stirred.He was in danger!Or rather ... It was almost impossible.What was Li Hao doing? perhaps he had succeeded and could resist the half-step sovereigns, but the other side didn't seem to have succeeded. Now, three half-step sovereigns had arrived. Unless the three of them had an internal strife, Li Hao had no hope at all!Just as he was thinking about this, the Dali King, whose head was full of bumps, suddenly let out a breath, grinned, and disappeared.Heaven's Fate stretched out his hand and wanted to say something.The Dali King's voice could be heard faintly,"senior, even the Queen can jump out ... This King also wants to jump out of this chessboard!" You've always been the players. Aren't you tired of playing chess for a hundred thousand years?""Don't stop me, I'll just die!"The Dali King didn't even turn his head. He was originally very nervous, but now that it had really come to this, he calmed down.Moreover, after seeing the Queen jump out, he was also tempted.I'm not inferior to her!"I didn't stop you!""I just want to say that when the time comes, the bump on your head should disappear on your own, so as not to embarrass yourself!"Heaven's Fate sneered.The Dali King's footsteps halted, and the void trembled.The bump on her head disappeared instantly.The next moment, the Dali King disappeared completely. Beside him, Jiang Li looked worried. Tian Ji said lightly,""We each have our own paths, what are you worried about? In an era, there would always be someone who would rise! If he seized the opportunity, it would be an opportunity. If he didn't ... It would be death! There are many new martial artists who have achieved success and many have risen, but many people have died in the process. The survivors are biased, and everyone feels that they will become that small group ... The result is hard to say!""Of course, if I don't fight, I won't have any chance at all!""Oh my God!" Jiang Li was a little uneasy."My Lord ... Is too weak.""He's a Heavenly King ... Why is he too weak?"Tian Ji said indifferently,"he's walking the path of beginner martial arts and strengthening his body. Logically speaking, he's not weak. Those people don't have an origin. As long as Li Hao has some means, he might not be much weaker than a pseudo-Emperor!"Even though he said that, he still frowned slightly.Even if ... He really did have some tricks up his sleeve, would a single king of Dali be of any use?

Chapter 2446 You Sing, I'll Take The Stage (3)
What about me?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.……At this moment, the three experts had completely descended into the human world.At the same time, a long river floated between heaven and earth. Li Hao knew that it was unavoidable, so he stopped thinking about it. The river had appeared at the checkpoint because time was limited. The future was illusory, and it had come too early. Perhaps King Dali and the others would not be able to hold on for long.The river appeared.At this moment, a man walked out of the main city with a long sword in his hand.Lin Hongyu walked out, floated in the air, and stepped into the river. She looked at Li Hao and the three half-step sovereigns and chuckled."It's my honor to participate in such a high-end battle!""I have a past, but I don't know the future! However, I firmly believe that only the Silver Moon people can control the Silver Moon world! My husband controls heaven and earth, so I will definitely have a future ... The future is unpredictable, and out of a million possibilities, there will always be one that the Silvermoon people will win!"A long sword appeared in the sky, giving off boundless light!"Lin Hongyu, use the stream sword to connect the future and carry my body!"Time reversed and the world became still. The long river surged and waves rolled. At this moment, in the endless void, the sound of water could be heard. The sound of water flowing was like that of a small stream, and the crisp sound reverberated through the world.The three half-step sovereigns had just come into contact with the mortal world, and the void seemed to have frozen.At this moment, time seemed to have stopped. The three half-step sovereigns could vaguely sense something different. The current river of time seemed to be stronger than before!"The human king's sword ..."Zheng Yu muttered.At that moment, a person seemed to walk out from the end of the river in the distance. He carried with him a boundless aura of death, as if he had come from hell. Lin Hongyu looked at him silently and was a little lost.A dead person?Yes, at this moment, it was as if a dead man had walked out from the future and crawled out of hell.The aura of death around him was suffocating.She was no longer as beautiful as she was now. There was only boundless coldness and death. It was as if she had really died in the future. At this moment, she was walking out from the endless abyss, step by step, crossing time and space to come here.I'm dead?Lin Hongyu looked at the future figure with an indescribable feeling. 'I'm dead ... And I can still walk out of it?'Li Hao, who was merging the Dao meridians, turned his head and was a little lost.Was she dead?The future her ... Was also killed?Even though he knew that it was just one of the many possibilities, Lin Hongyu's death ... What did that mean?Was I defeated in that future?Also, the dead Lin Hongyu was able to walk out of it ... What did this mean?While he was in a daze, the river surged and a voice shook the world,""I will use the fist of tyrant to lure my future self! The Silvermoon people of the Silvermoon world are the true rulers of the world!"  A domineering man appeared with two fists in his hands.At this moment, his fists were glowing.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  A huge wave rose up in a long river!On the gloves, there was even a vague shadow that appeared. It was overbearing, but this shadow was not the future body of the Dali King. At the end of the long river, a person seemed to want to walk out, but no figure appeared.The king of Dali was stunned for a moment, and then he suddenly laughed at himself."This King ... Doesn't even have a future?"At least Lin Hongyu had a death form!And I don't even have a future?It was so ironic!'It looks like I'm going to die early, or maybe I'm going to die today. So, I don't even have a future!'It was too ironic!The Dali King laughed. The next moment, he suddenly punched the river with both fists and roared,""So what if there's no future? The power to draw it over!"BOOM!The long river was surging, and the sky and earth were cracking. At this moment, a shadow slowly emerged above his fists. The Dali King's eyes were cold and sharp."Since I don't have a future ... I'll fight for one myself! Whether it's celestial ruler BA or Supreme Emperor tie ... Merge with my body and I'll be my own future!"BOOM!A shadow completely emerged. In an instant, it followed the giant fist and instantly integrated into the body of Dali King. A domineering and unparalleled aura shook the entire world in the blink of an eye!Lin Hongyu took a step forward and walked along the long sword. She came into contact with the dead body.The frosty aura caused her body to crack open as her life force seemed to be sucked out. When the body of death merged into her, Lin Hongyu laughed."Walking out of hell and killing a half-step sovereign ... It doesn't seem like a loss!"The auras of the two of them instantly exploded.In the blink of an eye, he was extremely powerful!However, it was a little superficial.And at this moment, everyone was incomparably shocked. Was this even possible?The two rivers of time instantly disappeared, as if they had never appeared. Not far away, Li Hao's face was pale, and the power of time on his body seemed to have dissipated.Not only that, but Li Hao suddenly seemed to have aged.Without the replenishment of the river of chaos and the power of ten thousand DAOs, every time he used the power of time, his lifespan would be consumed. In the blink of an eye, Li Hao became old.At this moment, everyone was stunned.Even Zheng Yu and the others were slightly taken aback. They looked at Li Hao. The current Li Hao seemed ... Seemed like the future Li Hao they had seen last time!It seemed like it!Be it Lin Hongyu or the king of Dali, their auras were strong, but three half-step sovereigns, why would they be afraid?However, Li Hao ... Seemed to have experienced the vicissitudes of life. He was almost ... Not much different from the future Li Hao He saw last time. Could it be ... That the future Li Hao fused with last time was not too far away, but today?

2447 Chapter 408
The river of chaos was now surrounding Li Hao.Hong Yitang's heart skipped a beat.He knew something about the situation!There was bound to be a Great Tribulation in the future. He had thought that it would happen after Li Hao became a pseudo-Emperor ... But the Li Hao today was too similar to that day. In that case ... Perhaps it would happen today?Moreover, if he succeeded today, Li Hao might also be able to ascend to the position of a half-Emperor.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  It was just that ... Li Hao hadn't mastered the thousand swords yet. It seemed to be a little different from that time, but the future ... Was not fixed. Was it this time?If not ... Li Hao might lose his strength at the critical moment!The three half-step sovereigns also woke up. Red Moon sovereign looked at them and sighed,""Amazing, good move! Take it and draw it into the future ... However, the power seems to be too superficial. Furthermore, it seems that the drawbacks are not small. Of course, it is also very terrifying!""It seems like this is going to be more interesting and more difficult than I expected!" He smiled.In the next moment, he teleported and disappeared. He didn't go to the celestial pole!Instead, he appeared above an ancient city in an instant. He didn't want to go to the Heaven's Fate right now. Instead, he wanted to try to break through the eight major cities. Perhaps his true body would come out directly.If that was the case ... Why would he go find that half-Emperor avatar to fight?Li Hao didn't say anything.In an instant ... Lin Hongyu, King Dali, Zheng Yu, and Li daoheng appeared above the ancient city at the same time. They stared at Red Moon sovereign from all directions.Red Moon sovereign's expression changed slightly and he was a little angry."What ... Are you doing?"Zheng Yu said softly,"venerable sovereign, I think you'd better go and play with the one in the North first. Even if you don't fight, even if you're just there to join in the fun, it's better to have a chat. It's better than staying here!" Venerable sovereign ... What do you think?"Not far away, Li Hao was silent.He just continued to merge the Dao meridians.He was not worried that the eight main cities would be breached. At least, no one hoped that a venerable sovereign would really come out at this moment. In that case, he should not be the one who should be anxious.Red Moon sovereign's face turned ugly.He had thought that he would have a chance with the appearance of two powerful experts who could summon the past and the future. In the end ... None of these people were good people. They wouldn't allow him to free his true body!Of course, this was actually within reason.However, he was still unwilling to give up. He said coldly,""Lin Hongyu, King of the Li Dynasty ... Think carefully. Your powers are weak and you are no match for these two. Once I step out ... These two will be my opponents! As long as you delay them for a while and take the initiative to release the seals on the eight major cities ... Perhaps you'll be the ones who benefit from this!"He looked at Li Hao.Li Hao opened his sharp eyes and looked at Red Moon sovereign."If the venerable sovereign doesn't want to get involved, then stay away and watch the show! If you want to get involved, it doesn't matter if you kill me or them, just make a choice! If the venerable sovereign wants to come out with his true body, it's better to wait until we determine the winner or the venerable sovereign becomes the fisherman!"Red Moon sovereign looked around and suddenly sneered,""Interesting! Li Hao ... You're really arrogant. You're expecting two half-step sovereigns to contend with two veteran half-step sovereigns who are only one step away from becoming venerable sovereigns ... It seems like your brain isn't working well!" He didn't even need to defeat the two of them. As long as he waited, their powers would disappear.Li Hao, do you really expect them to stop Zheng Yu's group?Or did he think that he could resist two half-step sovereigns at this time?Red Moon sovereign sneered and disappeared again. The void fluctuated as he headed north.Since the four powerhouses didn't allow him to attack the city, he would just avoid them first!When he went to the North, he didn't go directly to the celestial pole ... Perhaps there would soon be a result here, and there was no need to go to the celestial pole. If these people were to suffer losses on both sides, why would they go to the celestial pole?They would directly take down eight cities!In the North, Tian Ji just watched silently. He knew that if Red Moon sovereign wanted to break out of the seal, he had to break through the eight cities and eight meridians first. His bloody blade would be the key.It was just that ... The other party did not come to find him, and he did not care about the other party.If Red Moon sovereign did not make a move, he would not take the initiative to care about him.Besides ... It was only a clone, so what could he do even if he killed it?……Four powerful auras instantly erupted.The king of Dali could not wait any longer. He felt his own power, boundless power. At this moment, he felt that he could even defeat a venerable sovereign!Hence, he did not hold back at all. Of the four powerhouses, he was the first to launch an attack!His fists broke through the sky!She went straight for Zheng Yu and did not go for li daoheng. Li daoheng was a swordsman. Lin Hongyu used a saber, but she was using the human Queen's sword to guide her. She was skilled in both the saber and the sword, so it was better for her to deal with li daoheng.He would leave Zheng Yu to him!With one punch, heaven and earth were broken!The void seemed to shatter in an instant, and the Dali king only felt that this punch was unimaginably powerful!BOOM!The loud boom and explosion even made the Dali King have the illusion that Zheng Yu would die with this punch!What Queen, what Moon Goddess, what Li Hao ... No one would be able to block this punch!The influence that those people had on him previously had also disappeared in an instant.Boom! Boom! Boom!The void exploded, and King Dali was still ecstatic. The next moment, his expression changed. He turned around and punched. Zheng Yu's figure was no longer in the collapsed void in front of him. He appeared on his right.

Chapter 2448 You Sing, I'll Take The Stage (3)_6
At this moment, he only looked at the king of Dali silently.When the king of Dali turned around and threw a punch, Zheng Yu said softly,""It's very powerful! However, the borrowed power is not my own after all. King Dali, if celestial ruler BA or Supreme Emperor tie were here, they could kill me with one punch ... But you ... You are far from that!"With a light wave of his hand, the sound of a nine-section whip could be heard. As the whip lashed out, the void trembled.The shadow of King Dali's fist was instantly shattered!At this moment, the boundless violent aura was broken by the other party's attack. Zheng Yu was like a god and demon. At this moment, it was imprinted in the depths of the Dali King's mind. He smiled and said,""You ... You can 't!"BOOM!The Dali King was directly sent flying. Blood splattered and his qi and blood churned all over his body. Under this whip, a deep blood mark was drawn on his strong body. Even his bones were crushed!The pain was so intense that it went deep into his soul!The Dali King frowned in pain, and his blood splattered out with some disbelief!He felt that his aura wasn't any weaker than the other party 's, but in the end ... He had been defeated by a single whip!How was that possible?As he was defeated, Lin Hongyu, who was like the god of death, shattered the heaven and earth with one strike. On the other side, the sword light was like the sun. With one strike, the heaven and earth collapsed, the sword light dissipated, and the air of death was destroyed!A sword wound appeared on Lin Hongyu's body, but there was no blood flowing out, only a boundless aura of death.Lin Hongyu laughed."I didn't know that ... Dead people have such benefits!" She said.The Dali King turned his head and looked. The next moment, the sound of the whip breaking the void rang in his ears again. He hurriedly rolled, broke through the void, and disappeared. Just as he reappeared, the whip fell on top of his head with a bang!Bang! Bang!His head was bleeding!The incomparably powerful force seemed to have only strengthened the other party's defense. As for the rest ... It didn't seem to have become stronger at all. Facing a true pseudo-Emperor, not only was he unable to attack the other party, he wasn't even able to Dodge his attack!"Li Hao, are these two your backup plans?""A little weak." Zheng Yu chuckled."If that's the case ... You're looking down on us!"These two would have no problem dealing with ordinary peak Heavenly Kings.But who were they?The two most talented and powerful people in Silvermoon world.It was impossible to defeat them by borrowing the power of the past and the future. It seemed difficult to even delay them.At this moment, in the distance, Zhang an's aura changed, and he had vaguely stepped into the Heavenly King level. He stepped out and broke through the void with a serious look. He looked at King Dali and said in a deep voice,""Your strength is too superficial, and you're not good at the great Dao, so how can you defeat him? You focus on defense and block his attacks. I'll fight him!"The Dali King's expression changed slightly. He gritted his teeth and was somewhat angry!I ... Main defense?You're a new Heavenly King, and you might not be as strong as me, who hasn't brought celestial ruler BA over. How are you going to fight him?On the other hand, Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly as he looked at Zhang an.At this moment, a book of great Dao appeared, and the power of great Dao emerged. Zhang an's aura became stronger, and at the same time, a shadow merged into Zhang an's body.A book, a ruler, and a knife appeared in Zhang an's hands.The book covered the sky, the ruler was on the left, and the blade was on the right.He looked at Zheng Yu with a calm expression."I don't have my grandfather's strength, nor do I have their talent. In the early stage of neo martial, I was very mediocre. If it wasn't for my grandfather and the others 'help, I wouldn't even be as good as the mcmau students of that era!"​ "I've learned a lot, but it's a lot and a lot, a lot but not very good ..."He laughed."But I do have some advantages ... I fought alongside the human King and the sword Saint in the universe ... Although I'm still useless, I've seen things you've never seen!"In an instant, the book of Dao filled the world and suppressed everything!The power of countless great DAOs swept over, and Zhang an's aura skyrocketed. He shouted in a low voice,"betraying neo martial, you must be killed!"As the ruler struck down, a long saber instantly appeared. With the ruler at the head, the long saber slew a God!Zheng Yu's eyes flickered, and he lashed out with his whip!However, at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared and grabbed the long whip. Blood instantly flowed out of his arms, but in an instant, the gloves on his hands burst out with a brilliant light and a vibrating force spread out!The king of Dali roared and gritted his teeth,""I can't defeat you, so don't even think about hurting anyone in front of me!"At this moment, he also came back to his senses.In his anger, he had also thought it through. Since he couldn't defeat this guy, then ... He would be a good shield!Damn it! 'I'm ... I'm not even as good as the two women. At least Lin Hongyu can still exchange a few blows with them, but I'm defeated by them in a short time. This is so heartbreaking!'……At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about them.The stars were still merging, and a monstrous aura continued to spread out. The entire heaven and earth was filled with the power of the great Dao. The thunder in the sky began to shake. At this moment, the Thunder seemed to be almost done accumulating power.Vaguely, it was about to descend!Li Hao sighed. Thunder ... Chaos lightning tribulation. This was something he had not expected. After all, he had no experience in this.Strength was still more useful than all kinds of schemes!Lin Hongyu and the others ... Might not be able to hold on until he successfully transcended his tribulation.BOOM!An extremely thick bolt of lightning headed straight for Li Hao. Li Hao disappeared in an instant and reappeared near li daoheng. However, the lightning didn't care about li daoheng or anyone else. Even though it was extremely thick, it was still extremely accurate as it headed straight for Li Hao!BOOM!With the sound of thunder, Li Hao's body cracked.An extremely powerful force exploded. Li Hao's skin and flesh split open. He looked at the sky in disbelief!He, a peak Heavenly King, was almost killed by one strike!More importantly ... He had wanted to use the power of the lightning to divert the disaster, but ... He had failed!At this moment, someone sighed in the distance.""You're thinking too much. What do you think the primal Chaos lightning is? He had read too many novels ... Did he really think that he could implicate others? This is your tribulation ... It's specifically targeted at you. It doesn't matter who it is!"It was the celestial pole's voice!He saw that Li Hao was trying to divert the disaster to another place, so he had to give him a reminder.The Thunderbolts are aimed at you!You ... Don't even think about destroying the enemy with Thunder. If you think that the chaotic Thunder is so easy to deal with, then it's not the chaotic Thunder!At this moment, Li Hao's expression changed.Only targeting me?His lack of experience caused him to make some mistakes in his judgment again. Or rather, almost no one had such experience. On the other hand, Heaven's Fate might have encountered such a situation before because he had lived for a long time.Li Hao had originally thought that since Thunderbolt was so powerful, it might be his trump card.In the end ... It didn't work!"Nine is the foundation of thunderclaps. At least nine times. If it's more ... It can be infinitely many times!" I won't stop until I'm done with you ... Do as you see fit!"BOOM!Instantly, the second Thunderbolt descended. In just an instant, the Silver City completely disappeared, but it didn't involve anyone else. Only Li Hao was struck and disappeared in an instant, as if he had turned into ashes!That powerful strength shocked everyone!How could this be?At this moment, a long river slowly appeared. Li Hao walked out from the end of the river with a pale face. He couldn't believe it. This ... Was too powerful!I'm not even a half-step sovereign. The second strike will definitely have the power of a half-step sovereign!艹!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Why was it like this?If not for the power of time reversing 30 seconds, he would have been struck to death!In the void, a third lightning bolt appeared.This time, it was even more powerful!It seemed like he was going to kill Li Hao with one blow!Li Hao was somewhat angry. He looked up at the sky."I cultivate my Dao, what does it have to do with chaos?"He was furious!He swore in his heart that if one day he could survive and walk out of the Silver Moon ... He would open the sky once a day and stir up the chaos to calm his heart!Bastard!The primal Chaos lightning tribulation is trying to kill me!

Chapter 2449 Plans Can't Keep Up With Changes
The half-step sovereign hadn't fought yet, but the Thunder had arrived first!Be it Lin Hongyu, King Dali, or Zhang an, they could only hold on for a moment. These people were only here to stop the half-step sovereign for a moment, not to decide the outcome.But at this moment, before Li Hao could turn the tables, Thunderbolt came.The second attack reached the power of a half-step sovereign and shattered Li Hao. The third attack came quickly without any time for recovery.This was because the lightning had been brewing for a long time.Along the way, he only had one goal, which was to kill Li Hao."Damn it!""Damn it!" Li Hao cursed. He was no longer calm. As expected, plans never changed as fast as changes. Before this, how could he have expected that he would be targeted by the chaos lightning tribulation when he opened his own small world?What was this?He was already no match for a pseudo-Emperor, yet he still came to hit him when he was down. He was really ... Helpless.The third Thunderbolt arrived in an instant.Li Hao had almost no time to recover.Sure enough, some of the ancient books he had read were all lies. Li Hao's resentment was boundless. It was said that when one underwent a tribulation, one could draw it to outsiders and kill them.He could also train himself after a lightning tribulation and forge his own body. To break through in the lightning tribulation ... Bullshit!Can I break through in these few seconds? Moreover, this lightning was completely destructive. It had no intention of training him!This was purely to kill him!BOOM!The third Thunderbolt struck down. It was still incomparably powerful, and even crazy!BOOM!Li Hao's body, which had just recovered, was instantly shattered. Countless destructive forces exploded and crushed him into pieces. The next moment, a weak time power appeared, but ... The lightning was attacking and even destroying this time power.Once the power of time was broken, Li Hao would be completely dead.Obviously, the Thunderbolt seemed to know that this was Li Hao's essence. Countless destructive forces erupted, and a River between heaven and earth was broken, even cut off!Three Thunderbolts!In just three times, Li Hao's river of time was almost completely destroyed.With only a small part left, some of the destructive power was eliminated. This time, it took a full 20 seconds for Li Hao to walk out of the end of the world with great difficulty. He was extremely weak!The expressions of the powerhouses in the eight cities all changed.They could feel Li Hao's infinite weakness and that Li Hao was about to die!At this moment, even Zheng Yu and the others were a little surprised.Such a powerful Thunderbolt?Although it was not as powerful as the venerable sovereign's tribulation, how strong was Li Hao?The lightning tribulation he had attracted was so powerful that even a half-step sovereign could be injured. This was only the third strike. If it were really as the celestial pole had said, with nine tribulations as the foundation, Li Hao would be dead without their help!Not to mention nine times, Li Hao might not be able to survive the fourth time.It was only three times, and he had to guide the future self for two people.
