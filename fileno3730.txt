Ten thousand races contending for hegemony!Li Hao smiled.Yes, so many people had died today. There were the chaos race, the demon race, and all kinds of experts and great DAOs. When the time came, if the small chaos developed, it would be quite lively!As he thought about it, he smiled. It was a good thing.How could he succeed without tempering himself?Which expert didn't kill their way up?He could only hope ... That this lesser Dao of chaos was a bit purer. He could consider this opening of the sky his first attempt. He could only hope that this false chaos would have more of the true essence of the great Dao, and not just be all about killing."I hope ... Civilization can develop and the cultivation system can improve ..."Li Hao raised his eyebrows at this thought. The one he had seen before was mainly the Dao of divine text. He wondered if the future cultivators 'improvements on the Dao of divine text would meet his expectations.BOOM!The sound of an explosion rang out again.At that moment, the human King laughed maniacally. He was covered in blood as he killed the Yin Yang path master's clone on the spot. He roared madly and shouted, "It's good to die! It's just a clone, but the power of Yin and yang is so strong ... I'm going to kill your original body!"“……”The powerhouses glared at him from all directions!What a Savage person!You killed the Yin Yang path master's clone and now you want to kill me ... Do you really think you're invincible?In the depths of the chaos great Dao, the Yin Yang path master was still glaring at them even though he was unable to descend!This person could not be left alive!When Fang ping saw his clone, it was as if he was looking at a delicious dish. He was extremely crazy, far more excited, excited, and fanatical than when he was Zhan huntian. That kind of fanatical enthusiasm was not something that huntian could compare to at all.Even if there were benefits to killing huntian, it might not be worth it for the human King.However, killing the Yin Yang path master, even if it was just a clone, was a huge gain!Not far away.The spring and autumn Emperor had broken through the heavens and earth. The life and death path master's clone had also established the life and death Samsara. However, at this moment, the life and death path was no match for the life and death path.The life and death spirits were instantly destroyed and withered.The spring Autumn Supreme Emperor did not intend to snatch anything from her this time. However, she was quite happy to have the life-force delivered to her door."Fellow Daoist Spring Autumn," Li Hao suddenly shouted."You can just absorb the vitality. Too much deathly aura will be disadvantageous to you. Why don't you leave it here and let it dissipate naturally ..."Spring Autumn turned to look at Li Hao.Indeed, she only needed the power of life, but ... Why would she give you the power of death?The so-called natural overflow was actually being extracted by Li Hao's star ...However, when he saw Li Hao's smile ... Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn was a little afraid. After some consideration, he decided not to absorb the power of death. Instead, he waved it around and dispersed it!Forget it!Go!In any case, I only need life force.They had the upper hand.  However, at that moment, long Zhan's physical body began to collapse. A large amount of blood spurted out. The entire chaos great Dao trembled even more violently as many rank nine venerable sovereign avatars died in battle.Long Zhan panted heavily, his entire body covered in injuries.In front of him, there was still a rank nine venerable sovereign's clone. Its power was also overflowing, but much of it had dissipated.Long Zhan was like an ancient giant, standing proudly in the void and looking into the distance ... Over there, the screams of the chaos race had gradually died down. The experts of the chaos race had almost been completely wiped out!Long Zhan laughed mournfully.After this farewell ... Would they ever meet again?I don't know.He looked around and saw that a great battle had broken out. As more and more powerhouses joined the battlefield, the whole battlefield was covered in blood!He turned around and looked at Li Hao.At this moment, the star in front of Li Hao was getting larger and larger. However, it was stained with a large amount of blood, which gave him an ominous feeling.Long Zhan looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao also looked up.Long Zhan was on the verge of collapse. He killed four tier 9 avatars by himself.At this moment, there was one more person who was also in his target list.Even until now, Chaos Emperor had only killed three of them, who were genuine ninth level venerable sovereigns. Of course, there were more people who surrounded Chaos Emperor.However, without the help of time ... Chaos might not have been possible."Li Hao!"Long Zhan's voice resounded in Li Hao's heart.""Will you ... Interfere with the development of new world?"Li Hao looked at him and shook his head.He would not interfere.Even if ... There were changes in the future and the person who walked out was not that person, it did not matter. It did not matter who walked out, even if the person who walked out was long Zhan's spirit.So what?However ... It would be very difficult!There were some things that he didn't go into detail about. However, the majority of the powerhouses who died here were humans. This was one of them.Second, be it the 10000 DAOs or the divine text, they all belonged to him. Even the power of time was cultivated by humans. Perhaps the spirits of these powerhouses would have an advantage in the beginning ...But in the later stages ... I'm afraid ... Chaos will repeat itself.The human race would still have the upper hand.Of course, this was a story for later.If the chaos race was heaven-defying enough, they might have a chance. This was also the truth. But if ... You, long Zhan, can't win against the people of the future, you'd better accept your fate!Long Zhan laughed!He didn't ask any more questions or say anything else. He just looked at the expert in front of him. Several rank eight venerable sovereigns had already appeared behind him. They came from his ancient world and had arrived with the teleportation. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  His opponent wasn't just a Grade 9 clone, but three grade 8 experts.The four experts gathered!

Chapter 3731 Dao Tapir (1)(2)
The three grade 8 powerhouses were extremely excited and angry."Daoist master!"The rank nine path master cultivated the Dao of devouring. At that moment, he gritted his teeth."Long Zhan, you little bug, you're so audacious! After I kill you today, my world will eat Dragon liver and Phoenix gall as food! This Hundun, not even a Dragon can dream of living!"All the dragons must be killed!All of them!Even though he was a Dragon of the demon race, he, the devour Dao master, was not considered weak among the tier 9 cultivators. However, today, he was extremely miserable and was almost completely blown up. Fortunately, the experts of the realm came to his aid.However, he was even angrier after losing face in front of his subordinates!Long Zhan, how much battle power do you still have?After killing four ninth-rank clones and fighting Li Hao for a long time, do you ... Still have energy left?Long Zhan laughed!"Devoured?"A great Dao that was not weak!At this moment, he was indeed heavily injured and on the verge of death. The other party had sent reinforcements, and he clearly had no strength to kill them all. However, long Zhan laughed."What a joke. Aren't you here to protect Li Hao? I want to see ... If you ... Regret it!"As soon as he finished speaking, a Dragon's Roar reverberated in all directions!"I, long Zhan, have failed. My chaos race will not be destroyed because of my defeat!""We still have a chance!"He let out a roar to vent the anger in his heart and the unwillingness in his heart!At this moment, he didn't even know who he should hate.He laughed madly."I don't know who I should hate either. Perhaps ... I should hate the injustice of fate."BOOM!A deafening explosion reverberated through the entire West, reverberating through heaven and earth.An extremely majestic blood Qi instantly exploded!A giant dragon soared into the sky.The giant Golden Shadow appeared between the sky and the earth, covering the sky. This was the first expert who had truly fallen today.As for the others, only their clones had died.Other than a few weaker tier 8 powerhouses, he was the strongest person who had truly died in battle today ...Self-destruct!At this moment, the chaos great Dao seemed to be collapsing.The giant Golden Dragon followed the collapsed chaos great Dao and extended upwards, heading straight for the end of the great Dao. In an instant, it even shook away the great Dao spirits of some of the rank nine venerable sovereigns!In just an instant, the Soul of the Dragon Warrior shot up into the sky and reached the true core of the chaos.In the next moment, even Li Hao was surprised.The Dragon battle soul suddenly bit at something that looked like a heart ...The source of chaos!Long Zhan's Dragon Soul seemed to be smiling.The entire chaos seemed to be throbbing and crying out in pain.The group of ninth rank venerable sovereigns were stunned. The chaotic crowd was also shocked. The Dragon who carried the spirit of chaos had self-destructed. Not only that, but the Dragon Soul mixed with the spirit of chaos had broken through the defense and entered the origin of chaos. He bit off a piece of the source of chaos.It was swallowed into the dragon Soul, and at this moment, the Dragon Soul even showed signs of recovery ...It was as if the rich life force was trying to resurrect him.Long Zhan's laughter reverberated through heaven and earth!The next moment, a Dragon's Roar rang out, and the entire chaos great Dao trembled once more. The Dragon Soul extended downward, and the moment it fell, it exploded with a BOOM!The others didn't understand ...Li Hao understood!What a good long Zhan!He had actually used his own soul to devour a part of the origin of chaos. This guy, this time, it seemed that he really had the intention to rise in the New World. If he could devour the power of the origin of chaos and be born from spirit gathering ... This guy might really be able to rise!On the other hand, the devouring path master was in a terrible state.The instant explosion caused him to lose control. In an instant, two of the three tier 8s who had just arrived were blown apart. Their great DAOs scattered and they died!The other one was also heavily injured and kept coughing out blood.The clone of the devour Dao master also collapsed rapidly.Fortunately, the explosion didn't last long. At this moment ... It still gathered with great difficulty.He also coughed up blood ... But what he coughed up was not blood, but the power of a great Dao. He gritted his teeth and was extremely furious!This guy was still so brave even on the brink of death.It had directly killed two rank eight venerable sovereigns of the devouring realm!Damn it!Fortunately, he was dead.But now, the chaos great Dao was shaking even more violently than before. This time, it was likely that his true body would not be able to descend.A thought emerged in his mind ...Then, he thought about how his mission would be considered complete if this guy died.Just as he was thinking about it, suddenly ... He felt a pain in his chest!Dumbfounded, he turned his head to look ... At this moment, Li Hao was strolling leisurely and stabbing his sword into the core of the great Dao in his body, instantly shattering the devouring great Dao. Li Hao sighed.He did not even look at Dao master devouring. This was just a clone.Not worth paying attention to!He pulled out his sword and slashed down, turning the eighth grade venerable sovereign who was coughing up blood into dust. All his life force was devoured by the star in his hand.Li Hao looked at the exploding void and sighed.""Long Zhan ... Was born at the wrong time!"He could only sigh.Long Zhan was really talented and strong. In the eyes of the chaos race, he was also a hero. It was a pity that he was born at the wrong time. It was too difficult for him to rise up in this era when the chaos race had completely declined.Long Zhan's scheming ability was not considered too strong. Just having courage, how could he succeed?His brain was still not working enough!p It was still not enough to have a tyrannical body without a brain.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  The chaos race also lacked this spiritual light.Although long Zhan wanted to learn from the human race and absorb the wisdom of the human race ... It was a pity that he did not seem to succeed.

Chapter 3732 Dao Tapir (1)
Long Zhan self-destructed!At this moment, everyone looked over and saw that Li Hao had killed the clone of the path master of devouring realm and another expert of the devouring realm with a single sword strike.At this moment, even the master of Tian Fang was furious."Li Hao!"Long Zhan wanted to kill you, so I got people to protect you.In the end, long Zhan died, and you killed them all. Li Hao's viciousness is unparalleled.The speed at which he changed his attitude was unimaginable!"Even if we're all enemies, at this moment, we're all helping you split open the sky, and you actually killed them. You animal, you're not even as good as long Zhan!Even worse than a Chaos Beast!In the distance, the human King could not help but Mutter,""You turned hostile faster than I did ... I had to say a few words before I turned hostile ... You, kid, turned hostile without saying a word!"So fast!At the very least, he should have said something like,"all of you only want to kill me ..."In the end, he didn 't, and the other party killed him with a sword!His demonic nature was monstrous!At this moment, Li Hao was the only one on the battlefield who looked like a real demon.He didn't even blink when so many people died.Blood gushed toward Li Hao, and the stars in front of him glowed even more brilliantly, as if the Blood Moon had been reborn.A star made of blood! Under long Zhan's self-destruction, the power of the great Dao, the power of flesh and blood, including his spirit and the origin of chaos that he had devoured, were all absorbed by the star.The star was expanding crazily at a speed visible to the naked eye!A true top-tier physical body expert had built his Foundation.At this time, the chaos Emperor gasped for breath and laughed."Did you see that? Open your dog eyes and see who is the demon of chaos? Who was the source of the chaos? Is it me?""It's a waste that I cultivated the path of chaos. I should give it to Li Hao...Hahaha!"He laughed wildly!With this person around, even if he didn't cultivate the chaos Dao, the chaos would still be chaotic.This was the devil of chaos!Long Zhan was dead, and the experts of the chaos race were almost completely annihilated. Not only that, a large number of Dao master avatars had fallen, and a large number of kapok reinforcements had also fallen. In addition to Yuan Shuo and the tier 8 chaos heaven kapok experts who had died in battle earlier ...The number of grade 8s that had fallen here today had already exceeded the number on two hands, and it was still increasing madly.Over the past million years, almost all the level 8 powerhouses who had died in the chaos were related to Li Hao. 99% of the level 8 powerhouses who had died in the chaos were Li Hao's cause!Can't you guys see it?Who was more dangerous?Is it me?Chaos, I really can't accept it. I'm not as brutal as him!Brothers, open your dog eyes and take a look!Not far away, Li Hao smiled shyly. Just like in the past, he said softly,""You're overpraising me, I'm a good person! To protect the righteous ... Yes, to protect the human race!"It was silent!At this moment, the entire battlefield seemed to be disgusted by him. This beast was simply the ancestor of the crazed demonic Dao.A generation of time ... Were they blind to have chosen him to inherit time?However, he had to admit that ... Choosing Li Hao might be the best choice.With a weak force, he had pried open the entire chaos!At this moment, Li Hao looked into the distance. He saw a figure and smiled.You are still alive! "Hongyue, it's time to settle the score between us. I was just worried about some trouble. My demonic nature is a little too strong, and it's a little difficult to suppress my Dao of desire. Then you appeared ... Then I ... Will send you to heaven!"It was worth it for a weak rank-8 to live until now!This time, everything was bad, affecting him, negative, positive ...Everything had to be overturned and restarted!  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Since that was the case ... There had to be a spirit to absorb all of this. The Crimson Moon, the cultivator of desire, was really good!I didn't lose anything by keeping you alive until now.Li Hao's smile brightened. In an instant, he disappeared. Everyone looked over and saw that he had appeared in front of a weak cultivator ... They all heaved a sigh of relief.This beast, don't mess around!At this moment, everyone wanted to kill him, but they were afraid of actually killing him. It was extremely complicated!Since you're not going to cause any trouble, just dealing with a tier 8 ... Do whatever you want!That level 8 was very weak. Even if Li Hao was seriously injured, he could still take care of it.……Red Moon sovereign's face was pale.When he saw Li Hao appear in front of him, his face turned even paler. He was in despair. Whoever he chose to side with would die. Li Hao was pushing him into an abyss step by step!It was just like Ying Hongyue in the past.In the end, he died in despair."The name Red Moon ... Doesn't sound good!"Li Hao chuckled."Your name is the same as one of my enemies. I hate this name. Red Moon sovereign, everything is caused by your invasion of neo martial arts in the past. This is a cycle of karma. I want to ask ... Why ... Why do you insist on invading neo martial arts?"Red Moon sovereign's face turned pale.Looking at Li Hao in front of him, he was in complete despair and lost the motivation to resist. His body bent over, and he was on the verge of collapse."Why did you invade? How would I know ... It's sun god who came to me first. Why ... Don't you ask sun god? Instead, they asked me ... I was only retaliating. Why ... Did I become the sinner of The Collapse of Chaos?"What a joke!You guys invaded me first!Yes, it was sun god who first found trouble with him. After he defeated sun god, neo martial began to find trouble with him, and then the two sides had a huge conflict!Why can you all speak so innocently while I become the unparalleled sinner?Li Hao was stunned. After a long time, he nodded."I see ... It's really ... Complicated!"He smiled. Perhaps, it had something to do with the future.So, the sun god was related to that person!"Perhaps ... You'll still be able to see the person behind the scenes who made you so desperate ..."Li Hao laughed and lightly stabbed out with his sword!Red Moon sovereign no longer resisted and allowed the long sword to pierce through him. At this moment, there was only relief in his eyes.That's good!Long Zhan was killed, what am I?It's good that he's dead!He was free!BOOM!His body exploded, and all his spirituality was devoured by Li Hao's sword.By now, all the enemies in the four-sided domain had been killed by Li Hao.Long Zhan had fallen, and so had Feng Yan and the other experts of the chaos race.At this moment, Hong Yue had also fallen.The enemies in the four-sided domain were all gone.[PS: it should be almost done tomorrow.

3733 Chapter 604
The blood-red Star became brighter and brighter.With Hong Yue's death, Li Hao's enemies were almost all dead.As for the current level nine, chaos heaven, spring and autumn ...These people were not enemies.There was no enmity between them.It could only be considered a Dao competition.In Li Hao's opinion, it was normal for enemies in a Dao competition to die. There was no enmity between them, only the size of their fists.He turned to look at chaos.In the chaos, many of his rank nine clones were killed, as well as many rank eight experts. The more he fought, the fiercer he became. From the looks of it, he actually had the advantage. It was easy to see how powerful his true rank nine self, combined with the power of time ... Was.Li Hao, however, sighed inwardly.Flowing time!Sometimes, it was really too harmful.It was just like when he first came into contact with time. That feeling was intoxicating, and he was unable to extricate himself. He relied on time to defeat many enemies, but the price he paid was ... He was reincarnated four times! Without the cycle of life and death, Li Hao would have died in the passage of time.Chaos, you are not young anymore!A million years ago, these people were already tier 9.How was he young!Time was constantly flowing, and it was invincible, killing one Grade 9 clone after another. However ... Was your lifespan truly limitless?He had pretty much pushed time to grade-8.Every time, the consumption was too great.But in reality, chaos did not feel much. Only those who had used time would understand that wandering in the long river of time was as if they were immortal.In the early stages, Li Hao's lifespan was exhausted after using it a few times.He had reached the end of his life.Chaos, can you reverse life and death?If you can't ... How long can you continue fighting like this?How long can you live with your ninth-rank strength?Two million years?Three million years?Or longer?"Sealing off the world with time and causing those Grade 9 avatars to collapse one after another, it does look incomparably ferocious. But ... Didn't you notice that your hair has turned white?How many people could resist the temptation of time?In fact, Li Hao couldn't resist it either.In the beginning, he used time time, borrowed the power of the future, and swam over time and time again ...When did he start to wake up?It was after he had died several times in a row!It was when his lifespan was cut at the waist, his memories were erased, his emotions were diluted. It was when he had almost no desire and no desire that he understood that time had already tempted him into the abyss.Even someone as strong as the human King did not dare to receive time. This was because the human King knew that there was a high probability that he would not be able to resist the temptation of time.He was strong in one point, and he might as well not want it!I know I can't resist it, so I don't want it.At first, Li Hao didn't have the capital to do so. Later, he came to his senses, so he didn't want it. Today's chaos controlled time. This chaos might be the most glorious moment of his life! There were more than 20 ninth-rank avatars and dozens of eighth-rank venerable sovereigns. At this moment, other than long Zhan who had killed a few, he had already killed seven or eight of the remaining ones!  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Such a peak had even surpassed the time when he had stepped into the ninth step."Hahaha!"With a loud laugh, the chaos Emperor killed another rank nine venerable sovereign clone. He was panting and laughing. At this moment, he had truly reached his peak.He was invincible!With so many people besieging him, even though they were only avatars, the experts who had been so arrogant in front of him in the past all represented themselves.But now, they were all killed by him!With so many people surrounding him, he could even kill a real level nine, but now ... There were fewer and fewer of them, and they were all killed by him!Flowing time was too strong!He didn't know how to use too many of them. Two methods were enough.First, freeze time and space.The second was to cross the river.The former made the enemy unable to move, while the latter raised his speed to the extreme. Killing, killing experts, it was so simple.The chaos at this moment seemed to understand why Li Hao was undefeated!With such an ability, who could resist?Almost everyone at the same level would be killed by him in seconds!……Hu!The sound of breathing reverberated in the surroundings.The powerhouses were all covered in blood. At this moment, their faces were solemn.Even Tian Fang master was panting heavily.Even though it was only a clone, it still had a body of flesh and blood.The chaos, relying on the power of time, was killing them. When they had descended, there had been more than twenty rank nine clones, but now, only half remained.Many of the grade 8 reinforcements were also killed by the chaos.At this moment, if huntian wasn't strong enough to lead the ninefold guards to kill chaos, perhaps chaos would have broken out already!But ...The type 9 experts all seemed to have seen something, and their expressions all changed.Chaos ... His black hair was almost white!A faint aura of decay was emerging from chaos 'body.Everyone's expression changed slightly!Someone turned around and looked at Li Hao, and a thought suddenly occurred to him.This ...Chaos used the power of time, which was quite powerful, but ... Why did it feel like ... It was decaying?Some people looked at the master of tianfang.At this moment, the master of tianfang seemed to have expected this. He only glanced at Li Hao but did not say anything.Shi Guang was going to die!Time cultivators could travel between the past and the future and freeze time and space. Each time they did so, they would actually invite some trouble and consume a large amount of their lifespan. In the later years, Li Hao rarely used time in battle.Most of them were used as support.And in the early stages, Li Hao had gone through many cycles of life and death.

3734 Chapter 604
But chaos did not know the Dao of life and death.Even if he could, he hadn't condensed the heart of life and death. With such chaos, even if he could reverse life and death, would he have enough energy to go through the cycle of life and death?He was a level nine venerable sovereign!Tian Fang looked at Li Hao, his expression changing. This guy must know the weakness of time, but Li Hao never mentioned it. At this moment, chaos was surrounded and trying to break out.In addition, he had killed many enemies and was in the limelight for a while. Under such circumstances, even if he sensed the depletion of his lifespan, he might not be too concerned.If this continued ... Chaos wouldn't die of old age, right?Tian Fang looked at Li Hao! At this moment, after killing Red Moon, Li Hao suddenly said,"chaos, it's best to give up on time ... Time makes people old. Using the power of time is, after all, an external force and not self-cultivation. Every time it's used, it will consume a lot of lifespan!""You've been fighting for so long, and you've consumed a lot of energy. If you continue like this, you'll die of old age!""Give up?"Off in the distance, chaos Supreme Emperor was unparalleled in power. Chaos heaven Supreme Emperor, who had been suppressing him, was now being pushed back by him. Chaos felt as if he had truly reached the peak!His white hair fluttered in the wind, and he said coldly, Li Hao, I know you're good at scheming. Perhaps ... You've already planned this! But now that time has fallen into my hands, do you think I'll give up?"He could feel it. He could feel his lifespan being consumed.But at this point, giving up?He had already paid a huge price!He had offended all the tier 9 experts.Coupled with the feeling of invincibility and the feeling of being in control of his life, he ... Was unable to extricate himself!Didn't I cultivate to this day just for this moment?Invincible!  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Li Hao chuckled,"time is my greatest desire. I've said it before." Good advice can't persuade a damned ghost. Then hurry up and kill all the enemies as soon as possible. Otherwise, if you really drag it out until the end and your lifespan is exhausted, there will be no hope! At this moment, the only way is to kill all of them and break out of the encirclement. Then, you can comprehend life and death and condense the life and death reincarnation to gather enough reincarnation power. Even if you die of old age, you can still be Reborn!""Li Hao!"Tian Fang angrily rebuked.'Damn it!'This guy was doing it on purpose.Yes, it was obviously done on purpose.Chaos knew that it would consume its lifespan, so it had been holding back. It might have been thinking about how to solve this problem.At this moment, Li Hao told him that it was simple.Quickly kill everyone, seize the energy, break out of the encirclement, cultivate life and death, establish the life and death reincarnation, and live another life. Then, the trouble would be gone.How could chaos not be moved by these words? As expected!At this moment, chaos's eyes flickered. He looked at Li Hao and punched huntian, forcing him to retreat. He said coldly,""Why ... Are you telling me this?"Li Hao smiled."You're at the ninth-rank. Even if you're tempted by time, you can still sense the loss of your lifespan!" Secondly, if you don't kill them quickly, it's easy for accidents to happen if you drag it out. Third, as long as you're alive, they won't have the time to care about me. If you're really killed, then with so many eighth-ranked and ninth-ranked incarnations ... Wouldn't they all be staring at me?"This group of people was very complicated.No one was actually on the same side.One moment, he had to protect Li Hao, and the next moment, he had to kill Li Hao. Both of these changes would occur as time passed.At this moment, in a corner, the Lord of calamity gritted his teeth and said in a low voice,""Tian Fang, everyone, why don't we kill this bastard first?"He was a little angry!This bastard, did he really think that everything was under his control?He was only at the eighth step, yet he controlled everyone's fate here, toying with everyone. Did he really think that no one would dare to kill him?After killing Li Hao, was there really no way to start time again?Thinking of this, he said,"even if we don't kill him, we can't let him go. We have to suppress him first to prevent him from causing trouble!" We can't let people do as they please!"Suppress Li Hao!They were still wary of killing him, but they could still suppress Li Hao.He would even support chaos.Perhaps, it would even give everyone a chance to catch their breath.Li Hao looked at him and smiled."Calamity? I didn't raid your ancestral grave. Why make me your enemy?" It was just a battle from my memories a million years ago. You are too petty and hold grudges! Look around me, are there any enemies nearby? Did someone say I wasn't good? You're unique?"“……”The Lord of calamity was furious!Were there any more enemies?All of them!However, those who truly have a grudge against you have all been killed by your grandson. Of course you have no enemies!At this moment, the chaos Emperor didn't say anything, but his aura became stronger again. He was about to kill this group of people when Li Hao said,""Right, senior chaos, do you know how to turn back time? The you from a million years ago was a true rank nine ... If you reverse time, you can return to your peak state, a true rank nine venerable sovereign!"“……”There was a moment of silence."You think I'm an idiot?" even the chaos Emperor couldn't help but curse. Do you really think I don't know the consequences of reversing a million years? I'll die of old age directly ..."Li Hao chuckled, dying of old age is better than being killed! I'll first recover to my peak state, kill everyone, and take their life force and the power of their great DAOs. There's still a chance of maintaining them for a while ... Of course, it's best to use them as a trump card. At a critical moment, I'll break through the chaos great Dao and use time to enter the depths of the chaos, kill a few tier nine true bodies, and take the origin of chaos ... I'll be able to recover immediately!"

“……”Chaos's expression changed drastically!艹!The language of the demons.He didn't want to hear it, but at this moment, he couldn't help but listen and think.'If I really do recover to my peak battle-power from a million years ago and can still control time, I can instantly charge back into the depths of the chaos. Can I ... Kill a few ninth-rank true bodies, seize the origin of chaos, and refine it directly?''Then ... Will I be invincible?I'm not afraid of time consuming my lifespan!He knew!He knew that this was Li Hao's scheme, that Li Hao was trying to tempt him, but he ... Went a little crazy. He roared angrily,""Do you think I'm an idiot? How was that possible? With more than 20 ninth-rank true bodies keeping watch, how could they not be on guard if you said it? I can't possibly succeed!"At this moment, the master of tianfang said in a low voice,""He's bewitching you! Chaos, if you really take it seriously, you will die without a doubt! Chaos! Time has already made you unable to extricate yourself! Give up on time! If you go on like this ... You'll die without a doubt!"It was true.He could feel that chaos was actually wavering. If it was someone else, they would also be wavering.Every word was true!Li Hao's suggestion was true, and so was the result, provided that everything could be realized perfectly. He had to break through the chaos great Dao, kill a level nine, enter the depths of the origin of chaos, and refine it ...Then chaos would be invincible!But ... Was that possible?Even chaos knew that the possibility of that was very small.However, the possibility was very small, which meant that there was still a slight possibility. To them, there was a slight possibility of becoming the strongest Overlord of the chaos, the only Overlord ... It was still worth a try."Even if you can't do it now, at the last moment, when you're about to lose and die, if it were you, wouldn't you take a gamble?Everyone had to take a gamble!"You think I'm an idiot?" the chaos Emperor was a little angry. Would they believe him? As for giving up on time ... Tian Fang, you're delusional! You want it, you all want it, why can't I control it? You guys don't have a chance, but I do. If time is controlled by you, will you give up?"All the tier 9 experts were criticizing time because they were unable to control it.If he handed it over to them, he could guarantee that no one would say this again.Chaos and anger!Because I'm weaker than you?So, I'm not worthy?F * ck! ,m He couldn't help but think of Li Hao's words. Of course, he couldn't take Li Hao's words completely seriously. What he said was only ideal.He would break through the chaos great Dao, enter the origin of chaos, seize the origin of chaos, and become the number one in the world ... p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Yes, it was wonderful ... But it was too difficult.But ... If he really turned back time and returned to a million years ago, if ... If he killed a level nine, such as ... The path master of life and death, could he seize the power of life and death and directly reincarnate?Then ... Was there a chance of rebirth?Li Hao's words echoed in his mind like the language of the devil. At this moment, he could feel his lifespan running out. Although his enemies were getting fewer and fewer, if he wanted to defeat them completely ... He might really run out of lifespan!What to do?While he was still thinking about this, Li Hao spoke again,""Oh, right. I forgot to mention this. Other than reversing the flow, you can also extend it. You can even summon the future ... Just like last time, I summoned future experts to fight for you ... But the future is uncertain! "Perhaps, your future will be dark and gloomy, and you will die. As for the one you summoned, perhaps ... You will have nothing. The past is more reliable!""Besides, there's one more thing ... Your chaos great Dao is still integrated into the chaos great Dao. It's still under the restrictions and control of the chaos great Dao. Although it's not as troublesome as long Zhan's ... Once you win, these people might be in the depths and strip you of your chaos great Dao. So, if I were you, I would have to think of a way to separate the chaos great Dao from the chaos great Dao ... Time is useful. Turning back and going back to the past can strip your chaos great Dao from the chaos ...""Perhaps, right now, those tier 9 true bodies are already doing it!""Li Hao!""Li Hao!"“……”At this moment, everyone roared in anger. There were Tian Fang and the others, but there were also people who were confused.Damn it!Bastard!I can't take it anymore. That's right, my chaos great Dao is still rooted in the depths of my chaos great Dao. Now that I've fallen out with them, What should I do if these people join forces to strip away my chaos great Dao?Although time was powerful, his control over time was not deep enough ...All of a sudden, chaos was a little anxious!In the depths of the chaos, on the periphery, countless great DAOs stood. Almost all of them had turned into physical entities and were the source of their great DAOs. If these level nine cultivators were really crazy and insisted on breaking his great DAOs and paying the price, perhaps ... He would really be in trouble!Thinking of this, chaos became anxious!Tian Fang and the others were flustered and exasperated at this moment!That's right, this was also a precautionary measure. Chaos might not have thought about this at this moment. After all, he didn't have time to think about it when the war broke out. But now that Li Hao mentioned it ...They were very worried that the chaos would really be reversed and they would return to a million years ago and recover their peak combat strength!At that time, he would be in big trouble!Li Hao yawned and continued,"also, the path of calamity is constantly entangled with time. If you don't kill the Lord of calamity, it'll be difficult for you to escape his lock. Even if you kill them all and escape, he'll still be able to lock onto your position ... This guy, calamities are everywhere!"

In an instant!Lightning gathered. At this moment, the Lord of calamity could no longer bear it and simply ignored the chaos.He was going to tear that bastard Li Hao to pieces!If this dog didn't die, he would simply be a devil. Every word he said was true, but they all carried boundless malice and bewitching power!How could a young man be so vicious?A tribulation more difficult than a tribulation!It was simply a disaster!"A tribulation ..."The master of Tian Fang bellowed and frowned. They were indeed angry, but to kill Li Hao now ...The Lord of calamity growled,"I won't kill him. I'll suppress him!" You guys deal with the chaos, I'll suppress this beast, infect it with a plague, and punish it with lightning tribulation. I'll make it so that it can't live or die!""Human King, spring and autumn ... It's time to live!"Li Hao shouted and laughed."You two should stop getting involved in the battle between the ninth-rank combatants. Let them fight. Why don't you come to my place and help me?" At this time, let them fight each other. We ... Just watch the show!"In the distance, the human King was currently absorbing the power of Yin and yang. When he heard this, he laughed. "You're afraid that chaos will erupt and everyone will be killed in one go so that they can seek refuge at your place? I'm afraid that he'll explode and kill you first!"He wasn't afraid to say it directly.Even though he was laughing and talking, the human King still stepped into the air and shouted to the people in the battle ring,""Chaos, when you explode later, kill huntian first. This guy's order has collapsed and he's about to turn into chaos. He might fight with you for control of chaos. Kill him ... Then kill Li Hao. Don't attack us. We're very supportive of you. Look, I even helped you kill the Yin Yang path master's clone!"On the other hand, Spring Autumn did not know what to say. He could only say,""I helped you kill ... Kill the path master of life and death's clone!"Anyway, just kill as many people as you want, but don't kill us."Huntian!" The chaos Emperor was furious. He sent huntian flying with a punch and roared,""Bastard! Do I need to reverse time and space?"No need!These bastards, they're so sure that I'm going to turn back time, I'm so angry!I know it's Li Hao's scheme. How can I be fooled?What if I die of old age after the reversal?Are you going to take responsibility?At this moment, Tian Fang also said in a deep voice,"chaos! Don't listen to their words anymore. These few people are all good at bewitching others! They're only trying to bewitch you. You'll die for sure if you reverse a million years!"Damn it, he was also angry!The more they kept talking and reminding him, the angrier chaos became. It proved that chaos actually took it to heart. A Grand Tier 9, if he didn't take it to heart, was there a need to refute at this time?He was obviously tempted!At this moment, the human King slashed at the Lord of calamity's avatar and laughed,""Jinx, get lost. I'm not interested in killing you!"  p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Lord of calamity's face turned ashen!Jinx?The human King laughed,"What are you looking at me for?" If the Lord of calamity wasn't a jinx, could it be something else? You are, don't deny it! If your true body is here, I'm still afraid of you. You're just a clone, long Zhan killed several of them just now, and I just killed Yin Yang. Do you think I can kill you?"He laughed again."Spring autumn is here, too. With Li Hao, there's probably no hope if you don't send three or five of you. But can you still send three or five ninth-rank clones?" When my neo martial artist powerhouses come ... I won't be afraid even if three or five more come! Get lost and go fight the chaos, or else ... I'll really kill you!"Standing in the air, Li Hao looked at the Lord of calamity and said with a smile,""Don't look at me, I'm not scolding you! A jinx ... No, path master calamity, if you have the time to find trouble with me, why don't you go deal with the chaos Emperor instead? why are you staring at me?" The Lord of calamity's face turned ashen!However, he also knew that it was impossible for him to fight against these people alone.All of them had the ability to kill a type 9 avatar individually, unless their true bodies descended.But now, it was obviously unrealistic to transfer so many 9th rank clones, and ... The others might not agree.He was furious!Holding back the urge to kill Li Hao with a single punch, he turned around and headed straight for the battle. Li Hao smiled and said,""Chaos Emperor ... Then I'll begin splitting open the sky. Tian Fang, seniors, please help me maintain this for a while ... When I'm halfway through splitting open the sky, I hope you can kill chaos and reverse time so that you won't delay my work!""Chaos, don't die too quickly. If you die too quickly, I'm worry...That time will return early and interfere with my plan to split open the skies! You should fight huntian first, don't be in a hurry to unleash your power. I think you can still hold on for a while ..."“……”The powerhouses glared at each other!Bastard!How detestable!How hateful!This person ... Deserved to die!At this moment, what Tian Fang and the others were thinking was that if Li Hao could split open the sky and succeed, time would return. Li Hao ... Might really give up time. If he dared to give it to chaos, he would dare to give it to others.Other than chaos, there might even be a fourth generation time cultivator ... Anyway, he would be stronger than these two!As for the chaos Emperor, he was also gnashing his teeth in anger!F * ck, you split open the sky?Without time, one could still split open the heavens. But without time, what was the point of splitting open the heavens? time was the same, and in a world without time, the pseudo-chaos was not powerful ... Do you really think that I'm dead?That's good!If these three bastards went to split open the sky, they wouldn't have time to participate in the battle!It was pretty good!For both sides, it was indeed a good thing that these people had gone to split open the sky. Otherwise ... With a group of experts watching from the side, both sides would actually feel pressure and fear.

And Li Hao said this openly to make them feel at ease.We won't cause any trouble!You guys go ahead and fight!Let's split open the sky!The human King glanced at Li Hao, who smiled and said,""Let's go, it's not just you guys ... New martial, Silver Moon ... Oh, spring and autumn, all of you can participate! Splitting open the sky is very interesting. The preparation work is almost done, only time is left. There's no hurry!"He glanced at chaos and the others and laughed,""I'm guessing that there's a high probability that he'll be killed by someone or die of old age ... Time will return! If it doesn't work out ... In any case, the probability of him being done for is the highest!" After saying that, he turned around and walked out.The human King chuckled and quickly followed. He didn't say that he would continue to participate in the battle. Over here, there was a large group of clones, but only a few had their true bodies. So what if they killed all of them?If it was the main body, he would be a little interested and want to take advantage of it.However, they were all clones. Killing one of them would not be of much use. Since Yin Yang had been killed by him, the others did not matter.The spring Autumn Emperor was also at a loss.Such a Great War had broken out in the West. Li Hao was clearly the instigator, but at this moment, he was acting like an outsider. She couldn't understand it and was still confused. How did this group of people end up like this?……Soon, Li Hao's group of three left the battlefield.The Queen quickly followed.Behind them, people continued to gather.The neo martial artists, the Silvermoon people, and the powerhouses under spring and autumn.The ninefold guards had gone to fight the chaos. All the experts of the chaos race had been killed. At this moment, they didn't have any major enemies. The enemies were all in their own battles.All of a sudden, they, who were originally the core of the battle, had become passers-by.At this moment, Li Hao looked at the chess board and said, let's go to the square domain!"What?"Dao Qi was startled. Where to?"Go to the four-sided domain!"Li Hao laughed."That's a good place. It's my Silver Moon, the new martial, the tianfang world, the world of calamity, and many other worlds. It's also where the spirit of chaos appeared ... Go there and create a new world! The West has been blown up, so why are we still here ... Let's go, these people know our whereabouts and won't chase us immediately!"Go to the square domain?Dao Qi was stunned! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Over here, after fighting for so long, you crippled the West, and now ... You're going to open the sky in the East?Are you still human?If you'd known this earlier, you would've gone straight to the four-sided domain and huntian wouldn't have started a war with you.So ... You're just deliberately stirring up sh * t? At this moment, the others were also extremely complicated. Even the Supreme neo martial could not help but Twitch their mouths. This kid was really black-hearted.So, from the beginning to the end, he had no intention of splitting open the sky in the West!This guy's target had always been the four-sided domain!Right now, the four-sided domain was the safest. There was no other reason. The powerhouses had all been killed!Li Hao said as he walked,'break the order in the West and turn the entire chaos into the master of chaos! In this way, the creation of a new heaven will become the gathering place of natural order. Do you understand what I mean?"Some people did not understand."You mean ... Order will still exist. Since the West is in chaos, the entire chaos is in chaos. Now that order can't be established, the natural reaction of chaos will allow order to be established in the new heaven when you open a new heaven?" the Supreme martial artist replied.Li Hao nodded and said,'Supreme martial artist understands me! That was what it meant. In this way, order would return and restrain chaos. Chaos would be killed sooner or later ... Of course, this was another matter! In the New World, order naturally exists. I don't need to spend too much energy. If I don't break the order in the West, I won't be able to establish a perfect order in the New World!"“……”His heart was too black!The group of people criticized in their hearts again."Lord Marquis, then ... What about Yuan Shi and the others?" Qian Wuliang couldn't help but ask."I'm fine. I've already extracted his spirit and fused it with the new heaven ... Don't worry!"Li Hao laughed,"you can really kill your master?" I'm not that kind of person!"He talked and laughed, as if the group of people who were still fighting in the distance had nothing to do with him.At this moment, even Spring Autumn could not help but ask,""Was this your plan from the start? So, it's good for you to stay in the West. Using my hands, you brought everyone to go against huntian, forced your teacher to die, and killed long Zhan ... Were all in your plan?"Li Hao shook his head.Chun Qiu heaved a sigh of relief!Li Hao explained,"I didn't plan to do that at first. In fact, I planned to leave everyone to me. How could I split open the sky on my own? at that time, I was thinking that if chaos didn't appear, I would give you time. With the spring and autumn withering technique, I could resurrect your countless clones. Then, you would be so powerful that you might be able to attack the origin of chaos and strengthen your race ... You might even be able to fight better than chaos! More importantly, your Dao of life and death is more compatible with time. For all your clones to become your main body ... Tsk tsk ..."Li Hao clicked his tongue."Actually, I'm a little worried myself. If you can really use it, your body will return to its peak strength ... How strong will you be?" You can take on a hundred of them...At that time, you can attack the prime essences of chaos, and I might have a better chance!"艹!Supreme Emperor Spring autumn's expression was complicated.艹!This ... Was this true?Or did he say that on purpose?"But on second thought, if ... If I control time, and my clones are all restored to their peak state under the effects of time, will I ... Be stronger than chaos?Maybe ... He would!She had too many clones, and she would shed them once a year!

However, with each transformation, the power would shift, so the clone wasn't too strong. But if he used the power of time to recover to his peak, then just how many rank eight clones would he have?"It can restore the doppelganger's peak combat power?" she gulped."It needs energy. Next, it needs to consume your lifespan to replenish it ... You don't have much lifespan left, but you can burst out with instant brilliance and all your clones will instantly return to their peak. You might be able to blow everyone up at once ... Of course, if you're dead, I won't care."What a black-hearted person!The spring Autumn Emperor's heart trembled as he gritted his teeth."I won't take your Shi Guang!"If I don't want it, how are you going to scheme against me?Li Hao looked at her with a special expression and smiled.You don't want it?Are you serious?I don't believe it!"Of course, if you really don't want it, then I can't do anything about it. But ... Is that possible?At this moment, the others also took a deep breath. They were really terrified!If what Li Hao said was true, and his initial plan was to ... Transfer time to spring and autumn, and use spring and autumn to revive all her clones, what kind of concept was that?Would an even more terrifying battle break out today?It was no wonder why this fellow was so calm, as if he wasn't worried about the chaos. It turned out that his secondary goal was the chaos, and his primary goal was the Spring and Autumn period!Li Hao continued,"don't think too much, everyone. Actually, giving the power of time to anyone is better than giving it to me! For example, if he gave it to long Zhan, if long Zhan used time to strengthen himself and shake the chaos great Dao, he would also be surrounded and killed by Grade 9 experts! If we give it to huntian, the order of huntian will become one, and it will also attract the siege of tier 9 experts ... So, with those tier 9 experts around, they will fight no matter who we give it to!"Chaos was just one of the options.In any case, as long as he was prepared to give it out, the result was already decided.It didn't matter who it was, but it couldn't be given to experts.If an expert got it, they would be more threatening than Li Hao. The main reason was that Li Hao restrained himself from using it, while others didn 't.The human King was not satisfied,"you mean you won't give it to me?" I'm not as strong as them?"Li Hao sighed."I'll give it to you ... But you'll cut it in half. What's the point of playing?"What was he saying!Didn't you say you didn't want this?The human King didn't want it, so I gave it to him, but he cut it in half ... Alright, everyone, stop playing! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The human King chuckled,"of course not. I'm not that kind of person. Actually ... If I were you, it wouldn't be good to give it away for free. Why don't you hold an auction and sell it? you can even get back a sum of money!"“……”Everyone was completely speechless!That's enough, you two!Li Hao also smiled and said,""Let's not talk about this anymore. Activate the teleportation and go to the four-sided domain! "If chaos wins, it will probably take some time. If Tian Fang wins, he can descend at any time, so he's not afraid of me running away!"Dao Qi didn't say much. Although it would consume a lot of energy to teleport a group of experts, he didn't have time to care about that at this moment!At this moment, Li Hao turned to look at Chun Qiu and said,""Later, you can give me some resources ..."Spring autumn's expression turned ugly!Li Hao explained,"the stronger the New World is, the better it is. When the sky is opened later, everyone will be in the harmonious spirit realm. It's good for everyone to comprehend the New World!" To experience the true creation of heaven and earth! I've already paid a huge price ... Of course, if you don't want to, you can choose not to participate!""Where's the human King?"Spring Autumn was a little unhappy. Li Hao explained,""He's poor, but you're not! Besides, the new silver Moon won't be separated from you, so you're an outsider after all ... Right?"艹!Chunqiu really wanted to curse!She didn't want to participate at all ... Alright, she still had some thoughts. She nodded and gritted her teeth."Okay!""Thank you for your generosity, fellow Daoist Spring Autumn!" Li Hao smiled."You'll participate in it personally and observe the evolution of life and Dao. It'll be an improvement for everyone. It'll be very interesting!" "It will be more interesting when time returns," he said expectantly."I hope chaos can be killed at the best time. It's not good to die early, but it's also not good to die late!"“……”The group of people were mentally exhausted. This fellow was truly vicious!……"Li Hao Ran away!"At this moment, the chaos Emperor also roared,""Do you still want to pester me? "He ran away. My control over time is not as strong as his. If he really kills me, he will succeed in splitting open the skies and strengthen time. He will definitely be more difficult to deal with than me! He went to the four-sided domain, where the roots of chaos lie. If he opens the sky there ... Everyone will be affected!"Why do you have to go against me?Tian Fang was also a little angry,'just give up! Chaos! Without time, you won't die! If Li Hao can give up, why can't you?"“……”"Chaos is silent. You got it, and you're unwilling to give it up. In any case ... I won't give up!"The next moment, the chaos Emperor was furious. He didn't care anymore and time froze again.BOOM!With a loud bang, an expert's clone was instantly killed by him. As for himself, his combat strength was still at its peak, but ... His hair was getting paler.He knew that he had consumed too much of his lifespan!If this went on, he would really be exhausted to death. These people were only clones, and he only had huntian and the others. If he killed their clones, they wouldn't feel any heartache at all, but he ... Would really die.You're all forcing me!He was extremely angry. 'You won't die, so you're forcing me without any restraint!'He turned to huntian with cold eyes.The others are clones, but what about you?You're also forcing me?I will kill you first!In the current chaos, he was extremely angry and unwilling. Li Hao, the person in question, had run away. He felt ... That he had to take the blame, and he was unwilling to give up on time.All of a sudden, he was at a loss!"It's all your fault!"As soon as he finished speaking, he charged toward hun Tian and roared madly!I'll beat you to death, you grandson!The master of order isn't a good person, and you're even more so.Huntian was also forced to retreat and kept spitting blood. He was no less depressed than his opponent. His West ... Had been completely destroyed!Li Hao, that bastard, had run away.He was not prepared to split open the sky in the West!Bastard!"If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have done this. Now, not only have I lost a large number of my subordinates, the West has collapsed, order has collapsed, my combat power has been damaged, and I'm being suppressed by this bastard chaos!Li Hao really caused a lot of trouble!At this moment, the chaos great Dao shook again. Li Hao's words were true.Those ninth-rank true bodies ... Were shaking the foundation of chaos, the Dao of chaos!He wanted to forcefully suppress, strip, and interrupt the Dao of chaos!The chaos Emperor's eyes glowed with ferocity. Don't push me. If you push me too hard, I'll fulfill Li Hao's wish and reverse time to return to my peak to fight you!

3739 Chapter 605
Four regions.Li Hao was like an outsider to the battle in the West, no longer taking part in it.He had returned to the square domain.This was the starting point of new martial and silver Moon. It could also be considered their home, even though in the chaos, there was almost no concept of home other than the world.However, his feelings for the four-sided domain were still somewhat different.Of course, the current square region was very desolate.The great world was almost completely annihilated!The four-sided domain had seemed very big when they first came out, but now, it seemed very small. Apart from the people of spring and autumn, Li Hao and the people of the human King were almost all from the four-sided domain.Whether it was light, Wushan, Thunderlord, or emptiness ...Including Dao Qi, they were all from the four regions.The small four-direction region had produced many experts, including the strongest among the current level nine experts, Tian Fang. The not-so-weak tribulations all came from the four-direction region.There were some secrets buried in this place.Including the first generation of time, the true time cultivators, Zhan, also came from this place. The four-sided domain was very quiet.Unlike the War in the West, which caused the world to collapse, the world here was almost destroyed in the last war. Now, long Zhan and the others had led the strong to battle, but they had also died ... There was not even a single advanced venerable sovereign here.The weak venerable sovereigns could not even sense the changes in the world.Some venerable sovereigns didn't even know that there would be a great battle today. Although the commotion was frightening, they might have sensed some faint movements, but they didn't pay much attention to it."Four-sided domain ..."Li Hao murmured. The red blood ball in his hand was particularly eye-catching.He held the blood ball and flew straight in the direction of tianfang world.Tian Fang had taken root there. Perhaps that place was more suitable for opening up a new Sky.The group of experts quickly followed him, all somewhat curious and doubtful ... At present, Li Hao didn't have the power of time. If he split open the sky, the time should be the same, right?Or could it be that the natural flow of time was different?For small worlds, before one left the world, they were usually sealed. The flow of time was different. At this moment, they were a little suspicious. Would a heaven and earth created by man be different?Would they be able to maintain the different flow of time?Or ... The time was the same?If they were the same, and Time and Stars were on the other side of chaos, then the New World wouldn't grow quickly. Even if someone really became incomparably powerful in the future, they wouldn't be able to walk out immediately. It was very difficult.As for time reversal, the other party also came along with time ... Li Hao didn't add the power of time into it, which meant that this world might not even have time in it. Time reversal, my ass!Even the future emperor of the human race would not be able to come through time. ……Where the original tianfang world was.Li Hao looked around for a while. There were only ruins left here. Last time, the human King had absorbed the power of heaven, and the vast world had almost become a deserted island. Although the world still existed, it was like a chaotic sand without any energy.Li Hao didn't say anything. He just threw the red blood ball.The ball of blood began to expand crazily.It spread!In the blink of an eye, it had almost grown to the size of a world.Everyone was a little puzzled and looked on curiously.Li Hao looked at the bloody world. This time, many things had been fused into it. He took a deep breath and activated his own power. The power of great DAOs and the power of Chaos continued to fuse into the world."Everyone, stop looking ... Everyone, fuse the power of your great DAOs into it, including your own comprehension of the great DAOs and the heavens and earth ... Let this world return to its primal state of chaos, but it also contains the truth of the great DAOs!"Everyone looked at each other. All of them?Without much thought, someone quickly took action.Suddenly, the bloody world seemed to grow hair, and long tentacles wrapped around those people. Some of them were shocked. Li Hao said in a deep voice,""It's fine, this is Dao! "The Dao of the New World and the Dao law are the channels connecting the New World. Everyone, you don't have to worry about them ..."Venerable Emperor spring and autumn slightly resisted.We're not even close!I'm not at ease!Li Hao seemed to know what she was thinking. He said,""Spring and autumn, perhaps the New World has the key to solving the problem of your clan's lifespan. If you don't integrate into it ... Are you sure you won't regret it?" Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "It's just opening a world," Spring Autumn retorted."What's so special about a bigger world?""As you wish!"Li Hao ignored her.Chun Qiu hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth. He allowed the Dao to wrap around him like a long whip. At this moment, this blood-red world was like a heart, and the Dao was like blood vessels that wrapped around everyone.Everyone began to merge their great DAOs into it, and their hearts seemed to come alive.There was a faint pulse!This new world had gathered everything from many ninth-rank clones, as well as a large amount of eighth-rank venerable Emperor's great Dao power and comprehension. It could be said that in the entire chaos, Li Hao had collected everything he could, except for his ninth-rank true body.There was even a wisp of chaos origin in it, which was bitten off by long Zhan.The others were all fusing their powers.Li Hao, on the other hand, just watched in silence.After waiting for a while, he saw that the heart was beating even more violently. He took a deep breath and suddenly, a mouthful of blood spurted out from his mouth. Even the force of moaning spread out and began to cover the entire blood-red ball.
