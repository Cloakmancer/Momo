He had already finished speaking!The three defeated soldiers were stunned and didn't know what to say. Li Hao smiled helplessly.""I knew it. The Li daoheng that I had so easily schemed against previously was probably not the real li daoheng! The only thing he didn't anticipate was ..."Flowing time!It was probably so."The blood Emperor is the reincarnation of Zhan Tiandi," Li Hao said."Let's not deny it. The blood Emperor came to Silver Moon before. Did he come to see the sword?""I ... I've seen him.""Did the blood Emperor mention anything about resurrecting something?""I ... I don't know." p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The sword tree didn't know what to do. It had the initiative, but now it could only answer passively, because Li Hao had finished many of the things it wanted to say!"You guys were in Silver Moon a long time ago. Were you guys there when the world was split into eight?" Li Hao asked after some thought."Well ... Yes, we were here with venerable sword not long ago ..."Li Hao nodded again."Then, did the Li Dynasty appear after the Silver Moon split the sky into eight parts? or perhaps it wasn't the Li Dynasty. In any case, a beginner level martial artist occupied the North.""Yes, I am!"Li Hao nodded again.At this moment, there were no more secrets about Silver Moon in his eyes.As expected, that person was here to resurrect the existence of the blade.The blood Emperor was just a temporary arrangement. It was not to Target Red Moon or anyone else, but to resurrect the cat in the blade.He was gathering the power of faith from the heavens and earth, nurturing it with the blood saber. He was using the auras of the eight divine weapons to protect his blood saber!If the sword Saint did not swallow the heaven and earth, then he would have to cultivate it slowly.If the sword Saint devoured the world ... The moment he devoured the world, the world might explode with a powerful counterattack. It might take the opportunity to give birth to a lot of opportunities and revive the cat.But ... What kind of existence could not even be resurrected by venerable sovereigns?The blood Emperor had a close relationship with the human King, but the human King couldn't be revived?Did he have to go to the small world?It was slightly strange! However, it was clear that the blade was not meant for the red moon Emperor, nor was it meant for li daoheng ... He did not care about these people at all. The blood Emperor was only here for the cat of the blade!As for the God of beginner martial ... At this moment, Li Hao vaguely understood that the reason why he was so bold and dared to use the names of celestial ruler and sun god was that he had someone backing him up. Venerable sword knew about this, so did venerable blood Emperor. It was even possible that the other party was someone invited by venerable blood Emperor!His mission was probably just to protect the knife and the cat in the knife so that it could be revived safely!As for the others ... Li Hao furrowed his brows slightly. This person did not even care about Silver moon's near-annihilation ... Perhaps he was truly a beginner martial artist and not a new one. He only had eyes for the cat in the saber."Eight divine weapons ... Eight great families" bloodlines ... I think he's just borrowing the power of the eight great families to provide some energy for his saber! It won't take too long to cause the saber to lose its energy!""No wonder ... The bloodline of the eight great families is so close to that saber!"Li Hao sighed."Perhaps li daoheng has the ambition of a Wolf ..." He continued."He even wants to take this saber and swallow it. He even wants to swallow the existence within it!"At this thought, Li Hao still had some doubts.""Has the human Queen been here before? Why did she leave her sword behind?"Celestial ruler-dominating's gloves ... It might not be iron head sovereign, but the beginner martial stage expert.But the human Queen's sword ... There was a high probability that the other party had really been here, so what was the reason?Li Hao still didn't understand this.He didn't understand, but Jian Shu did. Seeing that Li Hao finally had something he didn't understand, he hurriedly said,""The human King is also an expert in sword principle, and the best swordsman in the world is sword venerable! In the past, the human Queen descended to the Silver Moon and sparred with revered sword. Revered sword could be considered the Queen's teacher ... After that sparring, revered sword once said that the way of the sword is the way of the sword, but the way of the sword is also not the way of the sword. The sword is only the form, and the original is the way!""Then ... The Queen abandoned her sword ..." He said.Li Hao was stunned. He nodded and mumbled,""Yes, the Dao of the sword is the Dao of the sword, but it is also not! 10,000 DAOs returning to one, how could there be a single sword Dao? the sword was the shape, the reality was the Dao! As expected! The new Dao is related to the revered sword, and all the DAOs are combined into one to form a sword. It's just that he's used to swords ... It's a pity, it's really a pity!"What's a pity?The sword tree and the others were dumbfounded, but Li Hao muttered,""You don't understand ... If ... If Sword Saint had more time, he could have become a real master of the world and the master of the great Dao! In the true sense, they could stand shoulder to shoulder, and even surpass the human King and the others! It's a pity ... Venerable the sword might know, but he couldn't bear to split up new martial ..."At this moment, he had a vague understanding.The sword Saint might have found a way to create a new Dao universe, but this method ... Was likely to split the new martial arts!The sword Saint had no choice!The sword tree and the others looked at each other again. To be honest, they believed that the sword Saint was extremely powerful and could even match a Supreme martial artist ... But they didn't dare to think that he could match or even surpass the enemy King!Li Hao ... Wasn't trying to flatter him, was he?"As I said, the Heaven's Will is a sword, the Dao Meridian is a sword, and the Galaxy is a sword ... Because this might be born from the will of the sword venerable! The sword is in shape, how can it not be a sword?"He had long guessed this, and today, he was even more certain of his own guess!

Chapter 2321 The Silver Moon's Secret (3)
As for the three in front of him, they were already dumbfounded.They had originally wanted to dispel Li Hao's doubts, but now, they didn't say anything, and Li Hao didn't ask anything. Now ... It seemed that Li Hao had dispelled their doubts. More importantly, they actually didn't understand many things!"The entire Silver Moon is divided into two parts ... One is for revered sword to comprehend the Dao, and the other is for the blood Emperor to resurrect a cat! They didn't interfere with each other ... The appearance of the Crimson Moon disrupted their plans, causing both of these routes to fail!" "The Crimson Moon universe is a disaster!"Li Hao seemed to be very regretful."Otherwise, the blood Emperor's plan would have probably succeeded the day the sword venerable comprehended the Dao and opened the great Dao universe. Both sides would have been happy and satisfied. They would have completed all their plans!"He shook his head. The invasion of the Crimson Moon great cosmos had caused these two top-notch existences to fail!Even Li Hao felt sorry for them!Although the new Dao universe had benefited him, Li Hao felt that it would be more interesting if the sword venerable created it himself. In fact, there might not be any interference between the two. What the sword venerable wanted was to create it himself, not the kind that was born naturally.However, since the sword Saint had comprehended it to this extent ... Perhaps he had really created a new Dao universe all these years!"Ying Hongyue is just a pawn to the red moon Emperor! To li daoheng, it was to weaken venerable sovereigns, and at the same time, it was to take the saber of the blood Emperor and the cat! What role did Zheng Yu play in this?"Then, he thought of the song from the past, the young master of the Zheng family dragging him down ...The young master of the Zheng family was a burden ... If this song was passed down by li daoheng, it was definitely not a simple perfunctory song. Perhaps it really had such a meaning. Who was Zheng Yu a burden?The eight great families?And it was his, li daoheng 's?Or someone else 's?Zheng Yu, this half-step sovereign ... The more one interacted with him, the more one would feel that he was stupid! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, could a foolish half-Emperor easily become one?Could it be that he was still stabilizing his power when in fact, it had not been shaken at all?He had even secretly protected Ying Hongyue and indulged her. He knew about the knife under star suppression city, but he still indulged Ying Hongyue. The moment the flying sword immortal came out of the city to save the people was the result of his indulgent behavior!Perhaps he already knew that the flying sword immortal was Ying Hongyue!Li Hao laughed."Although I've seen through a lot, but ... It seems to be getting more and more interesting. I want to know, who exactly is the young master of the Zheng family dragging down?""Li Hao ... You ... What are you talking about?" Jian Shu couldn't hold it in anymore.Li Hao came back to his senses and smiled."Sword city is a good place. I came here and solved many things that I couldn't understand before! Thanks a lot!"“……”Go to hell!We didn't even talk much! Li Hao laughed,"what did li daoheng leave behind?" Why are the three of you in such a sorry state?"“……”The sword tree didn't want to speak.At this moment, it was the stone who said gloomily,""We didn't say anything, and you already know what was left behind?"Li Hao explained,"li daoheng should know of your existence, but he didn't kill you on purpose." The three of you are very important. One of you is the tree that revered sword has been cultivating on, the other should be the whetstone for his sword, and the last one is the city Lord seal of sword city ... In fact, he needs you to sharpen his sword! All these years, the three of you have probably been attacking the things he left behind ... In reality, you were just sharpening his sword!""The three of you working together ... You're a perfect match to Polish your swords! A Saint weapon, if given to you three to Polish for a hundred thousand years, has a chance of becoming a monarch weapon!"“……”The three of them couldn't accept this!The sword tree was a little angry,"nonsense!" In his eyes, the swordstone is dead, the city Lord seal is broken, and my Dao is broken ... It's impossible for us to be revived!"Therefore, it couldn't accept Li Hao's explanation.The three of us have been polishing li daoheng's sword for a hundred thousand years!This was impossible!Li Hao said softly,"let me think ... Li daoheng might not want to use someone else's sword. He ... Might have hidden a sword here. A sword that belongs to him!" The three of you are polishing his sword! His own sword! Even if it was only the Heavenly king's sword at first ... Now that you've blessed and polished it for 100000 years, once it completely devours the eight divine weapons and the eight main cities ... Not only will it be unparalleled in battle power, it will also be able to create its own unparalleled sword!""So ... The three of you have been fighting with the same sword all these years!"“……”The three of them didn't say a word, but the sword tree phantom trembled and even showed signs of collapsing.Obviously, Li Hao had guessed it right!As for Li Hao, he wasn't just guessing. The moment he saw the three of them, he thought that the three of them joining forces was a must for him to sharpen his sword!If li daoheng wasn't good at forging, or if he felt that the sword he forged was full of craftsmanship, then these three experts would naturally be used to forge a sword. It was simply a match made in heaven!The three swordsmen weren't even human. They were born with the sword intent of the venerable sword ... Li Hao felt that it was a pity that such existences were not used to sharpen his sword!Of course, it was too hurtful!But this was the truth.Otherwise, the entire city would have died, but these three wouldn 't?They really thought li daoheng was blind!Li Hao thought quickly and said,"where is the most suitable place to sharpen the sword ... The residence of the sword Supreme!" A place to comprehend the great Dao! There was a high chance that his sword was placed there. That place could even lead straight to the core of sword city. There was no other place more suitable than this place to sharpen his sword! Therefore, there must be a residence for the revered sword in the entire sword city. There must be! It might not be on the surface, but on a deeper level ... You three must know!"

"There is also the influence of the sword saint's Dao intent there ... My God, if this sword can devour sword city ... I suspect it will be much more powerful than the starry sky sword!"“……”It was extremely quiet.At this moment, the Dao hearts of the three experts seemed to have collapsed, and they couldn't extricate themselves. The rocks even cracked, and cracks appeared on the city Lord seal. The tree stump left by the sword tree also seemed to be cracking!Li Hao's words ... Had really hurt them!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ We've struggled for a hundred thousand years ... And you're telling us that we're just ... Sharpening swords for others!To forge the number one sword in the world!Most importantly, if Li Hao and Li daoheng had nothing to do with each other, and it was only his speculation, then ... It meant that this person had seen through everything with a single glance, and they were ignorant and had helped the enemy sharpen their swords for a hundred thousand years!For the past one hundred thousand years, they had always felt that they could destroy all of li daoheng's plans. They had always felt that they had paid a great price to weaken li daoheng and kill him ...But Li Hao told them that it was all a joke!This ... How could it not destroy his Dao heart?The sword intent spread, and the three heavily injured Saints felt like they were about to fall!It was as if their faith, their pillar of support, and the confidence that had supported them for 100000 years had collapsed.Li Hao sighed.In fact, he didn't have to say it, but even if he didn 't, these people would understand sooner or later. If he really forged a sword for the other party, the consequences might be even more serious.At this moment, Li Hao let out a breath, and his voice was like a great Bell, spreading the sound of Dao from his mouth."The three of you are all loyal men! As a swordsman, he should have a strong heart! It's just some tribulations, and it'll be spring after we get through it!""The other party's plan has failed. If we destroy his plan, seize his sword, and use it to kill him, we'll be digging our own grave!""At this moment, the other party's sword is still there. A hundred thousand years of sharpening a sword may not necessarily be his sword! The three of you have actually wavered the faith of a hundred thousand years for a sword that has yet to be determined ... If the sword venerable knew this, I'm afraid he would be disappointed!"The sound of the great Dao reverberated!At this moment, the three of them were somewhat clear-headed, and the sword tree muttered,""That's true ... Even if what you said is true, this sword isn't completed yet! It also doesn't belong to li daoheng. Taking this sword will make him lose both his wife and his Army!"The next moment, Jian Shu's voice was a little sharp."How do we obtain this sword?"“……”Li Hao said gloomily,"I don't know where it is. I don't know anything. You ... Are asking me?" Shouldn't I be the one asking you? Where did the sword Saint live? Where's the sword? What was his strength? Does it have a spirit?""You ..." The sword tree suddenly felt extremely bitter."You ... Really guessed all this just from listening to some simple words from us?""No, it's because I've been experiencing all of this ... I know a lot of things that you don 't! You've provided me with some key clues, and you've turned some of my previous guesses into facts! Do you understand?"Alright!Although it was still very hurtful, his words made them feel a little better."Why do humans always like to scheme?" the stone's voice was still as loud as Thunder. You're already very powerful, so why ... Do you still have to scheme like this?""Because I'm not strong enough!" Li Hao said with a smile."Ah?"Li Hao laughed,"the strong don't scheme, and those who scheme don't count as the strong!" You see, li daoheng has been scheming all this time. Not strong enough! People like venerable the sword and the human King were too lazy to scheme ... If you have a scheme, I'll break it with a sword and a saber! If the Crimson Moon wants to fight, I'll take the initiative to fight and annihilate the enemy in the outer realms! This is what the strong are like. There's nothing we can do about the weaker ones like li daoheng ... They're not the best, and they have powerful enemies they can't deal with. What can we do if we don't plan?""Take me for example. If I had the strength of venerable the sword and the others ... I could kill them all with one sword strike and everything would be over!"Li Hao chuckled and said,"then why do I have to figure out the enemy's thoughts bit by bit?" It was very tiring! In fact, when the strong are weak, they will also think about these things, but after they become strong, they don't care about it anymore. It's more tiring than breaking it in one move!""You mean ... As long as we are strong enough, we don't need to care about all this?" the giant seal asked. "Of course!""Then why would the strong be tricked by the weak?""The strong are so strong ..." The big seal retorted."The weak schemed against the strong, and the strong and the weak also schemed against each other. Why are we tricked by the weak when we are strong?"“……”Li Hao was stunned for a while. That made sense!After a long time, he smiled bitterly."That's probably because the strong aren't strong enough. In addition, they're born in hardship and die in peace and happiness ... They feel that they're very strong and don't need to care about it anymore. So ... Some people will fail in an easy task! You've all experienced a lot, so you should understand why heroes are born in troubled times. In times of chaos, when everyone was in danger, they would think of solutions and use their brains. In times of peace ... Why was it so difficult to produce such a figure? Because ... You're already satisfied!" The three of them reluctantly accepted this response."Then I'll take you to the residence of the sword Saint," Jian Shu said with a sigh."You don't doubt me anymore?""Is there a need to doubt?"Jian Shu said bitterly,'if it's really as you said, that you and Li daoheng are on the same side, then the three of us ... Do we have any chance to resist? We're not revered sword artists, we can't defeat all of you with our strength ... Maybe you're right, just take a gamble. If you win, you'll make a huge profit!"Li Hao smiled. At this moment, his smile was brilliant. "That's right! But ..."Even if he did encounter the other party's sword, he might not be easy to deal with! I'm more worried about something. Although he's trapped in the Dao universe by me and can't be allowed to go outside, if he can really walk out and enter the sealed land ... I'll be in trouble!"This place didn't restrict one's strength.Otherwise, the venerable sovereigns would have been trapped and killed long ago!At this moment, Jian Shu seemed to have found some confidence. "It's fine. He used to be able to enter and leave easily. Not long ago, a woman came and took away the base he entered and left from. Now ... He may not be able to enter easily. Even if he does, he will probably be as troublesome as you!"Li Hao was dazed for a moment. Then, he suddenly burst into laughter!I forgot about this!The moon itself!It was taken away by that idiot Queen!After laughing for a while, his expression suddenly froze."So, that guy can enter and leave that Half Moon at will?""Right!"Li Hao exhaled. Queen ... You look safe, but you're actually more dangerous than anyone else!Last time, li daoheng didn't reveal it at all ... Perhaps this guy wanted to enter the truth Dao universe through the Dao Meridian in the Queen's body. This guy had bad intentions!He should have been able to figure it out, but he had thought that the moon had been taken away by the Queen. Perhaps it would no longer have that effect after leaving this place.It seemed that he had been too careless.However, it was also a good thing ... The other party had schemed against the Queen, but they had lost the base inside the seal. Li Hao couldn't help but laugh again. The foolish Queen seemed to have helped him again by accident this time!As expected, the enemy's pig teammate was his own godly teammate.Queen, very good!Maybe I should be more polite to her ... Forget it, I'm afraid that if I'm too polite to her, she'll be touched and come to me. Then I'll be finished.Li Hao shook his head slightly and dispelled this stupid idea.Queen ... Please don't have any thoughts of seeking refuge with me. I'm afraid.

Chapter 2323 Suicide (1)
Li Hao followed the three remaining experts, who were somewhat strange.In his heart, he kept thinking.He had obtained many things from his trip to sword city, and silver Moon no longer held any secrets from Li Hao. Of course, there were still some questions that he had yet to find an answer to.However, this did not affect the overall situation.All in all, the venerable sovereign who was sealed had the least tricks up his sleeve. Of course, he was the strongest.After all, he had come in abruptly.Originally, they had planned to break through in one fell swoop, but they didn't have much thought. More than five venerable sovereigns had come to deal with two venerable sovereigns ... The result didn't look too optimistic. It was possible that the others had been killed.Outside the Stargate, there was a high probability that the neo martial artists would win.If Red Moon had won, she would have come in and attacked neo martial's territory.Only when the new martial arts team won, the frontline might need the support of the sword Master, so the sword Master left.Of course, all of this was just his own deduction.The war in the outside world might have ended long ago.He was only afraid that ... These people would still be fighting in the outside world!This wasn't scary. What was scary was fighting outside the Stargate ...It was said that the flow of time in the chaos was different. If 100000 years had passed here, only a few days had passed in the outside world ... The venerable sovereigns were still fighting ... If they rushed out and the venerable sovereigns were fighting outside ... It would be a big problem!Li Hao shook his head and felt like laughing.He was laughing at himself for worrying too much!Currently, Silver Moon still had a lot of internal problems to deal with, yet he was actually thinking about matters outside."What's wrong with you?"The woman in the form of the sword tree was a little confused. You're still smiling at such a dangerous time?Was this person crazy?Was he not worried at all?It said solemnly,"that sword must have a spirit!" The three of us have been fighting against the other party for many years. Just as you said, the other party is getting stronger and stronger, while we ... Are getting weaker and weaker! This sword didn't need anyone to control it. It already had the power of a Heavenly King! In fact ... He's even stronger!" Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  It was extremely solemn,'according to what you've said, perhaps you're just letting us Polish it, so it'll become even stronger! A divine weapon with spirituality ... Could actually be regarded as an authentic cultivator! For example, you should have seen the Wang family's Black Tortoise shield. It's at the level of a Saint! The other party was only a holy weapon back then ... Then, do you think this sword is a Heavenly King weapon or a half-sovereign weapon?"A weapon that did not possess a spirit and was not controlled by its master was actually very weak.Even if it was a Heavenly King weapon or a monarch weapon, such as the blood Emperor's blade, it had no master and no life. It was only a monarch weapon that was controlled by someone. It would be very powerful. Without someone controlling it ... Its power alone was not very strong.There should be hope of directly taking down the Heavenly King!However ... If it had a spirit, like the old turtle, the Heavenly King weapon would have the battle power of a Heavenly King, the Saint weapon would have the battle power of a Saint, and the same was true for the sovereign weapon ... It might be weaker than the same level of human race.However, it was definitely not a problem for a Heavenly King to fight a Saint! With a spirit, they could be treated as real cultivators.Without a spirit, it would be a proper weapon that needed its master to control.Li Hao nodded.Indeed, if there was only the weapon here ... It meant that li daoheng was very confident that no one could take the weapon away. This confidence meant that the sword at least had the power of a Heavenly King. He was underestimating his opponent.Intermediate Heavenly King stage, advanced Heavenly King stage, or even pinnacle Heavenly King stage ... It wasn't impossible.The current Li Hao had almost completed the cultivation of the third level of Dao integration, 108 meridians, and the three major cycles. He was roughly at the peak of the late-stage Saint realm. Of course, as a new Dao cultivator, he had some tricks up his sleeve, so he could still deal with a fake Heavenly King.Therefore, he had always dealt with the Heavenly Kings one-on-one.This was Li Hao's combat power.He seemed to be in the Heavenly King primary stage.The ability to skip ranks wasn't too powerful.Compared to some geniuses, Li Hao's ability to fight above his level ... Had always been mediocre. It was said that the ancient kings could fight across several levels and even kill powerful enemies.As for Li Hao ... He rarely crossed stages to battle. At the peak of the late stage of the Saint realm, he could only find a few Heavenly Kings in the early stage to fight.And this point was actually what his teacher had said at the beginning ... As long as his realm was high, there was no need for him to cross realms to fight.As long as I plan well ... My opponents will always be at the same level.Or even lower! I can crush you in terms of realm!Thus, Li Hao's battles had always been extremely smooth. The most dangerous battle so far was the Battle of Saints at the sun and moon level against the boundless city. At that time, there was no room for strategy.Today ... His opponent was at least an early Heavenly King.However, he now had a trump card in his hand. It was a sword that contained some real longevity sword intent!However ... It was hard to say whether this sword could deal with the other sword."Where does the sword Saint live?"Li Hao asked.The sword tree looked ahead, which was a wasteland. It said,""The residence of the sword Saint is within the formation! They were afraid of being disturbed ... And many people wanted to pay their respects to the sword Saint, so they used a formation to conceal their residence. ""As for the residence ... It's connected to the real core of sword city ..." He thought."Is the sword city really the starry sky sword?""I don't know."Jian Shu shook his head. He was not trying to hide it, so he explained,"In fact, the sword venerable hasn't used a sword for a long time. In the late stage of neo martial realm, there aren't many battles. The sword venerable doesn't usually use a sword. Even if he does ... He would use the sword in your hand! However, under normal circumstances, it would at most be used to guide some juniors and not used against enemies! That's why I can't give you an answer when you ask me if the sword city is the real starry sky sword. "

Chapter 2324 Suicide (2)
Li Hao nodded slightly.He didn't need a sword.At this level, the sword was indeed a kind of restraint.Everything could be used as a sword!However, Li Hao concluded that sword city was most likely the real starry sky sword.While Li Hao was thinking, the three special creatures were actually observing him.He was filled with curiosity about Li Hao.Although he had been in despair before ... He had thought that he wanted to die after working for his enemy for 100000 years. However, after this person had consoled him with a few words and added to that, he had been extremely calm and even smiled just now ... He suddenly felt that it was actually nothing.This guy was actually so calm.Was Li Hao strong?They had just had a brief fight with Li Hao ... He wasn't too strong. At least in their eyes, he was on par with them in terms of level and strength, just a little stronger.This guy ... Was he really not nervous?Jian Shu didn't ask, but the stone's voice was not soft, and it was still muffled."You're Li Hao, right?""Yes.""May I ask for your names?" Li Hao smiled."Just call me rock!""I'm called the sword seal!""Everyone calls me the sword tree ... The name doesn't matter."Li Hao nodded and smiled."I'm fine with it. A name is indeed just a title.""Are you ... The most powerful human in this era?" the stone took over."It should be,"Li Hao laughed."Perhaps ... There was a guy who could stand shoulder to shoulder with me in the past. But now, he can 't. Not counting those old guys, I should be the strongest!"As for the Queen ... She wasn't a match for him.As for the king of Dali ... He would think about it after he absorbed the skeleton. Even if he did, he was not an opponent.It didn't matter if they were in the same realm, or if they were slightly stronger ... As long as they weren't well-versed in both literature and martial arts, they would eventually be tricked by him."The sword tree said that you've only cultivated for a year?""Yes,"Li Hao nodded and said,"however, we don't have to calculate it based on time. In the first 100000 years, the world was silent, and the great DAOs were destroyed ... We can actually eliminate these 100000 years. They're not very useful! Some people were lucky! Time isn't the only thing ..."Although he had only trained for a short time, Li Hao was not interested in making comparisons. He just wanted to increase the stakes when some people did not believe him.The so-called cultivation time ... One year now might be equivalent to a hundred thousand years in the past!This era was the era of breaking records.With the recovery of the world and the birth of all DAOs, everyone had an innate Dao body. The basic conditions were too strong.A hundred thousand years of heaven and earth's accumulation had begun to counterattack. This was no small matter."You ... Are you confident?" the stone asked again. If you're not confident, why don't we discuss how to deal with it? Are we going there now?"There was no planning at all!What are you doing up there?I'm getting a little nervous from your words. Li Hao was still smiling,'let's take a look first. The other party hasn't finished polishing yet, plus my realm isn't high, so the possibility of killing us is not high. At most, we'll be seriously injured. As long as we don't die, we can discuss again at any time. "What the hell is this?In Li Hao's opinion, there was no point in talking on paper. It was enough to know the general situation of the other party. Besides ... Did the three of you really understand that sword?The information you gave me might not be reliable.If I really believed him, that would be a huge problem.……Soon, the few of them ... One person with three spirits arrived at a slightly empty place. Jian Shu said,""This is where the formation is."Li Hao opened his sword eyes and nodded slightly.He saw it.A light barrier enveloped the nearby area.He walked straight to a transparent part of the light barrier and pointed at it. ""This is the entrance?"The three of them had mixed feelings when they saw the golden light in Li Hao's eyes and the longevity sword intent he had displayed earlier. This was the standard of a sword venerable. In addition, Li Hao was wearing the starry sky sword ... They might even believe it if he said that he was the reincarnation of a sword venerable.Sword eye, sword intent, sword ..."You guys go in first!"At this moment, Jian Shu became a little embarrassed,""It ... Is it really that strong?"He wasn't afraid in the past, but now, he was a little worried.Li Hao laughed,"swordsmen press forward with indomitable will!" Let's go!"When the three of them heard this, they did not hesitate any longer. Since they had already said so ... Let's go!The formation was activated, and the three experts instantly merged into the formation. Li Hao followed him in.There was no spinning. This time, it was very stable, as if they had crossed a wall. Soon, a small space came into view. There was nothing luxurious and spectacular here, just a small courtyard.It had a classical charm to it.The small courtyard was not too big. It was squarish and the courtyard walls separated the courtyard from the surroundings. There was also a plaque on the small courtyard with three large words written on it-!Li Hao's heart moved. This name ... Didn't match the style of swordsmen.Below these three words, there was a line of small words that appeared but could not be seen clearly.The sword eye appeared and he could barely see it clearly."I don't ask for Jian Wushuang, but I ask for longevity, peerless and peerless to stay!"Unrivaled warrior?Li Hao was stunned. This ... What an arrogant tone!In the next moment, he seemed to realize something and his heart trembled!The human King!The arrogant human King, this must have been written by the human King himself!The human King had been here before? Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  That's right ... It was as if the human King had come here at the beginning of the world and wanted to take back the world. In the end, he gave up because he wanted to leave it to venerable the sword.It was just that ... This ... What a big tone!Of course, the human King had this right.

Chapter 2325 Suicide (3)
Anping residence!He didn't ask for the art of swordsmanship, he only asked for the sword venerable to live a long life, and the inscription was "unrivaled ..." Anyone who saw this plaque would only have one thought. The person who left his name was telling the person who saw it that he couldn't be touched!No matter who you are, he has an invincible master behind him. If you want to deal with this person, come and find me!That kind of overbearing arrogance, that kind of arrogance, that was afraid that the world would not know that this person is someone I value very much. Combat strength is not important, longevity is the key!If anything happens to him, I'll kill your entire family ...Yes, this was the feeling.Even if the other party didn't say anything, just this line of words ... Was enough.Li Hao was a little dazed. There was no trace of the great Dao, nor were there any afterimages. There was only a kind of unparalleled dominance that seeped from the bones. Do you dare to touch venerable sword?Li Hao looked at it in a daze.Do you dare to touch my teacher?Anyone who saw this plaque would have killed the human King.He might not dare!"And I ... Actually have a teacher too. But my teacher ... Is dead.BOOM!Li Hao didn't look at the battle ahead. He only stared at the sign. At this moment, he suddenly felt a pain in his heart.He was ... Not willing to think about it.However, at this moment, he suddenly felt a little dazed and absent-minded.It was said that venerable the sword and the King of Man supported each other. Along the way, they had gone through many hardships. He had once seen in the "legend of Nanjiang" that during the neo martial era, during the battle of Nanjiang, the King of Man and venerable the sword went into the catacombs together. The King of Man risked his life to save venerable the sword, who was almost dead.As for revered sword, in order to protect the king, he killed gods and Buddhas in his way. He conquered the world and even dared to draw his sword against a Supreme martial artist!Later on, the human King entrusted his younger sister to him ... He asked venerable the sword to escort his younger sister to another universe to take refuge. In the face of danger, venerable the sword took Zhang an and the others, along with the human King's younger sister, to the distant land of chaos to protect her alone.The two of them stumbled along the way ... But from the beginning to the end, venerable the sword seemed to be alive, unlike the Supreme martial artist and the others, who had actually died once and were eventually resurrected by the human King.In the entire neo martial era, there were very few people who had not died.Countless thoughts surged into his mind at this moment.The great Dao was emotionless ... But this emotionless was not the same as that emotionless."My teacher ... I was unable to protect him.He was the only one who protected me, and I ... Was unable to protect him.At this moment, Li Hao was dazed by this short line of words. Ancient king ...He was a real man!And me?I ... On my way here, I've actually lost many people. Many, many people who took care of me have all left.Human King, why is it that when I see your words ... I think of myself and feel that I am very useless?It was a little bitter!It really ... Made people envious and jealous! He was in a daze for a moment and didn't look at the words again ... These words didn't have any charm of the great Dao. They were left for the enemy to see. He knew in his heart that he couldn't leave anything for the enemy.It was just used to deter others!Whoever could attack the lair of the sword venerable would have to think twice after seeing this line of words.In front of him, the three brutal swords!In the yard, there was a long sword that looked similar to the starry sky sword, but it was not exactly the same. It was sharp and strange. At this moment, countless shadows of the long sword appeared from all directions and surrounded the three experts.Crackling, every sword strike was a direct confrontation with the three-crippled!Li Hao watched in silence.A direct confrontation!He was sharpening his sword!Their sword intents collided. That sword ... Li Hao's eyes flickered slightly. This sword didn't use its full strength at all. Sure enough, it had been actively colliding with the three experts, grinding against their sword intents.He was definitely sharpening his sword!As if sensing Li Hao's spying, sword energies suddenly shot out of the yard and headed straight for Li Hao.Li Hao dodged.He didn't make a move.Sword shadows filled the void. This sword intent wasn't the only thing that existed here. There was also a familiar longevity sword intent. It was because of this sword intent that even a few Saints couldn't hurt this place.This was the true sovereign's dojo!In addition, with that plaque, even the battle between the Heavenly Kings would not be able to destroy everything here.The sword shadow attacked.One against four!This was already the battle strength of a Heavenly King.The longsword pierced through the air. Li Hao moved his feet and dodged the countless sword shadows. When the longsword saw that Li Hao had dodged, it instantly shot out more sword intents from the courtyard toward Li Hao, carrying a cold, crazy, and murderous intent.They blocked Li Hao from all directions!It seemed to be angry, so why didn't he fight it?In the yard, the three experts kept shouting, but the sword was silent. It was as if it was a sword without a spirit. The only reason it could release sword intent was because of the formation.Bang Bang Bang! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Sharp sounds were heard continuously.Outside the courtyard, Li Hao's eyes flickered as he looked toward the small courtyard ... At this moment, he vaguely saw a golden sword standing on a futon!That sword ... Was like a person, also cultivating!Li Hao was slightly shocked!At this moment, a sword on the futon in the room suddenly opened its eyes and exploded with a strong killing intent.At this moment, it seemed to have sensed Li Hao's spying!Li Hao's expression changed slightly. No, this sword ... F * ck, could it have been refined into another clone by li daoheng?

2326 Chapter 389
"Retreat!"Li Hao roared and grabbed, shattering the void.Inside the house, the long sword slashed out!As if sensing something, he was about to kill Li Hao with one strike. A powerful sword light caught the three experts in an instant. At this moment, a special force burst out, and time seemed to stop for a moment.The longsword pierced through the sky, but Li Hao instantly grabbed the three experts and disappeared.In the blink of an eye, he had exited the formation.The moment he disappeared, BOOM!The long sword slashed out!The sword was so powerful that even the stable courtyard trembled slightly. Soon, the sword disappeared, and a thin young man walked out.The long sword spiritualized!The young man's eyes were filled with a sharp sword light. He looked outside and silently thought about something.……As for the formation, bloody holes instantly appeared on Li Hao's arm.Blood burst out!Li Hao's expression changed slightly as he looked into the array. I didn't underestimate him ... But I didn't expect that he was still actively cultivating, not just passively ... The sword can also be like this?"The three disabled were still a little confused. Just now, they had been caught by Li Hao and felt how terrifying he was, but Li Hao suddenly became so afraid ... "How is it?" Jian Shu asked hurriedly."Very strong!"Li Hao looked at the formation and said, he didn't come out ...This formation wasn't meant to stop the enemy.It was just a simple cover.The sword did not come out.Why didn't he come out?While he was still thinking, stone said gloomily,""Are they very powerful?""Very powerful!"At this point, Li Hao's expression changed again.""This doesn't feel good ... Could this sword be devouring the starry sky sword?"Why didn't this sword come out?This sword city ... Could it be that it was being devoured by the other party?If that was the case ... It would be troublesome.It was more troublesome than he had expected! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "At least mid to late Heavenly King stage! Or even ... The peak of the Heavenly King realm!"As soon as he said that, the three disabled were shocked.Was he that strong?Although Li Hao had guessed so ... Was he really that powerful?"Then what do we do?"Although they had only known Li Hao for less than a day, the three of them now regarded Li Hao as their backbone ... This was a very interesting change. Of course, since the three of them didn't notice this, Li Hao didn't care, either, because he was already used to it. Li Hao quickly calculated something.This sword was probably absorbing the power of sword city.The residence of the sword venerable was most likely related to the core of the sword city.In the residence, there was still the sword will of the sword Saint, which might have been absorbed by the other party.This sword wasn't just a sword that had formed a spirit. In all likelihood, it could even be considered li daoheng's clone, because it could cultivate on its own. It was very difficult for a divine weapon to ... Or rather, Li Hao had almost never seen a divine weapon cultivate on its own.Including the old turtle!If the old turtle wanted to become stronger, it would be very difficult. The only way was to re-forge it. If the material was fixed, it would be best to find a top-notch blacksmith to re-forge its body and make it stronger. Then, it would devour a large amount of Origin Energy or other forces. Only then would it have a chance of advancing."Good treasure!""A divine weapon that can evolve on its own ... A treasure that countless people dream of!" Li Hao mumbled.The three disabled were worried to death.Why don't you think of a way to deal with it? is there any use in praising the other party?Could he praise his opponent to death?Li Hao licked his lips and laughed. He laughed a little crazily. I've underestimated this fellow ... Are the three of you afraid of death?"“……”"You talk business!" Jian Shu said anxiously."It's very difficult to deal with it ... But it's also very simple ... It's just that ... You might die!""Just say it!""Suppress the venerable sovereigns!"“……”He understood!The three powerhouses were stunned.At this moment, the three of them understood. For a moment, their true bodies trembled. Another one had gone crazy?Li Hao laughed, let's test the weight of a venerable sovereign! This was the first reason. Second, this sword ... Was difficult to deal with! I suspect that it has already invaded sword city by quite a bit ... Only by heavily damaging this sword and sword city ... Can there be any hope of stripping it away! It has already discovered me. Although I look weak ... But ... Just in case, it might come out and find trouble with me!"Li Hao was excited."Let's make a quick agreement ... And take action immediately. I'm more curious ... What kind of strength does a true venerable sovereign still have even after being sealed for 100000 years?""You're crazy!"The sword tree could not help but roar,"it will be destroyed!" A true venerable sovereign ... Was unbelievably powerful! If he was that easy to deal with, he would have been killed long ago. Why would he wait until today?"Li Hao licked his lips."No, I want to try ... I'm not going crazy, I'm just testing it. If this thing is really a clone ... Then it'll be interesting. Maybe ... Someone will come in person!""That's right!" At this point, his eyes flickered."Previously, it was only an insignificant injury to him. If this sword is destroyed, perhaps ... He really won't be able to hold back!""How do I control sword city and return it to its original place?"The three spirits looked at each other, all in pain.Don't mess around!A venerable sovereign!"I can't win against it!"Li Hao said honestly,'if it's the early Heavenly King stage, the mid Heavenly King stage, or even the late Heavenly King stage ... I'll try! However, from the looks of it, the other party was only showing off a small part of his skills. He might really be close to a pseudo-Emperor, not someone I can match! I won't take any risks if I can deal with it alone!"

Chapter 2327 Suicide (Part 5)
"Is this the only way?" Jian Shu said in pain."Yes,""AI!"He sighed and said,"at the moment, the sword seal can still control sword city, but ... Will it come out and stop us?."Li Hao shook his head."There's a high chance that he won 't. Of course, the probability is small. This guy ... Might have entered a critical period. A critical period for him to devour sword city!"He said no more and looked at the big seal."Let's not waste any time. Hurry up. Let's go back to where we came from and get close to the venerable sovereign. When we get close, we'll enter the eight trigrams Formation and charge in a suicidal manner!"“……”The seal trembled, and the next moment, sword city suddenly flew back!Sword city had been flying toward the depths of the universe, away from the venerable sovereign, after Li Hao's arrival, but now ... It was back again.……In the small courtyard.The young man with the long sword seemed to have sensed it and frowned slightly.Under his feet, a powerful sword intent was constantly overflowing.He wanted to walk out ... But when he turned to look at the small house, he hesitated. If he walked out, he would stop all his previous efforts. After so many years, he had finally invaded the core ...Furthermore, sword city itself was resisting!Damn it!The young man who was transformed from a long sword kept thinking. Who ... Was this person?What kind of energy was it that stopped him for a moment?The sword slashed down. Although it was not his full power, it definitely contained the power of a Heavenly King. However, it was easily blocked by the other party, and he felt the space freeze."Sword city ... There's actually a newcomer."He mumbled and his eyes changed. The only person who could come to sword city at this moment ... Was the starry sky sword ... He roughly knew who it was. However, the last time his main body came was a long time ago and he did not know about the news of the outside world.He knew that this should be the test subject ... Or a new person born from the family of the test subject.However, the other party had actually entered sword city."At the critical moment, this suddenly appeared ... Is this the counterattack of the heaven and earth? Or is it the counterattack of Sword Saint Yu Yun?"She muttered angrily.He had been fine for so many years, but at the most critical moment, the other party came. Now that sword city was moving, where were they going?Where could this place go?The place where the venerable sovereign was sealed?Would he?If that's the case ... You want to take me down with you? Many thoughts flashed through his mind. A sword was like a real person, and it was not stupid.Should he walk out and kill these fellows, or ... Should he stay and continue with his plan, stopping them from committing suicide?Venerable sovereigns were the strongest in Silver Moon.If sword city really rushed in and fought with venerable sovereigns, they might not have a good end.If he completely devoured sword city, there might still be hope for the half-crippled venerable sovereigns who were sealed ...However, the young man quickly thought of something.If ... He took the opportunity to deal a heavy blow to sword city, would it be easier to devour? Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ The resistance of sword city was extremely strong!Over the years, they had only invaded some of the cities and had not taken complete control of them. Otherwise, sword city would not have moved at all.As these thoughts flashed through his mind, he suddenly laughed.His smile was extremely similar to Li Hao 's. It was somewhat crazy, somewhat like the madness of a gambler ... If ... He really attacked and didn't die, sword city would suffer a heavy blow. Then, could he take the opportunity to swallow this real starry sky sword?The hope was very high!Of course, the danger was great too!……Outside.Li Hao had been restless the whole time. Even the sword intent in the sword in his hand had been circulating. He was prepared to attack with all his might if the other party really came out to stop him.However, after waiting for a while, there was no movement.Li Hao was not happy."Li daoheng ..." He said softly after a long while,"you're just a clone, but you're already so crazy. Are you so gambled?"He probably knew what the other party was thinking.If he were in his shoes, would he stop the refinement or take a gamble? the Thearch had damaged the sword city, and he would successfully devour it?Of course, he would bet on the latter!The latter might be able to save me a lot of time. Li Hao's expression was grave. This was bad. It wasn't that this guy wasn't prepared, but that he was. He had the same thoughts as Li Hao. Such an opponent was difficult to deal with."Follow me!"Li Hao said and took the three experts away. The three spirits quickly followed, all very nervous.Where to?This is sword city, and we are the most familiar with it. Where are you taking us?Li Hao circled left and right, and soon, he led the three of them into an area.The city Lord's mansion!The three of them were startled. What were they doing here?Li Hao Ran straight to the hall, and the three of them followed him in a hurry, still confused.Li Hao didn't say anything. He entered the main hall of the city Lord's mansion, closed the door, and said,""The city Lord's mansion is usually the center of the city, the core! If the other party makes a move, they will attack the city Lord's mansion at the first moment ... They will break through the city Lord's mansion!"We know that the three spirits are trembling!Do I need you to say that?"Venerable sovereigns are usually extremely arrogant!" "Three seniors, are you willing to play hide-and-seek with me?" Li Hao asked softly."What?""Let's hide and take a gamble. We'll bet that the venerable sovereign can destroy the city Lord's mansion with one strike and we won't die! If we don't die, when the venerable sovereign sees that sword city is still attacking ... He'll definitely find out where the sword is ... He'll bet ... That he'll do his best to deal with the sword!"He didn't die in one strike?The three spirits trembled, and the sword tree was a little mad."Did li daoheng send you to kill us? It's one thing for sword city to suppress venerable sovereigns, but you want to enter the city Lord's mansion and bet that the enemy's full-force attack will break the city Lord's mansion, and we will survive?"What are you thinking?Li Hao said softly,'a venerable sovereign's attack was only a half-crippled venerable sovereign ... We might not die if we hide well!' Don't be afraid, I'll protect you. As long as you don't die, that sword will take the initiative to attack ... With sword city half destroyed, the other party will definitely escape! There's still a chance of escaping, and once we do ... It'll be my battle with it. At that time, you'll be in charge of reinforcing sword city and driving it away from that damned place ..."The three half-crippled spirits wanted to cry but had no tears.Who the hell was this person?Should we trust him?Why was it that every word he said was so easy, but it only brought them endless fear?"You three can enter my starry sky sword ... As long as I'm alive, you three will be fine!" Li Hao said softly.The three spirits were talking to each other.After a long time, he made a decision. Jian Shu's tone was a little complicated."I don't know why I'm suddenly led by you. I even suspect that you're here to use sword city to attack the venerable sovereign ... But now, we don't seem to have any way out. Are you sure you're not here to harm people?"What a troublemaker!We've been quiet for so many years, but the moment you came, we've been taking risks with you time and time again.This guy was simply the second human King!"Seniors, you've misunderstood me ... It's alright. After this, the misunderstanding will be resolved."If he was alive, then it would be resolved.If he's dead ... We won't know the situation anymore, so naturally, it'll be lifted.The three spirits were helpless ... They could only choose to believe in Li Hao again. Step by step, they entered the starry sky sword and waited for their unknown fate.……At the same time.The venerable sovereign, who was still closing his eyes, suddenly opened his eyes and looked in one direction. Sword city, which had drifted away, had returned again.He frowned slightly.In the past, there had been some disturbances in sword city, but it would only happen once in many years. However, recently, there had been two instances of abnormalities in sword city. They had clearly drifted far away, but they had returned!It felt like ... Someone was controlling it from within the city!He looked in that direction and didn't say anything. He just watched in silence.Was this sword city going to play any more tricks?Gradually, sword city was getting closer and closer, and it was not far from the eight trigrams Formation.The eight trigrams Formation was the core of his seal.Once he left the eight trigrams array, he would be killed by the array.As long as he didn't come out, he would be an invincible venerable sovereign!As they got closer to sword city, he suddenly laughed with a hint of playfulness.This is getting interesting!Could it be that ... This city was going to enter the range of the formation this time?If that's the case ... Then this will be interesting. I won't be polite.He had long wanted to see if this city was the sword of the sword venerable. Now ... Was the chance finally here?He was getting closer and closer!The venerable sovereign, who had been sitting with his legs crossed, suddenly stood up and looked in the direction of sword city with a faint smile on his face. It seemed that ... He was really coming. If there was really someone in the city, was he tired of living?

Chapter 2328 Sword Of Time (1)
Sword city was approaching.Red Moon sovereign revealed a smile.Do you all, who are not venerable sovereigns, actually understand the power of venerable sovereigns?The eight trigrams Formation lit up.Eight illusionary figures appeared. Among them, the illusionary figure of the sword Master burst out with sword Qi, as if he had sensed the arrival of the sword city.At the same time.City Lord's mansion.Li Hao's expression was calm. Could he block the attack of a venerable sovereign?Probably not.Or rather, can I avoid it and not die?Who knows?'How much strength does this venerable sovereign still have? moreover, he's still sealed. If I can't even Dodge one attack and get killed, how can I fight against them in the future?'To the three spirits, it was a life-and-death battle, but to Li Hao ... It was just a basic test.He didn't even have the right to test the waters, and the seal was broken. It wouldn't be long before he could deal with a venerable sovereign.Without any hesitation, sword city charged at the seal.In an instant, a beam of heaven-cleaving sword Qi spread out and slashed toward the venerable sovereign!At this moment, Li Hao wasn't the only one controlling it. The sword and the seal were also under his control ...At this moment, the two sides seemed to have reached an invisible tacit understanding.He wanted to try the power of a venerable sovereign!……"You have guts!"Red Moon sovereign chuckled. He was really bold.There must be someone in the city who took the initiative to attack him."You ... How dare you look down on venerable sovereigns!"He didn't say anything else. At this moment, a huge hand covered the sky and the sun. Even the firmament and the universe were covered. Only the hand that covered the sky went straight to the center of the sword city.It was also where the city Lord's mansion was located!Boom! Boom! Boom!The eight trigrams Formation exploded with a powerful destructive power. The shadow of the sword Master instantly burst out a monstrous sword Qi and headed straight for the venerable sovereign!"Yes!" Sword city responded instantly, and a second wave of powerful sword Qi burst out.The two sword Qi swept across the world!Kachaa!The void turned into a mirror and was shattered by the venerable sovereign's palm. The huge palm destroyed the sword Qi that could kill a Heavenly King as if it was very easy. A Red Force filled the entire universe!Red Moon sovereign looked calm. His huge palm broke everything in front of him and directly hit the city Lord's mansion!BOOM!At this moment, a burst of sword energy soared into the sky as Li Hao slashed the firmament with his sword!Apart from the longevity sword intent, all his strength was in this sword!It was extremely powerful!He could kill a Heavenly King!"Kill!""Die!" Li Hao bellowed. Sword Qi pierced through the void, and the divine runes of the great Dao appeared. The huge palm in the sky fell directly. BOOM! Li Hao's sword intent exploded instantly!"Eh?" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ The venerable sovereign's voice could be heard faintly. This small person seemed to be the descendant of the Li family? It was him?BOOM!A shallow sword mark appeared on the giant palm. It was very weak. At this moment, Li Hao's sword couldn't even penetrate the palm.Li Hao raised his head. The boundless pressure seemed to be forcing him to kneel!In the face of venerable sovereigns ... In the face of Emperor pressure, you should kneel!But ... How could that be possible?Li Hao roared. His body was like a sharp sword as he soared into the sky. His palm was like a curtain that covered the sky. Li Hao charged forward, ignoring the other's pressure. Your pressure is not good!It wasn't even as strong as the saber of the blood Emperor!"Five birds sword!"With a low shout, the power of the five birds suddenly erupted from Li Hao's body. Mountains appeared, Tigers roared, willow trees spread, waves surged, and golden light illuminated the world!The five giant Dragons merged into the five birds, which were the five-element Dao meridians."Kill!"He shouted again and broke the world with one sword strike!BOOM!Ants that could shake the heavens, overestimating their own strength!With a loud bang, the huge recoil broke all the bones in Li Hao's body. He didn't just Dodge, he even wanted to take the initiative to charge and attack!It was like a Mantis trying to stop a chariot. The venerable sovereign was a little surprised and sneered.He ... Had drawn his sword at the venerable sovereigns!His courage was commendable! It was a pity ... That he was too weak.It would be a joke for such a weak guy to kill a venerable sovereign.The giant palm landed!Bang!The mayor's mansion was reduced to dust, Li Hao's physical body was shattered, and the sword in his hand was even broken. The three spirits appeared and instantly turned into dust. The sword tree phantom looked helpless and muttered,""I thought that I would at least have some results ... In the end ... I really came to die ..."I've overestimated you!With one blow, Li Hao was smashed into pieces by the venerable sovereign's palm, and the starry sky sword was broken. It could be seen that this sword ... Was not too strong.The entire city Lord's mansion turned into a huge black hole in an instant.It revealed the sword intent that was vaguely spreading from below."Dead?"At this moment, a young man mumbled. It was really a suicidal charge!It was unbelievable!This person ... Can actually make the three remnant spirits commit suicide with him. Does he want to kill me?He had originally wanted to see if the master of the starry sky sword had any other tricks up his sleeve ... However, he had not expected to be killed by a venerable sovereign in one strike. It was very powerful. The last sword attack had even left a mark on the venerable sovereign's hand. It was very weak, but it also felt like the skin had been torn.If it was more powerful, it could even leave a small wound on a venerable sovereign.It was already unbelievable!Venerable sovereigns were the limits of the world.However, at this moment ... The other party had been killed by a single palm.Red Moon sovereign laughed as well. This man had never dared to get close to him before, but he was so bold today!Of course, he had also noticed something.The next moment, he smiled,'it seems like he wants to use his death to exchange for yours! You do have some ability!"

Chapter 2329 Sword Of Time (2)
As soon as he finished speaking, the giant palm instantly fell.BOOM!Countless buildings in the entire sword city were instantly turned into ashes!The venerable swords that others couldn't destroy were turned into powder in an instant under the attack of a venerable sovereign. Even the concealing formation was broken, and the true appearance of the entire sword city was revealed in an instant!It was indeed a sword!At this moment, a small courtyard was still standing on top of the huge sword. On the small courtyard, the plaque flickered with light and blocked the destructive power.The venerable sovereign's eyes flickered slightly as he looked over.Li Hao didn't see anything, but at this moment, the venerable sovereign seemed to see a person, who was extremely wild.The human King!The neo martial King!At this moment, the long sword suddenly shone with a bright light. A young man holding a sword shouted and slashed out. This was the real starry sky sword!"Kill!"Just like Li Hao, he killed a venerable sovereign with his sword!He was like a god when he saw a venerable sovereign.Ordinary saints and Heavenly Kings would not dare to attack venerable sovereigns.But today, the two of them had drawn their swords and killed the venerable sovereign!This attack was much more powerful than Li Hao's previous one. Two sword auras burst out and collided with the huge palm. With a boom, the palm was cut open!"You've been sealed for so many years, is this all you can do?"the sword-wielding youth snorted.In the distance, Red Moon sovereign looked at him and smiled,""That's right, but ... Is that all?"In an instant, a second palm appeared!BOOM!Suppressing the heaven and earth, covering the sky with one hand. Suddenly, the palm clenched and covered the entire sword city. Red Moon Thearch said softly,""I'm indeed not as good as revered sword, but ... It's just a Broken Sword. Do you really think that this thing can kill me?"Was he underestimating venerable sovereigns?BOOM! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  The huge sword city was deformed by this palm. Cracking sounds could be heard as countless sword Qi burst out. At this moment, except for the area around the small courtyard, cracks appeared everywhere.As for the young man with the long sword, his expression did not change. Once again, an extremely powerful sword intent burst out. His sword pierced through the heavens and earth, and a bloody mark appeared on his palm!"Hmph!"Red Moon sovereign was slightly angry. How dare he!What a sharp sword Qi!He retracted his palm and turned it into a fist. He threw a punch at the area where the young man was. Before the punch reached him, countless sword Qi collapsed one after another. A venerable sovereign was a venerable sovereign. No matter how strong the young man was, he was still no match for him!In just an instant, the illusory figure of the youth trembled. Bang Bang Bang, his body began to shatter. There was no blood, only countless sword Qi overflowing. He muttered,"After so many years, he's still so powerful ... Venerable sovereign ..." Venerable sovereigns were indeed unrivaled.Reaching the heavens in a single step!No matter how powerful he was, even if he used the power of sword city, even if he used up all his sword Qi, even if ... He couldn't even withstand a single punch from his opponent. This was a venerable sovereign, a venerable sovereign that had been sealed for 100000 years!The young man's body collapsed and turned into a long sword. Cracks appeared on the long sword, but at this moment, the long sword didn't seem to care, because the entire sword city was also covered in cracks!It was a good thing!As long as he dodged this attack, he would be able to refine the real starry sky sword.However, he couldn't block the venerable sovereign's punch.However, the longsword didn't seem to be worried at all. Suddenly, the longsword trembled violently, with a sense of excitement.At the same time, the venerable sovereign laughed and said,""I knew you would come. You've got guts!"At this moment, the universe seemed to split open, and a man carrying a sword on his back appeared!It was not as Jian Shu had said, that the other party could not come after yueshen disappeared. It was just a little more complicated. When the long sword was drawn, the man with the sword sensed it and knew that he might have fought with a venerable sovereign.And so, he appeared.The man with the sword on his back didn't say anything. He drew his sword and slashed down from the sky. This sword illuminated the entire universe!The sword fell, and the universe seemed to be shattered!The huge fist and the sword light collided with each other!Silence!There was no loud sound. It was just that without any sound, countless voids collapsed and instantly turned into black holes. The weak force of the collision hit the sword city, and the sword city was instantly sent flying backward. It broke out of the seal in an instant and burst out, disappearing into the vast universe!The sword-carrying man's long sword was instantly shattered, and the venerable sovereign's giant fist disappeared. A deep, bloody gash appeared on his own hand.In the next moment, the venerable sovereign threw another punch indifferently!BOOM!The firmament was torn apart, and the great path universe seemed to be shaking. The man with the sword on his back had come through the great path universe. At this moment, a long sword appeared in the great path universe. The long sword fell into the hand of the man with the sword on his back, and he slashed again!BOOM!The long sword trembled and turned into countless stars in an instant, but many of them were broken. The sword-carrying man's body trembled, and the venerable sovereign punched again!"Li daoheng, you're not weak ... But ... You're not a venerable sovereign! Even if I'm sealed for 100000 years, I'm still not someone you can defeat!"At their level, they didn't need to be fancy.It was to be direct!One punch turned into tens of thousands of punches. Hong long long, the sword-carrying man kept spitting out blood. His body kept shattering as he retreated while vomiting blood. The great Dao universe was trembling and rapidly sealing!The venerable sovereign's eyes flickered, and he soared into the sky, as if he wanted to rush into the universe of the great path.At this moment, he suddenly turned around, and his expression changed.Behind him, the virtual shadow of the sword venerable seemed to have been accumulating power. Suddenly, it drew its sword and slashed!
