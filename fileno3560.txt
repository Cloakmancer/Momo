Li Hao smiled bitterly."I'm not being perfunctory. As for the lifespan ... Although I cultivate time, I have never mastered time. I can't give you a perfect answer. Why ... Are some creatures born with different lifespans?" This ... Makes me unable to answer!"And at this moment, long Zhan continued,"the so-called lifespan limit is not outside of the rules! And the laws had a spirit! There's only one reason why the life of your mole crickets is short-young master Ling!"Chunqiu was stunned. Young master Ling!Long Zhan looked at Li Hao."Everything has a spirit. According to what you said, Dao also has a spirit. Everything has a spirit, and spirit creates rules ... In a clan, some people have more spirit, and some people have less spirit. In reality, this is a kind of wisdom ... The higher the wisdom, the longer the lifespan you can obtain ..."The human King disagreed."The basic lifespan of humans is not as long as that of the chaos race. You, the chaos race, are a bunch of fools. Are you trying to flatter yourself?"“……”Long Zhan was depressed and somewhat angry.These words!Your race is the stupid one!Chunqiu was also a little unhappy. Was he saying that they were stupid?Alright ... A little.But ... You, the primal Chaos race, are so muddleheaded. How good are you?When they mentioned spirit, Li Hao was no longer silent. He immediately said,""On this point, what Daoist long Zhan said might not be entirely right, but there's some truth. Rules have spirits, and only with spirits will there be rules. Wisdom will give birth to rules, or rather, establish rules! The current chaos was due to the unclear laws and the lack of spirituality! All things have spirits, but they are in chaos and no one can unify them ... Fellow Daoist huntian, you want to unify the chaos so that you can establish a unified dynasty and unite the spirits, right?"Huntian nodded and said,"that's right!" I may not understand everything you said before, but now that you've said it, I've come to a realization. Your so-called spirit, in my eyes, should be intent!"Huntian explained,"all things have different wills!" Some people want chaos, some want peace. Their hearts and minds are not in one place. The chaos is United, and the will is United. Use the will of man to reverse the will of chaos and complete The Order of Chaos!"The names they used were different, but the meaning was the same.Huntian wanted to unify the chaos and integrate the spirits of all living things to complete the order of the entire chaos. This was also a method to directly complete the great Dao's spirit.As for spring and autumn, the pursuit of immortality and the passage of time without harming one's body was also a stage in the spirit devouring process.At this moment, they could see some results.Chunqiu was not as strong as huntian, because huntian was already in the process of creating a spirit, while Chunqiu was still on the path of pursuing a spirit. There were some differences between the two.The human King shook his head. It wasn't that he didn't agree, but he was too lazy to listen. He directly said,"I cultivate my body, my body has a spirit, my body has a Dao, I build my Dao spirit, I am Dao, Dao is me, spirit is also me! Li Hao, do you think I can get into the top nine?"  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao scratched his head. After thinking for a while, he said,""I'm not too sure. What the human King said seems to be right, but ...""That's good," the human King laughed."If you say there's no problem, then there shouldn't be a problem!"“……”Li Hao was speechless. Did I say that?He only had a rough impression of everyone's Dao. He was not clear about the more specific details. On the other hand, the human King was not actually asking or consulting. He just wanted to say that his Dao was not bad, so that was it. It was quite good!Since that's the case, why do you have to ask me?On the other hand, huntian Supreme Emperor ...Li Hao frowned and looked at huntian Supreme Emperor, the kind-looking Taoist. After a long time, he sighed."Fellow Daoist huntian ... You've already embarked on the path of spirit pursuit. In that case, you don't need to talk to us much. Unifying the chaos is your pursuit. Once the chaos is unified, the will will be unified. Fellow Daoist can reverse the world, the great Dao will nurture a spirit, and you will attain level nine!"Huntian's Dao had already been fixed. Or rather, he had pursued it for many years. It was impossible for him to change his Dao just for someone else's words.They were already on the road to the great Dao.He had a clear goal!Huntian had to unify the chaos.As for long Zhan ... The dispute between huntian and long Zhan might be the most serious. Yes, the most serious. The human King cultivates himself, long Zhan has to defy fate, and huntian wants to dominate ...As for spring and autumn, he could also tell that the main goal was not to fight for hegemony. The main goal was to break the shackles of time and fate, and break the limits of longevity. Therefore, spring and autumn was most interested in the art of time!However, in the face of two overlords who wanted to unify the chaos, even if you didn't want to participate, you would eventually be involved.A unified will!How could the will of these top existences not be unified?In just a few short sentences, everyone actually saw each other's goal. At this moment, long Zhan did not say a word. He and huntian were destined to fight, a battle of life and death, unless one of them died early.The two of them were destined to have a life-and-death battle with the others, or the others would submit to them.At this moment, the human King actually understood and understood everything.At this moment, he smiled and did not say much. Instead, he quickly changed the topic.""We all pursue different spirits when we enter grade-9. How did those guys manage to enter grade-9 so easily a million years ago?"Spirit!It was too difficult.He didn't believe that in these millions of years, all the people who came later were not as good as the people who came before.However, none of them had reached grade-9.Including huntian!Huntian wasn 't. If he was, he wouldn't have come here. There was no need to discuss the Dao with them.

p At this moment, huntian said in a deep voice,""Because...There is a limit to the number of spirits that can be born from chaos! The chaos is still chaotic on the whole, and those people from a million years ago seized most of the spirits. They achieved Dao, but they also cut off the path of future generations!""In other words ... Chaos, a million years ago, was actually ... Orderly!"Huntian's eyes were cold."Cutting off people's path is also a method that many worlds have no choice but to use. I don't blame them, and I don't have the right to blame them! However, these people didn't do it and left a chance for their descendants ... I don't like them!"Everyone was stunned.However, it seemed that only Li Hao and the human King were stunned. In fact, the old venerable sovereigns all seemed to understand.At this moment, Li Hao was in a trance.So that was how it was!The Dao from a million years ago might have a spirit naturally existing, or there might not have been a need to specifically sense a spirit a million years ago.That was because the chaos a million years ago might still have been orderly.It was only when a group of people reached rank nine and completely absorbed their spirituality that the life death Emperor, the calamity Emperor, and the sky Fang Emperor appeared ... This group of Dao Masters had exhausted all the spirits of the great Dao of the same element!Li Hao was lost in thought for a while before he mumbled,""In that case, the chaos was originally orderly, but these level nine venerable sovereigns turned the chaos into disorder. A million years later, we're looking for the path to order again ... Then why did they disappear?""Wait for the appearance of the time path master!" Huntian said calmly. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ "What?"Li Hao was stunned. Why did he have to wait for time?At this moment, everyone was exploring the secrets of the entire chaos. However, this was also a type of Dao seeking. They wanted to know the reason so that they could understand the great Dao better.Huntian thought for a while and shook his head."I'm not too sure. Maybe it's to solidify the Dao of order, maybe it's because the spirituality is dissipating and needs time to reverse. Maybe it's because there's a reincarnation every million years. If their descendants want to reach level nine, they need time to nurture their spirituality. Maybe many, many ... Are possible! However, I have to say that these people's disappearance might not be because they're lying in wait ... They might be waiting for an opportunity!""Besides, we can't treat them all as bad guys," he continued."I've thought about it before. Perhaps ... They're pursuing an eternal order!"At this point, he sighed with emotion,'order can only last for a short period of time? After a period of time, would it become chaotic? Did these venerable sovereigns go somewhere to explore the key to order, to solidify the order forever and not to worry about disorder? Perhaps ... That's what it is!"This was the best result.A group of level nine venerable sovereigns were exploring the path of solidification. They were not waiting for another cycle, for the next powerful being, the time King, to solidify or reverse for them!At this moment, Spring Autumn Emperor sneered,""No matter what, time...Is probably the target they've been aiming for all this time. It might not be a good thing. Haoyue, don't think that they're waiting for you to succeed. Perhaps, the day you succeed will be the day you die. Or perhaps, they simply want time to stabilize chaos, stabilize the DAOs ... Stabilize order!"At this moment, the human King's expression changed slightly. He suddenly thought of something and said in a deep voice,""In the past, my new martial world created the big cat, which is also Emperor Cang! Emperor Cang's role was to collect the rubbish in the universe and stabilize it. Hence, he had been silently nurturing the big cat ..."He looked at Li Hao and suddenly said coldly,""You ... Or war, are you the second trash can that some people want to raise? The trash can of the entire chaos, or perhaps it was not a trash can, but something else, such as a solidifying device or a Jack. How about using time to stabilize the chaos? How about I use it to solidify my Dao?"Li Hao did not say anything.At this moment, he furrowed his brows slightly. Was that so?Human King and spring and autumn, spring and autumn might be just to scare him, but human King ... Might really think so. Because, back then, it was the same for neo martial. Emperor Cang's role was actually not everyone's pet. He seemed to be a proud Son of Heaven, but in fact, he was just a trash can, collecting the garbage of the entire universe!As for neo martial, it was the era after Zhan he, and Zhan he, Emperor Cang, was very good.All of this, could it be, indicating something?Perhaps he wanted to tell everyone something?Why did Zhan commit suicide?Everyone had their doubts. Li Hao didn't say anything, but the human King said in a deep voice,""Can time ... Create order? A long-term construction?"Li Hao exhaled and said,"I think it's possible!" "The Dao of time is a bit special. Time is the only Dao .... In other words, once the ten thousand DAOs are assimilated by time, they become the only Dao of time. The Dao is the only Dao, and the sequence is stable. Naturally ... Order is formed!"“……”Everyone's expression changed slightly.Could it be that his guess was true?Huntian was also stunned. He suddenly said,""Then I'll kill you, not a tier 9! If I don't kill you, the primordial chaos won't be unified ... Will you feel sad whether I kill you or not?"Li Hao exhaled."Let's not talk about this! Let's not talk about it for now! I don't know the details, and neither do you. Everyone ... Let's continue discussing the great Dao!"He changed the topic and went straight to the point.""Our cultivation methods and methods might be different, but I think the end result will be the same! They're all establishing orderly laws, and in order, nurturing spirit is a key process ... Currently, several fellow Daoists are pursuing this process ..."

The others nodded. Of course, this didn't stop the human King from continuing his attack. He was about to surpass Li Hao.Li Hao was also helpless. The human King's desire to win ... Was frighteningly strong.At this moment, everyone was curious. This person was really persistent in slashing forward!Of course ... At the thought that tens of billions of great Dao crystals could fill many small worlds, Li Hao subconsciously walked forward. As he walked, the others quickly followed.The human King cursed in his heart and continued to slash forward!"Let's learn from each other," Li Hao said as he walked."If there's something I don't understand, I'll talk to you. If there's something you don't understand, you can also talk ..."Li Hao said first,"I've discovered something. A Dao can give birth to more than one Dao. It's chaotic. Perhaps there are too many DAOs and they need to be classified!" "This ferocious Tiger?"Li Hao nodded."Yes, but I have a question now. On the whole, will a spirit be born in the end? for example, the chaos great Dao now?"The moment these words came out, long Zhan's expression suddenly changed slightly.The others also seemed to be looking at him.Long Zhan was silent for a while. After a long time, he opened his mouth,""Maybe!"Li Hao's expression changed slightly.The chaos race was born to rely on the chaos great Dao. This ...Huntian changed the topic to those grade nine experts,""If the chaos great Dao has a Dao spirit, is this Dao spirit the key to all the chaos great DAOs? Those grade-9 cultivators ... Were they trying to capture the Dao spirit of this great Dao, or were they trying to kill it? Or something else ... Was it related to their disappearance? Where were they hiding? Could it be in the depths of the chaos great Dao? And not the so-called edge of chaos?"“……”Everyone was speechless, but they quickly thought in that direction.Li Hao's eyes flickered."Fellow Daoist long Zhan, you might know that you're trying to stop Tian Fang from returning, right?" he asked.Long Zhan said calmly,"yes.""Why?""It has nothing to do with this Dao discussion!"Long Zhan did not seem to want to answer, but the human King sneered,""You know so many great DAOs, could you be the incarnation of a Dao spirit?"Long Zhan ignored him."Could he be Dao Ling's disciple?" the human King laughed.Long Zhan still did not speak."Your wife?" the human King asked. Lover? Father and mother?"“……”Long Zhan said coldly,"human King, speak. Don't gossip. You're very bored!"The human King chuckled and slashed with his saber, surpassing Li Hao. He laughed and said,""Alright, I won't ask! Li Hao, are you nurturing the spirit and devouring the Dao?""Yes," The human King nodded."That makes sense. That's a good idea. In that case, since I'm a spirit, perhaps I should learn from the big cat and devour the Dao!"Spring Autumn was much more straightforward than them, and he quickly interjected,""Is time related to the Dao devouring?""It's hard to say, but time is ever-changing ... Initially, I did say that I could let whoever came in first get to see and interact with time ... Actually, it's not a secret. But now that everyone is here ..."Time instantly appeared in Li Hao's mind. Thousands of DAOs rotated and seemed to jump. Li Hao slowly showed them, and they quickly circulated and changed. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ At that moment, the look in the spring Autumn Emperor's eyes changed slightly, as if he wanted to touch it himself.Li Hao quickly retracted his words."Supreme Emperor of spring and autumn is not number one ... So ... There's no need to touch it for the time being. In fact, I've already explained the core theory. The Dao of time might have been devoured or combined before!"Venerable Emperor Spring Autumn was a little regretful, but he quickly said,""So you're saying that we have to nurture the spirit first?""It should be,""However, there are very few methods to accumulate spirit. For example, huntian is pursuing a great unity ... How did you manage to accumulate spirit today?""Emotions, thoughts, and one's own will. The human King should have some understanding of this."The human King nodded,"that's true!" It's actually a kind of force, the force of the heart. My heart is invincible, my force is invincible, the force becomes a God, the God becomes a spirit, the spirit contains the Dao, the Dao is stronger than me, I am stronger, the force is stronger ... This is a cycle!"He explained Li Hao's God in a few simple words.Li Hao kept nodding his head. That's right!Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn fell into deep thought and didn't ask further.People like them understood it at once, and there was no need to say more."Daoist Hao Yue," huntian suddenly said,"your time can reverse the past and the future, right?""I guess so.""Of course!" Huntian suddenly laughed."Today, everyone knows about spirit and rules. It's just that we've communicated with each other and understood our hearts better! We don't need to care too much about what those grade-9 experts want to do. We'll just deal with them when they come!""If we continue to move forward now, we might not be able to gain anything more ..."After saying that, he looked at Li Hao and said after a moment of silence,""I have a presumptuous request ...""Then I won't say it!" The human King interrupted.Huntian ignored him. 'You're just a sh * t stirrer, shut up!'"From what I can see, fellow Daoist Hao Yue wants to create his own primordial chaos. As a primordial chaos ... The problem now is perhaps the source of life ... Right?"Li Hao nodded. This wasn't a big secret.He could tell at a glance.Huntian laughed."Actually ... We're also very interested in this. Fellow Daoist, are you interested in working together to reverse heaven and earth, reverse time, and ... See the Dao from a million years ago?" That includes ... The world's origin!"Everyone was stunned. Even Li Hao was stunned.Huntian Supreme Emperor was cold and overbearing.""Let's turn back time and go back a million years. Let's take a look at the Dao back then! Looking at the world at that time, I think that it will be of great help to everyone. However, I think that we may encounter some trouble, such as ... The level 9 from back then!"

"However, if we join forces and return to the past, with our spiritual will, perhaps ... We can play with a real ninth-rank!"The moment he said that, the human King's interest was piqued.""This is good, I like it! However, I'm first this time, right?"“……”Huntian frowned slightly. This guy's competitive spirit was really a headache!"We'll give you the Dao crystal ... But it'll be used as a resource for fellow Daoist Hao Yue's time consumption, not ... You!"This time, the human King was displeased!"On what basis? I'm the furthest, aren't I? I've reached the 8800th square, what about you guys?"He was interested in seeing the world from a million years ago. However, if you lose, you have to admit it!How could he not admit it?Li Hao felt a little helpless. In fact, he was also very interested in huntian's idea. He didn't dare to do it alone, and it was very difficult to do it. He might even lose his life, but if they were together ... He had some confidence!The human King probably wanted to go as well. Yes, he definitely wanted to go.However, this person just wanted to get first place!At this moment, he had indeed walked the furthest. As he madly slashed, he used himself as his Dao and did not think that this was cheating. Therefore, his Dao was still stable, and his Dao heart was incomparably firm!However, if they continued to fight for the human King position, it would be a waste of time.Li Hao was also very interested in huntian's suggestion.Thereupon ... In the next moment, Li Hao rode the fierce tiger and charged forward at an extremely fast speed. The fierce tiger tore apart one Dao after another, while Li Hao also used the time myriad DAOs to rapidly charge forward.In the blink of an eye, he had left the human King behind.When the human King saw this, he cursed in his heart!This kid!At this moment, Li Hao was moving forward with almost no obstacles. When he reached the 8999th square, Li Hao stopped and looked at the 9000th square. "I'll be the first to arrive! There was no point in continuing to move forward! "Everyone should be able to reach this point. If we go further ... The 9000 Dao laws involve spirits. The Dao here is very fake and doesn't really have the intention of exploring the Dao ..."Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he said,""However, this place involves some other dimensions. If we reverse time here, perhaps ... We can return to Tian Fang, the Tian Fang from a million years ago! I want to meet the master of Tian Fang, and even ... Get in touch with him!"The moment these words were said, even the human King no longer thought about earning money. He rapidly moved forward and madly hacked at the sword. He was somewhat excited."You mean we should go to Tian Fang, the Tian Fang from a million years ago, and witness the Grand occasion of that year?""Right!"At this moment, the other people were also extremely fast. Regardless of whether it was huntian or long Zhan, who seemed to be the weakest, they were all very fast and quickly shuttled over.The aura of the spiritual body was slightly chaotic.However, he still managed to rush here.Anything further in the past involved spirit. Dao chess had no spirit, so Dao GE didn't have much meaning.And all five of them were able to make it this far!This was actually very terrifying. It meant that the five people's comprehension of Dao was close to or had reached level nine. The reason why they weren't level nine was because of their spirit, not Dao!p Li Hao was actually a bit surprised.But he didn't say much.At this moment, seeing that the others had not spoken, he said,""In the five elements, can the metal spirit reach here?"Huntian suddenly sneered and shook his head,"he ... Forget it!" With the five elements combined, he could barely fight against the Spring and Autumn period! Right now, it's just the two elements merging into one. By himself, even long Zhan can defeat him. He might only be slightly stronger than you and the human King, but the strength is limited ..."The human King sneered,"stronger than me?" Are you serious?"Huntian Supreme Emperor remained silent.It was hard to say if he was serious or not, but the combination of the metal and spirit elements would definitely have the power of 6000 DAOs, or even stronger. But that was it. If it was stronger than the human King, it would be limited.Spring Autumn was even more straightforward."The five elements brothers are still quite impressive when they work together. However, when they separate ... They're at the level of reincarnation at most. They're nothing!" Whoever takes the North will be the winner. Why are you saying all this?"The five elements Supreme Emperor did not come this time.However, at this moment, the fact that these people were not here made everyone feel that ... The five elements realm was not qualified to control a region.It didn't show enough deterrence!He didn't show enough potential.Hence, the two overlords seemed to have decided their fate."Daoist Hao Yue," huntian continued,"if we return to Tian Fang after this time's time reversal, it'll be extremely dangerous ... Tian Fang might be the strongest among the level 9 experts! We're just spiritual beings ... This time, I have some thoughts, I wonder if you can accept them?""Fellow Daoist, please speak!""Our spirits will fuse with you, and you will control time. You will reverse time and use your body to fight against Tian Fang! Of course, you'll be in greater danger, so you'll have to descend with your true spirit ...""Why don't I go with my main body?" the human King stroked his chin.He didn't seem to be afraid of death! He was very interested.It must be very cool to fight against the strongest!I'll fight the most powerful one!He was also curious about Tian Fang.Originally, this group of people had only come here to discuss the great Dao and the rules ... But now, they all wanted to go and take a look. They wanted to go to a million years ago and interact with the strongest people in the past, or even ... Exchange pointers!A bunch of crazy guys!In the past, if they were killed, Li Hao would have died immediately, and the others would have been severely injured.The human King didn't stop him. In fact, he was interested in fighting him!"The master of Tian Fang might not be a bad person. Perhaps ... He's very hospitable ..." Li Hao said hesitantly.Huntian Supreme Emperor just looked at him without saying anything.The human King also crossed his arms and laughed. Spring Autumn chuckled and teased,""Fellow Daoist, you're being a bit hypocritical. You've come from here, 9000 units of land, and you've gone to the heaven to peep at the Dao. You've even peeked at the Dao of the core of space. Peeking at his spirit, peeking at his core ... If he doesn't beat you up, does he want to treat you to a drink?"“……”Li Hao coughed lightly. That was true!"Tian Fang and I ...""You only owe Tian Fang and the other two a favor, not the master of Tian Fang. This time, we're just going to take a look. If he's not hospitable ... We ... Will join forces to beat him up!"Long Zhan even opened his mouth and laughed coldly,""I also want to see what Tian Fang is planning! I also want to see if the group of people at the peak of the current chaos a million years later can kill the Tian Fang from a million years ago!"“……”You're so overbearing!Li Hao pursed his lips and soon smiled."Then ... I can give it a try, but it's more dangerous for me this time. Plus, I'll be using time, which may consume a lot of my lifespan. I'll take the first one, but ... It's not enough. This time, if some of your spiritual bodies are still left ... I'll let you go and contact my clones. How about ... Giving them to me?"艹!At this moment, everyone was stunned and cursed silently. Your appetite is bigger than the human King 's!The human king only wanted the great Dao crystal. Good fellow, you beast, you're asking for such an exorbitant price without saying a word!He wanted their clones!Their clones weren't weaker than an ordinary rank eight. It was equivalent to directly taking away the energy of a rank eight.Furthermore, they were the avatars of several top-notch existences!The human King had an innocent look on his face. 'I don't have a clone. Does that mean that I'm not counted?' Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ That's good!Young man, you finally know how to respect your elders!As for the few of them, they were all filled with anticipation and ... Desire.After hesitating for a moment, huntian said,""I ... Have no objections!"Was he raising a Tiger to cause trouble?Perhaps!However, at this level, so what if he gave it?Since Li Hao was willing to take the risk, why wouldn't they be willing to part with a clone?"I don't have any objections either. I have many clones, and you can have as many as you want. Of course, this one is the strongest!" Spring Autumn chuckled.Long Zhan was somewhat helpless. He could not be considered wealthy.In the end, he still nodded his head. This trip might be beneficial for him to deal with Tian Fang, so he agreed.At this moment, Li Hao finally laughed.Comfortable!The Dao crystal is mine, and these people's avatars are willing to stay ... Very good.He could even borrow the power of these few people to go back a million years ago!"I think ... It might be very interesting.In fact, he might even be able to get in touch with the master of tianfang personally. That way, he might have a clearer understanding of the future.The group of people made a decision. They were extremely decisive and were about to start.As for the people outside, they were still waiting to see who would be first and second ... Little did they know that they had already started to turn back time silently, going back a million years ago to touch the real top big shots of the chaos.

Chapter 3564 Collision (1)
(Today's update, I took a break, my state is not as good as before, writing continuously, my head is a little dizzy)He reversed time and space, returning to a million years ago.A group of people really dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to do.Time was reversed!At this moment, the long river appeared and the five of them floated above it. At this moment, the others were all curious and looking forward to it.Flowing time! In the chaos, this Dao was the most mysterious.Even though many people mistook the Dao of spring and autumn for time, it wasn 't. The only similarity was that time could cause one to age in an instant. That was the Dao of spring and autumn, not the Dao of time.At this moment, Spring Autumn Emperor was also very curious.This is the river of time?He went against the current as if he was going back to the past.At this moment, their feelings were a little complicated. They were not friends or Daoist friends, but enemies.New martial was fighting for the position of the eastern Overlord, huntian wanted to unify the chaos, Chunqiu wanted to find a way out for the race, long Zhan wanted to go against the heavens and let the chaos become the Overlord, and Li Hao wanted to explore the myriad DAOs of chaos and create chaos himself ...They were different in nature. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao had also killed people from the warring Dragon Guild, and the warring Dragon Guild had expelled neo martial ...In short, they were not the same.But today, they had stepped into the river of time together to pursue the traces of the past. He couldn't help but sigh.At this moment, everyone was very quiet.He just watched the river flow silently.He walked on the river.Time was flowing backward.On the river, waves swept over. This was a major event in the past. Every wave represented an era, or something major was happening in this era.Ten thousand years, fifty thousand years, a hundred thousand years ...Suddenly, a huge wave came.Everyone's expression changed slightly!Li Hao's eyes flickered. He stomped his feet and suppressed the world. The waves still swept over. He seemed to see a figure flashing in the waves!The human King's expression changed slightly!A long saber appeared in his hand. He took a look at it. At this moment, his mind was spinning. For a moment, he had a complicated expression.The other people's expressions all changed slightly.A hundred thousand years ago, someone stirred the chaos and changed the color of the world?Why ... Did he not know!As chaotic overlords, they knew nothing about it.Long Zhan, on the other hand, seemed to have realized something. He didn't say anything and only glanced at Li Hao and neo martial. At this moment, he was also feeling extremely complicated.New martial!No, it was the yin-yang world. Yin and yang had created so many experts and geniuses ... Why was this world so different from the rest?Battle!Yes, it must be him.More than 100000 years ago, when the neo martial world first opened, it was the era of war. Of course, it was an era that no one knew about. Those who knew about war were perhaps ... Some of the big shots in the past.How laughable!"I'm famous, but no one in my generation knows. No one can know. No one is worthy of knowing. Only those ancient experts are qualified to know my glory.After that, he died in battle and left behind energy to help the human King.And then, Time and Stars created the Li Hao of today.And then ... Would there be more?How terrifying would it be if these people belonged to the same bloodline!The waves swept across!In this era, it seemed to have set off a monstrous wave, but everyone was very puzzled. A hundred thousand years ago, in the era of war, chaos was actually very quiet and did not cause any impact. In Zhan's entire life, his main body might not have left the neo martial world at all.How could it cause such a huge wave?They also knew that the larger the waves, the greater the events of that era. It was unbelievable that a war could cause such a huge wave in this era!Li Hao had only suppressed the waves. At this moment, he suddenly looked back and frowned, his expression changing.The others seemed to sense something as well. Behind them, far off in the distance ... It was as if waves were sweeping toward them from far, far away, from the place they had entered."Is that ... Our future?" huntian suddenly asked.'Our future ... The waves have actually swept all the way to the present and the past ... Is this to overturn the entire past?'It was a terrifying scene!There weren't many experts in this era, and it wasn't as glorious as a million years ago. Could they overturn the past?Today, all the chaos Overlords had gathered together just to meet Tian Fang. In the past, Tian Fang had been so difficult ... Had the surging waves of the future affected the present?Li Hao did not say anything.It was just a glance ... It might not be what the future would be like, it might not be a big event, maybe ... It was related to the person he saw.He ... Was he also on this River at this moment?Perhaps!……At the same time.At the end of the river.The group of people went against the current, just like Li Hao's group. The young man in the lead suddenly looked forward, and waves swept across the world!The man took a look and suddenly said,"in the past ... Something big happened as expected. Waves swept across the world. Was there a Great War in the past?" Such a wave has cut off our path, I'm afraid it'll be difficult to cross ..."What a huge wave!Were the old men and women in the past so good at causing trouble?"This wave is frighteningly huge. In comparison, the calamity of our ten thousand races seems to be less than eleven times. Is this a great era, a calamity of the great chaos?He was a little excited and smiled."The waves are rolling. It seems that the change of the past is not far away!" I seem to see countless powerhouses fall ... Blood and chaos! Interesting, very interesting!"

Chapter 3565 Collision (2)
The people behind him didn't speak. After a long time, someone laughed,""Now this is interesting, flowing time! I really want to see it! We've killed all the enemies of the ten thousand races, and we're used to licking blood from our blades. How can we sit still? it'll be interesting if we join in!""I can sense danger ..."At that moment, the young man suddenly said,"there are dangers on the river. Be careful. That person might also be on the river of time. Although it's not the same era, the river ... Is still one!"It was the same river, but it was divided into the past and the future.​ Crisis?The crowd was puzzled, but they all believed in the young man. At this moment, they were all more vigilant.The young man looked forward and raised his brows slightly. Many thoughts were running through his mind. At this moment, that person might be above the river. This was interesting. This also meant that the entire time and space might be in chaos.He was interfering with Changhe's future, and that guy might be doing something as well. If he were to interfere with the past, the past and the future would all be affected ...The young man thought. Suddenly, he looked back and fell into deep thought.The river of time ... Could it finally form a closed loop?"The other party is interfering with the past, and I am interfering with my own past. His future ... Will there be a moment of reunion?I seem to be quite interested in what he's doing.There were thousands of thoughts in his mind, but at this moment, he didn't say it out loud.Perhaps ... There would be a chance. They might not have to wait for the other party to open up the myriad world because this long river had always existed.……"Boom boom boom ..."The water of the long river was getting louder and louder.The five of them went against the current and crossed the previous wave. The following wave was very little.This also meant that ... Nothing major had happened.The human King seemed a little bored and muttered,""Nothing major happened for hundreds of thousands of years. What a bunch of idlers!"“……”The few of them remained silent.What a pity, why do you have to open your mouth?Do you have to fight every day to meet your expectations?The chaos was huge, but it had not reached that stage yet. Why would they fight and kill each other for no reason?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  However, it was actually not bad that nothing major had happened in the past hundreds of thousands of years. The waves on the river were much smaller, and it was much easier for Li Hao to turn back time.At this moment, the others were also stabilizing the river.It might be possible to use memory recall on Li Hao alone, but it would be very difficult to use a spiritual descent directly!A million years was simply too long.In front of them, there seemed to be a huge wave. Spring Autumn said,""Is the era of Tian Fang and the others in front?"At this moment, he was a little excited.The river in front of him seemed to be much clearer. Perhaps this also represented the clarity of the great Dao.Li Hao glanced at it and nodded slightly.""It should be!"……Tianfang world.In the four-sided domain.At this moment, tianfang world was still desolate. It was extremely quiet and deathly silent. The universe of the great path also appeared dark. At that moment, some of the chaos race cultivators who were guarding tianfang world suddenly raised their heads in confusion. The entire tianfang world seemed to have changed at this moment. They could vaguely hear human voices."Do you hear the sound?""It's like ... It's like ... It's like ... Someone walked past me and mumbled something in my ear ...""What's the situation?""Quickly report this!"The group of venerable sovereigns guarding the place suddenly felt their hearts palpitate. What was going on?Why did this godforsaken place suddenly seem to come alive? it was as if ... It had returned to the times of prosperity. However, there was nothing to be seen. Could it be a ghost?However, for cultivators ... There were no ghosts and monsters. They were just spiritual bodies. Could it be that a powerful expert had invaded?That's strange!Just as they were feeling puzzled, in a place they couldn't see, or in an era they couldn't see, tianfang was extremely prosperous and prosperous!In this incomparably huge world, people came and went.Countless mortals existed in this world, and countless cultivators soared in the sky.The division of heaven and earth!With space as the boundary, one heaven and One Earth.In the sky, countless cultivators were like Immortals, living in another dimension. Heaven and earth were separated, and the power of the great Dao flowed between heaven and earth like water.Laughter, curses, countless feasts, and palaces were swaying in the light.The sound of silk and bamboo, The Sound of Music, came and went without a sound."The radiant envoy has arrived!"In the distance, the incomparably prosperous Great Hall seemed to be holding a grand banquet at this moment. There were people welcoming guests and singing loudly.The radiant envoy, one of the two emissaries of heaven.Along the long Street, the sound of silk and bamboo spread. Gradually, a huge Palace appeared in front of them. There were fairies dancing and soldiers shaking their heads as they listened to the melodious singing.A Golden Age!Unparalleled!Today was the 100000th birthday of venerable Tian Fang. Countless guests came from all over the world, including many high level venerable sovereigns. There was also a group of Dao Masters who were about to arrive to congratulate venerable Tian Fang.Even for a level nine venerable sovereign, a million-thousand-year-old birthday was a rare event.For someone as strong as a Grade 9, how many times did he have a million-thousand-year birthday?In the current chaos, how many people could have a lifespan of a million years?It was bustling with activity.This was a gathering of the unrivaled.It was said that even peerless experts would come to congratulate the venerable one.……In the Grand Hall.At this moment, the place was full of guests.There were venerable sovereigns inside and outside. Seventh rank venerable sovereigns could only bow their heads and lower their brows. Only eighth rank venerable sovereigns had a place here, and the inner regions were where the main characters of the day were.An existence at the Dao master level!An existence that had comprehended the laws ... Yes, the laws. This was a term that the Dao Masters used. It had nothing to do with them and was far from them.

Chapter 3566 Collision (3)
At this moment, in the inner area.Someone was already there.It wasn't a round table. There were only Thrones here. The tables in front of them were also made of high-end weapon forging materials. They were low-key but luxurious.Above them, a person was dressed rather simply, but his aura was extremely majestic.At this moment, he looked at someone below and smiled.""Calamity, you're the fastest to arrive ..."Below, a square-faced middle-aged man smiled.""My domain is very close to your Tian Fang, so it's better to come early than late. If I didn't come earlier, there wouldn't be such benefits ..."After he finished speaking, he drank a mouthful of bejeweled nectar and shook his head with some emotion."Good stuff ... Good treasure! As expected, you, tianfang, are more than willing to harvest chaos essence ... I didn't come to my million-year birthday banquet in vain. "The cultivator above laughed,""Your lightning territory has a lot of good things, yet you still covet my dirty things?""You're wrong ..."The square-faced cultivator laughed. Just as he was about to argue, the person above suddenly frowned and looked into the distance."A million years ... It's been a million years since the chaos ... Disaster, even if you and I are ninth-rank, how many million years can we live? And now, the spirituality of the world has dissipated ..."The Lord of calamity frowned slightly."Today is a day of great joy. Why are you discussing such unhappy things?""You want to use today, when everyone is gathered, to discuss this matter?""I have such an idea.""This is bad!"Calamity shook his head."I'm in charge of calamity, but I can't punish the Dao Masters. There's no solution. No matter how strong you are, you're only the Dao master of space and not the Dao master of chaos. You can't solve it!"Tian Fang didn't say a word and was only in deep thought.Then, he looked at the sky and frowned. The Lord of calamity saw him looking at the sky a few times and was slightly puzzled."Who are you waiting for?""I don't know,""No..." Tian Fang shook his head."I ... Have some premonition. There might be an unexpected guest today!"An unexpected guest?The Tribulation was also a little suspicious. Suddenly, he thought of something, and his eyes flickered. Tian Fang also looked ahead and fell into deep thought.After a long time, the Lord of calamity spoke."To you, you are proficient in all DAOs. How can there be unexpected guests? unless ... It is not within your control. The chaos of the heavens only exists time!""Perhaps ... It is!"Tian Fang smiled, but he didn't look at her again.After drinking a cup of wine, he was in deep thought.……At the same time.The river rippled, and Li Hao's face was pale. He looked at the huge wave in front of him and took a deep breath."If we go down, it will be a million years ago! You and I are merely travelers of time. To descend into the past ... Is very dangerous! In this era, there were many grade-9 experts! "In the past, when I was traveling around neo martial, I was discovered by the human King and almost killed by a saber ..."The human King shrugged his shoulders. 'Count yourself lucky that I didn't hack you to death. I thought that you might be related to me. Otherwise ... I would have hacked you to death long ago!'"Everyone, do you want to go down?""Since we're already here, why would we back out now?" huntian said in a deep voice. To gain some experience ..."Li Hao rolled his eyes."I'm just going to take a look. You won't necessarily die. At most, you'll suffer some losses. I might even die because of this!""You're ... Not willing?"Huntian was a little surprised. You're scared now?This ... For a moment, he didn't know what to do.The human King chimed in."That's true. It's too dangerous. It's not worth it without a hundred or eighty billion great Dao crystals!"“……”Was there a need to?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The venerable sovereigns were speechless.Li Hao, on the other hand, laughed.""If we descend together, it'll be very troublesome if we split up. I have a technique that can fuse my Dao! Turn into a Dao spirit and guard my domain! Fellow Daoists, are you willing to guard the four corners of the world? Consolidate the time!""Combine into one and descend together! "At this moment, there's no time to copy and imitate. You're only spiritual bodies, so it's easy for you to fuse with my Dao and control my Dao domain. With my power and the power of the four directions, you'll definitely be able to protect yourself!""You won't descend together. Instead ... You'll fuse with my Dao, just like the others who have fused with my Dao domain and assumed command over an entire realm!The few of them were speechless!At this moment, the king of humans was speechless."So, we're ... Just supporting characters. You want to be the main character?" If you want to show yourself, do you think we have to be nameless people?"I'm so pissed!Li Hao's idea is for everyone to merge with his Dao and help him!Wasn't this ... A wage earner? 'When did I, Fang ping, ever work for anyone?'"Can the inner world of the human King accommodate us?" Li Hao asked with a smile."Sure!" The human King nodded.“……”Li Hao was at a loss for words. He quickly said,"can you merge Dao into one?""Alright!"“……”Li Hao was speechless."Then ... Can I control time and escape at the critical moment?" he asked.“……”Alright, the human King shrugged his shoulders. This would not do.Good boy, where's the general!"Alright!"At this moment, huntian was also helpless. He didn't want to do anything at first, but this guy was even more ambitious. Clearly, he wanted them to control the Dao world and the great Dao, not just simply control it, but also ... Integrate.At this moment, a small world appeared in front of Li Hao.He smiled brightly."Seniors, please choose a realm for yourself. It's best if it's a small realm that can fully display its combat power!"Spring Autumn didn't even say a word. He instantly merged into one of the little realms. That little realm was originally very weak and was just created not long ago. It was just a small void realm.Suddenly ... The little realm expanded!The great Dao in the realm instantly grew from the size of a bean sprout. In just an instant, it withered and bloomed, as if it had undergone a transformation. It swelled, madly swelled, and endlessly swelled. This was something Li Hao had never experienced before.

Chapter 3567 Collision (3)
The Dao of the withering of time!In an instant, the little realm reached level three, level five, Level Seven ...In the next moment, the little world trembled and expanded crazily. In just a moment, a rank eight world ... Actually took shape!Even Li Hao was a little shocked!It was just a spiritual body, but it actually fused into it and directly pushed a small world to level eight. This was ... Terrifying!Spring Autumn chuckled,""I'm the Lord of the South!"Seeing this, huntian Supreme Emperor shook his head slightly. Li Hao was slightly surprised that he had stepped into a realm. It was ... The Art of War!A militarist!The moment he stepped in, the little realm suddenly spun like a chessboard. The world shook and a murderous aura overflowed. The entire little realm also expanded wildly. In an instant, it turned into a big realm and fell to the East."My Lord is the East!"A militarist!Li Hao's heart trembled. This ... Was huntian his major or minor?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  For the time being, he could not see through huntian.He could see through the others, but he still couldn't see through the other party completely.At this moment, the human King saw this and wanted to run towards the east. Long Zhan saw this and smiled. He shook his head and did not fight with him. He headed straight towards the North and instantly merged into a world.That realm was like white jade, suddenly expanding infinitely.This was simple, the realm of the physical body, or the realm of strength!A giant dragon spiralled around the boundary and madly extended.It had actually ... Also become a grade 8 realm.As for the human King, it would only be interesting if he merged into One World. Countless human Kings appeared, as if countless great DAOs were the human King himself. Even the core Dao of the small world, Li Hao's Phantom, was instantly twisted into the human King himself!"My Lord is the East, and my realm is my cultivation!"The human King laughed heartily. The realm had even transformed into the appearance of a human King ... It was extremely flashy.Li Hao was helpless!He was really ... Young.At times, one would really envy the human King. He was so full of energy that it seemed a little abnormal. Now that he was a thousand years old, he didn't know if he would still be so full of energy after a few more years.Long Zhan was quiet and did not say much either.Although the four experts didn't know much about Li Hao's Dao, they had a tacit understanding. In an instant, the Four Realms surrounded Time and Stars and began to affect other realms.The worlds were instantly combined by them!Li Hao's eyes flickered. In the North, hundreds of small realms transformed into a giant dragon. In the South, a cold cicada seemed to be transforming, crawling in the long river.In the East, the projection of the human King expanded. Hundreds of small realms merged and turned into small balls. In the West, huntian had formed a set of tactics with hundreds of small realms. It was like an Army of thousands of horses and soldiers conquering all directions. Not only that, but the four of them also used time as the core. At this moment, in the center of time, a fierce tiger was roaring in the forest!It was Li Hao's Dao spirit.Although this was the first time the four of them had merged, they were all very proactive. Unlike the Silver Moon Martial Master, they directly combined their boundaries and formed a party with their own characteristics!And these worlds were faintly connected.Originally, Li Hao had opened 3000 realms, but only 2000 were filled. Now, each of them had 500, but when combined, they gave Li Hao the feeling that they were extremely powerful. Each realm seemed to be twice as powerful under their combination!Li Hao even felt that he might be ... Even stronger than when he killed Samsara.It was unbelievable!Countless comprehensions emerged in his mind. Today, the four of them had merged their DAOs into his, which was a huge improvement for Li Hao. Countless great Dao comprehensions spread to Li Hao along their spiritual bodies.The spring Autumn Emperor laughed."Good plan, Daoist Hao Yue. We're not afraid. We're only afraid of ... Long Zhan. After this, we'll have to be careful!"Long Zhan's face was calm. At this moment, he had turned into a giant dragon, his eyes as deep as the sea.Today, among the four great experts, realm fusion Li Hao and Dao fusion Li Hao, Li Hao's harvest was bound to be huge.He had a grudge against Li Hao.This was like raising a Tiger!But ... Compared to entering the world a million years ago, even if that was the case, he would still accept it.At this moment, Li Hao felt that he was extremely powerful and fearless!Whoever comes, I can kill them with one sword!He instantly smiled, and the boundary disappeared as if it was surrounding him. His smile was brilliant."Then I'll ... Go down!""Hurry up!"The human King urged, but he was still unhappy. Today, this fellow had once again stolen all the limelight.'It's just Shi Guang, I'm too lazy to learn. Who doesn't know how to do it?'Li Hao didn't say anything more. He jumped into the waves and began to fall.However, during this process, they were dazzled. In the void, there seemed to be incomparably huge great Dao. It was a net of great Dao, and the huge great Dao seemed to be alive!……At this moment.Tian Fang, who was still holding his birthday banquet, suddenly looked up at the sky. The powerful existences who had just arrived in the tianfang realm also looked up at the sky.The entire world, the entire chaos, seemed to be torn apart by something at this moment.The huge paths seemed to be ... Afraid of that direction.After a while, the grade 8 experts seemed to have noticed that the light and dark messengers had appeared in the hall. The light Messenger shouted,""Where is the expert, the one who came is a guest, why hide? You've disturbed my Dao master's million-thousand-year birthday banquet!"The light and dark messengers attacked at the same time. At this moment, the light and darkness merged and the sky changed color. It was as if two giant Dragons had merged. The two messengers did not hold back. The guests today had all come openly.

Chapter 3568 Collision (Part 5)
This was the only place where heaven and earth suddenly rippled, as if they were being torn apart. This ... Was a provocation!The two tier 8 powerhouses joined forces. At this moment, light and darkness merged together and they were extremely powerful!The powerful power of great DAOs instantly fused together. The light and darkness of heaven and earth changed, and the chaos changed colors. The two emissaries were not weak among rank eights. At this moment, as they joined forces, they exploded with extremely powerful strength.Heaven and earth were like the fish of yin and yang, trying to completely crush the river that had suddenly appeared!At this moment, the heavens and earth trembled. A hand appeared from the endless void. With a flick of a finger, time withered, light and darkness were extinguished, and the heavens and earth were destroyed.All the powerful existences in the palace changed their faces!This ...The combined attack of the eighth-grade light and darkness messengers had been destroyed in the blink of an eye!Several emissaries floated in the air and shouted. The five elements combined into one. Five power fluctuations instantly fused and a huge sword flew into the air. Five elements emissaries!In the next moment, the life and death messengers roared and appeared to fight the enemy.One figure after another appeared.In front of the hall, a sleeping dragon suddenly roared. Behind him were a large number of Dragons with powerful physical bodies. Instantly, ten thousand Dragons rose into the air and suppressed the world!The Coiling Dragon envoy!At the back of the hall, the master of Tian Fang only watched and did not interfere.The Lord of calamity's eyes moved slightly, but he didn't say anything.Outside, the Dao Masters who had arrived or had not arrived all looked at the sky with suspicion and surprise in their eyes. They did not say anything, and no one made a move.This is ... The existence of a special spacetime?Was it?It definitely was!This ... Was Shi Guang!A traveler of time?Perhaps it was!Between heaven and earth, there was only a Jade-white palm. When it reached out, the time withered and the life and death messengers were directly destroyed. The two messengers coughed out blood.The next moment, he clenched his fist and punched in the direction of the Coiling Dragon envoy. With a loud boom, the Coiling Dragon envoy fell, followed by countless Dragons behind him!The Coiling Dragon envoy's face was filled with shock. This was ... A Dragon!A Dragon?Where did this powerful Dragon come from?In the next moment, a blade appeared between heaven and earth. Using his hand as a blade, he slashed down and the five elements were shattered. The five elements emissaries all coughed up blood and fell to the ground. They were all extremely shocked.Tian Fang was very strong!Life and death, light and darkness were all level eight venerable sovereigns, the five elements messengers were Level Seven venerable sovereigns, and the water spirit Messenger was also Level Seven ... Yes, the land of Taoist connotation that Li Hao had encountered in the past was only level six.The Coiling Dragon emissary and the others were all Level Seven venerable sovereigns.A large group of advanced venerable sovereigns!Moreover, because they came from tianfang, they were all incomparably powerful with the addition of tianfang's great Dao universe. They were much more powerful than Level Seven and level eight cultivators from ordinary worlds. Other than level nine cultivators, any level eight cultivator would have to bleed if they came here!However, today ... It was instantly defeated by unknown guest!"The Dao of physical strength, the Dao of the sword, the Dao of the blade, the Dao of withering and glory ..." At this moment, Tian Fang murmured softly as he looked up at the sky with a look of doubt in his eyes.Was this ... Another way of using time?Or could it be ... That this person was skilled in all DAOs and had cultivated all of them to the perfection of martial arts?In the primal Chaos void, a long river flowed. That arm started to become clearer. Gradually, it was as if a person had walked out of the long river. It was somewhat illusory. At this moment, both parties saw each other!Li Hao looked at the man in the distance and then at the man beside him.The Lord of calamity?The master of Tian Fang!He finally saw her!He looked around. Was this the Tian Fang from a million years ago?It was incomparably prosperous and prosperous!It was like a Fairyland.At this moment, as tianfang's experts were defeated, the Lord of the calamity suddenly laughed coldly,""What a guest from beyond the heavens! Coming uninvited and disrupting the chaos, such power, why don't you let me try!"As soon as he finished speaking, countless Thunderbolts appeared and turned into a giant!The lightning giant!It floated in the air and was extremely powerful.At this moment, Li Hao extended his finger, and a piece of divine text appeared. It was the text of calamity. The moment the divine text appeared, the countless Thunder Giants in the Sky suddenly trembled. The next moment, some of them collapsed! "What?""You ..." The Lord of calamity was shocked.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The Dao of tribulation!This person controls my path of calamity?Soon, countless Giants recovered as if they had spirits. The great Dao shook as if it was going to shatter the divine text of calamity!The chaos lightning tribulation filled the sky and was about to shatter Li Hao!At this moment, a ray of light flashed on Li Hao's body. The next moment, yin and yang reversed, and countless Thunderbolts were instantly turned into Yin Thunder."What a good fellow!"The Lord of calamity also took a deep breath. Yin and yang reversal ... This was also possible?What was going on?However, he didn't use his full strength at this moment. In the next moment, the heavenly Tribulation lightning turned into a giant with a roar, shaking the world. Even Li Hao's River was shaking from the powerful pressure!At this moment, Li Hao was also mentally exhausted.It seemed like ... He had come to the wrong place.He didn't expect that there wasn't only one tier 9 here. The Lord of calamity was here, and there seemed to be more tier 9 experts around!He had really entered a Wolf's Den!If it was just one grade-9, that would be fine, but if there was more than one ... That would be a real headache.However, at that moment, he could still see and sense many things. This world, this world of the past ... Was full of spirituality!The lightning tribulation also seemed to have come alive.

Chapter 3569 Collision (1)_6
It was completely different from the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.This lightning giant would even take the initiative to avoid the killer move.As expected, his guess was right. The great Dao of the past was more spiritual.Not only that, Li Hao could see even more at this moment. He saw countless great DAOs filling and spreading in the void. He saw that these great DAOs had not formed a Dao domain!The Dao domain did not seem to exist.Or perhaps, it was a path taken by the later generations.He also saw that this world was full of life ... As if it came from the heavens, chaos was everywhere, and life was everywhere.He also saw ... The sun and the moon!The sun and moon of chaos!It was unbelievable that there was a sun and a moon in the chaos. The sun seemed to light up the chaos, but the chaos was dark now. Someone had cultivated the Dao of the chaotic sun and moon?And then, he achieved tier 9 and took away the great Dao?So ... Chaos had fallen into darkness?At this moment, countless Thunder Giants were charging at him, but Li Hao didn't make a sound. Talking through space and time was the most energy-consuming thing!A long saber appeared, and the surrounding heaven and earth seemed to have turned into an inner world.It covered the entire area!Countless human Kings appeared, wielding their sabers as they charged out. One human King corresponded to one bolt of lightning. In the next moment, a tremendous force pressed down on them. The roar of a Dragon came from the mouths of the human Kings, shaking the heavens and earth. The lightning tribulation was shattered!At the same time, countless human Kings were in formation. All of a sudden, a majestic force as if an Emperor had descended with overwhelming might and unified the chaos!The will of the heavens was united!The chirping of cicadas resounded through the chaos, and the lightning tribulation Giants suddenly collapsed as time passed!"This ..." n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  "What!"At this moment, countless people were shocked.Tribulation path master's great Dao had been broken.Who was this person?Where did it come from?As for Tian Fang, he let out a sigh of relief. The Lord of calamity's expression was slightly ugly, but he snorted,""So that's how it is, there's more than one person!"Not just one!At this moment, he finally realized that it wasn't just one person who was fighting him. It was many experts who had crossed time and space."Is this the only way?"The Lord of calamity snorted!"If that's all there is to it ... Then it's nothing more than this!"In an instant, tens of thousands of Giants appeared. Each of them was extremely powerful. It was as if what had happened earlier was just an appetizer. The others continued to watch the battle as if they were trying to make a judgment.Li Hao ... Was also slightly shocked!The five of them had worked together to break through the lightning tribulation giant. They had thought that they had severely injured the level 9 giant, but it turned out that they had overestimated themselves!Although the five of them had joined forces, they were not all at the peak. They were only spiritual bodies.Of course, the rank-9 here could also be seen as a spiritual body.However ... The other party was just an appetizer.The appearance of these tens of thousands of Giants ... This was the power of a Grade 9!Li Hao didn't say anything. It was actually very interesting to fight with these top existences. It was also what he had been dreaming of!The next moment, a long sword appeared!It was as if time had stopped!The sword slashed out with boundless power, and the years withered and withered. Rumble ...Countless Giants were crushed!The Lord of calamity's expression changed again! So strong!Stop time?"Five!" Tian Fang suddenly said.The Lord of calamity nodded. He understood. This time, five people had joined forces, not one. There were five experts from the past or the future who had descended here!This was still alright.However ... From the looks of it, none of them should be ninth-rank.This was already very terrifying. He wasn't a tier 9, but he was actually able to fight against a tier 9 like him.In front of this group of juniors, he had lost some face.At this moment, the master of the Tribulation took it seriously. With a low roar, Thunder rumbled through the world. The Thunder was just a manifestation of the Tribulation. The next moment, it was as if the void had collapsed and countless disasters had appeared!The flood, the flames, the chaos, the collapse of the world ...This was the true calamity!The lightning was just an external display. Among the grade-9 experts, he was the Lord of calamity and wasn't weak. How could he be defeated so easily by a few grade-8 experts?In the void, the DAOs seemed to be full of spirituality.Not only that ... At this moment, even the chaos great Dao seemed to appear. These tier 9 experts seemed to be ... Directly extracting energy from the chaos great Dao instead of the world.The Dao of chaos!They seemed to have fused with the chaos great Dao.Li Hao's expression changed!Tier 9, fused with the chaos great Dao?So that was how it was!He had discovered some other amazing things.By his ears, long Zhan's voice rang out,""Fusing with the Dao of chaos ... Extracting the chaotic force. No wonder they can maintain a combat strength of the ninth rank.
