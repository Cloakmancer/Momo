p At that time, it would depend on how his daughter operated. If she did it well, the path to the Grand unification of the ninth rank would be completed.Feng Yan listened attentively. In fact, she didn't care about this, and she didn't want to help the human race hypocritically ... In her eyes, in the eyes of the chaos, the human race was just food, the enemy!However, since her father had said so, she would listen to him. It was because she worshipped the Dragon Lord too much."I understand!"She wasn't stupid. The Phoenix had taught her well. It was just that she was too young and didn't have the experience of leading an area.At this moment, he memorized the Dragon Lord's words in his heart."When the four-sided region has settled down, tianfang might not recover so quickly ... I'll go out for a while!" The Dragon Master said.He looked in the direction of the outer region and said after a long time,""Take Hong Yue with you and secretly kill some experts to disrupt the situation in the entire outer chaotic domain. Pretend to be a subordinate of huntian or someone else ... Pretend to be a human and slaughter some human experts!"Feng Yan was instantly a little worried.Wouldn't it be too dangerous? Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "In this period of time, you, Black Tiger, Qing Qiu, and the others will work together to control the dragon world and the four-sided region. To the outside world, just say that I'm in seclusion to break through to the ninth-grade!" The Dragon Master smiled."The black Tiger will cooperate with you to suppress and exploit the human race. You ... Will have to tame a group of humans during this period.""I got it!"Feng Yan nodded.The Dragon Lord didn't say anything more and instantly disappeared.'Hong Yue isn't very honest ... I'll take him out this time to let him understand that there's no other way but to cooperate with me.'As for Red moon's strength, which was not too strong among the eighth step ... That was fine.To subdue the Crimson Moon, the strength of a rank eight was one point. The second point was that the Crimson Moon world and the neo martial world were born in the same region. Neo martial artists had always been within the Crimson Moon region, and so was Silver Moon.The new martial arts had just emerged, and there were so many seventh-rank worlds in the red moon region. The red moon sovereign did not fight them, but instead, he fought the new martial arts ... Was there any connection between them?Was it because the human King was too overbearing?However, at that time, the human King was still walking around in the nearby area and did not provoke Red Moon at all. As for the sun god's wandering, why would he keep an eye on a seventh-level demon when he did not cause any damage to Red Moon?Was all of this related to the time cultivator who was born in new martial arts?He wasn't talking about Li Hao, but ... The time cultivator of the previous generation, the one he had seen in Tian Fang, the one who had discussed the Dao with the master of Tian Fang.The Dragon Master did not have any evidence, and the red moon sovereign did not seem to have such thoughts. They had only encountered new martial at random and had a conflict ... Now, their old nest had been raided.But ... Red Moon Emperor, an eighth-grade cultivator who cultivated the path of desire, was often devoured by his own desire ... This was not normal.Perhaps it was not the red moon Emperor's problem. Perhaps ... It was the influence of some other unknown existence?It was easy to lose control of one's desire. However, he had cultivated to the eighth step!At this point, he had lost control many times. He was either afraid, angry, or crazy ...All of this was not normal.The Dragon Master did not discover anything. He only felt that perhaps it was more valuable to keep Hong Yue.Furthermore, this guy was the first person to go against the new martial artist Silver Moon. The new martial artist did not kill him, Silver Moon did not kill him, Chi Yang and cloudy sky died, but he did not die. Was this considered unparalleled luck?All of this, perhaps ... He would have to wait and see.……At this moment, Li Hao was wandering in the chaos.The nine Heavens and earth.In fact, the division was quite obvious, but for Li Hao, there were almost no barriers. He could go wherever he wanted. Interestingly, the cultivators from the outer realms were very obedient. Even if there was no one around, they would not wander around.Maybe he was afraid of death, or maybe he was used to it, so he went to the floor he was supposed to go to, but he didn't see anyone crossing.Is this considered a rule?Then, who was the one who established the rules of the nine Heavens?According to Kang Han ... He did not know. In any case, since he was born, the chaos had been this rule. It had been this rule all the way until now. All the worlds were acting according to this rule.There didn't seem to be any punishment for violating it. It was just that the weak didn't want to walk on the same level as the strong, so this rule continued.But at this moment, Li Hao had some thoughts.Was this ... Also the Dao of a ninth grade venerable sovereign?This seemed to be a kind of order, a Dao that established order. However, from the looks of it, there was nothing special about it. It just turned the entire outer region into Nine Heavens and earth.There wasn't even a clear punishment, nor any special signs ... Apart from the large amounts of chaotic energy in the various layers of the world, there didn't seem to be anything special.Unlike the lightning territory, which had countless Primal Chaos lightning tribulations, it was obvious that the person who established it had very powerful means!Was he overthinking it, or was this really a ninth-grade Dao?It was just that he didn't understand. The other party didn't make it obvious, but hid it very deeply?He passed through another layer of heaven and earth and entered the so-called seventh heaven. Li Hao sensed that it was no different from any other place except for the denser chaotic force.When he reached the seventh heaven, he only had one feeling. This place was completely devoid of people.There were almost no cultivators left, not even wandering cultivators.

Li Hao silently sensed it for a long time before exhaling.""If this is a type of Dao, what kind of Dao would it be? I can't feel it at all. Apart from the classification of the worlds, there's nothing special about it ... If it wasn't for Dao, who would spend so much effort to divide the entire chaos into Nine Heavens and earth?"The chaos was huge.What's the point of putting in so much effort?Moreover, with so many worlds, the ones that came later should have been moved up by themselves, but at the beginning ... If no one was controlling it, who would move their own world away?Kang Han was at a loss.The others, on the other hand, were used to it.Kong Ji knew what Li Hao meant. Li Hao had mentioned that level 8 to level 9 might involve order. At this moment, he thought for a moment and said,""There doesn't seem to be anything special about it. Could it be that the chaos was once unified in the past for the convenience of management? I'll build a tower-shaped world and manage each level. I'll be at the top of the nine Heavens and have less trouble ..."Li Hao was deep in thought. It was possible! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "Man-made transformation of chaos into the nine Heavens," Wu Shan said."It makes the chaotic and chaotic universe slightly clearer. It clearly knows where the small worlds, medium worlds, and great worlds are distributed ... Does this count as a process of sorting out the disorder? Perhaps, the person who did it back then cared more about the process than the result ... As for whether the nine Heavens is useful or not, the other party didn't care?"Li Hao nodded again. This made sense!"The current world might not be the same as the previous world ..." Dao Qi said."Will it be the same as the master of tianfang? in fact, the inner world of the nine Heavens back then was actually ... A kind of Dao order?"Li Hao was dazed for a moment, but then he nodded again. It made sense.Using the true myriad of worlds as one Dao to create a Dao domain?This ... He had actually never thought about it, but there was still a possibility. One had to know that he was actually establishing a Dao domain of the world. He dared to think and do, so why ... Did the ancient people not dare?Li Hao took a deep breath and thought, that makes sense!Whether it was Kong Ji, Wu Shan, or Dao chess ... None of them were ignorant or incompetent. They all put forward their own ideas, and they all seemed to make sense.Second cat looked at them and was speechless.The Queen and the Black Panther were just looking at each other like dogs ... It didn't matter if they didn't understand.Kang Han was even more confused. What are you guys talking about?Li Hao's eyes flickered as he said,"I think the theory of Dao chess is very likely ... But the chaos is so vast that it's not easy to see the whole picture ... If someone really turned billions of worlds into a Dao domain, there might be a treasure in the nine Heavens that can observe the chaos universe!",m “……”Kang Han was stunned. This time, he understood and found it unbelievable. He said, slightly at a loss,""The nine Heavens ... Actually, there's not much difference. There are some macro worlds. For example, the world of Samsara seems to have run to the nine Heavens. There are also the world of chaos, the world of five elements, and the world of spring and autumn. These Overlord forces are all in the nine Heavens ..."There was nothing special about it.According to what you said, there are still treasures?What a joke!I'm an old man from the Outlands, and I don't even know. You guys, who just came out, just said a bunch of nonsense and you determined that there was a treasure in the nine Heavens. What nonsense are you saying?Bullshit!Unfortunately, he did not dare to say it out loud.Forget it, it's up to you.However, don't run around. If you go to the nine Heavens and meet the strong ones from the Overlord worlds, you'll be in trouble.Li Hao, on the other hand, touched his chin, looked up, and then looked around. He mumbled,""I'm so lucky. There are indeed many opportunities in the outer region. I seemed to have sensed a level nine Dao as soon as I left ..."Although he had yet to discover anything, if he could really find the treasure he guessed he would find, perhaps he could see how a grade-9 cultivator established his own Dao domain with a realm as a reference.At this moment, Li Hao thought of something and suddenly frowned.Could it have been taken away?Looking into the distance, he fell into deep thought. If someone took it away ... It could only be huntian. After all, the other party seemed to be building a unified chaos. Could it be that he wanted to recreate the path of a level nine venerable sovereign?With this in mind, Li Hao led his team to the eighth level. The Twin universes were nearby.

Chapter 3372 Advancing Side By Side (1)
Twin universes. In a powerful world within the primal Chaos, the two brothers had both reached level eight and had many Level Seven subordinates. The Twin universes were one level stronger than the level eight worlds in the four-sided domain.However ... Not long ago, Supreme Emperor Tian Yang had fallen, and two other seventh rank Supreme emperors had also died.Today, in the Twin universes, Supreme Emperor di yang was very low-key.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The turmoil in the four-sided region had caused the Twin universes to suffer a great loss. They had originally entered the four-sided region in order to seize tianfang universe and vainly attempt to reach level nine. Even if they didn't reach level nine, the twin brothers would be able to dominate a region once they reached the peak of level eight. The East still lacked an absolute Overlord.Unfortunately ... All of this had now become a dream.What was more troublesome now was that chaos had also begun to stir.After huntian Supreme Emperor reached level nine, he began his path of unification. The spring and autumn in the south and the five elements in the North were all expanding. In the East, the Samsara Emperor was powerful. Besides the Samsara world, there were several level-eight universes that were not weak either. The Twin universes were originally one of them.Today, it had fallen to the bottom of grade 8.It wasn't purely at the bottom, but compared to before, it was still a bit worse. With one less eighth-rank, there was less competition.Now, it might be a little difficult to protect himself.Some powerful worlds in the East had also begun to expand. Even now, the news of Tian Yang's death had not been confirmed, although there were rumors circulating. Once it was confirmed, the Twin universes might face a crisis.Supreme Emperor di yang was still thinking.Thinking about the future of the Twin universes.Chaos was in turmoil. Huntian's breakthrough had broken the tacit understanding between the overlords. As for him ... What should he do next?He was unwilling to give up on the tianfang universe in the four-sided domain.However, his brother was dead. On Tian Fang's side, neo martial was strong, and Dragon Master was strong ... It was impossible for him to fight against those people alone, unless ...He then thought about how huntian Supreme Emperor had tried to rope him in.The rank seven venerable sovereign firmament had met him a few days ago and wanted to rope him in ... Could he use the power of Chaos to enter the four-sided domain again and seize the tianfang universe?Even though this was like asking a Tiger for its skin ... It was still better than now.He was a little frustrated as he thought about this.As for the recent rumors that were circulating, he didn't pay much attention to them. When he left, the lightning Master was only at the seventh rank, and it was said that he was being suppressed by the Dragon field.Even the three regions had not heard of its name.So what if he came out? what did it have to do with him?It was only a seventh-tier world. Even if the Twin universes had suffered heavy losses, it was not something a seventh-tier world could provoke. Furthermore, he had no enmity with the other party, so there was no reason for him to be involved.Thoughts kept appearing in his mind.At this moment, a graceful woman walked in from outside the hall and said softly,""Sovereign, sovereign Xiaochen requests an audience.""What?"Di yang raised his eyebrows slightly. Xiao Chen was here again? This guy was the representative of the chaos heaven realm. Although many people knew about him, they didn't dare to act rashly. Although some people wanted to kill him in the dark, this guy was quite powerful, so he had been active all this time.Meeting him in public wasn't a good thing. After all, this place wasn't the territory of chaos heaven world."Tell him to wait outside the realm!" He said after a moment of silence.He didn't allow the other party to enter this world.If he entered, he might be able to see through the situation and see that his elder brother had fallen. That was not a good thing."Yes, sir."The woman retreated.Supreme Emperor di yang sat on the spot and pondered carefully. After weighing the pros and cons, he finally flickered and disappeared from the spot.……Outside of the twins.Emperor Xiaochen had a Sage-like demeanor and appeared somewhat carefree.After waiting for a while, he was not in a hurry.He only told her to wait and not leave ... This was a good sign.There were 16 level 8 worlds in the Eastern Region, which was even more than the other three regions. The reason for this was that there was no absolute Overlord in this region, so a portion of them had even come from the other three regions.Among them, the Twin universes could be ranked in the top five, with two level eights and eight level Sevens. Such power was extremely formidable.But ... It was hard to say now.Xiao Chen thought to himself as he looked at the world in front of him. He looked at the experts guarding the realm gate. There was actually a tier 7 expert guarding it ... Under normal circumstances, a tier 8 world like this would not be afraid of an invasion at all.Not to mention seventh-rank, even sixth-rank was not needed.Now, it was a little more obvious to try to hide.Was he worried that someone might accidentally enter the realm and find out something?It seemed that Supreme Emperor Tian Yang was really dead.It was a good thing!If he had not died, he would not have needed to come here. If he had not died, these powerful rank eight worlds would not give him any face at all. However, even if Supreme Emperor Tian Yang had died, this was still a world that had given birth to two rank eight Supreme emperors.It was possible that another rank eight venerable sovereign could be born. Such a world still had great potential.After a while, Supreme Emperor di yang appeared. He frowned slightly and said indifferently,""Fellow Daoist firmament, it's a rare guest to visit our twin realms ... The realm is simple and crude, so it's not very convenient to receive you ...""It's fine, it's fine!"The firmament dust sovereign smiled."Senior di yang, please don't misunderstand. I'm here because I've obtained some information that might be related to you. That's why ... I'm here to report."

Chapter 3373 Advancing Side By Side (2)
"Oh?"Di Yang's face was calm, but he was confused. What information?Xiao Chen laughed."It's from the square region. I can't be sure if it's true or not. It's said that neo martial, light, Silver Moon, and Thunder World were all defeated in the square region. The Dragon Lord of the chaos race unified the square region!""As for the chaos beasts, the black Tiger Supreme Emperor has entered level eight, the red moon Supreme Emperor has joined the Dragon Lord, and Chi Yang, Yun Xiao, and an unknown level eight Supreme Emperor were killed by the Dragon Lord ... Oh, Chi Yang seems to have died at the hands of the neo martial human King.""As of now, the dragon clan has temporarily unified the square region ... Neo martial and radiance have left the square region and seem to have entered the outer region. There has been news that the Thunder World and silver Moon have also entered the outer region. It is said that ... The lightning Lord may have advanced to level eight. The news I have received is that Silver Moon and neo martial are one family, and both come from the same world ..."He revealed all the information he had obtained. This was some public information in the square domain.However ... After he came out, he didn't obtain any more information about the square region. At this moment, his expression changed for a moment before quickly recovering.His elder brother had indeed died.He had long confirmed this point. It was just that he didn't know who killed him before. Now that he knew, he was killed by the Dragon Lord.As for new martial's group, they had retreated from the square region. Before this, he had fought with the experts from new martial, so there was some enmity between them. Now, the Dragon Lord of the square region had a blood feud with him!Silvermoon and Thunder World were on the same side, and silver Moon and new martial were also one family. In other words ... It was equivalent to him becoming enemies with all the level eights that still existed in the four-sided domain!Yes, they were enemies.His expression was a little unsightly.He knew that the light Thearch's son was in Silver Moon. New martial and light had joined forces to withdraw, Red Moon had turned to the Dragon Master, and Wushan was also on the side of new martial ...After some calculations, not only did his brother die on this trip to the four-sided domain, but all the rank eights in the four-sided domain were his enemies!After saying all that, Emperor firmament observed the situation. At that moment, a smile appeared in his heart.It was almost done.If there was no threat, even if a rank eight died, di yang might not be willing to side with anyone, but ... Now that neo martial arts had emerged, it was said that neo martial arts had advanced to the rank eight world, and there seemed to be two rank eight venerable sovereigns.There was also the light Emperor and the Thunderbolt master from the Silver Moon ...Are you afraid of the threat of multiple eighth-rank powerhouses?Afraid that this was not enough, he said softly,""By the way, I heard that in the East, the reincarnation realm and the extreme Ice realm have been stirring. It seems that the other realms have taken in many worlds ... The East is about to fall into chaos."After sighing for a while, he seemed to be worried about the turbulence in front of him.Supreme Emperor di Yang's eyes were cold as he looked at him.If huntian had not initiated the war, how many years would the chaos have been quiet?It's all because of you! But ... Even the reincarnation realm couldn't sit still?That was normal.After all, today, the general trend was coming, and no one could remain indifferent.However, if there was chaos here, he would be in trouble. As one of the top rank eight worlds, it would inevitably attract many covetous eyes. It was normal to either subdue or destroy it.If it was before, he wouldn't be afraid of anything. He and his brother were in this realm. Even if there were four level eight venerable sovereigns in the reincarnation realm, so what?He was not afraid of the other three, except for the reincarnation Emperor, who was a little stronger.Unless the other party didn't care about anything else, they wouldn't dare to attack.But now ...The thought appeared once more. Looking at the other party, he suddenly stopped being vague and directly said,""It's not impossible for me to join the chaos heaven cosmos ... However, I'm in the East, while chaos heaven is in the West. It's extremely far away, and it's still very early for chaos heaven cosmos to attack here! During this period, I might have some trouble ...""Unless ... I can enter the four regions and seize tianfang universe. If I can reach level nine or peak level eight, I can stay here and work with huntian Supreme Emperor ...""This ..." Xiao Chen frowned.He had a big appetite.However, it would be very difficult."As of now, the Dragon race has taken over the four regions. They have two level eight venerable sovereigns and dozens of Level Seven ..." He said.This was not a simple matter.In order to take over a grade 8 world, did they have to send a Grade 9 realm personally?If they were far away from their homeland and surrounded by rank eights, even huntian Supreme Emperor would be in danger.Di yang frowned slightly,'there are many human forces in the four-sided zone. Are they willing to be ruled by a group of animals? As long as someone resists, the other experts will definitely respond ..."Xiao Chen laughed dryly. Would you believe these words?It was hard to say."It's said that the Dragon Lord is very powerful ..."Xiao Chen continued."That's none of my business!"Thearch di yang said in a deep voice. I'm too far away from huntian realm. If you want me to be the vanguard for huntian realm ... Do you think that's possible?" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Emperor firmament hesitated for a moment.However, he let out a breath and said,"it's very difficult ... It's not easy to take down the four-sided domain at the moment. However ... We can help you to solve some small problems first, such as Thunder World and silver Moon ... If neo martial also comes out ... Neo martial isn't weak, but since they were forced to leave by the Dragon Master, we have the home advantage here. It's not impossible to solve them ..."

Chapter 3374 Advancing Side By Side (3)
He looked at the other party."It's said that senior di yang had a battle with neo martial in chiyang. It's said that neo martial will take revenge for the smallest grievance. After leaving Sifang region, they will definitely not let go of this hatred!"It was time for Supreme Emperor di yang to think. Was it worth it to help him solve the hidden dangers of neo martial in exchange for him joining huntian?Was neo martial hard to deal with?It was quite difficult!He thought for a moment and said,'if neo martial artists step into tier eight, there will be at least two tier eights, and the Supreme martial artist of neo martial arts ... He's not weak, he's quite powerful! In addition to Wu Shan and that Thunder Emperor you mentioned, if they reach level eight ... They'll be extremely difficult to deal with!"Xiao Chen laughed."This is our territory, after all. As long as senior is willing ... It's impossible for the vast East to not be able to deal with some people trapped in the four-sided region."This place was more powerful than the square domain and had more advantages. At least here, he could use the great Dao universe. If it was convenient, he could even bring a world. It was not like the square domain, where he could only go there without anything.Supreme Emperor di yang fell into deep thought. After a long time, he nodded."I can consider it ... But ..."As he was speaking, he looked into the distance and frowned slightly as if he had sensed something.When Emperor Xiaochen saw this, he looked in that direction as well. However, he didn't see anything and was slightly puzzled. What's wrong?Supreme Emperor di yang only looked at it for a while. After a long time, he shifted his gaze and looked slightly puzzled. He didn't say anything. Was there an expert passing by?That was normal.However ... He was a little uneasy.……At the same time.In the distance.A group of people gathered.Li Hao and the others quickly retreated. They were surprised that Thearch earth yang was in the outer realm and they had almost run into him.They had seen the world and wanted to come closer to take a look. If the jade pendant in their arms had not flickered in advance, they would have almost entered the other party's perception range. From this, it could be seen that the other party's perception range was very large."Hu!"Li Hao exhaled."He seems to be talking to someone in the outer realm."What a coincidence.Apotheosis Wushan was also embarrassed. As an eighth rank, he had only realized that the other party was in the outer realm when they were about to meet. If they had met at the last minute, the other party would have recognized him.At this moment, that Imperial Paragon Kang Han stuck his head out and looked into the distance. He was a little worried and a little scared ... Of course, he could not help but be a little curious.A level 8 world ... He would never dare to approach it so easily in his life.And now, he was following this group of people, and this group of people was so close to him ... They were really bold.He didn't see clearly just now and was quickly dragged away. At this moment, he didn't know what was going on and was just a little confused."Who is it that can make a rank eight venerable sovereign come out to meet him? Is it also at the eighth rank?"He was only curious about the other party's identity. Li Hao, on the other hand, was slightly moved.That was true.A level eight venerable sovereign talking to a level Seven venerable sovereign in the outer realm ... This was interesting.Otherwise, it wasn't as if there weren't any Level 7s in the Twin universes.There was no need for a grade 8 expert to personally come out to welcome them. "It's only at the seventh rank ..."Just as Li Hao finished speaking, Kang Han was stunned.""Seventh-rank?"Which tier 7 would have such a big face?Very quickly, he had some guesses. He said carefully,""Could it be ... That they were sent by the overlords? Otherwise, the Twin universes wouldn't have to give so much face to even a seventh level venerable sovereign in the world of reincarnation, right?"Li Hao didn't know much about the situation in the outer area, so he was slightly moved.Was it sent by the Overlord?The overlords that Kang Han was referring to were naturally huntian, Spring Autumn, and the others.It was possible.The Twin universes had hooked up with them?That would be a little troublesome. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 At this moment, monarch Wushan was a little nervous."Should we make a move now?"“……”Li Hao was speechless. He shook his head."Don't even think about fighting. They have a level 8 fighter, and there are many Level 7s in the country, and another level 7 ... They fight so easily. Senior, why are you so warlike now?"“……”Wu Shan was speechless.Li Hao touched his chin and smiled."There's no hurry. Since we're meeting in outer space, it means that this Level 7 won't stay for long and will leave soon. Let's follow this Level 7 and see ... Perhaps we'll gain something. An expert from a dominant force? I'm a little curious now. "Everyone nodded and understood. They would kill the overlord first.Am I right?We understand!The others even began to think that killing the tier 7 expert and then impersonating him would suit Li Hao's personality.Impersonating the other party and then directly breaking through the Twin universes?In that case ... Not bad.All of a sudden, the few of them had even thought of a plan. Impersonate!This wasn't the first time they'd done something like this, so they had some experience. As for which side the Overlord was, what did it have to do with them?Since they were connected to the Twin universes, they were all enemies.If he had no enemies, he would create his own.The chaos was so big, so why would he be afraid of not having enemies?Li Hao didn't think too much about it. At this moment, he hadn't made up his mind to fight the twins. Even if he did conquer the Twin universes, it wouldn't be of much help to him.Among the venerable sovereigns around him, none of them were at Level Seven and could reach level eight.Er Mao, Sen LAN, and Kong Ji couldn't do it. They had only reached Level Seven, so it wouldn't be that fast. Even an eighth-tier great cosmos would need time.As for Dao chess ... He could make do with it, and it could also be used in seventh-tier universes.As for himself, what he lacked now wasn't energy ... Well, actually, he did.

Anyway, let's just follow and see.The group of them waited where they were. In the distance, the seventh rank venerable sovereign discussed with Supreme Emperor di yang for a while before leaving.Seeing this, Li Hao and his men quickly followed.……At that moment, Emperor firmament was in a good mood.Finally, there was a lead!The Twin universes weren't weak. He had made a huge contribution by being able to rope in a great cosmos for the chaos heaven universe. However, the other party had conditions ... Of course, this was normal. It would be terrifying if there were no conditions.As for the four-sided domain, the chaos heaven realm was also interested in it. Of course, it was still too far for them to reach."If I can take down the twins ... I'll finally have a stronger force to take root in the East ..." He thought.The only troublesome thing was that, according to Supreme Emperor di yang, he had to show his sincerity ... This sincerity was naturally new martial.Xiao Chen knew about neo martial.It was said that it was not weak, but rather powerful ... However, that was only in the square region. After all, the square region was only a small place. No matter how powerful it was, it was only a level Seven world. It was not a big deal to have just entered level eight.Firmament wasn't too afraid of him.It would be easier than dealing with the dragon Lord.Dragon Master and huntian Supreme Emperor both knew about this expert from the chaos race. It was said that they had met him once a few years ago. He was not weak at all, but it was a long time ago. He might be even stronger now.The other party had killed experts like Yunxiao and Tianyang, so it could be seen that his strength was extremely strong. He also had several tier eights and many tier Sevens under his command ... Fighting the dragon Lord was, of course, not as simple as dealing with the neo martial artists.Just as he was thinking about this, he suddenly looked behind him.He didn't sense anything, but he felt like ... Someone was following him?As he was thinking, he suddenly sensed something. A moment later, a sixth rank venerable sovereign appeared and quickly chased after him. He frowned slightly.There was no aura of a macro world. Did the venerable sovereigns come up?He was quite bold.This was the level eight region.Without the aura of a type 8 world, anyone who dared to run around here might be killed if they encountered an expert from a large world.Since it was only at the sixth step, he didn't really care.In the outer area, a Tier 6 was not considered a top-tier powerhouse. It was possible to rope him in, but there was no need for him, a tier 7, to do so. Besides, not everyone was worth it.He chose to ignore it.Li Hao, who was chasing after them, was not slow. Seeing that the other party was still on his way, he hurriedly shouted,""Senior!"“……”Xiao Chen was stunned.He's really bold!He stopped walking, no longer as gentle as before, only cold and arrogant. He looked at Li Hao, who was rushing over from the distance, and made a quick judgment.  It was still alright.An expert from a medium-level world?I didn't sense any special aura of the great Dao universe ... Why are you calling me?Of course, he was not afraid.Li Hao quickly arrived, panting. He smiled and said,""Senior, I just passed by the Twin universes ... A friend of mine said that you might be from an Overlord force ..."  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  “……”"What's the matter?"Thearch Xiaochen asked coldly."It's like this. I would like to ask if senior is representing a major power to rope in the Twin universes?"“……”Even Xiao Chen was stunned. This person ... Who would ask such a question?His expression gradually turned cold, and he frowned, somewhat indifferently.""Is this something you should be asking? Who are you, and where are you from? Why did you come to the eighth heaven?"Li Hao explained,"senior, don't misunderstand. I have no other intentions. I just want to confirm the situation. If they really represent the Overlord forces to rope in the Twin universes, I want to ask ... Do we have a chance to join them?" Or perhaps senior can recommend us to join the Twin universes. The chaos is not very peaceful, and we also want to seek a way out ..."Was it for this?Xiao Chen was speechless!However, a peak Tier 6 martial artist had come to him on his own initiative ... He frowned slightly and said,""I'm just passing by ...""No, senior, I do have a chance of reaching the seventh step!""I can already condense my Dao domain!" Li Hao immediately said.With that, he waved his hand and a Dao domain appeared, enveloping the surroundings. Xiaochen was stunned. This ... How could he meet a cultivator who was about to enter Level Seven so casually on a trip?This was really ... She was speechless.No wonder he was so bold!A Tier 6 being able to condense a Dao domain meant that this fellow really had the hope of advancing to tier 7. He might even bring the entire world to tier 7 and become a great world. A great world, even if it was only at tier 7 and had just been born, would still represent the status of a top-notch expert.No wonder!He sensed the Dao domain that was enveloping him. Yes, that's right. It seemed to be ... Mainly darkness or deathly stillness?It was a pretty good Dao domain.From the looks of it, it had not been condensed for a day or two.At this moment, his expression eased a little and he smiled.""That's right. Congratulations, fellow Daoist. It seems like ... Another level Seven venerable sovereign will soon appear in the chaos!"This time, his attitude was different from before. He smiled and said,""Fellow Daoist, please keep your Dao domain. I am chaos heaven universe Xiao Chen! It's just as you've thought ... Of course, there are some specific details that can't be revealed at the moment. If you really want to join us, you can come with me ..."Since you're here, don't leave.Let's move together first.Just as he was considering summoning more people, a free pseudo-rank-7 came. It would be good to be a fighter.

Chapter 3376 Advancing Side By Side (3)
Li Hao laughed, chaos heaven universe? Even the Western Overlord, the power of a level nine venerable sovereign ... That's right, to be able to make the Twin universes submit, level eight is a bit lacking, level nine ... Is more likely!""Senior, will the chaos heaven realm send its experts to the Twin universes?" Li Hao asked in a hurry.“……”Xiao Chen frowned slightly and looked around, but he didn't find anything. Otherwise, he would have suspected that this guy was here to find trouble.Is this how you treat a Grade 7?He felt like he was looking for trouble!Fortunately, there was no one else around, and this place wasn't too far from the Twin universes, so he wasn't too worried about enemies. Furthermore, the powerhouses of the Eastern Region weren't prepared to become enemies with huntian.He frowned slightly."I'll naturally consider it later ... This is not something you should be concerned about. If you're willing to join, come with me this time and make some contributions. Perhaps I, huntian, will help you reach Level Seven as soon as possible and become a true Level Seven venerable sovereign ..."Li Hao sighed.It looked like he was really going to take in the twins.How troublesome!"If I take them in, dealing with Gemini is the same as dealing with huntian. I've only been in the outer area for a few days, and now ... I've offended the most powerful force in the outer area again?"As expected, there are people targeting me everywhere!"It seems like huntian and the twins have reached an agreement ..."Xiao Chen already felt that something was amiss. At this moment, he only wanted to leave first. Was this fellow crazy?As for killing the other party, it didn't seem necessary. This guy even said that he wanted to join huntian.Just as he was thinking, the Dao domain around him suddenly expanded and instantly appeared, completely enveloping him."How audacious!"Xiao Chen was furious. He was not a weakling, but a true-blue seventh-rank, and he was not considered weak even among seventh-rank powerhouses. This fake seventh-rank actually dared to take the initiative to attack him?There were twin universes in the vicinity, and if the commotion was slightly bigger, Earth Sun would definitely be able to sense it.Is this person crazy or am I seeing things?In the next second ... The thousandworld appeared, and some people walked out of it. Xiao Chen's face changed. What?Level eight?There were also ... Many Grade 7 experts!In an instant, Wu Shan made his move, covering the sky and earth. Kong Ji punched out, and six divine fists, mixed with the world of Nirvana, once again enveloped the surroundings. Er Mao yawned and swallowed. Countless great Dao power flowed out of Xiao Chen's body.The chess piece instantly disappeared into the void. In the blink of an eye, the power of thousands of great DAOs appeared and bound it.As for Li Hao, he didn't draw his sword. He only lightly punched out, as if he had the power to destroy the world. In an instant, he sent his opponent into the void with a boom, and his opponent's body almost collapsed."The lightning Lord?"Xiao Chen was shocked. Lightning?Could it be the Thunderbolt master?,m But something was wrong!At this moment, he was filled with despair. Who was it? In order to deal with him, they actually sent an eighth-rank and many seventh-rank Masters. When did he have such a big face?In the next moment, time seemed to have stopped.The world seemed to freeze.Li Hao took action. Instantly, divine runes covered the essence of sleep in his body like a Dao domain, completely suppressing it. Li Hao judged for a moment and asked doubtfully,""Aren't you huntian's venerable sovereign?"Why ... Did he feel that his world force wasn't too strong?Xiao Chen's expression changed drastically. He was a huntian venerable sovereign, but ... He was a little nervous and solemn at the moment."Since you've already made your move, don't you know? I'm a venerable sovereign of the chaos heavens universe, but I'm also the realm Lord of the firmament realm in the Eastern Region ..."“……”Li Hao was speechless. After all this, she was a guide?I thought it was a local venerable sovereign!"Oh, no wonder you're so weak ... No, the power of the great Dao universe is so weak. I was worried that killing you would cause chaos heaven universe to shake ..."Li Hao was helpless. It seemed that he had been overthinking.Otherwise, there was no need to make it so complicated to deal with him.He captured him alive because he was worried that if he killed him, huntian Supreme Emperor would sense it. What if he ... Really came here?Although the possibility was not high, a level-nine universe had a limited coverage area, and it was unlikely that it could cover this area directly from the West. Otherwise, what would the other venerable sovereigns do?At that moment, Imperial venerable Kang Han was trembling with fear.At this moment, he recognized Xiao Chen. A rank 7 master was already an extremely important figure in his eyes. However ... In the hands of this group of people, he had actually been captured alive in an instant!It was to capture him alive, not kill him!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  This was much harder than killing.In a battle between powerhouses, it was possible to kill the opponent if their strength was equal, but it was difficult to capture the opponent alive.Now, Emperor Xiao Chen had been captured alive!Li Hao, on the other hand, knew that the other party was not a venerable sovereign from chaos heaven universe, so he was not so afraid. He smiled and said,""What did you talk about with the guy from the Twin universes?""Who are you?"Xiao Chen looked around, his expression somewhat grave.One level 8, many Level 7 ...This ... This person is at the sixth step.His heart stirred. The next moment, he seemed to realize something. Could it be ... From the four-sided domain?This man ... Was the Silver Moon King?Then this ... Isn't the Thunderbolt master? that ... That's Wushan?Yes, Wu Shan!The one who used the fist was the son of the light Supreme Emperor, the Ming Hall Supreme Emperor?At this moment, he seemed to have realized something. If a human King had appeared, he would have recognized him at a glance, even if he had never seen him before. However, Silver Moon King Li Hao was much more low-key. Even though many people knew Li Hao's name, very few people had seen him. Even if they had seen him before, if they met the low-key Li Hao, no one would remember that he was the Silver Moon King unless they had people around.

3377 Chapter 547
Not good!His eyes flickered. He was still discussing the conditions of taking them down and joining as the twins.Whoever knew that he would coincidentally meet her.And he was captured alive by the other party!He thought quickly and said in a low voice,""Are you from the spring and autumn world or the five-element world? You captured me alive for information on the chaos heaven realm? I'm just an emissary from the East, and I've never been in huntian, so I don't know much ..."Li Hao didn't bother to ask any more questions. At this moment, a star appeared in his hand. It was the time star.He smiled and played with it for a while. Then, he looked at Wu Shan and the others."Lock him in place and suppress him. I'll see for myself!"The few of them were a little moved and nodded.At that moment, Emperor Xiaochen still had no idea what this meant. In the next moment, his vision blurred and he seemed to be pulled into a large river. He was still a little dazed ... Then, he suddenly stepped into the river.The next moment, it was as if time had reversed. In the next second, he turned pale with shock, as if he had seen something ... Sure enough, in just a moment, he suddenly returned to the past, as if he had turned into a floating consciousness.At this moment, he was talking to Supreme Emperor di yang."It's not too difficult to annihilate neo martial ... If senior Earth Sun is willing, I will gather people to find out the whereabouts of neo martial and annihilate neo martial, Silver Moon, light, and Thunder World as a gift for senior's joining mixed heaven ..."At that moment, Emperor firmament's consciousness trembled in fear.What was this?Could it be ... Could it be the Art of Spring and autumn?He was wrong. The other party was not the Silver Moon King Li Hao, but the spring Autumn Emperor?'That's not possible ...'In an instant, he suddenly emerged from the river, and in the next instant, he returned to reality. On the other side, Li Hao gasped for breath. He had been too lazy to ask, as the other party might not have told him even if he had.Through the memory tracing technique, he brought the other party on a trip through the river of memories.At this moment, Li Hao slightly frowned and looked at him.""Is there a need? We've only been in the outer region for a few days, and we haven't offended anyone ... Although we've just attacked you and already treat you as an enemy ... It's really inappropriate for you to have designs on us in advance!"Thearch firmament's heart trembled. He had seen it too!He saw it!This person ... Seemed to really be the Silver Moon King.Time, yes, time backtrack!It definitely was!This person actually knew the art of time. No wonder he had risen to power not long ago. It was said that he was very young, but he had already caused a murder case in the Dragon field.As for Li Hao, he looked at the others and shrugged.""How unlucky! This guy represents huntian and is working with the twins on the condition that you kill me, the human King and the others ... Oh, and that includes all of you!" Wu Shan laughed, and Kong Ji also laughed."You see, I told you, no matter where we go, we're enemies! You didn't want to believe me, but now you do, right? In the eyes of outsiders, we're just a bunch of shrimp soldiers and crab generals. How can we compare to the Twin universes? In order to win him over, killing us as a gift ... It's very worth it!"“……”Li Hao was also speechless.He looked at Xiao Chen and smiled,"you're just a tier 7, but you're quite boastful!" I've always been kind and don't usually kill people. You see, I've been very happy working with Imperial venerable Kang Han. After I'm done with my business, I'll let him go home ...""You're good. I was planning to capture you first and find out more about the situation. I'll let you go when I'm fine. How can I let you go with what you're doing?""Misunderstanding, it's all a misunderstanding. I was just saying it casually. That's not what I meant!" Thearch Xiaochen was shocked. I'm the representative of the chaos heaven world in the East. If something happens to me, it might trigger the descent of the chaos heaven Supreme Emperor ...""You ... You've really overestimated yourself!"Li Hao chuckled. How could that be possible?If he really came casually, would he need you to rope him in?Who are you trying to scare!"Alright, let's not talk about this. Let's go to your old home and take a look ... Let's go. Take him to the firmament world!"Li Hao didn't say anything more and went to the firmament world first. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  As for this guy ... He would kill him first, but not now. If he killed him, the fluctuations in the firmament world would be too great, and everyone would know. He had to make some arrangements first before taking action.Since you're prepared to kill me, then I won't be polite.Li Hao muttered in his heart ... I'm a good man. Look, I'm forced to do this. I'm not a human King. Only human Kings are cruel. I'm still very gentle.He looked back at the Twin universes and smiled.From the looks of it, the outer region was the same.If you want to kill us, then I won't be polite.Also, the human King and the others had indeed come out. It seemed that the Dragon Lord had unified the square region. Li Hao frowned slightly. Since he had unified the square region ... He shouldn't be massacring humans on a large scale in the short term.The Dragon Lord would probably not care about this either.However ... With the chaos beasts in power, the humans in the square region were probably not having a good time.He wasn't being hypocritical, but he felt that ... He still had to bear some responsibility for this matter.If he hadn't attacked ... Well, if he hadn 't, perhaps this time, it would have been even worse. With the addition of 11 seventh level venerable sovereigns, perhaps the Dragon Master could directly suppress the world. He wouldn't have to take the initiative to send away new martial.Many thoughts appeared in his mind. He looked at the Twin universes behind him again and had some thoughts. At this moment, the commotion caused by dealing with the Twin universes was too big. How should he hide it?It was very troublesome!I'm new here, so I want to keep a low profile for a few days. I really hope that the human King can find someone to fight now and divert his attention!

3378 Chapter 547
Unfortunately, the human King had just come out, and there was a high probability that he had not found anyone, nor did he have any enemies. Who could he find to fight?What a headache!……And at this moment.The human King had also figured out the strength of the world of reincarnation. Four level eight venerable sovereigns were very strong!However ... He wasn't afraid. There was a high chance that the reincarnation Emperor wasn't as powerful as the Dragon Master. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  That was what he thought.If all of them were stronger than the Dragon Lord, then there would be too many experts in this Primal Chaos.At this moment, he laughed and looked at iron eater beside him."Metal Eater, you're tired. Don't talk nonsense. Go take a walk around Samsara and we'll start fishing! The blade in my hand is already thirsting for blood ..."The iron eater Emperor was speechless!At this moment, he was very worried that he would be tricked to death by this unreliable fellow.He felt a little helpless."Four rank eights ... Four! There are more than ten rank 7s, more than ten!"Did you hear that?Is this how you fish?You're trying to kill me!If you have this strength, then go fight the dragon Lord!You can't even beat the three rank eights on the Dragon Lord's side, not to mention Guangming and the others. Now, you're alone and you want to deal with Samsara? The human King seemed to know what he was thinking and chuckled,""It's not the same. Between class 8 and class 8, it's different! You don't know how strong a cultivator who has comprehended more than 6000 Dao is. On top of that, he's a beast of primordial chaos with a powerful body. He's more difficult to deal with than the reincarnation Emperor, even though I've never seen him before ...""Human King, are you saying that long Zhan is stronger than Samsara?" the iron eater Emperor's expression changed."Isn't that obvious?"The human King chuckled,"definitely!" I don't believe that any random grade 8 cultivator in the chaos is a cultivator with 7000 Dao laws. If that's the case, I'll just wash up and go to sleep. I can't live anymore!"The iron-eating man didn't feel it clearly. He only knew that the Dragon Lord was very powerful. However, according to the human King, he was terrifyingly powerful.Was that even possible?He did not understand, but at this moment, he could only brace himself and say,""Then, if all the experts in the reincarnation realm come out ...""Do you think you have that much face?" The iron eater Thearch thought about it and was a little dejected.A peak level Seven without a macro world was quite difficult to deal with, but it was unlikely that all level eights would come out. There was a high probability that there would only be one level eight. Bringing two level Seven was already giving face."I'm not sure ... If he still remembers me ..."He took a deep breath."I definitely remember!"The human King laughed,"according to what you said, you almost killed him with a rod. How can you not remember?" "If it were me, I'd have taken revenge on you long ago. Now that the enemy has appeared at my doorstep, and he might have entered the eighth rank, how could I not take revenge on you? All right, go. Good luck, I'll be waiting for your good news!"The human King laughed."After this, I'll help you break through to level eight. Once you've broken through to level eight, you can go and fight the dragon Lord yourself. That'll be even more satisfying!"“……”Although the iron eater sovereign didn't believe him, he was still a little tempted.Would the human King ... Help him enter the eighth step?Maybe ... He would?He gritted his teeth and nodded,"alright, I'll go!" But ... Human King, please take good care of iron Harrier ..."He was talking about another type 7 iron-eater, who looked like he would never return. He gritted his teeth and said,""It's fine if I die, but the iron-eating race still needs to leave behind an inheritance ..."He said.The human King shrugged his shoulders and chuckled."Don't worry. Besides, if you die, iron Harrier might die with you. So, you won't die!""Why don't we change the name of iron Harrier? I have a brother, and I always like to call him iron Harrier ..."The iron-eating Thearch was speechless. Was this the time to talk about this?Besides, we only have similar meanings, but it doesn't mean that we have the same name. The languages of different races are different. It's just a translation of the meaning transmitted by the spiritual will. This person ... Is really speechless.As for the human King, he was a little excited.He was going to do something big!After so many years, he could finally do it without fear.He then turned to look behind him, feeling a little suspicious ... Was Silver Moon still behind them?You're actually slower than me?What was Silver Moon doing?Forget it, I don't care anymore. After this, I'll run away first.As for the iron eater Emperor, he had a heavy expression on his face. He was not afraid of death as he headed straight for the reincarnation realm. If he died, so be it. Although it didn't feel very reliable to follow a human King ... When it came to tricking a human King, it was still quite tempting and exciting.Dry!

Chapter 3379 Four Pack Wolves (1)
The world of reincarnation.An eighth level venerable sovereign, who was cultivating with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes. Something seemed to have appeared in his eyes.He was still a little confused ... But his expression changed in an instant.In the blink of an eye, he broke through the air and disappeared.In an instant, he travelled through the void and arrived near the realm gate. Looking into the distance, a huge iron-eating beast carrying a huge iron stick was roaring angrily,""Bastard, I'm just passing by. Why can't I walk here ..."Outside the realm gate, a rank seven venerable sovereign from the reincarnation realm shouted,""This is the nine Heavens! You're so bold. Which world are you from? how dare you roam the nine Heavens ..."The iron eater Thearch looked as if he was about to fly into a rage. Suddenly, he looked at the realm gate. The next moment, he seemed to be a little confused and hesitant. "It's ... It's you, you bastard?""This is your world?""You're looking for a beating!"While the grade 7 expert was still in a daze, a metal cudgel smashed down.The power of a peak tier 7 instantly erupted, and a cudgel broke the firmament!BOOM!With a loud bang, the seventh rank venerable sovereign was sent flying backward, coughing up blood. He could not believe that someone dared to attack a seventh rank venerable sovereign of the world of reincarnation in the ninth heaven!This was crazy!Was the other party crazy?In the next moment, the giant panda's eyes turned red as it shrieked,""Eighth-ranked? Bastard! You're not fit to be a tier 8 ... Just you wait, I'll kill you sooner or later!"As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and fled into the void at an extremely fast speed.At this moment, the man near the realm gate seemed to come to his senses and realize that he was right. It was really him!Iron-eating! Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ His eyes were filled with killing intent.The past instantly appeared before his eyes.Many, many years ago, when he was young, he had traveled to all directions, crossed the Thunder region, and went to the square region. One day, he encountered a group of demon race. As for why they had a conflict and why they had fought, he had almost forgotten.He only remembered that ... On that day, he had killed two demons. However, in the end, this detestable fellow smashed him into the abyss with his club. His bones were broken and he was almost beaten to death by his opponent's Club.That day, long Zhan appeared and stopped the other party from killing him ...It was also after that time that he worked hard to rise and finally stepped into rank eight, becoming the fourth rank eight venerable sovereign in the world of reincarnation.He had almost forgotten about the iron eater ... Or rather, he had never forgotten the humiliation he had brought him that day. However, the situation of the four-sided region was unclear. The world of Samsara was also constantly on the punitive expedition to fight for the position of the eastern Overlord. He was very busy and couldn't care about the four-sided region.But today ... He actually saw the person he hated the most and wanted to kill the most in front of his house.BOOM!The sound of the explosion woke him up. The moment he saw his enemy, he lost his composure.It had been a long time since he had lost his composure.At this moment, he took a step forward and headed straight for hun Dun. Behind him, several venerable sovereigns appeared in an instant. One of them hurriedly shouted,""Fu Sheng, where are you going?"Venerable sovereign fleeting life was the fourth rank eight venerable sovereign in the world of Samsara. At the same time, he also had a great background. He was the descendant of the Samsara Emperor ... Although many generations had passed, he was the most talented and had the most promising future among his descendants.When he was very young, he grew up in front of the reincarnation sovereign. He had been learning the Dao with him and successfully became a seventh rank venerable sovereign. He had thought that the eighth rank would be extremely difficult, but he did not expect to smoothly enter the eighth rank after a period of training.The key to becoming the world of Samsara and dominating the eastern chaos was that the three level 8s might not be able to become the overlords of the East.However, with four rank eights and one more rank eight venerable sovereign, the effect was completely different. It surpassed the extreme Ice world, which had three rank eight venerable sovereigns, and reincarnation had four!Recently, the world of Samsara had been discussing how to deal with the other rank eight worlds. It was a very important matter. At this moment, several rank eight venerable sovereigns had gathered in the world of Samsara. They suddenly felt that venerable Emperor fleeting life was losing control ... And all of them became anxious.Before this, they didn't pay much attention to the conflicts in the outer realm. After all, it happened quite often, although it was rare to see experts being attacked.But now, Fu Sheng had rushed out directly ... This was very troublesome, because it was likely to be a trap.Venerable monarch fleeting life's voice reverberated with a hint of coldness. "I'm still sober. This is iron-eating, the four corners region's iron-eating!" The two rank eight venerable sovereigns immediately knew who it was.It had been so many years!It was also at that time that Fu Sheng entered level eight. It was said that when Fu Sheng returned, he was in a miserable state. Even the Samsara Emperor almost sent him into Samsara. Fortunately, he was saved in the end.Enemies meeting!The two grade 8s were enlightened, but they still advised,""Don't chase now. We know a little about iron eater. He had a conflict with long Zhan in square region and his world was broken. He escaped from square region ..."They had just received the news.The problem was that there might be more than one person on the iron-eating Emperor's side. There might be more than one expert from the four-sided region who had escaped this time.And they just happened to meet outside the world of Samsara?They were worried that there would be some trouble.Let's wait and see!"I must kill him. No matter what, I must kill him! If it wasn't for the lightning territory stopping me, I would have already gone to take revenge. If I don't kill him, my thoughts won't go smoothly ... I know that the two uncles are worried that we will be lured away and that there will be trouble ... Just me going alone will be enough!"
