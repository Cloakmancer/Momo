s not bad!""Young people should be more independent!" Yu Xiao laughed.Li Hao smiled and nodded."You're right, Sir. That's why I'll be more independent. In the past, I was taken care of by my teacher in the Silver City. Everything was decided by my teacher. I've never considered being independent ..."So he was still an obedient baby!No wonder!At this moment, Yu Xiao finally understood why this kid was so naïve.Yuan Shuo, Oh Yuan Shuo, you're the one who wasted your disciple.A giant baby!This was the legendary mommy's boy, right?No, this was a Shi Bao man? "Is your teacher very good to you?"Li Hao hurriedly nodded and said,"very good!" Teacher treated me like his own son, and he was able to enter the corral spirit stage ..."At this point, Li Hao paused for a moment, but still said in a low voice,""It's also related to me. Teacher has said many times that we must not leak this information ... Sir ... Sir, please don't tell anyone. Otherwise, if teacher finds out, he'll definitely be furious!"Yu Xiao's eyes moved. So that was the case!I was wondering why Yuan Shuo was able to rise again when he was injured so badly that I thought he was crippled. So this is the reason.It's a pity that this disciple of yours has been spoiled by you. He actually took the initiative to say it.Li Hao recalled the past and said sadly,""When my teacher was here, he was very good to me. Other than practicing martial arts, he would listen to me in everything. I would study and practice martial arts. After three years, my teacher has been better to me than my biological parents. It's all because of that hateful Hong Yue...I hope that when hou bu recovers from his injuries, he can kill them all!"Li Hao gritted his teeth in hatred.Yu Xiao seemed to have recalled something,"that's right, your teacher is so good to you, why did he allow you to join the inspection Office?.""Teacher said that it's safer to join the inspection Office," Li Hao said innocently."There are more people above to take care of me ...""So, your teacher found out about Hong Yue's murder?""Yes, yes!"Li Hao nodded and said embarrassedly,"my teacher said that in order to make the inspector think more highly of me, I had to report it. I ... I ... I'm too embarrassed to say it. But it's okay. My teacher isn't here right now."At this moment, Yu Xiao laughed.He thought for a while, and his smile softened."Alright, I got it. Li Hao, work hard. If you do well, I'll take you to the central continent. When you get there, you'll know how high the sky is and see more of the world. ""By the way, you've broken through 100 perfection, right?"Li Hao nodded his head, somewhat proud,"yes, I killed sun moxiian!" At that time, I would have advanced! My Lord, I'm very powerful. Hao bu said that I can even fight against some early stage sunlit supers. In Silver Moon, my strength has actually reached its peak, and there aren't many sunlit ..."Yu Xiao laughed. Yes, he was very powerful.The early stage of the sunlit realm ... Impressive!This guy really told me everything he knew. He answered everything I asked. I'm almost falling in love with him.What a pity ... What a pity!Sometimes, treasuring a treasure could lead to a crime.Your blood is too precious."That's all for today. Remember, other than me, if anyone else comes looking for you, including those from the headquarters, don't reveal anything. I'm thinking about your safety. Not everyone is like me, understand?""Understood!" Li Hao nodded."Then you should go back first ... Go back and rest early after work tonight. Young man, don't be too tired.""Thank you for your concern, Sir!"Li Hao was very happy and excited."Go!""Milord, then I'll take my leave first!"Li Hao left happily.As for Yu Xiao, he sat in the private room and drank a cup of tea. Suddenly, a smile appeared on his face.The origin divine weapon, Li Hao ...He drank his tea and fell into his imagination.That feeling, maybe ... Maybe if I drink all his blood, I can break the fifth superpower lock. It's very possible!Sunguang?In addition, there was an origin god weapon ... His eyes flickered. This might be his greatest opportunity to surpass Hu Qingfeng ... No, Hu Qingfeng was nothing. The few monsters in the central region were his real targets!He had to complete it before hou Xiaochen came out of seclusion!As for the secret of the eight great families and the scheme of the Crimson Moon, what does it have to do with me?This was just right ... Perhaps, he could disguise himself as one of the Crimson Moon's men.He had no reason to deal with Li Hao, but Red Moon ... Had her reasons!Who would believe that I killed Li Hao?It was impossible!Only Hong Yue would deliberately take away Li Hao's body, because everyone knew that Hong Yue had paid a great price for the eight great families "Affairs, and would even take away his body."A perfect target ..."He laughed. After killing someone, Red Moon was the best target to shirk responsibility to!No one would doubt him!……At this moment, Li Hao, who had just walked out of the teahouse, returned to the Nightwalker headquarters.Hao lianchuan glanced at him, and Li Hao nodded with a smile.Hao lianchuan was a little surprised and said,""Will he make a move?"Li Hao nodded again.He would!And you're still not at ease?Don't worry, not only will they come, they might come faster than you think. They might even pretend to be Red Moon ... This way, no one will feel that it's inappropriate to kill them."Hao bu," he said in a low voice,"you must be ruthless and kill him with one shot. Otherwise, I won't do this next time!"Hao lianchuan also nodded. He was surprised. Was she really that sure?He felt that those guys at the headquarters still had some self-control.He wouldn't attack Li Hao so easily. After all, they hadn't fallen out yet.He was only trying ... But Li Hao looked so certain. What did he say?Could he fool a middle stage three yang from the central region to the point where he had to kill him?He then thought of something and transmitted a message,""It won't attract the others, right?"That Xuguang better not come.Li Hao shook his head. How was that possible?How could he simply tell others about a treasure?Hao lianchuan was even more surprised. He took a closer look at Li Hao. Really?'This kid, even I don't believe him.'"Tomorrow night!"Li Hao added. He would go back to draw the map tonight and come back with Hao lianchuan tomorrow morning. Only tomorrow night would be a suitable opportunity. Moreover, the other party couldn't wait too long. Minister hou's exit was a reason to force him to act quickly.Hao lianchuan's face was blank."You've given me the time. Are you sure you're not fooling me?""Alright, Hao bu, I'm going back to work ..."What are you busy with?He wanted to ask more questions, but Li Hao didn't want to answer him. Hao lianchuan's heart was itching, but at this moment, he could only endure it. He cursed in his heart,"then I'll wait. I want to see if Yu Xiao will really appear tomorrow night to kill you ... Why don't I believe it!"If it was true, he could only say that this kid was a God!He racked his brain but still couldn't understand how he could trick that guy into taking the bait.This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.comThe breathing technique of five birds?Or something else?However, the other party was a superpower and might not be tempted. Even if he was tempted, he did not have to kill.At this moment, Hao lianchuan also began to deduce and think. After a long time, he gave up.Damn it, I don't know how to attract them!Otherwise, he would have tried it himself. As expected, this kid is capable. I've underestimated him.[PS: please give me some monthly votes. How pitiful. Do honest people not have monthly votes?]

 The White moon City was still bustling.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, returned to the Nightwalker's headquarters and paid no attention to the outside world. He went straight into Hao lianchuan's office and never came out.
 Hou Xiaochen still hadn't come out of seclusion, so he didn't have any missions.
 He had been recruited by hou Xiaochen, so it wasn't easy for the others to assign him any tasks.
 In the office.
 Hao lianchuan was busy with other things, so Li Hao didn't stay idle. He took out the 10 Blood God's illusions.
 A single one of them was only slightly stronger than those at the radiant sun tier.
 Although it would be of some help to Li Hao, it wouldn't be of much help.
 Li Hao's five organs had been strengthened to the point where he had almost stepped into the level of spirit accumulation. At this time, the blood gods of the glorious sun level were of no help to him, so what Li Hao was thinking now was whether he should eat five or ten of them together.
 10 pills, that was the amount of sunrise.
  He was worried that he would not be able to digest it.
 But after thinking about it ... Li Hao didn't think so.
 Sword energy also had the effect of helping with digestion.
 If it weren't for the help of his sword, he wouldn't have been able to quickly absorb several thousand cubic meters of mysterious energy.
 "Then eat five first. I don't think they're fried yet, so I'll eat the others quickly ..."
 Countless people were eyeing him covetously. At this point, Li Hao felt that even if he were to accumulate spirit energy, it wouldn't be reliable. Since he wasn't as strong as his teacher, he would reach the limit of a Martial Master in terms of physical fitness.
 If he couldn't raise his power, then he would raise other aspects.
 Blood change!
 This was also a path, and that was what he Yong had done. Li Hao had talked to He Yong before. Accumulating spirit might be the key to stepping into the next level, but strengthening the body, strengthening vitality, and completing the strengthening of vitality were also a kind of improvement.
 Even though he did not feel like he had broken through to a higher realm, it was a fact that his strength had increased.
 Douqian was only comparable to sunlight. However, He Yong's douqian could fight against three suns. It was not inferior to Yuan Shuo's douqian when he merged Five Forces.
 Li Hao had asked about the key to the blood transfusion, and he Yong had not hidden much. In fact, there was no need to hide it.
 It was very simple. He just had to continuously strengthen his body and inner strength.
 When one's body was extremely strong and the five internal organs were not weak, one would be able to keep up with the pace and make one's blood Qi stronger. This was also the path that many martial masters chose when they had no other choice after entering the universe.
 At this moment, Li Hao was actually thinking the same thing.
 The current him only had one type of earth sword force. If he continued to cultivate and cultivate, the effect would not be very good.
 Unless one's comprehension of the earth sword force was deeper, there would not be a huge improvement.
 While thinking about this, Li Hao swallowed five Blood God's illusions in one go.
 A powerful force of blood shadow instantly exploded in Li Hao's body.
 His blood was boiling!
  If he were in the Silver City, Li Hao would probably be able to see the eight trigrams.  Unfortunately, this was the White moon City.
 Li Hao raised his head to look at the sky, but he couldn't see anything.
 It was obvious that the eight trigrams only covered Silver City and not white moon City. Ying Hongyue had always wanted to get rid of Li Hao in Silver City, which was clearly related to the eight trigrams. It was very likely that Ying Hongyue knew about the existence of the eight trigrams.
 The powerful blood Qi gushed into Li Hao's body, causing his blood to boil.
 An ordinary Martial Master would not be able to withstand it.
 The most likely possibility was that the energy had been deposited in his body, just like when Li Hao first absorbed the power of the red shadow.
 However, the sword energy was still useful.
 He activated the breathing technique of five birds, and sword energy emerged. Li Hao began to destroy the divine power stones again to provide enough sword energy for the small sword.
 The divine power Stone had become a resource that Li Hao desperately needed.
 The divine power Stone that Yu Xiao had given him just now was shattered by him. A wave of energy overflowed and was quickly absorbed and converted by the small sword. The conversion rate was very low, but Li Hao was already very satisfied.
 It didn't matter if some were wasted, as long as the effect was good.
 In his body, his blood was boiling.
 Li Hao's five internal organs were powerful, so he didn't feel any burning or pain. His five internal organs were too powerful. Five Blood God's pearls were actually only comparable to the three suns. At this point, Li Hao could still bear it.
 Feeling that the pressure wasn't too great, Li Hao quickly swallowed the sixth pill, the seventh pill ...
 By the time he reached the eighth, Li Hao felt great pressure.
 The blood in his body began to boil.
 His blood even showed signs of transformation, like a surging River, flowing through his internal organs.
 At this moment, Li Hao could feel the existence of the Super Lock.
 One, two, three ...
  Five superpower shackles appeared in his five internal organs. Gradually, four superpower shackles appeared in his four limbs. In the blink of an eye, nine superpower shackles appeared and they were all extremely thick.
 According to Wang Ming, the number of super locks one could sense represented their super talent.
 But to Li Hao, it was meaningless.
 The powerful blood Qi poured into the Super locks, making them even more powerful. Li Hao only believed in his teacher. The strength of a Super Lock represented the depth of its Foundation. The stronger the Super Lock, the more Foundation it could contain.
 One day, when his martial arts broke through the superpower lock ... It might be a leap beyond imagination.
 Therefore, even though the Super locks were getting stronger and stronger, Li Hao didn't stop absorbing the blood Qi.
 The stronger the better!
 The more powerful he was, the more he would not be able to break the superpower lock easily in the future, regardless of whether he was able to fuse force, accumulate spirit force, or break force. As such, he would not be able to step into the realm of superpowers. The current Li Hao had no desire for superpowers.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Therefore, the power of the superpower lock did not affect his strength at all. It only made him feel confident.
 Seeing that the Super Lock had also begun to absorb the blood Qi, Li Hao no longer held back. He swallowed the remaining two clones of Blood God in one go. So far, he had swallowed all ten.

 The power of a red shadow at the sunrise level exploded in his body.
 "Ka ka ka"
 The bone armor began to shake as if it couldn't withstand it. His flesh and blood began to roll, and he felt a burning pain.
 Li Hao opened his mouth, and a divine power Stone appeared.
 This time, he didn't replenish the small sword's power. It was a Thunder-type divine power Stone. Li Hao knew that it could temper his bones with Thunder, but he rarely obtained Thunder Power.
 At that moment, he did not care about the value of the divine energy stone.
 He started devouring the Thunder energy in the sacred energy stone and used his sword energy to extract it. The Thunder energy that he extracted was purer than the mysterious energy. The Thunder energy was instantly integrated into his body and entered his bone armor.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 As if Thunder had rumbled, Li Hao's body and bone armor were stained with some purple. That was the effect of the lightning bone-honing.
 The bone armor made a cracking sound.
  Li Hao quickly stood up. Instead of sitting cross-legged, he began to practice the five birds fist technique and the Tiger fighting technique.
 It was easy to punch with sound, but difficult to punch without sound.
 As for Li Hao, in order to avoid making too much noise and attracting too much attention, he began to try the silent fist. His teacher was much better at this than him.
 His teacher practiced his fist techniques silently, as if he was training in retirement.
 As for Li Hao, despite his restraint, he still made some noise, but it wasn't too big. Plus, he was in Hao lianchuan's office, so no one dared to cause trouble.
 His fists were like thunder!
 Hurry up!
 However, being fast meant that one couldn't be silent. This was very contradictory, unless Li Hao could quickly withdraw the force of his punch and gather it in his body.
 BOOM!
 A weak explosion was heard. Li Hao didn't care about this and continued to practice his fist technique to help himself digest the energy.
 As for whether the great secret of the rising light realm below could sense it, Li Hao didn't care.
 The strength that he had displayed was not too strong.
 Even a Martial Master with over 100 points in cultivation could produce such a powerful punch.
 It could only be said that he practiced martial arts regardless of the occasion. It didn't matter if others saw him.
 In his body, the power of the blood shadow was still exploding. The energy of a blood shadow of the rising light realm was unimaginably dense.
 The SuperLock continued to appear and grow.
 Hualala!
 At this moment, the sound of chains being dragged could be heard in the room. Super-powered chains appeared on Li Hao's body and locked him firmly. At this moment, super-powered chains also appeared on his head.
 Nine?
 It was far more than that!
 The human body's potential was limitless. Not only did the organs and limbs have super locks, but other parts of the human body also had super locks.
 At this moment, Li Hao even felt that a Super Lock had appeared on the spine Dragon behind him.
 He was in a good mood as he absorbed the lightning energy to temper his bones and the blood Shadow Force to strengthen his inner strength, vitality, physical body, and Super Lock.
 Li Hao felt that his qi and blood were becoming more and more powerful!
 ……  Downstairs.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Majordomo Yu raised his head and took a look. It was as if he could see through the floor and see Li Hao. Vaguely, he seemed to see Li Hao practicing his fist technique. He was practicing the five birds technique. There were not many shadows of his fist, and the speed of his fist was not fast.
 But ... Chief Steward Yu still frowned slightly.
 Did he eat the blood God?
 How much did he eat?
 Li Hao didn't show his force, nor did he release his internal energy. He just practiced his fist techniques. When a Martial Master practiced his fist techniques, it was difficult to sense his opponent's strength. Without a real fight, it was often difficult to distinguish the strength of a Martial Master.
 However, as an expert, Chief Steward Yu could still sense something. He raised his eyebrows indistinctly.
 "Qian Dou?"
 She actually knew a little about Li Hao's battle of the thousand, but it was hard to say which level he had reached.
 There were many types of fighting Qian.
 There were the weakest ones, such as Liu Long, who had entered the warrior's Qian level. His five internal organs had not been honed, so his qi and blood were not strong.
 There were also slightly stronger ones whose qi and blood had transformed, their bones and bones had strengthened, and their five internal organs had been nurtured.
 There were even stronger ones, such as He Yong, who had entered the warrior's Qian realm, but had changed his blood many times. His body was strong, his bones were strong, and his five internal organs were also tempered.
 There was something even stronger, and that was Yuan Shuo's previous state. The five Forces had fused together, and his force was incomparably strong.
 What level was Li Hao at?
 She couldn't tell, and she didn't know how many Blood God pellets Li Hao had taken. Three or five?
 He wouldn't have taken all ten. If he had taken all ten, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to take it.
 It was the power of the rising light level. Even an ordinary three yang would find it difficult to withstand.
 Unless Li Hao's body had already reached the level of three yang. Was that possible?
 Chief Steward Yu fell into deep thought and sensed silently.
 Regarding Li Hao, apart from the descendants of the eight great families, no one really cared about him. What they cared about the most were his bloodline and his identity as Yuan Shuo's disciple.
 As for Li Hao's own strength, even though he had killed sun moxiian, he was very strong in the eyes of ordinary people, but in the eyes of the strong, he was only a Martial Master who had not even reached the thousand-man combat level.
 No matter how strong a Martial Master like this was, he could only reach the level of a sunlit expert.
 However, a large number of experts had gathered in the White moon City.
  Was sunlight ... Very powerful?
 "Perhaps ... He's stronger than everyone expected."
 Chief Steward Yu thought silently.
 ……
 Time passed by slowly.
 Li Hao kept practicing. The energy of the Sunglow wouldn't be used up so quickly. Moreover, Li Hao was still absorbing the energy of the divine power Stone, not the five elements this time.
 Instead, they mainly used lightning and wind energy.
 Lightning could temper one's bones, while wind could lighten one's body.
 If one's speed couldn't be increased, no matter how strong they were, they would only be targets.
 In the past, Li Hao cared more about the strength of his body. It was not that he did not care about his speed, but that he did not have much wind energy. Now, there were a few wind-type divine power stones among the divine power stones, and Li Hao absorbed them directly, not caring about the loss.

 There were only 12 divine power stones left. In addition to the one given by Yu Xiao, Li Hao actually didn't have many left.
 Moreover, the small sword was constantly being consumed.
 After Li Hao cultivated for a while and used up all the divine power stones of lightning and wind, he only had seven divine power stones left. Five of them were five-element divine power stones, and of the other two, one was pitch-black and the other was cold. Li Hao didn't dare to absorb them rashly.
 It might be the dark or ice element, so Li Hao was unwilling to absorb it rashly. The energy in the divine power Stone was abundant. If he wanted to absorb it, he would first absorb some mysterious energy. He would only absorb the divine power Stone after knowing its use.
 Li Hao was prepared to give all five attributes to Xiao Jian.
 The sword energy was the foundation.
 ……
 Hao lianchuan had been busy the entire morning.
 It was not until noon that he had some free time and was ready to go back to the office to rest.
 Before he entered the office, he frowned slightly. There was some noise in the office.
  Li Hao?
 Probably!
 This guy actually had nothing to do. He could go back after finishing his work in the morning, or go out and take a look at white moon City. But Li Hao didn 't.
 This guy was a workaholic.
 I won't leave until I get off work!
 However, the headquarters was small, and there was no place for Li Hao to work. He didn't have any official business to do either.
 "Are you training in my office?"
 Hao lianchuan thought to himself as he opened the office door.
 As soon as he opened the door, the light in Li Hao's eyes quickly receded, and his punches became weak. However, Hao lianchuan was, after all, a three-yang existence. At this moment, as he got close to Li Hao, he suddenly felt a bone-piercing feeling.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan glanced at Li Hao, who was still practicing. He laughed and said,""Department head, I'll borrow your office for cultivation. I have nowhere to go ... You don't mind, right?"
 Hao lianchuan nodded indifferently. He put down his briefcase and sat down on the sofa. He poured himself a cup of tea and took a sip. He then looked at Li Hao, who still hadn't stopped practicing.
 The bone armor also made a faint sound.
 It looked like it was the feeling of the bones and muscles twitching in unison when one cut Ten Realms.
 However, Hao lianchuan did not care about this. He was only trying to sense the Qi left in the office. The Qi was very weak, but when he got close, he felt a piercing pain.
 He didn't disturb Li Hao, but just watched in silence.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, acted as if no one else was present. He continued to practice his fist Arts and digest the remaining one-third of the rising light energy.
 In the morning, he had only digested two-thirds of it.
 However, as the energy decreased, his digestion speed became faster and faster.
 His five internal organs also felt much stronger than before.
 And this was only a part of it.
 Most importantly, Li Hao felt that his bone armor was much stronger than before.
 The blood in his body was surging like waves. This made Li Hao have the urge to punch Hao lianchuan. He even wanted to try and see if he could fight against this three suns with this punch, even without using force.
 Of course, he endured it.
 Endurance was for a better outburst.
 In this place, there was no one he could trust. The one he trusted the most was his teacher. Other than his teacher, perhaps it was his team leader.
 The members of the demon hunting squad were more trustworthy than anyone else here.  Liu Yan was also on night patrol, but Li Hao didn't go to see her, and Liu Yan didn't come to see Li Hao either. They kept their distance.
 This was the White moon City!
 Countless people were paying attention to Li Hao. If Liu Yan came to see Li Hao at this time, she would only attract attention, sidelong glances, and even be in danger.
 Liu Yan's absence also represented her wisdom.
 The Hao lianchuan in front of her might be a good person ... But who knew what he was thinking deep down?
 A good person?
 Would a good person want to kill the superior three suns?
 Looking around, in the entire Whitemoon city ... How many people were worthy of his trust?
 Li Hao, on the other hand, could only rely on himself.
 With these two fists, with the sword in his hand!
 If the sword was not sharp enough, how could it survive in this place?
 The thoughts in his heart were displayed in his fist.
 At this moment, Li Hao's fist was still weak, but it was full of killing intent.
 He wanted to create a new world!
 Just like the Demon King he saw in the illusion, he killed the world and stopped the war with a knife!
 The red moon, the night patrolman ...
 It was too complicated!
 Li Hao didn't want to get to know them in depth. There was no need to. He just wanted to say,"even if I have the bloodline of the eight great families, don't come to me. I'm just an ordinary student, so why drag me into this?"
 ……
 Hao lianchuan's expression turned serious.
 The teacup in his hand did not move again.
 Li Hao's punches were getting fiercer and faster.
 What was this guy thinking?
 He ... Has he already reached the warrior power level?
 This fist intent ... Wasn't a type of force, but it seemed to be changing. Could it be that Li Hao had comprehended a second type of force?
  He frowned. He didn't know much about martial masters.
 However, he had a vague feeling that ... Li Hao's fist intent seemed to be stronger than the Shi comprehended by some martial masters. Why wasn't it Shi?
 There was only one possibility!
 He had cheated!
 After stepping into the thousand warrior tier, it was even more difficult to comprehend force. Moreover, Li Hao already had one type of force, so the second type of force was not so easy to convert. If Li Hao's current force was still above 100, he might be able to directly convert this fist intent into force.
 The terrifying brat felt that it was only because of his special identity that many people had overlooked his talent.
 Force was not something that anyone could comprehend.
 Everyone was looking down on Li Hao.
 ……
 Li Hao didn't care about Hao lianchuan. He continued to practice his fist technique.

 Tiger fist!
 Among the five birds technique, the Tiger fighting technique was the most offensive and focused on killing.
 Li Hao had seen a Tiger before, but it was only a tiger in a cage. It was as if he was trapped in a cage, just like himself. Even if the cage was infinitely large, he was still trapped in a cage.
 He gave a fake smile and said insincere words.
 Everyone wanted to live a more real life!
 But could he ... Do it?
 He couldn 't!
 Only by breaking the cage can one see his true self.
 But can I break this cage?
 Li Hao was unwilling, but he could only be unwilling.
  Hou Xiaochen had saved him, so he had to show his worth to him. That was why he had revealed his sword force.
 Hou Xiaochen had told him to come to Whitemoon city. Even if he wanted to stay in Silver City, he still came because he had no other choice.
 His teacher had left because the Crimson Moon wanted to kill him ... And this was all because his teacher had killed many Crimson Moon experts ... And this reason was actually also because of Li Hao.
 People were always so helpless!
 At this moment, Li Hao had many thoughts in his mind. He had reached the peak of Tiger fighting technique. It wasn't like a tiger's carefreeness, but a desire to break out of its cage!
 I want to break this cage!
 But I can 't!
 His complicated emotions were integrated into the secret technique of five birds. He punched and retracted.
 Hao lianchuan looked at it for a while and suddenly felt very uncomfortable.
 The feeling of not being able to punch to his heart's content, the feeling of sullenness, the feeling of pulling back his fist halfway after throwing it out, made him feel like vomiting blood.
 What kind of punch was this?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Tiger fighting technique?
 He had seen the Tiger fighting technique and Yuan Shuo's fist before. It was very strong, very hearty, and very valiant. His killing intent was monstrous, like a fierce tiger coming down the mountain, intimidating the forest.
 However, Li Hao's Tiger fighting technique had a completely different feeling.
 "Cough, cough, cough ..."
 He couldn't help but cough madly. He didn't do it on purpose. He really felt uncomfortable watching it, so uncomfortable that he couldn't breathe.
 Li Hao, who had been punching, suddenly stopped.
 He looked at Hao lianchuan and frowned slightly.
 He was so excited that department head Hao shouldn't have interrupted him.
 Hao lianchuan let out a long breath and panted,""I'm sorry, but ... It's really too uncomfortable. Li Hao, is this Tiger fighting technique?"
 Li Hao nodded slightly.
 Hao lianchuan panted for a while and said hesitantly,""Why ... Is it different from your teacher 's? Also, did you stop halfway through?"
 He could not help but ask.
 Li Hao smiled."Even if there's only one type of secret technique, it varies from person to person. The secret technique might not be the same. As for stopping halfway, it's not so. It's just that I haven't found the target and the direction of my punch."  Hao lianchuan did not fully understand.
 "This punch of yours is less domineering, but more ... Suffocating!" He exhaled once again.
 Li Hao nodded, still thinking about the punch just now.
 The five birds technique was the first secret technique he had come into contact with and also the secret technique he had cultivated the most.
 He had a feeling that if he was still breaking through 100, he might have comprehended a kind of force, not the kind of Tiger Force that his teacher had, but another kind of Tiger Force.
 Who said that a tiger in a cage had no power?
 "Director, is there a Zoo nearby?" Li Hao suddenly asked.
 "Ah?"
 Hao lianchuan didn't know what to do with his jump. After a while, he said,""I think so. You can ask Wang Ming, he might know."
 "Alright!"
 At this moment, Li Hao suddenly wanted to see a Tiger. He didn't want to see an ordinary tiger in a cage. He wanted to see a Tiger that was locked up in a cage and always wanted to jump out.
 Those Tigers who were used to it, who were comfortable and unwilling to escape, did not match his fist.
 "Minister, I'll go down first."
 "Go, but be careful."
 "Don't run around," Hao lianchuan said."Don't go too far. You might attract some trouble."
 At this moment, he still wanted to fish for Yu Xiao.
 It might not be a good thing to attract a group of martial masters.
 "I won't go far," Li Hao nodded.
 He just wanted to take a look around.
 If it was too far, he would not go.
 ……
 Downstairs.
 Li Hao waited for a while before Wang Ming finally arrived.
  This guy wasn't at the Nightwalker headquarters earlier. He probably went out for a meal, but he had just returned with his mouth full of oil. When he saw Li Hao, he laughed and said,""I was going to ask you out for dinner, but you disappeared, so I didn't look for you."
 "Is there a Zoo nearby? Or rather, Where can I find a Tiger that has just been caught ... The kind that has just been caught, and the kind that is wild?"
 Wang Ming was startled. Tiger?
 After a while, he thought about it and said,"well ... Let me think. The zoo does have it, but I don't know if it's just caught. I'll ask for you. The zoo might not have it, but some of my friends might."
 Li Hao was suspicious.
 Wang Ming laughed heartily."With the rise of supers, some of my friends are supers as well. They like to play, some like to hunt, and they'll go to some deep mountains and old forests nearby. If they go, they might catch a tiger or something ... After all, times are different now, and raising a Tiger is more impressive than raising a dog!"
 Li Hao didn't say anything.
 Wang Ming didn't say much, and quickly made a call to inquire.
 He had a deep network and knew many people.
 After making five or six calls, a happy expression appeared on his face. He quickly hung up the communication and laughed,""There it is! I have a friend who caught a fierce tiger the day before yesterday. It's a big, multicolored Tiger with a wild nature! Unfortunately, he hasn't eaten or drunk anything in the past few days since he was captured. My friend is currently training him ... Li Hao, do you want to go and take a look?"

 He thought that Li Hao was bored and wanted some excitement.
 Of course, among the secret skills of five birds, there was also the Tiger fighting technique. Perhaps he was trying to comprehend the Tiger fighting technique?
 Who cares!
 He was just a ferocious Tiger. In the past, he might have been an existence that could not be provoked. Now, any Yueming or a cultivator with a cultivation level above 100 could easily deal with him.
 Now, other than beasts that had gained intelligence, no other beast was a threat to humans.
 "Is it far?"
 "It's not far ..."
 As Wang Ming said this, he suddenly smiled and said,"afraid of danger?" I'll get my friend to send it over directly, it's not a waste of time anyway. "
 "No need, we'll go take a look if it's not far."
 "Alright then!"
  Wang Ming chuckled and quickly pulled Li Hao out.
 When he reached white moon City, he was no longer a car-less race.
 At that moment, Wang Ming very quickly drove out an extremely flashy red car, which was particularly eye-catching.
 ,m Sitting in the car, Wang Ming looked at Li Hao on the side of the road and chuckled."Get in the car, What are you looking at! It's my own car. I have a lot of cars in the White moon City, but I couldn't transport them to the Silver City last time, so I didn't bring them. "  Li Hao didn't say anything and jumped into the car.
 With a bang, Wang Ming started the car at an extremely fast speed.
 In the Urban area, because this guy was a superhuman, his reaction speed was fast. He was not afraid of accidents, and his speed instantly exceeded 100 miles per hour, and he continued to accelerate.
 Li Hao didn't say anything. Although he didn't think it was good, the people of white moon City seemed to be used to it, so there was no need for him to say anything.
 As he drove, Wang Ming said loudly, "We'll be there soon. My friend is also a super, but he's only at the Dark Moon realm. He's not a night patrolman or an organization, and he's an independent cultivator. His father's status isn't low, and he's an important figure in the administration Bureau. In terms of status, he can be ranked in the top ten in the administration Bureau. But don't worry, we're not afraid of him!"
 Li Hao didn't say anything. He didn't care. He just wanted to see the Tiger.
 ……
 In less than ten minutes, the car stopped at the entrance of a Manor.
 It was indeed very close.
 Some of them were close to the southern suburbs, but even so, there was a small Manor here, which was not ordinary.
 At the entrance, a young man saw the car stop and laughed.""Old Wang, you've come back pretty quickly. You've finally returned from the Silver City, that godforsaken place. I thought you'd been exiled!"
 "You're the one who's been exiled!"
 Wang Ming chuckled and jumped out of the car. He called Li Hao and quickly said,"Zhou Qin, stop talking nonsense. Where's the Tiger? My brother wants to see a ferocious Tiger ..."
 The young man glanced at Li Hao and asked in confusion,""This person ... Can you introduce him?"
 "My senior brother!"
 Wang Ming laughed and didn't say much."Cut the crap, why are you asking so many questions!"
 "Alright!"
  The young man didn't ask any more questions. He just looked at Li Hao a few more times. Li Hao nodded slightly. The young man had wanted to make fun of him, but he suddenly felt a little awkward. This man ... Made him feel a little uncomfortable.  He couldn't say what he felt, but he felt that ... He felt that it was very similar to the Tiger he caught the day before yesterday.
 At this moment, he suddenly thought of the Tiger.
 Usually, he would stay in the cage without moving. However, once he got close, he would jump up instantly and hurt people at the slightest opportunity. He was unruly and had been training for several days, but it was useless.
 The Tiger did not eat or drink, and its wild nature was difficult to tame.
 He was prepared to train for a few more days. If there was no effect, he would throw it away or kill it to eat meat.
 This Zhou Qin was quite efficient.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Since Wang Ming wanted to take a look, Li Hao didn't waste any time. He led the two of them through a rockery. A moment later, Li Hao saw a huge cage, and inside the metal cage was a brightly colored Tiger, crouching on the ground, motionless.
 Zhou Qin explained,"don't look at how it's motionless now. As long as you get close to it, this thing will immediately pounce on you. I was almost scratched by it before."
 "This Tiger, although it's just an ordinary wild beast, if it were an ordinary Starlight master, they probably wouldn't be able to handle it. At that time, in order to catch it, some of my people were injured."
 Wang Ming was surprised."That can't be. You're both dark moons. How could you have been injured by it?"
 "It's true!"
 While Zhou Qin was talking, Li Hao had already walked over.
 He was usually not so anxious, but at this moment, he was suddenly very anxious.
 ……
 In the cage.
 The Tiger did not move.
 Even when Li Hao approached it, it didn't move. There was still some coagulated blood on its gorgeous skin. It was clearly injured.
 As Li Hao got closer and closer, Zhou Qin, who was behind him, was about to remind him ...
 At this moment, a tiger's roar reverberated through the manor.
 In the gap of the metal cage, a huge Tiger's Claw suddenly clawed at Li Hao. Li Hao looked into the Tiger's eyes ... It was a look of anger, despair, and unwillingness.
  This Tiger was not willing to accept this!
 The Tiger's claws were extremely sharp, and it suddenly clawed at Li Hao at an extremely fast speed!
 BOOM!
 Its huge body crashed into the cage. The Tiger's claws were only a short distance away from Li Hao, but it couldn't reach him no matter how hard it tried. The Tiger roared madly, and the entire cage trembled violently.
 "Roar!"
 The roars continued, and gradually, the Tiger gave up and lay down again.
 Li Hao just watched and experienced it in silence.
 Feel it!
 He got a little closer. The next moment, the Tiger clawed at him again without a sound. This time, it was faster, sharper, and more violent!
 The roars were no longer heard, only anger and unwillingness remained!

 With a loud bang, the cage trembled violently again.
 Li Hao approached again and suddenly threw a punch. This punch landed on its claw, and blood oozed out. The Tiger didn't care and madly clawed at Li Hao!
 He still couldn't catch it!
 It went mad, and its teeth began to tear at the cage. It struggled again and again, trying to break out, but it was unable to succeed.
 This continued for a very long time!
 At this moment, Zhou Qin also looked at Li Hao in surprise. He said to Wang Ming in a low voice,"Your friend ... What is he doing?"
 "I don't know,"
 Wang Ming shook his head. He didn't know what Li Hao was up to either. He punched him a few times, as if he were abusing this Tiger.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com ……
 Li Hao watched in silence.
  He punched the Tiger again, forcing it to retreat. The next moment, the Tiger pounced again, tearing at the cage and grabbing Li Hao.
 Again and again, the other party did not know fatigue or pain.
 Gradually, the despair in the other's eyes increased.
 Just as Li Hao thought that it had given up ...
 At this moment, with a crack, the Tiger pounced again. This time, its teeth bit into one of the gaps in the metal. With a crack, the teeth broke. It had bitten a huge gap in the metal railing.
 The next moment, the Tiger slammed into the railing and broke it with a bang.
 Zhou Qin was shocked, not because he was afraid, but because he was afraid of hurting Wang Ming's friend ...
 However, Li Hao didn't move at all, allowing the Tiger to pounce at him.
 In the next moment, a Tiger's Claw swiped at his head.
 Li Hao raised his hand and punched again. With a loud bang, the Tiger was sent flying.
 Li Hao stepped forward. The Tiger that had been sent flying was still struggling and had suffered heavy injuries.
 Li Hao exhaled."You know that there's no way out. You know that you're going to die. You know that I'm powerful ... But you still use your claws again and again ... Are you not afraid of death?"
 The fierce tiger was silent.
 However, he still struggled.
 Li Hao raised his hand, and the Tiger once again waved its claws at Li Hao. Li Hao grabbed its claws and injected some sword energy into it, but the Tiger continued to struggle.
 Li Hao directly grabbed its claws and stuffed it into the cage.
 He turned around and looked at Zhou Qin. After thinking for a while, he said,"This friend, this Tiger is unruly. I beg for a favor, can you let it go back to the mountain?"
 Zhou Qin was stunned.
 At this time, Li Hao took out something from his pocket. It was a piece of bone."Here is 5 cubic meters of fire-type mysterious energy ..."
 Zhou Qin understood now and hurriedly said,"don 't. I originally wanted to let it go. This thing was just looking for something new, but in the end, I couldn't raise it well. I even dislike it taking up space. You're old Wang's friend, so you're my friend. It's just a small matter. I'll get someone to send it back later!"
  "Many thanks!"  Li Hao thanked him and didn't stand on ceremony.
 He glanced at Wang Ming and said with a smile,"I'm done. You can go back!"
 "You're not looking?"
 Wang Ming was a little surprised. What did that mean?
 Did he come here just to let the Tiger return to the mountain?
 "I'm leaving. Please thank this brother for me when you return!"
 After Li Hao finished speaking, he waved at Zhou Qin and strode away.
 Behind him, the Tiger seemed to have understood. It lay on the ground motionlessly and watched Li Hao leave.
 ……
 Li Hao, who had just walked out of the manor, suddenly smiled.
 Even if he was trapped in a cage, he still wouldn't give up?
 Despite knowing the danger, he still wanted to break out of the cage, just for a fight to the death?
 The teacher was watching the Tiger of the king roaring in the forest!
 But what I saw today was a trapped beast still fighting.
 These were two completely different feelings and auras, but at this moment, Li Hao felt that they suited him very well.
 Back then, his teacher had dominated the world, and he was a fierce tiger that had come down the mountain.
 "As for me, I'm now trapped in white moon City, surrounded by danger. I'm the Tiger in the cage!
 A trapped beast was still fighting!
 As Li Hao walked, he sensed something. Behind him, Wang Ming's expression gradually changed. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have transformed into a fierce tiger, silently lying in wait, as if waiting for an opportunity to devour someone!
  He suddenly felt a chill down his spine!
 This Li Hao ... What's wrong?
 Did he realize something?
 He had also learned the five birds technique, but he had not felt anything.
 ……
 At this moment, Li Hao was like a tiger with a chest.
 The shape of a ferocious Tiger gradually appeared in his divine intent. It was silent and silent as it lay in wait.
 So what if I'm trapped in a cage?
 He would break out of the cage one day!
 The might of a Tiger was revealed!

 In the sports car.
 Li Hao was like a tiger on the ground. He was clearly sitting, but Wang Ming, who was driving, felt like a tiger was lying next to him.
 He was breaking out in cold sweat.
 Li Hao was really different today.
 Was this enlightenment?
 ……
 At this moment, Li Hao was deep in thought with his eyes closed.
 Divine decree!
 This was the first time he could clearly feel the divine intent and the true intent of martial Dao.
 Whether it was comprehending the sword force or the terrain, it was all due to luck and coincidences. His ancestor's longevity sword had created the sword force and the terrain. It was because Liu Long's ninth refinement force had collided with his teacher's five birds force. That time could be considered an epiphany.
  Only the comprehension of the Tiger's momentum for the five birds technique could be said to be an epiphany, but it was actually not.
 Instead, it was his emotions and his martial Dao that had reached an explosive point.
 Today, he had exploded.
 He had observed the Tiger imprisoning beast and formed a resonance with it. He had used his body to replace the Tiger, which was why he had the momentum now.
 Yes, the Tiger's momentum had been formed!
 In the five birds technique, the Tiger's momentum was water, which ran through the kidney.
 But Li Hao didn't care.
 Water?
 It wasn 't!
 Hong Yitang had once explained to him the essence of "force". The essence of "force" did not have any attribute. Liu Long's "ninth refinement force" was water, but his father's was fire. They were the same secret technique and the same cultivation method.
 His Tiger aura was different from his teacher 's.
 What attribute? it depended on which attribute he was matched with.
 A trapped beast was like a tiger in a cage.
 This wasn't water. Water was soft. His Tiger desired to kill. He desired to explode. He didn't want to hold back anymore. He gushed out like a flame, hoping to burn this land.
 There was fire in his heart!
 Fire!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com That's right, his Tiger aura was neither water nor gold. On the contrary, it was a Tiger that thirsted for fire.
 Fire!
 Li Hao knew that this Tiger was the fire in his heart. His teacher's ape was the fire in heart ape, while he was the fire in heart Tiger. They were two completely different styles. Just like Liu Long and his father, one of them forged Fire Force, while the other forged water force.
 In his heart, the Tiger had entered his heart!
 His heart seemed to be on fire, and a huge chain was about to lock this Tiger in the cage, making this Tiger even more furious and crazy.
 You also want to lock me up?
 The nature of a tiger in a cage was to be unwilling to be bound.
 However, at this moment, the chains in its heart were locking it down. It was unwilling to give up. It roared madly, roared madly, and bit madly.
 Li Hao's expression was calm.
 'Endure it, endure it. I've locked you up today so that I can release you more violently in the future. The fire Tiger sword momentum will be my next target.'
 The sword of Mount di was as heavy as a mountain and had a majestic aura.
 However, it was still not lethal enough.
 Li Hao began to use heart lock on fire Tiger. The chain was extremely thick and much more powerful than the previous lock on earth mountain. A sunrise-realm Blood God's clone greatly increased his potential and strengthened his Super Lock.
 "Roar!"  At that moment, it was as if a fierce tiger was roaring in Wang Ming's ear. His face was a little pale, and he turned his head to look at Li Hao again.
 What was this?
 Force?
 Li Hao, have you comprehended Tiger Force?
 ……
 Li Hao didn't care about Wang Ming. The Tiger was locked by his Super Lock, but it was still struggling madly, and his heart was beating continuously.
 Very good!
 This was the force that he wanted. If it was like the earth mountain sword, locked and not moving, then it would not be a tiger in a cage.
 This power might not be stronger than the earth mountain sword.
 In fact, he was even a little inferior.
 However, his drive, indomitable spirit, and unyielding madness were similar to Li Hao 's. It was a feeling that could only be experienced when one's body was immersed in the mind. If Yuan Shuo were here, he would probably be shocked.
 He would tell Li Hao that only today could Li Hao truly be considered to have entered the door of thousand-man combat.
 Yes, this was Li Hao's comprehension and achievements in martial arts.
 He had the intention!
 This was the third type of force that Li Hao had comprehended. In fact, it could also be regarded as the second type. He had turned sword force into a general principle. He was no longer willing to separate it from his body and turn it into metal force. Instead, he wanted to control all the major forces.
 The starting point of the sword momentum was too high.
 This sword force had a very powerful origin. It was formed by the sword intent of a peerless expert. At this moment, it forcefully merged with the Golden Force, weakening the sword force instead.
 In his body, some of the remaining blood shadow energy was repairing some of the injuries he had just sustained.
 Very quickly, his injuries were healed.
 Li Hao had fused the second type of force, which was the heart force. At this point, his heart and spleen were both nourished by a force.
 When the fierce tiger transformed into the fire Tiger sword and integrated into the sword momentum, it would definitely be stronger.
 At this moment, Li Hao had to attack someone!
 To vent the fire in his heart!
 Although Li Hao had closed his eyes and ignored his surroundings, he could still vaguely feel some gazes on him. Someone was still following him, but he had come out too suddenly and hadn't returned home yet, so these people were caught off guard.
 He didn't have time to make a move.
 This was exactly the result Li Hao wanted.
 ……
 Dongcheng hotel.
 Hu Qingfeng also received the news quickly. He said in surprise,""Li Hao just went out to see a Tiger ... What is he doing?"
  At the side, Yu Xiao also cursed in his heart.
 What are you running for?
 He didn't obediently go back to draw, but instead went to see the Tiger. Wasn't he too idle?
 "It was probably instigated by that Wang Ming ..."
 Yu Xiao explained. He didn't want Hu Qingfeng to focus too much on Li Hao, so he quickly changed the topic."Li Hao told me today that hou Xiaochen will definitely come out of seclusion within three days!"
 "Hmph!"
 "Hmph!" Hu Qingfeng snorted."I think his so-called closed-door cultivation is just a cover. Maybe he's already out."
 Yu Xiao didn't speak.
 That might not be the case!
 Perhaps hou Xiaochen was really injured. Otherwise, he would have eaten Li Hao Long ago. He was probably recuperating now to eat Li Hao better.

 Hu Qingfeng didn't say anything else. He was just thinking.
 "Then, Li Hao, are you willing to hand over the blood?"
 "Right!"
 "How would he dare to refuse?" Yu Xiao laughed,"besides, that guy doesn't know anything. When I said I was from the headquarters, his expression was even more enthusiastic than when he saw his own father. He probably doesn't understand hou Xiaochen's thoughts."
 Hu Qingfeng nodded.
 That was true.
 In the eyes of the Nightwatchers, the experts from the headquarters were worthy of respect. In the entire Silvermoon Nightwatcher, there were only a few higher-ups who could vaguely understand hou Xiaochen's thoughts.
 He didn't say anything else. Yu Xiao had also said that Li Hao needed a day or two before he could provide him with heart blood. Yu Xiao didn't want ordinary blood.
 Hu Qingfeng didn't think there was anything wrong with this.
 Being able to obtain the heart blood was the best result.
  ……
 White moon City.
 In a small courtyard in the southern part of the city.
 He Yong touched his big beard and looked at the person in front of him. He frowned and said,""You went to see the Tiger? A captured Tiger ... Comprehending Tiger Force? But I don't think it's possible. Li Hao isn't as overbearing as his teacher, and he isn't as crazy as Yuan Shuo. I'm afraid he won't be able to understand the Tiger's momentum!"
 His first thought was to comprehend force.
 However, it was almost impossible.
 Momentum also depended on the person.
 It wasn't as if he had never come into contact with Li Hao. Even if he had some ulterior motives, he was still different from Yuan Shuo. This kid was too young, and he had always been protected and suppressed. It was almost impossible for him to comprehend the tyrannical aura of a fierce tiger.
 It's a waste of time to look!
 Moreover, it was a Tiger that was being held captive, so it was even more impossible.
 He Yong laughed and shook his head."Children are so naive. Do you think you can comprehend force just by looking at tigers and bears?" The five birds force is not that simple. "
 He didn't say anything more and waved his hand.""Go. Remember, just watch and don't interfere. Hou Xiaochen is still in the city, not dead. Don't be as stupid as the others. If you do something right now, even if you succeed, who can run away once hou Xiaochen comes out?"
 He had some understanding of Li Hao's situation.
 He wasn't too interested in the breathing technique of five birds or the blood God at the level of Xuguang.
 Although it was better to have it, it was the same without it.
 p At this time, whoever had any ideas about Li Hao was gambling with their lives. He Yong had no interest in gambling his life for a small thing. As an instructor of the royal family, he didn't lack these treasures.  More than that, he was still lacking some insights and guidance on his future path.
 ……
 People were discussing Li Hao everywhere.
 This guy had gone to see the Tiger once, and it had caused many people to guess. Many people felt that he might have gone to comprehend the momentum of the Tiger, but they were not too optimistic.
 Anyone who knew Yuan Shuo would know what kind of Tiger he was.
  That was the true King of the Mountains!  Yuan Shuo had only comprehended the Tiger aura after he had defeated Silver Moon. He had to fight dozens of famous martial masters before he could truly comprehend the Tiger aura and its overbearing power.
 Li Hao ... Was still far from that!
 It couldn't even be considered a young tiger.
 ……
 The night patrolman.
 Li Hao stepped through the door again with a smile. At this moment, his anger was restrained, almost completely integrated into the Tiger aura. He looked gentler, as all his emotions had been swallowed by the Tiger.
 When Hao lianchuan saw Li Hao again, he was a little surprised.
 This was because Li Hao gave him a very pure feeling.
 He was like a real student.
 Before, Li Hao had felt that he was pretending, but now, his smile seemed to be genuine.
 Hao lianchuan also felt that he couldn't see through Li Hao. He frowned slightly, but quickly relaxed and said,""Hu dingfang called again and asked me to protect you. He heard what you said today and wants you to be careful. Also, he wants you to stay away from Wang Ming, who's a trap!"
 Li Hao smiled.
 "Minister, please thank him on my behalf, but I don't need general Hu's concern," he said after some thought.
 He thought for a moment and said,"it's useless for general Hu to put in effort with me. As long as teacher thinks there's no problem, then there's no problem." It's not a good choice to influence teacher through me ... He has helped me too much, but that's my problem. I don't want to affect teacher through me. "
 "What's wrong?"Hao lianchuan laughed. Isn't that good?"
 "It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's unnecessary. "
 "Director," Li Hao said,"I want to see the sea in two days. Are you interested in going with me?"
 The ocean?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan was stunned for a moment before he nodded.""Yes, but Baiyue's sea is only an internal sea. It can't be considered boundless in the true sense. If you want to see the real ocean, you have to go further south. The ocean in the South is much wider than the ocean in the North. "
 "We'll talk about it when we have the chance. "
  Li Hao looked around and said,"department head, can you give me an office or something? I like to clock in to work. It's not convenient to stay in your office all the time."
 “……”
 Are you F * cking addicted to work?
 "I still feel that you're going to be the Deputy Minister. Only the Deputy Minister has his own office and some finance and other things.
 This guy ... Was really interesting.
 He thought for a moment and said,"there's no space on the fifth floor. There's an empty office on the fourth floor, but it's closer to Secretary Yu. Do you want it?"
 "Is there really one?"
 Li Hao was a little surprised. He could really get one?
 "It's just an office!"
 Hao lianchuan didn't care too much about it. He laughed and said,""Besides ... The others don't want to be neighbors with that person. If you don't mind, you can pack up and move in."

 Although Chief Steward Yu was a little more reliable, other than hou Xiaochen, he treated everyone else with a cold face.
 Therefore, the other Nightwatchers would rather stay on another floor than be neighbors with that person.
 Li Hao didn't mind.
 It was pretty good!
 On the second day he came to white moon City, he had an office in the headquarters. He liked it very much and was thinking about whether he should go to Silver City to bring that silk banner ... But forget it, he would still go back to Silver City.
 That silk banner will be hung in Silver City.
 ……
 Li Hao didn't do anything else that afternoon.
 He had been cleaning the office and packing up his things, seriously preparing to move in.
 This time, even some of the secretaries and drivers on the fourth floor were a little surprised. There was really someone who dared to stay here?
  Many people peeked at chief Yu for a while, but he didn't care at all. This time, some people had to give up on the gossip. They could only say that Li Hao, this newcomer, was very bold!
 Li Hao was busy all the way until it was time to get off work. He was in a good mood as he looked at his new office.
 It was about 40 square meters, not too small.
 There were all kinds of desks, coffee tables, and sofas for guests. Although it was not as good as in Silver City, every inch of land here was worth its weight in gold. To have an office of his own here, it was indeed easier to do things with someone in the court.
 Department head Hao had been assigned to an office with just one sentence.
 After admiring the fruits of his labor, Li Hao walked out of the office in satisfaction. He locked the office and took the key.
 In the corridor.
 Chief Steward Yu had just left the room. When he saw Li Hao lock the door, he raised his eyebrows.
 'This guy ... Is ... Is really interesting.
 Did he really think this was his territory?
 He was really preparing to go to work?
 Looking at the time, it was Sixo' clock, just in time to get off work. He checked in to work, but didn't leave early after work ... Chief Steward Yu couldn't even describe his feelings at this moment.
 "Li Hao!"
 "Chief Yu!"
 Li Hao followed the crowd and greeted the steward enthusiastically,""Chief, you're off work?"
 “……”
 Chief Steward Yu had never known what it felt like to get off work, and she almost never left this building.
 After hearing this, he was slightly stunned before slowly nodding his head.""Time to knock off!"
 "Together, chief?"
 "No need,"
 Chief Steward Yu looked at him for a while, then left without saying anything.
 Together? what the hell? she wasn't leaving, so how could they be together?
 "Goodbye, chief. I'm going home now!"
 Li Hao was all smiles. He was in a good mood. Today was a day worth being happy.
 He went downstairs. Instead of driving or riding, he walked to the family building.  At that moment, the light bulb appeared again after the night patrolman left.
 But Li Hao didn't care.
 These people were not worthy of him drawing his sword.
 Moreover, they didn't dare to do anything rashly at the moment. At the very least, they had to observe clearly before they dared to make a move.
 They had to see if there was anyone following and protecting Li Hao. Who would dare to act rashly without knowing the arrangements of the Nightwalker?
 Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to know nothing.
 On the way, he bought a few buns and a portion of beef noodles. He didn't like to trouble others. Although the inspector could deliver food to his door, Li Hao didn't want to trouble them.
 As long as he was self-sufficient, it was not too expensive. Why would he care about such a small amount of money when he was a high-wage person?
 ……
 "Is there really no one to take care of this kid?"
 At this moment, some people were secretly suspicious that Li Hao was really left alone.
 Did the night watchman think that he didn't need to care because he didn't live far away?
 Or did they think that no one would dare to touch Li Hao since hou Xiaochen was in the city?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They carefully observed the area, and there was indeed no one.
 Apart from hou Xiaochen, who was in seclusion, and Hao lianchuan, who was still busy in the building, the other night patrollers all had their own missions. Almost all the night patrollers in the sun glory realm were busy.
 The only one who wasn't busy was probably Wang Ming.
 But Wang Ming had long since driven his luxury car and ran off after dropping off Li Hao in the afternoon. Some people were also observing Wang Ming, who had really gone out to have fun and wasn't in South City at all.
 ……
 He went upstairs and went home.
 He opened the door.
 Li Hao smiled as if nothing had happened, but he was surprised ... Did Red Moon have someone else?
 There was actually a red shadow at home.
 Taking advantage of Hao lianchuan's absence, Red moon's cultivators probably sneaked over. They didn't see any supers, only a red shadow. They probably thought that the red shadow was unlikely to be exposed. At this moment, the red shadow was right in front of Li Hao.
 Before, Li Hao would have been trembling in fear.
  But at this moment ... He was really used to it.
 He also sensed that it was around the early stage of the glorious sun realm. He knew it just by looking at the size of the red shadow. He had eaten a lot of this thing. Now, when he saw the red shadow, he always felt like he had seen food and wanted to eat it in one bite.
 The people of the Crimson Moon were really bold.
 Did another expert come, or did Zi Yue recover from her injuries?
 Hong Yue was more concerned about Li Hao than anyone else.
 They were afraid that Li Hao would die, afraid that Li Hao's whereabouts would be out of their control. Li Hao had to admit that most of the time, he thought that the only person in white moon City who cared about his life so much was probably Crimson Moon!
 In the loneliness, it was inevitable to feel a little sad.
 The red moon was still the best!
 Li Hao didn't do anything else. He ate a bun and sat in front of the desk. Beside him, the red shadow also watched silently, as if a parent was urging his child to study.
 Li Hao began to draw.
