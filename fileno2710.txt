The place was too big!Two to three months was still the right path.One wrong step and the direction was wrong, and the difference could be huge ... However, venerable sovereigns rarely took the wrong path. In the vast chaos, other than the neo martial human Kings who were said to often take the wrong path, the other venerable sovereigns were actually fine.Unless they were in a real battle and lost their sense of direction, it was normal to get lost.I heard you say that there are other venerable sovereigns active in the vicinity of new martial arts ... Will it be a little troublesome?"Yi shook his head."That has nothing to do with us. Naturally, someone will deal with it. In order to deal with the guerrilla warfare of neo martial, Hongyue has recruited a large number of individual cultivators. It's not just individual cultivators. You know, a large number of venerable sovereigns in the tianfang world actually have some ideas recently and have been active!"In other words, those people would also make a move.It was only a matter of time.They were weak, so they left first, but the others were strong. They might be able to catch up with them even if they delayed their departure for a few months.Li Hao nodded again and asked curiously,""I know about the Silvermoon world. It's a subsidiary world of the yin-yang world. It's said that it can be exchanged for a middle-level world. Did anyone take down the Silvermoon recently?""No, I didn 't,"Yi shook his head again."But Silver moon's whereabouts have been revealed. Someone encountered him before, and it was mainly a second-tier Beast of Chaos. However, it seems that there was also a venerable sovereign. The two venerable sovereigns joined forces and injured a second-tier venerable sovereign before they fled the place ... Someone said that Silver Moon is currently meeting up with neo martial and is rushing in the direction of celestial pole and King Huai. We might be able to meet him!"He went to find new martial arts?Li Hao's heart moved.Also, another venerable sovereign had been born ... It should not be the master of the great Dao, nor Lin Hongyu. It was most likely the celestial pole.In a year's time, Hong Yitang and the others should not be far from the venerable sovereign level.This year, the Silver Moon should have a development period, and the great path universe would definitely not be weak.However, he might be lacking an opportunity.These three were only a step away from becoming venerable sovereigns. If he could return, Silver Moon would probably be able to give birth to three venerable sovereigns. With the celestial pole clone, Black Panther, and himself, Silver Moon would be able to give birth to a total of six venerable sovereigns!Other than the fact that there were no middle-stage venerable sovereigns, it was not much worse than some weak middle-level worlds.This was in line with the scale of a medium-sized world.Of course, with the existence of the great path universe, the Silver Moon was actually the foundation of a great world. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to become a great world."I hope I can meet the Silvermoon world!"Li Hao was looking forward to it. "A middle-level world? this is amazing ..."The referee laughed,'it's not just one medium-level world! In order to deal with the new martial arts and to balance them, the red moon has offered a higher price. A medium world is only one of the benefits. There are many other benefits, and even ... You can join the great path universe of a great world!"She was a little envious."The great world doesn't recruit venerable sovereigns at will. Under normal circumstances, a great world can only accommodate a hundred venerable sovereigns at most! However, there are no shortage of small worlds and medium worlds in the chaos. Many venerable sovereigns can only walk the chaotic Dao of chaos. Many people are willing to join a great world, and a level eight great world at that!"Unfortunately, the opportunity was very rare. A medium venerable sovereign might still be reserved. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  However, for beginner-level venerable sovereigns, joining a great world was the key to entering the intermediate-level.It was too difficult to count on himself.Li Hao nodded. That was true.How many venerable sovereigns would there be in one Tian Fang?There were definitely more than 100.In fact, there were far more than 100.How many venerable sovereigns were there in the Huilong temple?Most of them were independent cultivators. It was extremely difficult to make progress when they reached the venerable sovereign level. It was difficult to become an advanced venerable sovereign after joining a great world, but it was much easier to become an intermediate venerable sovereign, at least much easier than now.Therefore, a great Dao universe was also the key to recruiting people.Silver Moon had the capital to do so.However ... Li Hao wasn't too interested. The master of the great Dao hadn't become a venerable sovereign yet. Be careful not to be taken over by others and snatch your great Dao universe. That would be like sending food to your door.Moreover, Li Hao's plan was to give Silver moon's local powerhouses as many opportunities as possible.Even if the great Dao universe had grown, he hoped that the Silvermoon people would be able to fill in these gaps.And not an outsider! Moreover, in Li Hao's opinion, the potential of the dual-Dao universe was great. According to his previous estimation, the Dao universe could accommodate 360 venerable sovereigns when it grew ... Provided that the Dao universe was strong enough.At that moment, venerable sovereign Ming Hao, who was in front, suddenly transmitted a message.""Haoyue, you've just advanced to venerable sovereign. You should just observe the battle. As for the battle ... Try to stay out of it!"Li Hao smiled and said,"thank you for taking care of me, senior!" However, don't worry, senior. If I really do die in battle, as long as I'm not killed by someone else, fellow Daoist kongji definitely won't cause any trouble for you. Fellow Daoist kongji isn't an obstacle to you, but rather a helping hand ... At a critical moment, it's not impossible for us to borrow the name of the divine light plane. Fellow Daoist kongji is quite easy to talk to, so there won't be any problems. "Bullshit!Everyone cursed.Borrow, my ass!In a level 8 great world, you might be hacked to death if you use another person's name.Easy to talk to?Was it easy to talk to Kong Ji?He wasn't easy to talk to at all. He had ignored them before and was very arrogant ... Of course, he didn't understand before, but now he did. The Crown Prince of a level 8 world was naturally arrogant.

Furthermore, he was a powerhouse of the fifth step.Ming Hao knew a little more. It was said that this person had reached the fifth level many years ago. Now, he actually stopped cultivating the power of light and was still at the fifth level ... This was the most terrifying.Previously, he had thought that he could wrestle with the other party.Now, he was very clear that if the other party was real and still at the fifth step ... Then it would be different. After being crippled of the power of light, was he still at the fifth step?He already has the strength of the sixth step!He didn't say anything. He had to establish his prestige in front of the other venerable sovereigns. He couldn't make it too obvious just because Li Hao had a backer, but it was necessary to take care of him appropriately! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Thus, he even slowed down a bit to take care of Li Hao.He felt that Li Hao, who had just advanced to venerable sovereign, was too fast for him to keep up.For experts of their level, they could only travel by themselves. As for divine weapons ... They were not enough for venerable sovereigns. Even if they could use them, they would not be used for traveling but to kill.Weapons capable of traveling through the primordial chaos were all treasures.Who would be willing to waste it like this?Even though the group of venerable sovereigns had slowed down, they were still not slow.Last time, it took Li Hao and the others about a month to travel from Silver moon's original location to Tian Fang. This time, without the world dragging them down, the group of venerable sovereigns only took less than twenty days before Li Hao saw a familiar scene.He had arrived at the place where Silvermoon had once stood!In the blink of an eye, more than a year had passed. After chaos emerged, Li Hao felt that time had passed very quickly. He was now 24 years old, right?Unifying the entire Silver Moon had actually taken less than two years.However, after leaving Silver Moon, he had achieved nothing. He had spent more than a year there. Li Hao sighed. Back then, in Silver Moon, a year was enough for him to do a lot of things. Now, in a year, he had only advanced from Tier 1 to Tier 3. He had done nothing serious!It was no wonder that a figure like the neo martial human King had made rapid progress in the yin-yang world. In the chaos, he had only advanced from the sixth rank to the peak of the seventh rank after a thousand years.A thousand years, how long.'If I don't cause trouble or fight, it'll be hard for me to reach Level Seven in a thousand years, right?'As Li Hao thought about it, he thought of chess ... With this, I really have a chance. Even if I don't fight, I should still be able to reach Level Seven in a thousand years.As he hurried along with the crowd, he sensed the strength of another star in the river.It was also a life and death Star.Lin Hongyu 's.He used this to determine the distance between the two sides. He knew that they were approaching the Silver Moon. Because of the aura of this star, his senses were getting stronger and stronger. It was clear that the Silver Moon world was indeed heading towards celestial pole and the others.……At the same time. In the chaos.On a flying ship.Tian Ji had nothing to live for.I can feel it!'I can feel my clone approaching me. It's getting closer and closer. What the hell? why are you looking for me?'We're one family, we're one.'I know you, you know me, and since you know ... Why the hell did you get close to me? are you still my clone?'Were you forced to?The new king of the Silver Moon forced my clone?Otherwise ... You shouldn't have come so close to me!How troublesome!King Huai saw that he had nothing to live for and knew the situation. At this moment, he also sighed, "Don't worry,",m Other than saying this, what else could he do?Heaven's Fate rolled his eyes but did not say anything. 'I can't do anything about it either. At this point ... If we really run into Silver Moon, it'll take at most three months, at least two months. As long as there are no accidents, it'll only take a year or less before we meet again!'He had originally planned to wait for three to five years.Because the other party was running, and I was chasing.However ... The other party had stopped running and was now facing me. This time was instantly reduced by half, and I even felt like dying.Of course, even though he thought about it and scolded her, he still had to make preparations.He sighed."If I'm not wrong, Silver Moon has seized the body of a Beast of Chaos and should be in it now ... This is good news. It means that he can move freely. Otherwise, it's a small world. Unless we swallow it, it's not easy to take it away. We can still do it now!""In addition, I've encountered Silver Moon ... Silver Moon came to find me of his own accord, and my clone came as well. This means that they are in danger. There must be someone after them, but they shouldn't be too strong. It's not a middle-stage venerable sovereign, or they would have caught up to them long ago. It could be a second or third-stage venerable sovereign. I don't know how many of them there are.""Third, if we meet again ... It might be within the Crimson Moon world ... That's the key!"Celestial pole frowned slightly."I'm not the king of humans. I can't be unscrupulous. I can't learn from him and treat the chaos as my home. I can walk around randomly, avoid some Crimson moons, and go to the edge! Otherwise, with the Crimson Moon calling for the universe to cover it...The other party will easily come and kill us!"King Huai nodded. There was nothing wrong with this arrangement.The celestial pole Prince is the celestial pole Prince. He thought about everything. Although I thought about it, I didn't say it.Celestial pole glanced at him and continued,""The other party has taken the beast of primordial chaos ... It could be a possession, a possession by heaven's will? Or was it similar to the heavenly will's possession? No matter what, the other side already has a venerable sovereign. With the addition of the Silver Moon King, the Silver Moon King will definitely not possess the Beast of Chaos. With my avatar, it means that there may be three venerable sovereigns on the other side!""Including you and me, there are five venerable sovereigns. However, those three ... Including my clone, I can only say that they may all be first level venerable sovereigns. You are second level, and I am third level ... With this strength, it's fine if we encounter some low-level venerable sovereigns, but if we encounter a fourth level venerable sovereign, we will be in trouble!"

"Do you have any hope of advancing to the fourth rank after fusing with your clone?" King Huai asked."It won't be that easy!""No!" Heaven's Fate shook his head."Rank four isn't that simple!"He then continued,"the speed of our flying ship is quite fast. It has the speed of a middle-stage venerable sovereign. As long as we can think of a way to bring Silver Moon over and take him away, it will be difficult for a middle-stage venerable sovereign to catch up with us. I'm talking about fourth or fifth-stage venerable sovereigns. Sixth-stage venerable sovereigns will definitely be able to catch up with us!"King Huai sighed,"the road ahead is difficult!" The return journey is also a big problem ... I don't recommend going back to neo martial directly. Moreover, it's hard to say where neo martial is now. Emperor Cang is always on the move. I think ... After we pick up Silver Moon, we still have to run to the heavenly square region! There are many itinerant cultivators there and it's more chaotic. I heard that there's some friction between the radiance world and the cloud world. Besides, the celestial world is also chaotic with many venerable sovereigns. It's better to escape there!""The target is bigger!""Let's do this first," Heaven's Fate said after some thought."We'll discuss it again when we meet the Silvermoon King. I wonder what he's planning to do now."King Huai kept nodding.Heaven's Fate couldn't help but ask,"what about you?" Do you have any other thoughts?"King Huai smiled."It's up to you to decide, senior. I'm just accompanying you on this trip."Heaven's Fate rolled his eyes.Go to hell!This guy was a sinister villain. He definitely had his own ideas."Just say it ... Our lives are at stake here. Do you think I won't care about my life just because you said something bad?"That's right.He had to be more cautious with other neo martial Supreme emperors, but with this one ... He could be more appropriate. King Huai said in a low voice,""Senior, what I mean is that we still have to save ourselves!"Nonsense!King Huai continued,"we might be targeted now. We're too big a target. It's hard to even save ourselves!" I have an idea ... It's very likely that the Silver Moon has developed a new Dao ..."Heaven's Fate looked at him. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Why would he have such a thought?King Huai didn't explain or say much. If there was no new Dao, how the hell did your clone advance to venerable sovereign?There was definitely a large amount of great Dao power surging in!Furthermore, without the birth of a new Dao, how could the new king of Silvermoon possess the body of a Chaos Beast? he was much stronger than a first stage venerable sovereign. If it was heaven's will, the Heaven's Will here was actually comparable to a first stage venerable sovereign or even stronger ... This was not normal.In any case, the possibility of a new Dao being born was still very high."Our neo martial arts origin aura is too strong now ... It's not easy to Dodge!"King Huai sent a voice transmission,"the aura of the great world is too dense. This isn't good. It's too dangerous!" If we really do encounter Silvermoon and the danger is too great, what I mean is ... We can't be at the front. If a new Dao is born, we ... Should fuse it!"Celestial pole breath!F * ck!You want to betray neo martial?"Cough cough ... Senior, please don't misunderstand. The new martial artists, Silver Moon King, are from the same family. What I mean is ... If that Silver Moon King is the new master of the great Dao, it would be difficult for him to die. As for us, a Tier 3 and a Tier 2, if we fuse into the new Dao ... Hehe, the other party's strength will instantly increase, and he will definitely become even stronger. We can defeat some experts in one fell swoop, and the two of us ... Can also have an explanation!"After saying this, he transmitted his voice again."The new Dao will definitely have very few experts now. The two of us didn't do well in the origin. After entering the new Dao universe ... We might be able to become senior venerable sovereigns. When the new Dao universe rises, the two of us might be able to become intermediate-level ... If we're lucky, it's not impossible to become advanced-level!"King Huai smiled meaningfully,"if you join another macro world, you'll be a traitor!" If we join Silver Moon ... That's not the case. The new martial artist Silver Moon doesn't want to separate from us, and the situation is forcing us to do so. What do you think, senior?"Heaven's Fate took a deep breath.F * ck!That made sense.If you joined another great world, it didn't matter if they would give you a bonus or not. Even if they did, you wouldn't dare to. Weren't you afraid that the Supreme-being and human King would hammer you to death?One hundred percent!However, joining Silver Moon ... Since ancient times, Silver Moon has been my neo martial's territory ... Well, there's nothing wrong with that!This was the territory of the sword venerable.That made sense!Most importantly ... There was no need for him to do anything. Once his great Dao merged, if silver Moon really had a new Dao universe, the strength of the Masters of great Dao would definitely increase greatly. After all, they were two venerable sovereigns!Moreover, one was at the third stage, and the other was at the second stage. The strength of this master of the great Dao had skyrocketed, so wouldn't he go out and kill his opponent directly?Even if they couldn 't, the other party had found a way to escape!At that time, as a senior venerable sovereign of Silver Moon, even if he lay flat, it would not be difficult for him to become a middle-stage venerable sovereign in the new Dao universe, right? Next time ... I mean, countless years from now, if there's a chance like silver Moon again, I might be able to lie down and become a high-level venerable sovereign.The prerequisite was that they had to have good eyes and the new king of the Silver Moon had to be strong."I have to see!""Let's see the situation and the new king's abilities. We can't just lie down!"Heaven's Fate said. Even if I want to lie down, it depends on the person. If it's a good-for-nothing ... Will you lie down too?"King Huai nodded!Yes, he definitely had to.However, the other party was able to become the new king of Silver Moon, and it was even a world under the jurisdiction of neo martial artists. There was also a group of neo martial artists. To be able to unify Silver Moon was actually not simple. The key was that he dared to let his celestial pole clone become a sovereign, which was even more extraordinary.Anyway, at this moment, he felt that he could lie down for a while.If the situation was similar, he would have to lie flat.It was better to choose than to work hard.If the choice was good, then what was the point of working hard?As long as he made the right choice, he would win!At this moment, the two of them looked at each other, and celestial pole looked at him. The two of them smiled. Let's do it!In any case, he had made a decision in general.As long as the opportunity was right, not only would he not need to fight, but he would also be able to leave a good impression on the Silver Moon King. After that, he would be able to lay down on the ground for another generation, and the Silver Moon King wouldn't find it inappropriate.At this moment, Heaven's Fate, who was originally a little reluctant and unwilling to meet, was looking forward to it.He also sighed in his heart. King Huai was the one who dared to think.I didn't even dare to think that way!Sure enough, he had made the right decision to set off with King Huai this time. This guy was extremely bold at such a critical moment.No one else in neo martial could think of this idea except King Huai.After all, they were a second rank venerable sovereign and a third rank venerable sovereign. They were not ordinary cultivators, so lying down was not a choice that ordinary people could make."I'll speed up ... And try to meet him within two months!"The celestial pole gained some power. Accelerate!This was to prevent more people from coming as time dragged on.The ship sped toward the Silver Moon at an even faster speed.……At the same time.The Heaven's Fate clone was also puzzled. How did it become faster?Doesn't the main body know my situation?So fast, are you in a hurry to die!'Who are we? you're traveling so fast. If you're not here to die ... It's unlikely. Otherwise ... Do I have a way to deal with the crisis?'This time, the avatars were much more at ease.It's fine. If he doesn't come soon, I'm going to be finished. In my life, I've had the most battles recently. I've fought three to five venerable sovereigns. For him, who has always been determined to lie down and never stand, it's simply torture!At this moment, the celestial pole clone also spoke,"Black Panther, hurry up. My main body is here to receive us. Once my main body is here, the danger will be resolved!"When everyone heard this, they were instantly excited.It seemed that the celestial pole was very confident in his original body. That's right, the venerable sovereign of new martial arts still had some skills!,m Only Zhang an was a little confused.Heaven's Fate ... Why are you in such a hurry? aren't you afraid that your true body will die Here?Could it be that after not seeing each other for more than 50 years, Heaven's Fate had become more daring?If that was the case ... It was not bad.Perhaps, in the past few decades, because of the battles, the celestial pole clone had become stronger. It might have even reached level four. More than 50 years ago, the other party should have been a level two venerable sovereign. In any case, he was not the weakest venerable sovereign.At this moment, Zhang an also felt a little more at ease.Li Hao had yet to return, and silver moon's whereabouts had been exposed. He had been rather nervous recently, but he felt a little more at ease now that he had the celestial pole.

Chapter 2713 The Rules (1)
The chaosverse.The group traveled through the primordial chaos, and time passed very quickly. Most of the time, they were quietly hurrying along the way, and they did not communicate much.To venerable sovereigns, chaos was just like that. It was lonely, dead, and boring.The various worlds were the places where they could relax and have fun.They chose to wander the chaos in search of all kinds of opportunities. In fact, none of the venerable sovereigns had given up on the path of cultivation. Otherwise, they could have been the Kings of a small world and enjoyed their lives.In fact, Li Hao had been full of malice toward the chaos Rangers.Moreover, this group of people wanted to hunt for neo martial artists.After walking for a while, Li Hao discovered that these chaos Rangers and venerable sovereigns were actually on the same path.They didn't choose to give up, didn't choose to lie flat, didn't choose to retire in the small world ...They wandered in the dull chaos and seized every opportunity to become stronger.It was extremely dangerous to hunt a neo martial artist, but venerable sovereigns were willing to take the risk ... Wasn't it just for that little bit of resources?No one could deny their hard work!It could only be said that the two sides stood from different perspectives and had different standpoints. If Li Hao didn't know a neo martial artist, didn't have so many opportunities, and lacked training resources, would he have become a Ranger now?Would they take the risk to hunt down their opponents for the reward of a large world?Perhaps ... He would.This was because this was survival, this was the path of seeking Dao.Killing had never been his goal.In fact, these venerable sovereigns did not kill for the sake of killing, but for resources and to strengthen themselves.Of course, since this group of people had chosen this path, they deserved to die.To kill others for one's own resources ... It was not righteous or heroic. It could only be considered as seeking survival, survival, and Dao. It did not mean that killing others for resources was right.Life and death were determined by fate!Moving with these unaffiliated cultivators, Li Hao seemed to have understood something. He had seen through the essence of chaos, or the essence of cultivation ... It was a bloody essence that no one was willing to admit, but it was a fact.There was only one word in the whole article: "the weak are prey to the strong."To be more direct, man eating man!Everyone was the same.The big world was merging with the small world. Rank eight venerable sovereigns wanted to kill rank seven venerable sovereigns, and rank seven venerable sovereigns wanted to kill rank six venerable sovereigns. Rank six venerable sovereigns were also trying to enter rank seven and become the Overlord, swallowing other forces.Although chaosworlds were very far apart, the battles between them, both in the light and in the dark, continued.It had never been cut off!This ... Was the martial world. Where there were people, there would be rivers and lakes. Where there were living creatures, there would be rivers and lakes.Silver Moon was a small underworld, while chaos was a big underworld.What was the difference between venerable sovereigns and martial masters?No, there wasn 't.At this point, they still couldn't escape from fame and fortune ... Of course, to them, fame and fortune were different. Perhaps it was stronger strength, higher authority, more resources. In short, it was still the same.Even at the venerable sovereign level, it was still the same. They couldn't escape these things.It was completely different from the freedom he had imagined.Everyone was struggling.……Hence.At this moment, Li Hao asked a rather stupid question while he was chatting with the referee."F * ck, can't the chaos be peaceful?"This question made the referee a little dazed.She glanced at Li Hao and suddenly felt that ... This person in front of her was very childish.Was he too young?Peace?She pondered for a long time before she replied,""We don't have the final say! "Take the Hongyue region for example. The battle between new martial arts and the Hongyue region has swept everywhere. The entire Hongyue region has been involved. The great worlds are being destroyed, and so are the worlds within the small worlds. Venerable sovereigns are just cannon fodder here.""We weaklings want peace ... But who will give us the chance?" She laughed at herself,"Haoyue, you're too young!" Why would we wander around the chaos? Wasn't it all because ... He didn't have the strength? "We might be the Lords of small worlds, or the venerable sovereigns of Middle Worlds ... No matter what, once the great worlds start a war, we'll be cannon fodder! Once a high-level venerable sovereign got angry, our world would be destroyed! We can't fight back, we can't fight back ... We can only passively endure all of this!"She looked at Li Hao."Many of us didn't want this to happen. We didn't want to wander in the void and the dry chaos. We are venerable sovereigns!"She was a little proud and a little self-abased, and it was hard to understand her complicated emotions. She laughed at herself."But so what if you're a venerable sovereign? In the red moon zone, several great worlds have been destroyed and venerable sovereigns have fallen like rain ... Are you wrong to say that The Dark World and the Elysian world are here?" Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Li Hao was silent.The referee continued,"in fact, everyone knows that neo martial is eliminating some of the Crimson Moon world's helpers. Whether it's bliss or dark, they're all involved with Crimson Moon ... If Crimson Moon had not invaded neo martial, this would not have happened. Is Crimson Moon the source of the problem?"Neo martial had destroyed several worlds, and the reason was to resist the Crimson Moon.So, it was the red moon's fault?Li Hao thought, yes, wasn't it Hong Yue's fault?Ke yi added,"some people might think so ... But the tianfang region is near the Redmoon region. The tianfang region, radiance world, and cloud world are all ambitious and want to become a level nine world. If the Redmoon doesn't invade, these two worlds will invade the Redmoon once the winner is decided. The Redmoon is actually protecting itself."

Chapter 2714 The Rules (2)
Li Hao was stunned."Then the fault lies with the light and the clouds?" Yi asked again.Li Hao didn't say anything."Also not!"Yi shook his head again."It's the entire chaos that is like this! If you don't become stronger, you might disappear! There are other level 8 worlds near the tianfang region that want to become level 9. If you don't want to, aren't you just waiting for death?""That's why ... It's hard to say who's right or wrong. In the entire chaos, there's only one truth. The bigger fist is the truth!"He then added,"actually, it might have something to do with tianfang's disappearance. When tianfang world was still around, it was a rank nine world. As a rank nine venerable sovereign, tianfang had a certain degree of ruling power. At that time, the regions around it were much more peaceful.""We're all venerable sovereigns, and we're all from worlds ... We should understand that when an area no longer has an Overlord, everyone wants to be the Overlord! "However, if there is an Overlord, it will be peaceful and quiet until the Overlord is defeated ..."Almost all of these venerable sovereigns came from the world, and who wasn't an Overlord?Who didn't know this? Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  In fact, they all knew!However, what was the use of knowing?Li Hao nodded and said,"why don't the Dominators of the major domains make some relatively peaceful treaties to keep each other in check? it's not a good thing to be in too much turmoil now. For the entire chaos ... Sooner or later, a large number of venerable sovereigns will die in such turmoil.""Who's going to lead?"Yi shook his head again."The problem in chaos is that the area is too large. The distance between One World and another world is too far. Even if we reach an agreement, some people won't listen and continue to invade other worlds. When you go to stop them, the other world has already been destroyed. Can you do it for the sake of the destroyed world?""Second, there is no absolute Overlord. There are too many feudal vassals now. Of course, level eight venerable sovereigns are top experts, but some Level Seven venerable sovereigns control great worlds and great path universes. They don't think they are weaker than level eight. Who listens to who?""Third, the problem of resources!"She looked at Li Hao and said,'at the venerable sovereign level, cultivation resources are too rare! However, even if it was a Dao universe, it was not infinite in power. There was an infinite amount of energy, and there was an infinite amount of Dao. There would be a problem ... There was a limit to the number of venerable sovereigns. When the venerable sovereigns are full, no one else in the great world can become a venerable sovereign. When there are too many venerable sovereigns, there are not enough great DAOs ...""At this time, if you don't open up a battlefield, consume the number of venerable sovereigns, or devour other great Dao universes, your world ... Will decay sooner or later!"She was very serious about this."Even in an eighth-rank macro world, the number of venerable sovereigns is limited. A seventh-rank macro world can accommodate about 100 venerable sovereigns. There are slightly more eighth-rank ones, around 100 to 200." But a world with trillions and trillions of lifeforms ... And that's only one generation. For ordinary people, even if a new generation comes every 50 years, do you know how long the chaos has existed?"A venerable sovereign didn't just mean that he had risen from a single era.The other party might have dominated for countless eras.It might seem like there were only a hundred billion living beings, but in fact, after dozens of eras and trillions of living beings, only one venerable sovereign could be born.When the venerable sovereigns were full, what would happen to the remaining creatures? There was no hope!The great Dao universe had been occupied, and there were no more seats. No one had a chance later on.Li Hao once heard from Shi Gu that the red moon's venerable sovereign was actually full and could not give birth to a new one.Then what should he do?Invasion!The red moon chose to maintain her desire and continue to invade to strengthen her own Dao universe. In this way, the Dao universe would become stronger and could accommodate more venerable sovereigns.Otherwise, there would be no hope for the latecomers!This wasn't just a problem of the world, it was a problem of the entire chaos.And so, in the chaos, war was constant.On one hand, it was to get rid of some weak and useless venerable sovereigns. On the other hand, it was to make room for the future generations. Since you couldn't make it, you should give up the position of venerable sovereign to someone else!Under such circumstances, how could they stop the war?Li Hao listened carefully.In his heart, he also agreed.Yes, there were too many problems. That was why war was inevitable. Even in the chaos, it was unavoidable. In fact, it was the same in Silver Moon. If there were more people and more powerhouses, there would be insufficient positions and resources. What could they do then?,m War!It was the same everywhere in the world."There are countless Primal Chaos emperors. Has no one ever thought of a solution?""Of course!""Many worlds have actually taken some measures," Yi said."For example, the destruction of martial arts, the destruction of worlds to create a new civilization, the creation of heavenly tribulations ... All of these are to reduce the number of cultivators!""In some worlds, if there is more than one venerable sovereign, there may be Wars between them ... In fact, it is also to reduce the population of cultivators.""There are also those who don't follow the path of the cultivator civilization at all. They walk the path of technology and ordinary civilization, wiping the entire cultivation civilization from the long river of history. However, all of this is only treating the symptoms and not the root cause!""You've completely given up on the cultivation civilization ... That won't do! Once it's invaded, even you won't be able to resist!""If you give up, you won't be able to give birth to new experts. There won't be any new talents. Once you're invaded ... You won't even have any reserves and will be destroyed very quickly.

Chapter 2715 The Rules (3)
If you don't give up ... You'll have to face the problem of resource exhaustion. As a result, many venerable sovereigns had no choice but to give up their own worlds. They either devoured them or allowed the worlds to develop freely. They left and chose to wander in the chaos. As a result, many more chaos wandered in the chaos.This was the origin of the chaos Wanderer. These people might have lost in the competition because small and medium-sized worlds could not accommodate too many venerable sovereigns. They could only choose to leave after losing. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  While Yi was talking, the other venerable sovereigns were also listening quietly.Chan Xiu, the second level venerable sovereign who had not spoken much, suddenly took the initiative to speak,""Daoist Hao Yue, you're still young. Perhaps you're the only venerable sovereign in your world ... So you can't understand this feeling yet! "At first, you might not care, but after a thousand years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years ... You have not made any progress for such a long time. Your world can no longer give birth to venerable sovereigns or strong cultivators ... You have enjoyed everything you should have enjoyed and experienced everything you should have. Your family, your friends, and all your acquaintances have disappeared from the world as time passed ..."That kind of loneliness, helplessness, and loneliness would make even a venerable sovereign go crazy."When that time comes, you'll have to fight for it even if you don't want to!"Chan Xiu sighed."At this time, you can either walk out of the world and participate in the battle, or wait for the day when your world is discovered by an expert ... You can either take it in, devour it, or destroy it!"Li Hao scratched his head slightly. At this moment, he seemed very childish and young.In fact, he was too young compared to these people.Li Hao nodded."That's true. Although I haven't experienced it yet, I can more or less feel it. It's the problem of the entire chaos, not an individual. Therefore ... The chaos is actually the same as the world. It's full of deception and competition. I used to think that the venerable sovereigns in the chaos were all unrestrained and talked about the world, but I later found out that it was not the case at all! Instead, it's filled with the secular world ... It's a little different from the venerable sovereigns I imagined. Now, I can somewhat understand. "The other venerable sovereigns also smiled.Who didn't think so at the beginning?But reality will teach you how to be a person.Li Hao, on the other hand, was a little childish."I think the key to a problem lies in lifespan!" He said.Everyone looked at him."If the laws of the chaosverse are truly perfect," Li Hao explained,"I think that there should be a limit to the lifespans of experts. There are too many experts now, and their lifespans are endless! A venerable sovereign waiting to die of old age ... Would it take a million years?""I think that the key to all of this is the long lifespan! The lifespan of venerable sovereigns ... Including cultivators, should be limited! For example, the limit for those below venerable sovereigns is ten thousand years, and for venerable sovereigns, a hundred thousand years is the limit ... When the time comes, they'll die of old age ... A hundred thousand years is actually enough to enjoy. "Everyone was stunned. At this moment, even the leader of the group, Ming Hao, laughed."Then what do we want after cultivating our entire lives? Wasn't it just for immortality? In the end, even venerable sovereigns were restricted, so what was the point of cultivating? Besides ... Who can restrict venerable sovereigns?"Venerable sovereigns were the rulers of chaos.Venerable sovereigns had limited lifespans ... What was the point of playing then? Li Hao, however, was deep in thought,'for ordinary people, a hundred years is already considered an old age! Venerable sovereigns lived for 100000 years ... Under normal circumstances, if venerable sovereigns were successful in proving their Dao, 10000 years should be enough, right? After vindicating your Dao as a venerable sovereign, you can live for another 90000 years ... Isn't that long enough?"He felt that it was about time.Various problems had appeared in the chaos. The key was that, with the accumulation of generations, a large number of old experts had occupied high positions and the venerable sovereign fruit position, causing the future generations to have no hope.This resulted in a lack of resources and a lack of status. There was no hope for the people who came later. There was no way. The people in front could not improve again. They could only sit here and wait for death."Hahaha!"Ming Hao laughed again,"you're right, but ... Who can restrict a venerable sovereign?" They couldn't let venerable sovereigns commit suicide when they were old enough, could they? To be honest, it's quite boring to live too long!"Li Hao nodded and said,"that's right!" I think it's normal for them to die of old age and illness, but the chaosverse has almost no limit to the lifespan of venerable sovereigns ... I've never seen a venerable sovereign die of old age!"Everyone was stunned.What a big tone!The Laws of Chaos were incomplete?This guy's tone was really big!How big was the chaos?So big that you can't imagine it!It was so big that none of the venerable sovereigns had actually walked through the entire chaos. They only moved around in the surrounding regions. Some venerable sovereigns had even stayed in a region for their entire lives and had never gone out.There were even some who had never even left the world.Who could rule over the entire chaos?Who could make such rules for the entire chaos?Ming Hao was a fourth level venerable sovereign, and he suddenly laughed,""If the chaos really has such rules ... Isn't it unfair to venerable sovereigns? I've been cultivating for so many years, but I've been running around for my lifespan. Don't you think it's unfair? Isn't cultivation for freedom?"Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded, that's true! However ... Freedom is also relative. Freedom without any restraints, I think it's a kind of indulgence! Unless one can completely control themselves, I feel that everyone needs to be restrained by some rules! Even for myself, I think I can control myself, but ... Sometimes, I can 't. For example, when I see a bad person, I want to kill him ... But you killed someone else, is that considered a bad person?"

Chapter 2716 The Rules (4)
Li Hao said something that the venerable sovereigns thought was unreasonable.Everyone laughed and didn't say anything.How naive!He was still too young.It was fine to chat with this fellow, but if he were to take it seriously ... There would be no meaning to it.Li Hao, however, took it seriously.He was also thinking ... Whether the current chaos was too chaotic and too dark. The current chaos did not meet his expectations for the freedom of the great Dao.Of course, a limited lifespan was not the root of the problem.With a limited lifespan, powerhouses would use all means to advance.Therefore, there should also be corresponding punishment measures.Set the corresponding rules.In this way, their lifespans were limited, and the old experts would die, while the new generations would still have a chance. Even if they competed, it would be limited to a certain reasonable range.Other than these, he should also deepen his comprehension of Dao.It couldn't be upgraded just by devouring.Otherwise ... They would all be fighting and devouring each other. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  The great Dao universes devoured each other and could strengthen each other. This was also a key factor in pushing for the war.Cultivators should focus on themselves.Of course, fighting was in nature and couldn't be killed. Otherwise, cultivators would become wood, and that would be meaningless."The natural laws of the primordial chaos ..."Li Hao thought that the entire chaos should have a basic rule.Within this Basic Law, the key was to reduce the number of fights and allow cultivators to pursue the improvement of their own realms.The creation of the Laws of Chaos ...It was too terrifying and unimaginable.The next moment, he suddenly thought of someone, the master of Tian Fang.A ninth rank venerable sovereign!A space Monarch!According to Li Hao's understanding, Dao Masters were people who had reached the pinnacle of their path. In the eyes of the sky square Supreme Emperor, they were at least level eight or nine.Life and death, yin and yang, five elements ...To think that all of these Dao Masters would gather together and even try to find Shi Guang ...What were they doing?Li Hao's heart moved.What was he doing?Establish the rules?The laws of the entire chaos?Was that even possible? At this moment, Li Hao suddenly had an idea.In the next moment, he thought of something else. In fact, there were certain laws in the chaos. For example, the chaos lightning tribulation would destroy things that shouldn't exist. Could the chaos lightning tribulation be considered a law? How did this lightning tribulation come about?Where was it born?What was the standard of judgment?For a moment, Li Hao was in a daze.He was only a third rank venerable sovereign. In fact, these things were too far away from him. He should not have thought about these messy things. However, he had killed many venerable sovereigns these days. Now, a large number of venerable sovereigns in the red moon region had begun to die.War seemed to be sweeping through the entire chaos.Cultivators 'minds were filled with killing people and snatching their treasures ... Even Li Hao himself had the same thoughts. It was inevitable that he would think that the great Dao was natural and that the great Dao was not accomplished. It was all nonsense.Some people wanted to do this, some people were forced to do this, some people went with the flow, some people did it because they felt it was a loss not to do it ...The key was that it lacked some restraints.If I do something bad here, I'll just run to another place.If I kill someone here, I'll go to another world, another domain. The chaos is so big, can you still find me?The entire primordial chaos was simply too vast.It was rare for one to travel for a few months. A few years would be common, a few decades or centuries would be common. If one were to get lost, one would end up wandering the primordial chaos for countless years without even knowing what happened.At this moment, Li Hao was thinking about these things.At this time, he actually didn't have the ability to change anything. He just felt that ... The current chaos was not quite the same as the chaos he had expected. The path of cultivation for cultivators was also not quite the same as what he had imagined.While chatting with these venerable sovereigns, he had some more thoughts in his mind.Silver moon's martial masters were actually a group of free men.The pursuit of martial arts!Murder and arson were actually also done.However, Silver Moon was not thrown into chaos because of this. Why?This was because there were still some restrictions!The restraints of the law, the restraints of morality, and the restraint of not being able to run amok and be punished by others.In addition, martial masters didn't have long lifespans.Even if you were to run amuck for a lifetime, it would take at most a hundred years, at least a few years ... When you grew old, you would have to die.No matter how much you run amuck, you can only run amuck for that short period of time.The speed at which they were being replaced was also very fast!It was impossible for every generation's Overlord to be an evil person. There were also good people who would give you time for peace.However, in the chaos, if an evil person became the Overlord, he could easily rule for a million years ... Could you bear it?No one could bear it!At this moment, Li Hao's thoughts were actually not of much help to his Dao. He was just thinking ... Thinking about some random things, which made it inconvenient for him to cultivate while he was walking. Moreover, he had reached the perfection of Tier 3 and did not really need to cultivate anymore.That was why he had the time and leisure to think about these things.At this time, he suddenly felt that he could perhaps have a chat with a human ... Or a cat."Senior second cat, did Zhan Tiandi ever say ... Or teach you, what to do if there are cultivators who can't be restrained? Or rather, they are all cultivators who can't be restrained. What should I do?"Second cat was sleeping and didn't care that someone was disturbing him.However, when he heard this question, he seemed to have thought of something and replied,""Then, we'll establish a rule that everyone can accept ... The premise is that you have the ability to establish it! The desires of humans were infinite. Not only humans, but the desires of living beings were also infinite! "Those who learn to control their desires are Saints, but not everyone in the world is a Saint. Thus, great power is needed to establish and maintain these rules ... There are laws in the world, but they definitely didn't exist in the first place. At that time, only morality and martial arts could restrain and suppress them. Later on, the laws gradually improved, and the first batch of people who experienced it would definitely be unable to bear it. There would definitely be some resistance, and generation after generation of people perfected, maintained, and suppressed it ... And then there were restrictions and rules!"

Chapter 2717 The Rules (Part 5)
"Then, is it correct to put the shackles of life on cultivators?"At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be talking to Zhan Tiandi.He was conversing with the powerful venerable sovereign who had been teaching and educating people his entire life."The shackles of life?"Second cat was lost in his memories again. After a long time, he said,"This is how it should be ... An endless lifespan is unfair! It doesn't matter if you're a venerable sovereign or someone else, you have an endless lifespan. In fact, it's a monopoly for the whole world and the whole society!""For example, if a venerable sovereign was born in a small world, in order to dominate and not allow others to surpass him ... How strong is a venerable sovereign? he could kill all the people who came after him and not give them any chance. He could do this for tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years!"​ "At that time, the world might not have made any progress for hundreds of thousands of years!""Actually, this is the era regressing!""Why is it that the more ancient a cultivator is, the more powerful he is? The cultivators of the new generation were unable to surpass them ... For so many years, be it the world or the chaos, ancient cultivators had occupied the dominant position. How many new cultivators ... Could rise? Except for a few weak venerable sovereigns, the powerful venerable sovereigns are almost all ancient existences ..."In fact, second cat was just retelling some of Zhan Tiandi's words.It seemed to have thought of something and continued,"In fact, the shorter one's lifespan is, the easier it is for them to explode with unimaginable brilliance, the brilliance of civilization! Mortals only have a lifespan of a hundred years, but in these hundred years, they may be able to create countless things that you can't imagine ... On the other hand, venerable sovereigns may not even think about creating something in ten thousand years!""Back then ..."At this point, second cat was a little sad,"back then, the reason why the teacher chose ... Chose to leave, was actually because of this." It was too boring. He had lived for too long. Even though he was not the oldest cultivator of that era and was considered young among the venerable sovereigns, he had done all the interesting things in the world! He found that his teacher, his friends, his teachers ... Had all changed in the endless longevity. He felt that this era was too sad and boring. It was time to leave!""If the cultivators back then had limited lifespans, the nine emperors and four Emperors of that era would have been outstanding ... When one gets old, they change! The nine sovereigns and four thearchs of the Yin Yang world ... Even the celestial Thearch was an outstanding person in the early stages. They were all heroes who saved all living things. However, because they had lived for too long, they changed. "Li Hao listened in silence.So Zhan also felt that living too long was not a good thing?Venerable sovereigns 'lifespans were almost infinite, and they were immortal. In the future, some changes would occur.Not to mention venerable sovereigns, in the Silvermoon world, after being sealed for 100000 years, didn't those new martial artists also have some changes?How many people could really maintain their original hearts over the long years?I can't either!"Time ..."Time was the scariest thing. Time could change people. Time could change people's original intentions. Time could make people decay. Time could make people rot.With life and death as the foundation, with time as the driving force, birth, aging, illness, death, life and death, reincarnation ...The rules, the rules! At this moment, Li Hao thought of many things.He didn't know why he was thinking about this. Perhaps...It was because the chaotic situation had shattered his fantasies about cultivation.Perhaps it was because he felt that he had not done anything in the past few days. Besides killing people ... Was killing really the kind of cultivation life he wanted?I actually want to see more DAOs. For example, he actually likes daoqi. If possible, he wants to continue to comprehend it.But why am I not comprehending it?"Because ... Someone is going to kill someone. To kill neo martial artists, I have to leave. I'm going to see if I can help.Silver Moon is also in danger, so I still have to leave. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Otherwise, I can stay in the Dao chess forever.He then followed this group of independent venerable sovereigns to the battlefield. These were all venerable sovereigns, fellow Daoists who he had imagined could discuss the Dao with him. Unfortunately, these people did not seem to be pursuing pure Dao. They were influenced by the environment and went to various places to participate in various Wars for the sake of some resources, regardless of right or wrong, friend or foe."The chaos ... Is too chaotic!""There are too few rules!""Humans have rules, everything has rules, even ... The world has rules! "The lifespans of worlds shouldn't be limitless. Countless worlds are being born, and if this continues, the primordial chaos will reach its limit. When that happens, the World War will begin!"Life and death are things that everyone should experience .... Even a cultivator of the Dao of life and death like me shouldn't be able to reincarnate indefinitely .... Nine times is a bit too much."Under normal circumstances, a venerable sovereign could live for a million years, and I could reincarnate once every million years, so I could live for nine million years!Nine million years ... How many generations had the mortal world gone by?I alone might be able to rule over millions of generations of mortals, even if silver moon's generation only has ten billion people ...It's hard to imagine that trillions of people rely on your breath to survive.It was too terrifying!"Haoyue, what are you thinking about?"At this moment, someone interrupted his thoughts.The referee was a little curious and confused.After just a few words, Haoyue became silent. He kept silent, as if he was thinking about something, frowning slightly. That appearance ... It was as if he was thinking about some major event in his life."Are you afraid?" the referee laughed.

Chapter 2718 The Rules (6)
"How can that be?" Li Hao was startled and smiled."You must be scared!"Yi laughed."You're too young. You probably haven't experienced many battles and rarely fought venerable sovereigns ... Tell me honestly, how old are you? I feel that you're very young. Perhaps you're so young that it's hard to imagine.""Sister Zheng, how old are you?" Li Hao smiled.Richard chuckled,"in any world, it's impolite to ask a woman about her age!" Of course, I'm still considered young among venerable sovereigns. I'm the youngest and most talented cultivator in our world. I corroborated my Dao as a venerable sovereign at three thousand years old and became a venerable sovereign two thousand years ago ... Five thousand years old. Of course, I can't compare to the people of the new martial arts ... But because it's their first time connecting with the chaos, they will return to normal in the future! Five thousand years old ... That's still considered young, right?"“……”Li Hao glanced at her, embarrassed to say something against his conscience.Five thousand years old, was he young?Lin Hongyu is about ten years older than me ... I always thought that Lin Hongyu was a little old. If we were to be engaged, it would be like an old cow eating young grass.He was only in his early 30s.You're 5000 years old ... How am I supposed to praise you for being young?"It's alright!"Li Hao smiled in embarrassment.He's really old!I didn't expect you to be five thousand years old.Of course, it was normal for a venerable sovereign to be thousands of years old.Zhang an and the others had been sealed for 100000 years, so they were more than 100000 years old now ... Of course, according to the chaotic years, they were actually not too old."How about you?""I ... I ..."Li Hao thought for a long time and then gestured with two fingers."I'm over twenty.""Two thousand years old?"The referee seemed to understand."He's indeed young!" From the beginning of cultivation to becoming a venerable sovereign, neo martial arts is a bit unique. It's closed off from the big world, so many people become venerable sovereigns at a very young age ... Under normal circumstances, one can be considered a top genius to become a venerable sovereign in two thousand years!""Of course, there are even younger ones!"Yi laughed and said,"let's talk about your friend ... The Son of God of light. If he's really that person, according to our understanding, he's only a thousand years old! It's hard to imagine that he was already a rank five venerable sovereign five hundred years ago ... To be honest, he's not much worse than a neo martial human King. "Of course, his background was too strong.His father was a level eight venerable sovereign, and he had helped him all the way to level five in 500 years ... Of course, he was also a genius, without a doubt."However, if there's no great opportunity, it's impossible to catch up with the neo martial human King. It's said that the neo martial human King became a sixth stage venerable sovereign in his twenties ... That's more terrifying!"The referee mentioned neo martial again. After all, this time it was related to neo martial. He sighed."The other party spent less than a thousand years to become a seventh level venerable sovereign, and is even advancing towards the eighth level. The neo martial world must be full of opportunities and inconceivable things. The current eighth level venerable sovereigns in the nearby regions, such as Cloud Master, Light Master, and red Moon master, are almost counted in the units of hundreds of thousands!"Li Hao was a little curious."As far as I know, the neo martial artist King's understanding of Dao is not too deep. How did he improve so quickly?"Was 1,000 years to reach level eight considered fast?Of course it counted!More importantly, the other party's comprehension of the great Dao did not seem to be too deep."This is what everyone is curious about!"Yi smiled and said,"that's why ... Red Moon took the initiative to attack neo martial!" "It's not just the neo martial human King. There's also sun god and Emperor Cang on the side of the neo martial world. They've all stepped into the seventh rank. You have to understand that under normal circumstances, it's very difficult for a macro world to produce a seventh rank. However, the other party has three!"This was even more unbelievable!Neo martial was considered a new great world. The origin universe had only been born a few years ago.If not for the fact that the celestial Thearch had been killed, perhaps the celestial Thearch would have entered tier 7.How could a world that had not been born for long give birth to so many tier 7 beings?How many years had it been since Hong Yue went from Level Seven to level eight?They only had a few rank seven venerable sovereigns!Many Level Seven venerable sovereigns were born from the destruction of great worlds. They were not like the new martial world, where a great path universe supported the birth of several Level Seven venerable sovereigns.Li Hao thought for a moment and said, neo martial world should be a dual-Dao universe! The other party calls himself the universe of origin. In my opinion, it should be yin and yang, considered a dual Dao universe. In this case, the birth of two level Seven is a guarantee. In fact, it is understandable. "In front, the fourth rank venerable sovereign turned around and laughed,""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, don't just hear rumors! What double Dao universe ... The Dao universe is the Dao universe, double Dao universe ... You mean the two Dao universes have overlapped? I've never even heard of it. "Li Hao was stunned. Never heard of it?That's impossible!Furthermore, I, Silvermoon, also have a dual Dao universe.Illusory and corporeal dual DAOs! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Silver Moon was also from neo martial, and neo martial was bound to be a dual Dao universe, a yin-yang universe. It was already so obvious, so how could it not be?The new martial human king and emperor Cang were actually the Masters of yin and yang.Li Hao had made his judgment on this.Therefore, it was actually understandable that a few rank-7s were born in neo martial arts.He frowned slightly."Dual Dao universes ... Don't they exist in the primal Chaos? Only neo martial arts?" Ming Hao laughed."You're still too young. The Dao universes, unless devoured, there will be some conflicts when they overlap ... It doesn't mean that when two Dao universes are put together, it will be a double Dao universe! DAOs were different! Therefore, there is no such thing as a dual Dao universe. It is just that the other party's Dao universe is dominated by yin and yang. This does not mean that there are two Dao universes of yin and yang. Do you understand?"Li Hao nodded, but didn't say anything.It won 't!According to his understanding, it was a dual Dao universe.It was not dominated by yin and yang!He understood neo martial. It was not a universe dominated by yin and yang, but the first yang Dao. Later, after the human King became a venerable sovereign, he discovered or opened up the yin universe and resurrected those who had died in battle.,m The two universes had not been together from the beginning.It didn't appear from the beginning.In the later stage, the neo martial human King discovered it himself and combined the yin-yang universe into one. That was how the current yin-yang world was formed.This guy didn't understand the situation and was spouting nonsense."Dual-Dao universes are not something everyone knows ... But neo martial and silver Moon are both. This is interesting!"Silver Moon also originated from neo martial.Li Hao suddenly thought of something.Tian Fang ... Was it a dual Dao universe?Tian Fang master specialized in space.Space, from its literal meaning, was not the way of the two extremes, but a simple space domain.Then, the other party's great Dao universe was also a simple universe with the Dao of space as its main force.In truth, time was not divided into two poles.However, if one were to calculate the past and the future ... It could actually be considered the path of two extremes.Was there a corresponding space?Internal and external space?Virtual space?Yin Yang space?Life and death space?Could the space be arranged in such a way?At this moment, Li Hao fell into deep thought again.Phoenix did not disturb him anymore. She had also noticed that the young man in front of her always liked to think about things. Perhaps this was the reason why he had become a venerable sovereign at such a young age.He was a young man who liked to think.Very good!She quite liked this kind of bookish young man, but ... Could this guy be a nerd?Along the way, he seemed to be thinking about too many things.This guy would easily fall into deep thought with just a few words. 'Don't be like this during a battle.' Even the referee found it hard to imagine how this guy would fight when he was in battle.Perhaps ... It was just for show?Thinking of this, the referee was a little disappointed. In fact, he didn't really hope that this young man in front of him was just for show. However, if he were to fight and kill like those boorish men, he felt that it would shatter the fantasy in his heart.What a terrible experience!Li Hao, on the other hand, was in no mood to care about this. He was indeed thinking about many things at the moment.It was a new experience for him to go out and chat with venerable sovereigns, even if they were not talking about the great Dao. Along the way, he felt that he had comprehended many things. It might not be able to improve his realm, but it was a rare life experience for him.In addition ... Silver Moon seems to be arriving soon.It was possible that a battle had broken out, or else they would have caught up to Silver Moon even though they were not fast.This shouldn't have happened!Who was going against Silver Moon?Li Hao fell into deep thought again. Also, now that I've encountered Silver Moon ... I haven't even met Heaven's Fate and the others yet, so should I make a move?Should I kill all the other 11 venerable sovereigns here after I take action?What a difficult decision!Actually, I've quite liked them along the way.Also, are there any powerful venerable sovereigns following me?Countless thoughts were born.A strand of hair fell with the wind.There's actually wind in the chaos ... Li Hao thought to himself, I can't think about it anymore. If I keep thinking about it, I'll be too embarrassed to face anyone.

Chapter 2719 A Refined Man Killing People (1)
The chaosverse. The Crimson Moon world.A giant beast was flying across the sky.Several powerhouses were floating in the air above the giant beast. At this moment, they were all nervous and gloomy.The enemy had caught up!These people had been watching them from the vicinity of Tian Fang. Up until now, they had tried to shake them off several times, but they had failed ... It was all Black Panther's fault!It was too slow.A second stage venerable sovereign, but because he had a small world in his stomach, his speed was very slow. He was not any faster than an ordinary first stage venerable sovereign.As a result, even though it was difficult to find a demon in the chaos, these guys still managed to catch up."I really hope the other party is the human King!"At this moment, the celestial pole clone was a little depressed.A human King could really get lost.It was normal to lose face after chasing.The outside world said that the human King was deliberately looking for trouble ... Sometimes, it was indeed intentional, but many times, he really did go in the wrong direction. This was something that the celestial pole was very clear about. However, it didn't matter to the human King if he went in the wrong direction.At this moment, he really wished that the group of bastards behind him were all as bad at directions as the human King.If we get lost in the primordial chaos...It'll be hard for them to find us without spending decades or even centuries.Unfortunately, it wasn 't!He turned around and frowned. There were two third level venerable sovereigns, one second level venerable sovereign, and one first level venerable sovereign.This was a group or a small gang.In the beginning, they were definitely not the only ones looking for Silver Moon, but now, there were only a few of them.Four venerable sovereigns!On Silver moon's side, only the Black Panther and the celestial pole clone were comparable to venerable sovereigns when they combined. They were only equivalent to three venerable sovereigns, and the strongest was only at rank two.Of course, the two great Dao Masters were about to become emperors.If he tried ... He might have a chance to vindicate Dao today. However, even if they succeeded, they would only have two first rank venerable sovereigns. The number of venerable sovereigns could be the same, but the difference in rank was too great. Even if they were both low-rank venerable sovereigns, a third rank venerable sovereigns were not comparable to a first rank venerable sovereign."I'm still a long way from my original body ... Maybe we'll meet again in about a month ..."To chaos, a month was not far.However, once a battle broke out, a month ... Would be too long, and they would have to complain that they were too slow to collect the corpses. There were no more corpses to collect.At that moment, Lin Hongyu and the others were also on the Black Panther's body.The experts turned around. The other party was still some distance away from them, but the venerable sovereigns had already started to split up. It seemed that they were going to block their way and trap them here.If you encountered a powerful enemy in the primordial chaos, you wouldn't even have a place to hide.Unless there happened to be a world nearby, and the world had to be powerful, and the strong people in the world were willing to protect you ... Otherwise, you would be courting death if you went to another world.Hong Yitang's expression was grave as he said in a deep voice,""Qian Wuliang and I will try to advance! After a year of accumulation, the power of his great Dao was almost there. The entire Dao universe had become stronger, so it shouldn't be too difficult to advance! After that, we'll try to combine as one. Perhaps ... We can hold off a third rank venerable sovereign!"After spending some time in the chaos and hearing about it, they knew the difference between the strong and weak venerable sovereigns. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  There were obviously two rank three venerable sovereigns behind them.It was difficult to hide too much of their auras in the chaos. Even if the two of them advanced and fused, they could stop one of them. Black Panther could use his world power. After all, it was a medium-level world. He could still deal with a rank three. The remaining rank two and rank one ... Could only be left to the Heaven's Fate!The celestial pole clone's face darkened.I'm just a clone. Although I'm at the venerable sovereign level, I'm only at the weakest stage one. I'm still confident in dealing with a stage one, but with a stage two ... Are you overestimating me?Of course, if it was his true body, there was still hope with the support of the power of a large world. The DAOs of these itinerant cultivators were a little mixed.More importantly, I'm only a clone.Right now, I'm actually no different from a loose cultivator.The other party had an additional venerable sovereign!Lin Hongyu and the others had not proven their Dao. They would not be able to defeat venerable sovereigns, not even peak half-step sovereigns.Although Lin Hongyu had walked the Dao of life and death, it was still difficult for a half-step sovereign to deal with a venerable sovereign before she reached the venerable sovereign level.It had been so many years. This year might be the most he had fought with venerable sovereigns.Celestial pole was a little depressed.His true body was too slow.He had thought that he would be safer if he met his true body, but it seemed like he might not even have the chance to meet him."Should we continue to flee, or should we stop and fight?"Hong Yitang looked at the celestial pole and then at Lin Hongyu."If we run, we'll be blocked by our opponents very quickly. We won't have time to react at all. If we stop and fight ... We won't even have the chance to escape if we don't finish off our opponents."Lin Hongyu did not say anything. She only looked into the distance.She had a vague feeling that Li Hao wasn't far from here.But ... How far was 'not far'?She didn't know and couldn't clearly judge. She wasn't the master of the river of life and death. Li Hao could sense her distance, but she could only vaguely judge Li Hao's distance and couldn't sense the specific situation.After a moment's pause, she said,"I'll go fight that first stage venerable sovereign!" "The Black Panther will use the power of the world to fight a rank three expert. The two of you, quickly advance and merge as one to fight a rank three expert. Senior Empyrean terminus ... I'll leave the remaining rank two expert to you!""Stall for time!"
