The battle between Dali and the divine Kingdom was still ongoing.Because of the appearance of the God of beginner martial, the Li Dynasty was like a hot knife through butter. They invaded the divine Kingdom and occupied a lot of territory.As for the Queen's side, they were defeated again and again.First, they lost to Heavenly Star and lost all their elites. Then, a large number of gods were killed by Li Hao. Then, they were beaten up by God Chu Wu. Now, they could only watch as their divine Kingdom was continuously invaded.Although the believers were violent and brave, they were not a regular army after all, and they were losing ground.The Dali King had few people. Along the way, he attacked cities and destroyed strongholds. In order to keep the rear in order, he killed a lot. His believers were too fanatical and difficult to deal with. In order to avoid future trouble, the king of desolation really started a large-scale massacre, and even ... Massacred the entire city!Li Hao knew all of this and even saw it with his own eyes.He didn't care.Why should we care if they are not our people?He had let Dali attack the divine Kingdom so that both sides could fight and weaken each other. After this battle, both sides would become mortal enemies. Dali had also suffered great losses, and their gains ... Other than territory, there was nothing else.What else could it be?The divine Kingdom had quite a bit of power of belief, but not much energy. The power of belief could not be randomly absorbed. People did not believe in you, so there was not much to gain from the battle.This kind of war was not what the various parties were pursuing.However, in order to make heavenstar feel at ease, the king of Dali had no choice but to launch such an attack. Even though the God of beginner martial was strong, he did not make another move after making one move.The king of Dali didn't dare to put all his hopes on that guy.He would rather become stronger to be qualified to participate in this contest and have the chance to let Dali remain independent rather than merge into Heavenly Star and become a part of it.The war was still ongoing.However, the king of Dali was already prepared to leave quietly.The ten-day period was almost up.……The great wilderness.The heavens and earth were in chaos. The last batch of residents of the great wilderness were also being moved away. After today, the great wilderness would become a forbidden land without any signs of life.Many people were actually unwilling to leave.Leaving their homes and suddenly going to the Central Plains, that unfamiliar place, where they were all strangers, the people of the vast wilderness did not want to leave.However ... He had no choice but to leave.Countless experts continued to enter the great wilderness, and even the great desolate King appeared to advise everyone to retreat quickly. If they stayed, they would only be met with death.Countless people were filled with hatred. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ He hated the desolate King, he hated Li Hao ... But Li Hao didn't care.The migration of heavenly stars was easy, and everyone had witnessed Li Hao's power.Da Huang hated him, but he didn't care about any of this.When these people entered the central region, they would forget everything a few years later.Outside the great wilderness.As Li Hao hovered in the air, more and more people gathered around him. The four Saints from the four main cities were scattered all over the world and not here.However, there were still many experts gathered here.It caused quite a commotion. In the past few days, Li Hao had been cultivating like crazy, absorbing the power of heaven and earth and the power of great DAOs. The will of heaven had been restless, as if it wanted to enter the great wilderness and destroy it."Wind, rise!"Li Hao murmured softly. The next moment, a strong wind blew, and yellow sand filled the sky.The world changed color."Cloud rise!"Dark clouds covered the sky, and the entire world instantly fell into darkness. The wind and clouds surged, and the entire great wilderness entered a semi-darkness.It covered the clouds and the sun.Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky. The moon seemed to be setting in his direction again.It was quite a commotion. Could li daoheng guess what he was doing?p Or did he just feel that he was compressing the vast wilderness?He couldn't tell if the other party knew.The Heaven's Will above his head seemed to have formed a sword!Heavenly Sword!The sword cultivators, Tian Jian, Hong Yitang, and the radiance sword all looked solemn. The will of heaven seemed to have formed a sword. Everything in this world was related to the way of the sword.The Heaven's Will that was only stirring up the wind and clouds could actually faintly form the shape of a sword. It could be seen that heaven's will had actually grown much stronger these days.And now, Li Hao was showing his determination to solve the problem of the wasteland.Most of the Heaven's Will that could be gathered in the world had gathered.If it wasn't for the fact that heaven's will didn't stake everything on this one throw, they might have given up on the others and gathered here.However, heaven's will was still scattered.Although there was a lot of heaven's will gathered here, it was not a complete heaven's will. Heaven's will was spread across the entire Heavenly Star and not just one place.Li Hao raised his head again. Through the dark clouds, he vaguely saw the bright moon.Would li daoheng make a move now to seize the Heaven's Will?Capture heaven's will?The Heaven's Will could help him improve further, allowing him to control the heavens and earth more easily, to control the great Dao more easily, and to walk out of the moon more easily. Would he do it?Li Hao didn't know.At this moment, several figures appeared in the distance.The Dali King had arrived.Not only the Dali King, but also the Empress Dowager, Jiang Li, and even the Dali King. Other than the Queen, the other three Kings of the four countries were all here.Li Hao waited in silence and didn't greet anyone.He just continued floating in the air and cultivating.Above his head, the Heaven's Will was about to condense into a sword.Within the vast wilderness, the White Horse was restless.At this moment, it could also feel the impending doom. Princess Yue tried to comfort it, but it was of little use. The will of chaos appeared on the White Horse and stirred the great wilderness as if it was going against the will of heaven."The Heaven's Will ... Once it is swallowed, it will definitely retaliate."

2201 Chapter 370
Li Hao thought to himself as he glanced at the sword above his head.This place was only a part of it.Once the Heaven's Will here was annihilated, the remaining heaven's will would definitely retaliate. Heaven's will did not have the ability to kill, so it would definitely retaliate through the hands of others.As a sky pilferer, he would be underestimating Li Hao if he didn't even know this."The Queen and Ying Hongyue, these two modern martial masters, are the easiest to obtain the blessing of heaven's will. Once I deal with the Heaven's Will, it's very likely that the Heaven's Will will will gather the two of them, allowing them to quickly control a part of the world and drive them to kill me ..."  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  At that time, he would be in control of the great wilderness, but the remaining heaven's will would probably be split between the two of them.Even though it might not be safe to gather heaven's will, it would bring great benefits to these two people for now.The corners of Li Hao's mouth rose slightly.Every time he improved, these people would benefit, especially Ying Hongyue ... These people really raised him well.Raising bandits for self-respect ... Was perhaps their current state.Many people hoped that these people would suppress them and deal with them. Therefore, every time they improved, it would be extremely difficult for others to catch up. On the other hand, Ying Hongyue and the others were rising steadily and with great ease.All the chess players in the world were using them as chess pieces. They kept putting down chess pieces to suppress Li Hao, who was trying to jump out of the chessboard.At this moment, Li Hao looked at Black Panther.Then, he took another look at the divine sword.He was thinking about a question. The Black Panther devoured the Heaven's Will. Did the Heaven's Will know that it was his idea?Heaven's will was very young, it did not have complete intelligence.Now, she was still as young as a child.If the Heaven's Will didn't know that he was the one who incited it, and the Black Panther devoured the Heaven's Will ... Then would the Heaven's Will want to kill me or the Black Panther?If he only wanted to kill the Black Panther ... Perhaps, he was also a target favored by the Heaven's Will. For the sake of revenge, perhaps he would continue to favor him and bless him with heaven's will?Of course, this was completely treating Tianyi as a fool. Once the other party had a bit of intelligence and felt that the Black Panther was in cahoots with him ... There was a high probability that they would still deal with him.However, perhaps he was really a fool?Li Hao smiled.At that moment, Lin Hongyu flew forward and transmitted her voice,""Lord Marquis, the arrangements have been made."Li Hao nodded slightly. He looked at Lin Hongyu and the others and thought for a while. Then, he sent a voice transmission,""Heaven's will is human's will, man can conquer heaven! Of course, even though he said that, it was hard to say if he could really decide the fate. If heaven's will is stupid, then there's no need for you to interfere ... If it's not stupid, I'm not putting in so much effort just to make someone else's wedding dress!""However, when that time comes ... It will probably attract the Zheng family's attention. Zheng Yu might come to cause trouble. Now, he thinks that I'm here to deal with the vast wilderness, so he doesn't care about me!""Once the other party interferes, the sages can come out. It's hard to say how many sages the other party has now. At that time, I couldn't easily enter the great path universe. I'll be in great danger!""Then ... If it really comes to that, you can just give it up. Where there's life, there's hope!" Lin Hongyu said seriously.It would be best if everything went smoothly.It would be the best result if he could successfully Steal the Sky and change the sun.However, once they offended the Heaven's Will ... Things would not go so smoothly. Even if Zheng Yu did not notice it, the Heaven's Will would let them notice it. This was the power of the Heaven's Will, guiding one to discover it."Yes, I will consider it ... Of course, let's not talk about this. At the critical moment, you must make the necessary arrangements! Perhaps, this is a battle of will against the will of the heavens ... I hope that man can win against the heavens!"Li Hao gave him a few words of advice and looked up at the sky.After thinking for a while, he transmitted his voice again,""You're now the governor of the Heavenly Star military governor's office and a leader. In fact, you're also favored by the will of the heavens ..."Lin Hongyu's eyes flickered.Li Hao pondered for a moment, then continued,"are you willing to go out?" If you give up this chance, you might have another chance, or maybe not ... Besides, the will of the heavens is stirring. The Queen might come. Even if she doesn't come, someone else might let her come. ""Lord Marquis wants me to ambush the Queen?"Lin Hongyu's eyes flickered. She was only at the seventh stage of the sun Moon tier, while the Queen was at least at the ninth stage and was at the Dao integration stage. There was still a gap between them.Moreover, he had brought a few divine spirits with him.Ambushing the other party ... Was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. It would be good enough if they were not killed by the other party."How could it be!"That would be courting death."The four main cities are going to go into a riot. They will extract the energy of heaven and earth, stir up the world, and cut off all communication ... Everyone is watching my people! However, there's a group of people that no one is watching. There's a group of students under the ruins of the Heavenly Star Town, and some of them are willing to join us!"Li Hao looked at her and said telepathically,"go back to stellarsky city and call these people. There are hundreds of students. At least a hundred of them are willing to join us. Although they're all puppets now, they still have the power of the sun and the moon!""If things go well on my end, you don't have to do anything. If things don't go well ...""The Queen is here, the Li Dynasty King is here, everyone is here ... Take the students to the West and destroy the kingdom and Li Dynasty's Army. Invade their territory and merge them into heavenstar!" The voice said.Lin Hongyu's expression changed.He glanced at the king of Dali not far away from the corner of his eye and transmitted his voice,""That God of beginner martial arts ..."

"It's fine. I'm afraid that fellow won't rashly walk out of the Li Dynasty! One attack was enough ... Of course, if he really encountered one, it was fate. He was unlucky, and there was nothing he could do! I'm only saying what if! Or just be a little more careful and expel the Li Dynasty ... And kill all of the God nation's rebels!""Seize the territory of the God Kingdom and become the Overlord of a region ... Even if the heavens do not favor you, you can establish your own faction and rebuild the city of supers ...""I don't dare!"Lin Hongyu was shocked and said hurriedly,""Lord Marquis ...""No need to say more! "I'm only talking about what if I'm really viewed as an enemy by the Heaven's Will. If you do, you can just set up your own faction and lie to the Heaven's Will. The Heaven's Will isn't that wise ... You've invaded the Western divine Kingdom, and the Queen is a piece of trash. How much of the Heaven's Will can you get? In terms of talent, you're not worse than her. She has someone who has been helping her. Although the Sequoia family is willing to help you, it can't even protect itself, so the help is limited!"Lin Hongyu's talent was definitely not much worse than the Queen 's.Of course, he was only a few years older. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  ​ Li Hao pondered for a moment. This was also a precaution. Anything was possible. Even if li daoheng was capable, he was still lacking ... There weren't many people he could use. In this era, the truly outstanding people were all on his side."Lin Hongyu, this time, either you gain nothing, or ... You gain the favor of a large number of heaven's will, and you may even gain three in a day! It's your choice. If you don't want to, I can let Qian Wuliang go. He might be happy to ..."However, Qian Wuliang was advancing too fast. Qian Wuliang had already reached Level 7!Li Hao still needed to be properly restrained.She couldn't encourage his desires, as that would only harm him.There was no need!If it was to kill Qian Wuliang, it would be a good opportunity to boost his desire. However, Li Hao still wanted to use him, so there was no need to let his ambition grow. If it were Qian Wuliang, he would have taken the initiative to attack even if nothing happened.This was not in line with Li Hao's expectations.Lin Hongyu thought quickly. She already understood what Li Hao meant. Once something happened here, the will of heaven would be hostile to Li Hao and would definitely find someone to help him. Ying Hongyue probably wouldn't dare to take it, but the Queen would dare to. However, if they lost their divine Kingdom and territory, would the will of heaven still favor them?The commotion here might be able to cover up the changes in the God nation.Moreover, the people were the puppets from the neo martial arts university of Yuanping, so there were even fewer people who paid attention to them.It was just that ... At that time, if he still used heavenstar's name, it might not be of any use. Should he establish his own sect?Many thoughts appeared in his mind."Marquis, just me ... Or should we arrange for more people?" Lin Hongyu quickly sent a voice transmission."You're alone! "If too many people leave, there will be people who will care ... Go back to stellarsky city now and start setting up the sky screen everywhere. Be careful, but there's no need to be too careful. However, you have to at least express a message ... I might use the people's will to defeat the counterattack of heaven's will! This is the backup plan I want to show the other party. " Lin Hongyu kept nodding.Li Hao was also a cautious person, so it was hard to say if he could hide it.However, if they thought that Li Hao was just stealing the sky, everyone would suffer.At this moment, Lin Hongyu felt that the Marquis was becoming more mature, calmer, and colder!Just now, he had casually killed the God nation's resists...And that would have been a land of corpses!Also, the Dali King and the other Kings were all here.Furthermore, they would all enter the great wilderness.Lin Hongyu could tell that perhaps ... This was done to deprive them of their heaven's will so that the Heaven's Will had no one to choose from and reduce the number of hidden dangers.The overlords of the various countries were also favored by the heavens.While she was thinking about this, Li Hao stopped transmitting his voice and said,""Governor Lin, you have to return to Heavenly Star this time to guard it against any turbulence! He might miss this opportunity ... But it didn't matter. It was just a small opportunity, nothing much! This time, Shanqi is the key. If Shanqi can improve, you will naturally be treated well!"Not far away, Hong Mu was shocked and hurriedly transformed into a human.""Lord Marquis must be joking. Everything was planned out by Lord Marquis ..."It was very worried that Li Hao would be dissatisfied.It had become the leader of the Yao plant Army and had many Yao plants under its command. It had also reached the level of a Saint. Lin Hongyu's status was second only to Li Hao 's, and she was the head of the five military governors!It was in cahoots with Lin Hongyu.There was one more thing ... Many people didn't mention that Qian Wuliang was actually from the city of supers. Perhaps he was forced to join Li Hao's side in the beginning because he had no other choice. But now, since he had joined, he had no foundation and was subconsciously trying to get closer to the city of supers.Lin Hongyu, Hong shanmu, and Qian Wuliang.Just these three ... Actually occupied an extremely important position.Now that Li Hao suddenly said this, how could he not be worried?As Hong shanmu was worried, Qian Wuliang's expression changed slightly. He didn't dare to look at Li Hao, but carefully glanced at Lin Hongyu. Seeing that she was calm and didn't look at him anymore, he was a little relieved.Li Hao and the Silver Moon Martial Master were more like seniors and juniors, but these people were more like seniors and juniors.Seeing Sequoia speak, Li Hao smiled and said,""Senior Suki, you've misunderstood. Helping each other is something we should do! 'It's not like we're splitting the resources evenly. The more you work, the more you get. I don't care how much you get, even if you give it all away!' Everyone was the same! "What I need to do is to give the most suitable resources to the most suitable people. Whether you use them for yourself or others ... It depends on you. If you can't keep up, you might not have a chance next time!"

After a few simple words, he looked at the Dali King and the others."Everyone, you should enter the great desolate region first!"The great li King, great desolate King, and Empress Dowager shuiyun looked at each other and didn't say anything. They all rushed towards the great wilderness.As for whether or not Li Hao wanted to kill them ... If he had such thoughts, they would have been killed long ago.This might really be an opportunity.Of course, there were gains and losses.It was not necessarily a good thing to lose the favor of the heavens.Empress Dowager Shui Yun was fine. She had taken the new martial path, but there was not much favor from the heavens.The great desolate King was even more so, as the great desolate and heaven's will were enemies.However, he was still a King after all. Now that great desolation had retreated, once the aura of chaos dissipated, heaven's will might not hold a grudge and this person might become a candidate."You go first!"Li Hao looked at Lin Hongyu. Without saying anything, Lin Hongyu quickly took off.Li Hao continued to wait.No one knew what he was still waiting for.……The wind blew and the clouds surged.In the great wilderness, dark clouds covered the sky.Hurricane city.A sky screen also appeared in Zheng Yu's hands. He looked at Da Huang, but he couldn't see it clearly, so he frowned slightly.Li Hao had been hovering in the air for many days.Was it to deal with Da Huang's chaos Qi?What was this guy thinking?He didn't understand."Get Ying Hongyue to see me!" He said after a moment of silence.Very quickly, someone left the main hall.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ After a while, Ying Hongyue entered with a smile on her face."Is there something you need, my Lord?"Zheng Yu looked at him and was silent for a while. Then, he slowly said,""Li Hao is still in the great wilderness and hasn't left yet. Now, he's even gathered all the experts of the Silver Moon clan. If the chaos of the great wilderness is destroyed ... The heavens and earth will recover once more, and a Heavenly King might appear ... He doesn't have many saints under him, and if a Heavenly King really appears, together with a few Saints, it'll be enough to destroy him!"This was the path to death!Would Li Hao Do that?Ying Hongyue raised her brows slightly. She pondered for a moment before saying,"Li Hao wouldn't court death! He said that he was not afraid of death ... It was possible that he would not die. He would not send himself to death. Therefore, even if he really wanted to resolve the chaos of the great wilderness, he would definitely have a way to prevent the energy of the recovery of the heaven and earth from leaking out! They might even become their cultivation resources ..."Zheng Yu fell into deep thought.After a long while, he nodded his head."That's true ... But the great wilderness has been destroyed and the Heaven's Will has grown stronger. It must be evenly distributed. It can't be that the energy can be gathered in one place ... Unless ..."He thought for a long time and said, unless he even wants to suppress the will of heaven ... Ying Hongyue also started to think. She nodded, "It's possible! However ... Heaven's will was everywhere and it was very difficult to suppress it. He was still blessed by heaven's will. If he had a way to suppress it, he might do so! Since he's been staying in the great wilderness this entire time, it means that he really has the intention to do so ... And he might even be able to do it. "They didn't have much understanding of domains, but judging from Li Hao's actions, perhaps ... This guy had such intentions."Do you want to go and take a look?"Zheng Yu looked at him. The current Ying Hongyue was even more powerful than before. Her eight great bloodlines were even more stable now because he had already obtained the Zheng family's stone gate inheritance."My Lord, do you want to go and take a look?" Ying Hongyue's heart moved."Don't you think that it's ... Very inappropriate for him to remain in the great wilderness?"Ying Hongyue nodded and said,"there are some!" Li Hao is hard to kill ... But if we can destroy some of his plans ... That's not bad either!"Although he said that, he didn't really care.Li Hao's strength had its benefits.He won by lying down!Of course, ever since Li Hao had said that he would merge with his bloodline, he had actually been quite afraid.It was good to win while lying down, but Li Hao was getting stronger and stronger, which put a lot of pressure on him.Looking at the situation, it would be best if he could destroy it.At this moment, Zheng Yu suddenly said,"how about this, you bring 10 Saints to the vast wilderness!" "In addition, arrange for some people to go to the main cities. My clone ... Will go to the star Town ruins. As for Li Hao, even if we can't kill Li Hao, it'll be good if we can get rid of some new martial artists!"I'll bring people?"My Lord, you mean ..." Ying Hongyue's heart moved slightly."You lead the team, you make the decision!"Zheng Yu looked at him and said,'you're a smart person! It's fine as long as you don't kill them on purpose. You can choose the right time to act. If it's beneficial to us, you can let them attack at any time! In addition, 10 Saints are not as useful as the inheritances behind the other seven stone gates. I know where these inheritances are, do you understand?"Ying Hongyue's heart moved slightly, and she hurriedly said,"Daren has misunderstood. How could I do that, but ... Will the other seniors be dissatisfied?""My words are orders!""Just do it," Zheng Yu said coldly."No one will object to you!""Then ... Thank you for your trust, Sir!"Ying Hongyue didn't say much, but Zheng Yu was quite bold and thought highly of her. He directly asked her, who wasn't one of his own, to make the decision. Was he choosing the right time?He didn't say anything else. He was still considering Li Hao's goal. Perhaps ... That guy could really isolate himself from the will of the heavens and invade the vast wilderness?That would be terrifying!If that's the case ... Heaven's will would be devoured, and Da Huang would be devoured. The remaining heaven's will wouldn't come after me, right?When he thought of this, he was shocked.That was not a good thing!It might bring him some benefits, but the consequences would be more troublesome.For Zheng Yu to ask him to go ... Could he have already determined something? after all, he was a half-step sovereign and should be very familiar with these things. Perhaps ... He also had this intention.

In that case, the purpose of letting me lead the team is obvious!At that time, I'll become the core force to deal with Li Hao. More importantly, it might lead to an even greater danger. It's not easy to take the will of the heavens.As he walked out, he pondered. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Would the Queen go?If he were to go ... How could he throw these things to her?I don't really want it!If he were to rashly get involved, he would already be Li Hao's mortal enemy, and if he were to become a person blessed by the heavens ... It would be even more troublesome.Many thoughts flashed through her mind. Soon, Ying Hongyue ordered her troops and left Hurricane city with a few Saints.As for Zheng Yu, he silently watched them leave.A moment later, he also created a clone and left.Maybe he should go to star suppression city.……The great wilderness.The heavens and earth trembled as a transparent membrane appeared in the sky above the great wilderness.As for Li Hao, the power of his great Dao emerged.Dao meridians appeared one after another, and giant Dragons circled the world.The commotion was getting bigger and bigger.The divine sword above his head seemed to feel that Li Hao was about to destroy chaos. At this moment, it began to gather and turn into a small sword, ready to attack.If the chaos will was killed, the entire Silver Moon would be United again.In the vast wilderness, the White Horse neighed uneasily.At this moment, the Black Panther simply rode on the White Horse, lying on the White Horse to comfort the other party ... It seemed like it was up to no good.Li Hao didn't care about them. His Dao Meridian appeared and covered the world."Shanqi, stabilize the world!" He shouted.The branches of the red fir tree covered the void and extracted a large amount of chaos Qi. At this moment, a red fir tree covered the sky and the sun. It was extremely powerful."The king of Dali ... Gather the will of heaven!"The Dali King's expression changed slightly. Without saying anything, he roared, and heaven's will gathered in the void. It was much weaker than Li Hao 's.Li Hao, on the other hand, was transmitting his thoughts to the void."Attack the great wilderness, kill the chaos will, seize the great wilderness, and unite the Heaven's Will. May the heaven help me!"The Heaven's Will rolled.The entire Silvermoon world seemed to be rolling.……"It's starting!"On the moon, the man with the sword on his back said softly,""It seems ... It's really as I expected. However ... This guy might really know of my existence."After saying that, the moon seemed to illuminate the entire world."Lin Hongyu seems to be doing something ..." He said after a while."The officials of heavenstar are calling on the people to stay at home today. They've also distributed countless sky screens ... There are even large amounts of energy stones ..." The moon goddess replied.The sword-carrying man sighed,"that's a good idea!" Using the Dao of the people to resist the counterattack of heaven's will? This was a good idea! Li Hao is a man with his own ideas. Perhaps there's really a chance of resisting ... Heaven's will is also the manifestation of the public's will. If so ... Li Hao might be able to eliminate the influence. "This guy had a brain."Then what do we do?""There's no rush, we haven't seen the results yet. It's not certain whether the will of the people can triumph over the will of heaven! Li Hao had been in charge of the world for too short a time ... The will of the heavens was boundless, and it was very difficult for him to do anything against the heavens. Li Hao ... Might suffer a great loss! Just like last time, we were attacked by the public!""He's betting that the will of the people will be Stronger Than heaven's will?""Maybe."The sword-bearing man pondered for a moment and didn't say anything else.Perhaps.There was still a chance of success. Even if it was just to disrupt the Heaven's Will for a while, it might still succeed.This idea, this method, was not something that ordinary people could do.In the current world, there were not many people who could still use the People's hearts.……At the same time.Heavenly Star City.The ruins of the Heavenly Star Town.Lin Hongyu looked at the puppets who were in a commotion and said softly,""The Marquis said that director Zhang has appeared and taken away many neo martial artists. If you are willing to follow director Zhang, you can wait here. He should come to pick you up soon!""If I want to make a living on my own ... I want to break away from the influence of some neo martial artists and see if I can go further. I can work together for great things!""Now, there is a chance, but ... There are some things you might not want to do, or things you might not be willing to do. The Marquis wants you to come with me to the divine Kingdom and take it! Kill those who resist! The divine Kingdom has countless believers, so it might be a slaughter...The Lord does not wish for the strong to slaughter the weak. However, in this era, we can not be soft-hearted!"She looked at the crowd."Those who are willing to follow me, follow me. Those who aren't willing ... Just wait for director Zhang!"Among the group of puppets, some were silent while others were hesitating.However, there were also quite a few people who walked out without saying a word.As for Zhang an, their teacher ... Everyone had their own choices. Their teacher's path might not be the right one. To them, their teacher was worthy of respect, but they did not have to follow him in everything.God nation was not neo martial.What was there to care about?Just kill!Lin Hongyu took a look and saw that there were quite a few of them, close to a hundred.There were actually quite a number of students in Yuanping martial arts university. There were nearly 400 of them. However, many of them wanted to stay and continue waiting for Zhang an.She didn't care.Enough! Close to a hundred people, almost all of them had the power of the sun and moon, which was enough.Now, if all the gods left ... There was no need to fear Scandinavia.Even if he managed to kill a Saint ... With so many puppets and his strength at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier, even if he couldn't kill a Saint, he wouldn't have to be afraid of the other party."In that case, I'll have to trouble you all ... The more people there are, the more conspicuous it will be. Compress your puppet bodies and enter the Earth drilling shuttle. We'll leave together," zhang xuan said.

The puppets didn't say much. Their leader was also a robot cat.Lin Hongyu was quite familiar with them. She called out,""Senior li!"The robot cat turned to look at her."Senior ... Do you want to go too?" Lin Hongyu asked politely.She had met this person a long time ago.It was said that he had come out with Jiang Yingli at the time. Later, Jiang Yingli had chosen to side with Li Hao, but this person had never made a decision. Why did he choose to join today?Li shengzhang was silent for a while, then said,""Clean up the remnants! The Zheng family, the Zhou family, and the Liu family are all from Star Town City. I didn't know that they had betrayed us. Now, my teacher hasn't dealt with these rebels. I don't know what he is thinking, but to me ... These people have tarnished Star Town City! "Saturn city is not a place of betrayal. It's the Holy Land of new martial arts and the backbone of new martial arts!""Countless powerful cultivators have come out of star suppression city. There are venerable sovereigns Shen and Chen who activated new martial arts, other families who have protected the human race for countless years, and the Li family's ancestor who ruled the world ... He is also my family's ancestor! Star suppression city is a Holy Land, a glorious land, not a traitor in the eyes of the Silvermoon people!"She indeed didn't want to join Li Hao's side.But ... The three families in star suppression city had all betrayed him!This was a kind of torture and humiliation for those who were born and raised in star suppression city.So, she decided not to wait for her teacher.Lin Hongyu nodded her head."You also believe me. You also understand that these people can't represent the entire city!"After that, he didn't say anything more.He led the group of people into the earth-drilling shuttle.Very quickly, the earth-drilling shuttle started up, and the group of people disappeared.The remaining puppets were all rather complicated.Another group of people left.Their former classmates had also parted ways.The students were silent for a while. At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of them. Many of them were excited."Teacher!""You're back!"Zhang an looked around and saw that many people had left. He knew that Li Hao's people had left, so he didn't say anything. He looked at the crowd and said,""Are you still willing to come with me?""I'm willing!"Many people answered hurriedly. Some were impatient."Teacher, I heard that teacher has already recruited some neo martial artists. Why don't you take the initiative to attack and deal with the traitors of the Zheng family ... Even if you can't kill Zheng Yu, it seems that a Saint has appeared in the Zheng family ... You must kill them all!""Don't worry, it will happen sooner or later. "Zhang an said,"let's not talk about this now. Since you're willing to leave with me ... Then leave with me!" I'm afraid it won't be peaceful for the time being, so Silver Moon will probably have a clear answer soon ... I'll restore your neo martial bodies, so let's go!"With a wave of his hand, a book appeared like a battleship, and the students walked up to it.Zhang an closed his book and looked around. At this moment, there was no one in the Heavenly Star ruins!He had stayed here for a while.After taking a glance, he didn't say anything and quickly walked out of the ruins.Then, he looked to the East. The wind was blowing and the clouds were rolling, as if a thunderstorm was about to come."Da Huang ... The power of the domain?"Li Hao had prepared some backup plans, but they might not be enough. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  His opponents were all terrifying.At this moment, Zhang an looked up at the sky again and saw a bright moon setting in the East.Was it there?Even if they were there, they probably wouldn't be able to come out in a short time. Zhang an quickly disappeared.The direction was not the East.On the other side, since Li Hao had decided to do this, he could deal with it himself. At this moment, he was going to the North. Li Hao's movements were so big that Zheng Yu would definitely pay attention to it.Zheng Yu's main body was still in Hurricane city.However ... The Zhou family's Galaxy city didn't have Zheng Yu's true body.In front of him, a figure appeared on the page.Zhang an's voice rang out from the book. This book was like a world of its own. The group of people stopped in it and were not suppressed by the world."Take down Star River City! Annihilate the Zhou family first! After we take over Galaxy city, we'll go to the seal. It'll be very dangerous. If you're afraid, you can leave and join Li Hao's side. ""Who would be afraid? Neo martial artists were never afraid! Even director Zhang dared to do it, so what are we afraid of? "The director's status is noble, so she must be with the director. The neo martial artists will solve all the problems themselves!"Very quickly, someone replied.Zhang an smiled and said,"killing a venerable sovereign ... Impossible!" "However, if we take Silver Moon, there is still hope ... Sword city is also among them, and there should be no one left. If we take sword city, take Galaxy city, and take Silver Moon ... Only then will we have a chance to become the fourth party!"The Silver Moon was not the world, but ... The moon goddess herself!"We will follow the chief's orders!" Everyone in the book said.Zhang an did not say anything more and quickly disappeared.This was a rare opportunity!He could take advantage of this opportunity to seize the star River City and drive it into the seal. This would also stimulate Zheng Yu.……At this moment, all parties were making their own calculations.Above the great wilderness, heaven's will gathered and Thunder rumbled. It could descend upon the great wilderness at any moment to destroy the chaos will.At this moment, Li Hao's expression was grave.Success or failure depended on this one move.He glanced at the North, then at the sky. Li Hao suddenly smiled ... Will ... People come?The Silver Moon, in the end, still belonged to the Silver Moon people."Black Panther, get ready!"Li Hao shouted. The next moment, with a thought, the divine sword above his head suddenly burst out and headed straight for the white horses in the great wilderness. Li Hao's voice resounded in all directions."Destroy the chaos and rule the Silver Moon. The will of heaven can not be disobeyed. Kill!"BOOM!The Heaven's Will swept out, and the clouds moved in all directions. Countless amounts of energy swept over, and in an instant, the entire great desolate region was filled with energy.The Heaven's Will turned into a long sword and charged towards the White Horse!On the other hand, the hole that was left in the domain of the great wilderness ... Gradually began to close. Li Hao's Dao meridians appeared, and divine runes emerged. The word 'Dao' hung in the sky. He was going to seal the great wilderness!Boom! Boom! Boom!The White Horse also exploded with powerful heaven and earth energy. Chaos swept out in all directions, and its roar instantly resounded.The Heaven's Will and the chaos will had come into contact!Thunder and lightning struck!At this moment, the entire Silvermoon world seemed to be shaking. Countless people were terrified, as if they felt a calamity on their heads.(Double the monthly votes, vote a little, pitiful)

The Heaven's Will attacked.The White Horse roared.At this moment, the White Horse formed by the chaos will also instantly transformed into a giant beast, letting out an earth-shaking roar at the long sword.BOOM!The two intents collided, and a heaven-shaking energy wave swept through Da Huang.But at this moment, Li Hao closed the last gap.The Heaven's Will seemed to have sensed something.However, it was too late.The White Horse roared madly. At the same time, a Black Dog appeared. It swallowed the world and turned into a giant beast, biting at the long sword!The White Horse and the Black Panther fought against the will of the heavens.The Heaven's Will turned into a sword. At this moment, it seemed to realize that it had been fooled. Thunder rumbled, and Thunder exploded. The Thunder sword pierced through the heaven and earth. In the distance, King Dali's expression suddenly changed.In the next moment, his consciousness seemed to be a little muddled, and he threw a punch at the void Black Panther.At the same time, Princess ni, who was wearing golden armor, suddenly roared and charged at King Dali with her spear!At this moment, the two of them seemed to have lost some of their consciousness and were being controlled by the Heaven's Will and the chaos will.The battle-power of both sides suddenly soared.BOOM!The fist and spear collided, and the heavens and earth shook. Countless divine runes appeared as if they were about to tear the heavens and earth apart.At this moment, the Redwood quickly rooted itself in the world, stabilizing it.The others also stood in all directions, sealing off the area.All of this had been expected.Li Hao's body was trembling slightly.It stabilized the entire great wilderness's heaven and earth domain.The battle between chaos and heaven's will caused the domain to tremble continuously. At the same time, Thunder suddenly rumbled near Li Hao, and heaven's will appeared. It was the Heaven's Will that had yet to gather.Not only that, but at this moment, there seemed to be heaven's will erupting in the distance and gathering over.A sword seemed to have appeared in the sky above the entire Silver Moon.It was as if he was going to split the great wilderness!Li Hao's eyes flickered.Stop?Don't stop him?If he stopped them, he would offend the will of heaven. If he didn 't, the great wilderness would be destroyed and all his plans would be useless.At this moment, Li Hao made a decision. At this moment, large cities floated in the air and shook violently, devouring the world and stirring the wind and clouds. The will of heaven was shaken again.They had no choice but to retreat a portion of it to suppress the entire world.However, Li Hao still had the majority of the Heaven's Will.Li Hao's expression changed slightly. At this moment, a long sword appeared in his hand and he slashed at the sky!……"They're attacking!"The moment Li Hao attacked, the man with the sword on his back sighed.Once he made a move ... He would become the enemy of heaven's will.  From the looks of it, Li Hao didn't choose to fight back in the end. He had thought that Li Hao would choose to fight back, not retaliate, or find a way to trick heaven's will. In the end ... Li Hao didn't seem to do that, nor did he think of doing that.He had really become the enemy of heaven's will.It was a good thing for him, but this Li Hao ... Lacked wisdom and gained courage. He didn't know if he should be happy or disappointed.……At this moment, Li Hao shouted and pulled out his sword."Kill!"BOOM!The Heaven's Will didn't seem to have understood what was going on before, but at this moment, it was instantly enlightened and enraged.This Son of Heaven had revolted!In the world of Silvermoon, Li Hao had received the greatest blessing from the heavens, but in the end ... He rebelled!It was the same as being betrayed by his most beloved son!How hateful!At the same time, in the surroundings.Ying Hongyue's expression changed. At this moment, heaven's will was suspended above her and started to gather. Heaven's will didn't possess a very strong combat power. Whether it was the Thunderbolts or the long swords, they were powerful but had ordinary combat power.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  It needed a carrier!At this moment, it was gathering near Ying Hongyue, as if it was going to enter her body to help her, control her, and kill a traitor like Li Hao!The other portion was currently gathering in another direction.The Queen was overjoyed.As expected, the Prophet was right. The will of heaven would favor him again.Her thoughts were completely different from Ying Hongyue's ... Since the Heaven's Will favored her, she would naturally accept it. In an instant, the Heaven's Will turned into a rolling force that merged into her body, and the Queen's aura instantly skyrocketed!At this moment, it was as if the barrier between heaven and earth had been broken.Ying Hongyue's expression changed as she thought of something. In the next moment, she suddenly took the initiative to attack the sky. She threw a punch, and with a boom, the Heaven's Will shook!The Heaven's Will seemed to be a little angry ... This one was also rebelling?The world was its!Today, it wanted to favor this person, but this person actually rebelled?In his anger, he wanted to kill her, but the biggest traitor was still dealing with him. In his anger, the Heaven's Will didn't choose to deal with Ying Hongyue. Instead, it quickly dispersed and rushed toward the Queen in the distance!Ying Hongyue's expression kept changing.He had given up a chance to become stronger!But ... He didn't really regret it.This was not a good thing.At this moment, accepting heaven's will required him to fight Li Hao. He was also surprised that Li Hao dared to betray heaven's will and even take the initiative to attack it. He was really bold.However, fighting Li Hao now wasn't his goal.At this moment, a Saint beside him frowned.""Why did you refuse?"Then, he looked at Li Hao, who was killing the Heaven's Will with a sword, and said in a deep voice,""At this moment, he has been abandoned by the Heaven's Will. This world can no longer contain him, so it's the best time to kill him! The four Saints are stirring up a storm ... Li Hao is seeking his own death. The opportunity is just right. If we kill him, we'll definitely achieve something!"The opportunity had come!In fact, there were more than ten Saints. Four gods had come as well. In addition to the Queen and Ying Hongyue, there were a total of 16 top-tier experts. As for Li Hao, he didn't dare to open the great wilderness.

2207 Chapter 371
When they opened up the wasteland, heaven's will came out.If he escaped to the Dao universe, his seal might be broken. Even if he could escape, he could ruin Li Hao's plan and make him abandoned by the world. He could even kill Redwood and the others.16 Saint-level experts could even kill a Heavenly King!The timing was just right!Not only that, one of the ancient Saints said,""He's being targeted by the Heaven's Will now. Perhaps ... The great Dao universe can't be opened. He might be able to kill Li Hao in one fell swoop!"They all looked at Ying Hongyue. Li Hao was courting death. If they didn't kill him now, when would they?Before they left, Zheng Yu had said to listen to Ying Hongyue. However, everyone was unhappy when they saw that he was not willing to accept heaven's will.Another Saint said,"right now, Li Hao is the enemy of heaven and earth. If we join forces and kill him, we might be favored by heaven. Even if we can't control heaven and earth, we can make heaven's will side with us. We won't be targeted by heaven and earth again!""Ying Hongyue, why aren't you attacking together?"A few Saints spoke one after another. Ying Hongyue frowned and shook her head."You can't ...""Ying Hongyue!"A Saint was furious,"whose side are you on?" Is the hatred between you and Li Hao real or fake? This is a rare opportunity ..."BOOM!The explosion resounded through the sky. At this moment, the Queen had made her move. At this moment, the Queen was like the most loved child in the world. The Heaven's Will swept in all directions. The Queen's body was covered in golden light. The lightning avoided the Queen as she wandered in the energy. She struck out with her scepter, bringing with it the power of the heaven and earth. It was simply unparalleled!Even though Li Hao was powerful and had the power of the Dao integration stage, he seemed to be in imminent danger at this moment.The few Saints could no longer sit still!"Ying Hongyue ..."They were furious that Zheng Yu actually asked them to listen to this coward.Ying Hongyue also kept frowning."Seniors, it might not be safe. How could Li Hao not know about this? "He knows that if he still dares to do so, it means that he's confident in dealing with it. If we go up, we might fall into their trap ...""What trap?""What other traps are there?" one of the Saints asked angrily. He had reached his limit, and while sealing the great desolation, he was also dealing with the Heaven's Will ... The Saints of heaven battling city were all controlling the city and stirring up the heaven and earth to prevent more heaven's will from gathering! If we don't make a move now ... When will the next time be?"An excuse!It was this guy's cowardice and fear of death that made them furious.A Saint said in a deep voice,"the general is out there, and he can't obey military orders!" Since you're not going ... Before you left, although our Lord told us to listen to you, you're obviously afraid of Li Hao. Since that's the case, we don't need to worry about him. If he's not going, we'll go!"The auras of the 10 Saints shook.In the distance, the auras of the other gods were also shaking.Obviously, they were all ready to kill Li Hao.Ying Hongyue's expression changed, and she also said in a deep voice, "It's definitely not that simple. Let me think ... Perhaps ... This is the result Li Hao wants to see ..."He looked around. An ambush? That might not be the case!No one was lying in ambush?Then ... What kind of means?He thought hard and soon realized something. He quickly looked around and thought of something. Perhaps ... Li Hao wanted heaven's will to favor them, or even let them enter his body!It shook the heavens!The People's hearts could be used!At this moment, Ying Hongyue realized something. Just as she was about to speak, she heard a Saint say coldly,""Ignore him. He's a fool and a coward. No wonder he's being chased by Li Hao!"  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly as she looked at the few of them. She quickly swallowed the words that were at the tip of her tongue and sighed softly,"My Lord asked me to come here because I'm being reliable. If you don't believe me, then there's nothing I can do! If you trust me, then stay ..."Without waiting for him to finish speaking, a few of the Saints immediately soared into the sky and left. The remaining few hesitated for a moment before some of them quickly left as well. In the end, there were actually two saints who chose to stay.Ying Hongyue shot a glance at them. She didn't know if they were staying behind to watch her or if they really believed in her.The other eight Saints didn't seem to care about the two of them.With the eight of them and the few from the divine Kingdom, they were strong enough to kill Li Hao.Ying Hongyue's eyes flickered for a moment. She glanced at the Queen, who was showing off her strength and continuously beating Li Hao back with her scepter, and her expression changed.The Queen was blessed by heaven's will, and she was so powerful that words could not describe it!But ... This might not be a good thing.On the other hand, could he gain some benefits from this change?At this moment, the Heaven's Will shook and swept in all directions.It had enveloped the entire great wilderness. No expert would be able to detect anything that was done here. At this moment, even if a Saint died, there would probably be no movement. No one would be able to sense anything.……In the distance.In the great wilderness.Li Hao's long sword pierced through the sky.Bang! Bang!The sounds did not stop. The Queen was extremely excited at this moment. She pressed down with her scepter, suppressing the sword will. She revealed a smile. She was much better than the others and was not completely controlled by the Heaven's Will.At this moment, he was even more excited.Li Hao, who had been suppressing her all this time, had chosen to betray the will of the heavens and let her have it easy. She felt that her strength was even rising to the level of a Heavenly King!It was too powerful!The endless energy poured into his body. Every move he made seemed to be assisted by the world. The momentum of the world suppressed Li Hao. No matter how strong Li Hao was, he found it difficult to withstand it.

2208 Chapter 371
Even if you have killed a Heavenly King, it is useless.At this moment, the four deities charged over from all directions. Each of them seemed to have been blessed by the will of heaven as they attacked!The world was suppressing the traitor Li Hao!The abilities of the gods of misfortune and disaster were even more terrifying at this time. With the blessing of the heavens, Li Hao was struck by bad luck and disasters as soon as they attacked!The sword suddenly cut the void, and countless cracks appeared in the void. With a boom, Li Hao's body was hit.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  This was the case for those who opposed the heavens!Li Hao instantly started bleeding. He frowned.The Heaven's Will ... Might seem useless, but if he really went against it, he would be able to sense its usefulness. In that moment, he could see fate, his fate of death, his fate of being killed!That was the influence of the God of fate. Her physical body, which had been destroyed by the God of beginner martial, had reappeared. Her strength had dropped a lot, but with the blessing of heaven's will, she seemed to have recovered.At this moment, the Prophet God was also constantly foreseeing something. However, the heavenly will here was in chaos ... Every time he foresaw something, there was only one result: Li Hao would die!That was because the heavens wanted him dead!Therefore, the foretelling result at this moment was Li Hao's death. The interference of heaven's will was the greatest possibility in the future.The five experts had joined forces and were all blessed by heaven's will.BOOM!Li Hao was sent flying by the Queen's scepter. At this moment, another eight auras soared into the sky. A cold-faced Saint said in a loud voice,""Li Hao, you've done too much injustice. The heavens have abandoned you. Today, I'll kill you, you demon!"Those who had the ability to defy the heavens were called crazy.If he didn't have this heaven-defying ability, he would be an idiot.Li Hao didn't have the ability to defy the heavens and betray the will of the heavens. If he didn't die, who would?"Ying Hongyue and Zheng Yu's clones didn't come?"Li Hao took a few steps back and suddenly staggered. The air exploded. He laughed at himself. How unlucky.His leg was a bloody mess.As expected, offending heaven's will was truly a dead end.The eight Saints charged over.At this moment, a total of 13 top-tier powerhouses had gathered, and they had even been blessed by the heavens to deal with Li Hao, who had betrayed the will of the heavens. Even a Heavenly King would find it difficult to reverse such an outcome.In the vast wilderness, the Black Panther and the White Horse were madly surrounding the long sword formed by heaven's will.The others were still suppressing and consolidating the world.Everyone's expression changed drastically!13th place!This was beyond their imagination, too much.They knew it was dangerous, but in their imagination, Zheng Yu's side wouldn't know too quickly, and even the gods wouldn't know immediately. Perhaps by the time they knew, they would have already completed their task.But ... It had come too quickly.It was much faster than he had imagined!It was too fast, too fast, and there were too many of them. A total of 13 people!It's finished!At this moment, director Zhao and the others all stepped out of Da Huang. Qian Wuliang shouted,"No! This place is sealed off. If we go out and the Heaven's Will runs away, who will be responsible?" Tian Jian roared,"if we don't go out...We're finished!" Give up on killing the Heaven's Will and let him escape into the great Dao universe!"Qian Wuliang felt a bit helpless.Just as he was thinking about how to deal with it, he heard Hong Yitang say softly,""Alright, don't worry! Suppress this place first and consolidate your domain. If he wanted to leave ... He would've left a long time ago. Everyone, be quiet. Hurry up and consolidate your domain. Use force to suppress him!"With that, the earth-crushing sword aura dispersed. Their purpose was not to deal with the Heaven's Will. Anyone who dealt with the Heaven's Will would be easily remembered by the Heaven's Will.Right now, they only had one goal-to suppress and stabilize the great wilderness.He didn't want Li Hao's domain to be shattered.When the others heard this, their expressions changed. They were anxious and helpless. They could only unleash their power one by one to suppress and consolidate their strength. Many people were so anxious that they were sweating.13th place!This time, it was really troublesome.……One move!,m BOOM!Li Hao grunted, and seven or eight bloody wounds appeared on his body. Even his orange armor was shattered.The 13 powerhouses had injured him in the blink of an eye.And these 13 powerhouses, even the 8 neo martial realm powerhouses, at this moment, all received the blessing of the Heaven's Will. Obviously, the angry heaven's will was very satisfied with these people who helped it kill the rebels!The eight neo martial artists were also very satisfied.Not bad!It was too difficult for neo martial artists to get the blessing of heaven's will.But now, he had done it.They had only attacked Li Hao once. If they killed Li Hao, they would even receive a large amount of blessings from the heavens, which would allow them to cultivate even faster in the future. Ordinary people would not be able to kill them, and they would be able to burst out with even more powerful strength.His luck would also be extremely good!The Queen didn't seem to be satisfied with these people.However, she had previously recovered her four deities with Zheng Yu's help. At this moment, she didn't say anything and only looked coldly at Li Hao. Li Hao had caused her to suffer heavy losses many times.Today, he could finally take his revenge!"Kill him!""Attack!" The Queen shouted in a low voice. The next moment, everyone attacked, and the sky fell and the earth cracked!Li Hao's expression was cold. 13 Saints. Not to mention him, even a Heavenly King would die with hatred!Have they all made their moves?As expected, Ying Hongyue didn't come!Just make your move!The moment everyone was about to kill Li Hao, Li Hao shouted. Suddenly, the universe of the great path trembled, and countless Dao meridians floated in the sky. Li Hao roared,""Common people, help me!""Man can defeat the heavens, kill the devil!"A fierce roar shook the world.At this moment, all the living beings seemed to have sensed Li Hao's thoughts.

2209 Chapter 371
At this moment, countless people muttered,"man can conquer the heavens!"The heavens and earth trembled, and the Heaven's Will trembled. It was as if the Heaven's Will was being disturbed by billions of lives. The experts who had received the blessing of the Heaven's Will suddenly felt as if something had exploded!His mind was muddled!At that moment, there was only one thought in their minds ... Man can conquer the heavens!It was a thought formed by hundreds of millions of lives.The 13 powerhouses were all blessed by the Heaven's Will and fell into chaos.This was exactly what Li Hao wanted.It would only take an instant!The human will might not be a match for heaven's will, but it could definitely disrupt them for a moment. Without the blessing of heaven's will, Li Hao would be finished if he faced 13 Saints alone. He was definitely no match for them.But these people were too greedy!Why did he have to make a move at this time?However, how many people were not greedy?"Li daoheng ... Didn't you see this coming? Or did you predict it, but you don't care?"Li Hao didn't say anything. At this moment, his longsword burst out with a dazzling radiance. A small sword appeared in his body and merged with the starry sky sword, slashing the world with one strike! "Kill!"Before the few experts who were closer could even recover from their shock, their bodies and minds were destroyed.Li Hao quickly approached and struck out with his sword again. The sky was shattered, and a Saint was turned into dust by him. In the distance, the two saints beside Ying Hongyue turned pale with fright!How did this happen?The 13 powerhouses seemed to have been fixed in place.He allowed Li Hao to kill with his sword!"Dodge!"The two of them roared with some shock and fear.How did this happen?The Heaven's Will was actually in chaos!At this moment, a loud voice came from the sky,""Man can conquer the heavens! The demon Slayer!"This demon was not Li Hao.It was the will of the heavens!The Heaven's Will stirred in all directions, shaking continuously. The few people who were supported by the Heaven's Will all had pained expressions.Li Hao slashed out with his sword, and another Saint shattered.He turned around and threw a punch. With a loud explosion, another one appeared.He reached out and crushed a God into pieces. Countless energy exploded and swept through the world.The Heaven's Will seemed to be resisting!Li Hao knew that it wouldn't last long.He had to kill as many experts as possible.The speed had to be fast!He drew his sword and killed!Kachaa!Another Saint was crushed by Li Hao's sword. His spiritual body was shattered by Li Hao's roar.The heavens fell and the earth cracked! At this moment, a few people's expressions changed, and their bodies trembled. It seemed like heaven's will was going to cancel out the influence of the people.Li Hao glanced around. In this instant, he had killed four neo martial Saints and two deities. He had only killed six. That was too little.Not enough!"Kill!"The demonic sword pierced through the sky and earth as it slashed out. Li Hao's main body also transformed into a sword and pierced through a person. This was a rare opportunity. In the distance, Ying Hongyue and the other two had pale faces and didn't dare to come over. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  This was too surprising!The 13 powerhouses were frozen in place for a moment.Another Saint was killed by the starry sky sword, and Li Hao's original body also instantly killed another ...Eight!Six new martial Saints and two gods.There were only five people left!Li Hao didn't go against the Queen. If he did ... It might cause a chain reaction. He could already sense that these people were about to wake up.If he attacked now, he might be able to kill one more person.But ... At this moment, Li Hao didn't make a move.Instead, he took advantage of the chaos in the Heaven's Will to shout and his domain suddenly expanded, covering all of them into the great wilderness, including the energy that had just seeped out, heaven's will, saintly way, Origin Energy, divine power ...At this moment, Li Hao had enveloped everyone.And in that very moment ... The five of them woke up.They didn't have time to think, and the five of them instantly retreated.In the next moment, they looked at each other, and their faces turned pale with shock!The Queen's face was pale!At this moment, the God of misfortune and disaster was killed. His Natal star wasn't broken, and he might be able to be resurrected. However, he had to pay a huge price every time. The remaining two Zheng Saints were even more shocked.How did this happen?"Li Hao!""You schemed against us!" The Queen gritted her teeth.Li Hao gasped for breath. At this moment, the entire great wilderness was expanding crazily. After killing so many experts, the energy almost materialized and covered the great wilderness. Furthermore, even more heaven's will had gathered together.At this moment, the Black Panther and the White Horse had a chance of devouring the small sword. However, the small sword suddenly expanded, and the Heaven's Will that had entered the Saints 'bodies gathered together again. The Black Panther and the White Horse shrieked in pain.Li Hao looked at the five Saints and laughed."It was just a simple confrontation ... I can only say that your will is too weak and you were actually controlled by heaven's will!"Their faces were cold and they were extremely angry!Li Hao had actually caused chaos in the heavens.Damn it!In an instant, they had lost a total of eight experts. It was too disastrous.The Queen was also furious and gnashed her teeth. Li Hao, however, laughed."Out of the five of you ... A few of you must stay behind today!"The two new martial Saints looked at each other and suddenly looked outside. Ying Hongyue and the others were still there.Could Li Hao still shake the will of the heavens now?Enter this place ... Or attack from the outside and break through the wasteland!Even if many of them died, it would be enough to deal with Li Hao.Just as they were thinking of this, Li Hao suddenly disappeared and reappeared above the White Horse. He opened his huge mouth and swallowed the White Horse.
