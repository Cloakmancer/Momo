        ach to the South.
         The group of people began to eat.
         Li Hao gobbled up his food. Everyone around him was silent, and only the sound of eating and chewing could be heard.
         Wang Ming and Kong Jie wanted to say something several times, but in the end, they didn 't.
         The head of the night patrolman branch wanted to open his mouth a few times to break the silence ... But in the end, he chose to remain silent.
         Suddenly, Li Hao raised his glass and gestured to Kong Jie,""Secretary Kong, a toast to you!"
         Kong Jie was slightly stunned.
         He was very strong!
         But at this moment, he was a little surprised. Li Hao ... This strange guy had been silent ever since he got off the ship, except for the few words he said at the beginning. Now, he suddenly proposed a toast to him.
         Even though he was extremely powerful and was the Secretary of the inspection Division, two ranks higher than Li Hao, he still felt somewhat flattered ... Strange kid, suddenly toasting me, he even suspected if he had heard wrong.
          Li Hao raised his cup and drank it all!
         "In this rotten era, I'm sure Silver moon's safety will be guaranteed. I believe that my parents 'death and my friend's death were caused by Silver moon's incapability. The law is laughable, the government is incompetent, supers run amuck, and the three major organizations can't be balanced when it comes to killing ..."
         "I hate this useless Silver Moon official!" Li Hao laughed at himself.
         Kong Jie was a little embarrassed.
         But the next moment, Li Hao slapped the table and shouted,""However, in this terrible era, I suddenly realized that after my parents died, I could still study in peace, take revenge, eat and drink to my heart's content, and even enter the inspection Guild...It's such a F * cking honor!"
         For a moment, Kong Jie didn't know if he was mocking her or if he really meant it.
         Was he mocking her?
         It wasn 't!
         If it was before today, it would be.
         It was mockery!
         Ridiculing a group of powerhouses for being useless had left Silver Moon in a terrible state. All they knew was to act weak, so why had they not gotten rid of the three large organizations earlier?
         However, today ... He suddenly realized that in this era of comparing bad, Silver Moon was really not too bad. The three northern provinces were too bad, the neighboring Linjiang was too bad, and the central region was also too bad. It was so bad that it did not matter even if a big city was destroyed.
         Compared to them, Silver Moon was much more fortunate.
          At least, after his parents 'death, he could still go to school in peace, study in peace, and eat and drink to his heart's content. Part of the reason was because of his parents' inheritance, and another part was because of the Silver City's tuition fees. This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the past, she didn't feel anything.
         He really didn 't!
         There was only resentment and hatred. Why didn't these trash find out Hong Yue's purpose earlier? why didn't they get rid of her earlier?
         But now ... Well, it was still okay.
         People were afraid of comparison.
         "I'll toast everyone again!"
         Li Hao raised his glass to the branch head."As a junior, as a newcomer, and as your new deputy head, I only have one thing to say ... It's normal to be afraid of death. I'm afraid. Everyone is afraid. No one isn 't! "However, I only hope that all of you can do one thing. When the enemy comes ... Don't be the first to run, don't be the first to surrender, and don't be the first to collapse ..."
         The sunlit realm Minister glanced at Li Hao and drank the wine without saying anything.
         After they finished drinking, the old commander said softly,""Don't worry, Mr. Li. We were born and raised in Silver Moon. The people of Silver Moon may not be strong, but they are not afraid of death. Martial masters come from Silver Moon, and the people of Silver Moon all have feelings for the martial world in their bones! The pugilist world lacks everything except ... Passion!"
         This was the Holy Land of the pugilistic world!
         This was the Holy Land of martial arts!
         The people here had grown up listening to stories of Wulin. Perhaps with the rise of superpowers, the Silver Moon Wulin had become a thing of the past. However, when Yuan Shuo walked out and the five beast Kings reappeared, this Wulin ... Had returned!
          Twenty years of ups and downs, some of the older generation once again thought of the martial arts world twenty years ago. It was a bloodbath, but it was also a happy revenge.
         The Silvermoon man had not completely collapsed yet.
         Kong Jie also seemed to have realized something. She glanced at Li Hao, then at the woman and child at a table not far away, and then at the hanging corpse in the distance. She raised her glass to Li Hao. "Don't worry, we're not like that guy Linjiang! That guy isn't weak, but in fact, he's just a dog, a stray dog that only knows how to bark!"
         "His biggest mission is to lock down Silver Moon, not to deal with the Pirates. He might even be secretly supporting the sea demon Pirates of the eight great pirate groups!" Kong Jie said with a hint of mockery. Don't you dare compare Silver Moon to Linjiang, that's looking down on us!"
         He understood what Li Hao meant and the inside story.
         It seemed like he had been triggered by the incident at Linjiang.
         "In the 32 cities of Silver Moon all these years, other than small skirmishes, have you ever seen anyone who dares to massacre civilians on a large scale in Silver Moon? "Even when the star dynasty invaded 200 years ago, Silver Moon rose up to resist. In the end, Silver Moon was worried about the Li Dynasty's invasion, so he chose to compromise and join the star dynasty's system. Otherwise, it would not have been so easy for the star dynasty to take Silver Moon down."
         "The dynasty fears the Silver Moon, so they've banned martial arts, but ... What can they do? Unfortunately, the three great commanders weren't too obedient and ordered them to annihilate the martial arts world. These guys did kill some martial masters, but the ones they killed were those who didn't follow the rules!"
         "Your master is tyrannical and kills people like flies, but because it's still within the rules, didn't the three great commanders also not kill him?"
         Kong Jie laughed and said,"it's a good idea for the Silver Moon people to balance the Silver Moon people ... However, the dynasty doesn't understand the Silver Moon or the martial arts world. In the end, the Wei Wu Army became the Silver Moon Wei Wu Army. It's said that the king of the plains, who founded the Wei Wu Army, vomited blood and almost died of anger! I hate the three great commanders to the core!"
        
         Li Hao smiled and drank a glass of wine. He felt that the wine was bitter, spicy, and sour. He couldn't describe the taste.
         "Director Kong, there's something I don't know if I should ask?"
         As Li Hao said this, he didn't wait for Kong Jie's reply and directly asked,""What's the point?"
         "What?"
         "I say, what are these people after!"
         Li Hao said in a deep voice,'do you not have any other pursuits besides power? The people were living in misery, and corpses were strewn all over the land. Corpses were floating for thousands of miles, and the ground was filled with starving people. Was this the result they wanted? Yes, there were no foreign enemies now. There were no invasions of the catacombs 'alien races as recorded in the ancient civilization, but ... Previously, when the nine divisions were reformed, weren't they still fine? The imperial family enjoyed superior treatment, and the nine divisions ruled the world. Why did they have to dominate a region when they had power? What's the point?"
         Kong Jie was slightly stunned. After a moment, she sighed,""What's the point? You can ask them! Power, profit, fame, and power were nothing more than these. Li Hao, this world doesn't lack ambitious people or evil spirits. When they have power, they will release the evil in their hearts! "Jiusi was a Dragon Slayer. Back then, the dynasty and the royal family oppressed the people of the world. Jiusi stood up and slaughtered this evil Dragon. Although it was not completely successful, Jiusi was still a hero 80 years ago ... But not many years later, Jiusi has also changed."
         "The nine departments controlled the world, and the family controlled the nine departments. 80 years ago, the nine departments were still the nine departments of a family, or the nine surnames of the nine families. Perhaps the first generation of department heads had great ambitions, but 80 years later, it's different!"
         Kong Jie sighed.
          When the nine divisions were reformed, the first Secretary still had some great ambitions. However, when the nine divisions became the nine divisions of a family, such as the Liu family's financial division ... At this time, it had actually changed.
         People's hearts would change.
         These Dragon Slayers eventually became evil dragons and began to guard against and fear each other. The rise of the three major organizations had caused the nine divisions to be wary of each other. They were afraid that they would lose too much power, so they had made some different choices.
         Kong Jie chuckled."Twenty years ago, the three major organizations were newly established when the superpowers rose. They could have been destroyed quickly. The military law Division was very powerful back then, but they were worried that it would take too much energy to deal with the three major organizations, so they chose to avoid the battle! The imperial family's Black armored Army was very strong back then, but the imperial family was worried that if the black armored Army were to be deployed, it would cause a loss in their battle strength. "
         "The other divisions have their own powers as well. It's not like there aren't any martial masters other than the Silver Moon. There's also a portion of the weapons of mass destruction that were excavated from the ruins. They're all very powerful, but everyone's afraid. They're afraid that we won't be able to deal with the other eight divisions or the royal family if we use them."
         "This is one of the main reasons why the three major organizations have not been destroyed yet. The leaders of Ying Hongyue's three large organizations are actually very smart. They knew that this would be the result ..."
         "In the end, the inspection Division decided to set up a night patrol, which received the support of the other eight divisions and the imperial family. Since no one was willing to contribute, they decided to set up a new organization to recruit powerful people from all over the world to work for the nine divisions. At that time, no one expected the superpower Association to rise so quickly in the past 20 years. In the blink of an eye, it surpassed martial masters and even some powerful firearms ..."
         Li Hao didn't say anything after hearing this.
         After drinking a few cups of wine, he looked at the demon hunt squad members who were still eating in the surroundings, and smiled, "Let's not talk about this! Actually, it didn't mean much. The reason why I have such doubts is because I feel a little indignant, indignant, and unwilling!"  "When director Kong said that this era is so bad, and that the nine divisions are also so bad, I felt that ... There was no need to listen to anything else."
         Yes, there was no need.
         This era was rotten to the core.
         The imperial family of the nine divisions might have been in cahoots with the three major organizations. No one was willing to contribute to annihilate the three major organizations. Some of the Chiefs of the major provinces also hoped that the three major organizations would restrain the central region, so they supported them in secret.
         ? It was laughable ... But it was also a fact that the three major organizations were actually doing very well. It was not as difficult as they had imagined. They were hiding like mice.
         It wasn 't!
         The truth was that small fights were not uncommon, but there were no major battles. Could the so-called city-destroying bomb ... Really kill many experts?
          The probability was that the civilians would suffer more.
         On the other hand, the night patrolmen heard that a few dorks had killed the Yama's grandson and seized the heaven Dao ruler. This caused the war to escalate and involve the level of sunguang. Some of the sunguang were beginning to fall.
         Before this, the night patrolmen seemed to be retreating. They had been on the defense and would not take the initiative to attack.
         When Wang Ming said this, Li Hao was a little speechless. He was speechless that those dumbasses had caused trouble for the night patrolmen. Could they be spies?
         Now it seemed that ... Perhaps these few people were the ones who really did things their own way. They did not consider the nine divisions and the imperial family's position and messed around. On the contrary, they did not think much of it. The others all had their own plans.
         Kong Jie didn't say anything else.
         ……
         After everyone finished eating, Li Hao exhaled and said in a clear voice,""After eating and drinking to your heart's content, we'll go to the city to have fun for a day. However ... Pay attention to concealing your identity, and don't expose that you are a demon hunt squad member ... Even if you are exposed, don't cause any disputes, and contact me at any time if anything happens!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Guild leader, we're not going ..."
        
         "Go!"
         "Why not?" Li Hao shouted. Just for today, tomorrow ... Perhaps there won't be any more holidays or rest. There will only be battles and missions to exterminate The Pirates!"
         "I'm going to hang the White shark pirate here today. White shark is not dead, and he still wants to establish himself in the North Sea. Otherwise, if he killed their second and third brothers but didn't dare to respond, wouldn't the other seven clans of Pirates eat him? No matter what, he'll come for revenge. Even if he knows Silver Moon is not to be trifled with, he'll still come!"
         Kong Jie nodded slightly.
         Sometimes, Li Hao could see things very clearly. If the great white shark wanted to establish itself in the North Sea, he had to get rid of Li Hao in order to deter, establish his might, or take revenge.
         Otherwise, the White shark Pirates would be completely crippled.
         Two of their commanders and over 600 supers were killed, but they did not even let out a fart. Who would dare to join the White shark Pirates in the future?
         Perhaps some of the White shark Pirates would run away and join other pirate groups.
         After hearing Li Hao's words, everyone fell silent.
         In the future ... He might not have the chance.
          As everyone thought this, they didn't refuse. Li Hao looked at Wang Ming."You bring everyone there. You pay first!"
         "It's a small matter!"Wang Ming hurriedly said.
         It's not a big deal!
         I really don't lack money.
         Li Hao then looked at Hong Qing and Hong Hao.""The two of you, don't go. Let the garrison here send out 100 men to escort you to swords gate."
         Hong Qing hurriedly nodded.
         Li Hao then looked at Liu Long and said,"there are some corpses on the ship ... Keep them in check. If they have relatives, ask them if they have brought them to swords gate to be buried. If they don't ... The rest of them should be buried on the spot!"
         "Yes!"
         Liu Long's reply was straightforward. At this moment, Liu Long looked at Li Hao in a different light.
         Li Hao didn't care about this. He looked at Kong Jie."Director Kong, if you have any information, please let me know ..."
         After saying that, he thought for a moment and handed over a pair of black armor."Director Kong, you can keep this with you. If you need anything, you can contact me with it from a thousand miles away,"
         Kong Jie's pupils shrank. She looked at Li Hao and said after a while,""I didn't expect you to actually obtain the authority ... This is very rare!"
         It was obvious that he knew some of the uses of the ancient armor.
         "Director Kong, you mean ... Someone else has also obtained the authority?"
         "Yes, the black armored Army of the royal family!"  Kong Jie said in a deep voice,"the black armor Army also seems to have this kind of armor. Moreover ... They should have some authority. Back then, the black armor Army conquered 99 provinces, and they were a thousand miles away. They could often fight together, and their communication was advanced ..."
         The black armored Army!
         This was not the first time he had heard of this name. Li Hao thought of Star Town. He thought of the 100000 troops stationed in Star Town to guard the entire energy island.
         Perhaps, the royal family had obtained some authority over this Garrison.
         That meant that the royal family might have really discovered the ruins of the Heavenly Star Town.
         Were there only a few such armies back then?
         Perhaps, there were others.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The armies of the other seven cities and the Army of the Heavenly Star Town, apart from the eight cities, it was impossible for there to be no other small and medium-sized cities. Perhaps, some people had also obtained some relics, or perhaps some armor.
         Of course, he might not be able to obtain the authority.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. After making some arrangements, Wang Ming left with his men, Hong Qing and the others were responsible for escorting the people to swords gate, and Liu Long arranged for the burial of the bodies on the ship.
         When the corpses were carried out, Li Hao didn't try to hide anything.
         Some of the onlookers who were going south turned pale.
         They did not react this way when they saw the corpses of the Pirates. However, at this moment, many of them were pale.
         Previously, when he heard that a place had been destroyed, he didn't feel much, just like Li Hao. Silver moon's environment was pretty good.
          But now, when he saw the corpses with their internal organs removed, and the young children dying a tragic death ....
         Many people's faces turned pale, and some people's blood surged as they cursed,""Animal!"
         In the end, he still had some courage.
         They could only watch helplessly as the corpses fell one after another. When they thought about how the Pirates had killed so many people, but hadn't been seen, and how the numbers had been seen ... Their hearts ached with grief!
         Some of them secretly rejoiced that the demon hunt squads were nearby last night, otherwise, perhaps it would have been the same as going south. Thinking of this, they looked at the black-armored warriors again, and some of them had a different attitude.
         From the fear, fear, and apprehension before, someone gave him a thumbs-up."Good job! The prestige of my Silver Moon Army is still the number one in the world! Kill those beasts and scatter their souls, good job!"
         In the crowd, an old man also gritted his teeth.""I, the Silvermoon Grandmaster, am the most powerful. Back then, who dared to bully us Silvermoon people? Silver Moon martial masters could do whatever they wanted, and they could close their own doors and kill their own family members. If outsiders wanted to take advantage of them, they couldn 't! If a foreign Martial Master dared to steal a cup of water from us, he would be chased and killed by the Silver Moon Martial Master!"
         Of course, the old man didn't say that the Silver Moon Martial Master wasn't a good person either. Some martial masters were even remembered by the old man. They didn't pay for their meals and drinks. They were like a pain in the ass, asking if you wanted their life or money.
         If you want to die, he will cut his head off for you!
         That's right, the old man still remembered one of them. He had a big beard and spoke very loudly. Later on, someone called him Southern Fist ... The small restaurant that the old man opened back then still owed him 300 star coins. At that time, the star coins were worth a lot of money. He didn't know if that big beard was dead or not!
        
         Fortunately, when the bearded man was beaten to the ground, he was too busy clapping and forgot to collect his debt. The Martial Master who beat him was really a good man. He still couldn't forget it. He seemed to be called ... The big monkey Demon King!
         The old man fell into his memories and looked at the people who died in Linjiang. He sighed and sobered up from his memories. No matter how annoying the bearded man was and how powerful he was, he just didn't pay up. He didn't kill or burn anyone, nor did he ask for money. He just straightened his neck and asked you to cut off his head ... But he didn't see those people so brutal, killing an entire town and city just because of a disagreement.
         ……
         Li Hao only watched and didn't participate.
         He looked at the crowd of onlookers, watching them change from lifeless to somewhat energetic and filled with righteous indignation. They were no longer numb and numb. He suddenly laughed."So ... Everyone has a kind heart, or a heart of empathy. I don't see everyone being numb now."
         Kong Jie looked at Li Hao, then at those people, and helplessly said,""Actually, Silver Moon isn't that numbed in the past, but to be honest, bad news has been coming nonstop over the past few years. If it's not here, it's there. The administration department is also feeling a little helpless ... They don't have the money to reform. If they wanted to change the system, there would be no manpower and resources, and there would be countless constraints. The dynasty is still there, and if we do something stupid, it's easy for the dynasty to focus on Silver Moon. In the past few years, because the outside world is getting worse and worse, even silver Moon has lost some of his passion and vitality. "
         Li Hao nodded."I understand. That's why the world needs a revolution!"
         Li Hao looked into the distance and thought he could see the direction of swords gate. He said in a deep voice,""The world needs to be reformed! A revolution was needed! We'll wipe out all the heroes, tyrants, the royal family, the nine divisions, the military, the dark power organizations, the superpowers in troubled times, the martial masters butchers ... And we'll naturally be able to take on a new look!"
         “……”
         Kong Jie looked at Li Hao as if he was crazy. At this moment, she was stunned.
          Are you crazy, or am I crazy?
         What are you talking about?
         Li Hao didn't care about him. This wasn't what he said. It was something that was mentioned in ancient books. It was something that Hong Yitang and the others vaguely mentioned.
         I don't understand!
         "However, I understand one thing. If you kill all the people who are causing chaos, there will be no more chaos in the world.
         "I will first pacify the world before starting the reform. No one will stop me and I will change the system as I wish.
         There were so many advanced technologies and useful things in the ancient civilization, but how many of them had been promoted now?
         Because there were people who stopped them, because there were people who were unwilling to open the public's wisdom.
         The words of Hong Yitang and the others finally took root in Li Hao's heart.
         Since the world was not peaceful, he would settle these people ... Of course, Li Hao's words were only in a fit of anger because he couldn't do it now, but it was exactly what he was thinking.
         I thought of the ancient king. Are you going to listen?
         If you don't listen, I'll kill!
         I'll kill you all!
         Kong Jie felt a little uncomfortable, while Li Hao disappeared in a flash and reappeared on a pirate ship in the distance.
         He had said enough today.  Keeping a low profile, he didn't want to be high-profile and talk about these things. However, some things still impacted him.
         Li Hao, who had disappeared, reappeared on the pirate ship.
         A moment later, he disappeared from the pirate ship.
         A small boat silently carried the Black Panther and instantly crossed the ocean, disappearing into the vast ocean.
         At this moment, Li Hao ... Had one last thought. He wanted to go and see ...
         Where to?
         To the town that was destroyed.
         He still could not believe that the world was really so dark.
         He wanted to go to the town where Linjiang was destroyed and take a look again. It had been a day, and Linjiang should have heard the news and reacted. He wanted to see what the situation was like there now.
         The giant venomous ship travelled through the sea at an extremely fast speed.
         The speed was getting faster and faster.
         It was extremely fast.
         More than an hour later, Li Hao passed the previous battlefield and continued forward. Another hour later, he passed through the moon sea and approached a tributary of the North Sea, which was actually connected to the cloud River.
         As for Li Hao, he saw flames rising in the distance.
          With a flash, he was like a flying bird, galloping away and disappearing into the sea. Even the small boat disappeared in an instant.
         ……
         After a while.
         Li Hao hovered in the air and looked down.
         A group of soldiers were setting a fire in a dilapidated town. There were also some supers there. The corpses were all burned, and some valuable items that the Pirates did not take were now in the hands of the soldiers.
         They searched house by house.
         "Hurry up!" Someone shouted,"finish the search before dark!" The higher-ups have ordered us to evacuate this place before dark. Get your fire powers ready and burn down Binhai town completely. Don't leave any traces ..."
         Don't leave any traces.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's ears twitched as he heard the voices below lower. Outside the town, a superpower was talking to a general in a low voice."We must clean up all traces and quickly form a document to announce to the public that Binhai town was caught in a water disaster and was burned down by a fire ... Now that Sky Star City is dissatisfied with the North, Pirates invaded and destroyed tens of thousands of people in the town ... If this gets out, we all have to take responsibility."
         "Don't worry, I know what to do. No one survived in Binhai town. They all died in the fire!"
        
         The general also said a few words in a low voice.
         If there were living things, they would also become dead.
         The town had been destroyed by the Pirates. This was a serious matter. Although Kong Yu had a tacit understanding, he could not say it in public. He had to announce to the outside world that it was caused by a fire.
         As for whether the commoners believed it or not, and whether the news spread or not ... It was none of their business!
         It was enough that the higher-ups believed him.
         Could it be that he was going to fight the White shark Pirates?
         Don't joke around!
         The White shark Pirates had thousands of superpowers, many Sunglow members, and a bunch of three suns members. Unless the entire Army was mobilized, there was no way they could do anything to them at Linjiang.
         He could only hope that when the great white shark Pirates returned, they would no longer have their eyes on the other small towns and cities.
         Otherwise, they would be in big trouble.
          However, when they thought about the Governor-General's Office and some Pirates ... It was fine if the White shark Pirates destroyed a small town, but they probably wouldn't not give them any face and attack a big city. These people were relieved.
         A superhuman and a general were conversing in low voices.
         They were all at the level of sunlight, but not even one of the three suns came.
         Obviously, he didn't have the intention to pursue the invading Pirates, and was just going through the motions.
         In the air, Li Hao glanced around. At this moment, there were still some living people in the town who were hiding in some secret places, but even if the soldiers came, they would be well-hidden.
         Some people were dragged out of the secret passage in their homes by the soldiers, all of them wailing.
         "Sir, please spare our lives ... We don't know anything, we really don't know anything ..."
         "Sir, she's just a child ... Take me away, let the child go ..."
         "Cut the crap. Come out and gather in front. Why are you hiding? I didn't say I'll kill you!"
         The soldiers were extremely fierce. They pushed and kicked, pushing out a group of residents who were lucky enough to escape. Soon, hundreds of residents gathered on a flat ground outside the town.
         As for the soldiers, they were all carrying bags of various sizes. After collecting a pile of items, they quickly walked out.
         More and more places in the town were burning.
         Soon, hundreds of soldiers and more than ten supers gathered together.
         The general and the leader of sunlight were discussing something in a low voice. After a while, the leader's voice was extremely low. "I've found them all. Let's clean them up. I'll use my fire-type powers to turn this place into ashes ... As for the other things in the town ... Shall we split them equally?"
         "Alright! Hurry up, in case the White shark Pirates come back. "
         "That's impossible. The White shark Pirates must have gone to Silver moon's place. It'll be quite a while, how could they be back so soon ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The two of them conversed and soon, they gave orders to the soldiers and superpowers to clear out the remaining residents. Otherwise, if news got out, it would cause some backlash even if they didn't care.
         Since everyone was dead ... They could say whatever they wanted.
         ……
         In the air.
         Li Hao exhaled, suddenly feeling relieved.
         Yes, this was the feeling.  When those women begged for mercy and were afraid, Li Hao was actually in despair.
         However, he later felt that perhaps ... It was because she had long hair but was short-sighted. Furthermore, the people from Silver Moon might have deliberately exaggerated it, making it sound as if the outside world was hell.
         He wanted to believe it, but he was afraid that if he did ... It would be too silly.
         He couldn't even tell what kind of result he wanted to see.
         Would the soldiers and civilians unite to rescue the injured and chase after the Pirates, or would it be like this ...
         It was only at this moment that he saw it and smiled.
         That's good!
         As expected, the outside world was like hell. There was nothing much to say about a family of soldiers and bandits.
         The next moment, Li Hao attacked with his sword!
         Hundreds of sword energies fell instantly!
         Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!
         Like rain, the strongest of the soldiers and supers was just a sunlight. How could they withstand it? in an instant, they were almost all killed by Li Hao. The two sunlight supers did not die, but the leader of the sunlight supers shouted in fear,""Grandpas of the White shark Army, this is for you. We are from the governor's office ..."
         With a bang, the head exploded.
         The other riyao was so scared that he turned around and fled, but he exploded with a bang before he could run five meters.
         The residents were still in a daze.
         At this moment, they knew that they were going to be executed by the bandits. This was not the first time, and it would not be the last time ...
         But all of a sudden, these people died!
         All of a sudden, the residents seemed to come to life. They looked up at the sky. Was it a powerful expert, or ... The White shark Pirates?
         Li Hao didn't say anything, either.
         A ship instantly appeared, and a voice reverberated,""Get on the boat and we'll help you escape. If you stay in Linjiang, you'll die sooner or later!"
         Below, everyone was overjoyed. They knelt down and instantly cried with joy,""Thank you for saving me, immortal ..."
          Li Hao was too lazy to listen.
         There were only a few people left in a town with more than ten thousand people. It was fine to ignore it, but if they didn 't, so many people had died. These people probably had no way to survive.
         He didn't say anything, he just covered the ship and in an instant, everyone was swallowed by the ship, including all the bags that the soldiers had packed up. This was just in time to prevent the swords gate from being overwhelmed.
         That's right, to swords gate.
         Out of sight, out of mind. Li Hao would explode if he were to deal with it himself. He would leave it to Hong Yitang.
         Li Hao suddenly smiled. Hong Yitang ... I'm sorry.
         This was the first time ... Li Hao didn't know if there would be a next time.
         Maybe, maybe not.
         However, as long as there was one, they would send it to the swords gate!
         It couldn't be helped, the swords gate was very experienced. It was said that almost all of the thousands of people in the swords gate were picked up by Hong Yitang ... Now, Li Hao also picked up some of them and sent them to the swords gate. Li Hao didn't have the time to guide and take care of them one by one. He wasn't that kind of person, and he didn't have such experience.
        
         Li Hao turned around and left. The big ship followed him. This giant chariot divine boat could also fly and was quite powerful.
         He had to quickly catch up with Hong Qing and the others and send them over, so as not to make a second trip.
         At this moment, Li Hao's smile was much brighter. He didn't even care about the burning town.
         A dead person could not be resurrected.
         A living person should just continue to live.
         His smile was bright because ... Some things were enough for him to see and understand. The hope in his heart had been completely shattered. Li Hao felt that he had to thank these people for giving him a lesson, a very important lesson.
         ……
         Just as Li Hao was about to send them off ...
         The news was also spreading rapidly.
         Li Hao's group had spread the news in the morning, and by noon, the news had already spread.
          Hou Xiaochen, who was crossing the ocean, suddenly stopped in his tracks as he looked at the words on a jade pendant.
         "Minister ..."
         "It's time to board the ship. Once we board the ship, we'll reach the central region in a few hours ..."Chief Steward Yu reminded him.
         "Look!"
         Hou Xiaochen handed the jade pendant over to chief Yu. When chief Yu saw it, he was also stunned."He ... This guy ..."
         "What do you think?" hou Xiaochen suddenly laughed.
         "This ..."
         "What's he thinking, patrolling the sea area in the middle of the night?"Chief Steward Yu was also in a daze.
         "Minister!"
         In the distance, golden spear seemed to have heard something and quickly stepped forward.""What's wrong with the sea?"
         Chief Steward Yu exhaled,"Li Hao!" This guy led the demon hunt squad to patrol the seas last night, and encountered the White shark Pirates. In one fell swoop, he annihilated two of them, faceless shark and sea shark, as well as more than 500 supers. Furthermore ... He hung the corpses of the pirate ships, and stopped them at the south end. He then spread the word to the White shark Pirates, asking them to wash their necks and wait for him, saying that he wanted to exterminate the White shark Pirates!"
         Jin Jin was stunned, his face filled with disbelief.
         "How ... How is this possible ... The White shark Pirates are powerful. I know about hai Sha. Two years ago, he was at the peak of the three suns realm and managed to escape from me. In less than two years, he has already entered the mid-stage of the rising light realm. I heard that the faceless shark has even reached the late-stage of the rising light realm ..."
         "If he works with that dog, it's possible," hou Xiaochen laughed. I just didn't expect that as soon as I left, this guy actually took the initiative to go and exterminate the bandits. Before this, he was like a stubborn donkey, not moving and retreating, as if I was scheming against him every day ... I didn't have that kind of intention. "
         "This guy is quite interesting. I thought he'd be hiding until the end of time, until Yuan Shuo returned from the central continent ... But I haven't even left yet, and he's already gone to provoke the Pirates ... How F * cking interesting!"
         He shook his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, he was much more talkative. The sadness of parting suddenly disappeared. He wanted to laugh, but he also felt helpless. Li Hao, Oh, Li Hao, you are really ... Very strange!  "Let's go, cross the sea!"
         Hou Xiaochen boarded the ship with a helpless look on his face. The people behind him quickly followed.
         At this moment, the gold spear and Jade supervisor were still in disbelief. Was Li Hao someone who would do such a thing?
         She was really ... So shocked that her jaw dropped.
         According to their thinking, this guy should be hiding in the base and cultivating desperately, not paying attention to what was happening outside. He would only come out when he was strong enough to kill some people. Then, he would continue to hide, cultivate, and scheme ...
         Yes, Li Hao seemed to be like that.
         However, today, the two of them were shocked!
         Hou Xiaochen laughed, and as he laughed, he looked at the churning North Sea and sighed,"The North Sea bandits are strong and powerful. It seems like they have invested a lot in this. This time, they are going to be sad. So many supers have died."
         After sighing for a while, he said,"it's a pity that there's not enough time. Otherwise, I really want to go around and see white shark. I can also send him off ... But ... Forget it. I'll leave him for Li Hao!"
         He laughed and looked across the sea. "Let's go to the central region and play. I'll leave the North Sea for that kid to play with! I think, if Yuan Shuo received the news today, he might ... Be very surprised and break down, hahaha!"
         He laughed out loud, which was completely different from his usual gentle smile.
         Chief Steward Yu gave him a strange look. Even if Li Hao was more high-profile this time and killed many Pirates ... Is there a need for you to smile so happily?
         Hou Xiaochen continued to smile.
         They did not understand!
         As members of the eight great families, and even the only ones who were still alive on the surface, hou Xiaochen and the others who knew some inside information about the eight great families all hoped that Li Hao wouldn't be driven by hatred.
         Unfortunately, the effect had not been good.
          Today, they saw some hope, something that made them happy. This Li Hao might be able to truly inherit the glory of the eight great families. Even if it was the glory of the ancient civilization, they didn't want the dazzling eight great families to become killing machines that only knew how to kill.
         A Great White floated!
         Hou Xiaochen chuckled as he headed south to the central region.
         ……
         At the same time.
         North Sea.
         White shark listened to the reports from his subordinates. After a long time, his expression stiffened. He looked into the distance. Li Hao ...
         That trash hai Sha and that faceless ghost ... Bastard!
         Two pieces of trash!
         The muscles on white shark's face twitched. These two bastards were dead. It wasn't just a matter of being slapped in the face. The key was that the White shark Pirates 'strength had been greatly reduced. If he still didn't do anything, the other seven families might choose to swallow him up very soon!
        
         "Li Hao ... I didn't expect this!"
         White shark exhaled and looked down at the silent crowd. He suddenly shouted,""What are you afraid of? Afraid of being killed by Li Hao? Did he dare to come? There's no need for him to come, I'll go and meet him myself! Li Hao is courting death. After I organize the Army, I'll definitely annihilate that so-called demon hunt squad and take revenge for hai Sha and the others!"
         His top priority was not to find Li Hao. There might be a trap waiting for him.
         I'll first take care of the second and third brother's supers. If I don 't, they'll probably all escape.
         When he learned the situation, he would naturally find an opportunity to find Li Hao. At this moment, he couldn't go rashly. Two xuguangs had died, and he had to find out more about them.
         "Take revenge!"
         Below, the Pirates roared loudly, as if they wanted to shout out the fear in their hearts.
         White shark sighed in his heart. This won't do.
         At the very least, they had to bring back the corpses of hai Sha and the others. Otherwise, they would hang their corpses on the south side as a public display, which would be a huge blow to everyone.
         The White shark Pirates no longer had any dignity to speak of.
          ……
         The news spread all the way South.
         The news spread rapidly.
         The various forces soon received some information. On this day, the name of the demonic sword spread even more.
         Previously, when he fought one against six and killed six three suns, Li Hao had gained a bit of fame and was hailed as the number one Martial Master of Silver moon's new generation. But today, after Li Hao led the demon hunt squad and exterminated the White shark Pirates, massacred hundreds of supers, and hung the corpses of Xu Guang and the other two in public, his fame grew even more.
         On this day, everyone in the country knew about Silver Moon Li Hao and devil sword Li Hao!
         It was no longer the eight great families "successor ...
         ……
         Central region.
         Nanyue province.
         Yuan Shuo was gasping for breath. He had killed an early stage rising light expert, and his face was full of joy. F * ck, I finally killed a rising light expert ... Although he wasn't a member of Crimson Moon, but a trash Yama scoundrel who just had to find trouble ... It was still considered a satisfactory result.
         That disciple of mine killed six three suns more than ten days ago. He's almost as famous as me.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Today, I've killed Xuguang.
         The three suns and the rising sun were separated by a large realm.
         Yuan Shuo laughed so hard that he couldn't close his mouth. He gasped for breath and wiped the blood off his face. He looked at the seriously injured aquamarine light sword not far away and laughed,""You've won, jade light. Well done. That sword just now had the power of the middle stage of the three yang realm. Not bad ..."
         Jadesword didn't want to say anything. She was still injured.
         She was only at the middle stage of the three yang realm ... She didn't have the mood to be proud.
         It was too slow!
         Even though he was much stronger than when she had just left the mountain ... She was still extremely dissatisfied. Yuan Shuo was already able to kill Xuguang, and she was very anxious.
         Yuan Shuo saw through her thoughts and laughed,""Don't worry, we're not in a hurry. Your Azure light sword is not perfect yet. In a few days, you might be able to deal with Xuguang. Just eat more blood deities ..."
         As he said that, a jade pendant in his arms started to vibrate.
         "Big news again?" Yuan Shuo chuckled. Could hou Xiaochen have been ambushed and killed? This is interesting ..."
         This jade pendant wouldn't shake unless it was some big news.
         He took it out and had a look.
         It was just a glance ... A moment later, he put away the jade pendant and smashed the corpse on the ground into pieces with a punch, destroying all the traces left behind.
         Jadesword looked at him and said, "What's wrong? Didn't you say that you wanted to leave a mark so that the world would know that it was you, Yuan Shuo, who killed sunguang here and let the world know your name, five bird King?"
         What a strange old thing!
         You've just deliberately set this up and added many unique traces of the five birds sect to the corpse, afraid that others wouldn't know that you killed Xu Guang. In the blink of an eye, you've destroyed it again.
         "Let's go!"
         Yuan Shuo's face turned livid,"continue South!" What's there to be proud of for killing an early stage rising light realm!"
         "What's wrong?"
         "I'm fine!"
         "Is it related to your disciple?"
         "I don't have a disciple!"
          Jadesword was stunned and dumbfounded.  What was going on?
         You don't have a disciple?
         You've been talking about your last disciple every day. You're just short of saying that your disciple is the number one in the world. What's wrong with you today?
         "He ... He was killed?"
         This was the first thought Jade lightsaber had, and he was a little shaken. Yuan Shuo still held this last disciple in high regard, and if he were to really be killed ... Then Yuan Shuo would probably be the one to go crazy.
         Yuan Shuo walked away quickly and did not even turn his head back. He gritted his teeth and said,""No, he's alive and well!"
         What's the situation with you gritting your teeth?
         Jadesword quickly followed."I'm still injured. Slow down. Tell me, what's the situation?"
         She felt extremely strange. What's wrong?
         Yuan Shuo walked with his head lowered, and as he walked, he suddenly roared,""I'm going to kill a late stage sunguang! No, peak of the rising light realm!"
         You're crazy!
         Jade lightsaber felt that he had gone mad. 'You took half a day to kill an early-stage and you're even injured, yet you still want to kill a late-stage and peak-stage?
         Are you out of your mind?
         "You ... Were you triggered?"
         Yuan Shuo was a little mad,"yes, I've been provoked!" "I taught them with the thought that they would never be as good as me. Even if I said that the student is better than the master, I could forget about it a few years ago. I was crippled and my disciple should have surpassed me. But now ... I've recovered. I've improved rapidly. I killed three suns in a day, and the sun in three months ... F * ck, three months ago, my disciple was still fighting thieves among ordinary people! My disciple just killed a late-stage Sunglow!"
         “……”
         Jadesword's eyes and mouth were wide open, and he was dumbfounded.
         Yuan Shuo was on the verge of tears.
         It wasn't like this!
         F * cking fake news.
         It was definitely fake news.
         What a joke, how could it be so fast?
         I'm an old Martial Master who's fused Five Forces, but my progress is frightening. I've already killed an early stage rising light realm expert, which means that his strength is actually far beyond that of an early stage rising light realm expert. He might even need to reach the middle stage to be able to kill an early stage rising light realm expert.
         However, my disciple killed a late stage sunguang.
         He didn't believe it. It must be fake news.
         It was too infuriating!
         I just killed one and was preparing to let the world feel my might. Good fellow, my might is gone and I have to pretend to be dead. Otherwise, I'll become a joke if this gets out.
         Your disciple has already killed a late-stage Sunglow realm expert, so why are you showing off when you've killed an early-stage Sunglow realm expert?
         Behind him, jadesword was also in a daze for a moment. He looked at Yuan Shuo and said,"You ... Didn't you say that your disciple ... Has only been practicing martial arts for a few months?"
         "Yeah!"
         Jadesword fell silent for a moment before saying,"Your disciple might have been possessed by someone. I've read about this in the ancient books. Hmm, it's probably ..."
         Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes!
         Go to hell!
          It was fine if he scolded them for a while, but when the Jade light sword said that, he was unhappy again,"You know nothing! He has the bloodline of the eight great families, has seen the ancient civilization's heaven-shaking sword, and has also received my five birds technique's true inheritance, so his progress should be fast. You woman, your hair is long but your knowledge is short, what do you know!"
         Jadesword looked at him and cursed in his heart.
         Didn't I just go along with you?
         There must be something wrong with this old man's brain, yet you still protected him!
         Yuan Shuo snorted and cursed a few more times, though it was unknown whether he was cursing at the Jade lightsaber or Li Hao.
         After a long time, he finished scolding and sighed,"no, it's too slow!" "It's too difficult to merge the five Forces, and the strengthening of the five internal organs is too slow. Even if the new technique is effective, the effect won't be shown so quickly ... The people of the red moon have all run away. I don't know where they are ... Let's go, I'll take you to dig a grave!" "I also know the locations of a few ruins. One of them might have a spring of life. I'll Take You There to dig. It's dangerous, but the rewards are greater. I was planning to wait for my disciple to come and take him there, but now you're in luck ... F * ck, he's already surpassed me. Why the hell would I take him there!"
         Jade lightsaber was dumbfounded. You ...... Simply had nothing to say.
         Grave digging ... You should have said so earlier!
         The next moment, the two of them left quickly. Yuan Shuo gritted his teeth. 'Let's not kill anyone for now. If I don't kill a late-stage suguang, I'll be too embarrassed to come out. I'll go dig up a grave and get the water of the spring of life. I'll strengthen my five internal organs and then merge my Five Forces. I'll come out and kill a powerful one and show you guys.'
         It would also let Li Hao know who the real boss was!
        
         (It's the last day of the month, it's a waste not to vote.)
         He went south.
         Li Hao caught up with Hong Qing and the others and took them away with him. Then, he returned with a peace of mind.
         As for how Hong Yitang planned to deal with the hundred or so people ... Li Hao believed that he could handle it.
         It wasn't a lot.
         At most, he could just kill more Pirates and transfer some money over. Wouldn't that solve the problem?
         It's the same if old Hong picks up people himself, and it's the same if I help you pick them up. It'll also save you some time.
         On the journey to the South, Kong Jie had already left. It didn't seem convenient for him to leave white moon City. Before he left, he told Li Hao not to worry too much about the White shark Pirates.
         In fact, Li Hao wasn't too worried.
         ……
          In Nandu city.
         Because today was the demon hunt squad's Day off, Li Hao didn't go into seclusion to train, but instead gave himself a chance to relax.
         In the small Tavern.
         Li Hao sat alone in the highest private room, drinking alone.
         In the past, he didn't drink.
         He secretly drank a little and felt that it was bitter.
         However, after drinking a few times recently, he was a little fascinated. As a Martial Master, he should not drink too much. However, he was only a beginner, so Yuan Shuo did not care how much he drank.
         ,m The wine was not good.  It was bitter. It was as if everyone was suffering in this world. Perhaps they would not starve to death, but the outside world was chaotic and people were panicking. With the rise of superpowers, ordinary people's lives were left behind as if they were charity.
         All living beings suffer.
         Li Hao took a small sip of the bitter wine and looked out of the window. The journey south was still bustling with people. Although it was bitter, he had to survive and find joy in the bitterness.
         In fact, he knew that as long as there was hope and a goal, these people would have a strong life force.
         What he was afraid of was that there was no hope.
         There was still some hope for Silver Moon.
         A book appeared in his hand. It was the five bridges building method. Li Hao started reading the book again. The Golden origin was much stronger than before, and it was still getting stronger.
         Unfortunately, the other three forces were slightly weaker.
         He had no idea about the five Element wood force.
         The four forces already seemed to be unbalanced.
         A small plate of fruits appeared in front of Li Hao. He had exchanged for 20 spirit accumulation fruits.
         Originally, he had wanted to wait for the wood force to gather before consuming it.
         But at this moment, Li Hao couldn't wait any longer. He just had to let nature take its course.  There was no need to be too obsessed with one Dao in martial arts, as all the great Dao led to the heavens.
         The threat of the White shark Pirates was right in front of them.
         From Kong Jie's words, Silver Moon might have made some preparations, but ... Li Hao had his own thoughts. He did not wish for outsiders to interfere if he could. If he could resolve it himself, he would.
         Drinking bitter wine and reading a book, he ate a spirit accumulation fruit.
         A cool and refreshing force entered his body.
         Compared to the heavenly Golden Lotus, its effects were much weaker. Li Hao felt that the improvement he received was not too great, so he did not choose to strengthen his metal force this time.
         Li Hao hoped to strengthen the other three forces so that the four forces could reach a balance.
         He didn't know if seven spirit gathering fruits could be compared to a single petal of the heavenly gold lotus.
         From the exchange rate at the military supplies Department ... It was not possible.
         The sky Gold lotus could be exchanged at the military supplies Department. It required 1000 points to exchange for one, and each petal was worth 125 military credits.
         On the other hand, the spirit accumulation fruit only required 10 military merits.
         The price difference between the two was more than ten times.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, the price wasn't the only thing that mattered.
         Li Hao ate a spirit accumulation fruit and silently felt the strengthening of Shi. There was still a gap between Shi and mental power. Mental power was just a type of pure strength.
         'Momentum', on the other hand, was an even more advanced embryonic form and application of power.
         Li Hao had read a lot of ancient books about the Shi of martial masters. Compared with the cultivation system in those books, the Shi of modern martial masters was a unique new system. It could be said that the Shi of the ancient civilization, which only some people talked about, was applied to the entire ancient and modern cultivation system and expanded.
         The spirit accumulation fruit and wine entered his stomach, and he felt quite good.
         The three forces of fire, earth, and water had all absorbed a little energy. Li Hao sensed that it was not enough to just have powerful energy. Force was not just pure energy, but also a kind of perception and temperament.
         You've seen a lot, you've seen strength, you're proud of your dignity.
         "You're a frog in a well. You've comprehended Shi and absorbed countless energies. In the end, your Shi is just a pure energy.
          Li Hao savored the taste for a while and then continued eating.
         At the same time, he began his own strengthening journey.
         His five internal organs and physical body had to be strengthened to the level of 10000 cubic meters. During the battle with hai Sha, Li Hao had already felt that his opponent could injure his internal organs even with the silver armor.
         At this stage, superpowers were very powerful.
         Even if it was a pure competition of inner strength and superpowers, Li Hao couldn't win against a powerful mid-stage rising light expert. He had been using the bloody blade technique all this time, but as his strength increased, the bloody blade technique's level of improvement declined.
         At the current stage, the fastest way for Li Hao to improve his strength was to nurture wood force.
         After the five Forces fused, there would definitely be a great improvement.
         However, he still didn't have much clue about the Willow catkin sword. Li Hao knew how to use the Willow catkin sword, but he didn't know its essence, so it was naturally difficult for him to comprehend anything.
         Apart from comprehending the wood force of the Willow catkin sword, the second was to strengthen the body.
         The third was the saturated superpower lock. If he could do what Nanquan and the others did, unsealing and then sealing again ... Li Hao could become stronger too, but he needed to reach a limit. He had absorbed a lot of energy before, but he had not reached his limit. The superpower lock was not saturated.
        
         The last way to increase his power...Was to become a demon hunt squad!
         Indeed, demon hunt squads.
         After this battle, Li Hao had already felt that some people's Shi were almost fully formed. He let the demon hunt squads rest for a day, in order to let these people relax.
         The continuous battles had allowed the demon hunt squad members to increase their strength at a very fast pace. At present, all of them had broken through the late 100 stage, but not a single one had broken through to the great circle!
         However, Li Hao realized that these people were even more excited and enthusiastic than when they were fighting the three major organizations. It was obvious that they had their own ideas, especially the people from swords gate.
         If there were no accidents, in a few days, there might be a small batch of people who had broken through the hundred perfection stage.
         Moreover, Li Hao had never allowed anyone to use the ancient weapon of enlightenment before. When everyone returned, he wanted to let them use it, but he had no idea at all. It was not a wise decision to use the ancient weapon of enlightenment.
         However, after gaining some enlightenment, the Enlightenment ancient weapon would be a catalyst.
         These people had all become stronger. One or two of them might not be much.
         However, the ten-ringed mountain-sealing array formed by the 50 of them, with Li Hao as the core, would definitely be able to strengthen Li Hao's inner strength. However, it would depend on whether those people were strong enough.
          Now, it was not too obvious that 50 had broken through 100.
         However, once there were 50 warrior Chilios...That would be a big deal.
         He was reading a book and thinking.
         He also ate many spirit gathering fruits. The sky outside was starting to darken. The day was about to end. This was the second day since hou Xiaochen had left, October 5th.
         On this day, under Wang Ming's arrangement, some of the demon hunt squads went to eat and drink, some went to sing, and some were even taken to some special place by Wang Ming ... In fact, Li Hao could track them down, but he didn't want to care.
         They were both adults and martial masters, and they were both full of vigor. As long as they were willing ... He did not want to care too much.
         After reading the five bridges construction method, Li Hao began to read other things.
         The third book he had brought back the last time was an analysis of basic sword techniques.
         The author of this book ... Li Hao glanced at it and raised his eyebrows. This book was extraordinary. He had never read it before, but now he saw some notes on the page.
         [Editor-in-chief: longevity Swordmaster]
         [Editors: nether King, Prince Hong, director Chen]
         There were only four of them, but Li Hao was a little dazed when he saw them.
         The longevity Swordmaster again!
         As for the other three, they felt ... They were not simple either!
         'There's a King and a Prince. They're probably extraordinary. As for the principal and all these people, they're all nameless. I wonder if they can't be written or if it's a taboo for the venerable one to write. '
         As he flipped through the book, the first line of words already made Li Hao's mind wander.
         "The sword is a sharp weapon for killing. What is at the end of slaughter?"
         What was it?
         Li Hao didn't know, but he vaguely knew a little.
          It's just a basic swordsmanship, what's the point of making it sound so abstruse?  The next sentence made Li Hao's mind wander again.
         "Some people say that it's responsibility, that it's protection, that it's forgiveness ... But wrong, the sword is a weapon of slaughter! To cultivate the sword, one's heart must be pure. First, kill the enemy and cleanse the soul. We'll talk after we've killed them ..."
         "Cough, cough, cough!"
         Li Hao coughed. The first sentence made him think that this was a book that could enlighten people, and the second sentence ... He felt that the authors of this book must have been disdainful, as if they were saying,"why are you thinking so much?"
         The sword was meant to kill.
         As for responsibility and protection, it had nothing to do with swordsmanship. It was all human business. The sword was dead, while human beings were alive. These things were for human beings to think about, not for the sword.
         At this moment, Li Hao suddenly found it very interesting.
         He continued reading.
         These editors all had a profound understanding of sword Dao. Not only did they explain the essence of Sword Art, but they also explained some of the editors 'own unique ideas.
         Li Hao had some understanding of the longevity Swordmaster's swordplay.
         Prince Hong's way of the sword was not explained much in the book. It only briefly explained a few things, such as how the sword was overbearing and open.
         Nether King er ha's sword doctrine was a pure slaughter doctrine. The more he killed, the stronger his killing intent would be. It was like a military sword technique that was suitable for military battles.
         As for principal Chen, he was a little different. The sword was gentle. The book explained that the sword was like a stream, murmuring water. It was weak at first and then strong. The stream was calm and turned into a waterfall, instantly erupting. It was somewhat similar to the concept of the Azure light sword.
         ? First weak, then strong, instantly erupting.
         These experts 'sword principles didn't elaborate much, but their ultimate goal was to kill their enemies.
         ……
         Li Hao ate the spirit accumulation fruit, read a book, and occasionally took a sip.
         It was a book on basic sword techniques, and he was reading it with great interest.
          This book was quite profound. Some things, the more basic they were, the more profound they were. It required extremely profound attainments to elaborate some concepts so that everyone could understand and understand them.
         If Li Hao was given an advanced sword technique, he would be able to understand it.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, he couldn't explain the concept of this Sword Art.
         They did not have enough Foundation.
         How could a beginner have such profound theoretical knowledge?
         However, did learning martial arts also require theory?
         He needed it!
         There were some things in this book that were worth studying and learning.
         This included some special techniques. The same sword, but different angles in different environments, could actually affect the power of the sword. This was the first time Li Hao had heard of such theoretical knowledge.
         Different angles, different postures, and different explosive points would all affect the power of your sword.
        
         Pure speed might not be the ultimate strength.
         Combining this with his own practical experience, Li Hao nodded continuously. His golden sword force was actually extremely fast, and then it exploded ... However, sometimes, you couldn't reach that extreme speed.
         In this case, the explosive power would be slightly weaker.
         He needed to accumulate power.
         And in the book, there was a little special technique, sword nurturing!
         Soldiers were trained for a thousand days to be used in a single moment.
         This soldier could be a soldier, but it could also be a weapon.
         Use your spirit, your will, your qi and blood, your inner strength, and your killing intent to nourish the sword. When you encounter a strong enemy, you must draw the sword and kill them.
         In the book, there were some stories about the longevity Swordmaster. Li Hao had actually read about this in the "battle of Nanjiang". He killed enemies of a higher realm and destroyed a golden body with one sword.
         "Sword nurturing ..."
          Li Hao took out the starry sky sword and fell into deep thought. According to the book, swords were weapons, but they also had thoughts, the thoughts of killing.
         Don't always hide it in the storage ring, don't keep it in your body.
         He just had to wear it.
         "This theory is interesting."
         Li Hao found it quite interesting. The sword could be more powerful if it was nurtured. Would that work?
         Nurturing a sword wasn't that simple.
         Li Hao followed the instructions in the book and poured his qi and blood into the sword, but there was no reaction. However, the book also said that this was a long-term process, so there was no need to rush it.
         Ordinary people could not raise swords.
         As a swordsman, it was impossible for one to not use a sword forever, unless one did not fight. However, if one did not fight ... Then one would not be a swordsman.
         The reason why the longevity Swordmaster did not use his sword for 10 years was because he was injured.
         A true swordsman needed to fight often.
         Li Hao didn't think about this. After a moment of consideration, he merged his sword aura into the small sword. The small sword trembled slightly and let out a soft sword cry, as if it was cheering for joy.
         Then, earth sword force, fire sword force, water sword force ...
         Several sword forms entered the small sword one after another and slowly circulated. Li Hao read a book again. The book didn't mention any sword forms in detail, because the ancient people and the modern people might be different. However, the book said that this was also a kind of polishing for swordsmen.
         "Maintaining the output of vitality and mentality for a long time is also a precise use of your own strength if you can persist.
         That long period of output of sword force should also be a kind of polishing of sword force.
         The small sword flickered in his hand, and several sword stances rotated. Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned slightly. He had no problem holding on for a while, and he could even hold on for a few hours.
         However ... If he spent too much time nurturing the sword, Li Hao was afraid that he would die.
         The sword force consumed too much energy, and it might not be able to recover in a short time.  "It's too difficult to nurture a sword like this!"
         However, since he had seen it and the book had said that the effect was not bad, Li Hao thought about it and decided to give it a try. He would try to raise it first and give up if it didn't work.
         Sword force could also be restored by things like sword energy.
         In addition, Li Hao had never felt that the five viscera contained spirit and nurtured energy. But his teacher said that the five viscera contained spirit. Li Hao knew that he probably hadn't fully understood it. Perhaps the five viscera could nurture energy, but he didn't feel much of it now.
         "It's a pity that my teacher isn't by my side. "
         Li Hao felt a little regretful. The level of spiritual accumulation was suggested by his teacher, but he had advanced too quickly. There were some things that Li Hao had to comprehend by himself.
         Accumulation of spirit ... It definitely wasn't something that his teacher had casually said.
         The five internal organs could definitely be strengthened.
         However, how could he be powerful?
         "Sigh, teacher ... He can't finish his words ... Maybe his theory was not perfect at that time."
         He thought about it and felt that it might be related to the superpower lock.
         At this moment, Li Hao also had his own judgment.
         The superpower lock was a type of sealing of one's potential. As a Martial Master was too strong, their internal organs and physical body would not be strong enough. Thus, they would store some of their excess power and could not release it.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This was the superpower lock!
         The human body itself actually has a force that is sealed within the superpower lock. Teacher's spiritual accumulation should also have the concept of using the superpower lock to cultivate Shi.
         "The accumulation of spirit is a process of unleashing one's potential. It's a gradual process that will strengthen one's five organs while strengthening one's power. This will avoid a lot of trouble, and it might even prevent the same awkward situation as hou Xiaochen and the others, where they have great potential but don't dare to unseal it."
         Li Hao was lost in thought. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that his teacher's path of spirit accumulation was much more complicated than he had imagined!
         It's not that simple!
          His teacher might have had some ideas long ago, but he had put them into practice.
         "Super Lock and force ... Super Lock locked force and force, just to lock it?"
         Li Hao pondered. Locking force might not be used to lock, but to nurture!
         However, how could he release some of the power sealed in the Super Lock to nurture his power?
         Learn from the southern style and break a few?
         That would be too unreliable!
         Many thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind. After reading through the basic sword techniques, Li Hao had many more thoughts about martial arts. In the past, he thought that some of his thoughts about his teacher were simple, but now that he thought about it, he felt that they were profound!
         His spirit accumulation realm wasn't as simple as he had thought.
         Of course ... Yuan Shuo himself might not have perfected it.
         "Forget it. My teacher is nowhere to be found. His theory might not be perfect. Maybe ... I can try to supplement and perfect it myself."
