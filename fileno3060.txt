Wang Ming and the others were a little puzzled. Li Hao smiled and said,"The new martial Swordmaster!"Everyone was shocked!Was this the neo martial Swordmaster? p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This person's name was like thunder piercing the ears.At this moment, Li Hao regained his calmness. He laughed, looked at the cultivators in the sky, and said,""Go back and make preparations for the next few days! I'll be staying at Silver Moon for a while on this trip. Silver Moon will soon welcome a huge change! The world is strengthening, the great Dao is strengthening, and the great Dao universe is appearing!""The Dao is right in front of us!""The Silvermoon people can't isolate themselves forever. Sooner or later, they'll walk out, walk out of the world, walk out of the heavens and earth!""It's very dangerous outside, but it's also very exciting!""The battle between venerable sovereigns resulted in the death of venerable sovereigns and the destruction of worlds. A world like the Silvermoon could be easily broken. Once broken, the realm would be destroyed, and billions of lives would be exterminated ...""As a Silvermoon citizen, there's nothing to be afraid of, but ... You can't be ignorant and fearless!"These words seemed to be said for everyone to hear, but also seemed to be said for himself, and also seemed to be said for young people like Liu Yin.At this moment, Liu Yin, who had recovered his combat strength, was a little nervous.Ignorant and fearless?Venerable sovereigns?Marchioness Silvermoon!He ... How powerful was he?He couldn't help it. Even when he saw his father staring at him, he still couldn't help but quickly say,""Marchioness Silvermoon, I ..."Li Hao looked at him, and Liu Yin became a little nervous for no reason. He swallowed his saliva and said,""I'm ... I'm Liu Long's son ...""I know," Li Hao smiled.Liu Yin heaved a sigh of relief."I ... I want to ask, what ... What exactly is a venerable sovereign like?"Although he could feel it, it was not obvious.There was no direct understanding!What exactly was a venerable sovereign like?What kind of person could be considered a venerable sovereign?At this moment, Li Hao sensed that many people were wondering what a venerable sovereign was like.It had been 500 years, and there were many new people.There had been a battle between venerable sovereigns in the past, but now ... They would never see each other again. Not to mention a battle between venerable sovereigns, even a battle between Dao integration stage cultivators had almost never broken out again.What was a venerable sovereign like?Li Hao smiled."Do you want to know? Do you guys want to know?"He seemed to be looking at everyone in the world. At this moment, the billions of people seemed to feel that Marchioness Silvermoon was looking at them.Some were nervous, some were apprehensive, some were looking forward to it, and some ... Were doubtful.How powerful were venerable sovereigns? How much stronger was it than the Dao integration stage?What was a venerable sovereign?Li Hao laughed. Ignorance was bliss. The people of the Silver Moon today were indeed not as knowledgeable as they had been in the past, even though they had more experts now than when Li Hao had risen to power.But at that time, Li Hao had seen the apparition of the venerable sword, the blood Emperor splitting the Silver Moon, and the human King slaughtering the people.Therefore, when he was very weak, he knew that there would always be someone better.He had never been lacking in knowledge.However, the current Silvermoon citizens were truly inexperienced.He laughed. At this moment, perhaps he was showing off, or perhaps he was trying to let these people understand that if they were ignorant, they should increase their knowledge. His voice spread out,"Someone asked me what a venerable sovereign was like. Then I'll tell everyone ... What a venerable sovereign is like!"At this moment, he suddenly turned into a 10000-Zhang giant and was still growing. A huge hand instantly covered the sky and the sun. The entire world was being stretched by the huge hand!The Silver Moon was huge!After becoming an intermediate world, it was even bigger. However, at this moment, the huge hand covered the sky and earth. It continued to spread and gradually spread from one end of the Stargate to the other.On his hand, the lines were clear, as if the great Dao had transformed into hand patterns.Countless people looked up at the sky with their mouths wide open and their jaws dropping!They only saw that the sky was suddenly covered!In the next moment, a universe seemed to have appeared. In the universe, a star appeared. The star was extremely small. At this moment, a giant reached out his palm near the star and wrapped it.Li Hao's voice resounded, Silver Moon, a middle-level world! Ten billion lives ... That was the lowest level of existence in a medium-level world! As a venerable sovereign, I can grasp it with a single hand. The Dao domain will appear, encompassing the entire Silver Moon. With a single thought, the life and death of the Silver Moon will be in my hands!"With a wave of his hand, dozens of stars suddenly appeared in the surroundings.Every star seemed to be no smaller than the Silver Moon. Li Hao said,""This is another world. There are small worlds ... Not smaller than the Silver Moon. It's too abrupt for the Silver Moon to advance to the middle stage. There are also medium-grade worlds that are bigger than the Silver Moon!""These worlds can be found everywhere in the chaos. They can be destroyed at any time. These are the spoils of war we obtained after destroying the four major worlds!"BOOM!With a casual squeeze, a world exploded. Li Hao instantly captured the power of the world and fused it into the Silver Moon world. The Silver Moon instantly expanded greatly, and the boundary wall began to expand. The world began to expand ... Under the shocked and dazed gazes of countless people, Li Hao looked at Liu Yin in front of him and chuckled.""This ... Is a venerable sovereign!"The venerable sovereigns behind him were speechless.Go to hell!Are you trying to scare a child?It was true that this was a venerable sovereign, but one had to add a premise. This was a venerable sovereign who could rival a peak sixth-rank venerable sovereign, a venerable sovereign with a Dao domain, and a venerable sovereign who could destroy a medium-level world on his own!A true first level venerable sovereign was able to grasp a medium-level world with one hand?What a joke!Li Hao, you're just scaring people!At this moment, not only were the young people dumbfounded, but the cultivators of the older generation were also dumbfounded. They had seen venerable sovereigns before. In the past, Li Hao's battle with venerable sovereign Shi Gu and the others had caused a great commotion and was so powerful that they could blow up a city with one move!

Chapter 3061 The Return Of The Rich (3)
But ... What was a city worth?Above the cities were the provinces, each with dozens of cities. Above the provinces were more than 100 provinces, which were the Silver Moon land. They had seen the venerable sovereigns break through a city and turn it into nothing in an instant.However ... They had never seen someone who could wrap the entire world with one hand!It was as if the world would be destroyed with a casual squeeze.At this moment, Liu Yin was extremely stunned. He tilted his head and looked at his father."Blow us to death in one breath?"Father ... You ... Have overestimated us?Did he need to take a breath?Do you really need to blow us to death in one breath?This was a venerable sovereign?In his eyes, his ninth-level Dao integration father was already terrifyingly powerful ... But ... But ... What was he?In front of venerable sovereigns, he would probably be blown to death in one breath, right?His father also said that in the past, Marchioness Silvermoon had reached the ninth level of the Dao integration realm and killed a venerable sovereign ... Was this a joke?Or could it be that his father remembered wrongly and the Marchioness Silvermoon was at the 99th level of the Dao integration realm instead of the ninth level?At this moment, the world fell silent for a moment.In the next moment, the sound of a tsunami resounded through the Silver Moon."Lord Marquis is invincible!""Lord Marquis is peerless!"“……”The whistling sound went from ten million people to a hundred million people, to a billion, to ten billion ...The entire Silver Moon was howling madly.There was shock, fear, terror, excitement, and madness ...This was a venerable sovereign?Liu Yin, who was in front of him, went from fear, shock, and fear to apprehension and excitement in the next moment. As he watched the whistling sound sweep through the world, he could not help but whisper,""The Marquis is invincible ..."Liu Long turned his head and looked at him, speechless.Usually, this son of his really made him feel extremely helpless. He couldn't even control him. He was unruly and thought that he was invincible. Today ... He was just saying that the Marchioness of Silvermoon was really that powerful?Good Lord, now you've changed your attitude?Do you want face?You're a disgrace to the Liu family!However, he was also shocked. What level had Li Hao reached?He was definitely not an ordinary venerable sovereign!They knew that Li Hao had just reached the venerable sovereign level. Although they didn't participate in the battle, they had watched Qian Wuliang and the others fight.It definitely wasn't that scary!Casually crushing a world?You must be joking! Back then, even silver Moon had not advanced, and bone Emperor could not even blow him up, so how could he be so powerful?Li Hao's voice rose again."I'm just a junior in the chaos. Five hundred years in the Silver Moon is only a few months in the chaos!" "Of course, I'm not an ordinary venerable sovereign. There are nine ranks of venerable sovereigns in the chaos realm, and I'm a fifth rank venerable sovereign! Above that is the sixth rank, which is slightly stronger than me, but not by much ... Above that, the seventh rank venerable sovereign is ten times stronger than an ordinary sixth rank venerable sovereign!"Li Hao's voice reverberated through the world,'a seventh rank venerable sovereign is the true Lord of the World, the Overlord of chaos! Level eight venerable sovereigns were the top existences in the chaos realm. Only level nine ... Could be called invincible! "Before I returned, eight seventh rank venerable sovereigns died in the chaos. Before that, a group of seventh rank venerable sovereigns also died, an eighth rank venerable sovereign was almost blown up, and hundreds of ordinary venerable sovereigns died. Corpses were strewn all over the place, and blood flowed like a river. Venerable sovereigns fell like rain. This is the chaos!" “……”All four directions were shaken.What?The Marquis was only at the fifth rank?Above that, it was fine if a Tier 6 was stronger than the Marquis, but a tier 7 ... Was more than ten times stronger?Hundreds of venerable sovereigns would die at once?Is this a joke?All of the Silvermoon people were stunned. At this moment, Hong Yitang couldn't help but send a message,""This ... That's too scary. It's not good, right?"He knew that Li Hao was trying to scare them and make the Silver Moon people know their place.But ... It's really scary to hear you say that.A venerable sovereign who could casually destroy a world could kill hundreds of them at once ... How terrifying was this chaos?"I lied?"No!But ...Hong Yitang was speechless. Why didn't you tell me how the hundreds of venerable sovereigns died? p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Who killed him?Also, how did so many tier 7 experts die?If one were to really calculate, neo martial and silver Moon were both disasters. So many seventh rank venerable sovereigns had died. It could be said that it was either neo martial or Silver Moon who had done it.Many venerable sovereigns had fallen in the chaos for so many years.However, if so many of them died at once, Li Hao, the human King, and the Supreme-being would be the real disaster.At this moment, the entire Silver Moon started to recover from the shock and turned into a fanatical state.Venerable sovereigns were so powerful!As for Marchioness Silvermoon, a fifth level venerable sovereign, it didn't sound like much ... However, it was still ridiculously strong. Moreover, Marchioness Silvermoon was still young.It was said that only a few months had passed in the primordial chaos.At such a young age, he was already at the fifth rank. Wasn't the ninth rank something that would happen sooner or later?At this very moment, Silver moon's previous uneasiness and restlessness ... Were instantly gone. In the face of absolute power, there was no such thing as being restless.An existence that could single-handedly destroy the world ... Are you going to fight against him?Do you think that the other party would really care about the position of Marchioness Silvermoon?Would he really care about being the Overlord of this small world?In the past, he always felt that the knowledge he learned about Marchioness Silvermoon was a bit exaggerated!Only today did he realize ... What was going on with the Silvermoon people?Did the people who created the teaching materials know how to boast?If you don't know, then shut up!According to the information they provided, venerable sovereigns were very powerful. They could destroy a city with one punch ... Bah!In the past, he thought that it was an exaggeration!Now, he felt that ... The person who formulated the teaching materials was definitely using his feet to formulate them. He was not a strong person at all. Otherwise, how could he have confused venerable sovereigns with city-breaking powerhouses?

Chapter 3062 The Return Of The Rich (3)
Today, everyone finally understood what a venerable sovereign was.This was a venerable sovereign!Of course, if they had really advanced to venerable sovereign, they would find that ... Nonsense, venerable sovereigns were not that powerful.As for Li Hao, he seemed to feel that it wasn't enough. He laughed heartily. "I've been in the chaos for many years and made many friends. There's a tier 7 neo martial sword venerable who was also the king of the previous generation of Silver Moon! There's the type 7 Sen LAN sector Lord, the type 7 Li Zhu Emperor, and also the close to Type 7 type 8 Emperor's son Kong Ji...With the help of these friends, I've taken down an abandoned type 9 world!""Previously, many rank seven venerable sovereigns died here ... In the end, everyone gave me face and was willing to help. They were willing to lend tianfang's rank nine world to me, the Silvermoon people. I'm not very knowledgeable and have no great abilities ... Now, I can go to the rank nine world and see the real situation. It's not bad to see the abandoned rank nine world and increase my knowledge!""That's why I opened the Stargate today. I hope that if there are wise people in the realm who are willing to walk out of the Silver Moon, they can walk out in a few days ... And go to tianfang world to take a look! Now, a large number of venerable sovereigns have migrated away, and countless cultivators will be relocated ... In a few days, after the level of rank eight venerable sovereigns, the Crown Prince of the divine light realm will be empty and will soon destroy the entire world ... Which is to turn the world into a dead zone. As for tianfang world, it's tens of times the size of my Silvermoon world, and this is just an abandoned world ..."He was dumbstruck!There was too much information about this.Marchioness Silvermoon seemed to have good relations with people in the primordial chaos. She had friends everywhere, and they were all rank seven and rank eight friends. Everyone gave her face and helped her seize a rank nine world.And today, a country bumpkin like silver Moon seemed to have the opportunity to go take a look at a rank nine world ... Even if it was abandoned, according to the Marquis, it was still very impressive.There were a large number of experts.At that moment, countless cultivators were excited.This ... Was this true?The elders sighed even more. That's right. In the past, every time the Marquis spoke, he would give out benefits. Today, it was the same. Even if they hadn't seen each other for 500 years, the Marquis still seemed to be doing well in the chaos!A fifth stage venerable sovereign could actually befriend so many top experts.As expected of the Marquis!……He displayed his strength and calmed the Restless Silver Moon.At this moment, Li Hao revealed a smile. He glanced at Liu Yin and the other young people ... Fine, strictly speaking, they were all older than him, but ... Li Hao felt that he was really old.These people looked big, but in fact, they were too young.He was young!"You've seen the strength of venerable sovereigns. Nephew Gu, what do you think?"Venerable the sword was stunned. He glanced at Li Hao. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Where did you learn this mantra?Of all things to learn, he had to learn from the human King!But ... It didn't seem ... Wrong!If he didn't shout like this, how could he?Liu Long was the boss of Li Hao's team back then, as well as a subordinate later on. He had been following Li Hao all this time and was even older than Li Hao. If Li Hao didn't call him nephew, should he call him brother?But ...Forget it! Venerable the sword was helpless.One should not learn from the human King. Fang ping had to raise his status in front of everyone. When he saw the celestial pole, he had to call him nephew ... Because he was of the same generation as the Western Emperor.At this moment, Liu Yin no longer had the slightest bit of arrogance to speak of. He hurriedly nodded."Strong, ridiculously strong! I'm a frog at the bottom of a well, looking at the sky from the bottom of a well!""But ... But if my father and the others had told us earlier," he couldn't help but say,"venerable sovereigns are so strong ... We ..."We don't believe it either!Wasn't this just being ignorant?He couldn't help but ask again,'back then ... It was said that there was already recording equipment, so why ... Didn't you record some images of the venerable sovereigns? If that's the case, perhaps we ... Won't be so foolish!"Only now did he realize how foolish he was.Liu Long and the others were speechless.An image?Who's recording?Record who?There were some who recorded it, but it was all dark history. It was a serious battle, who had the time to record it? besides, your father wasn't even a Heavenly King at that time. Venerable sovereigns were fighting in the chaos, where could I record it?Li Hao smiled and looked at everyone."Alright, let's not talk about this anymore. Let's go and find a place to sit down. We'll wait for a while and see who else from Silver Moon will return ... This time, I'm going to upgrade the entire Silver Moon. Even if it doesn't become a great world, it must become a Tier 6 world!"Of course, it was very difficult.However, if he didn't try, who would know?From Tier 4 to Tier 6, at most, he would just burn money.In the chaos, the other medium-level worlds can't afford to burn, but I, Li Hao, can.He would upgrade the world first. As for the Dao universe, he was not in a hurry. It was actually much easier to upgrade the world power. When the Dao net was more complete, the world power would be richer, and the world origin would be richer. The world would naturally upgrade.At that time, Black Panther, this sector Lord, would be able to gain the upper hand.Perhaps, he could surpass the master of the great Dao and become a sixth-tier first. ……Silver Moon marquisate.This group of people, some from outside, some from Silver moon's group, and some from Silver moon's group, were all gathered together.Director Zhao was shocked by Li Hao's experience.They had joined forces to destroy a seventh-tier great cosmos, destroy an eighth-tier great cosmos, blow up the Crimson Moon universe, and turn the Lord of the Crimson Moon into an itinerant cultivator ...A few months felt much more interesting than his own five hundred years.Silver Moon did not actually have much to say over the past five hundred years.

Chapter 3063 The Return Of The Rich (3)
It was just developing step by step!They had made some progress in martial arts, but ... Compared to Li Hao, they were not worth mentioning.The biggest change was the absorption of more neo martial civilizations.The illiterates were gone, and the Academy was filled with them. Martial arts had become an existence that everyone could come into contact with, know, and understand.They were living better and their lives were more convenient.Some of the plans that neo martial had left behind at the beginning included the development of communication, the development of roads, the improvement of infrastructure, the appearance of skyscrapers ...These things were developing quite well.As for the others ... They were Silver Moon, who had only had a few Dao integration experts in the past 500 years. Now, they were everywhere. Li Hao, however, had obtained a lot of resources in exchange, all of which were transported from level 8 worlds of light.It was enough to support an average mid-tier world.As for Li Hao, he had given all of them to Silver Moon. As of now, there were no less than a hundred thousand Dao integration stage cultivators in Silver Moon, at least a million in Sun Moon, and even more in the mountains and seas.Of the older generation, only the mountains and seas had survived!As for the exact amount, it was uncountable!At this moment, director Zhao felt a little guilty and helpless,""After that, the resources were running out ... Some of the old people actually had the chance to advance, but ... We still gave up on providing them with resources. We chose the best of the best, and many people ... Died of old age just like that!""Moreover, if we were to let loose on our cultivation, there would be more daomerge cultivators ... But the daomerge cost too much. In the later stages, we had to reduce our daomerge resources, and ... We even had to sit by and watch as some of us began to fight each other."He sighed.There were some things ... That he indulged in.For example, killing!There were too many cultivators, and there were not enough resources. There were also too many strong people. There were no enemies. At this time, some people's mentality changed. Some fighting happened. He actually knew about it, but he didn't care and deliberately indulged it.Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many cultivators.If he did not restrict them any further, the new generation would have no chance at all. They would lose all their resources, and his lack of action had earned him plenty of scolding in Silver Moon."I understand!" Li Hao nodded.He didn't say much and just shook his head,""There's no need to blame yourself. A completely sealed world with fixed resources, no external enemies, and to maintain peace ... To be honest, I don't even know what to do. If you force me ... I'll fish for justice and kill a group of them first!"This was a helpless move. It was actually very difficult for those who stayed behind to make a choice.Once a woman's benevolence was shown, the entire world might be in chaos.  Otherwise, they would all fall into a deep sleep like neo martial.He was waiting for the day the Stargate opened.Director Zhao sighed."Now that you're back, we're at ease. However, it seems like the outside world ... Is not peaceful. I feel that there's no need for you to waste too many resources on Silver Moon. From the very beginning, Silver Moon has been relying on you. You've raised so many people, and so many resources. If you cultivate on your own, you might reach Tier 6 or 7 ... It's enough to let everyone see the world; what's the point of wasting them?"Li Hao smiled and shook his head."You can't say that. For me, the stronger I am, the greater the consumption. These resources aren't enough for me to enter Level 7. It won't affect me much if I enter Level 6!""But once Silvermoon becomes a major world, things will be different! Besides, Qian Wuliang, senior uncle Hong, Hongyu, Heibao, and the others all played a key role in this trip. I used to think about traveling alone, but I realized that I can't travel without friends and helpers. ""No matter how strong an expert is, if he's alone, he'll still be surrounded and killed!""Silvermoon has great potential!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao continued,"the two Dao universes are only one of them. The second is that the Silvermoon world has the ability to grow on its own! For the past 500 years, the Silver Moon has been in the great Dao universe without any energy. I've taken a look, and it has actually expanded quite a bit ... This is a place without any energy!"It was still unbelievable.The Silver Moon was just like what the human King had said. It was extraordinary. The place where time was carried was indeed different."If Silvermoon reaches level six ... If even two Dao universes can become level six great Dao universes ... Perhaps, with a small amount of resources, an existence comparable to Level Seven can be born!"He looked at Hong Yitang and the others and smiled.""With two sixth-tier great Dao Masters, one sixth-tier world Lord, and three sixth-tier Masters, I don't think it'll be difficult for them to fight a seventh-tier master with the Silver Moon!"In that case, Silver Moon himself would have the battle prowess of the seventh step.For Li Hao, it was worth it!The moment he said that, director Zhao had no more objections,""It's fine as long as you think it's worth it. I just want to say ... If silver Moon becomes a burden, that's not the original intention of the Silver Moon people!"Li Hao nodded,"I understand!" This time, I hope that all of you can become venerable sovereigns. It's difficult to even enter the primal Chaos realm without becoming a venerable sovereign. If Silvermoon can become a rank six world, an ordinary rank six world can accommodate thirty to forty venerable sovereigns. I, Silvermoon, will have double that number!"Two-Dao universe!Take neo martial for example. Neo martial was only at Level Seven. Other Level Seven Worlds could accommodate fifty to sixty venerable sovereigns. There were definitely more venerable sovereigns in neo martial!Why?Yin and yang dual DAOs!This was still under the condition that there was some imbalance. Otherwise, it could accommodate even more."It's actually a good thing that Silver Moon has lived for 500 years. It gives everyone some time to digest their experiences. Of course, there are also benefits to going out. Nan Quan and the others have entered Tian Fang and witnessed the battle between rank seven and rank eight venerable sovereigns ... There are many venerable sovereigns in Tian Fang, and Dao integration realm cultivators can easily grab them ... In addition, Tian Fang's world power is quite rich and has sufficient energy ... It's not a loss."

Chapter 3064 The Return Of The Rich (3)_6
It was hard to tell who was good and who was bad.The prerequisite was that Silver Moon had sufficient resources. Otherwise, it would be useless even after five hundred years.Those who had gone out were the ones who had truly gained knowledge. They were not as easily fooled as the Silvermoon people, who had thought that a random rank five venerable Emperor could easily destroy a medium-level world.Each had its own advantages and disadvantages.However, some of the people who were out there had not reached the ninth level of the Dao integration realm yet. The ninth level of the Dao integration realm was the peak of the Heavenly King realm, and those who cultivated the Dao of illusion and reality were half-step sovereigns.p Many of the people who had left earlier were only at the fourth or sixth level of the Dao integration realm.In just a few months, he might not have crossed the threshold of the seventh stage.Director Zhao hesitated for a moment before asking,""Did anyone who went out die?"Li Hao shook his head."I'm not sure yet. Qian Wuliang and senior uncle Hong haven't gone to the universe of Dao yet. We should know after a careful examination. It doesn't matter if they die. They can just be resurrected!"It was easy to say, and in fact, it was easy.It wasn't like a venerable sovereign had died!It was just a group of Saints and Heavenly Kings. He had been able to do it in the past, let alone now.It was a very simple matter!As long as the core of the Dao universe wasn't broken, it would be fine. Of course, if the core was broken, the Dao universe would be destroyed ... Li Hao wouldn't have the ability to revive it.This time, someone had died, but Li Hao didn't even need to trouble himself. Of the two Dao Masters, one was a level-four venerable sovereign, and the other was almost a venerable sovereign. Resurrecting a few Heavenly Kings and Saints was a simple task.Of course, there would be some consumption and even a lightning tribulation ... So it shouldn't be too powerful.Li Hao didn't chat for long. He said,""Let's make some preparations before everyone returns. After 500 years, some people are about to starve to death ..."He wasn't really hungry. He was just too short of energy.Li Hao continued,"I'll merge the Dao crystal into the world and the Dao universe first ... When the others come back, I'll show you. Dao, enlightenment! The Dao that was forcefully improved was unstable! I'll tear the world apart dozens of times and show you what the Dao, the Dao net, and the Dao domain are ..."These were the essence of Dao!He wanted them to know what it meant to weave and merge DAOs ...This kind of understanding was similar to the inheritance of Dao chess. Dao chess was not intuitive, but Li Hao would show them a more intuitive view. Of course, this way, they would have less understanding.But ... What did it matter?Could everyone reach the seventh rank?That's impossible!Li Hao didn't even have such an idea. He only hoped that everyone would have some understanding of Dao, even if they could reach level six. Those who were truly talented would understand it themselves sooner or later.This time, it was not just Silver moon's group of people, but also a group of people who had joined new martial. Zhang an had become a venerable sovereign, but li Fuhai, Hong shanmu, general Huai, turtle Guardian, and the ninth Division commander, who had joined Li Hao in the past ...This batch of neo martial artists included some students from Yuanping martial arts university, heaven battling Army ...He would provide some help to these people.Previously, he was too busy and lacked resources. This time, he really didn't lack any!He had gained too much from the four worlds. Moreover, he had killed two level 7s, but no one else wanted it. In fact, Li Hao wanted to give the power of the great Dao in the deep sea to venerable Lord Wushan, but Wushan didn't want it.With so many resources, it was enough!It was normal for some venerable sovereigns to be born this time.It all depended on how many venerable sovereigns would be born. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  With more venerable sovereigns, the two path Masters would also become stronger. Just like the Supreme neo martial artists, the people would be strong, and he would be strong. There were too many Supreme neo martial artists. Li Hao would even believe that the Supreme neo martial artist had entered level eight before the human King.The way of the people was not very reasonable. Of course, the premise was that he could control it and not lose control.However, there were some restrictions on the people Dao. After killing all the Silver Moon people, the Dao master would collapse no matter how strong he was. On the red moon master's side, a few rank 7s had died, causing him to suppress it every day. In the end, he couldn't suppress it anymore and had to leave.This was the price. This was still considered good as the fusion wasn't too deep. Otherwise, he would have died from the backlash.Li Hao didn't reminisce too much with them.After chatting for a while, they started to prepare.A large number of Dao crystals dissipated in the dual-Dao universe like they were free, almost filling the entire universe. The world power was also crazily extracted by him to strengthen the entire Silver Moon world.The Silver Moon was growing at a speed visible to the naked eye.The Silver Moon, which had almost become an empty shell, had instantly become a Holy Land for cultivation. Countless people were madly absorbing the power of great DAOs and the power of the world. Over the years, the energy had been exhausted, so many people could not cultivate at all.Some newborns couldn't sense the existence of energy at all, just like Li Hao in the past.In the entire Silver Moon, a large number of cultivators began to advance.Their advancement also began to feedback to the great Dao universe.The two Dao Masters who had left the Dao universe earlier opened their Dao universe, just like when Li Hao was here. They opened their Dao universe, allowing the power of ten thousand DAOs to spread, allowing people to walk freely in the Dao universe.This was only silver moon's fault. Li Hao had done this before. Qian Wuliang had unconditionally carried out Li Hao's policy. As for Hong Yitang, he had always thought that he was only taking control of the Dao universe in Li Hao's place, so he wouldn't set up too many obstacles.As a result, Silver Moon, which had been sealed for 500 years, erupted in a frenzy within a few days.A large number of cultivators began to advance!As for the other cultivators who had been wandering around, they also started to return. Southern Fist, Northern fist, sky sword, BA Dao, hou Xiaochen, Yao si, radiant sword ...A large number of Silver Moon martial masters began to return, and many neo martial artists also returned.There were also people who died in tianfang...But they weren't afraid of death, as they could be resurrected.What was more terrifying was that the two Dao Masters had reported that someone ... Had walked out of the Outlander domain. He had left the Outlander domain. Beyond the Outlander domain was the primordial chaos. Most importantly, the person who had left the Outlander domain had not died!This was the biggest surprise. Someone had actually left tianfang world. What the hell? tianfang is so big, isn't it enough for you to run?What are you running for!However, he couldn't help but sigh. He was really bold. He was not a venerable sovereign, but he dared to leave tianfang universe and enter the primal Chaos directly ... He was either accompanied by a venerable sovereign or ... He was really not afraid of death.Li Hao had originally thought that the southern Fist gang had a chance. After all, they were very bold.Li Hao was speechless when Hong Yitang said two names with complicated feelings."The king of the Li Dynasty and the Queen of the West?""Right!"Hong Yitang nodded and said,"it's them!" Although they haven't completely cultivated my Dao of Silver Moon, they've both opened their Dao meridians and have some connection ... Right now, it's very weak. They're clearly far away!"Li Hao was helpless. After a long time, he said,"it's fine as long as he's not dead. I didn't expect the king of Dali to be so bold. I also didn't expect the Queen of the West to think that Tian Fang isn't enough for her to harm. Where did she go to harm others?"I feel sorry for the world. The Queen of the West is a jinx!Li Hao still thought so.Whichever world she went to, she might be in trouble.He didn't know which unlucky person took the other party away, or if the other party took the initiative to follow him ... Anyway, these two people were probably in the world and not the chaos. If they had been in the chaos for so long, they would have died long ago if they were not venerable sovereigns!"AI!"Sighing, he shook his head. He originally wanted to help these two advance, but these two were the true half-step sovereigns. It seemed like he didn't need them anymore.What a pity!

Chapter 3065 The Great Leap Of The Silver Moon
The key to returning to Silver Moon was still to improve it and allow it to grow.An infinite isolation wouldn't change anything.It would only limit Silver moon's growth.Unless ... You really don't care about money and can support tens of billions of cultivators on your own. In that case, it's nothing.Of course, the sealing of the little realm could also be seen as a time secret realm, as long as one wasn't afraid of the unlimited consumption of lifespan.However, it was still useful for those below venerable sovereign level. Once one reached the venerable sovereign level, they would not be able to come into contact with chaos. No matter how many resources they had, it would be difficult for them to comprehend the great Dao.There was a limit to the great DAOs in small realms.At this moment, Li Hao wasn't in a hurry to let people enter Tian Fang. Going to Tian Fang at this stage might not yield much.……After everyone returned, Li Hao entered the great Dao universe that belonged to Silver Moon.Behind him, there were people everywhere.It wasn't just the Silvermoon people, even Empyrean terminus, solitary, and the others were all present.Everyone was finally here.Behind them, there were some Silver Moon people who stayed behind, as well as some of the new generation. Li Hao wasn't familiar with them, so he let director Zhao choose a few. As for their moral conduct, Li Hao didn't ask. As long as director Zhao felt they were good, it was fine.Previously, he had seized the four great worlds and obtained many small worlds and medium worlds.Dozens of worlds could fill up Li Hao's own world, but to him, advancing from level five to level six required a lot of resources. These dozens of worlds might not be able to help him complete the advancement ... Almost impossible.Since that was the case, he was too lazy to absorb the power of the world.The cultivators stood behind Li Hao.There were venerable sovereigns and a large number of non-venerable sovereigns.Li Hao looked around and saw that almost everyone was present ...After thinking for a while, it seemed that he was still missing one person.Li Hao suddenly thought of something. He smiled and stretched out his hand. The hand extended from the Silver Moon and continued to extend into the tianfang boundary.Suddenly, in a Palace that was about to be abandoned, someone's expression changed slightly."It's me!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The giant pincers were shocked!Soon, everything returned to normal. It was the Silver Moon King.In the next moment, the huge hand grabbed down and instantly grabbed him into the void chaos.……Very quickly, the giant pincer was thrown into the crowd. The giant pincer was shocked. Where was this? In the past few days, Tian Fang had been sending out a notice that everyone had to leave. Venerable sovereigns would leave by themselves, and the rest who were not venerable sovereigns would be relocated at any time. He had also made preparations to leave.Of course, he knew that Tian Fang had been taken down by the Silver Moon King and the others.However, the current Silver Moon King was only in contact with advanced venerable sovereigns, so he didn't dare to approach him. Although Silver Moon King had promised him that he would help him when he wanted to become a venerable sovereign, he still didn't dare to.But ... Who knew if the other party still remembered, or if he took it seriously?He didn't expect that he would be suddenly captured here today.This ... Also seemed to be a great Dao universe.Tian Fang?No, a not-so-powerful great Dao universe. This was ... The Silver Moon great Dao universe. Then, the people nearby were all the so-called Silver Moon people?He was full of doubts, but it was not appropriate for him to ask.The others were also curious, but they didn't say anything. They were all waiting for something.Seeing this, the giant pincers did not dare to say anything. They could only look at Li Hao in silence.Li Hao thought for a while and said,""Four rank seven venerable sovereigns. If your true bodies can't come, you can send your will here. Although you're either the Lords of Dao domains or great DAOs ... It'll be helpful to have more references."He wanted to tear down the world!A lot of demolition!p It required the use of time. Not everyone could display or see how the Dao net was formed. Li Hao had a natural advantage in this regard.Otherwise, even the Dao net of a small world would not be easy to tear apart.This time, Li Hao had also completed the use of time. He probably couldn't take it anymore after this. It didn't matter if one person looked at it or if many people looked at it. Unless he was too weak to understand it, he would show everyone what he could see.A moment later, the void flickered.Four shadows descended.Both sector Lord Wu Shan and Sen LAN were curious. This was their first time entering Silver moon's great Dao universe. Sword Saint had been here once before. Although it was Li Zhu's first time here, he didn't feel too curious after taking a look. In fact, he had some understanding of Silver Moon."Two Dao universes?"Although he had known before, at this moment, Wu Shan was still a little surprised and shocked. He really saw it. Two long rivers of the great path appeared and surrounded the void. The two paths were distributed like the Tai Chi.Sector Lord Sen LAN was even more surprised.He controlled the Dao universe and naturally knew what the Dao universe was. It was somewhat unbelievable that the Silver Moon had actually formed two Dao universes."Today, I'm going to split up all the seized worlds ... There's no difference in size between worlds. As long as there's a world, there must be a Dao net. Even a large world has a Dao net. The Dao net of a large world forms a sphere and forms the second universe within the realm ... The great Dao universe!""There are a few key points in the formation of a world. First, the origin of the world given by chaos! Second, the net of great DAOs! "Third, a perfect net of great DAOs forms a great Dao universe, which is a great world!""We can't artificially create the origin of the world, so we can't artificially create the world. Even if we create the world and the great Dao universe ... This isn't called the great Dao universe, it's called the Dao domain!"

Chapter 3066 The Great Leap Of The Silver Moon
"Sword Saint, senior Wushan, and senior Lizhu all formed Dao domains. The forest great Dao that is connected to the world is the great Dao universe!"This time, Li Hao connected and divided the world, the universe of DAOs, and the origin of the world."You may think differently from me ... You may think that it's just my own idea, and that's true. However, I have time. I can go back in time and see what's true and what's false. This may be the only Foundation that I, Li Hao, have to be bold and arrogant in front of you!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This was because he could see the past and the formation process of the Dao web. Although he had yet to see the formation process of the great world and universe, Li Hao felt that his deduction was not wrong.Flowing time?Wu Shan knew about it, but Sen LAN didn 't. Hearing that, The Phantom was a little bit shaken.The power of time?Go back to the past?Li Hao turned around and looked at the others."You can remember what I said, but you don't need to understand too much. This is something that only venerable sovereigns, or even sixth-rank venerable sovereigns, need to understand and know!" He said. "As for all of you, cultivate a Dao ... When I tear apart the Dao net, there must be a similar Dao. Every world must have a basic great Dao!""What you need to do is to comprehend the Dao I dismantled. The same Dao, even the same Dao, will have some differences in different worlds ... This is Dao enlightenment!""It's not time for you to leave Silver Moon yet. If there comes a day when you want to leave Silver Moon ... You can consider the circumstances. Those with merits can leave, and those without merits can also leave after paying off the energy they need to take with them! Silver Moon will not force anyone to stay!"Everyone was silent.Li Hao didn't say much. He just saw the situation in Wushan and thought of the situation in new martial arts ... So, he mentioned that he was not the master of the great Dao, but the two masters of the great Dao nodded at this moment.90% of the Silvermoon universe's current achievements were thanks to Li Hao."The great Dao universe is a layer of filtering nets ... In fact, the Dao nets of the small and medium-sized worlds are also filtering nets. However, because there are fewer great DAOs, the filtering effect is not as good as the great Dao universes. This causes the DAOs of the small and medium-sized worlds to be somewhat chaotic and mixed. However, they are better than pure itinerant cultivators!""Pure rogue cultivators below venerable sovereign can hardly establish themselves in the chaos because the Dao of chaos is too chaotic!"At this point, Li Hao suddenly shook the river. Yuan Shuo, who had been in seclusion and felt that he was about to step into the venerable sovereign level, suddenly opened his eyes and flew into a rage!Li Hao ignored him and continued,"if a cultivator wants to reach a higher level, it's best to lay his own Dao net from the moment he becomes a venerable sovereign. A Dao net is the foundation of a Dao domain. On this Foundation, he can continuously improve it until he reaches Level Seven. Then, he will form a complete, sealed Dao net that can be logically self-adapted and can cycle repeatedly without any conflicts. The core Dao can surround the Dao domain. If such a Dao net is successfully built, you will be the master of Level Seven!""Of course, they're rogue cultivators!""The Lord of a great world. The world has given birth to a great Dao universe ... That has naturally formed a complete Dao net. At that time, you only need to grasp the core Dao source!" The seventh rank venerable sovereigns also wanted to ask something.Li Hao looked at them."Cultivation is about communication. If you think I'm wrong, you can tell me.""I don't think you're wrong. According to what you're saying, rogue cultivators have a more complete Dao than the Lords of Grand DAOs?""Not really. I'm talking about those who entered the seventh-rank by themselves, not those who broke away from the Dao universe.""So you're saying that I'm actually inferior to the master of the great Dao, right?" monarch Wushan couldn't help but ask.“……”Li Hao didn't say much, but that was what he meant.Rogue cultivators were different from one another.He thought for a while and said,"the level Seven itinerant cultivators I mentioned can be divided into two types. Those who break away from the Dao universe are only because their Dao strength has reached a certain level. The other type is when they enter Level Seven on their own. This is when their Dao domain is perfected ..."Wushan was speechless. "Can't you just use me and the two people beside me as examples?""I'm a Dao master who has already inherited a perfect Dao universe. At this stage, it seems that I can only rely on devouring to become stronger, right?"monarch Senlan said."No!"Li Hao shook his head."Devouring isn't the goal. The accumulation of energy in the great Dao universe isn't the goal either. Otherwise, why don't you absorb hundreds or thousands of venerable sovereigns?" This was because ... Devouring other great Dao universes could perfect one's own Dao net. Great Dao universes and Dao nets were different from each other. From two aspects, one was strength! Second, quantity!",m "I've observed it. Under normal circumstances, a Dao net of a small world or a medium world would require two to three thousand great DAOs to form. A medium world would require three to four thousand at most ... As for a level Seven venerable sovereign, he would need to form a Dao domain or a great Dao universe ... In my opinion, he would need at least four thousand great DAOs.""Based on the number of great DAOs in the Dao net, the weakest rank seven venerable sovereign would have at least 3000 great DAOs ... Of course, there are some powerful great DAOs that are more powerful than many, and they might be able to have fewer ..."Quantity and strength?Sector Lord Sen LAN could be considered the inheritor, the inheritor of the Dao universe. His comprehension of the Dao wasn't that strong. At this moment, he had the most doubts.Li Hao was young, but he had seen many things.

Chapter 3067 The Great Leap Of The Silver Moon
He had seen many seventh level venerable sovereigns 'DAOs, been to Dao chess, watched venerable sword and Li Zhu prove their DAOs, observed the formation of their Dao net, helped the restoration of Wushan, broke through the Crimson Moon, and even went to the other three great worlds and universes.Sector Lord Sen Lan's knowledge and experience wasn't as much as his."Then," Sen LAN said,"our Dao universe has been perfected. How can we add it in?""Weaving ... Tearing apart a part, fusing another part, comprehending a new part, and re-weaving some great DAOs. With one more Dao, one has to weave once ... As for devouring other great Dao universes, it's actually also a process of reorganization. It's just that this process is often not clear to you."Sector Lord Sen LAN nodded, he didn't ask any further as he understood.Dao was very mysterious.However, what Li Hao described was not that mysterious, because he could see and touch it. Therefore, the extremely mysterious Dao was like a net in his mouth, casually woven.This was something that the other venerable sovereigns did not have.The others were listening attentively. Even Yuan Shuo, who had just been woken up, was listening attentively and no longer angry.It didn't matter if they understood or not ... In fact, Li Hao was very straightforward and they could understand him. It was just that they hadn't seen it yet, and they hadn't reached that stage yet, so they didn't have a direct feeling. However, Li Hao's words didn't have the so-called profoundness of the great Dao.​ They all understood!"That's all the logic, but you still have to comprehend the Dao yourself. If you can't comprehend it, it's useless to understand the theory. If you don't know a new Dao, how can you weave it in?"At this moment, Li Hao waved his hand. The worlds were compressed and presented in the universe of Dao."Today, I'll tear down the road! You can merge with the Silver Moon, the world, or the river of great DAOs. You can comprehend it yourself ... You can also directly merge with it. However, if you merge with it, other people's DAOs will ultimately belong to others, not you. In the future, there may be some obstacles. "Venerable the sword nodded. This was somewhat similar to neo martial arts 'path of extinction. It could also be incorporated by others. However, if one took another person's path, it would still have a great impact on one's future.At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything. His small world began to expand infinitely.Everyone was instantly sucked into the world.A star appeared in Li Hao's hand. It was the time star!With a stomp of his foot, the soil and sand in the world were all shattered and turned into dust. The entire world suddenly became an empty shell made of energy and a heart-like World origin."Other than these external objects, this is the outline of the world. The source of the world, its energy, and the Dao net that you can't see!""I can turn back time to the time after the birth of the world ... Not before the birth. The birth of the origin of the world is the biggest secret of chaos. I can't turn back time, or I won't be able to hold on!""I will go back to the time when the first great Dao was born ... And then, other great DAOs will gradually appear and form a Dao net ... This process is what I want to show everyone."Everyone nodded their heads continuously. This was already very impressive. However, Lin Hongyu was a little worried.""You've been using time frequently ...""I've reached my limit in this life!"Li Hao didn't say much. He didn't care if he used time.Lin Hongyu didn't say anything else, but she was a little worried. This meant that Li Hao was about to pass on his fourth life, which was not a good thing.In the next moment, time began to reverse.At first, no one could see the Dao net. However, a few rank-7s could actually see some vague structures of the great Dao, but they could not distinguish them clearly. However, under the turning back of time, they saw it.He saw the great DAOs disappear in an instant. Gradually, the entire world seemed to be left with only the origin of the world.Then, a great Dao appeared out of thin air.The Dao of earth!This also meant that the first Dao to be born in this world was the Dao of earth.Then, great DAOs began to appear and construct a net of great DAOs. The process was simple, but it took countless years to form a perfect small world.In the end, the Dao net wrapped around the entire world. After a quick count, there were about 2000 Dao nets.Everyone watched silently. Now, they were only watching and had yet to do anything.The next moment, Li Hao said,"everyone, step forward and distribute them in an orderly manner according to what you saw earlier. Each of you will choose a Dao. Later, you will split them up according to the order. Whether you want to merge the Dao you split into the Silver Moon, absorb it, or do something else, it's up to you!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "However, remember one thing. Don't get the order wrong. Also ... This is also a kind of weaving technique. This is stable and actually represents a kind of orthodoxy ... This kind of order can make the entire Dao web stable. There are many orders, but it doesn't mean that any random order will work. Everyone can think about why this arrangement can succeed ..."The crowd looked at each other. They were a little excited and nervous.Can we ... Also do it personally?Such an opportunity was hard to come by."Hurry up! There are many worlds to be demolished today!"At this moment, everyone began to spread out around the world according to the DAOs they were familiar with and the DAOs they had observed before. Li Hao also displayed the Dao net again. The power of time was exerted to the extreme at this moment.This was the real time!Above Li Hao's head, dark clouds appeared, but they were quickly covered up by Li Hao's daylight thief.

Chapter 3068 The Great Leap Of The Silver Moon
It was just a small world, and it had not yet reached the stage of breaking through the sky-stealing sun-shifting technique.For the first time, everyone seemed to have clearly touched the great Dao ... Someone couldn't help but ask,""Why is it that I can't touch or even sense it normally, but now I can even touch Dao? Does the Dao also have a physical body?""Of course, Dao has a physical body ... An illusionary physical body may seem contradictory, but it's actually not contradictory. Dao is also a kind of energy! It's just that you don't usually cultivate this Dao, so you can't clearly feel it. Today, the power of time has manifested 10000 DAOs ... This means that time may actually be a combination of 10000 DAOs!"Everyone was stunned.Li Hao didn't care too much. That was the truth.He had already guessed it.The Dao of space was perhaps formed from 9999 Dao laws. This was the master of tianfang. If there was one more ... Would it be time?Was time an independent entity, or was it the true collection of all DAOs?Li Hao needed to consider this, but it was a matter that was extremely distant.It was only today that Li Hao clearly understood how difficult it was for Shi Guang to achieve great success. It was so difficult that he had already done a good job. He might have spent his entire life working hard to become the true master of time.And now, his time was only an embryonic form.No one asked any more questions. They all touched the main road. Li Hao looked at them and said,""Begin extracting. Who was in charge of the last great Dao? now, wrap it with your own great Dao power and extract carefully. Don't panic. Once you panic, the entire Dao net will collapse!""If there are any other DAOs that no one else can control, and if you think you can control them, you can try to dismantle them ... Seniors, you can also try ...""Senior celestial pole, you go too!" He roared.“……”In the distance, Tian Ji was stunned. He was very relaxed at the moment. Seeing Li Hao shout at him, he couldn't help but say helplessly,""There's nothing here that matches the Dao I wield ...."Li Hao was speechless."Then try to comprehend the DAOs that others don 't. I'm not asking you to fight. You need some Foundation to lie down. When everyone becomes a seventh level venerable sovereign, you'll be easily killed. How can you lie down without strength?"It seemed to make sense.But ... Seventh level ... Everyone is seventh level?You must be kidding me!Helplessly, Heaven's Fate could only step forward.Li Hao glanced at the others. Many of them were very nervous. Some of the new generation of Silver Moon were even sweating. Other than the Silver Moon people, the new martial artists who had joined previously, including some students from Yuanping martial arts university, were also quite nervous.To be honest, they had never experienced tearing down the world.Even the human King did not let everyone experience it.It was because the human Emperor...It was unknown whether it was because he could not, or he was disdainful, or he did not have the time, but in any case, he had never done such a thing as splitting up the great Dao.Compared to the human King's Own strength, Li Hao would explain it to the weaker ones when he had time. It was very rare!"Qian Wuliang, let's start with you!"The Dao that was formed in this small world was an illusionary realm. At this moment, Qian Wuliang was in charge of it, and he wanted to try all kinds of DAOs.At this moment, after hearing Li Hao's words, he began to dismantle it carefully.He would use his own great Dao power and great Dao Comprehension to wrap this Dao, absorb some of the comprehensions, and tear it apart. The Dao of the Dao net could not be torn apart by force.It was just a Dao in a small world. Even he, the master of a fourth-rank great Dao, was a little nervous. He was afraid that he would be the first to make a mistake, and that would be very troublesome.Very quickly, the First Main Road was successfully demolished.Qian Wuliang didn't say much. After comprehending for a while, he directly stuffed the Dao into his chaos River, which was his.The others proceeded in an orderly manner.The first few people had it relatively smooth.In the new generation, Liu Yin's Dao was at the forefront. It could be considered the Dao of spearmanship. Just as it was exposed ... With a crack, the great Dao seemed to have collapsed. In an instant, the entire Dao network began to collapse! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Liu Long's expression changed greatly!His son ... Had failed to remove it.After all, there were still many people waiting behind his son. In the end, when it was his son's turn, he had only opened a few pieces and had actually failed!The new generation did not seem to have a clearer understanding of the Dao than the older generation.Liu Yin's expression also changed drastically!The Dao of spear collapsed immediately. There were many cultivators who practiced the spear. This time, golden spear and the others were giving way to him and letting him control it. It was the Dao he was most familiar with. However, he failed not long after!It would have been fine if he had only taken one, but he had failed, causing the rest of the Dao net to start collapsing!The power of the great DAOs instantly mixed together.It was even about to explode! As for Li Hao, he didn't say anything. He just reached out and grabbed, and the power of countless great DAOs enveloped him, suppressing the chaotic power of great DAOs and not giving it a chance to explode. He glanced at Liu Yin, whose face was filled with despair.Seeing Li Hao looking at him, he was extremely dejected and a little afraid.""I ... I ..."Li Hao looked at him for a long time, then slowly said,""It's fine. It's just a small world. It's no big deal even if the Dao net explodes. There are still many opportunities later on!"At this point, he smiled and said,"young man, you're lacking in comprehension. It's fine as long as you know it. There's no need to be embarrassed! I'll give you a mission ...... You don't need to participate anymore. However, I'll give you an even more important mission. "

Chapter 3069 The Great Leap Of The Silver Moon
Liu Yin was extremely dejected. What other important mission was there?"In this place, 2000 great DAOs are mixed together ... It's very difficult for you to extract the power of the spear Dao that just exploded from this! However, if you can do it, you'll gain far more than just tearing down a path!""The others who are not confident in mastering the great Dao can try with Liu Yin ... Of course, you may not be able to reap any rewards. I'm not too optimistic about whether you can extract it, but if you succeed ... The rewards will be far greater than now!""Can you strip it off?" Liu Yin's eyes flickered and he asked hurriedly."Yes, but it's very difficult ... Do you want to try?""I ... I'll try!"Li Hao nodded and smiled,"young man, be more aggressive!" If you're young and not impetuous, are you still considered young?"At this moment, everyone seemed to have forgotten that this guy was not that old.Li Hao ignored them and looked at Kong Ji.""When they are done, you can destroy this world and try to revive it. Consider it a Foundation for the Nirvana heavenly square. We can't waste it. We have to play with this world and stuff the last bit of energy into the Silvermoon great Dao universe!"Kong Ji nodded his head and sighed.In the past, everyone would eat a small world raw. Good Lord, Li Hao was making use of it multiple times in the true sense. He did not waste anything at all.This included the source of the world. It could be destroyed and devoured by the Silvermoon world. It could also be fed to the two cats.The chaotic power of great DAOs was stuffed into the Dao universe, allowing it to slowly purify.At the same time, Li Hao said,"in addition, I've also developed a new Dao. It's one of the Dao meridians. You can learn it. It's not too difficult. It's a Dao of purification. This time, you'll have to absorb some chaotic Dao ...""Forget it!" Kong Ji couldn't help but say."I didn't ask you to learn it!"Li Hao was speechless, why forget it? "The Dao of purification is very useful, especially the giant pincer. You can learn it well. Although you don't have a Dao Meridian and aren't a Silvermoon person, when you reach the level of a half-step Emperor, you can learn the great Dao if you adapt a little!"Everyone was puzzled. What Dao was so powerful?The point was, why didn't Kong Ji let everyone learn it?Soon, Li Hao began to teach his new Dao. According to Li Hao, this Dao was the way to heaven!The name was very Grand!According to Li Hao's teaching method, although they couldn't clearly comprehend it, it wasn't too difficult to cultivate according to the cultivation technique. It wasn't a problem to simply comprehend it since they didn't seek the great Dao to become a venerable sovereign.At that moment, the seventh rank venerable sovereigns were the first to learn it.In just a moment ... The few illusory images of the sword Saint froze. They seemed to have sensed something was about to happen and quickly chose to stop their cultivation.They could stop, but the others didn't have the chance.In just an instant ... Puchi!Puchi!In an instant, the entire Dao universe was suddenly filled with a loud noise. The stench was overwhelming. Some people's stench was much lighter, while others ... Were so strong that it made people want to vomit.Li Hao was already prepared for this. He isolated himself and looked at the crowd. Finally, he looked at some ladies and sighed, shaking his head."You have no image at all!"“……”Everyone cursed in their hearts!At this moment, they were all looking at each other with red faces. This ... Was too embarrassing.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked at another person and asked in confusion,""Hou bu, do you have that many impurities in your body? Take care of your body. I've taken a look, and a dark cloud has formed over your side ..."Hou Xiaochen couldn't hold it in any longer. He glared at Li Hao with a cold face.Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded."You were injured in the past, and you've been weak and sickly since you were a child. Your condition hasn't improved since then, and you keep coughing. It's not an impurity, but a deposited pathogen ... It's stinky even more than a giant pincer! It's been hard on you, secret Yu, to be able to hold it in. "On the side, Yu Luosha didn't say a word. She just ... Glanced at hou Xiaochen. That was really ... Really stinky!She almost couldn't hold it in anymore.Of course, when he thought about how he had been like that just now ... His face and ears instantly turned red. It was as if he had returned to the past when he was young, and he no longer looked like he was 1500 years old.Li Hao ignored everyone's murderous gazes and continued,""This method is very useful! To be honest, most people don't even have the chance to learn it. Although it's a little unsightly, it's really effective. If someone can cultivate it to the extreme and have no impurities in his body ... At that time, he'll be as white as Jade and as clear as immortal Jade ... This is the Dao of Immortals!"At this moment, even venerable the sword couldn't help but ask,""If an immortal cultivates this kind of Dao to become an immortal ... Then forget it!""You can't say that, uncle li," Li Hao said with a smile,"there's no distinction between noble and lowly Daoist ..." "But it's a smelly fragrance!"Venerable the sword was speechless.
