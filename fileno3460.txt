"Don't forget about this great enemy!"Yuan Shuo reminded. This guy was far more difficult to deal with than Samsara! If this opportunity is right, I even suggest that we join forces with neo martial and even pull the extreme Ice realm over. It would be best to annihilate long Zhan and the others!"Long Zhan not caring about Li Hao and the others was raising a Tiger that would bring trouble.In fact, it was the same for Li Hao. If he didn't deal with long Zhan and the others at this moment, he would only be raising a Tiger."It's not easy to deal with them," Wu Shan said in a deep voice."We sent out eight level eight venerable sovereigns, but we couldn't take them down. Instead, one of them was killed ... If we join forces with neo martial, we'll have a lot of strong people ... But once a full-scale battle breaks out, we'll be surrounded by enemies from all sides ... It'll only be a lose-lose situation for both sides!"Yuan Shuo nodded."I know this. Therefore, we have scruples. Long Zhan will also have scruples. In that case, if we can extract the chaotic power of the square domain, then we will!" At the very least, we have to weaken the cultivation environment of the four-sided domain to prevent them from giving birth to more experts. This time, we've killed a rank eight and many rank seven experts, so I'm worried that they'll be able to give birth to a rank eight venerable sovereign ... It's very difficult for chaos beasts to advance in rank, but the other party has several peak rank seven experts under their command, such as that Qing Qiu venerable sovereign ..."If this dragged on, it would be even more difficult to deal with the other party if a few more grade-8 experts were born.Li Hao didn't want to go to the four-sided domain, but his teacher's words made sense.Since the enmity between them was so deep ... It would be better to weaken the other party a little."You're right ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and said,'that's fine. I'll go to the four-sided domain to merge with the Dao! Moreover, the separation of the lightning territory will also prevent some external troubles. If the commotion is too big, it will attract the attention of the three overlords. If they really cross the void to come here, it will be extremely dangerous for me!"If he went to the four regions, even if he attracted the attention of the three overlords, they might not come.Even if they came, even if they had a great enmity with long Zhan, at that time, long Zhan would have to find a way to expel the three overlords and join forces with new martial arts and silver Moon to resist together. Otherwise, if these Overlord powerhouses were allowed to enter the four-sided domain, they were likely to face a disaster."That's right," the Thunder monarch said."The myriad transformations Emperor is here ... Do you want to meet him now?""There's no rush for now!"Li Hao shook his head."I'll fuse the Dao of chaos first. We can talk about it after the fusion is successful. Otherwise, it's meaningless!""It's better to do it earlier ..."Li Hao said,"then let's make a trip to neo martial and call a few tier 8 powerhouses ... It's just a deterrence. A battle might not break out. Long Zhan is a guy who can endure. He only extracted some chaos power. He also knows that it may not be a good thing to have a conflict with us ..."After saying that, Li Hao suddenly smiled and said,"let's go near Tian Fang!" Tian Fang ... I think he's about to recover, but extracting some chaos power can slow down the speed of Tian Fang's recovery. Tian Fang's recovery now might not be a good thing, and it might benefit long Zhan. "With a decision made, everyone did not delay any longer.Li Hao's river of time swept over and disappeared without a trace. The river of time appeared and he left in the air.He didn't know where neo martial was at the moment, but it was enough that he knew where the celestial pole was.It was easy to find new martial arts.……The nine Heavens.The Supreme martial artists were also cultivating and digesting what they had learned. Now, a few more seventh level venerable sovereigns had been born in new martial arts, and their strength had soared again. All of a sudden, the Supreme martial artist sensed something. In an instant, several level eight Supreme martial artists appeared.At this moment, the human King's injuries were almost completely healed. One had to admit that even though he was heavily injured, to him, it was as though it was nothing out of the ordinary. He recovered very quickly, and his ability to withstand attacks was unbelievably strong.When Li Hao appeared, the human King, Supreme-being, and the others were a little confused.Why did this guy come here of his own accord?"Seniors, there's a matter that I'm afraid I'll have to trouble all of you to help me with.""Speak!"The human King didn't beat around the bush and said directly,"other than myself, you can do whatever you want with the rest. Whoever you beat up is ..."Li Hao laughed and shook his head."It might not be a battle. I want to go to the four-sided domain and cultivate. It might cause a big commotion and attract long Zhan's attention. With a few seniors here, we can have a good talk. If not, it'll be safer.""Go to the square region?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The human King touched his chin."Last time, long Zhan gave me three major worlds and told me to get lost. I took the benefits and also said that I would get lost until Tian Fang recovers ..."He could be considered to have kept his promise.After thinking for a while, he smiled and said,"how about this? old Zhang and the rest and I will wander around the vicinity of the Thunder region a few times ... If long Zhan doesn't find trouble, we won't go in! If he's looking for trouble, and he's the one looking for trouble ... We'll go in and kill him! "This way, it won't be considered breaking a promise. I, Fang ping, have always been a man of my words ..."The surrounding neo martial Supreme emperors all looked at him.Are you sure?​ You're good to your own people, but you don't take anything you say seriously to your enemies!He was probably too embarrassed to reveal his true nature in front of a junior like Li Hao.He had to make up for it!As for the Supreme martial artist, he was slightly suspicious and doubtful."Going to the four-way domain to cultivate ... Is to open the heaven domain?""That's not the case. ""I've been lacking a lot of chaotic force and great Dao force to cultivate," Li Hao explained."I want to merge with the chaos great Dao and connect with it directly ..."The venerable sovereigns on the other side were stunned.Even the Grandmaster couldn't help but look at him for a while. After a long time, he said, "I've actually thought about it a few years ago!"Obviously, he knew the problem and difficulty of this.

Chapter 3461 Dao Merging Chaos (3)_6
"You're very young and confident. It's normal for you to think that you can handle it!" New martial arts also paid attention to the creation of death as long as one didn't die! It's just that if we stagnate even a little, it could be a big problem ... We didn't do it back then, but our choice was still correct. If we did, we might have exploded because we didn't have enough Yang Qi!"He looked at Li Hao and muttered,"if you've considered this, we naturally won't say anything. I'm sure you've weighed the pros and cons. Besides, there's another point. The chaos great Dao, I mean, the real chaos great Dao, is very chaotic and disorderly ... Currently, a large number of level nine venerable sovereigns have disappeared. It may be related to the chaos great Dao! You'd better take this into consideration as well. All level nine venerable sovereigns are trying to build an orderly world and the orderly great Dao ... Will the chaos great Dao have any conflicts with them?"Li Hao nodded thoughtfully.""I know, but ... What I'm trying to do now is to turn disorder into order. If the chaos great Dao is the key to disorder, then it's even more important to integrate it. If you don't go deep into it, how will you understand?"The Grandmaster laughed."Then I have nothing to say. If you have a sense of propriety and have this idea, then do as you wish!" "Fang ping, I, and the rest are coordinating around the Thunder region. Long Zhan is a smart person. He will not rashly make a move against us. This time, there's a high chance that we'll just be meeting each other ..."Li Hao laughed."That's also because you seniors are strong and can deter us. Otherwise, long Zhan would have killed me with one punch long ago!"This time, there was a high chance that they would just meet each other, or at most, say something harsh to each other.The probability of a war breaking out was not high.p But this also required confidence. Otherwise, long Zhan was not someone to be slaughtered by others. He would have long flipped out."Then it's better to go earlier than later, let's go!"The Supreme martial artist didn't say anything else. He didn't find Li Hao's choice too inconceivable.He had actually considered this path before.In the end, he gave up.In the past, the yin and yang of the new martial arts were imbalanced and a group of people were stuck at a level. He was the same. Once he really walked the chaos Dao, he would explode. Now that he had reached level eight, he was not too willing to go.Although he was still lacking in the power of a great Dao, it wasn't as powerful as Li Hao 's.The group of people were very straightforward. Since they had made a decision, they did not delay.Li Hao directly activated the river of time and located the human King and the Supreme-being near the Thunder region. He wasn't curious at all, or rather, even if he was, he maintained the dignity of an elder and didn't look carefully.On the other hand, the light Emperor couldn't help but take a few more glances.This thing was quite rare!It was similar to the teleportation of the universe of the great path, but it was more hidden.Kong Ji, who was standing at the side, felt a little embarrassed. His father was already so old, and he might be the oldest here, but his curiosity was even more direct than a group of young people. It was really embarrassing.……Along the way, they only chatted casually for a while. When they arrived near the Thunder region, the few level eight human King realm cultivators chose to stay and did not venture deeper.Li Hao, on the other hand, led Wu Shan and the others through the lightning zone and headed straight for the square zone.……Four regions.Tianfang world.The Dragon Lord had been here all this while. Even when the enemies attacked and were repelled, he would return to this place.Tian Fang had recently shown signs of recovery. This time, he was really going to recover.He had been waiting all this time.Capturing the master of the sky Square's will, and even taking away some of the master of the sky Square's power of desire ... These were all things that he had been preparing for.He was very bold!But right at this moment, suddenly, long Zhan furrowed his brows and turned his head to look outside.A moment later, a massive ripple of energy spread out in all directions, and all of the primal Chaos energy in the four-sided domain began to madly surge.Li Hao arrived nearby, but he didn't prepare anything at all.He immediately began to fuse with the Dao!With the Queen in front of him, Li Hao knew the specific process and method. The difficulty didn't lie in the Dao integration, but in the surging chaotic force after the Dao integration!At this moment, long Zhan sensed it.His expression changed slightly and became slightly gloomy.The originally unstable tianfang world suddenly began to lose large amounts of Primal Chaos energy and great Dao energy.At this moment, a pair of eyes seemed to appear in Tian Fang universe and look at Tian Fang ... Clearly, Li Hao's fusion with the chaos Dao this time seemed to have touched the heart of the master of Tian Fang.The large amount of energy that Tian Fang had just gathered was lost again.In the depths of the Dao universe.One of the stars seemed to have a pair of eyes, watching silently. No one knew what his emotions were. ……And long Zhan disappeared rapidly.The level eight venerable sovereigns also quickly disappeared.Outside of tianfang world.Not too far away.A group of people surrounded Li Hao. At this moment, endless chaotic force swept toward them, and the entire chaotic world seemed to be on a rampage!Long Zhan appeared.He looked at the crowd in the distance and sighed,""Li Hao, why didn't you stay in the East? why did you return to the square domain? just to absorb the chaotic force and fuse with the Dao of chaos, do you have to fight me to the death?"Li Hao remained silent.At this moment, giant Beasts of Chaos quickly appeared. The moment they saw Li Hao, the level eight Black Tiger's eyes turned crazy and bloody!Li Hao!As for the Dragon Lord, he glanced at Li Hao with anger in his eyes, but it quickly dissipated. He looked around and soon, several auras of the eighth step seemed to appear in the distance.The human King, the Paragon, light, and Emperor Cang were all here!In addition, there were a few level eights here ...This group of people really had guts!However, his strength was indeed powerful.From afar, the voice of the human King reverberated through the void, shaking the heavens and earth. He laughed,""Old dragon, I didn't come in. You've given me three great worlds, and I, Fang ping, have kept my promise! But ... Don't take the initiative to pick a fight with me, or else, I won't be breaking my promise!"Long Zhan took a deep look at Li Hao, and then looked at the others. After a long time, he chuckled."It seems that even you feel that the cultivation method of the chaos race is the true and Orthodox one! It's a good thing, but Li Hao, you're quite bold to have completely fused with chaos, but be careful of getting burned when you play with fire ..."He chuckled and did not say anything else. He waved his hand and disappeared with the experts who were unwilling to give up.This was not the time to fight with this group of people.This group of people had established themselves in the East and was his barrier. If a conflict really broke out, it would not be a good thing. As for Li Hao, who had extracted a large amount of chaotic force, and even the recovery of Tian Fang's side might be delayed, he was bound to be unhappy. But at this moment, long Zhan suppressed his unhappiness.He was only thinking about whether it would do more harm than good if he completely integrated with the chaos great Dao, or if the benefits would outweigh the harm.Could he ... Give it a try?As the strongest expert of the chaos race, he was actually half-dependent on the chaos great Dao. Now, a human was trying to fuse with the Dao. It seemed that Li Hao felt that there were benefits to fusing with it.But ...He raised his head and looked at the sky, at the boundless chaos. Was the great Dao of chaos without order or order?Would Li Hao's actions cause some trouble?Previously, someone on Li Hao's side had fused with it, but it had been very weak. Now, Li Hao had already reached Level Seven, and he still dared to completely fuse with it ... He would have to bear the consequences!……At the same time.Deep in the chaos.At the place where the countless statues stood, at this moment, the statues opened their eyes one by one. It was no longer just one or two, but many of them. In their eyes, the scene of the distant four regions appeared.After an unknown period of time, someone's voice rang out,""Tian Fang ..."  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  One of the statues did not wait for the other party to finish speaking and slowly interrupted,""I know!""It's good that you know. When will the Tian Fang monarchs return?""We're almost there,"The person who asked the question didn't say anything.The four-direction region was Tian Fang's territory. Since he knew about it, there was no need to say anything more.At this moment, the image of the square domain appeared in the eyes of the huge statue. Li Hao's face even appeared in its eyes. After a long time, it closed its eyes. The emperors of tianfang should have returned soon.These young people, each one more reckless than the other.If this went on, who knew what kind of trouble would happen.Dao integration chaos ... Chaos was without order and boundless. One had to be careful not to reap what one sowed. This person seemed to be that time Dao cultivator. It would be a pity if he died.

Chapter 3462 A Different Perspective (1)
The Dao fused with the chaos.Rivers fused into the chaos, a thousand worlds fused into the chaos, Time and Stars fused into the chaos ... This was the Dao-fusing.The moment it fused, the river surged, and countless Primal Chaos energy gathered.At this moment, Li Hao's consciousness seemed to have completely dissipated, or rather, he had turned into a part of the chaos. He seemed to be floating outside the chaos and overlooking the entire chaotic void.At this moment ... He saw eyes!One pair after another!Someone was looking at him!There was more than one person.At this moment, he even saw some things that he couldn't see in the past. He saw countless DAOs and a passageway?Was it a passageway?He did not know.He seemed to have seen a great Dao hidden in the chaos. Was it a space transmission channel?Was it Tian Fang?The master of tianfang had left a passage behind?In this boundless chaos, one had never seen or sensed it before. Perhaps it was just like the river of time. If one had not reached that stage, one would not be able to see or sense it.However, if you were strong enough, you would be able to sense it.The long river of time was forged by Time and Stars. In reality, Time and Stars were not strong, so long Zhan could sense it. However ... It was obvious that if the passageway in this chaos was the way of space, it must have been left behind by the master of Tian Fang.Who could see it?Who could discover it? In any case, Li Hao had never noticed it.At this moment, he thought of something.The blood Emperor had once said that in the past, there were some dark passages near neo martial that concealed it, making it unknown to others. It was only when neo martial became a tier 7 great world that it emerged from chaos.Neo martial was considered a world that was sealed.Who sealed it?Zhan Tiandi?Why did he seal it?Don't you want to be found?As soon as neo martial appeared, human King didn't do much at first and had been in seclusion. Later, neo martial and red Moon had a conflict. Was it an accident or an ordinary conflict?The passageway ...There was actually a passage in the chaos, a space transmission passage ... Did that mean that the master of Tian Fang could actually return?Then why not return?Tianfang world would always be recovering. If he could really return, wouldn't it be easy for the master of tianfang?Wasn't resuscitation easy?What were they waiting for?Countless questions arose in his heart. Also, did he have to completely merge with the chaos before he could see the passage?Why couldn't the Queen see it?He had never heard her mention it before. Was it because she was too weak to see it? or was it because he had merged with time and was a little special that he could see this scene? That passageway was boundless!It was also like a long river, crossing the primal Chaos, penetrating the lightning territory, and heading straight to the West ... It was as if it connected the East and West.The moment he merged with the chaos great Dao, Li Hao seemed to have become a part of the chaos.In that instant, he even saw a gaze.It was to see, not to sense.His gaze was like a wolf's eye in the dark night, emitting light from the endless darkness. Li Hao was shocked and in disbelief!Someone could really see through the chaos!No... No matter how strong a person was, he couldn't see that far. That meant ... Dao!Yes, it was Dao.These people's DAOs had fused with the entire primordial chaos ... No, fusing with the Dao of primordial chaos should be his current state. These people's DAOs seemed to be ... Independent of the primordial chaos.However, it also filled the entire chaos.They weren't in the chaos, but they were everywhere. Therefore, they could sense what was going on in the chaos at any time. They could see everything. Perhaps, they had to pay a price.However, this proved that chaos had always been under their watch.Where were these people?What was he doing?Was the master of Tian Fang a good person or a bad person?Or rather, why did those grade-9 experts who had disappeared in the past disappear? why?Could the chaos not tolerate them anymore?Too many questions emerged in Li Hao's mind. At this moment, he even saw the West, the extremely far west ... Vaguely, some light flickered, as if he had returned to the past.He had returned to the time when he was weak. He could see the strength of the cultivators in the distance like he could see energy.A long time ago, Li Hao had been able to see it.That was the sword eye that came with his bloodline!Later, when Li Hao became stronger, he actually understood what kind of ability the eyes had. The reason he could see the illusionary Dao Meridian at that time was probably because the sword venerable had a great relationship with the universe of the great path.Therefore, Li Hao could see the energy condensed by the Dao Meridian.It was impossible to see the strength of a Martial Master back then.This was because martial masters did not cultivate the Dao Meridian, while superhumans did. Therefore, it was not that martial masters had reserved their power, but that they had different systems. At that time, Li Hao had used this ability to avoid many crises.This time, he seemed to have seen such a scene again.Now, he was very powerful, so were his enemies and the other cultivators ...As a result, the sword eye was actually useless. It could be used to look at the weak, but did the weak even need to be looked at?With a single sense, he knew everything.As for powerhouses, Li Hao didn't sense them when they were hidden last time, so he naturally couldn't see them. But now, he seemed to be able to see them again.Why so?The Dao of chaos! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He somewhat understood now.For example, the sword eye was a system with the Dao Meridian. The essence of the sword eye was the Dao of the sword Saint and the key to the great path universe. Therefore, he could see the Dao Meridian.

Chapter 3463 A Different Perspective (2)
Now that he had merged into the chaos ... He could see some great DAOs or even Dao domains. This meant that ... The chaos great Dao might be where the source of the myriad DAOs was?Was it like this?In other words, the chaos great Dao was actually similar to the Dao origin of the great Dao universe!The chaos great Dao was the time stars of the Silvermoon universe, the desire planet of the Crimson Moon universe, and the core Dao origin of the great Dao universes of other great worlds ...Therefore, almost all the cultivators in the primordial chaos were cultivating!Even if he hadn't fused with it, he was still cultivating the Dao of chaos!Before the fusion, Li Hao had never expected such a result.The Queen ... Was really useless.He didn't sense anything.Other than knowing that he could absorb endless chaos energy, the Queen's integration with the chaos great Dao did not give Li Hao any special insights. Today, he had only gained so much by integrating with it.As expected, it was better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books.Only by putting it into practice could one find the truth.At this moment, Li Hao had a deeper idea. Since he had merged with the chaos great Dao and could sense the existence of other people's Dao, this meant that ... Whether it was the great Dao universe or the chaos beasts, they were actually the same system of the chaos great Dao.It seemed like nonsense.Born from chaos, how could it not be a system of chaos?However ... According to what he had seen so far, perhaps level nine would break away from this system!It was still different.All chaos beasts, all itinerant cultivators, great Dao universes, and worlds were actually of the same system as the chaos great Dao. However, a level nine had broken away from this system ... What did this mean?He did not know.Yes, at this moment, Li Hao didn't know what it meant.Did it mean that only by breaking away from this system could one become a level nine?Or could it be that after becoming a Grade 9, he might no longer be on the same side as the chaos great Dao?Or could it be that rank nines were completely independent of the chaos? or perhaps ... The chaos did not tolerate them, so rank nines could not return?However, since he could not tolerate it, the group of tier 9 experts were all in the primordial chaos back then. This was where the contradiction lay.And ...At this moment, he once again looked to the West. It was very far, so far away that it seemed endless. There, he could vaguely see some light. This meant that the light must be shockingly bright!Was this ... Huntian Supreme Emperor?This meant that huntian Supreme Emperor had not left the system of the chaos great Dao and was still in this system. Was he really a rank nine Supreme Emperor? He shifted his gaze.He looked towards the Dragon Lord.Li Hao was slightly stunned. The Dragon Lord was very close to him, so he could see more clearly. At this moment, the Dragon Lord was a huge ball of light in Li Hao's eyes, just like how he had looked at the supers in the past.It was very eye-catching!A huge ball of light transformed into a giant dragon, protecting the Dragon Master. It was formed by the fusion of countless great Dao laws. Li Hao did a simple count ... It was close to 7000!It seemed to be stronger than before?He couldn't see it before and could only make a simple judgment, but he saw it today!Li Hao looked in the direction of the Dragon Lord ...At this moment, the Dragon Lord seemed to have noticed something. He turned his head instantly, his eyes cold and sharp as he shouted in a low voice,""Silver Moon King, you're absorbing the primal Chaos energy here. This King doesn't want to argue with you, but are you spying on me?" He was shocked in his heart. How could this guy spy on me?Li Hao was only at the seventh step!Li Hao, on the other hand, was slightly moved. He saw ... He saw that apart from the Dragon Lord, there were several other level 8 DAOs. Level 8 and Level 7 DAOs were different in his eyes at this moment.Regardless of whether a Dao domain had been formed, it was different.The black Tiger's Dao was very simple and not as complicated as thousands of them. There was only one Dao, but it was like a fierce tiger, carrying endless killing intent. It was not as complicated as the Dragon Lord's Dao, but simple and direct, but extremely rough!Nearby, there were a few people with similar Dao laws.One of them was red Moon Lord ... She was stronger than Black Tiger, but not just one. Like Dragon Lord, there were many of them. This meant that Red Moon was not walking on a simple path of desire, but a combination of them. Desire was not a great path, and Li Hao knew this long ago.At this moment, it was only clearer.The second one was actually Feng Yan!Feng Yan had reached level 8. Li Hao didn't know this before, but now he did. More importantly, there seemed to be something else on Feng Yan's path. It was like a line that was connected to him!Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. This was ... An Alliance of the great Dao.That's right. He had signed an agreement with Feng Yan, so it was actually a kind of Dao that was constructed by the great Dao Alliance and connected him and Feng Yan together. In the past, Li Hao had signed an agreement with Feng Yan that if he attacked Feng Yan, he would encounter a lightning tribulation of the seventh rank when he was still at the sixth rank.Furthermore, if he reached Level Seven, he would have to face level eight lightning tribulation! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  And now, he was at the seventh step.In other words, this agreement had always been there. If he attacked Feng Yan, he would attract an eighth-grade lightning tribulation ... When Feng Yan saw him just now, he didn't react at all. He didn't act like he was the enemy who killed his mother. This fire Phoenix Princess, who was still considered innocent before, seemed to have matured a lot.He had even deliberately hidden his strength.But at this moment, Li Hao saw that the line was still there!Li Hao's consciousness gradually returned. The river surged wildly and a large amount of chaotic force poured into it. Many of the newly-established realms in the Qianjie were absorbing chaotic force at a crazy rate.

Chapter 3464 A Different Perspective (3)
A group of venerable sovereigns were helping Li Hao sort things out.Li Hao thought that the Dragon Lord might make a move at this moment, so he kept his eyes on that side.In the end ... He didn 't.He didn't even try to stop her.The Dragon Lord seemed to have resigned himself to his fate, or perhaps he didn't want any accidents to happen, and he didn't want to fight with Li Hao's group.Li Hao looked again ...Just as he was about to take a closer look, the invisible giant dragon on the Dragon Lord's body, the Dragon of Dao, suddenly roared like thunder. No one else sensed it, but Li Hao was greatly shocked!BOOM!It was like a spiritual attack, like a god!It was said that the gods of the chaos race were very weak. Therefore, it was best to use gods against the chaos race. However, at this moment, the power of the great Dao on the Dragon Lord's body was like an aura God, taking on a corporeal form!BOOM!Even the three rank eights didn't sense the invisible explosion. Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to have suffered a heavy blow in an instant. The entire River of Dao suddenly fluctuated violently, almost out of control. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In the distance.The Dragon Lord suddenly turned around!Golden light flickered in his eyes. He didn't see it wrong, he didn't sense it wrong. Li Hao was indeed spying on him.He was very bold!At this moment, Li Hao's original body suddenly opened his eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood into the chaos. It was not blood, but ... God!Force of influence!The force of Shi continued to shatter and disperse. Li Hao's face was pale as if he had been seriously injured. He looked into the distance and saw the Golden Dragon's Eye in the distance. Li Hao grunted and looked in that direction. Then, he looked at the people around him. They were all extremely nervous, but they didn't seem to sense anything."Long Zhan ..."Li Hao coughed. This time, he seemed to have been hurt by the Golden Dragon. He panted and suppressed the fluctuations of the river of Dao. Then, he looked in the direction of the Dragon Master, his mind full of thoughts.The Dragon Lord's God was actually so powerful!In other words, the more Dao laws one had, the more powerful one would be.7,000 great Dao!It was indeed unbelievable for a Chaos Beast to form a Dao domain and comprehend 7000 nomological laws. The Pengcheng and Kunpeng that he had encountered previously seemed to only have a strong physical body and fast speed. There was nothing special about them in other aspects.​ As for the Dragon Lord, the most impressive thing about him was his powerful fists.But today, Li Hao had a new discovery and understanding. If he used ordinary methods to deal with the Dragon Lord, he might be killed by the Dragon Lord instead.Li Hao's God was actually very powerful.His spirit was formed by fusing with force. Every Dao was a kind of force. The force fused with the divine text, and the divine text was also the manifestation of the spirit. However, even with so much power of the great Dao, he was still injured by the other party's attack.Li Hao frowned.A Dragon, a Dragon in the chaos, how could it cultivate so many DAOs?There were still some differences between beasts of primordial chaos and humans.He was born in the chaos. To be honest, to be able to sort out the chaotic Dao, it was not just one or two, but seven thousand. This long Zhan must have some special inheritance.At this moment, Li Hao was a little curious about long Zhan and his background.Was this guy really a beast of primordial chaos born and raised in the tianfang region?I don't really believe it!Tianfang world was only so big, and the biggest opportunity in the entire four-side domain was in tianfang world. However, tianfang world had always been in destruction. How could this person have cultivated so many Dao techniques?And far away, long Zhan looked over from a distance.His eyes were cold. He looked at the turbulent chaos and frowned. Is Li Hao peeking at me because of the chaos great Dao?He ... What did he see?As for Li Hao, he didn't look over there anymore. If he really angered long Zhan and attacked now, although he wasn't afraid, both sides would suffer losses. It wasn't worth it. The human King was probably not his match now ... Alright, it was 100% not.The mortal king only had around 5000 Dao marks while the other party had 7000 Dao marks. His physical body was stronger than the mortal King's and his spirit was also stronger. He had almost no shortcomings.Under such circumstances, even if human Kings and Supreme martial artists joined forces, they might not be able to defeat him.In the last battle, long Zhan had forced Samsara back and killed a rank eight under his nose.Li Hao stopped looking.Instead, it suppressed the river and absorbed the power of great DAOs. Chaotic force kept pouring in. Li Hao and the others sorted it out and filled some small worlds. At this moment, the spatial tunnel before them also disappeared.It was as if it had never existed.Li Hao came to a realization. Perhaps he had to fuse with chaos to see it. He did not usually fuse with the chaos great Dao, so he could not see it now.Tian Fang's master had left behind a passageway ... In that case, the people of Tian Fang might have returned through this passageway?Or what?He had many thoughts in his mind as his body continued to absorb Primal Chaos energy to suppress it.The surging chaotic force began to calm down. Much of the chaotic force in the surroundings had been extracted. At this moment, the chaotic force absorbed by Li Hao's River of great Dao gradually calmed down.Realm domain, new realm domain. In just a short while, nearly a hundred of them had been filled.Although it was still a little messy, it could be transformed into a new realm after some sorting. This was faster than devouring some worlds. In just a short while, it was equivalent to devouring a rank seven or eight great world.Of course, this was the first time he had fused with it. The chaotic force nearby was dense, and it would probably slow down in the future. However, this speed was still shocking.According to Li Hao's judgment, as long as he continued to cultivate in a place rich in chaotic force, he might be able to fill a small World in a Day. A thousand worlds would be filled in three years.

Chapter 3465 A Different Perspective (3)
It didn't sound too fast ... But what if he advanced to the eighth step?Moreover, the Queen was also providing him with more.In other words, Li Hao had to make great progress in two or three years. Otherwise ... He would be stuffed to death.Who could guarantee that at the seventh or eighth level, there would be a leap every two or three years?Li Hao stopped thinking about it and began to suppress the power of the great DAOs.……This time, it lasted for a few days.No one came to interfere.Long Zhan seemed to have ignored him directly. Even the cultivators of the chaos race did not come over to take a look. Perhaps they did not dare to, or perhaps long Zhan had restrained them. He allowed Li Hao to draw away a large amount of chaotic energy from this place.……Three days later.Li Hao's River of Dao no longer surged with chaotic force. Instead, it calmed down.Everyone was relieved.These days, everyone had been very nervous, ready to fight at any time, worried that they would be attacked. In the end, they didn 't.At this moment, the Thunder monarch was a little surprised and unhappy. He muttered,""Long Zhan is also a master who bullies the weak and fears the strong!"Back then, he was extremely ruthless to our Thunder World.It had been sealed for hundreds of thousands of years!But now, Li Hao came to your territory and directly absorbed a large amount of chaotic force, and you didn't even let out a fart.Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned slightly and glanced at the distant tianfang world. His expression changed. After a long time, he said,""Let's go. If there's nothing else, don't come to the square region!"He said.Everyone was stunned. Why?Long Zhan was clearly a little lacking in confidence this time.If new martial and silver Moon joined forces, there was nothing to be afraid of.Li Hao didn't say much. He just looked into the distance. The tianfang boundary was surrounded by giant Dragons!The Dao Law Dragon!Long Zhan this fellow actually did not look wild. But in reality, he was wild in the dark. What did he want to do?Devouring Tian Fang?Or ... Did he have other ideas?This guy must have made some arrangements for Tian Fang, and it might involve level nine. Li Hao frowned slightly. I hope it won't involve me, although I don't think it's likely.It was because of him that he owed Tian Fang a favor."Tian Fang's return ... Might need me to pay for it!Li Hao frowned.That's right. At this moment, he knew that he might have to face something. Tian Fang's return might not have any trouble at first ... Li Hao had thought that it would be smooth, but now it seemed that it would be troublesome.The trouble was long Zhan! Back then, when he had wandered over, Daoist Coiling Dragon and Daoist Firesmoke had both said that he would have to pay a heavy price in the future.Wasn't it still okay?Li Hao thought to himself.If he didn't return it, there would be a knot in his heart, which was the so-called demon of the Dao heart.He sighed in his heart."On the day Tian Fang returns, perhaps I will have some conflicts with long Zhan. Even at this moment, both sides are avoiding each other because it has not touched upon our fundamental interests yet.But ... Long Zhan was clearly having ideas about Tian Fang.However, he had to save Huo Yan, Coiling Dragon, and the water Daoist. He had to resurrect them, and that would definitely affect long Zhan's interests.At this point, Li Hao understood how troublesome it had been for him to make use of the other party's strength.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The strongest was only at the pseudo-seventh rank. The price he had to pay now might be to fight long Zhan, who was at the peak of the eighth rank ...Li Hao didn't regret it. He had indeed been of great help back then.It could only be said that ... The price-performance ratio was slightly worse.After borrowing the strength of Grade 6 and Grade 7 a few times, in the end, it might cost the lives of grade 8 people, so it wasn't really worth it.Shaking his head, Li Hao turned around and left.At that moment, he looked at the surrounding realms. A large number of major worlds had gathered there. Almost all the human major worlds in the square domain had been transported here.At this moment, Li Hao slightly frowned.In these great worlds ... There seemed to be a special power. His eyes moved slightly and he looked into the distance. He looked at long Zhan again. He could not see that special fluctuation very clearly at this moment. Perhaps he had to merge it with the chaos great Dao to see it clearly.Previously, long Zhan deliberately shattered my spying. Was it not only because I spied on him, but also ... To stop me from looking at other realms?What was this guy planning again?……He passed through the lightning territory once again.The human King and the others were outside and they quickly rushed over.The human King was also somewhat puzzled, long Zhan this fellow can really endure! If it were me, I would've done it regardless of the losses. But in the end, we slapped his face like this, and he could still endure it!"It was not ordinary!Li Hao nodded. Frowning, he looked behind him and said softly,""Yes, he can. I suspect ... He's plotting against tianfang.""That's for sure!"The human King was speechless. Wasn't this nonsense?"Not tianfang universe ... I mean ... The master of tianfang!" Li Hao explained.The human King was stunned for a moment before he said,""It can't be, right? Tian Fang's master is at least a top-tier level 9 existence, while he's a level 8. I admit that he's slightly stronger than me, but there's a limit to his strength ..."He's so bold?Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"the master of Tian Fang and his group are probably still alive, but they definitely won't return so easily ... Tian Fang still has a large amount of energy, but we can't find it now. Tian Fang might have a second-level Dao universe or even a world. Long Zhan might have some judgment. I even suspect ..."Li Hao paused for a moment before continuing."I suspect that the day Tian Fang returns, the will of the master of Tian Fang will return. How about ... Borrowing the power of the will of heaven or the power of a Dao master in another universe to condense a body with level nine power or close to level nine power and return?"

Chapter 3466 A Different Perspective (3)_5
Zhi Zun's heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly looked at Li Hao and said in a low voice,""Why do you make such a judgment?"Li Hao explained,"in the past, apart from the master of Tian Fang, it was said that the strongest in Tian Fang were the light and dark side's rank eight venerable sovereigns. With the current situation, the return of a rank eight venerable sovereign is indeed not weak. However ... What can a mere rank eight change?" What was the point? Tian Fang's master has always been spying on us ... Since he knows, even if there are more level 8s in Tian Fang, is it useful if they don't have the strength of a tyrant?""Therefore, I feel that if they return, there will definitely be Overlord-level powers appearing. At the very least, there will be 7000 or more type 8!""If it's not one of the other level 8 martial artists, then it must be a clone, a Dao body, or a will of the master of Tian Fang ... In short, it's in another universe. It's a pity that I haven't found it. Of course, if I do find it ... If I dare to move, I might be struck by a Thunderbolt!" Long Zhan might have seen through something too. He's planning this!"At this moment, Li Hao made his judgment.The Supreme-being's eyes flickered. He had some understanding of Tian Fang, but not as much as Li Hao, because Li Hao had clearly seen and calculated that at least 100 billion great Dao crystals had disappeared when Tian Fang had been destroyed!It was just enough for many experts to recover.However, where were the Dao crystals?The top expert in the Dao of space, Tian Fang, had not left anything related to space, except for the Dao chess.However, Dao chess was only a weapon, a weapon of enlightenment.Could it be that there was nothing left except for the Dao chess?One man is short.Zhi Zun was a calculative person. At this moment, Li Hao informed Zhi Zun, who was deep in thought. At this moment, Li Hao sent him another message."Oh, right. The square domain ... Or rather, the entire primordial chaos. There's a passageway that might be a spatial teleportation passageway!"The expression in the Grandmaster's eyes changed slightly!In his eyes, countless thoughts and thoughts seemed to appear.The passageway!Teleportation!The master of Tian Fang!At this moment, he was frowning. What were these Grade 9 experts doing?The master of Tian Fang had deliberately emptied Tian Fang, but left behind a hidden passage and a hidden universe, waiting to return. He couldn't understand what the other party was thinking.He knew that the other party was still alive. This was inevitable. Then, as if he had thought of something, he said to Li Hao,""Don't mention it to anyone else for the time being. It should be well hidden and no one has discovered it. I'll investigate first. Of course, I might not be able to find anything. If I find anything, I'll inform you!"After saying that, he transmitted his voice again,"don't tell Fang ping either. This guy is too curious. If he knows, he might go and investigate. Once he does ... It'll be really troublesome.""Master of Tian Fang ... We don't know much about this top tier level nine, but I do know one thing. In the past, Zhan Tiandi might have traveled to Tian Fang! "He must have traveled around Tian Fang through past means ... He must have had contact with the master of Tian Fang. However, he sealed my neo martial until I entered Level Seven. Only then could I appear in the chaos. It has been a million years since Tian Fang disappeared!""So ... Who is Zhan Tiandi guarding against? There are countless worlds in the square region, and neo martial artists aren't weak. In that case, who are they guarding against?"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "Crimson Moon? Could it be that Zhan Tiandi has traveled to the future and knows that the red moon will target my neo martial arts?""Also, in the past, there was a dark barrier outside our neo martial. The passage led directly to the outer region and could even cross the Thunder region ... It seems ... That they hoped that we could leave directly from neo martial and not stay in Tian Fang.""This passage left together with the Silver Moon ... It disappeared!"The Supreme martial artist had said a lot at this moment. He then said to Li Hao,"Where do you think the dark passage is? Why did it disappear? Or ... It's directly connected to the space Channel, which is the one you saw. Zhan Tiandi borrowed the chicken to lay the egg and conveniently connected neo martial to that channel ..."This way, he could borrow someone else's path.As for Zhan Tiandi himself, it seemed that his main body had never left neo martial. Naturally, he did not have the ability to build such a passage that ran through the Thunder territory. He was only a sixth rank venerable sovereign.Li Hao's heart moved!It was really possible. The passage that appeared in the outer area of neo martial, could it be the one he had just discovered?That ... Must have something to do with the time star.Perhaps ... The time and space Stars could connect to this hidden passage.Later, as the time star left neo martial, the area around neo martial lost that passage.At this moment, Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He suddenly sent a voice transmission,""If I remember correctly, in the past, there was actually a world near neo martial. When senior human King took care of Celestial Emperor, the human King's sister, including venerable the sword, had gone to another world! Logically speaking, this world is near neo martial and even within the range of the passage ... Right?""That's right!"The Grandmaster laughed and transmitted a message.Li Hao frowned.That's not right!Since neo martial was sealed off, why were there still worlds near neo martial?"Is there anything special about this world? I've heard from senior Zhang an that it's actually just a small world, close to a medium-sized world. It's not that great ... Because it was worried about the invasion of the human King, it left on its own after sending off venerable sword and the others ..."

Chapter 3467 A Different Perspective (1)_6
The human King seemed to have been there personally once!However, he ran away on his own.After that, there seemed to be no more news about this world.Li Hao hadn't paid much attention to it, because it was said to be very weak.If it disappeared, then it disappeared.But now that he thought about it, it was not right. Since it was sealed, where did this world come from?Also, without the existence of chaos beasts, how did the other party escape with the world?"Also, it is said that before the Silver Moon was born, the other party had already run away. However, after the Silver Moon was born, the dark passage completely disappeared. Before that, it didn't completely disappear. Once you enter the chaos, you will be lost in the blink of an eye!Today, when Li Hao thought of this, he was actually a little dazed.Could it be that there was a problem in this world?Obviously, Zhi Zun had been thinking about this for a long time. After all, he was one of the leaders of new martial arts, so he was naturally more concerned about this than Li Hao. At this moment, he sent a voice transmission,""Before we walked out of the chaos, we didn't really understand. After we walked out, we realized that ... It's not simple! That world disappeared. We tried to find it, but we couldn't find anything. "The Supreme martial artist revealed some more information."This world didn't bring any trouble to neo martial. Instead, it saved li Changsheng and the others at a critical moment. In other words, we, neo martial, owe it to them." It had been circling around neo martial at an extremely close distance! Or even ... Monitor or protect neo martial? I've been looking for it, but I've lost all leads ...""In addition, the great Dao of this world was a bit special. According to what we call it, it was the Dao of magic! All sorts of magic, all sorts of techniques, the Grand Dao can summon you and summon you at will ... You can easily control the Grand Dao. "Li Hao was stunned.Easy?The DAOs of chaos were not easy, as they were all complicated and mixed.To control it easily ... Unless ... It was a Dao with rules, an orderly Dao.He was stunned!In the past, he wouldn't have understood the Dao of order, but now, he did. His expression changed slightly."Supreme martial artist, do you think that such a world ... Actually doesn't exist in the present world?""What?""I mean, is it possible that this world ... In fact, it's similar to a fragment of space that existed in the past. It was affected by some time stars, which led to the disorder of time and space, so it appeared near neo martial!""You couldn't find this world later on, not because it went into hiding, but ... It really disappeared and returned to the space it was originally in!"The Supreme martial artist's expression changed slightly. He looked at Li Hao for a long time before he sent a message."How is this possible ... The illusionary space that Zhan Tiandi created back then only had a few lives, but that was a real world. Unless ... Someone controls time, the future time? Under the intertwining of time ... You still share the same origin as the current time and Stars. Could it be ... You?"He looked at Li Hao with a dazed expression. Could it be Silver Moon?That's not right!If it was Silver Moon, I would definitely be able to recognize him.Li Hao shook his head. It wasn't him. It definitely wasn 'T. He had a guess ... Could it be ... Related to the person he had seen in the river?The stars of time are with me right now, but I've been thinking about giving up since earlier. I may not be in control for long!That person said that he had unified the chaos!In that case, could he have mastered the time and star that he had left behind, and thus embarked on the Dao of battle? not only did he battle the heaven sovereign, but he had even combined some special Dao, and then ... He thought of it, and then connected it to the neo martial arts?If time and space were to be in a state of disorder, would such a situation occur if that person were to reverse time?If that was the case, things would be interesting.Li Hao had a headache.What was even more interesting was that the Silver Moon had been separated when the human King had been in seclusion. The core of the Silver Moon was the time star. Would the time star run away by itself? Or could it be related to that world because that person knew that time and star would not remain in neo martial in the end because ... He had seen him?The more he thought about it, the more incredulous he felt.Was that even possible?The separation of the Silver Moon led to the disappearance of the dark tunnel and the world on that side ... Could there be some connection between all these?This time, Li Hao didn't go into detail.This was just his own guess!If that was the case, it was very likely that when they were walking the river of the future, he had told the sleeping person that he was outside and thus affected him?Was it the other party who influenced him, or was it the other party who influenced him, or was it something else ...The more he thought about it, the more he exploded!Magic? The so-called magic, was it not the path of laws? it was displayed in Holy prose and released in an instant. There was a clear distinction. Fire was fire, water was water, and it was not mixed with other paths. This was the path of magic in the eyes of the Autarchs, right?However, at that time, be it Supreme martial artists or human Kings, they didn't have much knowledge. Even if they saw it, they might not be able to distinguish it.As for sword venerable, he was not even a venerable sovereign at that time, so it was even more difficult to distinguish him."What are you guys mumbling about?"At this moment, the human King was unhappy."You two have been transmitting your voices for a long time. Do you think I'm deaf? Are you done? why didn't you bring me along? what do you mean?"“……”Li Hao was embarrassed, but the Supreme martial artist was all smiles. As if he didn't care, he said with a smile,""We're saying that you're actually afraid of long Zhan. Otherwise, you would've long gone in to find trouble. Now, you're actually not cursing anymore ..."The human King's expression turned ugly.Besides, that's definitely not what you two are talking about. Do you think I'm an idiot?He glanced at old Zhang, then at Li Hao, and reminded him,""Don't get too close to old Zhang. He's not a good person. If you're fooled by him, don't blame me for not warning you!"Li Hao laughed dryly."Thank you for your reminder, human King. I know!"The Grandmaster was speechless.F * ck, who's family?We are!This fellow, you're helping an outsider!Laughter was laughter, but since nothing had happened this time, it was also less trouble for them. Both parties did not say anything more and left quickly.After they left, in the four direction region, long Zhan turned his head back to take a look, his eyes somewhat dark.Li Hao ... Might interfere with her.This guy had some ties with Tian Fang. He had to be careful about this. This guy was a shit stirrer. Together with that Street bumpkin Fang ping, they could easily ruin his plans.At this moment, he could only come up with a perfect plan to avoid any accidents.Li Hao, I hope you won't seek your own death!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The Dragon Master didn't think about it anymore. He closed his eyes and the giant Dragons continued to wrap around the entire sky without anyone seeing.

Chapter 3468 The Heavenly Daoist Sect (1)
The Dao fusion chaos was a source of energy that was endless. This process was not too dangerous. The real danger was the future.For Li Hao, the future was still far away.At this moment, he was thinking of many things.This time, he had seen and thought of too many things. In addition, the words of the Supreme martial artist, as well as some of his own discoveries ... Made Li Hao feel even more strongly that some things in the current chaos might not be as simple as they seemed.Tian Fang!He turned his head to look at the four-sided domain. Tianfang had a big secret.The biggest secret was the master of Tian Fang.Why did he leave?He had gathered many grade-9 cultivators. Where did they go?Why didn't he return?What was the relationship between Zhan Tiandi and the master of Tian Fang?Zhan Tiandi had sealed the new martial. Who was he guarding against?Li Hao kept these doubts in his mind and stopped thinking about them. The most important thing now was to fill up the small realm and open up a new one!It filled the little world and now had Dao fusion chaos.And to open up a new realm, he still needed to create an illusory realm of ten thousand DAOs.Time waits for no one!After leaving the chaos and the four-sided domain, the situation had become more complicated. Everyone was plotting something. As for himself, he had prepared too little. With Tian Fang's return, it might be another fierce battle ... He had to take advantage of the rare gap to prepare everything.He wasn't a human King. Although it wasn't bad to be decisive in battle, it was easy for problems to arise that he might not be able to solve quickly.……After saying goodbye to new martial, Li Hao and his team returned to Alliance City No. 9.It had been more than ten days since the battle with the reincarnation Emperor.The chaos knew no time.For many people, ten days was like a snap of a finger.Li Hao had spent three years in the chaos, but he didn't feel much. Three years were actually very short. Three years in the Silver Moon might have felt long, but three years in the chaos was nothing more than an instant.In this place, age had been forgotten.In fact, it had been almost six years since Li Hao became a martial artist at Silver Moon.However, a mere six years was nothing more than a nap for many people. Yet, the chaos had already changed drastically!When Li Hao's group returned ...Venerable Emperor Wanqiu appeared in an instant. Her aura had changed as well. Li Hao had asked for a seventh-level venerable Emperor's corpse from the neo martial arts world, and she had obviously devoured it.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At this time, he was in a transformation period.Logically speaking, this was the time to cultivate in seclusion instead of going out. However, when she sensed Li Hao's aura, she did not dare to continue cultivating. She hurriedly walked out of her Dao universe.At this moment, there was an old man beside him.He had the air of an immortal ... His white hair fluttered in the wind.Seeing such a person, Li Hao's first thought was not that he was highly respected, but that ... He was a sinister old man.He had traveled to new martial arts and various places. Often, this kind of person who looked like a celestial was actually not a good person.Was this the myriad transformations Emperor?He was a ruthless man who had opened his Dao domain by himself. Yes, to Li Hao, anyone who could reach Level Seven without relying on the Dao universe was a ruthless man.One had to open their own Dao domain!When he looked over, a divine light flickered in his eyes. At this moment, what entered his eyes was something that others could not see.Dao domain!It was like a big bowl that covered the old man. Dao laws appeared in front of Li Hao's eyes. Li Hao took a rough look, and this time, he could make a clear judgment.It was close to 2000 Dao laws!According to Li Hao's judgment, a seventh-level venerable sovereign with 1000 Dao laws was seventh-level, and 2000 Dao laws was the peak of seventh-level venerable sovereigns, or even close to eighth-level.When a Sword Saint opened up a Dao domain, there were about 3000 Dao laws. However, it did not mean that the Dao laws of a Sword Saint had reached the required level. It could only be counted as half. A Sword Saint still needed some time to settle down.That invincible stage six expert would need some time to strengthen his Dao law if he wanted to be comparable to a stage eight.However, the person in front of him only had 2000 Dao laws, but his Dao laws were thick. Clearly, he was not a newly-advanced level Seven but an experienced Level Seven. Strictly speaking, his strength should be slightly stronger than Wu Shan and the Thunder Emperor back then, but he was slightly weaker than the two who had just entered level eight.A seventh level peak venerable sovereign!Li Hao's heart moved.On the other hand, the old man's eyes flickered slightly. He did not sense anything. His spirit was not as strong as long Zhan 's, but at this moment, he also sensed that the other party ... Seemed to be observing him.He didn't mind and smiled.""Myriad incarnations greets the seniors."There was no age in cultivation, only strength.The strong were respected!Although he was old, and Li Hao and the others were still young, the strong were the truth. Even an old man like him still called them seniors.Li Hao smiled."I'm flattered. Daoist myriad incarnations, you're too polite!""Congratulations, senior Hao Yue, for your great progress ..." Thearch Wanqiu said hurriedly,"seniors, why don't we have a cup of tea in my house and discuss the Dao after we sit down?""Then I'll have to trouble Daoist Wanqiu.""It's what I should do!""Yes," replied Thearch Wanqiu hurriedly as she led the way."There are still a few elders in our Alliance who will come, but ... It's a long way and may take a little time. Senior myriad transformations is powerful, so he came first. However, the elders have also sent a message. As long as senior myriad transformations has no objections, our world Alliance will abide by the agreement."

Chapter 3469 The Heavenly Daoist Sect (2)
At the side, myriad transformations Emperor did not say anything.Would the Chinese world Alliance dare to disagree?He didn't dare.Therefore, the so-called "let me make the decision" was actually just a perfunctory remark. In fact, he hoped that he could fight for more benefits and not fully contribute to this group of people.After Samsara was defeated, the extreme Ice realm had gathered together. Now, the middle world Alliance was also very nervous.They were afraid that another war would break out and sweep across the East, making it inevitable for their worlds.……The group of people soon arrived at the mansion in the center of the deserted island.This was not the world of Supreme Emperor Wanqiu and she did not dare to invite these experts to her world. This was where she usually rested and was also the core of the entire deserted island.However, the chaos was in turmoil now, and there were fewer venerable sovereigns on the deserted island for trade.Li Hao didn't ask the others to follow him. He told them to find a place to rest first before he entered the mansion.No one else entered the room. Although venerable Emperor Wanqiu was already half a step into Level Seven, she still acted as a servant. She arranged for the two of them to sit and quickly served them tea.Li Hao wasn't overly polite.On the other side, myriad transformations Emperor had also been secretly observing Li Hao.Li Hao, the Silver Moon King, was a cultivator from a subsidiary world of the new martial. He was very young, and the Silver Moon King had only appeared in the chaos a few years ago. From just becoming a venerable sovereign, to the current seventh rank ...Seventh rank, that was unbelievable.This was the first reason. Second, Li Hao had, in a short period of time, gathered the Son of Light, Kong Ji, the second-in-command of the cloud world, Wu Shan, the Thunder Emperor of the Thunder World, and the sovereign weapons and chess pieces left behind by the master of Tian Fang.This was the terrifying part.Li Hao was a cultivator from a subsidiary world. In terms of fame, he wasn't as famous as the neo martial human King. In the chaos, he was still a newcomer, and so was the neo martial human King. However, his power was at level eight of the human King realm, and everyone knew how powerful he was.Although the middle world Alliance had collected a lot of information about Li Hao's battle achievements, they knew that he had killed a group of chaos beasts, all of which were Level Seven Supreme emperors. Even the famous Fire Phoenix and other chaos Supreme emperors had died at his hands.Furthermore, this person had previously assisted the new martial arts world in breaking through the Crimson Moon world.After that, he entered the outer region and killed Supreme Emperor di yang. A few days ago, he killed the sun and moon monarchs, Supreme Emperor lie tu, and Supreme Emperor Fu Sheng ...This was Li Hao's achievement these days.There weren't many of them, but upon closer inspection, the strength of these people was simply shocking. They were all seventh or eighth level venerable sovereigns. They weren't famous, but they were extremely ruthless.Venerable sovereign myriad transformations was rather afraid of this young man.But ... He was also filled with anticipation.Yes, anticipation.Ten thousand illusions!The myriad Dao Pavilion! This was something he had always wanted to do, but he could not do it. In the chaos, he had built so many myriad Dao pavilions. Was it just to meet the needs of everyone?Naturally, it was not.In the chaos, there was no such thing as good or bad people. Everyone had their own interests.Clearly, the myriad Dao Pavilion was a pursuit of Dao for the myriad transformations Emperor.At this moment, seeing that Li Hao didn't take the initiative to speak, he didn't stand on ceremony and directly said,""I heard that senior Hao Yue ...""Fellow Daoist myriad incarnations, you can just call me fellow Daoist."When an old man of unknown age addressed you as senior, there wasn't much sense of accomplishment, only disharmony.Li Hao interrupted him.Myriad transformations Emperor did not stand on ceremony. Li Hao was at the seventh-rank, so was he. However, Li Hao had a few eighth-rank subordinates, so he naturally had to give him face.At this moment, he stopped being polite and went straight to the point.""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, it's said that you can connect all the illusionary realms of ten thousand DAOs together. If I may ask ... Is it through the great Dao universe?"He looked at Li Hao in confusion.The chaos was too big!Even if it was only the Eastern Region, which had countless worlds, a major world could only spread to a certain distance. It could not spread infinitely.How many great worlds would it take to cover the East?A hundred?Or more?This was a terrifying range.He had to ask clearly in advance."Not a Dao universe, but a Dao domain!" Li Hao smiled."Dao domain?"How was that possible?Myriad transformations Emperor frowned. Are you trying to fool me?Li Hao continued."It's a dispersed Dao domain. The construction of a Dao domain is called the bed law. In my Dao domain, it's called the bed law.
