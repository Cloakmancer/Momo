"There are a total of 9999 squares, corresponding to 9999 great DAOs. According to the senior daoqi, passing 1000 squares means that you have the Enlightenment of a first level venerable sovereign, not strength. Here, strength is not important, but the Enlightenment of the great DAOs. Maybe you are a third level venerable sovereign, but your enlightenment may not be at the third level ... However, you have the Enlightenment of a third level venerable sovereign, so you will definitely reach the third level. It will happen sooner or later. This is the place for the Dao discussion!"The venerable sovereign, who had arrived earlier, didn't care about the people around him. Seeing that many people were looking at him, he said excitedly,""Therefore, Dao chess is a way to sort out one's own great Dao and also an opportunity to gain enlightenment! "The first time is free, but if you want to leave the second time, you have to pay a price, including your own comprehension of the great Dao and a part of the great Dao crystal ... Of course, if you walk through 1000 squares, you can get a free chance to walk again. In other words, if you walk through 3000 squares, you can walk three more times for free ..."At this moment, many newcomers were shocked.A ninth-grade Emperor weapon!The master of Tian Fang! Level eight Dao chess!He had probably never been so shocked in his entire life.The newcomer was also a little excited and nervous.""All the newcomers can leave?""Of course ... The first time will be free. Of course, you'll have to leave a spiritual imprint on the Dao chess ... It's alright. Don't be afraid of exposing your identity. Dao master Hao Yue once said that although others don't know our identities, there are two people who must know. One is him, and the other is myriad transformations Emperor. So ... Don't expect to completely hide your identity. Of course, Dao master Hao Yue won't care about it."As he was speaking, the chess pieces suddenly fluctuated. At this moment, the illusionary figure of the chess pieces appeared and the sound was like a great Bell,""More than 10000 venerable sovereigns have entered the heavenly Daoist sect! "From today onwards, the great Dao roll will be open! If there were more than a thousand people who walked The Path of Go, they would be ranked! The more you go, the higher your ranking will be. The top 100 can play the Dao chess for free and comprehend the truth of the great Dao!""The top ten will continue for one month. They can appoint a rank seven venerable sovereign to exchange DAOs for one day!""The top three can discuss the Dao with me, Wu Shan, the lightning Emperor, and myriad transformations, a few rank eight venerable sovereigns, for a day!""The first place will be stable for a month. You can have a Dao discussion with Supreme Emperor Hao Yue for three days!"As soon as he said that, the world shook!The entire heavenly Daoist sect was in a frenzy.This ...  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The Dao roll!The release of the great Dao ranking drove the venerable sovereigns crazy. In other words, as long as they could rank high and go far enough, they could not only discuss the Dao with a seventh-rank venerable sovereign, but even an eighth-rank one, and even ... The legendary bright moon Dao master, who could control time!The other party had once killed the number one powerhouse of the East, Samsara.This time, the entire secret realm was shaken. Some venerable sovereigns no longer cared about their status and shouted,""Senior daoqi, is the ranking of the great DAOs based on how far one can go?"Dao Qi's voice was loud and clear,"not bad!" The further you go, the deeper your understanding of the great Dao and the more great Dao you master. Reaching the 7000th square even means that if the opportunity arises, you can definitely become a rank seven venerable sovereign!""Supreme Emperor Hao Yue has a message for me ... He wants everyone to comprehend the thousands of great DAOs. He will also comprehend your DAOs when you merge your DAOs into the dojo. It's a win-win situation. If you're worried that the great DAOs will be leaked, you can not go to Dao chess ... Otherwise, if you enter Dao chess and comprehend the great DAOs, your own great DAOs will definitely be leaked. It will be known by me and Supreme Emperor Hao Yue!" Everyone was shocked.They were at a loss, but in the next moment, many people suddenly came to a realization. Some low-level venerable sovereigns were even more indifferent."Dao master Hao Yue, do you still think my Dao is worthy of your attention? It's my honor to be able to catch my eye!"This time, many people instantly came to a realization.That's true!What are we?They were just a group of middle and low level venerable sovereigns.The other party spoke bluntly,"how much you gain from the chess game, the Dao you comprehend will also spread out, and be known by Haoyue and the chess game ... Only the strong will prevent the weak from prying, and the weak will not worry about the strong prying."All of a sudden, the cultivators who were a little nervous before instantly sobered up.That's right, what are we afraid of?Those who are barefoot are not afraid of wearing shoes!It's true that venerable Emperor Hao Yue created a heavenly Daoist field and even started a war with the Samsara monarchs. If he didn't take any benefits, wouldn't he be a Saint?"It's not a problem that venerable Emperor Hao Yue thinks highly of us. Senior Dao Qi, it's just that ... We're weak. Even if the ranking is out, it'll be difficult for us ... To enter the ranking, right?"Some people were conflicted.Although it was fine if he didn't enter the rankings, there were benefits to entering.Envy!Dao Qi laughed."Cultivation doesn't necessarily depend on strength. Here, it depends on one's Dao heart and one's comprehension of the great Dao ... Of course, the strong have their own advantages, but the weak also have their own advantages. That is to improve faster. Dao chess itself is a weapon for comprehending the Dao! To the weak, they have a better chance ... Of course, they can't be too engrossed in it. To master 10000 DAOs, one has to be a peerless mighty figure. However, it's still possible to broaden one's horizons!""Senior daoqi, will the leaderboard ... Be made public?""Yes ... But you can leave your name at will. You don't have to worry about finding the wrong person and leaving your name ... We are spiritually connected. If you don't want to discuss the Dao with us, you can give up the opportunity."As soon as he finished speaking, the chess pieces trembled, and a stone tablet fell from the sky."The Grand Dao ranking!"At this moment, balls of light flickered on the great Dao roll, and the voice of Dao chess sounded again,""Only a thousand people will be recorded on the list. Everyone who is on the list will be connected to each other spiritually. They can leave their names. The details will not be displayed, but their whereabouts will be revealed!"

Chapter 3541 All Rivers Run Into The Sea!
As soon as he finished speaking, many names suddenly flashed on the stone tablet.At this moment, there were more than 10000 venerable sovereigns.A portion of them were deep in thought, some voices ringing in their ears, they could hide their names or not.Everyone looked at the stone tablet."Xuan Tian, 6200 squares!"Everyone was stunned. The person in first place actually revealed a name. Furthermore, there was a number of moves. This was nothing.The key was ...Many people knew this person!"Celestial Thearch Xuan Tian is here?" someone asked in surprise. Senior ..."This ... Was a seventh level venerable sovereign!That's right, how could the black heavenly Emperor, a seventh-rank world Lord, only walk 6200 squares?More importantly, the other party had revealed his real name.Someone could not help but shout,"if we leave behind the names of the others ... Wouldn't it bring some trouble? venerable sovereign Xuan Tian is a seventh level venerable sovereign. He shouldn't be here. Who would be so bold to impersonate ...""It's a secret!" Dao Qi's voice rang out again."Some experts and high-level venerable sovereigns have some taboos in the chaosverse. We'll try our best to avoid them, too, unless ... The other party is our true self!"At this moment, a venerable sovereign revealed his true appearance in the crowd and sighed.""I'm Xuan Tian...I don't need to pretend to be anyone. "After he finished speaking, he looked up at the sky and the stone tablet and sighed.""I ... I only walked 6200 steps ... I thought I could walk more than 7000 steps, maybe even 8900 ..."He laughed bitterly and helplessly.It turns out that I've overestimated myself.In that case, I haven't even reached the standard of the seventh step?This ... Was too embarrassing.He was not a venerable sovereign of an eighth-rank great world, but a true seventh-rank Dao master!Dao master had walked over 6000 squares here. Although he was currently ranked first, it was ... Quite embarrassing.Perhaps, he was the only tier 7 here.In the next moment, the second name flickered. Someone said with a bitter smile,""Daoist Xuan Tian, why must you introduce yourself? We were so embarrassed that we didn't even dare to show our faces. Fortunately, fellow Daoist introduced yourself, and when I saw you, I shamelessly ... Revealed my true name!""Yu Xiao, 6000 units!"When this name appeared, it caused many people to exclaim in surprise. This was also a rank seven venerable sovereign and a Dao master from the Eastern Region. Two rank seven Dao Masters had actually come!The key was that they only reached the 6000th square.When venerable sovereign Xuan Tian saw this, he looked at one person. That person also gradually revealed his true appearance. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry."Daoist Xuan Tian's enlightenment of the great Dao is deeper than mine. Fortunately, you're here ... I don't feel too embarrassed.""I ... I thought ..." Venerable Emperor Xuan Tian laughed.I thought there wasn't a seventh rank. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 So there was still more!Yu Xiao master was a rather famous rank seven Dao master. The two worlds weren't too far apart. He had done this today out of curiosity and the intention to cozy up to someone powerful. After all, he lived in the East.He didn't dare to look for new martial arts and didn't have any connections, so he came here.However, because he was interested in chess and curious, he played 6200 squares. Now, he found out that 7000 squares were the standard for seventh-level cultivators to comprehend the great Dao ... He instantly felt ashamed.He showed his face because he wanted to tell Li Hao that he had come with no intention of hiding his identity and that he wasn't an enemy.I'm not even afraid of letting everyone know about the embarrassing things.In the end, there was someone who was in the same line of work, and it was even more embarrassing.It was actually 200 slots less than his own.At this moment, someone's voice drifted from the crowd,""The two of you have at least made it to the 6000th square. If you don't make it to the 6000th square ... Then you won't be revealing your real names. That's ... Really embarrassing!"The two exposed venerable sovereigns looked at the crowd and saw a group of light balls. The one who had spoken didn't reveal his face. At this moment, he was really ashamed.I'm also a Daoist master!Yes, a rank seven Dao master. It was already embarrassing enough that they had walked 5999 steps, so they didn't dare to make a sound. However, when they saw that the two of them had walked more than 6000 steps, they were too embarrassed to make a sound, even though they were both Dao Masters.Of course, the reason why he said that was because he wanted to see if there were any other more embarrassing tier 7 beings nearby.With the performance of this group of seventh level venerable sovereigns, gradually, many names appeared on the light ball. Some were real, some were fake, but in any case, everyone had done it together!'It seems like only two rank seven Dao Masters have reached 6000 or higher. What ... Are we afraid of?'The names of the top ten also gradually appeared, but they were all fake. The names of the third to eighth place were all 5999. When this situation appeared, many people instantly realized that they might all be ... At Level Seven!Of course, there was a possibility that this was not the case. It was normal for a Grade 6 to reach this stage.However, only two rank seven path Masters had made it to the 6000th square. Many people were confused, and even venerable sovereign blackheaven was puzzled."Senior daoqi, is there such a huge difference between discussing the Dao and strength? Although Yu Xiao and I aren't true seventh rank Supreme sovereigns, we aren't weak even if we boast shamelessly. Why ... Did Yu Xiao and I only reach six thousand?"Dao Qi's voice resounded."This is a judgment made based on tianfang, Haoyue, the new martial human King ... Many experts. Supreme Emperor Haoyue's meaning is that the seventh rank, the true seventh rank, must condense the Dao domain!" Only when you have comprehended around 7000 Dao laws ... It doesn't mean that you have to condense so many great Dao laws, but you have to have comprehension. At this level, you have a chance to reach more than 7000 Dao laws. This is what they call a true Level Seven!"

“……”So, we're all pseudo-seventh rank?"Dao domain ... A Dao domain can be formed with 1000 Dao laws, right?" Thearch blackheaven said."Yes,"Dao chess replied,"they can be condensed. Comprehension is comprehension, and condensation is condensation. Take Supreme Emperor Hao Yue for example. He has comprehended countless DAOs. Previously, he played 8000 squares, but it doesn't mean that he can condense 8000 Dao laws. It can only be said that there is hope in the future ... At this moment, he is still condensing his 3000 Dao laws!"“……”Is it appropriate for you to reveal your strength as the Silver Moon King?Of course, no one would believe him.Go to hell!3,000 Dao laws, you killed Samsara?No one knew how powerful Samsara was, but they knew that even an ordinary rank-8 had at least 2000 to 3000 Dao laws. Strictly speaking, the weakest rank-8 and those who had just advanced had at least 2000 Dao laws. This was a standard.If he did not reach this stage, he would not be considered a level eight venerable sovereign.If venerable Emperor Hao Yue only had 3000 Dao laws, and he was still in the present ... Then was reincarnation killed by a dog before?However, the meaning was clear.Only by forming a Dao domain would one be qualified to be considered a true grade 7.They ... Were all considered pseudo-seventh rank?He was speechless!"Then, in the current chaos, aren't there ... Very few who can reach seven thousand?" Thearch blackheaven asked."Probably.""In fact, it also depends on the strength," the chess piece replied again."If you go to the eighth step, even if you don't have enough comprehension, you can still force your way into the 7000th square ... Therefore, the chess piece is the combination of strength and comprehension!"Xuan Tian understood.At this moment, he had also revealed his face and did not say anything. However, he had revealed his identity. If all the venerable sovereigns present were not stupid, they would understand what he meant.In other words, the mysterious heavenly world has acknowledged the Silver Moon King as the Overlord of the East!As for the danger?There was nothing more to say. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Now that chaos was in turmoil, how could it not be dangerous?At this moment, Dao Qi didn't say anything more, leaving one last sentence,""The heavenly Daoist temple welcomes all fellow Daoists to discuss the Dao. You can discuss the Dao on your own, enter the Dao chess board, or occupy the list. The evaluation is held once a month. For the venerable sovereign, it won't be too long. We'll all take the time to come and discuss the Dao ...""Regardless of North, South, East, or West, even if the three overlords are willing to come, they will open the door of convenience and welcome you! There's no need to worry about what we'll do to you if your identity is exposed. As long as you don't destroy the Dao Plaza, this place ... Is the Holy Land of the great Dao!"Regardless of North, South, East, or West!Anyone who wanted to come could come.Those who wanted to discuss the Dao were free to do so. As soon as he said that, all the venerable sovereigns present were moved. He was all-inclusive, all-inclusive, all-inclusive, all-inclusive, and all-chaotic monarchs could come at will. Even the seventh rank venerable sovereigns were shocked by this.This venerable Emperor Hao Yue ... Was really arrogant!Of course, it could also be said that he was very bold. Dao chess was the one who controlled the Dao of space. This ... He dared to open it up so casually. It was too incredible.Seeing that the chess piece was about to leave, Xuan Tian finally gritted his teeth and said,""Senior ... Please wait a moment. I have something else I would like to ... Consult you on?""Speak," he said."It's said that ... It's said that Dao master Hao Yue has mastered the Dao of time. Do we ... Have the chance to ... Observe time?"Dao Qi seemed to be pondering and consulting. After a while, under the expectant eyes of countless venerable sovereigns, he said,""But! Supreme Emperor Hao Yue, there's news that there are more than 8000 players who can find him to discuss the Dao of time at any time!"Eight thousand!As soon as he said that, many people were speechless. Forget it, it has nothing to do with us.Dao Qi continued,"I'm not rejecting you. It's just that if you don't reach the 8000th step, you won't have the ability of an eighth-grade magician. Even if you can comprehend time, it's no different from the space contained in Dao chess!" It's completely meaningless ... Only when I reach rank 8 and comprehend time, I might be able to gain something. There are some ... Laws involved!"The rules?Some venerable sovereigns in the crowd trembled when they heard the word!The rules?Seventh-rank venerable sovereigns had some understanding of the great Dao. At this moment, the middle and low-rank venerable sovereigns might not understand, but they more or less understood."The rules?""Right!""Eight thousand ..." Venerable Emperor Xuan Tian suddenly became absent-minded and muttered to himself,""In that case, it's only after reaching the eighth rank that one can comprehend laws. So time ... Involves laws! I've heard a senior mention it before. It's said that the current overlords of the three forces may have mastered some laws, including the level 9s from a million years ago ... In that case, we ... We may ... Have a chance to master some laws?"Hope!At least, he saw a little hope.He couldn't believe it. Had the Silver Moon King gone crazy? he dared to ... Talk about the rules?This was the sign of an Overlord!Also, did that mean that the Silver Moon King had also ... Reached that stage?At this moment, in the crowd, not only him, but also some venerable sovereigns disappeared instantly. They were teleported out of the passage and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Dao Qi saw this but did not say anything.Once the news spread, perhaps ... The entire chaos would be shaken once again.The rules!Li Hao was willing to exchange the rules, but the prerequisite was that a top expert had to come and walk through the 8000 Dao laws. There were not many existences at this level in the entire chaos.The reincarnation of a living person was fine.Even Extreme Ice might be slightly inferior.In other words, there were only a few people in the current chaos who could reach this stage. At most, ten of them were Overlord-level existences.

If these people were willing to come and share their DAOs ... It would be a great success for Li Hao.It was also a key to perfecting his own Dao!Although there were many venerable sovereigns now, they were too weak. They had comprehension of all kinds of DAOs, but it was not deep enough. Only by attracting the top existences could they complete their own Dao path faster!Even if he couldn't directly reach the ninth-rank, he had to at least smooth out the path to the ninth-rank.……Eastern Region.The venerable sovereigns left the secret realm one after another and started to spread the news.……In the South.Spring Autumn Palace.It was said that the spring and autumn came, and no one knew the time.However, at this moment, there was only a little girl in the spring Autumn Palace. At this moment, her ears quivered as if she had received some news. She muttered,"" 8000 Dao laws, sharing time, exploring the rules together?"Suddenly, a smile appeared on her small face."The rules ..."At this level, they all understood that order was the key to entering the ninth rank.However, in this chaos, how many people understood the rules?Obviously, this news wasn't directed at the weak. It was directed at the overlords. Are you willing to share it?There was no need for a true body!At this level, it wasn't too difficult to create a clone. It wasn't for fighting, but to share some of his great Dao experiences.Are you willing to come?Come, I'm also willing to share my time with you!Was that even possible?Time was the strongest Dao."Li Hao!"At this moment, the seemingly harmless little girl smiled sweetly. Li Hao, a time cultivator, had actually spoken to the chaos Overlords in public.Do you all want to know the secrets of time?Come to me, we'll discuss the Dao!Share your DAOs, I will also share mine.At this moment, the Overlord of spring and autumn couldn't hold it in any longer. Time ... Everyone thought that the Dao of spring and autumn was the Dao of time, but only spring and autumn knew that he was wrong.That was not flowing time!One year, one glory.Who said that the traceless spring and autumn was time?There were some similarities, but there were also great differences. At this moment, a little girl of the same size walked out of the little girl's body. She seemed to be real, crossing the universe with each step. Li Hao, since you've invited me, I'll go and take a look!……In the West.Huntian Supreme Emperor was also stunned. Time, laws, Dao discussion!"The heavenly Daoist Rite ... Sharing time. Li Hao, what a great move!"At this moment, he suddenly felt that he might have underestimated Li Hao. The rule of sharing!He looked at the black figure beside him."Since Li Hao invited me, I also want to go and take a look. I'll send a clone or two to the East. It's also a good time ... To take a look!""The decision is yours, master." p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Huntian nodded and said no more. A shadow appeared on his body and he headed east.……At this moment, the entire place was shaking.Even in the square region, long Zhan also frowned slightly. Looking at the tianfang world in front of him, he suddenly felt a little emotional and sighed,""Li Hao, you're really bold and crazy ... This move might ... Attract some incredible beings!""Fine ... I'm also very curious about his Dao. I'll go there too!"Beside him, the grade 8 experts were a little confused. After long Zhan finished, Red Moon sovereign gritted his teeth,""Dragon Master ... I ...""Fellow Daoist ... You also want to go?"Red Moon Thearch nodded expectantly. He ... Wanted to take a look. Of course, he would not go in person. It was too dangerous. Li Hao would kill him.However, he wanted to see, see, and listen ... Even if he might not have the chance.8,000 Doug!​ Although he had never played chess before, he knew that he probably did not have the ability to do so. It was difficult.However, it wasn't a bad idea to experience the Dao of chess and the Dao of Tian Fang.The Dragon Lord nodded,"anyone who wants to go can go!" "It's not just you and me. Everyone else ... Including the primal Chaos race, can go. Find an entrance to the secret realm, control it, and enter! Daoqi ... Tianfang's Dao is very helpful for us to understand the tianfang universe. For Li Hao to make daoqi public at a time like this, he's a ruthless man ..."At this time, Tian Fang might return!At this moment, he was opening up the Dao chess game. Whether it was to attract people or for other reasons, at this stage, it was actually disadvantageous for Tian Fang to reveal the master of Tian Fang's Dao chess game.Although the master of tianfang had also opened up the path of chess, it was only relatively open. Previously, it had been very troublesome to enter the path of chess. He had to break through some of the barriers in the dark Demon Ridge.This put an end to the thoughts of countless venerable sovereigns.Only the true top venerable sovereigns had a chance of entering. Tian Fang wanted to communicate with these people, not all the venerable sovereigns in the chaos.At this time, Feng Yan's face was also solemn.""Father ... This ... Rule ... What are these?"When long Zhan heard that, he thought for a moment before saying, you don't understand, but you still need to go and figure it out! The current chaos was actually disorderly. Of course, it was also relatively orderly, but there was no absolute order! "Cultivators, cultivators, at our level, if we want to go further, we must clearly understand the difference between order and disorder. And the Dao of order, perhaps ... Is what Li Hao called the rules!""This is actually a necessary step on the path to grade-9!"Long Zhan explained for a while."Ordinary people don't understand. But reaching tier 7, they can more or less understand it a little. But my chaos race is even harder to understand because of our natural chaos!"

He sighed."It's hard to understand what rules are. So ... Even if you reach level eight, you won't understand."He felt a little regretful."However, I also recovered instantly. This is also the reason why I want to change my fate. We, the chaos race, are the natives and children of the chaos. Why ... Do I have to do this?"Why was he so biased towards the human race?​ Is it because we, the primal Chaos race, have never produced a tier 9?Then I shall be the pioneer of the chaos race!If we can sort it out, the Dao of the chaos race will allow us cultivators to understand what laws are!"Even though most of the seventh rank venerable sovereigns in the chaos and the human race's venerable sovereigns don't understand, they can more or less understand what I'm talking about. However, the eighth rank venerable sovereigns on my side don't understand either.……As Li Hao's side stirred again, the experts in the entire chaos were tempted.He didn't need his true body to go.At this level, who didn't have the ability to create a clone?They could find the entrance to the secret realm, hide their identities, or enter directly. Even if they lost their avatars, it would not matter. However ... Everyone was really curious.Some of the experts from the other three forces even felt that ... Perhaps they should open an entrance to a secret realm in their own territory.He was originally very repulsed by it!But at this moment, they were all looking forward to it.Chess, time, space, the great Dao roll ...To the entire chaos, all of this was no different from a bomb that would wake up all the top existences.The primordial chaos was far too quiet, far too boring, far too dry. The only thing that existed was battle, devouring, and fighting for supremacy ...In the vast chaos, even a tier 9 would find it difficult to change the current situation.However, with the establishment of the dojo and the emergence of time, the world's heroes were invited. All of a sudden, the chaos became lively again. The East, which had just been quiet, became lively again.……"This is really ..."At this moment, in new martial arts, Zhi Zun also complained.This young man really knew how to toss and turn!Previously, he had sympathized with him and felt that he was very lonely. But now, damn it, neo martial arts had not yet cleared the trouble in the East, and this kid was going to share time and space again!Space-time was the most top-notch great Dao in the entire chaos. It was ranked first and second ..."What you're doing now, if a large number of level 8s come, or even if an Overlord comes personally, wouldn't that ... Be giving us trouble?As for the human King, he chuckled and was somewhat excited.""Fun, interesting! It was lively! Old Zhang, why don't you and I change our names and go in to have some fun? The heavenly Daoist Rite ... The world's heroes discussed the Dao! They all say that I'm not good at the great Dao and only good at attacking. I really want to show them that only people like us are qualified to walk 8000 Doug bars ..."Beside him, the light Thearch was also moved.Of course, he also had some thoughts."My son is still there. It's very close, but I don't have time to visit him. I heard that my son also got a share of the loot this time ... Does this kid have any hope of entering level eight?"If there was ... That would be terrible! Moreover, he was also very interested in these great DAOs. No expert would not be interested in them.Even a person like the human King liked to join in the fun, let alone others.The heavenly Daoist sect!Li Hao!Who would've thought that Li Hao would really soar after leaving the square domain?At this moment, not only them, but the seventh rank venerable sovereigns and those below were also tempted. "It's good to go and take a look. We also want to play Dao chess and see if our comprehension of the great Dao is profound or shallow! It's said that 90% of the rank-7 can't even make it to the 7000th step ...""It's more than that! Some of them didn't even reach six thousand!""This thing is interesting. It doesn't look at strength, but Dao ..."The human King chuckled,"this thing is just for reference. In a real fight, one's cultivation level doesn't matter! Of course, it's not bad either. For a theoretical person like Li Hao, it's an intuitive theoretical performance. The strength of one's comprehension of Dao can be seen at a glance, but one's true strength can only be revealed through a fight!"He added,"Li Hao is a man of theory and practice. He's not a pure theoretical person. Don't be fooled by him. He's devoted to the Enlightenment of the great Dao. Even if you've comprehended 9000 Dao laws and are only at stage three, you'll still be easily killed by a stage four!"He then added,"Zhan Tiandi, for example, had at least 9000 comprehensions back then. However, he was only at the sixth rank. He might be able to deal with the seventh rank, but he would definitely be defeated by the eighth rank!" Everyone, do you understand?"At this moment, there was less teasing and more solemness.Li Hao's heavenly Daoist Rite was a good place, but if one only cared about these things, they would only become a theoretical person. However, in the chaos, practice was sometimes more important than theory.Of course, both were indispensable. Without the promotion of people like Li Hao, the theory of great DAOs could not be completely spread, and the development of chaos was greatly limited.However, this goal was too far away.The human King didn't like to think about things that were too long-term, which was not in line with his character."I understand, don't worry!"Everyone responded one after another, and the human King soon laughed again. He said with a mischievous smile,""Of course, theory is also necessary. If you don't have any theory at all and just know how to do it, it won't do! For example, iron head needs to be supplemented with some theoretical knowledge ..."Everyone was speechless!Here it comes again.The human King teased, then quickly looked at Zhi Zun."Then, old Zhang, you should think about how to completely bring the East under your command ... Let's find a secret realm and move back to neo martial. It's right at the door of our house, and we can enter as we please ... Well, aren't celestial pole and King Huai over there? Those two snitches run so fast ... Get them to bring one back for me. I'll take it as my money for supporting them all these years!"“……”In the crowd, Emperor Xi was speechless. Why are you scolding my son?Alright, you can scold me all you want, it has nothing to do with me!The Grandmaster smiled, but didn't refuse, because ... He was also a little curious.Did Li Hao's comprehension of Dao improve again?This guy was improving really quickly.The second Battle?As he thought about it, he looked at the human King. He was actually curious ... How far could this kid go?It's been many years since I've gone to ask him about his enlightenment in the cultivation of the great Dao.

Chapter 3545 Fighting For The First Place!
As soon as the words of the rules were spoken, experts from all directions moved.The entrance to the secret realm had become a hot cake. Every day, it was filled with people.The great path ranking instantly became the widely acknowledged great path ranking in the eyes of countless cultivators. It was a fair and honest ranking. You could walk as many blocks as you wanted. There was no danger, and you could comprehend the great path. There was no need to fight ... It only depended on your comprehension of the Dao.This did not represent combat power, but in fact, it did.Those with weak combat strength would not be able to go far.In all directions, the eastern cultivators surged forward. They did not have the sorrow and helplessness of the countless powerhouses who had fallen before. Instead, their blood was boiling, and they could not wait to enter the heavenly Daoist temple, discuss the Dao, and become famous!Fame might not be a bad thing.With fame, there would be resources, great Dao, and many, many things.Countless people entered the heavenly Daoist sect with dreams.In this place, some people became ordinary people, while others soared to the sky!The Dao roll was also constantly changing.Previously, the Xuan Tian Supreme Emperor and the seventh rank Supreme Emperor had taken first place after 6200 squares. Now, a large number of seventh rank and even some eighth rank Supreme emperors had concealed their names and entered the heavenly Daoist sect to play chess.7,000 cells were no longer a natural chasm.However, there was still no one in the 8000 squares, which made countless cultivators feel helpless. There were even tier 8 powerhouses whose real names had appeared on the great Dao rankings. The other party was only ranked at the back, having walked more than 7000 squares.This was still a rather top-notch level eight!One could imagine that the people in front of him might be some top-tier rank-8s who did not want to be named, but no one had made it to the 8000th square.8,000 slots had become the threshold for many rank-8s, and even for everyone.It seemed that cultivators of the present day who had reached the eighth step still could not reach this stage.……The heavenly Daoist sect.At this moment, this place had become the most lively place in the entire chaos. A large number of venerable sovereigns had gathered here. They didn't know each other's identities, so they didn't have any scruples.Some people even started a business here and set up a stall, but no one cared or drove them away.As long as you dared to trade offline, Li Hao wouldn't care.There were also people here who specialized in playing chess. There were also people here who participated in all kinds of small group Dao discussion meetings. If one didn't have some real ability, they really didn't dare to go!In the center of the secret realm, under the chess pieces, there was a public Daoist Hall.He could publicly preach here.In the past few days, only one rank seven had gone up to discuss the Dao. As a result, during the discussion, his Dao heart was almost broken, and the great Dao was belittled. Although he had overcome the difficulties in the end and even gained some enlightenment, this also caused those who were not determined or absolutely confident to not dare to rashly go up to the great Daoist field to discuss the Dao.Now, these cultivators were like teenagers who were addicted to games.They had almost nothing to do on normal days. Some of them had been idle for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, but they did not dare to run around because the chaos was too dangerous. The heavenly Daoist Rite established by Li Hao had almost become the permanent residence of these people.This gave Li Hao a headache.There were too many people!His original plan was to keep a thousand people in the secret realm at all times. However, a large number of venerable sovereigns ... Were not leaving! Yes, they were here, and they were not leaving.In Li Hao's eyes, time was valuable, but not to venerable sovereigns. Since they were here and this place was so interesting, how could it be called a Dao discussion if they didn't stay for a few years? How big was the chaos?It was too big!Even in the East, there were more than ten thousand venerable sovereigns. No one knew how many venerable sovereigns there were, maybe tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands ...Not only the East, but the other three forces had also sent venerable sovereigns.As a result, there were more than 10000 venerable sovereigns in the core of the mystery Land!It was unimaginable!If so many venerable sovereigns appeared at the same time and joined forces, even a level eight venerable sovereign would be crushed into dust.Many ants could bite an elephant to death. One or two hundred low-rank venerable sovereigns, even those at the eighth rank, were not afraid.He could kill even more.However, when the numbers increased to thousands, then tens of thousands ... Even a Paragon Emperor would feel their scalps go numb.……On this day.One of the thousands of passageways outside the secret realm trembled.……Below the secret realm.Li Hao was still filling up the small realms. Now, the 2000 small realms were almost completely filled up, and the energy obtained by the Samsara realm was almost exhausted.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly opened his eyes.The secret realm appeared in his eyes. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  As he passed by the venerable sovereigns, a man appeared in his eyes. He had just walked out of the space tunnel.Li Hao looked carefully, and his eyes flickered.Was this ... The Overlord of some place?He wasn't too familiar with the overlords, but when this person entered, the river of time felt like it was overloaded. If it wasn't just a clone, but a spiritual body, it might have directly caused the river to collapse.This person was very, very strong!At this moment, Li Hao's eyes glowed even brighter as the great Dao merged with the chaos.He suddenly looked at that person!He had seen through the illusion!……In the secret realm.The man who had just walked out of the passage suddenly looked down, and his eyes flickered. Very quickly, he smiled and the corner of his mouth moved slightly. "You're a guest. Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, although this is your territory, isn't it inappropriate for you to invade someone's privacy?"……At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered.The moment he fused with the chaos, he saw boundless darkness that seemed to cover everything. At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat enlightened and surprised, but he still quickly sent a voice transmission."I didn't expect it to be huntian Supreme Emperor from afar, sorry for the delay!"

Chapter 3546 Fighting For The First Place!
Huntian!It was definitely him.Li Hao didn't expect that, as the strongest expert in the chaos, he would actually come.It was unbelievable!Fortunately, it wasn't his main body.Otherwise, Li Hao would have to escape.Yes, it was too dangerous.This kind of person, regardless of whether he was a real tier 9 or not, was definitely far superior to an ordinary tier 8!He was too difficult to deal with."I heard that fellow Daoist is willing to discuss the Dao of time with cultivators with more than 8000 slots. I'm also interested. Fellow Daoist ... You won't chase me away, right?""How could I!"Although Li Hao was apprehensive, he still said calmly,""Those who come are guests. Just as senior said, my Dao field is open to the public. Moreover ... There's an order to the Dao. Senior is a rank 9, so you're giving me face by coming here to discuss Dao. How would you dare to drive me away ...""You do your thing!"At this moment, the Daoist also smiled.""I'll take a look first and familiarize myself with it. After I finish the game, I'll be able to make it to the eight thousand squares, and then we can chat. Otherwise ... Fellow Daoist Haoyue, you'll be underestimating me, thinking that I'm here to take advantage of you. "Li Hao didn't say much. He just smiled and said,""Then please do as you please, senior!"He didn't think there was anything wrong with it.As an Overlord and the strongest expert in the chaos, the other party naturally had his own tolerance. He could not have gotten to where he was today purely by brute force.Since the other party wanted to follow the rules, it was best.This way, he could also observe a thing or two.……At this moment, the secret realm shook again.Huntian Daoist didn't reveal his true appearance either. However, he still turned around to take a look. The others might not have sensed it, but he did. At that moment, a short figure appeared.Huntian Daoist saw through the cover."What?"He was a little surprised, but not really surprised. It seemed normal for her to come.The little girl, who had just walked out of the passage, turned her head and saw through the Daoist not far away. She saw through his cover and revealed a sweet smile.""Huntian, long time no see!"He clearly looked very young, but his tone was extremely mature, with a hint of playfulness.Huntian had actually come!Interesting! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  But today, as if they had agreed on it, the secret realm trembled again when the two of them were facing each other. In their eyes, they seemed to see a giant dragon roaring. The next moment, an extremely strong figure appeared.It was extremely tall!That person appeared with a cold glint in his eyes. He looked around, and when he saw the little girl and the middle-aged Daoist, his eyes flickered. He nodded slightly but didn't say anything.Long Zhan!Huntian Daoist looked at him as well. The spring Autumn Emperor also looked at long Zhan. This was the chaos race that rose from the four regions and the Overlord of the Dragon race. Although he did not reveal his true strength, no one looked down on him.He had easily defeated Samsara and killed a rank eight venerable sovereign in front of Samsara ... This was true strength!New martial and silver Moon dominated the East, but they didn't go to the four-sided zone. They were driven out of the four-sided zone. This was strength.In the past, they had actually met before. At this stage, they were not as young as Li Hao. They were all familiar with each other. Although they might not be very familiar with each other, they all knew each other.The moment long Zhan arrived, there were still quite a number of people following behind, arriving one after another.They didn't see anything.Powerhouses had a connection between powerhouses.Long Zhan didn't want to care and looked at the chess pieces in the sky. He knew about the chess pieces, but he had never been there before.At this moment, he was a little curious.At this moment, an extremely overbearing aura suddenly surged over. This time, it even attracted the attention of the others in the mystic realm, and they all looked over!Shadows appeared one after another, not one or two, but many.It was as if the master of a great Dao had brought all the venerable sovereigns of the realm here for a walk.That person appeared, incomparably overbearing!At this moment, there were even some people who were a little suspicious. To be so flamboyant in the heavenly mystery realm, they couldn't help but think of one person.The human King!Of course ... It was hard to say if he was. But to be so ostentatious and domineering upon entering, he was obviously not a human King or an ordinary cultivator.……At this moment, Li Hao shook his head in the secret realm.So many people had come!Have these people made an appointment?It was fine if he didn't come, but when he did, he came together.Was it telepathy or what?The human King was the closest and the last to arrive. Did he sense something, so ... He deliberately came last?Oh right, didn't anyone from the five elements side come?Li Hao was a little confused.Did they not make it, or were they unwilling to come, or was it something else ...He had some doubts in his heart, but he didn't care.At this moment, someone beside him also sensed something. Myriad transformations, who had just come out of seclusion, was sweating profusely. He looked at Li Hao nervously and said,""Daoist master ... It seems ... Not too good!" He was in control of the myriad Dao illusionary realm and could sense some things.He had lost contact with a few Mystic realm entrances!Li Hao nodded."I know. A few peak experts have come ...""Huntian, Chunqiu, renwang, and long Zhan are all here."Ten-thousand transformations 'expression changed instantly!These people are here?This ... Was too terrifying.Even though these people had been rank eight before, in his eyes, they were all top figures, especially overlords like huntian Chunqiu. They were existences that he could not come into contact with, but rather, looked up to.He had already reached level eight, but ... These people were still existences that he could not reach."This ...""It's fine. They're just avatars ... Oh, the human King isn 't."

Chapter 3547 Fighting For The First Place!
Li Hao smiled."The spiritual body of the clone isn't too strong, but it still has a great Dao Comprehension. Even if the clone comes in person, it'll only have the power of an Ordinary Level eight at most. Don't worry!"Myriad transformations suppressed the throbbing in his heart. At this moment, he said with some hesitation,""They're here ... For the rules that Dao master mentioned?""Yes."Myriad transformations was secretly shocked. Was it really necessary?All of a sudden.How terrifying!At this moment, Li Hao did not say anything but continued to open small realms. Now, countless venerable sovereigns were playing Dao chess, and the Enlightenment of the great Dao in Dao chess would be transmitted to Li Hao. Recently, Li Hao's enlightenment of the great Dao had deepened a lot.The realms were opened up one by one, but they were just empty realms.It was just that it had not been filled with energy.He was establishing his 3000th world. Only after establishing his 3000th world did Li Hao truly possess the strength to rival a top-tier level eight. 3000 worlds were at least comparable to 5000 great DAOs, right?Only then could one be considered to have a foothold in the chaos.They might be a bit worse than Samsara, but they were only second to this group of people.Li Hao continued to create his own little realm, not caring about it.……In the secret realm.At this moment, the human King had indeed arrived. Furthermore, he did not hide anything. He could sense some top-tier existences, but it did not matter!So what?The human King had always been flamboyant!It had always been like this.At this moment, he laughed out loud in an extremely arrogant manner. His arrogance depended on who he was facing. If his original body had arrived today, he would have kept a low profile. But it wasn't his original body, so what was there to be afraid of?If your main body comes, I'll run!"The first place on the board only has 7400 squares. Which piece of trash walked this?"“……”There was a commotion in the crowd. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  F * ck, this man must be the human King!Other than him, no one else dared to say this. Of course, even if someone dared, they would not say it.This guy was really unscrupulous.He was too Savage!Behind him, Zhi Zun and the others kept a distance from him. This person ... Had an extra mouth. In the past, he was not so overbearing. Later on, no one restrained him and he became the boss of a new martial arts group. He was really unscrupulous! The human King looked at Dao Qi and chuckled,""Today, this Prince will also play a course of chess and will not hide my name ..."As he said this, he thought of something and added,""However, it's too boring to go alone. I like excitement. Friends, do you want to go with me?"If one person left, he had to be the first to leave. If there were fewer people, it would be too embarrassing.If the big talk was released, it would not end well!The first one was usually something only the villains would do. The protagonist was usually the one holding the fort. When the human King thought of this, he felt that it was better to pull a few people together. He would make arrangements after seeing each other's situation.I'm good at breaking through during a battle!At most, he could just rely on his own strength!They were just avatars, and he was the original spiritual body. If he were to fight them head-on, he would still have some confidence and be able to walk a little more. However, there was not much meaning in improving his Dao. Unless someone else had walked more than him, he would not be bothered to do so.However, he could not lose face!At this moment, no one paid any attention to him.As for the human King, he chuckled as he looked at the few figures in the crowd and said playfully,""Let's go and have some fun together, why not? Since I'm already here, this King is still considered half a landlord. If I don't give you any face ... It's not appropriate, right?"At this moment, huntian Daoist looked at the human King. After a long while, he smiled and floated into the air. His voice was calm."Human King, this is a place for Dao discussion. Since we're here, there's no need to fight so fiercely ...""Martial arts are a must-have!" The human King sneered.As soon as he said that, the aura of the neo martial cultivators around him burst out.At this moment, the human King was extremely solemn,'there's nothing that can't be fought for! In this chaos, in this universe, who was not fighting to cross it? If you don't fight and I don't fight, would chaos still be like this? Fight for a path to survival, fight for a path to survival!""What nonsense are you saying, the great Dao has no dispute!"The human King was extremely solemn,"the martial Dao is all about fighting! The Dao must be fought! If you don't want to fight, then get lost! I hate hypocrites, they say one thing, but in reality, they're another. Since we're here, who can say that we're not fighting for it?"Huntian Daoist was stunned. He nodded slightly and didn't say anything.Martial Dao must fight!,m Fight?Of course!If they didn't fight, why did they want to dominate a region?Why did he want to unify the chaos?The human King's words were actually not wrong. However, huntian felt that fighting did not mean fighting everywhere. Was fighting for a false reputation the goal?However, there were some things that didn't need to be said in depth.At this moment, another figure floated into the air and laughed,""What a good" martial Dao must fight "! "I don't cultivate martial arts. What I'm thinking is that time must be fought! "And now, someone is cultivating time. To us cultivators, time is our greatest enemy. Immortality, immortality, immortality ... All of that is worth fighting for! It's said that time is merciless. Human King, do you think that martial arts can win against time?"The human King didn't seem to understand, or maybe he did, but he didn't care. At this moment, he laughed out loud,""I'll break through ten thousand DAOs with my martial Dao! No matter how strong time was, he was only one! So what if he could live forever? So what if he was immortal? So what if a stone could live longer than a mortal and even surpass countless cultivators? When life is bright, the fireworks will be brilliant!"The human King laughed out loud,"cultivate Shi Guang? chase Shi Guang? are you Shi Guang?" Are you famous in the boundless time? Does anyone remember you? So what if the people around you die of old age, illness, and their lifespans are exhausted, and you live forever?"

Chapter 3548 Fighting For The First Place!
The few of them had yet to enter the game of chess. At this moment, they were only communicating, but it was a Dao competition!Huntian and Chunqiu showed up one after another.At this moment, some venerable sovereigns seemed to have recognized the voice and guessed the identity of the person who had come. They were all trembling and extremely excited!This ... Was unbelievable!The heavenly Daoist sect must be crazy!He had actually attracted this group of peak-stage cultivators!As for the human King, it was just a "must-fight" title. Although he might be the weakest among them, at this moment, he was showing off his abilities. This was also the first time he had displayed his unparalleled attitude in front of everyone.What I pursue is a moment of beauty!What I want is for the chaos to know me.As long as I'm still alive, I'll fight to the end and leave behind an undying legend!"The unification of the world and the chaos great Dao have nothing to do with him. What I care about is ... To make the chaos remember me!"Remember my name, I am Fang ping!Human King Fang ping, the king of martial arts!At this moment, long Zhan soared into the air and said with a calm face,""Fight, I agree! All things had to fight. No one was born noble, no one was born to be a ruler. However, to fight, one had to be strong. To fight without strength, one was a reckless man! Human King, which type do you think you are?"The human King laughed,"which type am I?" I'm ... A disciple in adversity!"Long Zhan was slightly startled and did not continue the conversation.The human King said in a clear voice,"I have not lost a hundred battles. I have risen from the masses. I was not born noble. My life may have been short, but I have experienced the ups and downs of the tides, the storms and waves. I have been through them! Between life and death, I tried, I fought, I defended! "I, neo martial, rose up in adversity, broke through the heavens, fought for a future, fought for an unparalleled position. Even if my strength is insufficient, I'll let you bite me and spit out three liters of blood!""Fight!"The shadows suddenly roared in all directions!The neo martial cultivators didn't seem to care about other people's gazes. At this moment, they shouted.The human King must be fought!Martial Dao must fight!Discuss Dao? What do you mean discuss Dao?In the eyes of the human King, my Dao is right here!Long Zhan was silent and said,"then let me ask you. You said to fight. Everything in the world must fight. You, the Emperor of the new martial world, must also fight!" You're the king of neo martial, and they're under your command, so they still have to fight for it. If they overthrow you and take your position, it's also a fight ... What will you do?"The human King laughed again,"if you're not as good as me, why not admit it?" Just like you said, it's not an injustice to be killed because you're not strong enough! Who in this world would pity you? Who would sympathize with you? Moreover ... These people are my brothers and my brothers!"The human King laughed out loud,"I'll be the boss, and they'll be the boss. What's wrong with that?" There's healthy competition and vicious competition. The healthy one is my new martial arts, and the vicious one is you! With invasion and domination as the goal, this is a malignant act!" Long Zhan said coldly,"malignant? Do you know how many members of the chaos race have been enslaved and enslaved by others in the primordial chaos, struggling to survive? the evilness in your eyes is ... Accepting your fate?""Why do you accept your fate?" the human King shouted. Status, you fought for it. I never said that you shouldn't fight for it, you can't fight for it! They would fight with real swords and guns! What was the point of scheming against this and that? If this King has your strength, I'll kill my way out. I'll kill anyone who dares to enslave my clansmen!""Long Zhan, you're a coward and you've schemed too much, losing your courage. Now, you're quibbling with me, arguing with me, how ridiculous! With this ability, the enemy can be killed!""The death of those who enslaved my clansmen!""Those who don't give me status will die!""Death to those who block my rise!""Even if it's the chaos heavens, the spring and autumn, the five elements, or the forces under them, hand over my people. If you don 't, we'll fight to the death! They were fighting for their race. At this moment, if they helped others, they would be traitors. They would be traitors to their race and killed! For example, that Peng Cheng, an eighth level venerable sovereign, an expert of the chaos race, dares to help an outsider to enter my East. Even if I don't want to live anymore, I'll kill him and terrorize the four corners of the chaos!"“……”As soon as he said this, Feng Yan and the others who had followed him here felt their blood boil. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Yes, this should be the case.He would just kill them!"Peng Cheng didn't think much of it before, but now that I think about it, he's from the chaos race, but he's helping huntian and Samsara. You should know that the East is also the territory of the four regions.Shouldn't such a traitor be killed?p Kill him!“……”The Dragon battle was silent.At this moment, huntian Daoist was speechless. He laughed,""But Pengcheng is also a living being and has his own choices ... Why can't he choose the path he likes, why ... Must he be controlled by others? Why do you have to fight for a stranger ..."The human King laughed,"that's true. However ... The interests of a race are sometimes above all else! There's no need to be emotionless!" Of course, if long Zhan didn't care, it didn't matter. If he didn't fight for the chaos race and only wanted to dominate, then he wouldn't have the face to talk about the race's interests ... If it was for the entire chaos race, then Peng Cheng was the one with vested interests. Even if he joined chaos heaven, at the critical moment, when the race rose, he had to return to serve. If he didn't return ... He would be killed! Traitors deserve to be killed more than enemies!"“……”This guy, all he did was kill.Huntian Supreme Emperor felt that if he were to continue talking like this, he would be able to instigate the chaos race to start a war with him before the battle for the great DAOs even began.F * ck!This guy really knew how to talk.Young man, you sure have a lot to say.At this moment, long Zhan was deep in thought. He came here to exchange time rules, but at this moment, he felt some fluctuations.

Chapter 3549 Fighting For The First Place!
It wasn't that the human King's few words were really powerful to this level, but ... He had spoken to his heart.I will fight for the rise of my race!I'm doing this for the chaos race. I'm going against the heavens and changing my fate. I'm no longer going to be a Wanderer for generations, and I'm no longer going to be a slave to the human race.You don't have to do anything, but you can't make a false countercharge at this critical moment!"For example, Peng Cheng, you can serve huntian, but you must not help huntian to deal with the chaos race on the way to rise. Otherwise ... You will be a traitor of the race.There were actually many such beasts of primordial chaos, and they could be found all over the primordial chaos.Some of them were very strong, some were very weak, some took the initiative to work for various parties, and some were passive ... These chaos beings could all be recruited.To strengthen the power of our chaos race!Long Zhan pondered for a long time at this moment and suddenly opened his mouth,""I've learned!"“……”Huntian Supreme Emperor had a headache because he knew that long Zhan must have been disturbed. It was not the interference of the great Dao of the human King, but ... The human King, this fellow, looked reckless, but he was a real man.Speaking human words, speaking ghost words, these words must have reached the depths of long Zhan's heart.Even if there were people who said it normally, they did not dare to say this to long Zhan either.If the human King said so ... Long Zhan would definitely take it in.She was really a troublemaker!Chaos's sh * t stirrer, Street bumpkin, he really didn't call himself that for nothing.At that moment, the spring Autumn Emperor suddenly laughed and said,""So, the demon race is actually the same? In the eyes of the human King, we demons don't necessarily have to be controlled by others?"The human King laughed,"of course!" Wasn't all living things the same? "Of course, your demon race isn't that miserable. Why are you interfering?! The demon race also has a large number of world Lords, so it's still okay, right?""Are you worried that you have too many neo martial demons?" Chunqiu smiled.The human King sneered,"do you dare to do anything?" I admit that I might not be as strong as you, but in a life-and-death battle, don't think that you've lived for countless years and are an old demon. I've been fighting since I was weak, and I've never died in any battle. I've turned the tables and never lost a single battle. Do you ... Want to try?""I'd like to try!"The spring Autumn Emperor snorted. What a big tone!Undying in ten thousand battles?Then I'll let you die!At this moment, a light cough sounded."Seniors, this is the heavenly Daoist Rite. It's a place for discussions ... Well, it's fine to discuss the Dao with words. It's extremely inappropriate to hurt the harmony ..."After that, his voice dissipated.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  It was Li Hao. As for Li Hao, he was also helpless. He had also heard the human King's words. To be honest, he agreed with them and even felt a little excited.But ... Don't cause trouble here."You've been stirring up trouble all this time, and the other party isn't a weakling. If you really anger them and they come to fight ... It'll be a little troublesome. You can run, but my training hall has only been established for a short time. Don't cause trouble. "……At this moment, everyone else in the secret realm was silent and excited.Human King, long Zhan, huntian, spring and autumn ...Now, the Silver Moon King had spoken.It could be said that other than the five-element Overlord, the top group of people in the entire chaos were all here. At this moment, they were only exchanging words, but it was like a great battle, making them feel to their hearts 'content.The human King's words were too bewitching.Martial Dao must fight!All things must fight!To them, these words ... Actually touched everyone's heart. We are not willing to be ordinary either. Any venerable sovereign is not ordinary, but ... There are countless more dazzling people. How can we ... Be ordinary?This chaos could not light up the countless lights!We all want to fight for it, but ... Our strength doesn't allow us to."I agree with some of the human King's words," huntian Supreme Emperor said."But ... Some of them are a little too extreme. You can only take them as words of encouragement. Everyone has their own value in existence. Fighting ... Might not be ..."The human King interrupted him,"alright, I won't argue with you about this. This is what it means to not fight!" When you meet someone who doesn't agree with you, you only have one word to say to them: shut up! Oh, two words. Shut up, you're right!""I don't fight for everything. For example, now ... It's too meaningless to talk to a duck. If I'm strong enough, I'll use a big knife to get your approval!"“……”The surrounding venerable sovereigns held their breaths.Damn it, you're too arrogant.This was huntian Supreme Emperor, right?You ... You dare to be so impudent?The only level nine in the chaos!Huntian Supreme Emperor was not annoyed and chuckled,""Yes, so ... Isn't it still based on strength?"The human King nodded his head this time,"yes, that's right!" Strength is the most important, words are secondary, but you must have spirit. Without spirit, spirit, no matter how talented you are, no matter how unparalleled you are in the world, in my eyes ... You are nothing!"He seemed to be talking about someone, telling someone, or just talking about some of his own insights. He smiled and said,""In life, there are some things that you can't let go of, so ... It's lively! Every day you live is an exciting day.
