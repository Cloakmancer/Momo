This time, he had seen with his own eyes how a venerable sovereign had advanced from level six to Level Seven, not through the Dao universe, but through his own Dao network. This was different from what forest orchid master did.It wasn't that Li Hao looked down on sector Lord Sen LAN, but anyone who could reach Level 7 wasn't simple.However ... Sector Lord Sen LAN had advanced through a complete Dao universe. He wasn't the first to construct the Dao web and was only the inheritor. As for Sword Saint, he was the founder!As time passed, the sword Saint could construct a great path universe and give birth to a world, becoming a great world!To become the master of the world's creation!This was the difference.Watching such an expert level up was a huge gain for Li Hao.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  ​ He was ecstatic!At this moment, with Wu Shan and revered sword beside him, there was no need to worry about any accidents with two Grade 7 experts here.And the surprise was not over yet.At this moment, in the dark Moon world.A Black Book rose into the air.Suddenly, a Dao domain appeared, and tens of thousands of Dao appeared, covering the sky.As the pages of the book flipped, a person floated into the air. He glanced at venerable the sword but ignored him. As the pages of the book flipped, he chuckled and looked at Li Hao. "It's much easier than I expected ... Level 7 is nothing much! The structure of the Dao net is interesting. The Dao net of the longevity sword is too simple and boring. Are you interested in watching mine?"Li Hao's eyes lit up!Li Zhu laughed, and said,""Today, I've entered Level Seven ... And it's time for me to leave. Silver Moon King, it's not that I'm trying to sow discord, but you're dealing with a young master of the new martial arts world! "Especially the human King and the martial King ... The human King is actually fine, but the martial King is a pure dog-headed military counselor who only considers the interests of neo martial. There can't be two masters in the sky, so don't go to neo martial to find trouble. That grandson of the martial King can't wait for everyone in the world to become a vassal of neo martial. To neo martial, he's the Supreme, but to me, he's a bastard ..."On the other side, Zhang an did not say a word. His grandfather was not here, so he could not afford to offend this person.Besides, this man ... Sometimes, he would scold his grandfather in front of him.Forget it, I'll just keep quiet.Li Zhu laughed loudly. With a wave of his hand, heaven and earth seemed to transform into a realm. Thousands of DAOs emerged, and the web of DAOs was quickly constructed. The DAOs quickly emerged one after another, and Li Hao looked at the core one for a while and judged it ... But was a little surprised.He thought that Lizhu was good at stealing from the sky and changing the sun, and his core Dao might be extreme Yin, concealment, concealment, darkness, and so on.In the end ... It wasn 't!Tang Huang!Even Li Hao was stunned. He was truly stunned. It was a magnificent and magnificent great Dao that even had some signs of ... Being an Emperor!This ... This person ...Li Zhu smiled but didn't say anything. What was so strange about it?I am the king of the Xuanji catacombs!The next moment, the Dao net was completed and covered the core Dao. A majestic aura emerged from his body."Farewell!"Lizhu, who was in a hurry, disappeared in a flash. His voice reverberated,""Longevity sword, go back and tell Zhang Tao that the battle between us isn't over yet!"“……”Venerable the sword was speechless. He only shook his head after they left,""Neo martial ... These guys are all unruly. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing for this guy to enter the seventh tier. This guy will sooner or later find trouble with a martial King!"Li Hao was puzzled."The hatred still hasn't been resolved?" he asked."No, I didn 't,"Venerable the sword shook his head and laughed. He suddenly said, "That's good. Martial Kings are nothing. If they really fight with this guy, I'll be able to watch a great show!"At the side, Zhang an was trembling. I ... Should I speak?These people seem to want to cause trouble for my grandfather.'Fortunately, I didn't keep mentioning Grandpa. Otherwise, these guys seem to be very unhappy with Grandpa.'At this moment, two of them had advanced to the seventh step, and one of them had recovered to the peak of the seventh step. Not far away, Kong Ji was also burping, and it seemed that he had also improved a lot.Beside him, Qian Wuliang had also reached Level 4.As for Li Hao ... At this moment, he laughed. Suddenly, hundreds of realms appeared around him. With a loud boom, an aura rose from his body!He had observed two Grade 7 Dao vindication experts!If not for the fact that he had suppressed his cultivation for the sake of observation, he would have advanced a long time ago. At this moment, since the two of them had completed their advancement, there was no need to suppress it.Boom! Boom! Boom!The world around them trembled!A powerful force swept in all directions, and even Kong Ji's expression changed. This power ... Was it really only at the fifth rank?Hundreds of worlds stacked together!Li Hao's aura soared, and even Kong Ji, who was at the sixth step, felt pressure. He couldn't help but curse. This guy is improving so fast.'If I don't reach the seventh step soon, perhaps ... I'll be surpassed by him!'"I've finally reached the fifth rank!"Li Hao exhaled and laughed. He looked around and saw that the boundary around him had shrunk a lot, and its energy was almost exhausted.Beside the Four Realms, there was another realm that was very powerful.Senlan!Li Hao laughed."It's time to get to work. First, we'll drag Senlan far away ... And then ... We'll go to Tian Fang!"The group of experts quickly moved, dragging the forest world away from this place.From today on, the four worlds were completely destroyed.In the Shenglan realm, Supreme Emperor Yan Fang looked outside and sighed. After a long time, he said,""Sector Lord ... Choice, is really more important than hard work!"Reaching the heavens in a single step!He had made the right choice. Not only was Senlan independent, but her rank seven world was also stable and powerful.The moment the sector Lord returned, they wouldn't even be afraid of a grade 8 attack.This was the current Sen LAN!Before that, it would be difficult for Senlan to even stabilize her orthodoxy, much less be independent.The Silver Moon King was a rank five, the Son of God of light was a rank six peak, the sword Master was a rank seven, the mist Mountain Supreme Emperor was a rank seven peak, and the Li Zhu Supreme Emperor was a rank seven ...When this group of people gathered together, it was difficult to attack a level 8 world by force, but it was almost impossible to attack a level 7 world by force.Before this, this group of people were either useless or weak.In the blink of an eye, all of them had meteoric success.……A group of powerful venerable sovereigns dragged a world and found a very hidden place where there were almost no worlds around. They threw Sen LAN away and set up a few Dao domains that covered the sky. Soon, the group of people ran wildly toward Tian Fang.No one cared about Sen LAN anymore. It wouldn't be a big problem to leave her here.As for the venerable sovereigns in the forest orchid ... He didn't want to play with them. They were too weak.Tian Fang, they're back!Over there, there was still the half-crippled Red Moon master, as well as venerable Emperor cloud heaven who had almost killed Wu mountain. There was also the human King, the forest orchid sector Lord, and the great Dao universe ... It might be more interesting to go there!As for Lizhu, although he had run away, Li Hao felt that he had most likely gone to tianfang.Right now, if he didn't go to Tian Fang, was he supposed to help the martial King and the others attack the extreme yang world?Li Hao, who was at the fifth step, was extremely confident.Even though I'm only at the fifth step.He was probably not as strong as a seventh-rank magical beast, but at this moment, Li Hao felt that he might not lose even if he fought solitary void one-on-one.A peak sixth level venerable sovereign with six three extremes!He might not be as good as the previous venerable sword, but the gap was not too big. It was easy to imagine how arrogant Li Hao was at this moment. He felt that he could defeat a level 6 martial artist!Silver Moon was still there, so there was no way he would just leave him be.What if they were discovered by others?Although the chess pieces were covering it up, they still had to be careful of being discovered.This time, they didn't even use teleportation. They were worried that the Dao chess would fluctuate too much and be discovered, so they chose to cross the chaos.

Chapter 3031 Set A Small Goal (1)
In the chaos.The group of people moved forward quickly.At this moment, besides Li Hao and the others, Qian Wuliang had also entered Level 4. King Huai and Heaven's Fate had also entered Level 4. It had to be said that King Huai had also gained a lot this time.From level two, he quickly stepped into level four.If these two were on Silver moon's side, Li Hao would have three more mid-level cultivators.The Black Panther was almost there as well. However, the Black Panther had yet to return to the Silver Moon, and the Silver Moon world itself had not absorbed a large amount of energy. The Black Panther needed the world's cooperation, or else it should have been able to reach the fourth rank.Hong Yitang didn't absorb much energy this time, so he was still at the third level. However, with the two universes complementing each other, Qian Wuliang had made progress, and he would soon make it as well.The remaining three were Yi, Xun RUO, and Chan Xiu. None of them advanced this time. Yi had advanced to the second stage previously, while the other two were still at the third stage. Chan Xiu had also improved a little when she came.Xun RUO was a 3rd-tier Alchemist when he came, and he was still a 3rd-tier Alchemist now. Li Hao had told him that he could leave.In the end, Xun RUO did not leave.Even if he knew what Li Hao was thinking, when the four worlds of the Crimson Moon were destroyed ... Zhiruo felt that even if he had to be thick-skinned and give up, he wouldn't leave. It was dangerous, but looking at the people around him, who wasn't making crazy progress?Thus, even when Li Hao mentioned it again, he gritted his teeth and refused to leave, saying that he would die for Silver Moon ... Of course, whether he was actually telling the truth or not was another matter.Lin Hongyu was still a Rank 2 Magus. Her advancement was slightly slower, which had a lot to do with Li Hao.As for Zhang an, he had just entered the venerable sovereign realm and still needed some time to stabilize.As for his teacher, Yuan Shuo, he was currently cultivating in Li Hao's River. Whether or not he could become a venerable sovereign would have to wait and see.The last one was the low-profile second cat.This time, it had absorbed a lot of the source of the world and felt closer to reality. As for its strength ... It was hard to judge, even for Li Hao. But looking at ermao, it seemed to have gained a lot.This was a major world of the four sides, after all, and there were many, many of them.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  No one knew how strong ermao would be after materializing in the real world, not even Li Hao. Perhaps ... He would become the next emperor Cang?Who knows!Emperor Cang was an expert at the peak of the seventh step.These people were the latest fighting force of Li Hao's group.Apart from Lizhu, the two level 7s gave everyone a lot of confidence.Li Hao, on the other hand, began to think ... When they would part ways.The revered sword had reached the seventh rank. At the moment, cooperating with him would not be of much help to the revered sword. Similarly, if he cooperated with the revered sword, it would not be appropriate not to share it with him. If he shared it with him ... He could not afford to share it!There might still be a chance to cooperate with venerable sovereign Wu Shan. After all, he was aiming for the eighth rank!At present, although the other party had broken away from the cloud world and was working for himself ... He had not reached level eight and was still a little lacking. There was still a chance for cooperation, but it would depend on whether the opportunity was suitable or not.The other one was solitary ... He was at the peak of the sixth step. It would be quite difficult for this guy to reach the seventh step. He could still continue to work with Li Hao for a while.They were only cooperating!Li Hao didn't want to follow them all the time, but he also felt that there was no need for them to follow him. All good things must come to an end.Each had their own opportunities!He had never thought of gathering everyone and dominating a region. If he wanted to ... At this moment, if venerable the sword, Lizhu, Wushan, and new martial arts were to join forces, and if they could also pull in the Senlan Thearch, they would soon become a major force.But ... Who was going to take over this one?Wushan didn't want to be exploited. He gave up the world that gave birth to him. Senlan didn't want to merge with the Crimson Moon. She would resist even if she died ... Lizhu and venerable the sword even took the initiative to leave neo martial.Among this group of people, who would be willing to become someone's subordinate?From the beginning to the end ... The only people he could gather around him were Silver moon's group, and they were the only ones who still needed him at this point in time. Perhaps ... They would no longer need him when they became stronger one day.Li Hao was thinking about all these things.He had gained a lot this time. He had not absorbed the great Dao crystals, but he had already reached Tier 5. He had more than six billion great Dao crystals and more than 40 worlds ... Such a Foundation was enough to make Silver Moon rich!Perhaps, it was time for him to make a trip to Silver Moon.In addition, tianfang universe ... At this time, could it be completely opened, or rather, temporarily not opened, drive people out, and then seal it again?One thought after another kept appearing in his mind.At this moment, Wu Shan and the others also had complicated expressions.Especially Wu Shan!A moment ago, he had no choice but to give up his energy and leave Yunxiao. He had thought that his life was over, that he was crippled. In the end, Li Hao appeared at this moment and helped him recover his peak combat strength.He didn't lose anything, and he even managed to escape from the restraints of the clouds.At this moment, going back ... He had mixed feelings.In fact, there was one thing he didn't say.Yun Xiao!At this moment, the cloud world Overlord wasn't here, and the deep sea venerable sovereign was also there. He had left, but there were only two rank seven venerable sovereigns in the cloud world!If ...He didn't dare to say it!Light was similar, but he had three seventh-rank experts at the moment. They were extremely powerful. The three seventh-rank experts consolidated the light, which was actually much more stable than Yunxiao. The key was that he came from Yunxiao!If he was willing ... The two seventh level venerable sovereigns in the cloud world might ... Be killed by him directly!

Chapter 3032 Set A Small Goal (2)
It was another level-eight great cosmos!However, he did not mention it.Did Li Hao know?Wushan felt that someone as smart as the Silver Moon King would definitely know.However, he didn't say anything.Everyone seemed to have forgotten about Yunxiao. No one mentioned that two rank seven venerable sovereigns ... Were able to stabilize their territory. Even rank eight venerable sovereigns would find it difficult to break through, but what if they were to break through from the inside?Wu Shan had stayed in the clouds for too long, and he had always been a venerable sovereign who came forward to solve everything ... He was the number one person under the Lord of the clouds. Did he really not have any Foundation?At this moment, there were many venerable sovereigns in cloud sky who were willing to listen to him.In truth, Wu Shan was struggling!He was afraid, afraid that Li Hao would mention it. If that were the case, what could he do?'Another level 8 world ... This time, I'll be rich. I can even expel the cloud realm Lord and control the cloud world to become a level 8 master. But ... If I wanted to, I wouldn't have given up on energy.'The group of people hurried on their journey, each with their own thoughts.In this silence.Li Hao took the initiative to speak."The situation on Tian Fang's side is still very complicated. There are three level 8s ... Chi Yang and Dragon Lord might have arrived at this moment, but they might not have been able to enter. After all, the great Dao universe is closed. The level 8s of the square domain might be here." Everyone nodded. This was very possible.The level-nine universe had opened, and the two sides were slightly further away. However, after receiving the news, the level-eight Masters would not sit still and wait for death. They would definitely rush over. At this moment, there was a high probability that they were all waiting nearby.Or to find an opportunity to enter the Dao universe."We're not weak ... We're still okay! With senior Wushan and uncle li here, we're quite powerful ... Kong Ji and I, along with the others, might not be able to kill a seventh-step cultivator, but we'll barely be able to resist one! On our side, we barely have three level 7s. If senior Li Zhu also goes ahead of time...We'll barely have four, and we don't have to worry about level 8s. "They were not fighting on their own territory. If they were fighting on their own territory, the difference between an eighth and seventh rank venerable sovereign was not too big. Of course, there was definitely a difference.If they were fighting on their own land, then the difference would be hard to judge. It would depend on who was on home ground."I also have a goal for this trip!"Li Hao swiftly replied,"first, rescue human King and sector Lord Sen LAN. Their combined strength isn't weak. I'm only afraid that the 3 type 8 powerhouses will join forces against them!""Second, get everyone out. The tianfang great Dao universe hasn't recovered yet, and the Silver Moon is still inside. It's too unsafe for them to be here!" "Third, if there's a grudge, then take revenge! If there's a grudge, then take revenge!"Li Hao looked at Wu Shan."For example, the venerable sovereigns who provoked us before, like Qi Shui ... Kill them if you can. If you leave the enemies alive, they'll be a disaster sooner or later. You must kill them all!"He didn't mention anything about Yunxiao."One last thing," Li Hao said."Killing the red moon Lord is the best result. If not ..."Li haosen said coldly,'we still have to injure him! "An unaffiliated tier 8 is very terrifying. Once we split up and encounter him, we'll be killed too easily! Even if they couldn't kill him, they had to knock him down to the eighth rank. Even if this person maintained the power of the eighth rank, it was very unstable! We don't fear a level 7 rogue cultivator, but a level 8 rogue cultivator is too dangerous!"The crowd nodded again. It wasn't easy to achieve four goals, but it wasn't impossible.At this moment, Kong Ji couldn't help but say,""Haoyue, please satisfy me for a moment. I want to find a great world and directly destroy it!"You have to consider my request!I really want to find a great world and destroy it. The point is ... Li Hao's team showed mercy to the four great worlds before us and didn't slaughter them. Are there any great worlds that can be destroyed directly?At the cost of the destruction of a major world, his Dao of Nirvana would definitely improve.Li Hao was stunned. He glanced at him. He had almost forgotten about this man.Kong Ji seemed to understand what he was saying and was speechless!Seeing that Li Hao didn't mention him at all, he knew that this guy had been lying to him and making empty promises. At this time, he had no choice but to say,""There's a fifth point!"As he said this, he said in a low voice,'seize the heaven's side! "Activate the boundary power and drive them out. The population of the Skylands isn't that large, so we can drive them away or find a place to settle down. We'll stay in the Skylands and use it as a base. I'll destroy the Skylands. It'll be extraordinary for a rank nine world to be destroyed!""In the early years, Tian Fang was actually destroyed ... Later, someone came, and it began to gradually recover.""This way, the Silvermoon world will also have a period of development ..."He looked at Li Hao."You should know. Why didn't you mention it?"Li Hao frowned slightly."It's too difficult. Moreover ... One or two level-Sevens are not enough to consolidate the heaven's side. Even if the realm gate is closed, the heaven's great path universe hasn't fully recovered. To control it and resist the level-eight, at least many level-Sevens are needed ..."In that case, many people would be trapped here.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Kong Ji couldn't help but say,"Haoyue, we've worked together many times!" Revered sword artist and senior Wushan, our cooperation is quite pleasant ... To be honest, this time, we also feel that it was unfair to you ... We're all the same kind of people. It's not like you'll be satisfied just because you feel that everyone is satisfied!""Consolidate tianfang and temporarily seize tianfang as the benefits of your plan to conquer the four major realms ... Including the neo martial human King. His teacher has entered Level Seven, and the threat to the neo martial artists has been eliminated. Although there is still a level eight itinerant cultivator alive ... The neo martial human King still owes you one!"

Chapter 3033 Setting A Small Goal_ 3
"Sector Lord Sen LAN, it's even more so ..."He looked at Li Hao."If you want to develop, Silver Moon, you'll need to settle down for a while. I know that you haven't placed your focus on Tian Fang, but ... Silver Moon has been wandering around aimlessly. When will you have the chance to develop?"He looked at venerable the sword and asked,"seniors ... Do I make sense?" This time, we'll seize the heaven's path for Silvermoon and give it to Haoyue. We'll split the spoils of war this time, and no one will owe anyone anything! The friendship between gentlemen is as calm as water. Haoyue feels that if he takes less and everyone takes more, we will be happy. Do you two feel ... Very happy?"These words seemed to be in line with Wu Shan's thoughts. Wu Shan was still struggling. At this moment, when he heard these words, he quickly said,"Not bad! Good idea! It's difficult, but if it's not difficult...What kind of compensation is that?"He seemed to be overjoyed."That's a good idea. I also think that Silver Moon needs some quiet time to develop. I can buy some time for Silver Moon, and we can work together to consolidate Tian Fang for a while. A hundred years is not that long ..."He felt that this way, he wouldn't have to be conflicted!Otherwise, he would be in a dilemma.Li Hao had taken too little. As for the six billion great Dao crystals ... They were nothing!The great Dao universe was a true treasure!p "You can still get great Dao crystals if you think of a way. If you can 't, you can destroy some small and medium-sized worlds. Sooner or later, you'll be able to get six billion. But can you easily kill the Lord of a major world?Those things were not worth mentioning in his eyes!"Seize the heaven's path?"Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows and glanced at the crowd. He had to admit that birds of a feather flock together.His philosophy was for everyone to work together. The people working together wouldn't suffer losses, and neither would he. It was good as long as everyone was a win-win situation. It didn't matter if he took less, but with his strength, more might not be a good thing.However, he might have been wrong. He felt that it was normal for these people to take more, but these people also felt that ... Although you were weaker, the success rate was all thanks to your overall planning. If you took less, they would feel embarrassed.But before this, he had no choice but to take it.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Now, after Kong Ji said this, both Wu Shan and Sword Saint felt that it was a good idea.It was pretty good!If he could take down Tian Fang, who would only be an empty shell ... Even if it was an empty shell, a few tier 7 experts would be able to stabilize the world and give Silver Moon a period of rapid development. At the very least, he wouldn't have to wander around.He didn't need to worry about being destroyed at any time.Moreover, tianfang was a large world, and there were still some places of opportunity like the Taoist connotation. Once tianfang universe could recover, the opportunities would be even greater."It's quite difficult ..." While Li Hao was talking, Kong Ji said,"it's actually not that difficult for the Dao universe to not recover. Everyone's eyes are on the Dao universe now. As long as we can prove that the Dao universe won't recover for a while, who would fight to the death with multiple level-seven experts for an empty shell?" I'll talk to Guangming, so it's just Yunxiao, chiyang, and the Dragon field. ""Cloudsky ..."He looked at Wu Shan and hesitated for a moment before saying,"As for cloudsky ... If we can kill Deepsea, without senior Wushan, the master of the cloudsky better go back and guard the world. Otherwise ... Do you want to become the next Crimson Moon?"Wu Shan did not say anything.Li Hao also glanced at Wu Shan. Seeing that they were all looking at him, Wu Shan helplessly said,""Don't look at me anymore. To be honest, when you mention Yunxiao, it's a world that I've stayed in for hundreds of thousands of years ... But ... It's been completely separated before this! If they don't stop, then ... Kill!"At this moment, Wu Shan said in a deep voice,"I'm not really stupid!" It's just that I can't let go of my previous feelings, but Yunxiao made me give up all my energy, and I've repaid everything I can ... If you don't take the initiative to find Yunxiao, Yunxiao will take the initiative to find you ... Then we'll do what we should do!"He only had one request, and that was to not attack the cloud world.However, if the other party didn't give up ... Then he would kill them.He wasn't stupid or pedantic. It was just that even though he had cut ties with her previously, he didn't have any intention of taking revenge. The previous time, they had completely broken up.Hearing this, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.In fact, he was under a lot of pressure before.The main thing was that everyone was working together, so it was not good to directly say that they were going to deal with Yunxiao.At this moment, venerable the sword suddenly said,"there's no need to worry about the Scarlet sun region. The territory of the new martial artists should have already arrived at the Scarlet sun region. They might make a move soon. It might not be the Scarlet Sun World. After all, it's a rank eight major world. It might be the Scarlet Sun World of the Scarlet sun region ... Once the new martial artists break out and attack the Scarlet Sun World, the master of Scarlet sun will retreat no matter what. He'll be worried that the new martial artists will attack the Scarlet Sun World after they break through the Scarlet Sun World!"Everyone's hearts moved when they heard this."So the Dragon field is the only problem left?"Sword Saint nodded and said,"however, the Dragon field is far from here." Second, it's said that there's a Vajra realm in the Dragon field, which is also a sun realm. After breaking through the scorching sun realm, if the new martial artists announce that they're going to attack the Vajra realm, the Dragon field will have to go back and defend it!""Then neo martial will be the target of public criticism ..."When Li Hao said this, venerable the sword looked at him strangely."You think ... It's not the case now?"“……”Silence.Venerable the sword laughed,"a level Seven macro world. How many have you seen running around?" There were too few tier 7 great worlds that could run around at any time. In fact, Emperor Cang was already a huge threat when he ran around with a neo martial! Only Beasts of Chaos above the seventh rank can easily take a great world with them ... In fact, some of the Beasts of Chaos in the Dragon field are very strong and can do it ... But none of them can do it as easily as Emperor Cang. "

Chapter 3034 Set A Small Goal (3)
Emperor Cang was considered an extremely special product.It could bring the new martial and run around freely without any aura leaking out, which was terrifying.If silver Moon wanted to do this, the prerequisite was that Black Panther could enter the seventh step, and it might not be as well hidden as Emperor Cang.Otherwise...They could only drag and drag it. In such a large world, the aura fluctuations were so strong that it would be difficult to even conceal it.Therefore, the fact that neo martial artists could run around freely was already a fatal threat to some of the macro worlds.Otherwise, it would not be so simple in the Hongyue region. Many great worlds had joined forces to destroy neo martial.Li Hao said that neo martial arts would become the target of public criticism ...Venerable the sword felt that it had long been the case.There was no need to worry about this at all!At this moment, Kong Ji also laughed. He was satisfied that his suggestion had been approved. "That's right, brother Hao Yue, what are you afraid of? "At this point ... If you take over the heaven's side and let the Silvermoon cultivators cultivate there, they'll comprehend the great world Dao and become a true level nine world. Very soon, everyone in Silvermoon will become experts, and the great Dao universe will develop rapidly. You won't lack great Dao crystals either. Just burn them and satisfy your cultivation. Not to mention becoming a level Seven great world, becoming a level six great Dao world will be a piece of cake!""This way, Silver Moon can accommodate more venerable sovereigns, similar to Senlan's ... Because of the two Dao universes, it can even accommodate twice as many venerable sovereigns as Senlan!""Only by doing so will Silver Moon be able to develop at a high speed. Otherwise, how many years do you think it'll take for him to reach the seventh step if he's so sneaky?"Li Hao glanced at them."It's not that I'm being pretentious. I just feel that ... This way, for everyone ..." He said."Let's not talk about other things. We're not doing anything. To be honest, it's uncomfortable to hold the things!" "Although I killed two seventh rank venerable sovereigns with venerable sword, in fact, without me ... You all failed? I've taken an entire rank 7 world, and I can't feel at ease!"Hearing this, Li Hao thought for a while, smiled, and nodded.""Alright!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  This group of people actually had ideas about Tian Fang.If he wanted to take down Tian Fang and make it a grinding spot for Silver Moon, would it be appropriate for a Tier 4 world to use a tier 9 world as a temporary residence and grinding spot? It was very suitable!Borrowing the chicken to lay eggs!It just so happened that the other party's Dao universe had been destroyed. That was good. The two Dao universes would temporarily act as tianfang universe and would not be affected at all.It was very difficult!However, so what if it was a little bigger?"Then this time ... We'll take down Tian Fang!"Li Hao laughed. At this moment, King Huai and the others couldn't help but feel a little excited. They were fine, but Qian Wuliang was already a little impulsive. He even thought that if they could invade Tian Fang ... Then ...Alright, I don't dare to think about it!This was a shell. Whether or not it would succeed depended on strength, luck, and planning. However, the current situation seemed pretty good. After some consideration, Li Hao realized that this was indeed a great opportunity for Silver Moon to develop!If he could succeed, it would be a heaven-sent opportunity for Silver Moon!After setting a few small goals, the group of people sped up again.This time, everyone had a goal and was even more excited.……Tianfang world.There was a group of venerable sovereigns, and at this moment, many of them were standing guard.There were also several powerful auras in the entire tianfang world. Two of them were level 8 auras, and they shook the entire tianfang world. There were also several Level 7 auras who were too hungry to enter. They each guarded their own places, feeling very regretful.They were one step too late!In the end, the others entered first. The great Dao universe was sealed, and they could not find any traces of it. However, they were not willing to leave. They were also worried that someone would take down the tianfang great Dao and completely become a level nine!That would be troublesome.They were all waiting for the results. Whoever took down tianfang universe ... The seventh-level ones were still fine, but the eighth-level ones would definitely be the target of public criticism. They would not tolerate anyone becoming a ninth-level venerable sovereign!The four-sided domain, which had been ownerless for many years, might have an Overlord!"Old dragon!"At this moment, at the place where the gate of the great path universe had been opened, a will suddenly descended. An illusory figure of an expert like the scorching sun appeared. The Scarlet sun hung in the sky, and he was extremely powerful.In the next instant, an aura that seemed to be able to tear apart the heavens and earth appeared. A powerful Dragon that looked like a Golden Dragon appeared and said in an ancient voice,""Chi Yang, you have an idea?""A little."The venerable sovereign, who was like the sun, said with a burning voice,""Let's work together with the other Level Seven masters and see if we can lock onto their position. We can directly break through the great Dao universe and enter it. If this continues ... Once those few people seize the tianfang great Dao, it will be a fatal threat to you and me!""You can lock on?""I couldn't before, but now ... Not necessarily! There's also a seventh level venerable sovereign in the Crimson sun realm. As long as we can lock onto his position, we can use him as a medium to break through the wall of the heavenly great Dao!"The Dragon Lord considered it for a moment and said,"I don't have any objections!" But ... If it still fails ..."Venerable red sun sneered,'if I fail, I'll ... Attack cloud, Red Moon, and light and force them out! If we can't get it, they can't get it easily either. It's very difficult to attack by one side, but if you and I join forces, they'll naturally consider whether to come out or continue!"In any case, he couldn't tolerate a few rank eights trying to take over tianfang universe.Now, the eighth step was the king, and everyone dominated a region.

If any of them entered the ninth-rank, they would not be happy."Let's try to break open the great Dao universe first. Otherwise, when that time comes ... We'll have to shed all pretenses of cordiality!"It wasn't that they couldn't join forces to attack, but if they did, the level 8 overlords, who had been relatively peaceful before, would soon fall out completely. At that time, it might become a chaotic battle for the entire four-sided region.However, he had no choice but to do so.The red Cloud sect and the red moon sect only had one or two rank 7s guarding them. It would not be too difficult to seize them, provided that the rank 8s did not return.However, venerable sovereign Chi Yang continued,'from the looks of it, the tianfang great Dao hasn't fully recovered yet. Otherwise, there should have been some great Dao fluctuations, but I didn't sense them at all! It's a problem as to how it was opened before. Perhaps it has something to do with venerable the sword and the Dao chess. It might not be that the great Dao universe has really recovered. If it hasn't ... I'm afraid those guys will come out soon. "Over the past few days, they had also made some judgments and felt that the tianfang great Dao universe had yet to recover successfully.Otherwise, why was there no fluctuation of the tianfang Dao in the tianfang world?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  As they were discussing, venerable sovereign Chi Yang suddenly frowned. On the other side, the Dragon Master was also slightly confused.At this very moment!Many auras appeared within the tianfang world and they didn't hide their auras. With so many people and two Grade 7 experts, how could they hide their auras so easily?"What?""Wushan?"The two of them were stunned. Wu Shan?What was going on?Although they had arrived a little later, they had still managed to understand the situation that day. Wu Shan had given up all his energy and was eventually taken away by the divine Son of the divine light plane, Ming Tang, and left Tian Fang.But now ... Wu Shan was ... At the peak of the seventh rank?Recovered?The two of them were stunned!How was this possible?It was no small matter to recover all the power at the peak of the seventh rank. Otherwise, Yunxiao, who was a master of the eighth rank, would not have insisted on leaving behind the power of great DAOs. There were too many!Without a level-seven universe, it would be hard to fully recover.The divine light realm?They were all rather solemn. Could it be that the divine light plane had paid an enormous price?It must be known that the divine light plane had a treasure called the origin of light. It was said that it could only help those at the fifth or sixth step recover. Those at the seventh step were completely different. Could it be that the divine light plane still had some other hidden treasures?If that was the case...It could be explained. But was the divine light plane really willing to pay such an enormous price to help Wu Shan?Wu Shan didn't want to stay in the clouds, but could he stay in the light?In addition ... There was also a seventh-grade cultivator!A wandering cultivator?There were no fluctuations of the great path universe. In the chaos, there were no level Seven itinerant cultivators, unless the great world was destroyed and they had to become itinerant cultivators.Swordsman?The first person he thought of was venerable the sword. However, venerable the sword was only at the sixth level. Moreover, it was difficult for a sixth level like him to advance. It was said that venerable the sword was the first to enter the great path universe. As for a Tier 6 like Kong Ji and a Tier 5 like Li Hao ... The two tier 8 Masters directly ignored them.They were confused, mainly by Wu Shan and Sword Saint.One's recovery was too strange!One of them was actually a wandering swordsman, and a level Seven one at that ... It was somewhat unbelievable. What was going on?At this moment, they were not the only ones who had noticed it.There were also a few Grade 7 Masters who noticed something weird. There seemed to be someone among them who was familiar with Wu Shan. At this moment, he sent a voice transmission over."Brother Wushan ... What are you ..."How did he recover?He couldn't believe it!"I ate a level 7 world, so I naturally recovered!" Wu Shan replied calmly.“……”Everyone was stunned. He had eaten a level 7 great world?Which one?How come we didn't know?Also ... You make it sound so simple, as if a Tier-7 great world is worthless.Also, you're here now ... To take revenge on the Lord of the clouds?However, the other party was at the eighth step and had yet to come out.Even if you've recovered, you're no match for him.However, Wushan also wanted to rope in a seventh step swordsman. This way, it would be hard to say. Two seventh step swordsmen, and swordsmen were famous for their strong combat power ...At this moment, the news of Hong Yue's destruction had yet to arrive.The venerable sovereigns of the four worlds were almost all killed.Those who didn't die and those who escaped were few in number. They didn't dare to escape in the direction of Tian, but in the opposite direction. The news was cut off, and only a few people in the great path universe knew about it."Brother Wushan, this sword cultivator is a little unfamiliar ... When did a level Seven sword cultivator come to the primordial chaos?"Someone still asked, somewhat suspicious.Where did this person come from?Even those who had seen Li Hao impersonating the sword venerable before did not dare to connect the two together. The main reason was that the two were actually different. The sword venerable Li Hao impersonated did not have much in common with the current one.The key lay in the seventh-rank Pixiu!A Grade 7 swordsman was different from a Grade 6 swordsman.Wu Shan smiled."He's an old friend of mine. I met him in the chaos in the past. Today, he found out that I was injured and deprived of my power. He came here specially to get back at me!" If you don't want to get into trouble, I suggest you leave as soon as possible!""Tian Fang's great Dao universe hasn't completely recovered! Before this, it was actually just a trap! You'll know very soon that tianfang's great path universe is still dead and silent. It's only opened by using the Dao chess pieces!"

Chapter 3036 Set A Small Goal (3)_6
As soon as he said this, the two tier 8 experts who had been listening by the side couldn't help but burst out.Suddenly, a scorching force swept over.""Wushan, is what you said true? A trap? Who laid this trap? Who are you going to deal with?""Is it venerable sovereign Chi Yang?" Wu Shan asked with an indifferent expression. You'll all find out who set this up and who they're dealing with very soon! You don't need to worry about anything. It's impossible for someone to take the opportunity to reach level nine! "This time, tianfang universe is just a graveyard. Many Level Seven venerable sovereigns are buried there ... When it opens again, you'll know how many Level Seven venerable sovereigns have died this time ... I took the opportunity to devour a great Dao universe before I recovered my power!"Everyone was shocked!Who died?More than one had died?Wushan's recovery ... Was actually related to this matter. So, he was one of the participants, one of the schemers?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  In that case ... This swordsman was the same?Wu Shan continued,"everyone, if you have something to say, just say it. Before the great Dao universe opens, I'm not afraid to tell you ... We've all joined an extremely mysterious force in the chaos. I can't say much about the details. I can only tell you that our strength is far beyond this!""Wushan, you've been cultivating too much!" Venerable sovereign Chi Yang suddenly sneered.Who are you trying to scare?This person had recovered his strength, and he actually came to scare people.Who are you trying to scare?What a joke!What mysterious power of the primordial chaos? what a joke!"I'm just saying,"Thearch Wushan replied calmly," whether I believe it or not has nothing to do with me! I'm only warning you all that tianfang ... Is not a good place! Many people are buried here. I can only say that there are many high-level venerable sovereigns in the square region, including ... The new martial artists!"He sneered."I'm not afraid of you knowing. In addition to new martial arts, there are many people, including me and this fellow Daoist beside me!" He said. Our goal is very simple. It's not to kill anyone, but to protect ourselves ... So, you don't have to worry about anything. "At that moment, the two level eight venerable sovereigns frowned slightly.I've heard that Wu Shan and neo martial colluded. Not only Wu Shan ... But Kong Ji is also here. Could it be that ... The divine light realm is also involved?Just like red Moon master, they were all a little suspicious.Wushan's recovery was strange.They still did not know which rank seven world had been destroyed.At this moment, Li Hao didn't care what Wu Shan said.This mysterious person might really be able to fool a group of people after scaring them for a while. As for whether they would believe it or not, they would have to believe it when they knew that the square universe was gone.This time, quite a number of grade-7 experts died.Three had died in the great Dao universe, and two had died outside. A total of five Level Seven venerable sovereigns had died!Including the three that Li Hao and the others had killed, neo martial had killed two ... In two years, ten Level Seven venerable sovereigns had died. It was a huge shock to the entire chaos.The seventh rank was hard to cultivate! The 10 that died were the result of many years of hard work and accumulation.And recently, the four regions had only given birth to Sword Saint, Li Zhu, and Sen LAN sector Lord, 3 grade 7 experts. They didn't make up for the number of deaths.Li Hao observed the surroundings and said telepathically,""Two level eight, six Level Seven ... I don't know if that's all of them, but there are still eight advanced venerable sovereigns out there!"He didn't know how much he had gone in before, but Kong Ji did.Three grade-8 cultivators had entered.And Level 7, including the human King and Sen LAN sector Lord, there were a total of 16.There were a total of 19 high-stage venerable sovereigns in the Dao universe ... Of course, there were 16 at most now.In addition to the eight outside, there were 24 advanced venerable sovereigns.Wu Shan, venerable sword, and Li Zhu might also be here. There were 27 high-level venerable sovereigns in tianfang world, many of whom were at level eight.If the dead were included, there were 30 of them.There were only 40 or 50 great worlds in the entire four-direction region. However, some great worlds had more than one level-seven, and there were more level-seven great worlds in level-eight universes. In the huge four-direction region, there were only about 100 high-level venerable sovereigns.This was the entire four-sided domain, which was unbelievably large!In everyone's eyes, this was the entire chaos.The distance between each great world was actually very far. It was normal for ordinary venerable sovereigns to take decades to reach it by flying.Now, about a third of them had gathered here, and all the level 8 ones were here."Are we opening the great Dao universe now?" Wu Shan replied."No rush ... I want to wait!"Li Hao said via voice transmission, the best time is to launch the neo martial art ... Logically speaking, now is the right time. If the Supreme neo martial artist notices something is wrong, he should choose this time!"It's a pity that I can't communicate with them. Otherwise, I would open the Dao universe before the new martial is launched. In this case, the experts in the Dao universe would have to come out even if they don't want to ..."The launch of new martial and the destruction of a major world might not be as big as the red moon.It was difficult to send news from the red moon. Logically speaking, it was also difficult to send news about the launch of neo martial.However ... It was impossible for neo martial to annihilate all the surrounding macro worlds. As long as the venerable sovereigns of the surrounding macro worlds checked the situation and sent it here, the news would easily spread.Li Hao checked and judged for a while, then said telepathically,""Let's wait a little longer. It's best if there's news before I open it. At that time, be it Chi Yang or the Dragon Lord, they'll all choose to leave ... This way, we'll have a greater chance!"

At this moment, he was very regretful that the communication technology was not developed.Otherwise, he could have cooperated well with neo martial this time!……At this moment.Chiyang region.At the border, an extremely hot world swept across the world.Not far away, a cat squinted its eyes and stared into the distance.Within the realm, the Supreme Being seemed to be gathering intelligence. One clone after another was transmitting back information. Suddenly, the Supreme Being opened his eyes. "It's about time!"He revealed a smile."Although it's only a seventh-rank world, once we break through and seize it successfully, there will be a large number of talents in neo martial that will return to their peak!" Rank 7, you can wait!"He looked at the venerable sovereigns in the crowd.These people had the highest chance of reaching Grade 7.Blood Emperor, King of earth, iron head Emperor, God-splitting Emperor, heavenly suppression King, God casting emissary, human Queen ...They had great hope.Furthermore, the Yang Qi was not weak. The human King had paid a huge price for them ... Fine, the king of earth actually did not have enough Yang Qi. Perhaps, the king of earth had the best chance.He raised his head to look at the sky and chuckled.""Everyone ... Success will be determined today! "In addition, perhaps new martial arts also has good news to tell you. I can't judge whether it's accurate, but new martial arts ... May have given birth to a new rank-7!"The king of earth and the others had calm expressions.In the crowd, celestial pole's father, Emperor Xi, yawned and looked at the Paragon with a bored expression. 'You?'Just say it!Stop hiding, it's boring."I'm not talking about me!"Grandmaster smiled.The crowd continued to ignore him.The Grandmaster laughed again."Maybe ... It's Li Changsheng. Maybe ... It's Li Zhu!"He looked at the king of earth. The king of earth had an indifferent expression on his face. When he saw him looking over, his face was calm. Why are you looking at me?Even though that's my son ... I don't know what's going on either. Besides, you're the one who said it. Do you think I'll believe you?This son of a B * tch, do you want me to fight to the death? anyway, my son has entered the seventh rank. As a father, you should fight to the death. Even if you die, you won't lose anything.You F * cking fool me every time!The king of Earth's face was indifferent, and the Grandmaster looked at him for a long time ... For a long time, there was no sound.Forget it!I really did have some perception, but it's a pity that they don't believe me. Finally, he looked at another person ... A guy wearing flower underpants. This was the famous sun god from the chaos ... Actually, compared to him, the human Kings were considered normal. This person ... Was the abnormal one.All year round, he would wear floral shorts, hold a large coconut, and drink endlessly!He was only missing a Beach Beauty!"Senior Sun god, this battle ... I'll have to trouble you!"Sun god looked up at him, then at the big cat above his head. He smiled.""Zhi Yang is quite powerful. He's a Lord of the seventh rank and has the combat power of a peak seventh rank! It'll be hard to break through if you defend your homeland, but ... You and this big lazy cat should be enough ...""Senior must be joking."  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The Grandmaster sighed."Without you, senior, we can only borrow Fang Ping's strength. I'm just afraid that he's in danger now. Once we borrow his strength, he'll be dead!"Sun god chuckled and said nothing more.Zhang Tao, martial King, Supreme martial artist ...Anyway, this guy was like this every time. He was not likable in new martial arts, but ... Forget it, I won't argue with him.This guy never spoke the truth.,m Even the new martial arts practitioners did not understand him, let alone the enemy. It was because of this that new martial arts could reach its current level. Who knew how many hidden cards this guy had?This guy was the real new Martial Emperor!The people were strong, he was strong.A neo martial artist had accumulated strength for thousands of years. Who would believe that he wasn't strong?The human king and emperor Cang were the masters of the world and the great Dao. This guy ... Could be considered a master who was not a master. The human King had not cut off his path of the human Emperor until now. This was the scarier part. Fang ping, that kid, had actually watched this guy become stronger with his own eyes. Was he not afraid that this grandson would sell him out?As the sun god was thinking, the Supreme martial artist laughed."Alright, the time is almost right. Then ... Let's take action!"In an instant, dozens of venerable sovereigns swarmed out.Cang Mao immediately shifted the world and rushed towards the scorching sun World. He could eat fish again ... Speaking of which, er Mao seemed to have become much stronger recently. He could actually sense the other party's existence. Was it about to become real?I didn't prepare much dried fish!It felt so fast. After a yawn, it seemed like second cat was going to return to him!"I'm fishing!"The big cat muttered, and in the next instant, an expert appeared in the distance. The moment he saw the big cat, he roared,""Neo martial is attacking, fight! Request for help!"Beg who?The Crimson sun World, of course.Something bad had happened. A new martial artist who was wandering around the Crimson Moon region had actually appeared here.In an instant, the battle broke out.The heavens fell and the earth cracked!

Chiyang region.The battle instantly erupted in the scorching sun World.Some of the major cosmos absolute beings around them also sensed the change. When they saw a huge cat, like a star, pressing down on the scorching sun great cosmos ... They were instantly enlightened.Neo martial, attack!In an instant, these world Lords didn't think of rescue, but escape. They wanted to escape with their worlds. If it was difficult to escape, then they would ask for help. Neo martial was quite famous in the square region.He had once destroyed two Grade 7 worlds in a day, but now, who dared to fight him head on?Soon, someone sent a message to the leader of the Scarlet sun region, the Scarlet sun realm, asking for help.As the boss of the region, now that the new martial artists of the Redmoon region had taken the initiative to attack ... They naturally needed an eighth level venerable sovereign to take action. Although they knew that venerable sovereign Chi Yang seemed to have gone to tianfang, the Redmoon region did not only have one eighth level venerable sovereign. There were many seventh level venerable sovereigns.The scorching sun great world might not be able to hold on, but the surrounding venerable sovereigns could at least wait for reinforcements.At this moment, a giant that was as big as the sun floated in the sky and roared,""Why did the new martial artists attack our scorching sun World?"Bai asked.In the chaos, there was no right or wrong. There was only the strong and the weak. It was the law of the jungle.But ... He was unwilling!Why did you attack us?"There are so many great worlds. Why did you come to the chiyang region instead of the great world of the Redmoon region?"A book of Dao appeared.The pages of the book blotted out the sky and the sun, as if they were suppressing the sun.An old man emerged from the book and looked at the scorching sun Master. He said softly,""There's no reason or reason. This is an invasion! They would either hand over their great path universes and worlds or be killed on the spot! If you give up the great Dao, you can keep your life. If you leave the great Dao and preserve the power of the Heavenly King, the world will survive without the venerable sovereign!"This time, the Grandmaster didn't find any excuses or reasons.It was invasion!He was so direct.It was because neo martial needed it.That's why we're here.At this moment, he was too lazy to make up reasons and excuses. Neo martial was already a sh * t stirrer in the eyes of many worlds, so he should stir up more trouble.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The scorching sun Master was furious!However, at this moment, with the appearance of the sun god, Emperor Cang, and this neo martial Supreme, he couldn't see through the situation. Although the scorching sun World was strong, it had the advantage of being native.But ... He wasn't confident that he could stop them.The world of crimson sun was still very far away from here, and they might not be able to make it in time. Moreover, the master of crimson sun was not here, but had gone to tianfang. Without his permission, the people from the world of crimson sun might not come to help.He gritted his teeth and roared,"this is the chiyang region, not the Hongyue region!" If you dare to invade the scorching sun today, all the major worlds in the four-sided domain will be your targets the next day!" "And then?"The Grandmaster looked around and said softly,"no matter how much you say, there are only a few seventh-rank cultivators in this world ... Do they dare to come and get involved?" This time, we took the initiative to invade and give you a chance. Leave the great path universe, give up the power of a venerable sovereign, and keep the power of a Heavenly King ... Otherwise, I'll kill you without mercy!""You guys ..."The Autarch sighed softly,"there's no need to talk about anything else. Who in the chaosverse hasn't experienced a period of constant invasion and being invaded? How many worlds have you invaded now that you've reached the seventh step? In the chaos and disorder, no one should use morality to restrain or suppress anyone. The only difference is ... Who is strong and who is weak!"The scorching sun Master was slightly taken aback, and he suddenly fell silent.He was no longer as angry as before.Before this, he couldn't accept it and lost control of his anger, but at this moment, he suddenly calmed down.There was nothing wrong with the words 'Supreme neo martial'.​ Chaos and disorder!"It's nothing more than being strong or weak. If I want to invade you, I don't need a reason. As long as I'm strong and confident enough, and I'm not afraid of causing others to fear me or being besieged ... Then I'll let you invade me.The scorching sun Master regained his calm and glanced at the crowd. After a moment, he shouted,""Then kill this Lord! If you want to seize the great Dao, kill me first, then talk about the great Dao!""As you wish!"The Grandmaster didn't say anything else. With a single book, he suppressed the heavens and earth. Tens of thousands of DAOs appeared, and a Dao web was woven. It was as if a Holy domain had been created out of thin air!A fishing rod suddenly appeared in Emperor Cang's claw.It was extremely huge!Fishing rod to catch the sun!It wasn't fishing. In the void, great DAOs were fished up, and the entire great Dao universe appeared. It was the scorching sun great Dao universe, full of Yang Qi, and countless great Suns covered the universe.However, at this moment, one great Dao sun after another was fished up by it.Not far away, the sun god chuckled and punched out. The void shattered as if the world had collapsed. At this moment, a huge word, as if woven from thousands of paths, pressed down!Suppressing heaven and earth!The new martial heavenly suppression King was the best at the Dao of suppression, and the heavenly suppression King ... Was the disciple of the sun god!Obviously, the sun god was also good at the way of suppression. A character was like a mountain that suppressed the surroundings, and the world seemed to be suppressed.The peak rank seven scorching sun Master had the advantage of being native, with the world and the great path universe behind him.However, at this moment ... He felt boundless pressure and danger.Emperor Cang did not borrow the power of the human King to come.But now, they seemed to be more powerful than when they attacked the Elysian world last time.The other venerable sovereigns of new martial arts directly bypassed them and began to break through the realm gate. In the scorching sun World, a group of venerable sovereigns also rushed out angrily. There were several peak sixth-rank venerable sovereigns.However ... A long arrow pierced through heaven and earth, directly piercing through a sixth stage venerable sovereign and nailing him in the void. It was a shocking sight!

Chapter 3039 Abnormally Strong (2)
Venerable sovereign scorching sun had originally hoped that the venerable sovereigns under him could defeat the venerable sovereigns of new martial arts with the help of the geographical and human advantages. However, he soon realized that he had been overthinking.Not only that, Emperor Cang also waved his fishing rod. At that moment, the fishing rod pierced through the world. With a casual wave of his hand, a venerable Emperor was fished up, along with the stars of the great path in the great path universe. They were all fished into a small fish pond in front of Emperor Cang.Emperor Cang yawned as if he was really just fishing.The scorching sun Thearch was like a giant sun, constantly erupting and scorching the entire Primal Chaos. However, at this moment, he simply couldn't put up much of a resistance as he was suppressed by the Joint Forces of the sun god and the Supreme-being!"You ... You're a tier 7!" Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Supreme Emperor Zhi Yang gritted his teeth as he looked at the vague figure in the book. He was also a seventh-rank?A seventh-tier universe had actually given birth to three seventh-tier venerable sovereigns ... No, four.Emperor Cang, human King, sun god, and ... This Supreme martial artist was also a rank seven.Four rank seven venerable sovereigns!Besides the lack of an eighth-level, neo martial was no different from an eighth-level universe. The power of a middle-stage venerable sovereign was not much worse than that of some eighth-level universes. On the contrary, there were many sixth-stage venerable sovereigns who were unparalleled in strength.The blood Emperor's arrow was almost a one-hit kill.There was a coffin floating behind the king of earth ... It seemed to be made of billions of coffins. When the blood Emperor killed a venerable sovereign, the coffin absorbed everything before the other party's Dao marks could revive.As the saying goes, since ancient times, no one knew of the strong, only the wind and clouds left their names!The king of earth, Daoist Fengyun!The Father of Lizhu!In the new martial era, the ancient existence that fought against the heavenly Emperor, the four kings of one sect.There were hundreds of millions of coffins on his back, all of which formed an enormous coffin. If you looked closely ... You would see that this wasn't a coffin at all. It was a net of DAOs.Once the coffins were out, they would be buried in heaven and earth!The aura of the netherworld was rich, and it seemed like there was a big world inside the coffin-the netherworld!He had once died, and he had once controlled the netherworld.After being resurrected by the human King, he had been carefree all day long, as if he had aged. But today, for some unknown reason, he had once again revealed his extraordinary power.A coffin, buried in heaven and earth!"No one in the universe knows, only I, Feng Yun, leave my name!"The king of earth laughed carefreely, and the coffin swept across the sky. One by one, the venerable sovereigns were sucked into the coffin with horror and fear in their eyes, disappearing completely.Emperor Cang was a little displeased ... The old man, the king of earth, was sucking too fast.It hadn't caught many yet.At this moment, there was only despair in his heart.With three level-seven masters suppressing him, the other venerable sovereigns in the realm were no match for the neo martial artists. Even those of the same level were easily suppressed. If this continued ... The scorching sun would only be destroyed.At this moment, he suddenly felt an inexplicable fear.Over the countless years, the searing Sun World had swallowed many worlds. However, it was easily defeated by a world of the same level. He couldn't understand it. "You ... Shouldn't be a rank 7 world!"There was even the birth of a rank-8 who might be stronger than ordinary rank-8 worlds. These people were too terrifying among those of the same rank. A neo martial artist who had walked out of the chaos for less than a thousand years. Why ... Would there be so many monstrous talents?"Yin-yang world ..." It was unusual!Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for this to happen. There were only so many opportunities and so many monstrous talents in a world. However, the yin-yang world seemed to have produced many different monstrous talents.Why was it like this?The scorching sun Thearch couldn't understand!It was normal for one or two peerless geniuses to gather the essence of heaven and earth. However, this group of people in front of him were all extremely talented. The king of Earth's coffin Dao net, the blood Emperor's net of ten thousand arrows, and the few rank seven experts in front of him ... All of them were extraordinary!At that moment, the pages of the Supreme Being's book of Dao split apart. On each page, a Supreme Being seemed to appear.Every one of them seemed to be very powerful!A bamboo pole appeared in the book of Dao.Books were the path of enlightenment.The bamboo stick, or the pointer, was the true martial Dao."Still not giving up?"Countless Supreme martial artists spoke at the same time, and in the next moment, all of them attacked at the same time. They all held teaching whips in their hands, and their soft shouts were like the evening drums and morning bells, rumbling loudly."Then ... He deserves to be killed!"BOOM!The whip turned into thousands of DAOs, and a net of great Dao appeared instantly.
