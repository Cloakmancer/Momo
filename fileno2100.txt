Everyone was stunned.He had never thought about this question.Li Hao had never thought about it.Yes, he knew that he was very powerful. Previously, heaven battling city had also been teleported away, but that was an entire city, and in fact, it was a divine weapon. Now, it was just an ordinary city ... Teleporting it away would be an ordinary problem.Moreover, there were still people involved.The buildings weren't that sturdy either.It couldn't fluctuate too much, otherwise, the earth would shake and the buildings would collapse, comparable to the collapse of the sky.Director Wang said,"Lord Marquis, this way, there's no need to migrate back in the future. We can just fill the four Seas!" After dividing it well, he could move half of the eastern continent and fill up the eastern sea! In fact, only half of the eastern continent has been moved to the East Sea. From now on, the eastern continent and the central continent have been completely connected. Of the five continents, only the four continents are left!""The other half doesn't need to be touched.""Furthermore, there's another benefit to this. It'll form an entire continent. In the future, if there's a change in the weather or if we encounter a powerful enemy, it'll be easier to defend ...""Teleport cities?" Li Hao was confused."Even half of the eastern continent has more than 300 cities ..."Director Wang nodded,"a lot!" However, if the speed is fast, moving 30 a day is actually just a matter of 10 days. 10 days is just enough for us to fight while retreating, giving the great wilderness some time. The spread of chaos also requires time. ""This time, the Marquis can even use the sky screen to open it to the four continents again ... To shock the people! Win over the hearts of the people! No matter how strong an expert is, no one actually has much of an idea, but if ... Thirty cities are moved in a day and the East Sea is leveled, I dare say that with such an effect, no one will dare oppose Lord Marquis other than those unpardonable criminals!""There's one more thing that Lord Marquis didn't consider. After Lord Marquis moved the city away, the eastern half of the continent became barren. Hurricane city must be near the great wilderness, but we don't know its exact location. However, when there's nothing in the surroundings, there will definitely be a huge commotion when Hurricane city moves ... In order to avoid us, Hurricane city can only choose to stay far away from the great wilderness!""Otherwise, if Da Huang feels that it is no match during the battle and the wild beasts have nowhere to go, it will be a huge problem if it leads the experts of Hurricane city into Da Huang again!""But if there's nothing around, with red dust's personality, he wouldn't dare to reveal the location of Hurricane city. He would probably move away from Hurricane city, or even leave the eastern continent!" Director Wang said seriously.Li Hao's eyes moved.He had considered this before, but he was also betting that the great desolation beast would not dare to enter Hurricane city!However, if the great desolate beast was really going to die, would it still care?Li Hao gambled that when the great desolate beasts came back to their senses, he would have already dealt with them. At that time, he would directly escape into the bright star sector. If red dust really entered the chaotic region, he would not be afraid of him.However, director Wang's words made it safer."But a city is very big, and it's very troublesome to move it ..." Li Hao said after some consideration. "Set up the formation!"Director Wang said,"use the array to stabilize it. All we need is multiple suns and moons to stabilize the surroundings. Lord Marquis, use your power to lift the city and dig out the ground!" Of course, they had to dig very deep, or they would sink into the East Sea! In the future, this place ... Could become an ocean! This way, we can even prevent the invasion of the great wilderness and the spread of chaos, causing the wild beasts to become stronger ... There are no people and no land. When the great wilderness invades, the wild beasts will not gain much. "Hearing this, Li Hao's heart moved again. He nodded his head.This method was not bad, but it was a little ... Useless!That's right, he could imagine the consequences of moving 30 big cities in a day. He ... Might be dead tired.But now, he was the strongest, and the Saints of the ancient city couldn't appear rashly.Then he had to do it.Each time, it was probably a battle.On the 10th day, 300 cities were moved ... What an incredible result.Director Wang continued,"Lord Marquis, also, announce to the public that there's no need to mention the great wilderness invasion. Just say that in order to merge the five continents, we need to move the eastern continent into the eastern sea. The people won't be afraid. They will only feel shocked and incredulous. Treat it as a wonderful journey and not a refugee escape ... As long as we can deal with the great wilderness, everything will be fine!" no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  "Public opinion is now under our control. We've won, so we can say whatever we want!"Li Hao suddenly smiled.Interesting!Director Wang had rarely raised any opinions before. At most, he would introduce a few neo martial artists when he met them. Today, he took the initiative to raise his opinions and ideas.At this moment, director Zhao and the others nodded.This is good!Although he was a cripple, he was still a cripple of Li Hao ... Cough, cough, Li Hao's great strength, so he wouldn't care.The unification of the five continents was also an extremely great and unbelievably huge project in the past 100000 years after neo martial.At this moment, director Zhao nodded his head,"I think this will work!" Additionally, it would not waste people's money or cause social turmoil. As long as we make a good plan, our neighbors would always be in the same position as before. Even the neighboring cities would still be the same, except that they would be in the secondary east instead of the easternmost part. Border control has become the limit of the eastern continent ...""In this way, we will be able to connect with the central region. It will be of great help to the subsequent management, the promotion of education and Culture, and the construction of the transportation system of the entire continent!"

2101 Chapter 355
"I think it's not a bad idea to solve these problems while fighting. You can ... You can also train Lord Marquis's body!"Go to hell!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly wanted to curse. When he asked them to move, they thought it was too difficult and that it would consume too many resources. Now ... Upon hearing that he was going to move the city, they even said that they were going to train their bodies.Want it?"Director Zhao is almost at the 7th level of the sun Moon realm, his combat strength is not bad ...""Director Zhao, if you cooperate with some experts, you can also move a city, right?" Li Hao said calmly.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùDirector Zhao was a little embarrassed, but he quickly said,"Maybe I can, but ... I'm not strong enough. If I'm not careful, the mountains will collapse, the city will collapse, and countless people will die. In this world, only Lord Marquis can safely transport a large city to the East Sea. "This was true, but this guy was also a bastard.Li Hao thought for a while and nodded. That's it then! Regardless of the result, it was necessary to keep the eastern continent far away from the great wilderness in case they were invaded by the enemy! Moreover, director Wang is right, we can force Hurricane city to not dare to appear nearby!"If Hurricane city appeared, Li Hao's group might not be able to break into it, but they could still completely seal it!If the clone could not come out, and could not return, then the entire Hurricane city would be in trouble.At that time, with Hong Chen's scheming personality, he would not be able to sit still.Moreover, it would be extremely disadvantageous for their next operation.Therefore, after all the cities disappeared, Hurricane city didn't dare to stay here any longer, because it was too conspicuous. Even underground, every movement would cause some fluctuations. Now, because there were many cities and people, and Li Hao's group didn't have the mood to investigate everywhere, Hurricane city dared to stay nearby.Li Hao thought to himself, feeling a little helpless.I just moved heaven battling city. Good Lord, does everyone know that I can move cities now?This time, you want me to move 300 big cities!Although it was definitely not as big as heaven battling city, but ... The difficulty might be higher.Li Hao took a deep breath and said,""Then, from today onwards, we'll spread the word that in order to unite the five continents, in order to defend against powerful enemies, in order to deal with the series of wars that are to come ... I'm going to move the city! Tell all the residents who are moving to the city to return home on the day of moving ... As for the residents in the nearby towns ... This is easy! Although there are many towns and villages, there aren't many people. Every time we move a big city, let the warship follow, and the warship is responsible for moving the residents of the nearby towns and villages!"Everyone nodded.It had been a troublesome and almost impossible task, but now, since Li Hao was going to try to migrate half of the continent with his own power, he would have to bear it.Li Hao, on the other hand, thought of blood Emperor.That's a true omnipotent expert!With one slash, the continent was split into eight! In other words, if the other party wanted to move the eastern continent, it would not be moving cities, but ... An entire continent. Perhaps it would be lifted up in an instant. If such a person were to move and demolish the place, no one else would be able to live.Li Hao laughed bitterly in his heart as he thought about this. Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The Saints these days were a little fake.Based on what director Wang said, the Saints of the past were much stronger than they were now. Moving a city was actually very simple. They didn't even need any arrays or Undying's help. They just needed to lift the city up and do it.This also meant that the current Heavenly Kings were not to be trifled with!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the great wilderness 'side, with the great desolate King's appearance, the desolate beasts also agreed to his decision.Since you've agreed, then it's easy.As for betraying them ... The desolate beasts felt that it was impossible. Would the great desolate King dare to betray the desolate beasts?That would be the biggest news!At this moment, the battle was still going on.However, at this moment, countless sky screens appeared in all directions. This time, Li Hao's figure appeared. As director Qi and Yu Ming continued to set up the sky screens, they now covered almost all of heavenstar.Not far away from the great wilderness, there was a huge city in the East. At this moment, many sky curtains appeared."I'm Li Hao!"Li Hao's figure appeared between heaven and earth. He was as gentle and peaceful as ever."Today, the sky screen is opened because there is an important matter to inform all of heavenstar!""I want to merge the world and the four continents with the central continent. I want to fill up the four Seas and form the unique bright star continent!"‚Äã From all directions, all the people of heavenstar looked on and listened in a daze. No one said a word.Because he didn't understand!What was the meaning of this?"As we all know, the Heavenly Star is divided into five parts, with Four Seas in the middle. It's not convenient for the continents to unite, and it's not convenient for the continents to communicate. Their culture, economy, and education are all different. This has already produced a huge hindrance to the development of the entire Heavenly Star!""This is the map of heavenstar ..."Li Hao presented a huge map, and everyone looked at it in a daze. They saw the appearance of the entire Heavenly Star.Li Hao waved his hand and said,"I want to move the other half of the four continents to the four Seas. From now on, the five continents will become one, a central continent! It was also known as the bright star continent! It would completely cut off Dali, the divine Kingdom, the great wilderness, and the old land of shuiyun. It would spread the might of the Central Plains and cut off the possibility of future generations being besieged from all sides! If the four countries rise again after countless years, they will still not be able to form an alliance. They will have to cross the mountains and even the sea to besiege the Central Plains!"

2102 Chapter 355
At this moment, everyone understood and felt that it was a fantasy!What a joke.Li Hao casually waved his hand. That was half of the four continents. He was going to move half of the four continents and fill up the four Seas. Was this a joke?Li Hao continued, starting from tomorrow, the following 30 major cities will be relocated and filled up the East Ocean! There's no need to prepare anything for the ones I've named. Just stay at home tomorrow! The nearby towns, pack up your belongings ... I will move the entire city and fill it up with the East Sea!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùHe began to call out names, and the residents of some of the cities who were called were all shocked!Are you kidding me?What was going on?What the hell?Filling up the East Ocean and uniting the five Forces? everyone wondered if Li Hao was drunk.Was this something a human could say?How big was a city?You want to move the city?"That's the list of cities to be moved tomorrow ... From now on, the sky screen will be open every day. New cities will be added to the list every day to be moved! In addition, I would like to remind everyone to be prepared for sudden changes in the weather. In the eastern sea, if there is a slight cold wind, the temperature will drop a little. Be prepared to resist the cold. Everything else ... Is as usual! As for the water source, I'll also purify the seawater, so there's no need to worry about the water supply being cut off ..."He announced the news as if he was joking.At this moment, at least hundreds of millions of people were stunned.He still ... Did not understand.He understood, but he didn 't. Did Li Hao drink too much yesterday?She felt that he was just joking!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Meanwhile, in the great wastelands, everyone and the desolate beasts were stunned.It wasn't that no one could. It was because ... Li Hao wanted to relocate a city in the eastern continent.Didn't that mean that even if the great wilderness invaded, there wouldn't be an increase in population, nor would there be an increase in the number of humans invaded by the aura of chaos? didn't that mean that the benefits of the invasion would be reduced by more than half?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Similarly.At this moment, there were actually experts from Hurricane city who were observing the situation from the outside. Very quickly, the news was sent back, and even red dust was stunned.Moving a big city was something he had not expected.As a result ... The nearby area was completely emptied. Even if Hurricane city was underground, it would still be very conspicuous. It couldn't move at all. If it moved, it would be exposed.This ...Red dust frowned.He didn't think that Li Hao would do this, because he didn't think that Li Hao was afraid of Da Huang. He thought that Li Hao might fight to the death instead of choosing to relocate before the battle even began. Wouldn't this make it seem like Li Hao was afraid of Da Huang?Could it be that Li Hao was not confident in dealing with Da Huang?That's right ... After all, there were many divine path desolate beasts in the great wilderness. But ... Even if half of the eastern continent was moved, what would happen next?If the great wilderness continues to invade, will you continue to relocate? Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Where else can you move to?The world was only so big, and the more territory the great wilderness occupied, the smaller your territory would be. If you couldn't deal with the great wilderness, wouldn't your relocation be in vain?"Li Hao should understand this ...""Unless ... He wants to turn this area into a battlefield," Hong Chen mumbled."He's worried about implicating the people, so he chose to move. That's why he chose this area as the battlefield ..."He quickly displayed the map of heavenstar and compared it to the cities that Li Hao had announced today. They were moving from the eastern edge.And this was only the beginning.And where would Li Hao draw the line?He fell into deep thought.The day Li Hao stopped moving might be the day he fought against the Grand desolate plateau. So ... Why should he delay it?He fell into deep thought again.There must be some reason he didn't know, which was why Li Hao chose to delay.Turning an entire area into a battlefield ...Many thoughts appeared in his mind.He said in a deep voice,"continue to pay attention. Pay attention to Li Hao's every move. Once he stops moving, you must pay attention to him ... Moving a big city is not a miracle. It's just that he expanded the battle area for no reason. This person definitely won't do it in vain!"As for the unification of the five continents, it could indeed be a reason or an excuse ... But with a powerful enemy right next to him, why would he want to unify the five continents? unless Li Hao was really bored!Red dust kept observing the map. He was still not sure where Li Hao was going to move to. There must be some problems.Very quickly, his eyes locked onto Dingbian.Frowning slightly, he thought,"Could it be that ... They had to move to this place?'Star Town ... Damn it, is Star Town ... Related to me?'Right now, it was not easy for the clones of the experts in the city to go out. All the experts in the world had their eyes on the East. Otherwise, they could go and investigate again.The key was the base station!This was also a very troublesome problem. Li Hao's taking over of the nine base stations seemed to have little effect, but in fact, it had a huge impact. He had cut off the communication of information with some of the chess pieces they had trained outside.If he wanted to communicate with them, he could only report to them personally.The nine base stations that Li Hao had taken down with great effort before had now become obstacles for the major forces to contact the outside world.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶But Li Hao didn't care about any of this.A large number of experts began to travel to various places and set up formations in some of the cities on the list.The residents of those cities were not afraid, but they were a little confused, curious, and strange ...He didn't ask everyone to move, nor did he ask them to do anything. They just had to stay at home tomorrow.

Stopping work for a day ... Was not bad.More importantly, it was an entire city. How was he going to move?The Grand desolate plateau was also speechless, but it didn't stop them from continuing their invasion. The fewer experts on Li Hao's side, the more advantageous it would be for them to invade ... Since you want to escape with your people, we won't be polite and will just continue invading!If you run to the end, the world will shrink, but won't you still be caught up by us?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the second day.It was dawn.The sky screen was open for the entire day.Even though everyone didn't believe it, on this day, even those who were still working in other places would look out from time to time or up at the sky. The number of sky curtains had increased greatly, and they were everywhere.Let's see what our Governor li is up to.At this moment, Li Hao's figure reappeared in the sky.Soon, a large city appeared in the sky.The people in the eastern continent, especially the people in this city, would definitely recognize their own city. Some people even cheered when they saw people passing by in the sky! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Some of them even saw themselves.Nowadays, it was a great honor to be able to go to the sky screen and be seen by the whole world. At this moment, they couldn't even care about moving. It had little to do with them.And at this moment, a scene that shook the heavens and the earth happened.Li Hao suddenly roared, and his body enlarged infinitely.Ten meters, one hundred meters, three hundred meters, five hundred meters ...In the blink of an eye, a thousand-meter-tall giant covered the sky. It was even taller than all the buildings in the city, and it appeared in front of everyone like an ancient giant.Everyone was so stunned that they didn't know what to say.Li Hao's voice resounded through the world, this is the bright star Dao! With the mastery of magical powers and a thousand transformations, a thousand-meter body was nothing! Today, I will move the city to the East Sea. Residents of the city, there is no need to be afraid!"Then, giant Dragons emerged from Li Hao's body. They were all Dao meridians.In an instant, 36 giant Dragons appeared.Suddenly, the huge city began to shake.The Dragon burrowed into the ground.The city was shaking.Some people started to turn pale with shock.Li Hao's voice was heard again. He shouted at the residents of the city,""Don't worry, don't panic! They were all cultivators, so why did they have to do this for a mere shock? The city's Inspection Office, night patrollers, and townsfolk groups were responsible for maintaining law and order! Those who dared to take the opportunity to create chaos would be killed without mercy! It's right under my eyes, who would dare to cause trouble?"As soon as these words came out, the city fell silent. The giant looked down at the sky and the city. Everyone swallowed their saliva. Who would dare to make a sound?As everyone watched in horror, the city slowly rose up.The 36 giant Dragons roared continuously.To the astonishment of all the Heavenly Star citizens, an incomparably huge city rose from the ground. It was still a city, but it was floating in the air. The soil below had all been dug out. In an instant, the underground water flowed backward, and the area where the city was originally located turned into a black hole. Li Hao growled and raised his arms. In fact, there were many experts around him who were stabilizing the city.In the sky, only Li Hao and the floating city were illuminated.The world was speechless!What was this?God? Were gods that powerful?Was this even human?Li Hao's voice resounded through the world."Cultivate well. A new Dao will rise. At this moment, I've only opened 36 Dao meridians, 360 apertures, and I'm only at the ninth stage of the sun Moon realm!" Everyone can do this, there's no need to be shocked! This huge Dragon was the appearance of the Dao Meridian! Everyone is like a dragon, and everyone has great power ... Today, we will move the city into the sea and merge the five continents into one. We can wait for a few days!"BOOM!Li Hao rose from the ground and headed straight for the East Ocean with a city in his hands!At this moment, the city in his hand suddenly let out countless shouts.There was madness, fear, excitement, and fanaticism!Oh my God!We never thought that we would have such an experience one day. Originally, because we were so close to the great wilderness, everyone was worried that the great wilderness would attack us. However ... When they were really moved away and were now floating in the sky, everyone felt an incomparable shock and excitement.With the crisis of the vast wilderness gone, they could actually fly alongside a city. This was too unbelievable!Very quickly, they passed by a large city. The countless residents of the city were shouting crazily on the ground. At this moment, the city in the sky covered the sky and blocked the sun. The ground below fell into darkness, but no one was afraid.Because the canopy was still there, they saw Li Hao and the huge city flying in the sky.Countless people started shouting."Divine might of the governor!""The invincible Governor!"At this moment, countless people prostrated themselves in worship. Was this still a human?A person who had cultivated to 36 Dao meridians could actually do this?He only needed to open 360 apertures?Some of them had already opened seven or eight. It seemed very simple, but it didn't seem like they were far from 360?Originally, he didn't pay much attention to cultivation.But today, this shocking scene was deeply imprinted in everyone's hearts! They only felt that Li Hao was so imposing that he didn't seem human.At this moment, this thought was reflected in everyone's mind.He had to cultivate!360 apertures, able to move a large city, this was too unbelievable.As Li Hao soared into the sky while holding the city, his fanatical roars resounded throughout the entire Heavenly Star!

Even their voices began to turn hoarse. Countless people who saw this shocking scene from the sky were unable to extricate themselves for a long time.‚Äã When Li Hao entered the East Ocean, the huge city began to land slowly. With a boom, the city trembled and floated above the East Ocean, setting off waves that were thousands of feet high. The waves were instantly suppressed by Li Hao ... An extremely huge city actually fell quietly.In reality, landing on the ground wasn't that simple. At this moment, many powerful cultivators were suppressing the sea below. Otherwise, it would have caused a huge wave.At this moment, Li Hao actually had some feelings.He could feel ... Faith!He felt like a legend!He could feel the great Dao fluctuating.During the battle of the divine Kingdom, he had actually borrowed some of the People's strength. However, he was quickly defeated by the moon goddess that day. After that, he gave up on this idea and no longer thought about it.He no longer borrowed the power of the people!Because he knew that he couldn't be relied on.But this time, after teleporting a large city, he discovered that the entire bright star sector seemed to be shaking. Not only that, above Li Hao's head, heaven's will was sweeping, shaking, and cheering.That was because the will of the people was the manifestation of heaven's will.When everyone fervently believed in one person, even the will of heaven would be affected.It was just moving a city, but the results were much better than anything Li Hao could do. He promoted education, wiped out illiteracy, distributed seeds, distributed food, drove away powerful enemies, and annihilated them ...To everyone, it was a little ordinary and a little distant.But at this moment, Li Hao had moved the city by himself, which completely shocked the people of stellarsky.Li Hao sighed helplessly in his heart.In fact, other things were the ones that really consumed his energy. As expected ... In this day and age, it was better to do something superficial than do something practical, such as moving a large city. If it wasn't for the great wilderness, he wouldn't have even thought about this.In the end, the effect was simply better than expected!Li Hao smiled and didn't mind. It was a good thing. As long as he didn't completely rely on this power, he could use it if he had it and not use it if he didn't have it. In fact, it might have a miraculous effect!Soon, Li Hao continued to move. Best novel online free at ‚ìù0‚ì•‚ìî‚ìõ‚ìë‚ìò‚ìù One after another, cities rose into the air and flew across the eastern continent.The People's cheers had long gone hoarse.Gradually, the cheers died down. However, at this moment, everyone's eyes were shining.They would never forget the man who appeared in the sky!At this moment, countless people felt their blood boiling. They also had to work hard to cultivate. The new Dao sect had just risen, and everyone had the opportunity to open 360 apertures. To be able to do this, it simply subverted their understanding.At this moment, regardless of whether they had trusted Li Hao before, countless people began to crazily admire and worship Li Hao.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ At this moment, in the great wilderness.The great desolate King did not care about that. He quickly led the great desolate Army into the area Li Hao had abandoned and began to expand. The aura of chaos spread continuously.On the other side, the star Army's obstruction continued, but it was not as fierce as before.This time, the desolate beast was excited and couldn't be bothered with Li Hao moving the city.One city after another disappeared.Large cities gradually rose up in the East Sea. The earth element experts were also using their divine arts to expand the land, fill the sea, and connect with the major cities. It would take more than a day to fill the entire East Sea.One day, two days, three days ...There were more and more cities. In the sky, Li Hao was also carrying things day by day without feeling tired. Now, although the people of Heavenly Star were no longer staring at them all the time, they would be inexplicably shocked every time they looked up!The fire in his eyes increased by three times.Li Hao, on the other hand, was full of energy. He had thought that he would be very tired ... But as the people believed in him, the power of great DAOs kept pouring into his body. While everyone was cultivating madly, he didn't even cultivate. However, dozens of apertures in his body were opened.Li Hao was quickly opening his apertures, preparing to complete his second cycle of 360 apertures and activate the second level of the sword technique.Where was the logic in this?I've done so many things, but I've never been better than a Porter!Fighting the divine Kingdom, fighting the new martial arts, fighting the traitors, promoting education, spreading new DAOs, building, building martial arts schools ... In the end, it was not as good as moving the city. Sure enough, everyone was shallow these days.Li Hao cursed in his heart countless times!In fact, it was the same for new martial arts. The heaven-battling Army was also very fanatical about him because he had moved the ancient city once.Now, he had started to move the city again. As a result, the people of Heavenly Star were extremely fanatical about him.If I had known this earlier ... I wouldn't have done anything but move things every day.Of course, he was also happy and happy.Not bad!Perhaps, by the time he was done transporting them, he might be able to open half of the second level of the sword Dao divine power!How much cultivation time had he saved?One day was equivalent to a month of bitter cultivation.He opened more than ten apertures every day. Under normal circumstances, Li Hao's cultivation speed was extremely fast, but he only opened one every few days. But now, he opened a bunch every day!A complete sword Dao divine power required 3600 apertures.Li Hao even thought that if he worked as a Porter and opened more than 10 a day, he might become a top-tier expert with 3600 apertures in half a year.Of course, this was an extravagant hope. In fact, as Li Hao moved more of them ... The effect began to decline, and they were no longer as fanatical as they were in the beginning.

2105 Chapter 355
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶As Li Hao continued to move the city, one city after another disappeared.The primal energy of the great wilderness had also started to spread and was slowly approaching Dingbian province.At this moment, the great desolate king's army gradually approached the Dingbian. A strange look appeared in his eyes.Li Hao didn't contact him again.He didn't contact Li Hao, either.However, he guessed that it might be here!If they continued, they would break through the eastern continent.Looking back, there were countless lakes ... This made the great desolation King feel very helpless. After seizing a large amount of territory, it was all black pits and lakes. The desolate beasts were very excited, but he was not.He had thought that Li Hao would give up some areas ... But it turned out that he really didn't leave any for him!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The ruins of Star Town.As the aura of the great desolation got closer and closer, the old turtle's clone said with a solemn expression,""Then I will have to trouble senior Yu this time! Li Hao gave up half of the continent in order to let the great wilderness Connect with the ruins of Star Town City. Those wild beasts only care about the eight main cities and not the other ruins, so they didn't care too much about this place ... Senior, if you can kill these wild beasts, the great wilderness will be destroyed, and the second recovery will be activated!"Yu Hai's eyes flickered and he nodded. "Don't worry! But ... Heaven battling city ... Are you really unable to teleport over? I might not be able to deal with so many Saint path beasts alone ..."Before the old turtle could say anything, the clone of "Wu Peng" suddenly said,""At the critical moment, heaven battling city will also appear!""Commander Wu!"Li Fuhai suddenly shouted. Wu Peng's face was calm,"We don't need to be on guard all the time when senior is taking a risk. As soldiers, it's better to speak frankly! Senior, our main priority is to guard against Hurricane city. As for the dire beasts, we still need to rely on senior and Li Hao to deal with them. However, if there's any danger, we'll teleport heaven battling city and come to join the battle!"Yu Hai's eyes flickered. He glanced at Wu Peng and smiled. "That's good. It's only right to be on guard. As a soldier, it's true that commander Wu is honest, but ... He can't say everything." "The heaven-battling Army has never feared anything!" Wu Peng's clone said calmly.Yu Hai smiled but did not say anything.The aura of chaos had already begun to spread over. Yu Hai looked into the distance and revealed a smile.People from Hurricane city ... Were here!The desolate beast had also come!And heaven battling city! Best novel online free at ‚ìù0‚ì•‚ìî‚ìõ‚ìë‚ìò‚ìù If everything went smoothly, perhaps this time, they would be able to take down the great wilderness in one fell swoop, recover a second time, seize heaven battling city, and defeat the Saints. With the recovery of the world, the seal would not be broken. This was simply a blessing from the heavens!The other main cities were nothing to be afraid of. Soon, they could be destroyed, open the boundary point, take away the things left in the boundary point, deal with the red moon sovereign, and take down the land of Silver Moon!A hundred thousand years of waiting ... Success seemed to be right in front of him!A hint of a smile appeared in Yu Hai's eyes again.And all of this was thanks to Li Hao.He didn't expect that Li Hao would allow the great wilderness to spread so easily and connect with Star Town City. He even wondered if the will of heaven was in a hurry to revive, so it interfered with Li Hao and made him choose to do so.This was because a second recovery was a good thing for the Heaven's Will.Perhaps, this was the reality."Soon ... I can already sense the presence of chaos!" Yu Hai suddenly laughed."It's been a long time since I've fought. Fellow Daoists, your clones can wait behind me later ... It's my duty to kill desolate beasts!"He couldn't wait!

2106 Chapter 356
The great wilderness.Chaos spread.Suddenly, a desolate beast appeared. It looked into the distance with some doubt and said,""There's a special fluctuation ahead. It might be the neo martial relic. Should we avoid it or just cover it?"In fact, neo martial relics were not rare.As long as it was not the eight major cities, the dire beasts did not care.Even if they were in the eight major cities and not the one where Hong Chen was, the dire beasts might not be afraid of them.But now, with Li Hao's relocation, the wasteland's invasion speed was very fast.Although heavenstar's side was still trying to stop them, they were not as strong as before. The area where the divine Dao desolate beasts could move was now larger."Look!"Just then, someone shouted.In the distance, hundreds of thousands of soldiers appeared from all directions. All the military governors had arrived.The light sword, jade light sword, Qin Lian, and Northern fist each led 100000 soldiers, making a total of 400000 military governors. They were densely packed as they gathered from all directions.Silver Moon experts appeared one after another.Sky sword, blade Overlord, Qian Wuliang, director Zhao ...These people appeared one after another.The desolate beasts were somewhat puzzled. The Heavenly Star's obstruction wasn't too strong earlier, and the great desolation had pushed through all the way. Was Li Hao not going to retreat again today?Some desolate beasts looked at the great desolate King.However, the great desolate King did not say a word. He only looked at the few black-armored experts. Towards the desolate beasts ... He actually looked down on them in terms of intelligence. However, at this moment, there were some experts from Hurricane city following beside the desolate beasts.These people were actually very smart.In fact, even the Grand desolate King could see that Li Hao was going to turn this place into a battlefield. The people of the mortal world must have seen it as well. Only the desolate beasts were focused on expanding. In fact, they still felt that Li Hao was really no match for them and thought that they could dominate the world."Li Hao has been moving all this time," the great barren King said in a deep voice."He's just stalling for time. At this moment, he should have gathered his Army and experts. Heaven battling city or other ancient cities might be nearby and may appear at any time to assist in the battle! Li Hao wants to have a life-and-death battle with us!"There were many sacred level wild beasts. At that moment, the Black Horse spoke again,""I sensed the aura of a neo martial relic just now. Could it be ... That there are experts hidden inside? are they the Trump cards that Li Hao prepared for us?"This time, everyone also came back to their senses.It was obvious that the ruins were unusual.The monkey bared his teeth and said,"Li Hao, aren't you afraid that we'll go around this place?" We won't give the other side a chance to border?"The aura of chaos could still be bypassed.The great desolation King said softly,"it's possible ... But it's definitely the core of the eastern continent. If we miss this place, it'll be an empty spot for the entire great desolation. This location is very important ... Li Hao is certain that we won't go around it. Venerables ... Are you willing to go around it?"Of course not! Dingbian was not only a prosperous place, but also an important location. It was the core of the entire Eastern continent. If they went around this place, it would be troublesome.However, they had also guessed that Li Hao's helpers might be in the remains.

A black-armored man said softly,""Li Hao has the ability to teleport experts. He might have been preparing all this time. There might be many experts hidden in this relic. This is the only large-scale relic between the great wilderness and the East, suitable for the opponent to use their full strength. So, it's normal for Li Hao to choose this place for the final battle."It was normal, but the few of them recalled some of the instructions that master Hong Chen had given them.Don't act rashly!This was Star Town ... The ruins of Star Town might be a little special. Although it wasn't the real star Town, red dust had reminded him many times to be careful before he came. More importantly, he felt that Li Hao might be up to something and had bad intentions.He had to see the situation clearly before making a decision.This time, three saints came out of the city, and Da Huang was not willing to accept any more.On the great wilderness 'side, there were a total of 6 Saint path desolate beasts.Nine Saint-level Masters!Even if a Heavenly King came, he could be killed by you!With such strength, they were not too afraid of each other. What they were afraid of was ... Da Huang was afraid of Hong Chen's side betraying them, and Hong Chen's side was afraid that Da Huang would attack them. Both sides were afraid of each other, which was what they were worried about.In the Silver Moon world, there were no venerable sovereigns other than the red moon.Nine saints could live well no matter where they went.She was not that worried or scared when she met a Heavenly King.At this moment, the barren King said,"seniors, if there's really a crisis, I hope that you can work together and put down some barriers. I know Li Hao very well. Although he has only recently risen to power, he can defeat the Three Kingdoms. We can't underestimate him!" "It's best if we can avoid the ruins in front of us ... We can surround the entire Eastern continent first and keep this place in the center ..."He said solemnly."You can 't!"Just as he said this, Ma Zun said angrily: ""The terrain here is special, and it's located in the core area. Unless we're separated far away, it's easy for the other party to kill us in an instant and attack us from behind. You're a King after all, but you're so brainless!""Venerable, let's avoid the sharp edge first ..." The great desolate King's expression changed slightly."Shut up!"Ma Zun berated!Avoid the blade?

2107 Chapter 356
The great desolate Queen was becoming more and more timid.If it wasn't for the fact that the other party had been in charge of the great wilderness for many years, and that the great wilderness had spread very quickly under his leadership these few days, it wouldn't even have bothered with him.If the ruins were left in the core region and they did not care about it, they might as well take advantage of the fact that the Saints of the mortal world were here and think of a way to resolve the crisis. What did the great desolate King know?When the great wilderness had swallowed the entire East, it would slow down its spread.At that time, they would also expel the few Saints from the mortal world, or even turn hostile.At that time, going back to solve the trouble in the star Town ruins ... Wouldn't he be making himself suffer? Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ To solve it ... Actually, the desolate beasts could not wait to solve it now!The great desolate King wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, he still said,""Then I will follow the orders of the venerable ones! However, we still have to be careful of Li Hao. He's full of tricks. The destruction of the Three Kingdoms and the death of the God nation's God all mean that he has the power to kill Saints ...""Shut up!"This time, the other sovereigns also chided him.This person was very annoying!Before the Great War, Li Hao had poured cold water on them time and time again. To the dire beasts, Li Hao was nothing to be afraid of. Only the guys from the neo martial artists were a little difficult to deal with. Back then, when the origin era was still around, the dire beasts were definitely no match for the neo martial artists.But now, it was different!The origin had been destroyed!Or rather, it had disappeared.As for the desolate beasts, although they were weaker than before, mainly because of the insufficient chaotic aura and had been suppressed, they were all at the Saint level, so they were definitely stronger than those Saints.Desolate beasts would not be afraid of these guys.Beside him, a black-armored man said softly,""There are several Saints in heaven battling city: general Huai, Guardian turtle, and commander of the reserve forces, Wu Peng. Even if all of them came ... It shouldn't be all of them, because if all of them came, heaven battling city would be out of control, and two would be the limit! In the other major cities, Li Hao might not be able to persuade the Saints to come, which means that the other party might have two saints hidden ... In addition to Li Hao's own power of the divine path, that's three ...""However, the other side has many suns and moons," he said."They're not weak. If they work together ... Even if they can hold back one Saint, that's four ..."The four Saints should be enough, right?The great desolate King once again sang the opposite tune,"not necessarily!" Li Haoming knows that we have many saints, but of course, he didn't attack us directly. Instead, he chose to wait and defend. He should be slightly weaker than us, but I don't think he's much weaker. Perhaps ... The other side has more Saints, possibly more than six!"The Man in Black armor glanced at him and nodded slightly.""Your analysis makes sense, but ... Where is he going to find more than six saints? We understand the current situation better than you. Of the eight main cities, Wuji has already been destroyed, sword city is sealed, Hurricane is in our hands, and only the Zhou clan's Xinghe city, the Zhao clan's martial Union City, the Zhang clan's heaven stabilizing city, the Hong clan's thunderstorm city, and the Wang clan's heaven battling city are left. Other than his close relationship with heaven battling city, it's very difficult for the other main cities to rope in Saints to help him in battle ...""Where's Zhang an?""Don't forget this person!"The great desolate King frowned. Black armor was stunned for a moment before nodding.""Maybe! However, Zhang an and Li Hao aren't that close ... Of course, they might come. Even so, there are only four or five of them ...""We still have to be careful," the great desolate King said in a deep voice again."I think the other party has prepared at least six or more saintly way powerhouses.""Don't worry!"Black armor was getting impatient."Not that much. We know the situation better than you do!"There were a few main cities that would definitely not send anyone.They understood this all too well.Even if they did come ... Hehe, Li Hao would have to be careful.The reason why they were so confident was naturally because they knew the inside story. Unless Li Hao had moved all the other ancient cities here.Otherwise ... It would be a fool's dream to deal with the 9 sages!From the start, they were not too worried. What they were more worried about was whether they could finish off the desolate beasts.They hoped that a few more Saints would appear on Li Hao's side. Even if they failed, killing two or three desolate beasts would do. Only then would they have a chance to directly break into the great wilderness and destroy both sides!The great desolate King tried to persuade him a few times, but at this moment, Ma Zun was starting to get impatient,""Alright, great desolate Queen, go to the front line and command the Army to deal with those little bugs! Kill less, these are all elites. After the chaos invaded, they were also the best Warriors of the vast wilderness!""Ah Luo can command, I ..."The great desolate King still wanted to say something, but Ma Zun said with a cold tone,""Are you going to disobey my order? Your daughter won't be able to deal with them, so you'll go to the front line to command!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe great desolate King was somewhat helpless. She sighed softly and nodded."Those great seniors ... Be careful and take care of yourself. With the great desolate Army around, those guys won't be able to cause any trouble!"With that, he sighed and rode on a wild beast, shouting,""Great desolate Army, listen to my command. In this battle, this King will lead the soldiers and break through the defense line in heavenstar in one fell swoop, seizing heavenstar!""Wansheng, my King!"BOOM!The million strong Army all cheered.Previously, when the great desolation King was imprisoned, they were very worried. Now, the great desolation King had personally appeared and led them on an expedition. In ten days, they had conquered half of the eastern continent. The million-strong Army was extremely excited.The great desolate King's voice rang out once again, and it was even more passionate and high-pitched."If we win this battle and annihilate the powerful enemy, the road ahead will be clear. Soldiers, if necessary, my great desolate Army will burn our blood and Qi, erupt our Primal Chaos, and fight to the death with the enemy! The other party has many experts, but the sovereigns are killing strong enemies ... They'll definitely come to help. A mere heavenstar can be destroyed with a wave of their hands!"

2108 Chapter 356
"Wan Sheng!"The wild shouts rose again.Behind him, a few sovereigns and a few Saints from the red dust World nodded slightly.An army of one million was not as strong as the enemy's army of four hundred thousand.Once the Heavenly Star Army formed a formation, it would actually be a problem. Many ants could kill an elephant. Moreover, the heaven battling Army was among them, and they had means to deal with the strong. It would be best if the great desolate Army could hold them back.So as not to interfere with the battle between the Saints!As for the countless deaths, the burning of blood and Qi, and the eruption of chaos ... It was fine if some people died. Once the invasion was successful, would there be a lack of people?He was still a little dissatisfied with the great desolate King earlier, but at this moment, Ma Zun chuckled,""As a King tier, he's a little timid. However, in a situation where there's no other way out, this fellow still dares to fight!"Previously, the great desolate Army had been lifeless, but now, they were full of excitement. The sovereigns were in a good mood.This way, some of the enemy's powerhouses would be held back."With him around, we can avoid some trouble ... But ...",m At the side, a wild beast that looked like a leopard said coldly,""It's just that this guy has been going against us time and time again! When things have stabilized, I'll just abdicate!"Even though the great desolate King had done a good job, this fellow had too many of his own thoughts.For example, just now, although he had warned them out of good intentions, to the desolate beasts, such a weakling who repeatedly strengthened Li Hao's side and kept alarmist talk was actually very annoying!"Yes."The Saints nodded at the same time. They would talk about it after the battle.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the front line, the great desolate King turned back to take a look, his face expressionless.From the beginning to the end, all his words were sincere.Since Li Hao's side dared to fight here, everyone knew that they must have made preparations and were not confident in dealing with more than six saints. Why would they fight here?Was there really no other way?Therefore, it was a problem if he didn't say anything.But ... Obviously, none of them listened to him. They all thought that Li Hao couldn't find so many saints and couldn't do anything to them. The final battle was just a last-ditch struggle.In the next moment, the great desolate King did not say anything else. With a stern shout that shook the heavens and earth, she shouted,""Blood essence explosion, Chaos invasion, great wilderness ... Victory!"BOOM!His vitality burst out, covering the sky and the sun.The chaos spread, and the world changed colors.He did not follow Li Hao's instructions to unleash his power at the critical moment. Instead, he unleashed his power directly to hide the truth. Whether Li Hao could grasp it or not was Li Hao's problem!As a King, it was best to adapt to the situation.Li Hao made it sound simple, but it wasn't that simple. At that time, it would be difficult to command the Army. Had Li Hao ever commanded an Army before?At this moment, the great desolate King's heart was filled with a sense of superiority.Li Hao ... Had no experience in commanding an Army. Did he really think that a million people were like one person?He could explode whenever he wanted?No preparation in advance?As expected, even after the great desolate King roared a few times, it still took a while for the great desolate Army to complete their vitality outburst. The aura of chaos spread. If it was really as Li Hao had said, it might not have been able to make it in time.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao saw this scene and nodded slightly.He knew that he was wrong.When there were many people, there would be all sorts of strange things. This was normal.On the other hand, the great desolate Queen actually managed to quickly seize the right to command the Army. She still had some ability.  n0vel 0nline free at‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Li Hao sent a message."All soldiers, unleash the power of your great DAOs. The power of your new DAOs will spread to the world. Let's fight!""Yes!"The next moment, roars shook the sky. The 400000-strong Army quickly completed their orders under the command of their respective generals. The aura of the great Dao spread, the sky changed color, and the will of heaven stirred!In this battle, the Heaven's Will had also interfered.The great wilderness had been invading non-stop, and the Heaven's Will had some intelligence. It knew that its territory was being invaded, and in these few days, it had been defending against the great wilderness 'invasion.At this moment, the Heaven's Will, the power of the new Dao, the power of Primal Chaos, and the power of blood Qi were all unleashed by millions of people, causing the entire heaven and earth to turn dark."Kill!"Accompanied by shouts, the two sides quickly collided on the dividing line. BOOM!A loud sound instantly resounded through the world.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The chaos began to spread.In the small tree in star suppression city, a figure gradually became visible.Yu Hai's figure gradually appeared. He raised his head to look at the sky and revealed a smile. 'I can finally ... Come out!'After looking around for a while, he saw that the clones of the experts were still there. He was a little dissatisfied, but he didn't show it. He said softly,"Fellow Daoists, when ... Will your true bodies descend? I'm worried that these guys won't be easy to deal with ..."Then, he looked at Wu Peng."Senior, there's no need to worry. Heaven battling city has already been activated and is approaching this place, but we have to take precautions against some unexpected situations, so we need some time,""Wu Peng" said in a deep voice."Heaven battling city ... Has been activated?""Right!""Senior will be able to sense it very soon ..." Wu Peng nodded.After saying that, he looked at the old turtle."Guardian turtle, senior is not from the main city. He may not be able to sense the arrival of the main city. Give senior a token. When the main city approaches, senior will be able to sense it in time. He can also cooperate with us to kill those desolate beasts ..."The old turtle was stunned and hesitated."This ... Senior is not from the main city. Commander Wu, this is not appropriate!" Once you give me the token, you can locate heaven battling city ..."

Wu Peng frowned,'at this point, working together is the most important thing! The sea Protector is not from the main city, so why can't I give it to senior if I can?""I ..."The old turtle was a little hesitant. Yu Hai said,""It's fine ...""It's not that we're petty," the old turtle said."It's just ... Forget it!"After saying that, he took out a small tortoise shell and handed it to Yu Hai.""Senior Yu, as long as heaven battling city appears nearby, senior will soon be able to sense its fluctuations ..."Yu Hai nodded slightly and revealed a smile.He was very clear about the situation in the main city.This thing could indeed locate the location of the main city, provided that the main city was close to it.Moreover ... The movement of the main city would cause a huge commotion. He was a top-notch expert. In fact, even if he did not give it to them, he would still be able to sense it. However, if he gave it to them, it would be even better. He would be able to control everything in time.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Boundless city.At this moment, there were also people in the city.Director Wang, Lin Hongyu, and the others didn't participate in the battle outside. Instead, they were extremely nervous, waiting for orders at any time. Their mission was simple. The moment heaven battling city descended, or the moment Li Hao opened the bright star field, they would activate boundless city and approach Dingbian province.On one hand, it was to deter Hurricane city, and on the other hand, it was to confuse the sea.He had to grasp the timing perfectly.The auras of heaven battling city and boundless city merged.For this battle, Li Hao's side had made all kinds of preparations. In the past ten days, they had not only moved the city, but also perfected their incomplete plans so that the enemy's suspicion would be minimized.The tacticians like director Zhao and Qian Wuliang were all involved in the planning. At this point, it was all down to luck.And in the Silvermoon world, there was a benefit to dealing with the great wilderness ... The will of the heavens was on his side.Heaven's will would interfere with some heavenly secrets.  n0vel 0nline free at‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The timing, location, and people were all on Li Hao's side.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao took a deep breath.Wearing the armor, Qian Wuliang instantly rushed out with the Army. In the sky far away, Qian Wuliang, who was wearing golden armor and had a giant dragon circling around him, shouted in the same voice as Li Hao,""Attack, kill the enemy, and destroy the great wilderness!""Kill!"BOOM!The Army quickly entered the battlefield. Hong long long, the sound of armor clashing and the neighing of mounts shook the world! At the same time, an aura exploded from the rear of the Army.On the side of the great wilderness, a few Saints looked at each other and nodded. They had sensed it.As expected, the other party's experts were all in the ruins. At the same time, a huge turtle appeared between the sky and the earth. Through the Army of both sides, they could vaguely see that it was a huge turtle that covered the sky. Upon seeing this, black armor said,""The turtle Guardian of heaven battling city."In the next moment, an extremely huge tree extended into the sky, its shadows flickering. Without him saying anything, everyone knew that it was general Huai.Their auras were not very clear, because there were too many troops and too much interference.But at least he knew that the other party had indeed sent a Saint.The few desolate beasts looked at each other and then at the few black-armored ones.""How ... Are you guys?"One of the black-armored men said softly,"venerable ones, you can attack first ... It's best if you can solve it yourself. If not ... We'll join the battle!" "We've only appeared with our true bodies this time. If we can't exterminate them completely, our identities will be exposed, and it will be a hindrance to our future actions ..."A few desolate beasts cursed in their hearts!To put it bluntly, they were just sitting on the mountain and watching the Tigers fight.Ma Zun was too lazy to say anything more, saying in a deep voice: ""Just help us a little ... Once the other party escapes, help to stop them. At the critical moment ... Help us destroy their great Dao of origin. We are all desolate beasts and have a chaotic system. We do not know much about the great Dao of origin ...""Of course!""Senior leopard, you go with a few fellow Daoists. The others ... They haven't fought for many years. Let's see the power of a neo martial artist!""Alright!"In an instant, five huge desolate beasts covered the sky and pierced through the void. They crossed the armies of both sides and headed straight for each other.At the back, senior leopard was a little dissatisfied and glanced at the sages.These guys not only didn't help, they even caused trouble.Of course, it soon felt that it was nothing.Because at this moment, golden-armored Li Hao flew over from the distance and headed straight for them. His voice resounded through the world."You guys, don't let me find out your identities. At this moment, the sky screen is facing you, and your auras are exposed. I'll send a message to the other ancient cities. I also want to see if anyone can recognize you!"The three saints, who were hidden under their black armor, looked solemn. They looked around and didn't say anything. They just slowly moved toward Li Hao.The sky screen?Message?I'll just kill you and everything will be over!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the other side, Qian Wuliang, who was in the Golden armor, looked pale and was covered in cold sweat.Be careful, be careful!Impersonating Li Hao and involving a few Saints were Li Hao's orders. The missions he had taken on recently were all the most dangerous. He knew that Li Hao valued him. Of course, he would have to seek revenge.This Marquis was not a big-hearted person.The incident from last time would probably come to an end after this. He would not take revenge on Zhao Shuguang anymore. Of course, it also had to do with his own abilities. Zhao Shuguang was not even worthy of competing with him for this mission.Victory or defeat would be determined by today's battle.A total of 9 Saints!
