Li Hao was not in a hurry. He did not kill long Zhan, but merely stopped him for a moment.Splitting open the sky was only the beginning.The stars of time began to crack. An extremely thick great Dao floated above Li Hao's head. It was the chaos great Dao. At this moment, the Queen seemed to be in the great Dao again.At the end of the path, there seemed to be countless eyes peeking at them.Li Hao paused for a moment and looked at the sky. Suddenly, he used his body as a sword and merged into the great Dao of chaos. As the body and sword cut, the great Dao of chaos seemed to tremble and roar!He was cutting the chaos Dao!Long Zhan suddenly roared, and the chaos great Dao trembled violently, trying to shake Li Hao away. He had the spirit of chaos and had a certain level of control over the chaos great Dao. Although his control was not much, he could still counter Li Hao's cutting.Li Hao turned his head to look at long Zhan, feeling somewhat helpless. This guy ... Is really annoying.He was blocked again and again!He had to stop them for a while."Five elements, gather!"With a low shout, the scattered power of the five elements seemed to gather again. At this moment, a shadow appeared. It looked like Li Hao, but also ... Yuan Shuo!The illusionary figure appeared, gathered the five elements, and punched out.It went straight for long Zhan!This wasn't enough. Li Hao cut his body again. At that moment, his five internal organs appeared. Among the five internal organs, there were five blood-colored figures the size of a fist. They carried the blood Qi in Li Hao's body and instantly appeared.He merged into the shadow!The illusionary image instantly became powerful, heading straight for long Zhan.……Deep in the chaos.The experts were all observing. At that moment, the five elements path master suddenly said,""What a ruthless man. He channeled his inner reserves, fused his essence, Qi, spirit, and blood, and used the five elements to fuse his five internal organs. Although he could barely resist long Zhan, as time goes on, his five internal organs will collapse and his five elements will shatter. Even if he successfully split open the sky, I'm afraid ... He might not be able to strengthen himself. He might even lose his own strength."At this moment, they were a little confused about Li Hao's decision. Splitting open the sky is to strengthen yourself, not to weaken yourself. If you continue like this, even if you succeed in splitting open the sky, how much stronger can you be?Perhaps, it would only be weaker."His master's spirit has merged into the four directions and controlled the five elements for him. He is not weak, but ... There is still a thirty percent chance of dealing with long Zhan. To deal with huntian ... It is as difficult as ascending to heaven. This time, I am afraid he will fail."Some people were not optimistic about Li Hao's chances.Although human King and spring and autumn were strong, they were not as strong as chaos heaven. Long Zhan had also delayed Li Hao's progress. It was already extremely troublesome for Li Hao to create a Foundation. To truly create a world was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!……Li Hao's face was pale.He didn't care. He entered the chaos great Dao. Behind him, long Zhan was still entangled with the shadow, but the shadow was no match for him. In the blink of an eye, it was beaten back by long Zhan. Obviously, the powerful long Zhan was stronger than the shadow.Long Zhan let out a Dragon's Roar, shaking the surroundings. Within the illusionary figure, blood flowed. Countless blood was shattered and scattered between the heaven and earth.Li Hao still didn't look back. He transformed into a sword and hacked at the chaos great Dao.He even wanted to obtain a portion of the origin of chaos. Unfortunately, the origin of chaos was even deeper, beyond the ninth-rank, so there was no hope of obtaining it.Unless they charged into the depths of the primordial chaos and started a war with the tier 9 experts.He was cutting the chaos great Dao, but he didn't care about those tier 9 ones.However, once they charged in ... They would probably be torn apart very quickly."What a pity ..."Li Hao mumbled. It was a pity that he could not get it. If he had the origin of chaos, it would be stronger and more convenient.He had no choice!He couldn't wait any longer. If he did, it would be more troublesome.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, Li Hao exhaled, and the stars of time appeared again. The stars of time that he had transformed into worlds before seemed to have been reunited.However, at this moment, the time star seemed to have lost some of its luster.Some people were surprised!Where did the second time star come from?Very quickly, someone seemed to have recognized him. In the depths of chaos, the master of tianfang took a look and shook his head. "It's fake. It only has the shape, but not the spirit. Li Hao reassembled it with special means. It's not the real time!"From this, it could be seen that even if one truly mastered 10000 DAOs, they might not be able to transform them into time!This star was, in fact, a copy of the great Dao by two cats. Later, Li Hao reassembled it and formed a time star. In reality, it only had a shape and did not have any time power.……Just as Tian Fang was explaining the origin of this star ...Li Hao naturally knew that time was unique. If the previous star was still there, the new one would not possess the power of time. He did not need the star to reverse time.The moment the fake star appeared, Li Hao's flesh and blood were torn apart. Drops of blood, along with the great Dao, spread into the Star.In an instant, the power of countless great DAOs surged into it.Countless chaotic force surged into it. The Dao meridians in Li Hao's body, which had long turned into stars, suddenly reappeared like stars and merged with the fake stars.At this moment, Li Hao had cut off some of the chaos great DAOs and instantly placed them in.The entire star seemed to have come alive.At that moment, the level 9s seemed to know what Li Hao was going to do. He wanted to create ... A simulated origin of chaos.At this moment, a powerful existence among the grade 9 existences suddenly laughed,""He wants to create an origin of life, gathering it with tens of thousands of DAOs and nurturing it with flesh and blood. However, he is wrong. The origin of life can not be created so easily. We can all create worlds and Dao domains, but we can not create a world that can truly give birth to living beings ..."

3711 Chapter 600
This was because the source of life came from the source of chaos at the end of the chaos great Dao.This was something that could not be created!Li Hao wanted to use a fake time star to gather thousands of DAOs and nourish them with his flesh and blood to turn them into a source of life. It could only be said that he was too naive. The source of life created in this way ... Might be useful for the time being, but it would be useless very soon. At this moment, the other powerhouses seemed to have figured it out as well.In the distance, the human king who was sent flying by huntian's punch couldn't help but curse,"“艹! You're not even prepared, and you're randomly splitting open the sky? Could this thing be the source of life? Don't mess around, just open up a space and comprehend the ten thousand DAOs ..."Did he really want to create a chaos that could give birth to living beings?Would it work?It was obviously not reliable!They had thought that Li Hao could simply open a space and experience the birth of thousands of DAOs. But Li Hao was obviously more ambitious. He wanted to open a real chaos and create a source of life!To be able to give birth to living beings in the world ... Wasn't this nonsense?Li Hao still ignored him.In this world, even the great Dao could give birth to living creatures and the spirit of the great Dao, so why couldn't the origin of chaos appear?The existence of life was in the spirit.It was wisdom!When the great Dao of stars gained intelligence and spirituality, it could naturally become the source of life. Of course, it was very difficult.Taking advantage of long Zhan still being entangled, he took a look at the star in front of him.Just as the others had thought, although there was a faint spiritual light, it was almost impossible to turn it into a source of life.Li Hao took a deep breath.At this moment, a hand suddenly stabbed into his chest, and a bloody heart was slowly dug out. The heart was still beating. Li Hao said softly,""It's good that he's an unintentional person. At my level, my heart ... Must contain a large amount of life and spirituality. If I fuse it with my heart, I might be able to temporarily replace the source of life, right?“……”The few people who were engaged in a fierce battle could not help but look over.Long Zhan also forced the shadow back with one strike. He looked at Li Hao, his huge eyes flashing with solemness. Li Hao had gone completely crazy.At their level, they could even be reborn from a drop of blood.However, the heart was still the key to maintaining one's life.Once it was broken, it would be a serious injury.Moreover, the heart contained a large amount of life essence. At this moment, Li Hao took it out himself and began to fuse it with the pseudo-star of time. The star seemed to be beating. At this moment, long Zhan even felt that ... He didn't even need to stop Li Hao. Li Hao could play himself to death!This madman might really play himself to death here.However, even if it was merged into the heart, it was still not enough. Perhaps it could be maintained for a while, but if this continued, even if some life was really born, it would probably be exhausted soon.The life force here was still limited. Li Hao was very strong, but he was only a level-eight cultivator.It was not enough to maintain the operation of the entire world.In this way, after a batch of first-generation creatures were born, perhaps soon ... The world would dry up again.That would be meaningless!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, something seemed to be brewing in the fake star. Li Hao seemed to have seen something and laughed. In an instant, the real time star suddenly gathered, and a wave of time power spread out!The entire pseudo-star started to grow rapidly!"Dong Dong Dong ..."It was as if his heart was beating, becoming stronger and stronger, but ... It was beginning to dry up quickly, and the sound of his heartbeat seemed to be weakening.Long Zhan once again sent the apparitions that surrounded him flying. He went straight for Li Hao and sighed,""Why bother? It was impossible to succeed! If the origin of life could be created as well, why would the chaos race need to do so? We can just create another source of life, why would we need to make the world our enemy?"Li Hao was possessed!In order to create the world, he had completely fallen into bedevilment.In all of the primordial chaos, the most difficult Dao to decipher was not time itself, but ... The source of life!You, a rank eight, want to create a source of life out of thin air. If it was so simple, everyone could create one and be the master of their own chaos. Why would they be entangled with each other in this chaos?"You don't understand!"Li Hao, however, shook his head."Life is evolved, not born out of thin air. There's no creator. As long as the source of life can give birth to extremely weak life, it will evolve into all living things sooner or later!""Build a life and death recovery system ... Grow stronger bit by bit, absorbing the power of Chaos from the outside, from weak to strong, and strengthen your own life. After death, return to the source of life, and the source of life will be able to grow on its own ... Understand?"He laughed."This is also a Dao. The great Dao is weak to begin with. As long as you continue to strengthen it, the great Dao will eventually be powerful to the extreme! What's more, I'm only creating pseudo-chaos. As long as I continuously absorb chaotic force and convert it into life force ... Experts will be born, experts will die, and the origin of life will return ... Life and death will be repeated ... That's enough!"The difficulty of the origin of life was not in strengthening it, but rather ... It could not be extinguished!The key was to maintain its spirituality and vitality.This required solidification!As time passed, it would not be extinguished. As long as it could do that, it would naturally evolve. But now ... It was not enough. As the power of time covered it, it was being extinguished, aged, aged ....

3712 Chapter 600
If this continued, it meant that the entire source of life would dissipate as time passed.He was still missing something.As Li Hao thought, he turned his head to look at long Zhan, his eyes somewhat red.""Perhaps, it's still lacking something. Long Zhan, tell me, after killing you and stripping away your spirituality, can it maintain life without extinguishing?"The Dragon War was related to the spirit of chaos.Perhaps killing him would do.At this moment, Li Hao thought to himself. Suddenly, he no longer merged with the chaos great Dao. Instead, in an instant, he walked toward long Zhan. 'Since you're not leaving, I'll kill you. I'll try again!'Long Zhan smiled instead.Li Hao had been fusing with the chaos great Dao all this time, so he had been a little apprehensive. Now that Li Hao had come out, he found Li Hao easier to deal with.At this moment, the spirits of the five elements trembled.It was instantly dispersed, and its power returned to Li Hao.Li Hao's aura skyrocketed.In the distance, Spring Autumn and the other two were still engaged in a fierce battle. Human King and Spring Autumn had joined forces, but they were still being beaten by huntian. Human King was in the worst situation ... Li Hao had expected this. After all, human King was the weakest.At this moment, the human King had not integrated new martial arts, so he was naturally no match for the other party.However, Li Hao believed that the human King was an unkillable and resilient person. As long as his side was not defeated, he would not be easily killed by Spring Autumn. Although this person might not be very strong, he could hold on for a while no matter who he fought.His faith was so strong that it was terrifying!"Human King, hold on for a while. Once I successfully split open the sky and kill a few tier 9 experts, everything will be yours ..."With a boom, the human King fell back and spat out blood."Stop making empty promises!" He couldn't help but curse."When I'm making empty promises, your ancestors are all cells!"Who are you trying to fool?'When I was young, I fooled countless people. Later, there was no one worthy of being fooled anymore, so I retired from the martial arts world. You're just a kid, and you're still trying to make empty promises for me?'Come on, you!Li Hao smiled shyly. Right, he had forgotten.The human King was best at this."Then ... I'll write you an IOU. You can owe me first ..." He said."Shut up, you!"The human King's long blade shattered. With a roar, he suddenly transformed into a blade and shouted,""Eat my knife!"The saber Qi swept across the world!Huntian retreated slightly. A desperate human King wasn't someone to be trifled with. Although he wasn't afraid, he still had spring and autumn by his side. At this moment, spring and autumn also had tens of thousands of incarnations. Time withered and flourished, and ten thousand DAOs were destroyed.He wasn't even a match for him alone, but the human King's desperation and the interference of spring and autumn also made him feel uncomfortable.After all, he was not truly invincible!He let out a breath and suddenly waved his hand. The nine Heavens and earth shook. The entire West and thousands of worlds shook. The power of countless worlds seemed to sweep over at this moment!He controlled the West and was much more powerful than what outsiders thought.In an instant, the thousands of worlds seemed to wither as the power of countless worlds gathered. Huntian struck out with his palm, and the human King, who had just appeared, was once again slapped into the void!His body was being crushed and blood was flowing out. The human King grunted, but he laughed in the next moment,""Good, it's strong enough, I like it, it's good to beat me up! Huntian, again! If you can't kill me, you'll have to die!"This kind of pain in the ass, if he wasn't killed in one blow, he would never feel tired!The human King's vulgarities came out crazily."You little thing, you can't even see your crotch even if you scratch it. When you make a move, it's as small as your thing ... Are you giving me a massage?"“……”The human King's curses reverberated through the heavens and earth, shaking the surroundings.Huntian's expression was extremely ugly.He admitted that his tolerance was unrivaled, but the human King ... Was really too vulgar. He was a Grand Neo martial arts Overlord, the king of a region, but his cursing was more disgusting than those gangsters.……Li Hao couldn't help but laugh.The human King was really full of energy.Even after being beaten up like that, his mouth was still extremely tough. At this moment, long Zhan had completely broken away from the entanglement and appeared in front of Li Hao. The aura of the giant Golden Dragon erupted, shaking the world. He no longer tried to persuade Li Hao. Li Hao had already been possessed.His powerful physical body swept over without any fancy techniques. As the strongest expert of the chaos race, his physical body was his strongest!A powerful physical strength appeared and shattered all the force. Even Li Hao's time shield was shattered by it!What power of 10000 DAOs, what power to split open the heavens, in long Zhan's eyes, they were all the same, strong and easily broken.Li Hao's five elements, life and death, Nirvana, recovery, and desire ...The power of great DAOs kept appearing, but they were shattered again and again.Long Zhan continued to close in on Li Hao. The chaos beneath their feet was torn apart, and the nine Heavens and earth were completely penetrated.Li Hao took a few steps back and gasped for breath.He shook his head.Difficult to deal with!Long Zhan responded to all changes by remaining unchanged. He relied on his powerful and invincible body. No matter how you changed your spells, he would still use the same moves. This made it difficult for Li Hao, a cultivator who was skilled in all kinds of great DAOs, to deal with.Long Zhan also became smoother the more he fought, his voice spreading over once more,""Li Hao, you can't even defeat me, and you want to create a new world and create chaos? I'm afraid you're too arrogant! There's still time to stop now ..."  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Long Zhan, although you're a Chaos Beast, you're the most hesitant here. You don't have the aura of pressing forward with an indomitable will!"Li Hao sneered.Long Zhan did not speak.I know.'But I ... Am not them.'Behind me is my race, and you ... The human King can kill the new martial artist at any time, and you, Li Hao, can Force Master to death. The race of spring and autumn won't live for more than a spring and autumn, so she's not too afraid of anything.As for huntian, he was determined to unify the world, so he didn't care about the necessary sacrifices."Only our Primal Chaos race was born with difficulty. His ambition was not to dominate the world, but to ensure that the primal Chaos race could prosper for a long time.Li Hao continued to retreat and laughed."Long Zhan, if you were more open, you might have been even stronger. You wouldn't be standing on the same level as me and the human King now. At the very least, you would have the qualifications to fight against the spring and autumn era. Your hesitation is the reason why you can't win against them."In the distance, the human King coughed up blood,'d * MN, who are you talking about? I'm number one in the world. You mean ... I'm on the same level as you two?"“……”He felt that it was embarrassing to be on the same level as Li Hao.Li Hao smiled."I succeeded in splitting open the sky. That's not the case. Please don't be angry, human King!"“……”Go to hell!The human King no longer paid attention to him. These words didn't have any good intentions.At this moment, he was somewhat powerless to refute because huntian had become stronger. This fellow had become more and more courageous the more he fought in the Western Territory. He was about to be beaten to death!Although he was often beaten up, this time, he really didn't have any strength to fight back.It was very annoying! He glanced at Li Hao from the corner of his eye. Li Hao might be laughing freely, but in fact, this guy had played himself until he was a little weak. At this moment, when he was fighting long Zhan, he was also at a disadvantage. It was three against two, but it was difficult to win against these two.As for the reinforcements, old Zhang would be lucky if he didn't die from withdrawal.Even if there were reinforcements, they would be from huntian and the others, not their side.Once again, huntian's punch broke his bones. Human King couldn't help but shout,""If I still can't deal with long Zhan, I'll run away ... I'm about to be beaten to death!"At this point, huntian also heaved a sigh of relief.The human King was about to retreat.Even though this fellow was no match for him, he was truly too persistent. He had attacked madly time and time again. Even if his injuries were more serious and he could only leave behind some minor injuries, the human King was so excited that it was as if he had just killed him!If this continued, he would have a headache.At this moment, Li Hao was also retreating.His eyes, however, gradually began to light up.It should be about time!Long Zhan, you asked for all of this. The chaos race will not be exterminated. It's just that it's probably going to decline completely.

Chapter 3713 The Devil (1)
(I haven't finished yet. I'll watch it in a day or two. I don't want to be scolded.)Li Hao's eyes lit up.On the other hand, long Zhan, who had a strong physical body, was closing in step by step, trying to suppress Li Hao. Suddenly, he saw Li Hao's gaze, and his heart skipped a beat.Li Hao was the youngest among the Chiefs.Their strength wasn't the best. Before this, they were the weakest.However, the youngest and weakest cultivator had risen rapidly and defeated all the old men. Even a talented strong man like the neo martial King was gradually caught up by him and even began to surpass him ... Long Zhan did not dare to underestimate him.Subconsciously, he knew that something was wrong.What was the problem?Li Hao had used almost all of his trump cards.The previous few times, he had summoned ten thousand spirits, but this time, he didn't have the chance at all.Last time, he had reversed the past and the future to summon someone from the future, but that person didn't leave the river. Even if he summoned someone today ... Putting aside whether Li Hao had enough time, even if he really summoned someone from the future, he was someone who couldn't leave the river. He wasn't a lightning tribulation and was stuck in a certain place.In that case ... Li Hao's physical body was inferior to his, and his Dao was only on par with his. How could he deal with him? He had no choice!Moreover, Li Hao was extremely weak at the moment. What could he do to him?His divine runes, the thousands of divine runes, might have been his trump card, but he had used them to suppress the chaos great Dao ...It had to be said that Li Hao had a lot of tricks up his sleeve.But ... At this point, what else could he do?He had no other choice!These thoughts quickly flashed through long Zhan's mind. Yes, Li Hao shouldn't be able to do anything. As for crossing over and intercepting his past self, let's not talk about whether Li Hao could do it in front of him. Even if he could ... Li Hao hadn't killed his past self, and he would have killed Li Hao first.He's threatening me!A thought appeared in long Zhan's mind. Yes, he felt that Li Hao was definitely deliberately intimidating him.Was it a threat?At this moment, Li Hao smiled.Long Zhan's attacks were even stronger. Bloody marks appeared on Li Hao's body, and there were even penetrating wounds. The long river of the great path was also fluctuating at this moment, and many stars were shattered.However, Li Hao was even happier."Are you trying to scare me?"Long Zhan's eyes were frosty. Do you think that I will believe it?Li Hao, you can't scare me!The more you are like this, the more determined I am to kill you. I didn't want to deal with you so soon, but you forced me. You forced everyone in the world to be your enemy."Who has the time to scare you?"Li Hao mumbled and laughed.How could that be?Long Zhan was a Chaos Beast after all. It was good to cultivate the physical body, but he had cultivated too much. His brain was also a little abnormal.At this moment, stars reappeared in all directions.It was like a cage that enveloped the two of them.Although long Zhan didn't know what Li Hao was planning, he wouldn't just stand by and watch. His huge claws appeared and grabbed the sky and earth. In an instant, the stars in the sky were crushed!   Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Those powerful realms could deal with other venerable sovereigns, but when they encountered long Zhan, they were all shattered by him."I'll prevent your Dao domain from forming. No matter how much you think, you won't be able to do anything to me.The Dragon claws were extremely sharp and they tore the void apart. The starry realms began to shatter one after another.Li Hao didn't seem to care.The current long Zhan couldn't help but think, to exhaust me?Li Hao was overthinking.He mainly fought with his physical body, and his energy came from his physical body. In fact, he didn't consume much of the power of his great DAOs. In terms of consumption, cultivators like Li Hao, who mainly relied on the power of great DAOs, were definitely inferior to him.In terms of endurance, he was definitely better than Li Hao.Obviously, this wasn't to consume his energy. Was Li Hao just trying to be mysterious?The more he thought about it, the angrier he became.Don't even think about getting your way!The stars shattered one after another, and the power of the great DAOs overflowed, floating between heaven and earth. Huntian Supreme Emperor, who was fighting the human King, suddenly turned to look at Li Hao, and his expression changed slightly.In the next moment, he seemed to have thought of something, and his expression changed slightly.Li Hao ... Li Hao's power of stars was falling towards the West. He had split the Time and Stars into illusory worlds. However, he was not strong and did not have the help of the spirit of ten thousand emperors, so no one paid much attention to him.But at this moment ... Huntian seemed to have realized something.His expression suddenly changed!Not good.It was ... The heavenly policy of order!The heavenly order strategy was still with Li Hao.However, when the war broke out, the heavenly order policy seemed to have disappeared, so huntian did not pay much attention to it.Li Hao thought that it was a good thing that he had chosen the Western edge. But at this moment, a thought suddenly occurred to him. Was the Western edge ... Just because it was quiet?No, it wasn 't!It was because ... He had left the core of the West. The heavenly policy of order ... Its control over order might have surpassed his control over the West.Not good!At this moment, he saw long Zhan shattering the stars. He quickly shouted,""Don't break the stars anymore ... He's establishing order ..."Long Zhan was shocked in his heart!Order?What order ... Isn't order under your control?Li Hao was a time cultivator. How could he have any order ...Heavenly policy of order?However, the heavenly policy of order is only a part of the way of order. Even if you, huntian, can't control it, it'll be difficult for you to deal with me just by relying on the heavenly policy of order.The thought emerged, but he did not dare to neglect it.It no longer shattered those stars.Li Hao chuckled. The stars of the great path that spread in all directions suddenly shattered naturally. Li Hao said softly,""The great Dao remains the same. If it's not destroyed, how can it rise from destruction?"

Chapter 3714 The Devil (2)
At this moment, a book appeared. It was the heavenly policy of order.Within it, the power of order roiled, and countless broken stars seemed to be reborn, re-establishing rules.New rules!But long Zhan still didn't understand. Even if order was re-established on these stars, what could it do?He still did not understand ...However, huntian seemed to have understood. His expression changed again, and he did not even have the time to say anything. The moment the heavenly policy of order appeared, he suddenly roared and began to extract the fluctuating power of order in the surroundings!The West ... Damn it!At this moment, he finally understood why Li Hao had chosen to split open the sky in the West.He wants to ... Steal my results!How hateful!Damn it, I shouldn't have used the heavenly policy of order to invade Li Hao. Now, I might have to make a wedding dress for Li Hao.Li Hao, who had been resisting order all this time, was now smiling brightly. He no longer resisted the order heavenly policy. Instead, he completely integrated order into his body.The master of order ...This was what huntian asked him to do.At this moment, the power of the great Dao and the characters of the great Dao from the 5000 realms overflowed into the sky and earth. They filled the entire West and fell toward some realms.The power of order quickly gathered.Li Hao stepped into the ranks of order, and his entire person suddenly changed. He no longer smiled, but said coldly,""Thank you fellow Daoist huntian for your help. Order is a good thing!"He was merging with the order while spring and autumn was attacking huntian. Suddenly, he screamed,""What are you doing!"Li Hao had merged with order and become the master of order. Wasn't this exactly what huntian wanted?So, in the end, you still work for huntian?Even if you kill long Zhan, in the end, you become huntian's puppet. Then what's the point of going through all this trouble?As for Li Hao's choice, she was completely confused.So, your final trump card is to transform into the master of order?What a joke!Then, was she and the human King going to be lonely here?Chunqiu was furious!Even if you can't split open the sky, just admit defeat. This battle doesn't necessarily have to be decided."Calm down, order, not The Order of Chaos ... It's the order of the human race, what's the hurry ..."Li Hao's voice echoed."In the chaos, humans are the king and the ruler of all the creatures, aren't they?"Who said that order was chaos?Didn't huntian's clone get destroyed by you and me?Have you forgotten?Spring and autumn, this great demon was really forgetful.Order alone could not kill long Zhan. At this moment, countless divine runes of the great path fell into the Western world and arranged themselves in battle formations. It was as if the world of the great path had been revived. "Long Zhan, be careful ...""Kill!" Huntian suddenly roared.At this moment, his mood was a little complicated. Not good. Li Hao, this bastard, entering order was not too much trouble for him, but for long Zhan ... It was big trouble!Long Zhan still didn't quite understand, but he also knew that it was definitely no small matter. At this moment, he quickly attacked Li Hao.The dragon's tail swept across the void, and the power of order was swept away!The powerful force forced Li Hao to retreat.Li Hao, however, was in no hurry.He slowly retreated, but his voice grew louder,""I Control Order. Whoever destroys order will be punished by the heavens and destroyed by the earth!""In the Western world, humans are the Kings. Beasts of Chaos don't know the heavenly Dao and don't abide by order. Use order to establish rules and kill them!""Who Do You Think You Are?!" Long Zhan roared."You think ... You can make the Western world believe in you with just a few words?"What a joke! At this moment, huntian was a little sad ... He knew that he was in trouble.Not too good!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ That was because the West ... Had been brainwashed by him!That's right, the entire West was under a certain order of faith. The entire West had been brainwashed by him. He extracted the desires, worries, darkness, and ambitions of countless living beings in the West. At the same time, he had also planted a seed in the Western world.Order was the only thing.If he had successfully invaded Li Hao before, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to do anything since his will was still in the heavenly order scroll.Secondly, Li Hao had the power of faith of trillions of humans.Mixed with order, it naturally had a bewitching power to the human race.As for the Westerners, it could be said that they were the easiest to be bewitched. The premise was that they were controlled by order.This was a hidden danger that he, huntian, had planted.For the peace of the West, for the people of the West to maintain order, he used his faith to brainwash everyone, including the experts of heaven battering world.This was also one of the reasons why he was so determined to take back the heavenly order scroll.However, he didn't expect Li Hao to completely integrate into order. He couldn't help but roar,""Li Hao, you'll become a puppet of order if you merge with it. You should know that there's no loss to me. It's not worth it to kill long Zhan ..."He didn't know if he should be happy or worried.He was happy that Li Hao had integrated into order, so he had some hope of controlling him again.What he was worried about was ... Once it went out of control, long Zhan might really be finished, and he would be unable to continue controlling Li Hao. He would suffer a double loss.The long Zhan at this time also seemed to have understood something."Huntian, you ..."This bastard!At that moment, he could feel an extremely powerful power of faith erupting from the entire West. It was a spiritual will, a will to unify and protect order ...

Chapter 3715 The Devil (3)
These wills crazily nurtured Li Hao's scattered divine text.The divine text grew crazily, bringing with it boundless spiritual power.At this moment, Li Hao's aura soared.Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to have completely integrated into order and become The Guardian of order. An extremely strong will burst out, protecting order and the human race ...There were countless humans in the entire West.At this moment, all the cultivators and ordinary people felt the power of faith and Order in the air. They seemed to see a Savior fighting against a giant dragon.It was the dark Dragon that destroyed order!The darkness was destroyed!"Kill it!""Kill it!"“……”The voice seemed to come from the bottom of his heart and spread throughout the West.Some of the powerhouses who were engaged in a fierce battle with the Supreme-being and the others suddenly felt something. Even the powerful ninefold guards 'expressions changed slightly at this moment. Some of them looked behind them, and some of their eyes were filled with enthusiasm."It's ... Dao master ..."Dao master!This Dao master was not huntian.He was ... The true master of order!No matter how strong his addiction was, at this moment, after cutting off Cang Mao's fishing rod, he could not help but turn back to look. His gaze was a little complicated. It was the energy fluctuation of a Dao master ... No, it was the master of order.Someone was establishing true order, and huntian path master ... Actually, he had never truly integrated into order or the heavenly policy of order. Although he was using order, in huntian's eyes, order was only one of the ways to use it, not the only one.This was the case for all top powerhouses.For example, Li Hao had never truly integrated with the time star. He only used it as a means of his own, but it didn't mean that he was time.,m Huntian was the same.He had been using order but had not truly integrated it into his body. This meant that his future would be limited to the great Dao of order.This was not the choice of a top-tier powerhouse!Withdrawal, in fact, was very clear about this!However, he didn't feel that huntian's choice was inappropriate. As long as huntian still controlled order, it didn't matter even if he wasn't the master of order. After all, only huntian controlled the Dao of order.However, at that moment ... Withdrawal symptoms were starting to show signs of hesitation.Was it ... Li Hao?Had he integrated into the heavenly policy of order, transformed into order, and completely taken over the order of the West?This ... What was going on? Had huntian path master lost control of the heavenly policy of order?The entire West seemed to have been taken over by Li Hao's order.So many people were fighting. How did Li Hao manage to take over the order of the entire West in an instant?At this moment, the Supreme-being opposite him seemed to have sensed something. He coughed and laughed."This is interesting ... The time King isn't going to merge with time but with order! Then, who was the master of order now? Do the ninefold guards follow chaos heaven or order?"At this moment, the other ninefold guards were feeling uneasy and hesitant.Jiejie's expression changed slightly and he growled,""Don't be bewitched by them. We've always followed order! It's just that ... Li Hao might not be in control of the current order. Dao master, there's a way. Li Hao is just a destructer of order, a passerby!"The order in the West was being taken over by Li Hao.At this moment, they also understood why Li Hao had to split open the sky in the West. It was a good place. If he took over the order, he could instantly own the vast territory in the West!Huntian had been taken care of and arranged.The words of withdrawal did not make the ninth layer guards feel at ease.At this moment, the Grandmaster laughed faintly."You are all experts under the master of order. For order, you rule the nine Heavens!" Now that they had lost control of order, huntian was only the incarnation of darkness. Why? did the ninefold guards only follow darkness? And not ... Order!"The expressions of the ninth layer guards kept changing.What was this good?Could Dao master regain control of order?At this moment, a wave of fluctuations swept over from the entire West. It was the will of huntian. At this moment, huntian had also realized that something was wrong. Just as he had expected, he was trying to seize control of the order in the West!……On the Western edge.The power of order in Li Hao's body was boundless!"You're courting death!" Huntian Supreme Emperor roared as he fought the two of them. Dark energy surged and a powerful will swept out in all directions. The will of huntian, the will of unity, enveloped the entire area!If Li Hao continued, he would probably take over the entire Western world that was under the control of humans!At this time, long Zhan did not dare to be slow. He went all out and attacked Li Hao crazily. His dragon claws tore through the layers of order power in front of Li Hao as he roared continuously,""Li Hao, didn't you want to split open the sky? Didn't you want to control time? Don't you pursue freedom? Didn't you want to discuss the Dao with the heavens?""You're willing to become a puppet of order?"He wanted to curse!艹!If you completely integrate into the order, Won't You Be the second master of order?So, all those pursuits you said before were all bullsh * t?If you want to split open the sky, you're also splitting open loneliness?You want to become The Guardian of order, The Guardian of the human race. Is this your pursuit?He had not expected Li Hao to completely merge with order. Even if Li Hao had completely merged with time, he would have believed it. After all, Li Hao had been cultivating and controlling time.

3716 Chapter 601
The heavenly policy of order had just been seized.It was also mixed with a lot of power of faith that Li Hao was unwilling to accept.In the end, at this time, he absorbed it all!If you were willing to do this earlier, you could have just accepted your fate when huntian invaded you.At this moment, Li Hao was expressionless and only looked at him silently. Layers of barriers appeared in front of him, and countless power of faith and Order swept toward him. The West was a good place.It was impossible to gather so much power of order from other places.Moreover, it wasn't that simple.After all, the human heart was too complicated. However, this place ... Was much simpler. Huntian had laid a good foundation and even considerately eliminated all the complicated thoughts. The Westerners were the most simple.At this time, long Zhan broke through layer after layer of barriers, but there was still a steady stream of rule force that emerged.He was furious!"Huntian!"Bastard, don't you have any ideas?Are you going to let Li Hao take over your West?Is it your home field or Li Hao 's?If this continued, when Li Hao gathered enough power of order, perhaps ... He could really kill him.The current long Zhan was already rather anxious.If this continued, huntian would be powerless to stop him. He ... Would not wait for Li Hao to gather enough power of order and borrow the power of the West to kill him. He could only retreat.At this moment, huntian, who was facing the frenzied attacks of two great experts, was also rapidly summoning his will. He shouted,""Don't worry. I'll take back control. Li Hao, you're walking right into a trap!"A surge of dark energy spread out. The originally pure power of order was suddenly contaminated by the darkness and spread out, heading straight for the various worlds.I've only absorbed the darkness in their hearts!As long as darkness invades, these people won't believe in you just because of a few words. Li Hao, you're still too inexperienced. On the other hand, I can take the opportunity to completely control you.The darkness was absorbed by me, so I can naturally return it!Waves of dark will quickly returned to the source of the order power.They surged toward the countless human worlds.At this moment, the entire Western world was under the control of the two of them. Countless cultivators were like puppets in the hands of the two of them, controlled at will.As the power of darkness returned and invaded, the power of order that Li Hao had been gathering began to stagnate and shake.If the People's hearts were scattered, they would have their own thoughts and no longer believe in faith, which would make it difficult to lead them.Huntian heaved a sigh of relief. Long Zhan was the same.Luckily!It would be too disappointing if huntian had no way of retaliating.At this moment, Li Hao's face was slightly dark. He looked at huntian and shook his head."Huntian, it wasn't easy to create the Pure Land of the West. Are you going to return the West to its original state today?" The power of darkness once again spread out. This also meant that huntian had returned all the desire, ambition, and darkness that he had destroyed.The Pure Land of the West would no longer exist.Huntian was extremely cold."I'll kill you or control you. Then, I'll take you back. Everything will be the same!" What can a short loss of control do?"Don't even think about shaking me!The human King completely ignored their conversation. Taking advantage of the fact that a portion of the power of Chaos darkness had dissipated, he seemed to have seized the opportunity to brandish his large saber and attack his opponent!At this moment, the human King was completely silent.If he couldn't win, he would just blabber on and on. If he could fight, he would always kill first before talking.When he was extremely talkative, it meant that he was no match for the other party and wanted to interfere. When he seized the opportunity, he would not curse at the other party at all. Whether the human King was a match for the other party would be known from how much he talked.Li Hao was well aware of this.Chaos heaven had interfered with Li Hao's control of order, but it had also caused a slight decline in his strength. At this moment, the human King was not soft-hearted at all. Seizing opportunities was also the fighting style that human Kings were best at.Ten thousand DAOs appeared. He was the ten thousand DAOs, and the ten thousand DAOs worshipped him.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The inner world surrounded heaven and earth, shrouding huntian. Huntian's expression changed slightly, and he felt a slight headache. Li Hao and the human King were both very young, but they were also two people he did not want to provoke.They were all crazy!The older they were, the more afraid they were of death. The younger they were ... The less they cared about their lives.Long Zhan, on the other hand, heaved a sigh of relief when he saw some black Qi appearing on Li Hao's face. He had many tricks up his sleeve, but unfortunately, he had still underestimated huntian. Even if huntian had been taken advantage of by the human King, Li Hao ... He was going to have a good time!Li Hao, however, smiled again.Looking at long Zhan, he blocked with his sword. The order heavenly policy still appeared in front of him as a shield to block long Zhan's attack, while he continued to gather the power of order that had darkened.Long Zhan attacked crazily!Boom! Boom! Boom!At this moment, the heavenly policy of order was constantly trembling from his attacks, and some cracks appeared. Long Zhan was becoming more and more ferocious, and at this moment, it was as if his ferocity had been completely aroused."Split!"BOOM!The heavenly policy of order had already been cracked by Li Hao's group. At this moment, the crack seemed to be even bigger.Crack ... Crack ...A faint cracking sound began to appear.Long Zhan was overjoyed!Not only would Li Hao be done for if the heavenly policy of order was destroyed, but chaos heaven would also be weakened and would no longer be able to Control Order. Even if it could, it would need to re-condense the power of order.Two birds with one stone!This time, he put in even more effort and care.Soon, the crack expanded again.

Li Hao, who had already integrated into the way of order, coughed, and his blood, mixed with a lot of black, flowed out again. He said gloomily,""We really did. Huntian will beat us later and destroy your chaos race!"Long Zhan was cold and did not speak.He would think about it when the time came.Claw!BOOM!The Dao of the fleshly body once again erupted with boundless power.The cracking sound of the heavenly policy of order was heard again. Huntian frowned slightly, but he didn't say anything. At this moment, if the heavenly policy of order wasn't broken, perhaps ... Long Zhan wouldn't be able to do anything to Li Hao.He was being held back by the human King and the others, and it was difficult for him to deal with Li Hao.He might as well destroy Li Hao first and seriously injure him before planning his next move.At this moment, Li Hao was causing trouble again!The divine runes that had seeped out landed in the Western world!At this moment, it began to exude a faint spirituality. The spirituality of darkness and chaos mixed in the order began to overflow.……On the Western edge."What's going on?" the chaos Emperor, who was still hiding from the detection, suddenly raised his eyebrows. He had a thought. In the void, order was dissipating, darkness was invading, and the power of Chaos was fluctuating wildly.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The chaotic spirits that he had destroyed began to gather again at an extremely fast speed!It was as if ... It would awaken at any moment!The chaos Emperor was stunned. The next moment, he seemed to understand something. Li Hao was still in control of order, but his order had been invaded by darkness. In order to seize control of the West with Li Hao, huntian kept releasing his primitive desire and chaos darkness ...All of a sudden, the entire chaos was stimulated and fell into darkness and chaos.In addition, this group of experts was fighting madly, causing the chaos to become even more chaotic. The spirituality that had been destroyed not long ago was now in the midst of recovery!The chaos Emperor's expression changed slightly.This ... Was so fast!If this continued, he would be able to recover his previous strength and become a peak expert, no weaker than when he fought huntian."Li Hao?"He mumbled to himself. This guy ... Was he doing this on purpose or not? His divine text was scattered all over the world, and at this moment, it was overflowing with spirituality, urging the growth of the chaotic spirituality.The chaos Emperor's face kept changing.Without his spirituality, he was only an Ordinary Level eight. With such strength, he wouldn't even rashly join the battle between the Supreme martial artist and the others, let alone the battle between the overlords.Otherwise ... It would be a huge loss if they died there.However, as his spirituality continued to recover and chaos gathered once more, he might become the strongest in a single leap. This was because the power of darkness in chaos heaven had been greatly depleted, and order had been taken away. In addition, human King Chunqiu was currently besieging him ...At this moment, he had consumed a lot of energy.At that time ... He would become the strongest?He was a little excited, but also a little afraid.Li Hao!He must be ... Doing this on purpose.What was he doing?What does he want me to do? The chaos Emperor's expression changed. Did Li Hao want him to awaken his spirit and fight huntian?Why?To deal with huntian and give him the chance to split open the sky?Why should I help Li Hao? none of them are good people. There's no good person in chaos. Huntian, I, and Li Hao are all bad."You're counting on me to take action?"Chaos sneered. How was that possible!If you continue to fight, it's best if both of you are injured. I have to thank you, Li Hao. If I had recovered my peak battle strength ... Perhaps that would be my chance!Just as he was thinking, the chaotic energy around him became stronger and stronger!The spirituality that had been lost was now gathering back at an extremely fast speed. Seeing this, chaos's expression changed slightly. It was so F * cking fast!Run first!Let's talk after we run.Otherwise, he might be detected when his spirituality gathered. Once he was discovered, huntian might not let Li Hao go out of fear and attack him, which would be bad.Although he wasn't afraid of his opponent after his spirituality recovered, why did he have to become Li Hao's shield?He was just about to escape ...Suddenly, his expression changed completely!At that moment, countless spiritual energies gathered together!……At this moment, the heavenly policy of order that had been resisting the other party was finally destroyed by long Zhan!With a loud boom, the heavenly policy of order was instantly shattered.As for Li Hao, he was sent flying. All his bones were broken, his flesh was shattered, and his order was collapsing.At the same time!The moment the heavenly policy of order exploded, an extremely powerful chaotic force suddenly erupted not far away from them. The chaos venerable Emperor, who was hiding in the dark, couldn't help but curse in a low voice!艹!The heavenly policy of order was shattered?The order had collapsed?How could he be so fast?Order and chaos were opposites. The moment order collapsed, the entire West seemed to have lost all the power of order, while the power of Chaos instantly skyrocketed!All of a sudden, the spirit of chaos appeared, and the aura of the chaos path master could not be concealed.In an instant, an incomparably majestic aura emerged.In the distance, the chaos Emperor was a little helpless and embarrassed.""I'm just passing by, I have no intention of getting involved in your fight ..."As he spoke, he was about to leave!He didn't want to get involved in this.To make a wedding dress for someone else!In order to escape the control of the other level 9s, he had even detonated his own spirituality. It was clear that he wasn't stupid and wouldn't let Li Hao use him as bait and shield!Li Hao is calculative, but I ... Won't fall for it!"Let's run first," chaos thought."My spirituality has recovered, so it'll be difficult to avoid those tier 9 experts. However, there are advantages and disadvantages. Now, his strength has returned to the time when he fought huntian."

"This time, both of us will be injured, and I will be the strongest expert in the chaos!……Huntian's expression was a little ugly.Damn it!He had almost forgotten the existence of chaos, but he had no choice just now. If order was not broken, Li Hao would split open the sky sooner or later. If order was broken, chaos would be restored. If he was given a choice ...He'd rather use chaos recovery than let Li Hao continue to struggle.At this moment, chaos had indeed returned.He was a little irritated, but at this point ... As long as he didn't get involved in the chaos and cause trouble, he felt that the loss was still bearable.Chaos was obviously a smart person.He would not interfere at this moment!"Li Hao!" Huntian said in a deep voice,"Li Hao, you're hoping chaos will help you ... In your dreams!"You must be dreaming!Today, I'd rather see chaos recover and leave, becoming a great disaster, than let you go, you bastard!The order of the entire West was collapsing.The chaotic aura was getting stronger and stronger, but it was also rapidly escaping!Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn couldn't hold it in any longer."Li Hao!"I've had enough!Huntian didn't die, long Zhan didn't die, you played yourself into a seriously injured state and revived chaos, the shit stirrer. If this goes on, there will be more and more enemies in chaos. On the other hand, I must have gone crazy to choose to be on your side. I'm afraid we'll be in big trouble next!The human King hadn't backed out yet, but she was ready to back out!I'll let you get beaten to death!At this moment, Li Hao, who had just fused with order, was seriously injured by the collapse of order. Although the fusion was not complete, he kept coughing up blood.Long Zhan also seized the opportunity, bombarding over violently!What's the point of reviving chaos? Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  No one is stupid. Who would be controlled by you?Li Hao, you've overestimated yourself and underestimated others."BOOM!"As the sound spread, half of Li Hao's body was blown up almost instantly. Blood and flesh flew in all directions, and blood splattered all over the world."Ha ..." Li Hao sneered.Just as long Zhan was preparing to go one step further and completely kill this fellow.Li Hao looked into the distance at the chaos that was escaping.Entering the trap, taking the benefits, and then wanting to leave ... How could there be such a good thing in the world?There wasn 't!There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world."My spirituality isn't that delicious ..."Li Hao mumbled. At this moment, his body was shattered, and blood spurted out. The spirituality that he had gathered earlier had turned into chaotic spirituality.Tens of thousands of spiritual lights flashed! The fleeing chaos path master had also sensed something strange and thought that it was a huge problem. He was just about to suppress the revival of these spiritual lights ...However, the next moment, he was slightly stunned.He was a little dazed!It was not under Li Hao's control, but at this moment ... In the Dao of chaos that he controlled, the ten thousand weak traces of spirituality suddenly ... Began to emit light. In an instant, the ten thousand traces of spirituality seemed to ... Converge into a star.A faint time energy appeared around him.At this moment, in the depths of the chaos great Dao, someone suddenly exclaimed.In the next moment, even the master of tianfang's expression changed slightly.At the same time, many level 9s exclaimed,""Not good!"艹!Li Hao was completely mad!He ... He had cut the spirituality of time into thousands of rays of spiritual light and gathered them into the spirit of chaos. At this moment, chaos Dao master was condensing the Dao of time!As for the chaos Emperor, he had originally been prepared to suppress it.But now ... He was stunned and hesitated for a moment. Then ... He couldn't hold it in anymore.He really couldn't resist ... Temptation!"Li Hao, are you crazy?" he roared.Li Hao was currently depriving himself of his control over time and transferring the power of time to the spirit of chaos. In this way, he became the second generation time inheritor, the appointed third generation time inheritor!Time ... Did not seem to resist either!It was actually ... It was really gathering around him. If this continued, his identity as the master of chaos might ... Transform into the master of time.Furthermore, he was a rank 9 time King!"You're welcome, lingyue ... Make way ..."Li Hao's laughter resounded.Queen lingyue immediately left her divine Kingdom. She didn't understand what Li Hao was doing, but she knew ... She had to listen to Li Hao, or she would die a horrible death!As expected, she had just withdrawn from the chaos great Dao.In an instant, illusory figures appeared and froze. The original body had not descended, but at that moment, all the rank 9s, including the Lord of the Outlander domain, formed clones.No matter how strong or weak they were, no matter how strong they were, no matter how great their losses would be after they fell ...At this moment, these level 9 experts couldn't hold it in any longer!Even if they had to kill the trillions of humans, even if they were infected by their faith, they would still come.Li Hao was in control of time. That was still acceptable. After all, he wasn't strong.But ... With chaos, who was originally a level nine venerable sovereign, controlling time, and the collapse of order and the strengthening of chaos, if this continued ... They might completely lose all chances!He had lost the chance to return!Images began to appear, and in the blink of an eye, all the power of the great Dao in the world was being extracted to rapidly strengthen the clone.Level nine venerable sovereigns appeared in the sky above the West.There were more than 20 of them!Tian Fang's voice was filled with anger and disbelief as he roared,""Well done, Li Hao, you lunatic ...""Bastard!""Three generations of time, is it chaos?""We can't let him control it! He can seize time and kill chaos!"

“……”Long Zhan and the others were also dumbstruck!They watched helplessly as powerful figures appeared one after another above their heads. One, two, three ...Just one of them wasn't as powerful as them.However, when more than twenty illusory figures appeared, each of which had the power of seven or eight thousand Dao ...Such an existence and so many powerhouses were enough to reverse the world!Meanwhile, the chaos path master laughed bitterly as he looked at Li Hao in the distance ... And couldn't help but sigh.“艹! I ... I can't help it!"He really couldn't help it.Time had gathered, and he was about to become the third generation time King ... Not only that, he was still at the ninth step.If I can endure it, I'm not human.Li Hao, Li Hao!You lunatic, you're ... Forcing me into a dead end.At this moment, even huntian and Chunqiu were anxious.Long Zhan was also anxious!Not good!Once chaos took control of time, even the sky would collapse. The entire chaos would fall into the control of chaos!"Li Hao, you're a sinner ... A sinner of chaos!"Long Zhan roared. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "You damn thing!" Huntian roared."If you had given it to me, we might have been able to talk about splitting open the sky. Why Him?"He was exasperated!He could no longer maintain any grace.You said earlier that time is mine, so what if I split open the sky for you!艹!To create chaos and fight with us, what are you thinking?On the other hand, the human King clicked his tongue and was really ... Lively!This time, it was completely lively.He had said long ago that no human could resist the temptation of time. Li Hao wasn't human, but chaos was. Even if he knew the danger, even if he knew that everyone would stop him, chaos ... Would never give up!This time, there was really a good show to watch!The human king's mouth split open!This was going to be lively. At this time, more than 20 powerful eighth-grade auras appeared in the surroundings. The chaos in the distance also had incomparably powerful auras, and they were recovering to their peak from a million years ago.Tian Fang's clone roared,"stop the battle! Kill the chaos!" We can't let chaos become the time King!" Long Zhan was also gnashing his teeth at this moment, wanting to kill Li Hao first. Li Hao's voice was faint.""I can't die. If I die, chaos will completely control time. If I die, even if I kill chaos, no one will be able to inherit time. Time ... Will completely dissipate into chaos!"When the tianfang clone heard these words, he instantly roared,""A few people, protect Li Hao and kill the chaos! Long Zhan, you can't kill him. If you dare to kill him, I'll exterminate your entire clan!"Long Zhan was stunned and could not bear it any longer. He roared angrily,""So what if I kill him and let time completely dissipate?""F * ck you!"The group of level 9 spiritual beasts cursed at the same time!When time is gone, we will never be able to return to the past. What do you know, you beast!In an instant, three figures headed straight for long Zhan. Their powerful auras swept through the world.If long Zhan dared to kill Li Hao, he would first exterminate the chaos race!As for Li Hao, half of his body was gone. At this moment, he unhurriedly retreated with a bright smile, but he looked extremely evil.Yes, I've mastered it, so you're not afraid.Chaos?To let him master it ... Are you afraid?You're all afraid!"After all is said and done, I'm not strong enough, so you guys don't have to be so afraid, but letting chaos take control ... There'll be a good show to watch.He looked at long Zhan out of the corner of his eye and smiled, with provocation and madness.,m You ... Kill me!At this moment, the master of Tian Fang, who was charging toward the chaos, turned around and glanced at Li Hao. Seeing the smile on Li Hao's face, a thought emerged in the depths of his heart ... He had to find a way to kill this guy!Even if he had to split open the sky for him today, he would make sure that another generation of time cultivators emerged. As long as it wasn't li Hao, chaos, or any other level nine, he would accept it.He had to kill Li Hao!He was too crazy! He even dared to give up on time! He could give up on time!Li Hao seemed to have seen him too. He waved his remaining arm and smiled again.You ... Will help me split open the sky!Am I right?You'd rather let someone else be in charge than me. Have I ... Made you afraid?The long Zhan opposite, his enormous eyes were filled with rage.He couldn't bear it any longer and charged at Li Hao. No... He had to kill Li Hao no matter what. It would be best if time was completely destroyed!He was afraid!Yes, he was afraid of Li Hao.He also ignored the three powerful figures behind him.I don't care, I must kill Li Hao!
