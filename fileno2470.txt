Time and Stars flew all over the world.Li Hao merged with the time star and disappeared.Second cat was still in a daze, probably not completely awake yet. Heaven's Fate hurriedly raised his sword to guard him, in case someone went crazy ...In fact, some people were really going crazy at this moment.On the other side, li daoheng seemed to have gone mad!Lightning tribulation!Venerable sovereigns originally had no tribulation ... But since there was one, they had to go through it!Now, there was no tribulation.He really didn't have any more ... He was still walking on the Dao of origin. He hadn't cultivated a new Dao to the half-step sovereign level. In this case ... Wouldn't he never become a sovereign without tribulation?All his plans were instantly in vain.Everything had become a joke!What do you mean by being on the same level as a human Emperor and surpassing Emperor Cang? Emperor Cang came from a distance and didn't even cross time. He was only a projection here and swallowed the lightning tribulation. Or rather, the true body of the lightning tribulation was in the hands of Emperor Cang!It said that it would cross it a few days later.This 'a few days'... How many days was it?Emperor Cang was a forgetful person. Would he still remember this?Even if he remembered ... Was its days the same as the days of the Silver Moon?"Hahaha!"At this moment, Zheng Yu also laughed out loud. He laughed so hard that he didn't know what was going on. His power was depleting rapidly, but he still laughed madly."Li daoheng!"Let's fight!Up until today, time had reversed and Emperor Cang had appeared, disrupting all of their plans. Li daoheng's eyes were as cold as ice. He looked at the stars that were moving around the world and said coldly,"There's still a chance!"Did I?There were!"The Paragon sovereign's tribulation is gone, but the time and space are still here! The two Dao universes still exist!"Who said there was no chance?If he couldn't become a monarch with his great Dao of origins, he would use a new Dao to become a Monarch!Who said there was no chance?What was Zheng Yu laughing about? What's so funny!Besides, if I really take down the time star, perhaps ... I can reverse the past to the time before Li Hao summoned Emperor Cang. In that case, I might be able to transcend the Tribulation again and become an Emperor with my origin and a new Dao, becoming one!He held up the sky with one hand and grabbed the river of chaos. A rumbling sound was heard. Li daoheng looked coldly into the distance."Li Hao, do you think that it has nothing to do with you now that you've given up the truth Dao universe? Breaking the chaotic River, Hong Yitang's death, the destruction of all DAOs, and the Silver Moon returning to its original state ... You, the Heaven's Will, won't get any benefits! Now, all you need to do is give up the time stars and reverse time, returning to the moment before Emperor Cang appeared ... I have no intention of dealing with you!"Although he hadn't proven his Dao and become a sovereign, his aura had indeed surpassed that of an ordinary half-sovereign ... Everything had reached the standard of a venerable sovereign. The only thing he hadn't been able to pass the Tribulation and become a true venerable sovereign.At this moment, he was still extremely powerful!Even Heaven's Fate knew that they were probably no match for the other party.The other party had swallowed too much of Zheng Yu's power. At this time, li daoheng should be able to fight with the red moon sovereign. Although the venerable sovereign was a venerable sovereign, he had lost a lot of strength. After being sealed for many years, he was probably at this level.Of course, Heaven's Fate didn't care anymore. He looked at the blinked eyes of the confused second cat and was extremely excited!He was resurrected!Not only had he been resurrected, Emperor Cang had also noticed them. Although he seemed to be in the middle of a battle and was unable to come, or perhaps he was not interested in coming over ... But ... With Emperor Cang's attention here, no matter how proud li daoheng was, would he still dare to touch er Mao?Emperor Cang was able to stop him from vindicating his Dao through tribulation. Now that he was moving, he once again attracted Emperor Cang's attention ... Did li daoheng dare to bet that Emperor Cang really wouldn't come?And that huge star was crazily moving.He seemed to be very dissatisfied with Li Hao!After being fused with by Li Hao ... He no longer felt free. Even if Li Hao coaxed him like he was coaxing a child, the time star still kept on escaping.At that moment, the ninth master roared in the distance,""Li daoheng, things have already come to this. Do you still want to continue making mistakes? Emperor Cang and the others are still here, the human King is still here. Even if you win in Silver Moon, what can you do?"With the appearance of Emperor Cang, it was time to shatter their fantasies!New martial was still there!At this moment, there was still a chance ... Yes, there was still a chance. Even if li daoheng really killed all the Li family members, there might still be a chance. If they found neo martial, these people could still be resurrected!  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ He was resurrected and Li daoheng admitted his mistake. He killed venerable Red Moon sovereign and joined the battle as a death warrior. He was close to becoming a venerable sovereign and could even prove his Dao at any time.As long as he survived a few battles and made a contribution by killing the enemy ... He would still have a chance.Emperor Cang was still fighting ... Which meant that the war was not over yet.Once the war was over, there would be no chance at all."You've already made a mistake,"the ninth Division commander bellowed." If you keep making mistakes, there's no chance of turning back!" Kill Red Moon sovereign, take Silver Moon to neo martial, apologize to revered sword, and ask the human King to resurrect the people you killed. You just have to kill a few venerable sovereigns ... And you'll still have a way out!"Li daoheng looked at him coldly, his eyes icy."A way out? Why are you always so stupid! What I'm pursuing is something you will never understand! So, I'm a strong practitioner who's about to become an Emperor, and you're a piece of trash who only knows how to Shout! If it wasn't for Emperor Cang causing trouble, I would have already become an Emperor and this is my fate. But where did I go wrong?"If not for Emperor Cang's sudden appearance, he would have devoured the dual-Dao universes, the time stars, Li Hao, the half-Emperor heaven's will, two cats, blood saber, Red Moon Emperor, and the Silver Moon world ...Even if he wasn't as good as Emperor Cang, he wouldn't be an ordinary venerable sovereign. At that time, where couldn't he go in the chaos?Wandering the chaos, there might be even greater opportunities waiting for him!

Chapter 2471 Let's Play Together (2)
Go back to new martial arts and apologize?Not to mention if a figure like the human King would let him go, even if he really didn't kill him, he would be treated as a death row convict. If he didn't kill all the strong enemies, would he still have any chance?To give up on becoming a top-tier venerable sovereign and gamble on the mercy of a human King ... This brother of his was really stupid!Although there was a slight difference and the Time and Stars messed up his plan.But ... I haven't lost yet! He was still an invincible existence!Even if the red moon sovereign himself appeared, he could still fight. Why should he admit his mistake?I'm not wrong!Furthermore ... The chaotic River of the truth Dao universe, the myriad Dao River, was in his hands. What had he done wrong?He didn't care about Heaven's Fate, second cat, or the ninth Division.In his eyes, these people were nothing.He didn't even take Li Hao seriously.This included Zheng Yu, this good-for-nothing, who had always been self-righteous, but in reality, he was just too lazy to pay attention to it. He was only waiting for the great Dao universe to appear, waiting for a greater opportunity, an opportunity to reach the heavens in one step!He had been waiting!It had been right in front of him, but Li Hao had ruined it. No, it had actually been ruined by Time and Stars.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Out of curiosity and doubt, this star provided Li Hao with a lot of time power, which allowed Emperor Cang to project it over. Otherwise ... With Emperor Cang's power, Li Hao's summoning of er Mao ... Would only result in his death!It would directly cause him to die of old age!The more this was the case, the more it proved the great potential of this star. Although it was not enough to carry Emperor Cang, the great Dao universe had just been born. This meant that the potential of this star was limitless!As he continued to extract Zheng Yu's power, he began to merge with the river of chaos without any delay. Furthermore, he himself headed straight for the star.While the stars were still weak, they could still be captured.When they became stronger ... Even he would not have the chance to capture them.A powerful aura enveloped the entire Silver Moon.The sword on his back appeared instantly and slashed towards the void. The void was immediately compressed. Time and Stars were originally escaping, but at this moment, under this sword, it was as if they had crossed thousands of mountains and rivers and were getting closer and closer to him!At this moment, Li Hao was still trying to merge with the time star with great difficulty. He felt helpless.He was too strong!It was stronger than expected and the fusion was very difficult. Moreover, summoning Emperor Cang previously consumed a lot of energy. If he didn't summon Emperor Cang, he might not even be able to fuse.At least there was still a chance now.However...When he saw li daoheng blocking his way, Li Hao couldn't help but be angry and resentful.""Zheng Yu, aren't you a burden? Haven't you been scheming for a hundred thousand years? You don't have any way at all? Let him devour you?" Wasn't this guy full of confidence?Why did he suddenly wither?Resist!If he swallows you, you swallow him!Zheng Yu, who had been sucked into li daoheng's hand until he was practically skin and bones, laughed somewhat mournfully."To you, isn't it the same whether he or I win?"He seemed to have given up struggling. He was in pain and despair."The Dao sword and the earth-overturning sword were all pawns he used to mislead me ... Unfortunately, I really thought that he had reincarnated! Even ... When you killed that kid from the wind cloud Pavilion, he was also a pawn to mislead me. He made me think that ... Reincarnation is possible!"He coughed, blood flowing, and said with some regret,""The song ... Was really not spread by me ... It was ... He spread it himself! "I've been thinking a few times that if he's playing this song, does it mean that he's being held back by me and has no choice, so ... He can only play this song to vent his anger ..."He had once asked himself and told himself that he was not the one who had taught him the song.It was definitely li daoheng!From the looks of it now, li daoheng had spread it himself to mislead him. He had been dragging him down and had unknowingly fallen into his path.Buzzzzzz!Li daoheng didn't reply to Zheng Yu's words as his long sword cut through the air.At this moment, he was going to kill Li Hao and take the star.As for the rest ... They were all fabricated.Zheng Yu was just an insignificant fellow on the path of life. All these years, he had only fought with him for fun. It was too boring to be alone. With Zheng Yu around, he would not be lonely for a hundred thousand years.Time and Stars flickered, and sword nets appeared in all directions!At this moment, the celestial pole looked at second cat and said,""I'll go over there to help ... Don't move, he won't dare to kill you!"Second cat blinked its eyes and looked around curiously. It nodded obediently.He wasn't as cunning as Emperor Cang, but he was more honest.Heaven's Fate saw this and didn't say anything. He quickly raised his sword and attacked. Although that guy was strong, he wasn't to be trifled with. Now that ermao had recovered, he had one less knot in his heart.……At the same time.The chaos River in li daoheng's hand was struggling violently. Hong Yitang's face appeared with some pain. He couldn't escape. At this moment, half of the river had spread into li daoheng's body.He had devoured it!If this continued, he would soon become a part of li daoheng.He had originally thought that he could help Li Hao, but now, he had become a resource for the powerful li daoheng.At this moment, Zheng Yu also looked pained as he glanced at Hong Yitang. Suddenly, a smile appeared in his eyes. Hong Yitang was slightly stunned. Why are you still smiling at this time?

Chapter 2472 Let's Play Together (3)
Ever since Zheng Yu had been devoured by li daoheng, he had almost no power to resist. A top-notch half-Emperor actually couldn't resist. It was obvious that he had been infiltrated too deeply. Because of his greed, he had been trying to merge with li daoheng, but he had been infiltrated instead.At that moment, the powerless Zheng Yu looked at him and started to laugh.A silent laugh!Li daoheng was displaying his unparalleled sword intent, which enveloped the world. He wanted to capture and trap Li Hao and time star. He didn't care about the two people in his hands anymore. They were just defeated opponents!At this moment, Zheng Yu's voice appeared in Hong Yitang's mind. It was a little fierce and unwilling."I couldn't beat him! But he ... Can forget about beating me so easily!""Don't give him the chance to merge reality and illusion ... He's not that scary! If he could defeat me so easily, he would have killed me long ago!""Although I didn't see through him ... I still have some doubts ... Of course, it's too late to say all this ... I'll find an opportunity to escape later!"Zheng Yu was full of smiles, not because he found his conscience.He just didn't want li daoheng to win everything so easily. Since I couldn't beat you ... Don't even think about beating me!You've been fighting for 100000 years and you treat me as a chess piece. Do you really think you're stronger than me?Hong Yitang was slightly shocked.At this moment, li daoheng, who was trying to trap and kill Li Hao, suddenly had a thought. He lowered his head and looked at Zheng Yu, who was smiling brightly.At this moment, Tian Ji's blade came from behind!Li daoheng felt that something was amiss, but at this moment, celestial pole's blade was not weak either. He didn't have time to think about it and turned around to attack!Zheng Yu smiled. This was the moment he had been waiting for!Suddenly, a star Phantom appeared in li daoheng's body and trembled slightly. It was the void Dao universe that Zheng Yu had fused with previously, the void Dao star.At this instant, The Phantom Dao star suddenly burst out with countless Starlight!Among them, a few stars suddenly stood out from the countless stars and instantly appeared. In the distance, Qian Wuliang who was suppressing the ancient city changed his expression as a surge of overwhelming power emerged from his body!In the blink of an eye, the stars in li daoheng's body shone with boundless and powerful light!"Let's play to the end!"Zheng Yu laughed.BOOM!In an instant, The Phantom Dao stars shattered and merged into the stars. In the distance, Qian Wuliang's aura skyrocketed, but his physical body couldn't keep up and exploded. However, he didn't die.A vast spiritual power appeared on the spot, and Qian Wuliang turned into his human form with a slight vibration.What was going on?He had once ventured deep into the void Dao universe in order to investigate the truth of the void Dao universe. However, he had always kept a low profile, afraid that li daoheng or Zheng Yu would discover him. Thus, he did not dare to move.However, today ... Looking at the situation, Zheng Yu had actually discovered it long ago, but he had just left it alone.Whether it was to guard against Li Hao or li daoheng, he had merged these stars into the depths of his Galaxy and hidden them. At this moment, he had extracted the power of the entire Galaxy and fused it with these stars."Haha!" He laughed."I prepared it for Li Hao ... But ... You took it!"   Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao wanted to merge with the void Dao universe, and he also wanted to merge with the Dao universe.Li Hao might have left some trouble in the reality Dao universe to balance him, and he wanted to give Li Hao a surprise. If he lost and was inferior to Li Hao, he would do the same if Li Hao devoured the void Dao universe.He merged the power of Phantom path into Qian Wuliang's body.Let this ambitious guy choose whether to be eaten by Li Hao or to resist ... It might be very interesting!In the end, Li Hao abandoned the reality-level universe and stopped playing.Li daoheng, on the other hand, had swallowed his virtual Dao universe.Boom! Boom! Boom!The River of Stars shattered, and a few stars fled. Just as the long saber came down, li daoheng grunted and frowned slightly. He snorted coldly,""Foolish!"It was obvious that this was Zheng Yu's preparation for failure.However, in li daoheng's opinion, since he had already left, there was no need to consider failure. If he considered failure, he would definitely lose.Therefore, he would not consider this.In the end, Zheng Yu wasn't him. Zheng Yu had been thinking about what would happen if he failed.At this moment, he gave the answer.If I fail ... I'll also disgust Li Hao and help the ambitious Qian Wuliang master the power of The Phantom Dao universe so that he can be Li Hao's equal!But now, he failed to disgust Li Hao.However, he had disgusted li daoheng.BOOM!The sound of an explosion came from his body, making li daoheng slightly startled. The blood saber slashed down, and behind him, Time and Stars suddenly rushed over!Li daoheng shouted coldly, and a sword came down from the sky!A sword seemed to have appeared in front of everyone!He, who was infinitely close to a venerable sovereign, also went all out in this sword. The sword intent was boundless and murderous. Zheng Yu kept laughing. Suddenly, the last bit of strength burst out from his body and he chuckled."I said that I can drag you down, and you said the same thing ... Then ... I'll drag you down again!"BOOM!The sword intent suddenly dispersed. Li daoheng looked down with a cold face. His hand fell, and with a boom, he was torn to pieces!However, Zheng Yu was still alive. There was a crazy smile on his broken face.I'm still holding you back!The moment the sword intent dissipated, a few void Dao stars instantly fled. On the other side, the chaos River also instantly escaped from the huge suction force. Hong Yitang turned into a human and turned to look at Zheng Yu with a complicated expression.

Chapter 2473 Let's Play Together (3)
Zheng Yu was not trying to save him!Zheng Yu had only wanted to disgust li daoheng. In order to not fulfill li daoheng's wish, he had fought for so many years but lost in the end. He thought that victory was in his grasp, but he had been killed instead. He was not willing to accept this.But ... It was indeed his burst of power that had stopped li daoheng.Zheng Yu's physical body instantly crumbled, but his laughter still lingered.""Li daoheng, I've lost! I admit it! And you? Can you win? You ... Can't win!"BOOM!It exploded completely. At that moment, a great Dao appeared. It was his great Dao of origins.However, at this moment, his illusionary image appeared with some regret.""The great Dao depends on me. A neo martial artist might be able to resurrect me ... Unfortunately, who will resurrect you, a traitor of neo martial arts? I've played enough in this world. At least ... After all these years, I'm the one in charge. You, li daoheng, are even darker than me. You haven't even been the master of the world for a day, while I've been the master for a hundred thousand years!"He laughed madly. I've been a Paragon for at least a hundred thousand years!Even if ... It was so fake!However, everyone knows that I've been in control of everything for the past one hundred thousand years. You, li daoheng, are just a rat in the dark. How are you any better than me?You're worse off!BOOM!A half-step sovereign had broken his origin source bed. At this moment, countless origin source energy was overflowing between the heaven and earth. Zheng Yu's voice still resounded in the heaven and earth,"Li Hao, I won't play with you anymore! You killed my father and brother ... And I killed your entire family ... Ying Hongyue was just a chess piece that I raised ... We're even now, hahaha!"Ying Hongyue's eight meridians had indeed been cultivated by him.As for himself, he was also at the stage of eight meridians merging into one. Originally, victory was within his grasp. In the end, he had been tricked by li daoheng at his peak. Now, he had also dragged li daoheng down. He was very proud of himself!It was as if he was saying,"I may have lost, but I ... Didn't lose!"BOOM!The sky cracked open, and the world seemed to be collapsing. This was the first time a half-step sovereign had truly fallen in the Silvermoon world, a half-step sovereign that had a high chance of entering the venerable sovereign realm.Venerable sovereigns were strong in any era.Originally, he had passed the venerable sovereign tribulation and had a chance of becoming a venerable sovereign. However, he and Li daoheng were not willing to simply become a venerable sovereign. They wanted to go one step further. Even if they were not as good as the human King, they could not be too far away.However, today ... He would die.All his grand plans and great undertakings were all in vain.The death of his father and brother was actually within his expectations, but he did not care. As long as he succeeded, whether it was resurrection or something else, it did not matter. Even if the great Dao of origin was broken, he could find the human King to resurrect him or help the red moon break through new martial arts ... There was still hope of resurrection.Besides, at this point, he didn't care too much.However, all of this was for naught. Not far away, Qian Wuliang's physical body completely exploded, and his body turned illusionary. It was constructed by mind power, and he instantly turned into a human. His aura skyrocketed, and the energy of the entire void Dao universe instantly surged into his Natal star.Qian Wuliang was both shocked and scared, but he was also a little happy.His aura also instantly skyrocketed. In the blink of an eye, he reached the sixth level of Dao integration, which was on par with Hong Yitang, who controlled the truth Dao universe.He followed closely behind, and like Hong Yitang, one controlled Phantom path and the other controlled truth path!The two of them were both at the sixth level of the Dao integration realm. Bang! Bang!A deafening sound resounded through the world. Tian Ji forced li daoheng back with a single slash. Behind him, Li Hao forcefully merged with Time and Stars and collided with li daoheng. Li daoheng spat out a mouthful of blood, but he wasn't angry.He only took a glance at the sky and the great path that had exploded. He swept his gaze across coldly.Zheng Yu!Good job!I gave you a nickname, and you took it seriously. At the critical moment, you did this. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Li daoheng's aura dropped slightly.However, Zheng Yu was dead, and the devouring power had lost the other party's Mark and integrated into his body. Although the dual-Dao universe Masters had run away, he had devoured a lot of energy before.At this moment, li daoheng wasn't much weaker than before. However, he had lost his dual-Dao universes and his hope of becoming a new Dao Emperor had been destroyed!At this moment, Qian Wuliang floated over from the distance and met the fleeing Hong Yitang. The two of them looked at each other and didn't speak.Li daoheng sneered."Dual-Dao universe Masters ... You're only at the sixth level of Dao integration and at the peak of the Heavenly King realm. You can't participate in our battle. Why don't you devour each other and see who's stronger? if you succeed, you'll definitely be half-step sovereigns and might even get a share of the loot!"Since things had come to this, he didn't care anymore.At this moment, both Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang were on guard against each other.They were both only at the sixth level of the Dao integration realm, so they couldn't participate in a battle between half-step sovereigns or even venerable sovereigns. However, if they could merge, they might have a chance!If he succeeded, he might be able to vindicate Dao and become an Emperor.Hong Yitang was on high alert. He was very weak at the moment, while Qian Wuliang was ambitious. He was suppressed by Li Hao before, but neither Li Hao nor Heaven's Fate had time to deal with them.If ... This fellow really had the intention to devour him, he might very well succeed.And Li Hao indeed didn't have time to care.He and Heaven's Fate, one in front and one behind, blocked li daoheng.

Chapter 2474 Let's Play Together (3)_5
Li Hao transformed into a human. However, a star was still moving inside his body, making his aura unstable.Then, he glanced at Qian Wuliang ...At the last moment, Zheng Yu chose to strengthen Qian Wuliang's Natal star and merge the power of void Dao. It had to be said that the person he chose was in line with Zheng Yu's personality. He just wanted to disgust Qian Wuliang. If the winner was Li Hao, he might be as unhappy as li daoheng.Qian Wuliang...It was fine when he was weak, but this guy was tactful.But now, he was at the sixth level of the Dao integration realm. After swallowing Hong Yitang, he could also become a half-step sovereign and even merge his two DAOs. There was still hope for him to swallow Time and Stars, which would be the true great Dao universe.Now, Qian Wuliang's betrayal was a big trouble for Li Hao.As for li daoheng, he could naturally tell as well. He chuckled,""Qian Wuliang, you're just a nobody. This might be your only chance in your life. I'll attack Li Hao and the others. As long as you can swallow Hong Yitang and summon the time star, you'll definitely become a top-tier half-Emperor or even a venerable sovereign ... By then, I don't mind having a fight with you!" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt As soon as he finished speaking, he slashed out with his long sword again!Li Hao swung his sword at the same time. On the other side, celestial pole slashed his saber. The three experts fought fiercely in the void, and the entire Silver Moon was shrouded in boundless pressure. The weaker ones had long been frozen by time, while the stronger ones could barely resist the power of time. They watched in fear.At this moment, no one else could interfere.Qian Wuliang looked at Hong Yitang and suddenly said,""Dean Hong, li daoheng has a point. Although we're both at the sixth level of Dao integration, I'm afraid we can't participate in this battle ... But if we become one, we might have a chance ...""You?" Hong Yitang's eyes were cold."You want to devour me?""No way!" Qian Wuliang said in a hurry."It's just ... It's just a temporary integration. Let's try it. You and I can help each other to kill the enemy for the Marquis!"Hong Yitang didn't trust him!Once the two universes were completely fused, the time star, which was the core of the two universes, might break free from Li Hao and choose to return. At that time ... Li Hao would be in big trouble.Of course, if Qian Wuliang was sincere in cooperating with Li Hao and became a half-step sovereign, he would be of some help to Li Hao.But today, he had experienced so much.Hong Yitang didn't trust these people anymore.Even the stupid Queen knew how to scheme and escape from his control.The seemingly shrewd Zheng Yu was now dead. He had not been able to defeat li daoheng. If Li Hao had not fed the two cats, the powerful Heaven's Fate would probably have been beaten to death by now, not daring to resist.Even someone as strong as li daoheng was played by Zheng Yu before he died. He didn't even have the chance to prove his Dao as a venerable Emperor.All of this kept changing, and he didn't dare to trust anyone other than Li Hao.In order to prove their Dao and become emperors, these people ... Would they really be willing to fall behind others?Qian Wuliang was always obedient, but he was not.He glanced at Li Hao out of the corner of his eye. Li Hao hadn't completely mastered the stars yet. Even when he joined hands with Heaven's Fate, he could barely contend with li daoheng. His two swords and one saber were moving unhindered. More importantly, he knew that Li Hao had borrowed the power of the future once.Now, Li Hao's power of time had been greatly consumed, and he had become a pseudo-Emperor ... Except for the thousand DAOs sword, which didn't match the future self from last time, everything else matched.And the thousand swords couldn't be the only basis of judgment ... If Li Hao suddenly lost his strength at this moment, it would be troublesome.……In the void, the three of them were engaged in a fierce battle!The heavens fell and the earth cracked!While fighting, Li Hao forcibly suppressed the time star. The little guy was disobedient and was still running around. Li Hao kept comforting it. "Be good. After I kill this guy, I'll summon something fun for you. That cat, if you want to see it, I'll summon it for you to play with next time ..."The stars trembled. I'm not playing.It was terrifying!It was curious before, but not now. It had the heart of the great Dao and was connected to the cat. It could feel the cat's power and horror. Moreover ... If it really met the other party, it might be eaten!Li Hao's heart skipped a beat, and he thought, you don't want to play? Otherwise, I'll summon it again and let it eat you!"“……”The star seemed to tremble. He even forgot, or perhaps didn't expect, that Li Hao couldn't be summoned by himself. Li Hao died before the other party appeared. However, he shuddered at the thought of the cat breaking the power of the river!Li Hao's mind was slightly distracted, and with a crack, his arm flew up and was cut off by li daoheng's sword. Li daoheng turned his sword around and forced Heaven's Fate to retreat. He said coldly,""Since things have come to this, and the two of you are unwilling to fulfill my wish, then let's play something bigger together. Zheng Yu is dead, and there's no one left to play with!"As soon as he finished speaking, the seal above the Silver City suddenly shook!Inside the seal, sword city suddenly started to shake.Originally, the inner and outer eight cities were sealed. Red Moon sovereign's original body was still sealed and could not break free for a while. But at this moment, sword city suddenly trembled and the seal's power instantly overflowed!"You want to release him?" Li Hao turned his head and smiled.He didn't seem to be nervous and laughed."Then let them out ... Since you like to play, one more won't make a difference. Let's play together!""Withdraw the seven main cities!"Li Hao's eyes glinted with ferocity as he shouted,""Martial uncle Hong, Qian Wuliang, you don't need to participate in the battle. Withdraw the seven main cities and merge them into one to protect the central mainland!"At this moment, Hong Yitang didn't say anything. He swiftly entered a major city. Some of those who were shocked by time woke up one after another. In the blink of an eye, the seven major cities moved!

The main cities began to evacuate.Li Hao's voice was heard."King of Dali, senior Zhang an, Qian Wuliang, senior uncle Hong ... Take Lin Hongyu away. You guys stay in the seven cities and leave as soon as possible!"The few of them did not dare to say anything more. The Dali King quickly flew to the side and touched the already silent Lin Hongyu ... He cried bitterly in his heart, is she dead?Li Hao, don't think that I killed her. This woman ... Died a long time ago.He didn't say anything and hurriedly grabbed her ... But his arm was instantly filled with a wave of deathly aura, which caused it to tremble. This woman's deathly aura was very dense.He quickly brought Lin Hongyu into the city.As soon as he entered the city ... He suddenly looked in one direction and was slightly startled. He hesitated for a moment, but still quickly flew out. At this moment, in the void, there was a person floating in a corner.A Queen!The Queen's Silver Moon Power had been taken away by Li Hao and turned into heaven's will. At this moment, the Queen was also extremely weak, but she was still alive. Since Li Hao had borrowed her power, no one cared about her.At this time, the king of Dali flew over, grabbed her in a hurry, and quickly fled into the city, sending a message,""We're not on the same side as Li Hao ... I'll save you once. If you survive ... I don't know if you'll be a scammer!"He didn't have time to think about it anymore. At this moment, the seven major cities were trembling.The seal in the sky began to crack!At this moment, li daoheng was actually going to release that venerable sovereign and seek an opportunity. Li Hao, as he wished, simply had the seven main cities evacuate ... At this moment, everyone no longer cared.Soon, the seven major cities were connected from head to tail, and in an instant, they moved from their original spot.The seven main cities enveloped the entire central mainland.The virtual and real universes appeared, shrouding the seven main cities within. The main cities surrounded the central mainland. Everyone was trembling with fear. A venerable sovereign was about to come out. No matter how weak venerable Red Moon sovereign was, he was still a true venerable sovereign!He might even be stronger than li daoheng at this moment!More importantly ... Who would this person deal with once he appeared?Li Hao?Li daoheng?Or should he kill the two great Dao holders first and devour their great DAOs?Judging from their strength, the other party would deal with Hong Yitang and the others first. This was also the reason why li daoheng chose to break the seal. He had been in sword city for many years and knew it very well.​ Therefore, the sword city was in turmoil, and the seal was about to break.Now that Qi Cheng had retreated, the seal was on the verge of breaking.Sure enough!At this moment, the seal began to crack and a huge eight-trigram array emerged. Behind the eight-trigram array, the red moon Thearch laughed and said,""Interesting, very interesting! What a great show!"Although he hadn't been able to come out, he had investigated the situation and seen everything since Li Hao and the others hadn't stopped him.Emperor Cang's appearance ... Caused him to be slightly flustered.  n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Emperor Cang had said that he would kill people for fun ... He was slightly nervous. However, at this moment, Emperor Cang had disappeared. He didn't care about what was happening in the outside world. At this moment, the seal was broken. Be it li daoheng or Li Hao, they had no hope of attaining Dao and becoming an Emperor.All of a sudden, he dominated the entire Silver Moon!It had been a hundred thousand years!From the moment he entered, he had been schemed against by these people and was trapped in the seal. Today, he had finally officially walked out!BOOM!A monstrous pressure spread out, and the entire Silver City was completely turned into dust and disappeared.He hadn't come out yet, but his aura was violent to the extreme.The next moment, he stomped his foot and the seal cracked open!A human figure appeared in the world."I'm out!"Red Moon sovereign laughed.He smiled in satisfaction and said softly,""I'm not the red moon Emperor you're talking about ... That's the general name of all the red moon emperors. I'm shi Gu, you can call me Shi Gu Emperor!"As he walked forward, the seal beneath his feet shattered. The eight shadows that had been blocking him also began to dissipate. The shadow of the sword Saint also began to dissipate.The Stargate above his head was no longer suppressing him.The Stargate floated in the air and instantly turned into a door, floating at the peak of the world.Red Moon Emperor, or rather, bone erosion Emperor, looked around. He smiled when he saw the central continent in the distance, the two great Dao wielders, and Li Hao and his companions.Finally, he looked at the dazed second cat ... They were very close, but he didn't care anymore.This thing ... It's better not to move for now.If he really attracted the new martial arts Emperor Cang, although he was a venerable sovereign ... There was a high chance that he would be killed by that person and made into dried fish.At this point, all the experts in the entire Silver Moon had either unsealed or broken through.With Zheng Yu's death, Li Hao, Heaven's Fate, li daoheng, and corrosion bone Emperor became Silver moon's strongest four. Strictly speaking, Li Hao was the weakest of the four.Li daoheng's eyes were cold,'Shi Gu, I've given you a chance. Kill those people, swallow the two universes, and destroy the entire Silver Moon human race. The will of the heavens will collapse on its own. It will help you and me, and we ... Can fight again to determine the winner!"After killing all the Silvermoon people, Li Hao would definitely be severely injured.He would deal with Li Hao and Heaven's Fate, seize the time star, devour the two universes, and recover his peak combat strength ... At that time, the two of them would be able to fight and determine the winner!Everything was still within his expectations.Although this was the worst outcome, he had considered it before. In the end, it was still a battle between him and the red moon sovereign.It was just that the process was more tortuous.

Chapter 2476 Let's Play Together (Part 7)
The bone erosion sovereign's aura shook the entire world. He laughed as if he was curious about the world. He looked around and chuckled."Li daoheng, you've trapped me for a hundred thousand years, and now you want to command me? The power of a venerable sovereign is beyond your imagination!"Li daoheng looked indifferent."You're the weakest venerable sovereign. Now that you've lost half of your strength, you might not be my match even if you come to fight me now. What's there to be arrogant about?"He was not afraid of this guy at all!If not for Heaven's Fate and Li Hao's entanglement, he was confident that he could kill this guy if he encountered him alone. It was just that ... The difficulty would be high.Emperor Shi Gu's face turned ugly. These people were all very arrogant.You can't believe it!A group of non-venerable sovereigns did not think highly of him.He was toying with him!Do you really think you've won?He thought to himself,"fine, I'll kill Hong Yitang and the others and take two universes ... But I won't hurt the will of the heavens if I don't destroy the Silvermoon people. I'll make you suffer!"Why did I destroy the Silvermoon Warriors, severely injure Li Hao, and give you a chance?What are you thinking!Of course, if they swallowed the truth path universe, the Silvermoon people might be severely injured, but at least it would not be that serious ...Many thoughts appeared in his mind. At this moment, he was indeed very weak.Of the few people before him, the strongest was li daoheng, and he was no weaker than him. Since that was the case ... He should go and recover his strength first!He disappeared in an instant and flew towards the Silver Moon continent.A powerful pressure shook the entire world.The seven main cities were all shaking. Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang looked extremely serious. No matter how weak a venerable sovereign was, they were no match for him.Even if the two of them fused and reached the seventh level of Dao integration, they would still be no match for a venerable sovereign!They originally thought that a half-step sovereign was the limit, but now, even a venerable sovereign had been released!At this moment, Li Hao took a deep breath."The venerable sovereign has also appeared. Li daoheng, it looks like you won't stop until you achieve your goal today!"Li daoheng didn't say anything and attacked with his sword!Of course!At this point, do you think I'll give you a chance?Today, if Li Hao didn't die, he knew that trouble would officially come. Li Hao had succeeded in capturing the space-time star and advancing to the peak of the half-Emperor realm. Instead of that, he might as well let corrosive bone break the seal.He wasn't afraid of that venerable sovereign, but Li Hao was even more difficult to deal with than Zheng Yu.Even now, Li Hao was at a disadvantage.At this moment, Li Hao disappeared again.The next second, when Li Hao appeared, li daoheng frowned slightly, his expression somewhat unsightly.Again?This damned new Dao universe ... Time and Stars. At this moment, he was somewhat disgusted and irritated. The power of time had become his greatest headache.Li Hao ... You still want to try again?It's not good for you every time you use it.At this moment, celestial pole's expression changed drastically.""Don't ... Don't come! My main body might be fighting ... Don't mess around. Emperor Cang just said that he was fighting. Everyone might be fighting ... It's fine if one of my avatars dies, but don't kill my main body!"艹!Yes, at this moment, Li Hao had appeared in front of him. Surrounded by the river of time, he knew what Li Hao was going to do!This was a scam!I knew it. Nothing good will come out of being entangled with these people.This is ... Going back to my past! 艹!My main body might still be fighting with someone right now. If Li Hao backtracked to my main body and extracted my power, what if I get killed?That was the main body!If the clone died, then so be it. They probably wouldn't dare to touch er Mao now, but I ... I have to save my life!Li daoheng's expression turned ugly,"you think everyone is Emperor Cang?" Emperor Cang is the master of the world, while celestial pole is just an ordinary venerable sovereign. If you summon his true body and borrow his power, he will die in battle ... Senior celestial pole, interrupt him!"If he really borrowed the power of heaven's Fate's true body, trouble would come!After all, he was a true venerable sovereign. Moreover, celestial pole was not the weakest venerable sovereign ...At this moment, he really hated the power of time.He, who was invincible, was intimidated by this power time and time again.It was clearly a battle in the world of Silver Moon, but now, Li Hao was using this power to continuously travel back in time, bringing too many variables to Silver Moon! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "Senior, you've misunderstood!" Li Hao chuckled. Heaven's Fate was stunned. A misunderstanding?Aren't you summoning my true body?In the next moment, the river of time rippled, and countless rivers appeared in the world. Many illusory figures walked out of the endless rivers.They were ... Li Haos!Li Hao smiled. He was extremely old and weak. "I'm thinking ... In the future, there will be countless of me. Every time I'm summoned, there will be a crisis ... If I'm summoned countless times, will there be countless crises? Anyway, I'm already at this stage, do I still care about the crisis? Senior, please help me stop him for a moment ..."Summoning the celestial pole?Given the celestial pole's fear of death, his original body was a venerable sovereign. If he was not willing to borrow power, it would be a waste of time and effort. This would require his original body's consent.Li Hao, why gamble on this opportunity?He might as well play with himself!In an instant, several future bodies appeared as if they had walked out from another time and space. Some of them were also covered in death Qi, some had powerful auras, and some had pale faces like the dead ...At this moment, these li Haos looked at Li Hao at the same time. The next moment, they sighed."Playing with fire ... Summoning the future so many times ... Even venerable sovereigns can't be saved ..."Li Hao hovered in the air and smiled brightly.""What are you afraid of? As long as I'm not killed instantly, I'll kill them before I die!"In an instant, several li Haos merged into Li Hao's body.A powerful aura, despite being extremely weak, instantly broke through the heavens and earth!Bone erosion Thearch turned around in shock!艹!This ... Was a venerable sovereign?Li Hao, on the other hand, was in excruciating pain. The time star in his body, on the other hand, quieted down. At this moment, Li Hao vaguely sensed that ... His death was coming!Continuously summoning the future ... Was not a bad method, but ... One had to pay a price to get a reward.His life seemed to have come to an end."Not only that, it's constantly breaking the order ..." He had a vague feeling that the chaotic lightning might be coming. The chaotic lightning before might not have been due to the fusion of reality and illusion, but ... The disaster brought about by the future self that he had summoned last time.He wasn't sure, but at this moment, he already had an answer!I ... Will die in this battle.A thousand swords appeared!At this moment, it was even developing towards an even stronger sword intent.As for li daoheng, he didn't say anything and didn't stop him. Instead, he escaped into the sky and went straight to Red Moon Emperor."Let's join hands!"Li daoheng shouted.At this moment, Li Hao was extremely powerful. Even though he was illusionary, he was still very powerful.This guy didn't want to live anymore.Even though Li Hao didn't have much of a chance to begin with.Behind him, Li Hao smiled radiantly. He was not in a hurry. He could feel that the chaotic Thunderbolt was probably really coming. There had only been nine bolts before, and there might be more this time!He wouldn't stop until he hacked himself to death!He looked up at the sky. As expected, the Stargate was shaking, and streams of chaotic energy were pouring in from the outside. It was unstoppable.Even the sealed Stargate could not block this aura.Dark clouds instantly covered the entire land of the Silver Moon!On the other side, Red Moon sovereign was having a splitting headache."Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!"Today was the second time he had seen the chaos lightning tribulation.This is troublesome!Li Hao was heaven's will, and the Silver Moon was enveloped by heaven's will. Just like before, they would probably have to experience a lightning tribulation.Li Hao's aura was wild and unbridled."Just come and play! Li daoheng, Shi Gu, come and play with me!"BOOM!In an instant, a Thunderbolt struck. This time, it was much more powerful than before. Li Hao's action seemed to have angered the chaotic Thunderbolt!BOOM!Three bolts of lightning fell on Li Hao, Shi Gu, and Li daoheng's heads!Heaven's Fate swallowed his saliva. What a powerful lightning bolt. It was several times stronger than the first time. If this continued, these guys ... Would all be finished!These people were all crazy!Why did it feel like none of them were normal?

Chapter 2477 The Catastrophe (1)
The primal Chaos lightning tribulation struck again.Li Hao smiled. He was very carefree. He had experienced this Thunderbolt before.Of course, experience was useless.The previous one was much weaker than the current one, but the second one turned Li Hao into ashes. If the power of time had not resurrected him, he would have died.But ... When he saw the two of them not far away, he was very happy.At this moment, the lightning came rapidly.There was no time to prepare.BOOM!The power of the attack was no less than that of a peak pseudo-Emperor.Li Hao was not the weakest among the three. Li Hao grunted as he withstood the powerful lightning.As for the other two ... Li daoheng let out a shout and shattered half of the Thunderbolts with his sword. Red Moon Emperor also punched the sky and actually scattered most of the Thunderbolts.It seemed that Li Hao had suffered the most.From this, it could be seen that the three people who were resisting the lightning this time were much stronger than before.The three of them were actually all infinitely close to venerable sovereigns. Li Hao's aura had reached venerable sovereign, but his strength was too superficial.Li daoheng might even be able to use this lightning to become a venerable sovereign.As for Red Moon sovereign, he had been trapped for too many years and had been worn down. In addition, two of his clones had been killed before ... He was indeed not much stronger than li daoheng.In short, the three of them were about the same. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt To say that he was at the venerable sovereign level ... Actually, he wasn't even at that level.However, Red Moon Emperor was a true venerable sovereign, and Li daoheng was only short of a Thunder tribulation. Li Hao devoured the future, and his aura was also that of a venerable sovereign.The three of them were at a very profound level.In the distance, li daoheng was extremely cold. He suddenly laughed."Many thanks!"What for?Although it was not a venerable sovereign's tribulation, the chaos lightning tribulation was more powerful. Although it did not give you any benefits, what he lacked was not benefits, but the kind of psychological leap.He believed that if he succeeded in this tribulation, he would become a venerable sovereign!Therefore, he had to thank Li Hao for giving him the opportunity to cross the psychological barrier and officially become a venerable sovereign.Li Hao smiled brightly.""You're welcome!"The first was the strength of a peak half-step sovereign.At least nine ... But was there really only nine this time?No one had ever experienced two chaos lightning tribulations in a day. The second time, it had obviously angered chaos. This time, it was not unusual for there to be 18 streaks, and it was normal for there to be 27 streaks. It would not end until Li Hao was completely killed.Thank you?Li daoheng, you're welcome. Perhaps only I know what I'm going to experience this time.On the other side, bone Emperor cursed.Unlucky!He had been sealed for a hundred thousand years and was often beaten up. Now, he had just come out, and he had to face an incomparably powerful Primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... Who the hell could he reason with?Am I an intruder?How could there be such a miserable invader?The moment he entered Silver Moon, Silver Moon had sealed him up. It was not easy for him to take advantage of the situation when others were fighting and he was not happy to be released ... And he was the one who broke the seal. In the blink of an eye, the primal Chaos lightning that was rarely seen in millions of years had come twice in a day!A small world ... Logically speaking, a venerable sovereign should be able to do whatever he wanted in a small world of such a level.But now ... Venerable sovereigns were here, and they could only be his grandchildren.BOOM!The second Thunderbolt descended instantly. This time, it was much stronger than the previous one. Li Hao still took it head-on. He didn't attack or defend, but took it with his body.In truth, he no longer had a physical body. The entire Silver Moon could be considered his physical body.The time star in his body was extremely quiet at this moment ... It seemed to be somewhat afraid of the chaotic lightning. The time star was also an invincible existence. However, it was frightened twice today.The first time was the appearance of Emperor Cang. This time ... The appearance of the primal Chaos lightning seemed to have frightened it. It felt a little different from the previous time. That time, even the ninth lightning bolt was just barely close to the power of a venerable sovereign. It was taken on by many half-step sovereigns.Even so, Red Moon Emperor's clone was almost killed.This time, it was only the second lightning bolt, but it was almost as powerful as the ninth. Li daoheng and bone erosion Emperor took the initiative to attack again.Seeing that Li Hao was only using his body to resist the attack, they were a little suspicious.Dark clouds gathered above the heads of the three experts.To the side, Heaven's Fate dodged quickly. Although Li Hao did not actively draw him in and would not cause him any harm, this Primal Chaos lightning still made him very afraid. This thing was too powerful.He was only a clone and was currently the weakest among them. If they attacked him a few times, his clone would be finished.He quickly ran to second cat's side. At this moment, second cat seemed to have woken up. It looked up at the sky and then at the celestial pole. It didn't seem familiar.The space that second cat lived in was a projected space.When it had died in battle, it had only met the human King and the others. It wasn't too familiar with the Crown Prince of the Western Emperor, celestial pole. However, it knew of the Western Emperor and could smell the aura of his bloodline.Second cat looked at the sky, then at the people there. It felt a familiar aura from Li Hao and knew that he had fed it and revived it."Meow ..."Second cat meowed and looked at the celestial pole curiously.At this moment, celestial pole could no longer be happy. He was a little worried and cursed in a low voice,""It's just a small world, and they're all ... Crazy! The human King and the others would never have thought that two chaotic Thunderbolts, time stars, and several venerable sovereigns would appear in this broken place ..."

Chapter 2478 The Catastrophe (2)
There were two uses for this world. The first was to resurrect the two cats. The second was to devour the world.Therefore, be it the human King or the blood Emperor ... None of them really took silver Moon seriously. It was a great fortune for a venerable sovereign to be born in this place. In the end, was it a venerable sovereign now?,m If Zheng Yu didn't die, who would've thought that this godforsaken place would give birth to venerable sovereigns like Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and Li Hao?If a small world the size of a fart could give birth to three venerable sovereigns ... Then they might as well split the neo martial world and give birth to hundreds of small worlds without a problem. Wouldn't that mean that they could give birth to thousands of venerable sovereigns?This Silvermoon world ... Really did have some opportunities.Not only that, at this moment, as the lightning struck, the level of the entire Silvermoon world seemed to be rising.The previous attack had already given him a feeling of improvement, and now it was even more obvious. The entire world seemed to be expanding, and the regional walls were expanding.The chaotic lightning had such an effect?……BOOM!The third Thunderbolt appeared. This time, li daoheng's expression changed, and so did corrosion bone Emperor 'S. Li Hao, however, was still smiling."Three Thunderbolts ... And it's already so powerful. How interesting!"Pfft!He spat out a mouthful of blood that was mixed with the power of time and chaos. The three bolts of lightning had actually injured him, a fake venerable sovereign, and it was not a light injury.The long sword in li daoheng's hand shattered instantly.Bone erosion Emperor's fist was scorched.The two of them were extremely solemn!At this moment, it was too late to do anything, because the lightning came too quickly, not giving anyone time to prepare.Emperor Shi Gu could not help but curse,""Li Hao, if you want to die, you can do it yourself! You can just drag li daoheng to hell with you! When I entered the Silver Moon world, I didn't do anything. I didn't kill a single person. You all killed yourselves! If you send me out of the Silver Moon now, I promise I won't come back ..."BOOM!The fourth Thunderbolt came, bang!A deafening sound resounded through the world. This attack made Li Hao and the other two vomit blood almost at the same time.The three experts who were infinitely close to the venerable sovereign level were hit by a Thunderbolt and spat out blood at the same time. Countless Red Moon Power on the body of the bone erosion venerable was scattered.The power of the three merged into the world of the Silver Moon.At this moment, the entire Silver Moon seemed to be evolving because of Zheng Yu's death, the descent of the two Dao universes, the descent of the primal Chaos lightning, and the overflowing power of the three people who were struck!The energy that the three of them dispersed and the blood that they spat out were all absorbed by the entire world.In the distance, the grey Mountain grew rapidly and expanded without limit.The forbidden Sea, which was almost destroyed, was expanding and rolling endlessly.The entire central mainland was also expanding and condensing.Li Hao's smile was still bright as he looked at bone corrosion Imperial Emperor.""Don't say that, venerable sovereign. It's only four Thunderbolts. I believe that if we succeed in this tribulation, we will all benefit. The level of the world seems to be rising. As the main contributors, we'll all get some benefits, even the inborn great Dao or the power of lightning ... In short, if we continue to resist, we'll definitely get some benefits!" 艹!Bone-corroding Emperor cursed!What does the advancement of the world's level have to do with me?He really felt that he was too unlucky. He hadn't felt this way before, but after breaking the seal, the first thing he had to do was to undergo tribulation ... He was on the verge of a mental breakdown.He had never been so unlucky!It was only the fourth bolt of lightning, and he was almost unable to withstand it.BOOM!The fifth Thunderbolt came. With a bang, Emperor Shi Gu was the first to be smashed into the ground. The ground cracked and instantly recovered. Emperor Shi Gu was smashed into the ground.As for Li Hao, he staggered and fell from the sky, his body covered in cracks.Li daoheng's sword intent soared to the sky, but it was directly dispersed by the lightning! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt At this moment, li daoheng's expression changed. Five Thunderbolts ... These five Thunderbolts ... Were even more difficult than the venerable sovereign's tribulation. If they were to go through the venerable sovereign's tribulation, they would be able to pass it with a hundred percent certainty.But now, there were only five bolts of chaos lightning, and even three of them had been injured by it!"Li daoheng, are you still going to thank me?" Li Hao was still as carefree as ever.Li daoheng was still cold,"why don't you thank me for a good thing?" After passing the ninth lightning tribulation, I will definitely become a venerable sovereign. At least ... I won't be the weakest venerable sovereign, and I won't be a trash venerable sovereign like Shi Gu!"On the ground, bone-eroding Thearch crawled out with an ugly expression.His words were crude, but his reasoning was not!Although these two fellows were not venerable sovereigns yet ... They were still some distance away from his peak. However, he was the first one to be smashed into the ground while the three of them were undergoing their tribulation. It was too embarrassing!Of course, Li Hao's strength was all fake.He didn't want to say anything about li daoheng failing to become a venerable sovereign.But ...He sneered in his heart.Yes, I'm not at my peak, but my body is a genuine venerable sovereign's body. At the very least, his recovery speed is faster than Li Hao and Li daoheng.This was the key!As long as he could endure it, he would definitely be the first to recover in the end, even though he seemed to be more seriously injured than them every time.……At this moment, everyone was watching the world-destroying Thunder!In the seven main cities, everyone was very uneasy.Li Hao's normal cultivation had provoked all the experts at once, and Zheng Yu, an invincible expert, had died in battle. Now, even venerable sovereigns were injured and vomiting blood. Such an unforeseen event was beyond everyone's expectations.

Chapter 2479 The Catastrophe (3)
Hong Yitang, on the other hand, did not say a word. Countless life auras surged into Lin Hongyu's body to suppress the death aura in her body. However, he kept frowning.The deathly aura was too dense!The Dali King had also received it ... But it was not his, so there was no problem now. However, Lin Hongyu received his future and was a dead person. Even if the power of a half-step sovereign had faded, the other party's body was still filled with a lifeless aura. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Whether he was Dead or Alive, even he himself could not judge.Lin Hongyu's star of the great path ... Was taken away by Li Hao. The moment Li Hao let her guide the future, he took away her Natal star. Hong Yitang wasn't sure if Lin Hongyu's Natal star was still there.Therefore, he was unable to determine if the person in front of him was alive or dead.Qian Wuliang, who was standing aside, wanted to get closer to take a look several times, but he was forced back by Hong Yitang's cold eyes. Qian Wuliang smiled flatteringly, indicating that he had no other thoughts.He was also very helpless!He had inherited the void Dao universe, and this was out of everyone's expectations. Now, not only Hong Yitang, even Zhang an, the Li Dynasty King, and the others were watching him in secret to prevent him from doing anything.'But ... Am I stupid?Qian Wuliang cursed in his heart,"Li Hao is still alive, and as long as this guy is alive ... Do I dare to do anything?"Take a look!Even venerable sovereigns had been taken away to cross the Tribulation. If they dared to act recklessly now, everyone would be shrouded by heaven's will. Even venerable sovereigns would not be able to survive this kind of lightning. As long as heaven's will covered them, they would be turned into ashes with one blow!At this moment, whoever dared to mess around would die without a doubt!In the entire Silvermoon world, only the celestial pole could withstand such lightning. Three strikes would kill it.Other than these three ... Who else would dare to cross such a tribulation?……The sixth Thunderbolt descended!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the heavens and the earth. The sixth lightning tribulation was unimaginably powerful. It was definitely as powerful as a venerable sovereign's attack, a true venerable sovereign's attack.Li Hao's body was turned into ashes by this attack.Within his body, a star appeared.Soon, the power of time was activated, and the extremely old Li Hao reappeared, but his aura was much weaker. He, a fake emperor, couldn't block this attack.Not far away, the stubborn li daoheng's flesh and blood disappeared in an instant. In the blink of an eye, his flesh and blood were restored. His bones and bones were flowing with countless sword intents. At this moment, these sword intents were also overflowing.Sword bone!Even Heaven's Fate, who was watching from the side, gasped. This li daoheng was also somewhat inconceivable. His bone armor had actually been refined into sword bones, which were even more powerful and terrifying than the White jade bones of a beginner martial expert!If this person was in new martial arts, he would have become an Emperor long ago.What a pity!Why did he have to fight for the small world here? otherwise, he could have become a top venerable sovereign.Of course, the chance was not too big. There were too many neo martial artists. Even if he was talented, his chance would be much smaller. Bone erosion Emperor was also crushed.He glanced at Li Hao, then at li daoheng, and cursed again. 艹!One of them had recovered his time power, and the other had an extremely powerful sword bone. Compared to them, he didn't seem to have much of a special feature. Although he was a venerable sovereign and his physical body was a little stronger ... It was only a little stronger, but he didn't have the uniqueness of the other two.It was really infuriating to compare!At this moment, he looked at the sky and the seventh lightning bolt that was brewing. He gritted his teeth and said,""The sixth one almost killed us. The seventh one ... Even the three of us can't handle it. Let's try to stop it together. Otherwise, we won't stand a chance. I suspect that the ninth one can kill a venerable sovereign!""Li Hao," he said angrily,"that cat, celestial pole, and the two masters of the great Dao can all bear some of the burden. Do you really want to die with us?"He suspected that he wouldn't be able to survive the ninth lightning tribulation!Now, it was better to split up.It was a good thing for him to have more people, even if they had to bear less."If you really can't do it, try ... Try to summon the cat's past again ..."Even though Emperor Cang was very terrifying!However ... If he summoned it, the other party could absorb some Primal Chaos lightning from a distance. Wouldn't that mean that he had passed the trial?One had to know that the other party had done it once before.The celestial pole had said it!Li Hao, however, said indifferently,"all of you must die!" If we die, the lightning will naturally be gone ... What's the rush?""Li Hao!""You!" Emperor Shi Gu was furious."Do you believe that I'm going to slaughter the entire continent now?""I don 't."Li Hao shook his head."The seventh Thunderbolt is coming soon. Very soon ...
