He smiled. Don't worry?For the time being, he was at ease.Besides, so what if he was worried?"Since you want to take a look ... Then let's go. Let's go together. I want to see how powerful the fifth rank venerable sovereign of The Dark World is."Kong Ji looked in that direction. It was the power of darkness.The great dark world!This macro world was actually not weak. In the past, it had even been enemies with the macro world he was in. The Master of Darkness was quite strong among the seventh-rank, but he was still killed by the neo martial human King. It could be seen how terrifying the human King was.Light and darkness seemed to always be enemies.However, to the current emptiness, was there any essential difference between light and darkness?Was the extreme of darkness light?Was the extreme of light darkness?With these thoughts in mind, Kong Ji and Li Hao walked toward the Huilong Grand Hall in the distance, one in front and one behind. Clearly, there were also people paying attention to them there. Vaguely, a few auras had been following and locking onto them. ……In the main hall, several experts were still conversing.At the entrance of the hall, two figures appeared. Dragon Emperor smiled and said,""Kong Ji and Hao Yue have come!"Although it was the first time he had seen Li Hao, he seemed to be very familiar with him.Smooth in all aspects!Even though a first level venerable sovereign was nothing to him, he did not hesitate at all. He walked down from his throne and smiled."I was just talking to Daoist Chao Han about it, and as we were talking, the two of you arrived. Haoyue, you don't have to be so formal. It's your good luck today. Daoist Chao Han has arrived at the Dragon-returning temple and is explaining the Dao of the macro world to us. It's a rare opportunity ... Experts of the macro world are rare for us. "Kong Ji laughed. It seemed like he was disdainful, but it also seemed like he wasn 't. That expression ... Seemed a little strange.As for Sui han, he raised his brows slightly but didn't say anything.The two venerable sovereigns in front of him ... One was at the fifth level, and the other was at the first level. Not to mention the fifth level, the first level venerable sovereign was not reserved at all in front of so many strong people. He sized him up from the moment he entered.This was very impolite!Pi han also did not say anything.After all, this was the territory of the return Dragon Emperor. It could only be said that this first stage venerable sovereign in front of him ... Was probably the first time he had met a middle stage venerable sovereign from a great world?Perhaps!That was the only explanation.Li Hao sized him up and made a mental note of him. Other than him, there were a few other venerable sovereigns present. They all had the same aura and should have come from the same great Dao universe.They all had some dark power.The power of an expert from a macro world was indeed purer than that of other venerable sovereigns. The other venerable sovereigns were more or less in a mess. This was caused by their straightaway cultivation of the chaos Dao.There were thousands of DAOs mixed together, but they were not organized. This caused him to absorb the power of many other great DAOs when he cultivated a certain Dao. Everyone knew the answer to this question.However, it was actually very difficult to solve. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  One had to have some understanding of the myriad DAOs. But if one had that ability ... Would they still be able to occupy this land and be King?"The great Dao universe is like a filter. It filters out the chaotic power of great DAOs and smoothens them out!"At this moment, Li Hao was deep in thought.After a clear comparison, he had some judgment. The existence of the great Dao universe was actually more or less the same. Silvermoon's great Dao universe was the same. It absorbed some chaotic energy and filtered it.Then, he would straighten out the power of the great DAOs and provide them for the people to cultivate.As the people cultivated, they would also give back to the great Dao universe, forming a cycle of power. While strengthening the great Dao universe, they could also absorb, swallow, and filter the chaotic power more quickly.Compared to these inferior venerable sovereigns, the powerhouses of the great world had one less filtering process.This was a good thing. It would be easier to cultivate.However ... If one really wanted to understand the essence of the 10000 DAOs, it might be more intuitive to directly absorb and release the chaotic force. Of course, this was unnecessary for most venerable sovereigns.Not everyone had to cultivate 10000 DAOs. Knowing 10000 DAOs was not as good as being a Dao spirit!Li Hao was still thinking when he heard mi Han's voice,""Little fellow Daoist, is there something on my face?"On the opposite side, Lai han seemed to be smiling yet not.Looking at Li Hao, he was actually a little angry.This person had been staring at him since he entered the room. At first, he was too lazy to pay attention to him, but even now, he was still staring at him as if he was a little distracted. Was he deliberately looking for trouble?Li Hao came to a realization. Seeing that everyone was looking at him, he slightly bowed apologetically. "I'm sorry, I was just thinking about something and got a little distracted. Senior, please don't misunderstand. ""Did you get distracted while thinking?""What's wrong? all the venerable sovereigns are here, and so is fellow Daoist Huilong. Is there anything more important than fellow Daoist Huilong's lecture?""You can't say that, maybe there's something ..." The Emperor laughed.Although he said that, Sui Han's words also had the intention of sowing discord.Of course, everyone knew.However, Li Hao had been staring at him the moment he arrived. Moreover, he was only a first level venerable sovereign, which made them somewhat angry."Seniors, please don't misunderstand me. I'm just a little curious ..." Li Hao said apologetically."What are you curious about?"Sui han continued to ask. Originally, he would have just given an excuse.But this person, if you insist on being curious, what are you curious about?"I'm afraid senior will be unhappy if I tell you,"Li Hao said after some thought.

Chapter 2651 The Two Fanatics
"Cough cough!""Daoist mi han, let's continue," the venerable Dragon Emperor coughed and said.As soon as Li Hao spoke, he was worried that he would cause trouble and interrupted him.However, mi Han's eyes narrowed slightly."Just say it. There's no hurry to discuss Dao. What's there to be surprised about, little fellow Daoist?"Li Hao pondered for a while and said seriously,"the great Dao universe of The Dark World has collapsed. Logically speaking, the venerable sovereign's Dao is within the great Dao universe. When the great Dao universe collapses, a venerable sovereign will either die directly or fall in level." As far as I know, venerable sovereigns can indeed take DAOs into their bodies and take away a part of the energy of the great Dao universe. However, without the source of the Dao, they are like rootless duckweed. How can they maintain their power without declining?"The other venerable sovereigns of The Dark World were a little angry.Sui han, on the other hand, was furious. A moment later, he frowned and glanced at Li Hao, but did not say anything.Even the Dragon Emperor, who was worried that he would anger Zhu Han, did not say anything.In fact ... He was also a little curious.The truth!After all, the fall of a great world and the collapse of a great path universe were rare.While mi han was still thinking, on the other side, Kong Ji laughed,""Haoyue, you didn't ask me about this before, otherwise I would have known a thing or two."Everyone looked at him.But Kong Ji didn't look at them. He looked at Li Hao and explained,""The great Dao universe has collapsed, and venerable sovereigns have absorbed DAOs into their bodies. Logically speaking, they should have declined or fallen ... But what you're talking about are all venerable sovereigns daosource!""Supreme Emperor Daoyuan?" Li Hao looked at him in confusion.Kong Ji nodded."Great DAOs have their origins. Under normal circumstances, only a portion of the venerable sovereigns in the great Dao universe are related to the origin of great DAOs!" For example, in the darkness great world, the darkness master was definitely a part of the origin of the great Dao. The other venerable emperors, some of whom were deeply trusted, would share the origin of the great Dao. These people would be more powerful and cultivate faster ... The darkness great Dao was the origin! The daosource can only accommodate a limited number of venerable sovereigns. These venerable sovereigns will fall with the collapse of the great Dao universe!""But some of the outer venerable sovereigns actually won 't. They're just a part of the Dao universe. Even if they take away a part of the Dao universe ... It doesn't matter. It won't affect the foundation of the Dao universe.""Yes," Kong Ji said seriously."Strictly speaking, they're only subordinate venerable sovereigns. They're not the direct descendants or core members!"Li Hao understood.So that was how it was!How much he gained, how much he paid.Therefore, the disappearance of the great Dao universe meant that the Dao source would collapse directly, and the venerable sovereigns who shared the Dao source would all die.On the other hand, outer venerable sovereigns like Min Han were not affected much.Even if the great Dao universe was gone, it wouldn't interfere with them.The absorbed energy would not retreat.However, it would be very difficult to advance in the future. At this moment, mi han and the others, including the Hui long Emperor, all looked at the void. This secret was not known by ordinary people, especially the Rogue cultivators. They were not involved in the great path universe and did not know anything about it.Even Li Hao, who was involved in the great Dao universe, wasn't very clear about it.As for the void ...At this moment, each of them had their own thoughts.As for mi han, he glanced at Kong Ji. Although he was explaining and telling the truth, he seemed to be belittling him, saying that he wasn't a core member of the great dark world.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Although it was the truth ... It was still a slap in the face to say so.He didn't give her any face!Lai han gave a faint smile."Daoist Kong Ji, you're not wrong. However, the land of Dao origin is only so big in a great Dao universe. There are only a few people who can share the Dao origin. It's not easy to occupy a place in the great Dao universe! Daoist forsaken desolation, you're quite knowledgeable. Could it be that you've occupied the core of the daosource in some great Dao universe?"Even if I'm not a core venerable sovereign of a great world, what about you?You haven't even entered the great Dao universe, right?Who are you mocking?Kong Ji glanced at him and smiled, but he didn't respond.It was as if he was too lazy to respond.Seeing that the atmosphere was a little stiff, Dragon Emperor immediately smiled and said,""My fellow Daoists, you are all very knowledgeable, but I am not. This is the first time I know that there is a Dao origin in the Dao universe!"Changing the topic, he quickly said,"Haoyue, it's your first time here, so listen more and speak less. Listen to the experiences of some of your seniors, it will be of great help to you in the future!""His smile was bright, and he was indeed a smooth talker. In the blink of an eye, he had changed the topic.By listening more and speaking less, he was also secretly warning Li Hao.It was his first time here, so he should speak less. It was best to shut up. We're all your seniors and are all stronger than you, so don't talk so much.Li Hao nodded and didn't say anything.Kong Ji, on the other hand, wasn't too interested. He didn't give them any face and said directly,""I'm not very interested in the Dao discussion. Senior long, since everyone is here today, I'll be direct. Have you located the whereabouts of the neo martial Swordmaster? When should he make a move? Who would make a move? In addition, if a high level venerable sovereign of a neo martial realm appears after the attack ... How should we deal with it?"He had no interest in those so-called Dao discussions at all. They were all bullsh * t. They were just praising each other, but it was useless and a waste of time.If Li Hao hadn't wanted to come, he wouldn't have even bothered to come.At this moment, he went straight to the point, because he knew that Li Hao was actually not interested in these people's Dao discussions ... Well, in fact, Li Hao was quite interested. Even if it was just nonsense, he could at least use it as a reference.

Chapter 2652 Two Fanatics (2 In 1)_6
However, Li Hao was also very interested in what Kong Ji said, so he didn't say anything.Huilong frowned slightly and disappeared in a flash.To him, it was very rude for the void to interrupt him. After the void had advanced to the 5th step, it had become more and more unbridled.This was not good!Today, the venerable sovereigns of The Dark World had just arrived. If he did this, he would not be giving him face.He suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart and quickly smiled.""Kong Ji, you're still the impatient one! There's no rush to deal with a top venerable sovereign!"Kong Ji spoke again."A person like the sword Saint doesn't have a fixed residence. His whereabouts are uncertain. He improves quickly. If we don't make a move quickly ... We won't have the chance."He was very serious,'the situation in the tianfang world is very complicated now! Let's end the battle quickly and be more straightforward. We can also take revenge for the few from The Dark World. Senior Dragon, you should directly make plans ... Give us a clear time and plan, including a comparison of strength, so that we can make some preparations. ""We'll only start at the last moment. There might be some mistakes."The venerable Dragon Emperor cursed in his heart.How could it be so easy to deal with a top venerable sovereign? wasn't he afraid that the news would spread out if he said it in front of so many people?This Kong Ji didn't give him any face today!Kong Ji saw that he didn't speak for a long time and didn't continue to ask. He roughly understood what he was thinking, but he only felt ... Boring!"Then let's not talk about it anymore. Senior long, it's been a hundred years since I returned to the Dragon Temple!" According to the time, I have a free chance to enter the dark Demon Ridge once every 100 years to comprehend the Dao of darkness!""However, I've already entered it once a hundred years ago, so I don't really need it. Can I pass this opportunity on to fellow Daoist Hao Yue?"“……”Everyone looked at him, a little unhappy.Was today the right time to talk about such things?Asking now ... It seemed like he was trying to force her to abdicate.If a fifth rank venerable sovereign brought this up in this situation, would venerable Emperor Hui long refuse or agree?If he rejected it, it meant that he was not giving a rank five venerable sovereign any face. The other party did not want it for free. He was just giving away his opportunity to someone else.However, if he agreed ... According to the rules, it was actually not allowed.According to the rules, Li Hao only needed to complete a mission once, and he would actually have a free chance. However, the desolation team had no intention of letting Li Hao complete the mission. They wanted to give up the chance.Venerable Dragon return Emperor frowned and ignored him. Instead, he looked at Li Hao.That expression ... Seemed to be saying, Haoyue, you reject it!He couldn't reject her directly!The others didn't dare to offend a level five venerable sovereign, so Li Hao could refuse without hurting their relationship.Li Hao's head was lowered at this moment. Soon, he felt a gaze on him. He looked up at the Hui long Emperor and then at Kong Ji."Then ... Thank you, Daoist Kong Ji. I'm really flattered!"Kong Ji smiled."It's a small matter. To me, I've already comprehended it once. There's no need to enter it again." "Moreover, this once-in-a-century free opportunity is my reward. It's useless to me, but it should still be of some use to you. You can say that I'm offering you a gift by borrowing flowers. I don't need to pay anything."At this moment, Supreme Emperor Hui long was really angry.This emptiness was a little unruly.This Haoyue ... What did he mean?The two of them were echoing each other. Did they think that I didn't exist?On the other side, mi han and the others were all smiling.How interesting.Were these two foolish and bold, or were they deliberately provoking him?Or perhaps ... He didn't understand these rules and things at all, so he was just a fool who cultivated hard?Since both of them had said so, at this moment, they had put the venerable Emperor of the returning dragon clan on fire.At this moment, if the venerable Dragon Emperor refused, the two of them would be completely embarrassed.But if he didn't refuse, it would seem like he was being threatened.,m Venerable sovereign Hui long was silent for a while. Soon, he had an idea. After all, Kong Ji was a fifth rank venerable sovereign. He coughed and smiled."Since Kong Ji said so, then I'll break the rules! It can also be considered a celebration for voidsolitude's advancement!"  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 "Of course, today is also a day of great joy ... It just so happens that a few fellow Daoists from The Dark World have joined our Hui long temple. How about this ... The six fellow Daoists from The Dark World and Haoyue can enter the dark Demon Ridge together and comprehend the Taoist connotation together!""It's said that the Taoist connotation of the Hui long temple was left behind by a rank eight venerable sovereign ... Although there aren't many Taoist connotations left now, it's still a rare treasure land!"He seemed to be smiling, but he cursed in his heart.I'll let you force the abdication!Alright, then I'll let you all go in together!Of the seven venerable sovereigns, the weakest one, Haoyue, can't even comprehend a fart. You can't even comprehend a fart, and you even wasted an opportunity.As for the few from The Dark World, apart from Min Han, the other five did not have such an opportunity.Of course, this time there were many people, and to compensate them, in the future, he would give them some opportunities to enter alone. As for this Haoyue ... Don't even think about it!Who was he trying to disgust?As soon as these words were said, even Kong Ji could not object or refute.As for Kong Ji ... He didn't have any intention of retorting.Was enlightenment a matter of having more people?The more people there were, the more powerful ones would be able to comprehend more Dao?Then let's just compete in strength!It didn't matter how many people there were. He didn't mind at all as long as Li Hao went in. As for how much he gained, that was Li Hao's business. If Li Hao couldn't sense anything, that was Li Hao's problem. It had nothing to do with him.

Chapter 2653 Two Fanatics (2 In 1)_7
To him, this opportunity was not important."Sure!" He nodded.The venerable Dragon Emperor was stunned. He smiled and said nothing.You said it yourself ... Then do as you wish.It was pretty good!Otherwise, it would have taken a lot of resources to activate the Taoist connotation when he entered the void at level five. But now, he had saved a lot."Then it's decided. Tomorrow, the seven of you will enter the dark Demon Ridge together!"After he said that, he looked at Xi han and signaled him with his eyes.Mi han was also an experienced man, he understood what the other party meant. He smiled and nodded,""Then, thank you, fellow Daoist Hui long!"Free entry once more ... It was pretty good.Joining the returning Dragon Temple had a lot to do with the dark Demon Ridge. To him, now that he didn't have the great Dao universe to rely on, if he could comprehend some darkness attribute great DAOs in the cultivation place of level eight venerable sovereigns, he might have the chance to enter level six.As for the seventh-rank ... He did not want to.Li Hao also expressed his thanks with a smile.""Many thanks, senior!"It was a good thing!Even if he didn't turn back time, the Taoist connotation still existed in the level eight Taoist connotation. Even if he just comprehended it, it would be a special experience for him.The strongest venerable sovereign he had ever seen was only at the seventh rank.The human ruler, Emperor Cang, the owner of fire element mountain, the owner of Coiling Dragon Well ...As for level eight venerable sovereigns, he had never seen one before.As for Kong Ji, there was no need to thank him anymore. If there was a chance in the future, he would repay him. To him, such an opportunity was not worth mentioning. The Dao of nothingness actually had some similarities with the dark element, and it was even more brilliant. The other party would not need this opportunity to comprehend.They were supposed to welcome the venerable sovereigns from The Dark World, but Li Hao and his partner had messed things up.Everyone's interest was dampened.He originally wanted to discuss Dao, but now he lost interest. When he returned to the Dragon Emperor, he saw Min Han's lack of interest, so he said directly,""Then make some preparations. We'll enter the dark Demon Ridge tomorrow. As for the Dao discussion ... We'll have plenty of opportunities in the future!"After he said that, he glanced at Li Hao and Kong Ji. These two bastards!Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed a little regretful.Are you not going to talk about Dao anymore? Although it's useless for Kong Ji to say it, I still want to hear it.Did we go a little too far?He glanced at Kong Ji and felt that it was Kong Ji who had gone too far. Why did he interrupt the discussion of the venerable sovereigns?Kong Ji looked back as if he knew what he was thinking. He smiled and sent a message,""There's no point in discussing Dao ... The opening of the dark Demon Ridge only allows those who are comprehending Dao to enter, and the Dao of darkness covers the world ... You can try it yourself tomorrow ... You won't find out your identity! What else was better than a direct fight? Of course, don't provoke the Tier 5 ones. The remaining five can be used as practice, but don't kill them, or else ... There will be some trouble!"Hearing this, Li Hao immediately understood."You're welcome!"Kong Ji laughed and thought that it was a small matter. It was equivalent to opening a private arena for you. It was a small matter and you didn't have to pay anyway.Li Hao, on the other hand, began to plan.There were five venerable sovereigns and several third-rank ones.He could use it to practice on the spot ... It was not a bad idea. He could try to see if he really had the ability to deal with a stage three after he entered stage two instead of just guessing and making wild guesses.He had never fought a Tier 3 martial artist one-on-one before. When he was dealing with the Crimson Moon expert, he had also surrounded and killed him.Moreover, they all borrowed strength from others.This time, perhaps he could try not to borrow external power, but to fight the other party one on one!At this moment, Li Hao smiled.It was a good opportunity!,m It would be even better if he had some gains in the dark path.The two of them looked at each other, smiled, and walked out together.The other venerable sovereigns glanced at the two of them and cursed in their hearts. What's going on with these two? they've been alone for a hundred years. Could they have hooked up with this newly-promoted venerable sovereign?That venerable Emperor Hao Yue ... He did look like a pretty boy. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Of course, this wasn't a rare occurrence.The chaos was vast, and there were all kinds of oddities. This was nothing.Haoyue was still a human.Some venerable sovereigns, who were not human, wanted to try it. The longer they lived, the more curious they were and the more interested they were. There was nothing strange about the difference between the empty and bright moon.At this moment, Li Hao was unaware of all this. If he had known ... He might have to consider whether he should borrow the power of an eighth-rank magical beast!

Chapter 2654 The Dark Demon Ridge (1)
He returned to the Dragon Temple and was about to open the dark Demon Ridge.At the same time.Red Moon region.Primal Chaos void.A white-haired old man was roaming in the void. A jade pendant on his body rippled, and a voice came from the jade pendant,""There's been some movement in the tianfang world. Many venerable sovereigns want to take your life." "Take my life?"The old man sneered."Then come!""Don't be careless!"The jade pendant's voice transmitted, and after a while, it said,""Silvermoon has opened a Stargate. The new king over there might be in the tianfang world now.""I know."The old man replied and continued to travel in the void. After a while, he said,""What's the new king's strength?""I'm not sure,""I want to make a trip to the Skylands world.""Now?""Yes,""You'd better not. ""Why not?" the old man's expression was calm. Since they want to kill me...Then I'll take the initiative to go over and let them kill me!""It's dangerous! "It's said that the recovery of a great Dao universe might appear in tianfang. Many great world experts in the nearby area are rushing over. If they encounter it in the chaos, they might have some confidence. If they go there and get trapped ... It'll be troublesome. "The old man fell silent.He was trapped.The tianfang world was a major world, after all. It couldn't be easily broken through. It only had four realm gates. Once the realm gates were blocked, many experts would seal the realm. It was indeed dangerous.It was unlike chaos, who could escape at will.The old man still wanted to go.But at this moment, the voice from the jade pendant came again,""I know you want to go over and you're not afraid of danger, but it's not your business now. If you're trapped in tianfang and Fang ping goes to look for you, he'll also be trapped there ... It's an unbearable loss for neo martial! Fang ping was outside now, creating a deterrence, but once he was trapped ... It was like a dragon trapped in shallow waters! Neo martial wants to break the stalemate and terrorize the universe. He can't be trapped. "Although the old man was used to being independent, he still agreed after a moment of silence.""Then let's do this! Then ... What's our goal this time?""Destroy a few great worlds!"The voice from the jade pendant was calm, as if annihilating the great world was not a big deal."We're going to give birth to a rank seven venerable sovereign in a great world! "The Crimson Moon isn't easy to deal with. Let's not rush into a fight for now. Let them continue to attract the power of the surrounding great worlds. It'll be best if the Crimson Moon can gather a large number of experts to weaken the other forces and give us a chance.""Alright, I know what to do," the old man said after some thought."Who will the path of Nirvana be given to?""We'll split it evenly! The path of Nirvana was not a good path. Let's split it evenly and increase the overall strength! Creating a batch of middle-stage venerable sovereigns to lay a good foundation. The path of darkness was actually not bad ... Unfortunately, the situation at that time did not allow him to take it away, so he could only destroy it! So, we're still in the Foundation Stage. " "Okay, I got it."The old man responded for a while and did not say anything else. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  The voice in the jade pendant also gradually died out.The old man looked in one direction for a while. Very quickly, he changed his direction and no longer headed in the direction of the sky. Since he could not go now, if he did, he might be surrounded and even cause Fang ping to be trapped. There was no need to take the risk.If he was alone, he wouldn't mind touching those guys who wanted to deal with him.Longevity swordsmen were never afraid of such things!However, I'm still a neo martial artist.……The Skylands world.Back to the Dragon Temple.The Abbey Dean of the Huilong temple was still thinking about the day's events. Suddenly, the mirror in front of him fluctuated. The Abbey Dean's expression froze and he quickly composed himself. He was extremely solemn."Sector Lord!"At this moment, an illusionary figure appeared on the mirror."Has the person from the ultimate darkness arrived?" a calm voice came from the mirror."We're here. ""All six venerable sovereigns have joined the Hui long temple," replied the venerable Emperor hurriedly."That's good. "The realm Lord nodded slightly, indicating that he was right. He then said,"The new king of the Silvermoon, the world of the Silvermoon, there are still no traces of it?""In the Silvermoon world, it seems that some of our tracks have been exposed. I'm having people track them! But ... The new king of the Silver Moon ..."Venerable Emperor Hui long hesitated and said,""I did suspect two of you before, but one of them is a female venerable sovereign. After some investigation, it's been confirmed that she's from the endless sky World. As for the other male venerable sovereign, I'm a little suspicious, but Kong Ji is his guarantor ...""Empty?""Yes, it's the one from a hundred years ago. I've always suspected that he's from the radiant world. He might even be the genius of the radiant world...But I'm not too sure. He's a rank five venerable sovereign, and he's the inheritor of the path of light. Now, he seems to be cultivating a path of darkness ... I'm not too sure. ""It's just that ... Today, when we were chatting, he mentioned something about the origin of the great Dao. I'm a little suspicious again. "Venerable Dragon Emperor didn't seem to be as incompetent as he appeared to be.At this moment, he was a little hesitant,"the target of suspicion is called Supreme Emperor Hao Yue, which is ... Somewhat similar to the Silver Moon world." That day, Kong Ji took the initiative to go see him. Afterwards, he promised that he was a good friend of his from many years ago, and that he came from the bright moon Small world. ""That's why I didn't beat the grass and alert the snake,""That's right," venerable Dragon Emperor added."Today, Kong Ji also fought for a chance to enter the dark Demon Ridge."In the mirror, the sector Lord was silent for a while.He seemed to be looking up information, but he also seemed to be muttering to himself.After a while, he said,"we're looking for the new king of the Silver Moon!" He also wanted to find the Silvermoon world! The Silver Moon and the yin-yang world were closely related! And the yin-yang world is extraordinary. That neo martial human King is about to enter the eighth level ... It's hard to imagine that he could enter the eighth level in a mere thousand years!"

2655 Chapter 441
"Although yin and yang are powerful, his Dao of yin and yang shouldn't have improved so quickly. He reached level eight in 1000 years. If he was given more time, perhaps ... The legend of Tian Fang will reappear. This region might give birth to another uncrowned King!""To us, a level nine venerable sovereign is enough to make any great world despair!"The realm Lord said a lot and finally said,""Empty, right? It doesn't matter whether he's the genius from the great light world or not. Since he wants to enter the dark Demon Ridge ... You can test him. ""I was thinking the same thing!"Dragon Emperor nodded. He agreed to it because he wanted to test the waters, but he was a little hesitant."Sector Lord, how do we determine if the other party is the new king of the Silver Moon?"No one knew anything about the new silver Moon King. They couldn't possibly assume that he was the Silver Moon King just because he was new, right?Didn't he have any special characteristics?If he admitted his mistake, wouldn't he have offended Kong Ji for no reason?"The new king of the Silver Moon ..."Characteristics?The sector Lord pondered for a while before saying,"he knows the sword Dao, and his sword Dao isn't weak!" That was the first reason. The second reason was that he could fight against upper-level cultivators. If he was a stage one cultivator, he could probably kill stage two cultivators ... Or even stage three cultivators! One of Hongyue's third level venerable sovereigns died. He might have been killed by the other party. "Venerable Emperor Hui long gasped.A rank one against a rank three?Terrifying!"Third, the other party is going all out. He might also have some aura of the great Dao universe ... Not the origin great Dao universe, but the aura of another great Dao universe!""Realm Lord, what do you mean?" the Emperor was stunned."The Silver Moon ... Might have given birth to a new great Dao universe.""Yes," the sector Lord said calmly."Silver Moon has a close relationship with neo martial arts and has great potential. He can quickly produce venerable sovereigns and open the sealed Stargate. In addition, the longevity sword had been in charge for many years, so ... There was still a possibility of the birth of a great path universe. And this is your chance! If a great Dao universe is really born, you'll have hope of reaching the seventh-rank. " "As for tianfang world's universe of the great path, let's not talk about whether it can recover or not. Even if it can ... There are too many people fighting for it, and even some Level 7s are eyeing it. Your chances are very small.""If that's the case, why don't you take advantage of the fact that others don't care? if Silvermoon really gives birth to a great Dao universe, it will be a rare opportunity for you!"The face of the Dragon returning Emperor changed slightly.Is that true?The Silver Moon could give birth to a new Dao universe?Of course, these words came from this incomparably powerful realm Lord.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  If it was anyone else who said this, he would only scoff at them. However, this realm Lord had so many of them ... The possibility was very high."Sector Lord, do you mean that if this Hao Yue is the true new king of Silvermoon, he might have grasped a Dao universe? this Dao universe should be a new universe, and if I can seize it ... I have a chance of reaching the seventh level?""That's right ... The premise is that you can nurture him. The Dao universe was just created and he isn't too strong. Of course, this is an opportunity! There are many venerable sovereigns gathered in Hui long temple. If they can all join this great path universe, the great path universe will mature quickly. It won't be difficult for you to reach Level Seven!"Seventh-rank!The strength of a major cosmos absolute being. Moreover, not all major cosmos absolute beings were at the seventh rank. Some of the weaker ones were only at the sixth rank.However, even if it was a sixth-tier, it was still much stronger than them, who were sixth-tier universe without the great Dao.As these thoughts surfaced in his mind, he could not help but ask again,""Then ... How do we determine if this person has mastered the great Dao universe?""The Silvermoon great Dao universe shouldn't be too powerful. If it really existed, it would definitely be controlled by this person. No one would give up on a great Dao universe! The dark Demon Ridge was a good place ... One could isolate the dark Demon Ridge when the other party was at their peak. If the other party's strength declined, it would mean that they had isolated the great Dao universe. If there are no changes ... It means there is no universe of the great path. "Then he might not be the new king of Silvermoon.This realm Lord had actually concluded that the Silver Moon might have given birth to a new Dao universe. Otherwise, the new silver Moon King would not have been able to corroborate his Dao and become a monarch so quickly, nor would he have been able to kill the red moon sovereign so quickly.The Dragon Emperor understood. In other words ... As long as the other party uses his full strength, and I isolate the dark Demon Ridge, his strength will decline, and we can determine his identity. ""Not bad."The realmlord said slowly,"if you can confirm his identity, take him down immediately!" There's no need to worry about Kong Ji. Even if it's the one from the great radiance world, there's nothing to worry about. If his father wants to interfere, I'll deal with him myself!"As soon as he said that, the Dragon Emperor was relieved.The great radiance world!It was not a weak world. The chaos was huge, and the nearby territories were all named after powerful worlds, such as the Crimson Moon region, the heavenly square region, and the ... Light region!Under normal circumstances, the overlords of these regions would have level eight venerable sovereigns.Of course, it was not a hundred percent.If it was a region, the strongest great world would only have a seventh rank venerable sovereign, and it was possible that a seventh rank venerable sovereign would be the Overlord.Although he was only suspicious of Kong Ji, there were a few times when he seemed to have sensed the aura of another expert. Although it was not obvious, he still maintained his suspicion.Of course, he didn't want to talk about things that he wasn't sure about."I understand, thank you for your support, realmlord!""There's no need for that. It's all your own credit .... In addition, continue to pay attention to Tian Fang! There are opportunities in Tian Fang, but there are also dangers. Everything is only on the surface, and the real things have yet to be dug out!"

Chapter 2656 The Dark Demon Ridge (3)
The realm Lord's voice was solemn."Level nine venerable sovereign, Dao master of space, Tian Fang. It's very likely that another world is hidden in Tian Fang ... I don't know if there's one, but Tian Fang definitely has more secrets!" Huilong, I hope you can bring me some surprises. ""I definitely won't let down the realm Lord!""Yes," replied the Emperor. The sector Lord also disappeared.The mirror returned to silence.Hui long di stood in silence for a while. The bright moon, the Silver Moon, the great Dao universe ... Was it really like this?He looked in the direction of the hall where Kong Ji was. At this moment, Supreme Emperor Hao Yue was there.After a long time, he slowly said,"men, bring the giant pincers to me!.""Yes, sir!"Very quickly, someone went to look for the giant pincers.Although he was curious as to why the venerable sovereign would summon a non-venerable sovereign, the giant pincer had to come no matter where he was since the venerable sovereign had spoken.……"The dark Dao of the dark Demon Ridge is quite interesting." At this moment, in the empty Hall."I've been there once a hundred years ago. There are still some DAOs left. The other party's Dao of darkness is a little special. It even includes many other DAOs of the same series. ""The owner of this place was the dark god envoy of the light and dark messengers of the tianfang world. He was called dark night Emperor!""According to some records, this person once destroyed a large world at his peak. He was extremely powerful and took lives in the dark. No one knew about it until the large world was destroyed. This shows how extraordinary he is!"Li Hao nodded. It was already very powerful to destroy a world.A level eight venerable sovereign ... One had to know that the only ones in the apocalypse World were the neo martial human King and the others. He had never heard of the others."The Dragon field isn't a simple place. There are many powerful figures from the Outlander world here.""Back to the Dragon field, the southern gateway to the Skylands ..." Kong Ji continued.Kong Ji thought for a while."Under normal circumstances, the strong cultivators of the macro worlds are evenly distributed in various places. However, tianfang's southern region has gathered a large number of strong cultivators. Other than the Coiling Dragon Well, Fire Mountain, and dark Demon Ridge, there are several other places with Taoist reserves. They may all be the cultivation places of high-level venerable sovereigns."Why were they all in the South?At this moment, Li Hao fell into deep thought."It's even said that ... The master of tianfang's place of cultivation is also in the South," Kong Ji continued."Of course, no one has discovered this place yet.""The South is facing the red moon region!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Kong Ji thought for a while."I'm not sure if it's related to the Crimson Moon region. Or is it related to neo martial?"It was clearly an era that had nothing to do with him. The tianfang world had existed for many years, and at that time, there were no new martial arts. Not to mention neo martial, even the era of the nine emperors and four Emperors was actually less than 200000 years.And that was relative to the Silver Moon. In reality, it was much shorter in the chaos.It was only about a hundred thousand years.And a hundred thousand years ago ... Even earlier, Tian Fang's powerhouses had all disappeared. The two sides had no relationship at all. It was unknown why Kong Ji felt that it was related to neo martial.Seeing Li Hao look over, Kong Ji smiled.""It's just a guess. Perhaps ... I've predicted the future?"He didn't say anything else. This was indeed a little uncertain.He continued,'let's not talk about other things, but the dark Demon Ridge is worth a visit! In addition, Huilong's performance today is a little off. When we enter the dark Demon Ridge tomorrow ... You have to be careful. Huilong has controlled the dark Demon Ridge for many years, and I'm afraid he wants to test you. ""Wrong?"Li Hao was puzzled. He wasn't familiar with this person.What's wrong?Kong Ji explained,"with his smooth personality, he has so many venerable sovereigns in the Dragon Temple. No matter what, when he knows you are here today, he will send a venerable sovereign to welcome you instead of ignoring you!" From the moment you entered the South realm gate, you should have known the Huilong temple's style. No matter whether it's useful or not, the Huilong temple will always maintain respect for any venerable sovereign!""He knew that you were coming and I'm behind him. A fifth level venerable sovereign even asked you to come back ... Even so, he sensed your return. Can't he even send a first level venerable sovereign to receive the few venerable sovereigns from The Dark World?"Li Hao's heart moved.This was also true!Huilong temple was really smooth and slick. This was his first time in tianfang world and he already felt that this sect was not bad. Why?It was because of the giant pincers.They were so enthusiastic when they met. He was a guide and gave Li Hao some treasures for free. Anyway, he was going back to Supreme Emperor Dragon today to receive several venerable sovereigns from The Dark World. He should not have ignored Li Hao.Previously, in order to receive the rank three Shenghong, the heavenly River Thearch had ignored Li Hao, which was actually normal.But today ... Li Hao had a level five venerable sovereign on his side.And the Dragon Emperor ignored him!This should not have happened!Kong Ji had been here for a hundred years, so he was at least more reliable than the venerable sovereigns of The Dark World.Li Hao thought, you mean, he did it on purpose? You knew that we would go?""It's possible. "Kong Ji nodded,'perhaps it's not me, but you. I'm testing you!' The people from The Dark World came on the same day as you. He could have changed the time, and the people from The Dark World could have joined at any time. Why did he have to come today? Your whereabouts are unknown, but the giant pincers ... There are still people who know where they are. "

2657 Chapter 441
"It's hard to hide anything from him in the Dragon field. ""The Dark World was just destroyed by the neo martial artists, so ... He should be suspicious of your identity."Are you doubting my identity?According to Kong Ji, this was a possibility."We'll just adapt to the situation!"Kong Ji didn't care too much and said, "Don't worry too much. Huilong is actually a very vigilant person. Without full confidence, he won't easily do anything to you. He has been able to stand here for so many years because of his vigilance. ""I understand. Thank you for your reminder, fellow Daoist.""I'm new here," Li Hao said with emotion."I'm not familiar with anything. It's a bit difficult to move forward!""It'll be fine in the future. "Kong Ji laughed."Don't worry too much. Just attack when you need to. There's no need to hide too much!" As long as you don't expose your identity as the Silver Moon King, I, a fifth level venerable sovereign, will still have some deterrence. Of course, if my identity is exposed, a fifth-rank would probably be useless. "As long as he didn't expose himself, he didn't think it was a big deal.Li Hao nodded and didn't say anything else.The two of them chatted for a while. Since Li Hao had to enter the dark Demon Ridge tomorrow, Kong Ji didn't continue the conversation and quickly left.Li Hao was left alone in the hall, deep in thought.……In the blink of an eye, the second day arrived.Early in the morning, many venerable sovereigns gathered.Back to the Dragon Hall.Without saying much, the venerable Dragon Emperor led the group of people to the back of the hall. As he walked, he said,""The Taoist connotation of the dark Demon Ridge is about to dissipate. Every time it's opened, it consumes a lot of energy!""This time, seven venerable sovereigns have entered, and the consumption is even greater ... I hope that all fellow Daoists will have some gains so that this trip will not be in vain!""For dark-type cultivators, this place is full of Taoist connotation and is shrouded in the light of great Dao. For you, it is an opportunity ... However, you must be careful.""When the Taoist connotation appeared, there was no difference between heaven and earth, no direction, and no aura in the entire Dark Demon Ridge ... At this time, the whole world seemed to be dark. Only sound existed in the darkness!""And sound ... Can't travel too far." "In the past, every time it opens, there will be some things that I don't want to see. Some people take advantage of the chaos to kill and steal treasures ... These are all taboo!"He warned,"fellow Daoists, you're all venerable sovereigns of the Hui long temple. Those who go in today are our own people. I hope that there won't be any disputes between you. You can all comprehend your own DAOs."Everyone felt strange.At this moment, some of the venerable sovereigns behind him glanced at Li Hao.This time, there were six venerable sovereigns from The Dark World and a foreign venerable sovereign.When they heard this, they all felt nervous for Li Hao.If something really happened, it would be Li Hao. The weakest venerable sovereign was at level two, but Li Hao was the only level one venerable sovereign.He was too weak!There were also people who looked at Kong Ji, who was as quiet as ever. He was extremely calm, as if he didn't hear anything.At this moment, Li Hao also smiled."Don't worry, senior. I'll behave myself after I enter!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Some people laughed in their hearts. 'Even if you don't know your place, it's useless.'You have to be careful. If the other venerable sovereigns don't like you and take advantage of the appearance of the Taoist connotation to attack you, you won't even know how you died.Soon, they arrived at a new hall.Hui long Emperor pointed at the only giant gate in the palace and said,""The entrance to the dark Demon Ridge is here! It involves some spatial teleportation. It looks like it's in our Dragon Temple, but in fact, it's an independent and closed small space!"He waved his hand, causing the massive gate to ripple.He continued,"I hope you'll all find something after going in. Also, this place can't be open forever ... It's best if you all come out within a month. It's also fine if you don't come out ... But if you don't come out, sometimes venerable sovereigns might go missing. This place isn't as safe as you think."Everyone was a little solemn."Missing?" that Lai han could not help asking."Right!""Yes," the Emperor nodded.Mi han glanced at Li Hao thoughtfully and said,""If they don't come out within a month, they'll go missing ... Does that mean that someone came out early, and it's hard to tell if the people behind them are really missing or dead?"The venerable Dragon Emperor didn't understand what he meant, so he nodded.""Yes, it's hard to judge.""Understood!"Mi han didn't say anything more. The other venerable sovereigns looked at Li Hao again.These words ... Did not have good intentions.They were a little suspicious. Did mi han want to deal with Supreme Emperor Hao Yue?Was there a need to?There was indeed some awkwardness between the two parties yesterday, but it was only a small conflict and not a big conflict. Was there a need to say this?Or was it just a threat?Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't seem to hear anything. He looked at the teleportation gate curiously.Teleportation gates were not rare.When one reached the peak of the Dao of space, one would more or less have some comprehension. They would be able to tear through space and travel through distance.However, at the level of venerable sovereigns, it had already reached the point of shattering space.The fact that the portal could still teleport them meant that it was extremely powerful and the space inside was absolutely stable. Otherwise, venerable sovereigns could easily break the space!It was highly likely that the portal was not made by the venerable Emperor, but had been there since the beginning.

2658 Chapter 441
It was said that the master of Tian Fang was a space Supreme Emperor.The core Dao of the tianfang world's great Dao universe, the Dao origin, was space.Therefore, the experts of this world should more or less have some comprehension of space.Of course, that was not the absolute truth."Everyone, in that case, let's all go in!"At this moment, venerable Dragon Emperor reminded him.He had said everything he needed to say. In fact, he was mainly talking to Li Hao.But this Haoyue, he didn't know if he was really stupid, or if he didn't understand, or if he was just pretending ... In any case, he didn't seem to have much of a reaction, as if he was playing the lute to a cow. He said this because he had some intention, that even if this Haoyue didn't look for trouble ... It would be best if Xiao Han looked for trouble.He was also able to determine whether this Hao Yue was the new king of Silvermoon or not.If so ... His opportunity would come.Out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at Kong Ji. Was this really the genius from the great world of light?One was a path of light, while the other was a path of darkness. Could they really be the same person?However, during that period, he had investigated and found out that only his Highness from the world of light had disappeared. It was said that he had done something that was against the world, causing the entire world of light to be in turmoil.Could it be ... That the connection with the great Dao of the macro world was cut off?He thought to himself, but he wouldn't show it.Seven venerable sovereigns, one level five, three level three, two level two, and one level one ... In fact, Li Hao was also a level two venerable sovereign.However, his aura was reserved in the river of life and death. Under normal circumstances, it would be difficult to sense.At this moment, the seven venerable sovereigns were gathered in front of the gate.Mi Han's face was calm and relaxed. He did not say anything and stepped in.He instantly disappeared into the door without a trace.The other venerable sovereigns looked at each other, stepped in easily, and disappeared one after another.Li Hao was the last to enter. He chuckled and looked a little silly as he followed them.After everyone had entered, venerable Dragon return waved his hand, and the fluctuations of the gate disappeared. The next moment, a large amount of venerable sovereign's blood essence was poured into the gate. He smiled and said,""I hope that this time, fellow Daoists will be able to gain something!"Then, he looked at Kong Ji."Kong Ji, the Taoist connotation is temporarily closed. You have just entered level five. Do you want to find a place to chat?""No need, I'm going into seclusion to stabilize my realm!"Kong Ji didn't hold back and disappeared into thin air.Huilong was not surprised. He had expected him to say this."Then the rest of you can leave!""I'll also go into seclusion for a few days. We'll discuss other things when they come out!"Hui long said with a smile.Everyone looked at the door again and saw that it was dim, so they didn't say anything.Venerable Emperor Hui long arranged for a venerable sovereign to guard the door and left.When someone came out, the door would naturally flash with light.……The world was spinning!The leap in space was like Crossing Worlds.At this moment, Li Hao sensed in silence. It was not the feeling of a Stargate opening, but a simple jump in space.At this moment, Li Hao knew that he was traveling through space.From the Dragon returning temple area, they entered the dark Demon Ridge area.The two sides were not in the same dimension.Instead, they were in different spaces.Was there a need for a great Dao of darkness expert to create an independent space to cultivate?One by one, doubts appeared in his mind.A moment later, his vision turned black.His feet were firmly planted on the ground, as if he had entered the dark Demon Ridge.After waiting for a while, Li Hao finally saw the scene clearly. As a venerable sovereign, he could only see a distance of about 100 meters, which was unbelievable.At his level, he could see through the world with a single glance!However, at this moment, he could only see through the scene within a hundred meters.The surroundings were pitch black.It was silent!Even the ground was dark, and the ground here contained a strong dark power. This place was indeed a treasure to dark-type cultivators.It was completely silent. On the ground, there seemed to be ... Some white bones?Someone had died in this place! In the distance, there was no movement at all. He didn't know if the six venerable sovereigns who had entered earlier were with him or had been teleported to different places.Even Li Hao didn't know how big the dark Demon Ridge was."Interesting!"Li Hao murmured in his heart. The fact that it could affect a venerable sovereign like this meant that this place had a strong Taoist connotation. The venerable sovereign of darkness had cultivated here for many years, and the Taoist connotation he left behind was still affecting this place.His eyes shot out a ray of light as he tried to look further, but he realized that he could not see through the black mist that filled the air.Li Hao tried again, and his eyes were filled with fear.One side was full of life, while the other side was lifeless.This time, he was able to see further. He could even vaguely see the scene five to six hundred meters away, but it was still too short.Li Hao made another attempt. An extremely weak time power entered his eyes. His eyes were a little illusionary. When he looked again ... This time, he could see even further. He could see a range of a thousand meters.At this moment, Li Hao discovered that he seemed to be at the edge of a mountain.Could the dark Demon Ridge be a mountain?Was he at the edge of a mountain?"The way of darkness ..."Li Hao actually had some understanding of the way of darkness, but he did not have a deep understanding.After some consideration, a piece of divine text appeared.​ The divine text was the way.At his level, he actually did not need divine runes, but he still managed to gather one. Li Hao's way of darkness was gathered from the river of life and death.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  A star was integrated into the divine text.Soon, the divine text took shape."Dark!"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat when the divine rune appeared. Suddenly, the divine rune began to absorb some of the surrounding dark power. Li Hao covered his body with the divine rune, and his aura disappeared instantly. At that moment, he could see even further!Even without Shi Guang, he could still see what was happening a thousand meters away."Interesting!"In this place, time and darkness had almost the same effect. They were more powerful than life and death.The venerable sovereigns of the darkest great world might not have been close to him."The path of divine runes, the path of darkness ... Absorbing darkness, strengthening the divine runes, and strengthening the power of darkness ... Not bad either!"The divine character "dark" instantly merged into the darkness, and some dark-type power began to gather around Li Hao.He started to move forward. It was said that the place with the densest Taoist connotation in the dark Demon Ridge was not here, but the central area.It was said that there was a Dark Shrine there.It was the place where the level eight dark venerable sovereign usually cultivated. It was the place where the true Taoist connotation gathered and the first choice for comprehending the path of a level eight venerable sovereign. However, most of the time, some people could not find that place at all.As for Kong Ji, he seemed to have been there once.It was likely that mi han and the others would also head there. As for dealing with Li Hao, or Li Hao dealing with them, it was actually secondary. The Taoist connotation of a level eight venerable sovereign was the greatest opportunity. Who would waste it?……Just as Li Hao moved.The dark dark Demon Ridge was like an erupting volcano. Wisps of black smoke rose from the mountain peak in the center and merged into the surroundings.The entire Dark Demon Ridge was extremely huge!At this moment, Li Hao's group wasn't the only one moving toward the central area. In the darkness, there seemed to be some other creatures that were silently moving in all directions.At the central mountain peak.The wellspring was filled with black smoke.A shrine that gave off a faint black light stood there. It seemed to have been there for a long time and was extremely stable.In the dark hall, there was nothing but a futon.The endless dark aura seemed to be overflowing from this praying mat. The source of darkness in the entire Dark Demon Ridge actually came from this praying mat. It was extremely terrifying.There seemed to be something hidden under the futon. It exuded a trace of light, but it quickly disappeared.For countless years, people had come to the darkness shrine and even seen this futon, but no one had ever been able to take it away. Many people had entered the darkness shrine and had never even seen a futon.……At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about that. He didn't move fast.A divine rune kept absorbing the dark power, and a star in the divine rune was also growing. Li Hao felt that the dark power here was extremely pure, and its level was even higher than the river of life and death that he currently controlled.He wasn't in a hurry, so he took it slow.At the very least, he would be able to gain some insight into the power of darkness. There did not seem to be anyone from Silvermoon who was skilled in the path of darkness. On the other hand, aunty radiance was skilled in the path of light and also cultivated darkness, though her level was not high.He would be able to share his insights with the two masters of the great Dao after he returned.

2659 Chapter 442
Dark Demon Ridge.Darkness enveloped the area.Back to the Dragon Temple.Back to the residence of the Supreme Emperor, who was said to be in seclusion, a disc appeared in front of him with seven light spots.Other than the light spots, there were also some black dots that were constantly flashing.It was obvious that the Emperor had a deeper understanding of the dark Demon Ridge than the outside world thought.These light spots had different glows.The strong and weak were all different.He couldn't see the details, but he could judge the strength of these people. This time, he mainly needed to judge whether Supreme Emperor Hao Yue could unleash his full power.Would the other party be extremely weakened if they sealed off the dark Demon Ridge?If such a change occurred, it meant that ... The other party was connected to the great Dao universe.It was that simple!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  As long as he could prove this ... So what if it was empty?This time, he would personally take down the bright moon sovereign, the Silver Moon King!The Emperor stared at them intently. Soon, he looked at the other black dots and frowned.The Taoist connotation wasn't dangerous for the other powerhouses of the tianfang world.Only this secret envoy, his Dark Demon Ridge, was filled with danger. Perhaps it had something to do with cultivating dark-type abilities. Others might not know about these black spots, but he knew what they were.These were the dark Yin swirls formed by the experts who had disappeared or the venerable sovereigns who had entered.It was only when he comprehended Dao in the dark Demon Ridge that he faced the danger of dying.It was very dangerous!These black spots and the dark Yin swirls would sometimes attack the cultivators who entered. Very few people could escape because some of these dark Yin swirls were very powerful. In one of his adventures, he even encountered a fifth-rank or even sixth-rank Dark Phoenix and almost lost.However, under normal circumstances, these Yin swirls would rarely be deployed.He only observed it for a moment and didn't pay too much attention to it.At this moment, he looked at one of the seven spots of light and raised his eyebrows.""2nd rank?"Was this venerable sovereign Hao Yue a second level venerable sovereign or a first level venerable sovereign?From what he could see, it seemed to be a first stage venerable sovereign.However, from the strength he had detected, it seemed to be a second stage venerable sovereign, not weaker than the other two.If it was rank one, then there was a high chance it was the Silver Moon King.However, if it was Tier 2 ... How long had it been since he came out of Silver Moon?He's already at the second rank?Was that even possible?At this moment, he was also a little confused.Perhaps, he had made a mistake in his judgment.……Dark Demon Ridge.Li Hao frowned slightly. There was no life to speak of in this place, but ... There was a vague sense of prying. He didn't notice that someone was spying on him, but Li Hao was quite sensitive. He had experienced that feeling before.Later, he found out that it was a spy from the red moon.Someone is monitoring me?It didn't look like it.That was a large-scale investigation?Who knows?At this moment, Li Hao continued to absorb the power of darkness. At the same time, he began to study the space around him. Yes, he wasn't in a hurry to do anything, nor was he in a hurry to deal with anyone ... Those were all secondary.He was studying how this place formed its own space.This kind of small space created by an expert was actually worth studying, because this kind of small space was more intuitive.And one more thing ... If he could figure something out, he could walk out at will instead of going through the gate of the Dragon returning temple.Otherwise, once the door was sealed, wouldn't he be unable to leave?"Back then, in order to resurrect the two cats, the blood Emperor also created a small space at the center of the eight continents ...""Senior ermao, Do You Know the Way of space?" Li Hao asked.“……”Second cat, who was deep in his sleep, was getting impatient. He pretended not to hear and turned over to continue sleeping.I won't listen, I won't listen, I'll chant Scriptures like a bastard!This Li Hao had too many questions. He was unlike the teachers, who didn't need to ask anything and knew everything. He could only ask the teachers, and the teachers would ask him almost no questions. How comfortable was that?"Senior ...""Hu hu hu!"In the river of life and death, snores sounded.It was as if she was telling Li Hao that she was asleep and that he shouldn't be disturbed.I'm just a cat, and a projection cat at that. How would I know anything?The huge cat's butt faced Li Hao as if it was saying,"ask again and I'll kill you with a fart!"Li Hao was also helpless.I'm just asking, why are you doing this?Can't we have a proper exchange?She was really ... A disobedient cat."My Heibao is still the best. Too bad he's a little weak. I do miss him. He can do anything but talk."However, it was often the predecessors who planted the tree and the descendants enjoyed the shade."Take the black Panther for example. If one day, he becomes a top-tier expert and I disappear, the Black Panther will also be a top-tier expert in the eyes of his descendants. He will be a top-tier senior who knows everything and is omnipotent.It was a pity that the strong kept pets, but often only benefited the younger generation, and they could not enjoy this kind of fun.It was normal.If he had trained hard and comprehended hard, he would have been easily caught up by his pet. Such an expert ... Could not be considered an expert. Even if the Black Panther had taken over the body of a Chaos Beast, he was only a second level venerable sovereign, the same level as Li Hao.But in the future ... Li Hao believed that it wouldn't be long before he surpassed Black Panther.With more than 240 bridges of life and death, he should be able to step into Tier 3, which was not too far away.
