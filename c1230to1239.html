        tary of the inspection Division asked. Was it the seventh Bureau or Li Hao's group?
         "Guess?" the old man chuckled.
         "I'm not interested in guessing!"
         The chief patrol officer looked at the screen and shook his head,"forget it, just as you said ... Let's lay low for a while. We can't afford to offend them, they've all gone crazy."
         There were more divine power realm cultivators than cabbages in the market. It was safer for him to stay at home since he had yet to completely stabilize his divine power.
         The old Secretary also nodded. It was better for us father and son to keep a low profile so that we don't become targets.
         Among the nine divisions, they were the only ones who had not expressed their opinions.
         The financial division had suffered a loss, and Li Hao was one of them. It was very dangerous for him to appear now.
         ……
         The north gate.
          Li Hao still didn't move. Even though the battle around him had already begun, and Nan Quan, hou Xiaochen, Yu Luosha, and Qin Lian had all attacked, and even black Panther had charged forward with a roar, Li Hao still didn't make a move.
         He wasn't trying to act cool, he was just waiting.
         Wait for someone to come!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The starry sky sword in his hand trembled slightly. He had cultivated the sword nurturing technique for a long time, but it didn't have much effect. The fusion of the five Forces might be his last strike as a Martial Master!
         The inner strength ... Had all been absorbed. Only a little remained in the sword, some of the last traces.
         Once this sword was released, he would no longer be a Martial Master.
         Perhaps his heart was still there, but his strength was no longer.
         He looked at the few divine arts, looked at them, and said softly,""No one came to kill me?"
         The starry sky sword seemed to be jumping for joy, cheering, and waiting.
         None of you are coming?
         "Do we need to do anything to kill you?"
         "Take him down!" Hu Xiao laughed and looked at Huang Long.
         Huang Long was stunned!
         Why?
         You're all here, why don't you attack?
         Hu Xiao didn't say anything. It was time to test Huang Long and cut him off from the inspection Office. Also, it was time to test Li Hao and see if he had any more trump cards.
         Origin talisman?
         Or something else?
         Whether Huang Long died or not ... It didn't matter.
         Huang Long cursed in his heart. Glancing at the people beside him, he gritted his teeth and sent a voice transmission, "Let's attack together. He has undergone a transformation before, so he still has the strength!"
         This old man clearly wanted him to show his loyalty.
         艹!
         He cursed in his heart. The next moment, Hu Xiao's voice rang in his ears,""Don't worry too much. If you succeed this time ... We'll take care of what you need to level up your divine ability!"
         Huang Long's eyes lit up!
         The next moment, he roared and threw a punch at Li Hao. What could Li Hao Do under the watch of a divine power?
         As for the others, they seemed to have received some kind of promise as they all made their moves!  Not far away, the big-eyed man and the others were wavering. They wanted to make a move ... But in the end, they stopped. They were simply courting death.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned.
         Huang Long and the others were just small fries that could be taken care of at any time. Killing Huang Long was not a bad idea, but it was not the result he wanted.
         As a Martial Master, he wanted to leave his last sword to the divine Art.
         What a pity!
         Li Hao sighed, feeling a little regretful. This was perhaps the greatest regret of his life as a Martial Master. He couldn't kill a divine-power realm expert with his own path as a Martial Master.
         "Cut me off."
         He shouted softly. His voice was not loud, but it seemed to reverberate through the hearts of the people, the heavens and the earth, and the surroundings.
         One sword!
         At this moment, all of Li Hao's remaining inner strength was infused into the small sword. With this move, he was no longer a Martial Master.
         Be it the divine intent or the sword intent, they would only be supplementary in the future. They would only be able to protect the five internal organs. The five Forces would also be completely extinguished and restrained in the five internal organs. Even if they were to explode, they would not have much power, as there would be no inner strength to support them.
         The Tiger roared and the mountain shook!
         They seemed to have realized that after this, perhaps ... They would be trapped in the five viscera lock for the rest of their lives. What's more, Li Hao wouldn't be able to recover, and the five viscera lock would break sooner or later. They ... Would die completely.
         "Roar!"
         The roar of the Tiger could cause the mountains to collapse and the earth to crack!
         This sword was too fast. As the sword fell, it cut through the void. The expressions of the few magical realm experts changed slightly, and they quickly took a step back!
         Kachaa!
         It was as if the void had shattered.
         Li Hao put away his sword. The small sword seemed to have lost its luster.
         Huang Long, Qi Zhao, Deputy Minister Zhou, and the other three deputy ministers all stopped in front of Li Hao.
         Out of the six powerhouses, two had undergone metamorphosis and four were at the peak of rising light.
         At this moment, they all stopped.
         Huang Long was at the forefront. Suddenly, he forcefully turned his head to look at Hu Xiao, as if he was asking ... Why ... Didn't you save me?
         Hu Xiao's expression was grave as he said softly,""Is this your trump card? Do you want to kill a god art to be buried with you? Li Hao, you're too unexpected!"
         BOOM!
          The six of them instantly exploded!
         This scene silenced everyone for a moment. Even the experts who were fighting were stunned and looked at Li Hao. Six experts, two of whom were at the transformation stage, had been killed by Li Hao with one strike!
         "Alright!"
         It was unknown where it came from, but a tsunami of cheers suddenly came. The next moment, it disappeared in an instant. The people in the city saw this scene and couldn't help but shout out in shock.
         However, he quickly realized that something was wrong and immediately shut up.
         Li Hao gasped for breath and shook his head slightly. Looking at the six people who had exploded, he smiled. "It's too F * cking ... Wasteful!"
         He had killed six powerhouses with a single sword strike, but he was not happy about it.
         He really didn't think much of Huang Long.
         It was a pity that the few magical powers didn't come.
         As for the people around him, their expressions kept changing. What a powerful sword!
        
         However, everyone also noticed that something was wrong. This sword attack should have been Li Hao's all-out attack. His inner strength and momentum seemed to have been extinguished after this attack!
         This ... Wouldn't li Hao have used up all his resources?
         At that moment, hou Xiaochen's expression changed slightly. Without thinking about anything else, he pushed his aura to its limits and thrust his spear out. With a loud boom, the general from the military law Department was sent flying!
         "Count me in!"
         In an instant, another Divine Art was used. The Deputy Secretary of the Internal Affairs Department rushed over, and two great divine arts were used at the same time.
         As for Nan Quan, Yu Luosha, and the others, they were being held back by those in the metamorphosis stage.
         Hu Xiao didn't say anything else. It was enough at this point.
         He had probed out everything he needed to.
         It was time for Li Hao to die. Let the farce end.
         A ruler appeared and was swung at Li Hao. This swing seemed to have confined the world and the surroundings as it went straight for Li Hao.
          Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows and looked in a direction.
         Without a word, a person stepped into the city.
         A punch was thrown!
         This punch simply shocked everyone. Even fist of the South was stunned. In the distance, Fist of the North also hurriedly looked over.
         BOOM!
         The ruler was smashed into pieces, and a powerful origin god weapon instantly disintegrated.
         Yao si silently walked over and looked at Hu Xiao.
         Then, he looked at Li Hao and smiled.""You said I'm disgusting?"
         He bared his teeth."You weren't even born when I was conquering the world! You're calling me disgusting?"
         He looked at Hu Xiao, who had an ugly expression on his face, and pointed at him.""You said that this old thing is disgusting, I have no objections, but you said that I'm disgusting?"
         He seemed to mind what she said.
         He was really unhappy. At this moment, his qi and blood shook the heavens and earth. He laughed coldly,""Do you think it's your place to interfere in the matters of the night patrollers? It's not your turn to interfere! Do you have me, Yao si, in your eyes? Huang Long, that trash, that dog, couldn't be bothered with him. He was jumping around, but unfortunately, he died too quickly. Otherwise ... He would have let him know. Not everyone can interfere with the night patrolman!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he threw a punch, and a giant dragon roared out!
         "Kill!"
         BOOM!
         Their qi and blood shook the heavens and earth. Yao SI's face flushed red while Hu Xiao's expression also changed. With a palm strike, chains seemed to have appeared in the air and enveloped towards him.
         "Yao si, you're still not giving up!"
         "Bullshit! You're the one who should die!"
         BOOM!
         The sound reverberated, and all the nearby houses collapsed in an instant. Fortunately, Li Hao had informed them yesterday, so no one dared to stay here.
         Yao si chose to attack!
         Not only that, Yao si even angrily shouted,""Night patrolman, listen to me! Kill them all and exterminate the rebels!"
         Following Yao SI's action, not far away, the eyes of a few deputy ministers and a few people with big eyes lit up.
         Yao Si was here!  This old Minister had been frighteningly quiet for the past five years. Everyone thought that he had gone completely dormant, but unexpectedly ... He actually made a move today. Even though there was now another divine-tier, it felt ... Like he still couldn't win. It was better than before.
         Moreover, he was able to stop the strongest, Hu Xiao, in one move, which was even more shocking.
         These old secretaries were not weak.
         On the ground, Li Hao was a little surprised. He suddenly laughed.
         He then looked around and suddenly felt that ... It was actually not bad.
         It's good that everyone is here!
         It didn't seem that scary.
         Hou Xiaochen was also furiously roaring as he suppressed the two of them. The two of them were constantly being forced back, and their battle prowess was unparalleled.
         The expressions of the remaining two magical powers changed. Without any hesitation, they charged at Li Hao.
         One of them was the Minister of the myriad demon Hall of the Department of rites, and the other was the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Commerce.
         The two of them also had divine powers. At this moment, they didn't care about the others. What they needed to do was kill Li Hao!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com On the other side, the man with the gun in the group of three suddenly shouted,""Kill!"
         A spear shot out!
         A Mantis trying to stop a chariot!
         But at this moment, he still made a move. He couldn't hold back anymore. Moreover, Yao si had already appeared. As long as Li Hao didn't die, this battle might attract even more experts to help.
         There would always be people who would feel unfair!
         "Old spear!"
         The big-eyed man shouted and cursed. In the next second, his eyes also turned blood-red, and a faint wave of divine power spread out. The area around Li Hao seemed to have turned into nothingness and disappeared.
         The man with the long blade followed up with a slash at the two divine arts Masters. He cursed in a low voice,"how crazy!"
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about any of this.
         The silver armor on his body also suddenly disappeared.
         At this point, those who should come out had come out, and those who should take action had taken action. He didn't think too much. The silver flames disappeared, and Li Hao looked at the sky. Suddenly, dark clouds covered the sky, and lightning flashed.
          In the next second, a strong wind rose. BOOM!
         ,m Lightning burst!  It was as if it was going to rain. A hurricane swept over, stirring up countless grains of sand. At this moment, even the projection could not be seen clearly. Everyone in the city felt their vision turn black.
         The two god art users were still angry for these guys who were like mantises trying to stop a chariot.
         They suddenly raised their heads!
         In the void, a bolt of purple lightning appeared, and the two's expressions changed. Divine power?
         Where did this divine power come from?
         There's more?
         Just as the two of them had such doubts, Li Hao disappeared. He disappeared, and no one even noticed that he had disappeared. Wind and thunder mixed, and the surroundings fell into darkness, with only lightning flashing in the void.
         The two divine power realm cultivators who had yet to stabilize their realms were on high alert.
        
         In the next second, the expression of Hu Xiao, who was currently fighting with Yao si, suddenly changed. Just as he was about to shout out, his heart suddenly palpitated!
         BOOM!
         The Thunderbolts exploded deafeningly, and the entire city seemed to have exploded!
         "Hu Xiao, the old Secretary of the criminal Division, made the new law. However, he violated the law and should be punished!"
         A cold voice resounded through the world.
         "The wind and lightning have descended upon you, so you must receive the punishment of the lightning baptism!"
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         In an instant, it was as if tens of thousands of lightning bolts had struck down. At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly appeared in the city. One by one, the secretaries and old secretaries rose into the air!
         The next moment, their expressions changed.
         In the distance, Yuan Shuo, who was still jumping and cursing, suddenly froze. He was sent flying by King Chujiang's palm and kept spitting out blood. However, it was as if he didn't feel anything as he widened his eyes and looked behind him!
          "Superpowers ..."
         He mumbled, superpower ...
         My disciple is a superhuman?
         How did my disciple become a superhuman?
         In all directions, everyone suddenly stopped fighting and looked through the lightning. At this moment, they saw a giant that looked like a god of Thunder.
         Li Hao didn't use his sword.
         He wore the wind-chasing boots and instantly stepped through the void. It was as if he had teleported and appeared in front of Hu Xiao in an instant. He didn't even care about the two strong men with the ability of God, but went straight for Hu Xiao.
         He appeared in an instant.
         Without saying anything more, a giant Lightning Fist appeared and struck out. Hu Xiao, who was fighting with Yao si, roared and a flame burned the world. However, he was destroyed by the punch!
         The lightning exploded!
         Li Hao's arm seemed to have turned into an iron hoop as it smoothly wrapped around his neck. BOOM! Flames erupted, and the next moment, the huge mountain exploded. He could use both earth and fire, stabilizing his realm.
         The two waves of energy exploded on Li Hao's body, causing his skin to split open.
         But Li Hao was still indifferent.
         Was it scary to be injured?
         It wasn't scary at all!
         Creak!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He wrapped his arms around his opponent's neck and punched. BOOM!
         The earth armor shattered!
         Another punch!
         Then, another punch!
         In an instant, it was as if he had thrown a million punches.
         Hu Xiao spat out blood and shouted,""Li Hao!"
         In the distance, within the city, a middle-aged man quickly broke through the air and shouted angrily,""Li Hao, you dare!"
         BOOM!
         Thunder exploded again. Li Hao's arm, which was wrapped around Hu Xiao's neck, grabbed his neck and lifted him up.
         "Today, I will kill one of the founders of the nine divisions, Hu Xiao of the criminal Division!"
         A cold shout resounded in all directions.
         In the next moment, he threw a punch at his opponent's face!
         Countless mysterious energy burst out. Hu Xiao kept roaring. His internal organs were being crushed, but he still couldn't block the punch.
         All the defensive powers on his face were shattered.
         BOOM!
         His head exploded!
         Li Hao casually threw the headless corpse into the air. The next moment, he disappeared as if he had teleported. With a flash of lightning, he was gone in the blink of an eye.
         Before the crowd could react, the expression of the old Duke, who was suppressing the Thunderbolt kick, suddenly changed.
         How could this be!
         Just as he had such a thought, a person appeared before him.
         Li Hao seemed to have stepped through the void and appeared.
         He didn't say much because Thunderbolt kick was relatively weak. At this moment, he was almost killed. He was the first one to come here. Without saying anything, he just punched out, and then another punch!
         The wind Lightning Fist was too fast!
         Not only that, but all the mysterious energy in the surroundings seemed to have been destroyed in an instant. Li Hao was too fast. Li Hao had the wind and thunder attribute, and the wind attribute meant speed, not to mention that he had the wind chasing boots.
         In an instant, the old Duke continuously blocked the attacks, blending water and fire together.
         However, even Hu Xiao couldn't stop him, let alone him.
         He punched over a hundred times in a row!
         BOOM!
         With a huge hole in his chest, the old Duke looked at Li Hao in disbelief. His internal organs had been completely destroyed."You ... Divine-tier ..."
         Are you not a Martial Master?
         "Thank you for letting me see through many things!"
         Li Hao smiled and crushed his head with a crack.
         The body was thrown into the river.
         In an instant, he disappeared again.
         "Quick, surround him and kill him!" Someone roared in the distance.
          BOOM!  In the city, several powerful divine-tier elites instantly charged toward Li Hao. Li Hao had become a divine power!
         ……
         As for Li Hao, he wandered in the hurricane and disappeared with the wind.
         When he reappeared, he was already in front of the two magical powers who were trying to escape. The two magical powers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Commerce wanted to escape, but one of them was knocked down by Yao si with a punch.
         Just as Yao Si was about to throw another punch, he couldn't help but curse!
         A giant foot as large as a mountain instantly descended. With a boom, it stomped on the God art expert who had been shot down, crushing him into pieces!
         Everyone was shocked!
         Li Hao had attained the divine power realm, his realm was extremely stable, his body was strong, and he had the wind-chasing boots, which made him extremely fast!
         This scene shocked everyone.
         However, the next moment, everyone was relieved.
         Not long after, several figures appeared beside Li Hao. They were all white-haired old men, and they all looked at Li Hao in disbelief.
         "You broke the SuperLock?"
         One of them looked at Li Hao in shock.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He just disappeared in an instant. BOOM!
         After exchanging a punch with another person, both parties took a step back, but Li Hao disappeared again. Boom boom boom!
         The sound of explosions continued!
         Li Hao's voice was cold,"all Silver Moon martial masters, unseal your combat strength to the maximum!" Kill them all. I'll have time to help you suppress them!"
         Just as he finished speaking.
         The next moment, the first one to unseal was none other than Yao si. Yao si instantly broke all the seals on his body, leaving only a trace of them. He then threw a punch. BOOM!
         With a loud bang, the magical expert from the Department of Commerce who was trying to escape was pierced through by him!
         "Why didn't you say so earlier?" he cursed in a low voice.
         Cool!
         Hou Xiaochen was also extremely shocked and shocked, as well as a bit angry and regretful. He suddenly roared, and his aura rose again, somewhat crazy and somewhat angry!
         "Dammit! You guys have ruined him!"
         "Cough, cough, cough ..."
         A violent coughing sound covered everything. A long spear split the void. He was angry, regretful, and wanted to kill!
         BOOM!
         The long spear split the soul. The Marshal of the military law Department was instantly pierced through the head by this spear. He was unwilling to accept this and could not believe it.
         Hou Xiaochen was furious!
         He raised his gun and charged at the second person."You'll suffer Silver moon's revenge, and he'll take revenge until you die! You'll face the revenge of all the martial masters in Silvermoon, the revenge of all their hidden forces. You'll destroy the geniuses of this generation!"
         The spear once again split the air, and flames even burst out of hou Xiaochen's body. He didn't care about any of this anymore. The eight great families "successors had been destroyed by you!
         BOOM!
         A long spear that seemed to come from ancient times tore another divine-tier apart!
         "Yao si, your choice is correct!"
         "They ... Will die!"
         Hou Xiaochen coldly looked at the people surrounding Li Hao, then suddenly turned around and charged toward the ocean. The southern Fist gang quickly followed. Yao SI's expression slightly changed as Li Hao's voice came,"Minister Yao, leave everyone here. Here ... These old pieces of trash. It's not that easy to kill me!"
         Yao si didn't say anything more and instantly pierced through the void.
         BOOM!
         The battle on the sea instantly became intense.
         The expressions of the old secretaries surrounding Li Hao changed slightly. Li Hao was too fast!
         They didn't expect Li Hao to be so powerful.
         The key was still speed. They couldn't catch up to Li Hao.
         BOOM!
         A bolt of lightning shuttled back and forth around them, again and again, and the sound of explosions resounded through the world.
         In the distance, two people appeared.
         The inspector's face changed and he roared,""The three major Darksider organizations dare to invade Heavenly Star!"
         BOOM!
         He threw a punch out of the city. His old father also shouted,""Today, the inspection Office has killed the rebels and the dark energy. None of them can leave!"
         He was even faster and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Not long after, he reappeared on the surface of the sea and blocked King Chujiang, who was trying to escape.
         King Chujiang's expression changed drastically!
          "It's you ..."He roared.
         "Kill!"
         The old inspector's shout drowned out all other sounds. His blade shattered the void. Divine powers, superpowers, and combat techniques were all split into pieces by this blade!
         King Chujiang was unwillingly split into two by this blade.
         The old Secretary spat out a mouthful of blood. He turned around and looked at Yuan Shuo, who had been beaten up so badly that he was spitting blood. He laughed."Your disciple is amazing!"
         Yuan Shuo looked at him coldly, not saying a word.
         The old Secretary was embarrassed and instantly disappeared.
         He was still shocked. How did Li Hao become a god art?
         Was this a good or bad thing?
         At the moment, he couldn't make a good judgment. However, he was surrounded by wild slaughter. Some people were fleeing, and some were chasing.
        
         Li Hao's divine power instantly showed its might.
         Not only was the wind Lightning God art extremely fast, but the explosive power of the lightning was also extremely strong. His condition was stable and his five organs were stable.
         In such a state, Li Hao was unbelievably strong.
         At this moment, Li Hao was surrounded by five old men.
         They were all top-tier experts with divine abilities and were in a stable state.
         Other than Hu Xiao, who had been killed, and the old Secretary of the inspection Division, who had just killed King Chujiang, there were two other old secretaries who had yet to appear. Li Hao did not know which two had not appeared, but he did not care too much.
         At this moment, only hou Xiaochen and a few others were by his side, and they were quickly killing the other metamorphosis stage cultivators.
         Hou Xiaochen's face was extremely dark.
         It was almost one shot per person!
         The powerhouses in the transformation stage were so scared that they started to run away. Not many of them survived.
          Li Hao, on the other hand, moved like lightning.
         He did it again and again, but it was difficult to succeed.
         When the five experts worked together, their attack power was not much worse than Li Hao 's, except for their speed. Li Hao wasn't afraid of one person, but he didn't have the ability to deal with five of them.
         At this moment, the five old men's faces were all unsightly.
         The change was too fast!
         "Ha!"
         BOOM!
         In the air, something that looked like a giant millstone fell, suppressing everything in its path. Li Hao's speed was clearly reduced. An old man used his magical power, but Li Hao had no idea what it was.
         He only knew that the space had become much more viscous.
         "Suppress!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com An old man bellowed and waved his hand. A huge millstone fell and surrounded Li Hao, as if it were going to suppress him!
         After hou Xiaochen killed all the experts who were trying to escape, he seemed to want to come over and help. Li Hao shouted,"Go! Kill all the magical powers outside. I'll deal with these old things myself!"
         Hou Xiaochen's expression changed slightly. Without saying anything, he turned into a gust of wind and disappeared.
         Outside, there were still many experts with the ability of God.
         The king of the plains, an wushen, Red Moon, the North Sea King, and the stupa Mountain Master were all fleeing at this moment. Other than the old Duke, who had been killed by Li Hao, and King Chujiang, who had been killed by the old inspector of the inspection Division, the rest of the experts were all extremely crazy. They no longer hesitated and fled in all directions.
         The situation in the city was not good. Although Li Hao was trapped, the scene of Li Hao killing Hu Xiao still made everyone's heart palpitate.
         In addition, Yao si, hou Xiaochen, and the others all had their hands free. With the sudden appearance of the two divine abilities of the inspection Office, they knew that the situation wasn't good, so they didn't dare to stay for long.
         While Li Hao was fighting with the top-tier god art users ...
         The light sword roared, and the power of light burst forth. It instantly slashed down, and with a loud bang, the King of the North Sea was slightly stunned. Even if his opponent used all his strength, it was not as good as a divine power.
         However, at this moment, he only wanted to escape.  Therefore, he was not in the mood to fight with the other party. A Martial Master who had been unsealed was also a top-notch expert. How could he escape so easily?
         The King of the North Sea wanted to escape again, but his expression changed.
         The Inspector General's Secretary is here!
         BOOM!
         A long blade appeared in his hand, and he slashed down. His Divine Art exploded, and with a honglong sound, heaven and earth became solemn. To be able to sit firmly in the position of the inspector Division Secretary, his strength was naturally not to be underestimated.
         The King of the North Sea, who had just advanced in magical power, was no match for him. One of his arms was instantly cut off.
         He wanted to roar and curse.
         The nine divisions sent me here!
         But ... She couldn't scold him anymore.
         The inspector waved his long blade again. An extremely ferocious beast appeared on the blade. In the blink of an eye, with a boom, the beast seemed to have broken the void and the long blade cut through the world!
         Puchi!
         After beheading his opponent, the inspector's body trembled slightly. His body was overflowing with power and his condition was not very stable. He quickly swallowed a few drops of the spring of life to stabilize himself.
         "The Great Northern Sea Bandit is dead!" He laughed.
         As soon as he finished speaking, a deafening sound came from the distance. Tian Jian's sword pierced through the sky. With a loud bang, one of the three elders, who had water and wood dual powers, exploded. With a bang, he was directly crushed into pieces by the sword!
         The other two people's expressions changed drastically.
         It was three against one, and yet one of them was killed. Skysword was probably as strong as Li Hao, but he was slower and couldn't travel through the void as Li Hao could.
         The remaining two elders saw that Yao Si was also about to kill his way over, and their hearts instantly turned to ashes.
         Yao Si was also a top-tier expert.
         The moment he arrived, the two of them had nowhere to run!
          As he thought about this, the sky darkened and the world began to spin. Tian Jian suddenly shouted, "Don't you dare!"
         The huge sword shone through the heavens and earth as it slashed down!
         With a loud bang, a fan appeared in the void. With a loud bang, the big sword was blocked, and the two elders were instantly caught by a big hand. In the distance, on the sea, a man slowly walked over.
         With a smile on his face, a fan appeared in his hand and he gently fanned it.
         Looking at Tian Jian's unsightly expression and then at Yao si, he sighed,""Li Hao actually became a superpower and broke the superpower lock. What a pity, what a pity!"
         Further away, Yuan Shuo's expression changed. He looked over and gritted his teeth,""Ying Hongyue!"
         Ying Hongyue turned her head to look at Yuan Shuo. She smiled and nodded,"Brother Yuan, long time no see!"
         He was handsome and suave.
         After so many years, he was still so young.
         Yuan Shuo shot through the air and stared at him. Ying Hongyue still had a smile on her face. Blue Moon and orange moon stood beside her. Ying Hongyue fanned herself, looking extremely confident and at ease.
        
         It was as if the few people surrounding him were nothing.
         Yao si and Tian Jian were both top-tier experts.
         But he seemed to be fearless.
         He only looked into the city and sighed,""Young man, you're still hot-blooded, breaking up just like that. I have to say, you're stronger than we were back then."
         After he finished speaking, he laughed."Everyone, stop looking. It's not good to see everyone die, right?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Ying Hongyue, will you always be so flashy?"
         A laugh rang out and an incomparably burly man appeared. He punched the old Secretary, causing him to take a few steps back. The old Secretary's expression kept changing. The burly man laughed,"Old Chen, do you want to compete with me?"
         "Yama!"
         The brawny man laughed and said,"old Chen, we're all the same. Stop pretending. Back off!" I won't hold it against you for killing Chu Jiang. Chu Jiang's condition is too bad and unstable. Only you, an old thing, have the nerve to kill him!"
         The old Secretary of the inspection Division raised his eyebrows slightly. The next moment, the Secretary of the inspection Division also arrived quickly. The father and son stood together, blocking the Yama's path.
          Yama didn't mind. He looked around and said regretfully,""Chu Jiang was killed. The second elder of your Elder Council is also dead ... Wushen an is still alive. Doesn't that mean one less elder died than us?"
         "You're right!"Ying Hongyue smiled.
         The next moment, the two of them suddenly attacked together!
         BOOM!
         A loud explosion rang out as the sky exploded, and a longsword was sent flying through the air. The longsword had been heading straight for hou Xiaochen, but it was knocked down by the combined attack of the two.
         In the next moment, hou Xiaochen's spear shot out and killed an wushen on the spot!
         He turned his head and took a look, his eyes cold."You want to stop me with a sword from a distance? Aren't you two doing something unnecessary?"
         The Yama laughed."Just in case. It's only fair if one of us dies, right?"
         In an instant, the void shattered.
         A graceful woman appeared. The flying sword immortal was actually a woman!
         He reached out his hand and the flying sword returned.
         She glanced at Yan Luo and Ying Hongyue, then at hou Xiaochen, and finally at the city. She didn't care about the dead an wushen anymore. Each of the three clans had lost a divine-tier, and she wanted to save them, but these two guys had caused trouble, and she didn't have enough time.
         She didn't say anything and just looked around. Finally, she looked at Yuan Shuo, who was like a Raging Lion. Her voice was calm and cold,""Yuan Shuo, hand over the breathing technique of five birds. We're not here for Li Hao. It's fine if he becomes a superpower, but you just have to hand over the breathing technique. Otherwise ... You probably won't have time to find him, save him, and recover!"
         "Hou Xiaochen and the others are still unsealing their battle-power," she said calmly. "They won't be able to do it for too long. You can think about it. We won't force you. Hand over the breathing technique of five birds and we'll leave. If you don't ... Then we'll just continue to waste time!"  "Hahaha!"
         The Yama also laughed,"that's right, it's nothing for a divine power to die!" Hand over Yuan Shuo, and we'll all leave. Otherwise ... How long do you think Li Hao can last? Other than Tian Jian, how long do you think the others can last?"
         The three of them had not come for Li Hao, but for Yuan Shuo's five birds breathing technique.
         As soon as these words came out, many people's expressions changed slightly.
         That's right, their combat strength had been unsealed, but they couldn't hold on for long. If the three of them didn't come, they could quickly kill the enemy, then meet up with Li Hao and break the blockade of the five of them. Then, they could naturally retreat.
         However, the arrival of the three top experts was unfathomable.
         Not only that, at this moment, a gentle breeze blew by, and laughter reverberated in the void.""I'm interested too. Yuan Shuo, why don't you share the breathing technique of five birds with me? there are some martial masters in the city of supers!"
         The void trembled. A moment later, a man walked out. His eyes were like torches. Many people's faces changed. Heavenly eye cultivator!
         Furthermore, he was a heavenly eye cultivator who had cultivated to the extreme!
         A heavenly eye cultivator in the divine power realm!
         The people from SuperPower City!
         At this moment, their target was actually Yuan Shuo. No matter how good Li Hao's sword was, it was only an external object. For top powerhouses like them, if they wanted to see through the next realm, perhaps ... They had to rely on the breathing technique of five birds.
         Yuan Shuo frowned and remained silent.
          At this moment, the few divine power realm experts who were still alive gathered with the other top experts. The king of the plains, the two elders, and the stupa Mountain Master quickly left the battlefield.
         Out of the nine divine powers in the outer seas, one from each of the three great organizations had died. The King of the North Sea and the old Duke had also fallen. In the battle in the outer seas, five divine power realm experts had died, and five divine power realm experts had died in the city.
         The extremely powerful God art instantly killed 10 people.
         However, with the arrival of the leaders of the three major organizations, the heavenly eye cultivators from SuperPower City, these people's strength increased instead of decreasing.
         Very quickly, Tian Jian and the others all gathered together.
         Huang Yu, Tian Jian, hou Xiaochen, Yao si, and the two secretaries of the inspection Division all had the battle power of a sacred art. The others, including the Earthcover sword, were a bit weaker.
         He didn't seem to have the upper hand in the battle with the ping Yuan King.
         At this moment, everyone quickly gathered together. They all had ugly expressions and stood in front of Yuan Shuo.
         Ying Hongyue and the others weren't anxious at all. They weren't the ones who should be anxious.
         Ying Hongyue fanned herself and chuckled."Brother Yuan, martial arts are meant to be cultivated and passed down to others. The breathing technique of five birds isn't owned by you alone. It's the crystallization of the secret technique of the ancient civilization. You destroyed countless ancient books and created the breathing technique of five birds. If you share it with us, you can push your martial arts to a new peak!"
        
         Yan Luo also laughed and said,"that's right, old Yuan, we're all old friends!" It's not just us. If you keep dragging, the situation will become more complicated. It seems that Haotian is coming. "
         Just as he said that, the void split open again.
         One of them had a smile on his face, his long hair fluttering in the wind."Brother Yama and I are of one mind, you knew the moment I came."
         The mountain Master of clear sky divine mountain!
         Three of the mountain Masters of the seven great divine mountains had arrived today. The three masters of the three great divine mountains, Buddha, Haotian, and sky sword, were all here.
         Other than the two demonic sacred mountains, the other two parties did not care much about this and were cultivating on their own.
         With the appearance of the heavenly Mountain Lord, the number of experts on the other side increased. Just his aura alone was enough to suffocate the people from Southern Fist. He was too strong!
         These people were all people with stable magical powers.
         Not only that, but Ying Hongyue might be even stronger than she appeared.
         He had even managed to ward off Tian Jian's attack.
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Thunderous roars echoed in the city. Li Hao was still fighting in the encirclement of the five experts. At this moment, Li Hao sensed everything, but ... He was powerless.
         There were too many experts!
         It was much more unexpected.
         Unexpectedly, they all came. The three leaders were all mysterious. The master of the Haotian villa was the same. He had always been mysterious. The city of superpowers was named magical power, but no magical power had ever appeared.
         However, the moment had arrived.
         It was as if they only had one goal-to obtain the breathing technique of five birds. This was the best opportunity for them. If Yuan Shuo didn't give it to them, his disciple would be in danger. Not only that, but all the Silver Moon martial masters present would be in danger as well.
         If this dragged on, the only ones who would suffer would be Silver Moon and his men.
         Yao si and the others who had just slaughtered in all directions also had ashen expressions.
         Tian Jian revealed his true appearance. He was extremely majestic and his eyes were extremely sharp. He looked at the few of them and held his sword in the air. He said coldly,"Only the Silver Moon Martial Master who died in battle!"
         Ying Hongyue couldn't help but laugh,"don't say that. We're the same!" I'm a Silver Moon Martial Master. Yama, flying sword, and Haotian might not be all of them, but they're pretty much the same. They all grew up in Silver Moon. If it wasn't for the exclusion of others, these three would also be on the list, right? You see, the three of them are doing very well now, and it's all thanks to Silver moon's nurturing ... We're all filled with passion and yearning for the path of martial masters ... Since that's the case, why should big brother Yuan keep it to himself?"
         Yuan Shuo's face was cold as he looked at them.
         Ying Hongyue fanned herself. When she saw Yuan Shuo staring at her, she smiled."Stop scolding me. There's no point in scolding me. I'm used to it. I can't change it. It's been so many years. Don't you know me well?"
         "You see, my little martial nephew has been forced to become a magical power. If big brother had taught us the breathing technique of five birds earlier ... How could we have let this happen? Although the nine divisions are strong, we're not to be trifled with. Silvermoon's family will naturally help ..."
         The old Secretary didn't say anything. He looked left and right, but didn't say anything.
         Yao SI's expression was somewhat unsightly. He had a somewhat unfavorable start today.  Tian Jian seemed to be prepared to start a massacre at any moment.
         Yuan Shuo took a deep breath and looked at them. He said calmly,""If I give it to you, you'll leave?"
         "Of course!"
         Ying Hongyue smiled and said,"all of you, go. Don't worry!" He was a Martial Master after all, and you knew his character. Of course, I'm not familiar with this person from SuperPower City. It's not easy for a heavenly eye cultivator to cultivate to this level ... However, if we leave, she will definitely die if she dares to stay. Are you afraid of her?"
         The heavenly eye cultivator was a female cultivator.
         There weren't many female experts present. Other than the heavenly eye cultivator, there was also the flying sword immortal. Compared to these two, the Sword of Light and the others seemed to be a little dull.
         "I've obtained the secret technique," the heavenly eye cultivator said softly."I'll naturally leave as well. You don't have to worry!"
         She was a superpower, yet she still needed the five birds breathing technique.
         It was obvious that these people more or less knew something about the five birds breathing technique, because Yuan Shuo had fought once with Li Hao when he was dealing with Xu Qing.
         Normally, even if he killed Yuan Shuo, it would be difficult to obtain the treasure.
         But now ... The timing was perfect!
         ……
         Within the city.
         Li Hao kept breaking out of the encirclement, but he couldn't break through the defense of the five great experts. They had almost completely surrounded him.
          Li Hao suddenly sent a voice transmission, let me out, I'll go and kill those people! If you don't let me out ... Do you think that I, Li Hao, can only break six superpower locks? Can't you guys see that this is the wind and thunder attribute? The five organs lock is intact. My body is weak, but I can still withstand the force of one superpower lock ... Do you want to fight me to the death?"
         The five old men had grave expressions.
         Li Hao sent a voice transmission again, let me out! I've killed those guys who dared to force my master. I won't kill you old dogs, but I'll go and meet them!"
         The five powerhouses looked at each other with grave expressions.
         Should he let Li Hao go?
         Li Hao had killed so many people, including Hu Xiao. As long as he was trapped, the martial masters outside wouldn't be able to receive Li Hao's support. Sooner or later, their superlocks would break, and their organs might even explode.
         Ying Hongyue and the others had also seized this opportunity.
         If both sides coordinated well, it was likely that not a single one of Silver moon's men would be able to escape.
         "If they get the breathing technique of five birds, will they give you a copy?"
         Li Hao's voice was cold and urgent. "I'll give you three seconds to consider. If you don't let me go, I'll break the seventh SuperLock ... Just you wait!"
        
         The five experts looked at each other.
         A moment later, the huge millstone in the air seemed to have loosened a little.
         Li Hao, who had been trapped in the circle of five, instantly disappeared.
         The five elders frowned slightly. They didn't know if this was a good or bad thing, but ... It seemed that there was no worse outcome than this. They hoped that Li Hao could fight those people until they bled!
         It was very difficult for Silvermoon and the other barbarians to yield.
         Silver Moon and the others were worried about Li Hao's safety, but they also had to bear the risk of training in the superpower lock.
         Therefore, they all seemed a little hesitant.
         Even Yuan Shuo seemed to be hesitating.
         However, if Li Hao escaped ... The result might be different.
         They looked at each other, uncertainties and complicated feelings in their eyes. They had let Li Hao go ... But they didn't know if their actions this time would create an even worse situation.
          ……
         When Yuan Shuo replied, Ying Hongyue and the others all revealed smiles.
         As expected!
         It wouldn't have been very effective to deal with Yuan Shuo alone, but now ... Yuan Shuo had wavered. This was a very good result.
         The death of a sacred art that had barely improved was really nothing to them.
         It was difficult to master magical powers, but if the breathing technique of five birds could effectively improve them and stabilize their five internal organs, then magical powers might be nothing.
         Just as they were thinking about this.
         Ying Hongyue's expression suddenly changed.
         He looked behind the crowd.
         As for Li Hao, he also saw them. Without saying anything, the starry sky sword appeared and stabbed into his heart. The blood from his heart quickly fused into the sword.
         He didn't even do this to Hu Xiao and the others.
         At this moment, he was extremely furious!
         He was extremely furious!
         The starry sky sword absorbed blood. In the blink of an eye, the blade turned red. Li Hao knew that these people ... Were more difficult to deal with and stronger than the five old secretaries.
         But ... What could he do?
         The starry sky sword instantly absorbed a large amount of blood essence. Li Hao's face was frighteningly pale.
         His five internal organs felt like they were about to collapse.
         But ... Did he care?
         He didn't care!
         He was dealing with the nine divisions, and the three major organizations had interfered again and again. Did they really think that they were family?
         At that moment, even Tian Jian was slightly moved.
         The big sword in his hand suddenly started to shake.
         As for Li Hao, he instantly pierced through the void, and a blood-red longsword appeared in his hand. There was no sword intent on the longsword, only blood flowing.
         "Slash!"
          A fierce shout came from the sky. This sword strike was like the one Li Hao had seen in the past. He was extremely furious at this moment, and he slashed his long sword at one of the people without caring about anything else!  He wasn't the leader of the three great organizations, but he knew that they were very powerful!
         He might not be able to kill them!
         What he had killed were the experts behind them-elder Hong Yue, the king of the plains, and the stupa Mountain Master!
         These people had all experienced great wars.
         A sword fell from the sky!
         His killing intent pierced through the heavens and earth!
         Even Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. She was a little hesitant. In the next moment, she grabbed orange moon and blue Moon and instantly disappeared.
         When the Yama saw this, he cursed in his heart and also disappeared into the void.
         The flying sword immortal was even faster and had long disappeared.
         Since their people were already dead, Ying Hongyue would rather save the two weaklings and take them away than save the two elders. They didn't need to waste their energy to resist Li Hao's earth-shaking sword!
         BOOM!
         The void exploded, and the two elders and the king of Ping Yuan's expressions changed drastically!
         p Stupa Mountain master's body instantly emitted a golden light.  Golden body protection!
         The king of the plains let out a violent roar. With a rumble, it was as if something had exploded, and his body emitted a fiery light. He was a Martial Master, so at this moment, he was extremely straightforward. He broke a chain, the kind that was completely broken. In an instant, he became a lot stronger, and disappeared from his spot in the blink of an eye.
         The two great elders, however, were too late.
         The difference between them and these people was too great. They had no foundation to speak of. A look of despair appeared in the eyes of the two.
         In the distance, the fleeing Ying Hongyue seemed to feel a little apologetic. She swung her fan and instantly appeared under the long sword. With a crack, the fan that had just blocked Tian Jian's sword was directly shattered!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Ying Hongyue let out a muffled groan and furrowed her brows slightly. She was a little serious. The starry sky sword had been unsealed a lot ...
         Kachaa!
         The void was shattered, and the long sword fell. The two elders were instantly turned into dust, and a crack was directly cut into the sea. In an instant, the sea water disappeared, and then the sea water began to flow backward, setting off a shocking wave!
         As for Li Hao, he had already appeared, his face pale!
         He looked coldly at the few people who were escaping. The golden light on stupa Mountain master's body had shattered, and he was covered in blood, but he was still alive. The king of the plains had retreated far away, and at this moment, the fire attribute super power was overflowing from his body. His face was ashen, and he did not say a word.
          He was a top-notch Martial Master, and he had even suppressed Huang Yu and hou Xiaochen before. He was a true-blue expert with nine locks at his peak. Now that one of them had been completely broken, he was extremely furious!
         "Li Hao!"
         The king of the plains looked at Li Hao coldly. At this moment, his fire-type power was overflowing, as if he no longer had any scruples. He gritted his teeth and said, "You've done it beautifully!"
         It was a huge loss for a Martial Master to completely break the Super Lock.
         How could he not be furious!
         Li Hao looked at him coldly."Break another two before you say this to me!"
         The king of the plains was silent.
         If he broke one, there might still be hope ... If he broke a few more, it would be difficult for him to become a Martial Master again, even if he had to pay a huge price.
         Behind him, five old men came together.
         Even further behind, there were a few of the next generation secretaries running over. In the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by experts.
        
         In front of them, the three major organizations, the sacred mountains, and the city of superpower's powerhouses were still there.
         Behind him, the five old men had caught up with him with many magical powers, but they didn't get close. They were only weighing and waiting for something.
         If the two sides worked together, they could still annihilate Li Hao's group.
         Today, 12 god art had died.
         It could be said to be a heavy loss!
         But now, Li Hao was in the most danger, because he didn't have enough time to repair the SuperLock for everyone, unless they were like the king of the plains. But if that happened, Li Hao would feel bad.
         He had become a superpower, but he could not destroy the hope of all martial masters.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. The small blood-red sword once again pierced into his heart. A large amount of blood gushed in, and Li Hao's face became even paler. In the distance, Ying Hongyue frowned."You haven't reached that stage yet. If you forcefully unseal the starry sky sword ... You'll only end up dying from qi and blood depletion! Li Hao, what we want is the breathing technique of five birds. This is not the time for us modern martial masters to fight to the death ..."
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He drew the Blood Sword again, and an aura, a sword intent from ancient times, spread out from the small sword.
         Li Hao's body swayed slightly, as if he couldn't stand steadily.
          He didn't say anything. He just looked at Ying Hongyue and suddenly smiled. "You're Ying Hongyue!"
         Ying Hongyue was silent.
         "You're very strong ... Ridiculously strong! But ... I know why you didn't do anything to me!"
         Ying Hongyue still didn't say anything!
         Li Hao suddenly laughed."I know why you left after seeing me. Ying Hongyue, how does it feel to be trapped in your own trap?"
         "Li Hao, don't force me. Perhaps I can't kill you, but your master and your friends will all die!" Ying Hongyue frowned and said indifferently.
         Li Hao laughed heartily,"no, no, no, you wouldn't dare!" Ying Hongyue, my Li family is the true head of the eight great families! You're so ambitious, you actually devoured the bloodlines of seven families and merged them together! But ... Your bloodline seems to be very afraid of my Li family bloodline! Ying Hongyue ... You're playing with fire!"
         Ying Hongyue's brows slightly furrowed as she said indifferently,"You can also try."
         Li Hao was still laughing wildly!
         He saw it. That's right. At this moment, he actually saw seven lines above Ying Hongyue's head. Perhaps Ying Hongyue could also see the red line above her head!
         They were all related to the blizzard Silver city's Eight Trigrams.
         However, these seven threads seemed to be somewhat resistant. Some of them even vaguely wanted to approach Li Hao. Li Hao instantly understood why Ying Hongyue didn't go to Silver City or kill him personally!
         He had only been sending people over and not personally killing them!
         It turned out that ... He was afraid of her!
         No, it was his bloodline that was resisting him. This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He had devoured the bloodline power of seven families!
         Li Hao laughed heartily and walked toward Ying Hongyue. Ying Hongyue frowned and instantly disappeared with orange moon and blue Moon. When she reappeared, she was already behind Yama and flying sword immortal. She glanced at the two of them and frowned. "I'll leave him to you. "
         The Yama duo's expressions were somewhat strange.
         Interesting!
         Ying Hongyue seemed to really be afraid of Li Hao.
         Li Hao also smiled.""Your seven meridians haven't merged into one, you should be from one of the eight great families, only one bloodline is compatible with you, the other six are all resisting you! "You haven't completely fused with me. If you had, you might not be afraid of me, but now ... It doesn't seem to be possible! The bloodlines of the other six clans seem to be closer to me!"
         "So what if I am?" Ying Hongyue calmly asked. You can't kill me. You can't even get close to me, even if you get the wind chasing boots. "
         "As for me, I might not be able to kill you, but I can kill your master, your friends, and everyone around you ... Li Hao, why do you have to complicate such a simple matter like making Yuan Shuo hand over the breathing technique of five birds?"
         His bloodline hadn't been completely integrated, so he resisted the fusion and was close to the Li family's bloodline. Therefore, he couldn't fight Li Hao, which could easily cause the other six bloodlines he had fused to collapse.
         However, just as he said, he was very powerful and could kill anyone except Li Hao.
         He could also negotiate with Yama and the others to deal with Li Hao, but they might not be willing to.
         Li Hao was just about to speak when someone suddenly sighed helplessly and said in a low voice,""Ying Hongyue, it's been so many years, but you're still so presumptuous and arrogant!"
         The one who spoke was none other than the earth overturning sword.
         He pressed Yuan Shuo down. Yuan Shuo seemed to want to do something, but he was held down by him.
          Hong Yitang glanced at Li Hao and then at the others. He smiled and said,""Brother sky sword, the taste of superpowers is wonderful, right?"
         Tian Jian glanced at him and said indifferently,"You can also try!"
         "As you wish."
         He laughed and looked at hou Xiaochen,"Forget about you. Your nine superpower locks are not too stable. It might be ten or even eleven ... However, you have your mission. I don't mind."
         Everyone was shocked.
         Li Hao's expression also changed. Just as he was about to speak, Hong Yitang laughed and said,""Strength is about how you use it. Your master has more hope in martial arts. I don't care ... Don't let your master do anything stupid, and you don't do anything stupid ..."
         As he spoke, a monstrous force erupted from his body. In an instant, everyone heard the clear sound of chains breaking.
         Crack, crack, crack ...
         One after another!
         Hong Yitang's smile was still as indifferent as ever."Actually, I've been trying it for a long time. However, I only dared to break the superpower lock on my four limbs and didn't dare to go any further. I'm a little tempted when I saw Li Hao's strength suddenly soar after he advanced."
        
         As soon as he finished speaking, the sword rippled. It was light, but the world seemed to have completely rotated.
         "Li Hao, I have to thank you for the support of your sword all this time. I've benefited a lot from it. Otherwise ... It wouldn't have been so easy to stabilize!"
         His words fell, BOOM!
         A loud sound rang out, and in the distance, the king of the plains was dumbfounded. He looked at the sword in his heart and was somewhat puzzled. When did it penetrate?  "Also, why did you kill me when the three major organizations forced you?
         "I killed you because you're a Martial Master and you broke one of the superpower locks. I'm afraid that you'll continue to break and become a strong enemy. They're not easy to deal with. They're still holding on to their superpower lock because they're worried about you!"
         Hong Yitang explained seriously, very seriously!
         "King of the plains, I killed you because you are worthy of my attention, not because I am targeting you ... I hope you can understand!"
         The king of the plains opened his mouth and suddenly felt like laughing.
         So ... It was like this!
          "Because I'm worthy of his attention. Because I've already broken one, he's afraid that I'll continue to break. He feels that I'm a threat ... Should I be honored?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Perhaps, he should!
         "After all, the Earthcover sword broke the superpower lock just to kill me ... What an honor!
         I used my death in exchange for him to become a super. Isn't that good?
         Hong Yitang pulled back his sword and sighed.""The king of the plains is really talented. His nine super locks are full and have been completely unsealed. There are not many people here who can match him. I will send him on his way first. Minister hou, commander Yu, do you have any objections?"
         "He's your old superior. "
         Hou Xiaochen's eyes narrowed, but he didn't say anything. Huang Yu's face was also cold, and he didn't say anything.
         What opinions!
         On the other hand, the earthbound sword had been completely unsealed, and its superpower lock was still breaking. It was unknown how many chains had been broken, but it could still hold on. Its body ... Had been strengthened a lot like Li Hao 's.
         The king of the plains had died an unjust death.
         However, there were no' if 's.
         At this moment, Li Hao's face was unsightly. He held the blood-red sword in his hand and didn't say anything.
         The earth overturning sword ... Had turned into a superpower!
         Hong Yitang walked to his side and smiled. "It's pretty good. This feeling of invincibility is very comfortable!"
         He smiled and looked at the people opposite him.""Do you still want the breathing technique of five birds? I think that Yao si, hou Xiaochen, Huang Yu, and hou Xiaochen can all do it ... Do we really have to do this?"
         He only looked at the martial masters and did not pay much attention to the heavenly eye cultivator from SuperPower City.
         "Do you want to retreat now, or do you want to try fighting me?" he repeated.
          The Yama laughed."Brother Hong, this is so embarrassing. We didn't mean it that way. Look at this mess. Why don't you try to seal it back?"  Hong Yitang laughed and swung his sword!
         "Yama, you always like to joke. I remember that you were beaten up by Yuan Shuo a few times when you were joking back then. Why don't you remember?"
         BOOM!
         A loud sound resounded in the sky and earth. Yan Luo took a few steps back and his face was flushed. Hong Yitang coughed and laughed."So hard! Your tie bu Yi has also been cultivated to the extreme. When Yuan Shuo beat tie bu Yi to death, you actually ran away. I wonder if your cheap Junior Brother hates you. "
         In the space between the two of them, the void seemed to crack.
         Yama looked at his chest. A bloody gash appeared, but it quickly healed.
         He frowned slightly and looked at Hong Yitang.""How many of the locks did you break?"
         "Guess!"
         Hong Yitang's smile was bright."Do you want to leave?"
         Yama frowned and didn't say anything.
         At this moment, his expression changed slightly. He instantly disappeared, and a blood-red sword appeared. Li Hao didn't say anything, but frowned. She was so fast!
         Hong Yitang wanted to say something but stopped. Why are you so impulsive?
         The next moment, Li Hao disappeared again and reappeared in front of the stupa Mountain Master. The stupa Mountain master's expression changed drastically, and a golden light appeared in an instant. With a crack, the golden light was shattered, and the stupa Mountain Master retreated quickly. "Don't force me. I'll retreat now. I'm not the king of the plains. If you force me to completely unseal myself, no one will have an easy time!"
         Li Hao did not say anything. He continued to swing his sword. Stupa Mountain master's face turned ugly. He suddenly turned around and blocked the sword. He spat out a mouthful of blood. The next moment, he broke through the void and escaped!
         He didn't want to die, and he didn't want to be like these people who had their battle prowess completely unsealed. At this moment, he chose to escape.
         At this moment, a huge sword fell!
          BOOM!
         With a loud bang and a loud rumble, stupa Mountain master's body instantly emitted a golden light. This time, it was different from before. This time, it was a golden light. In the next second, a fiery red light appeared.
         A mouthful of blood spurted out as he threw out a punch. Hong long, the large sword was pushed back. He hurriedly dodged to the back, and with a crack, one of his arms was directly cut off.
         Stupa Mountain master's face turned pale, and he roared again. Crack, crack ... The sound of the chains breaking was heard continuously. He punched back at Li Hao, causing Li Hao to stagger.
         He took the chance to escape and looked at Tian Jian. Not far away, Tian Jian's face was cold."What are you looking at, just unseal it. You're already here, and you want to leave?"
         He was a super and everyone here might have forgotten that he had a top sacred art.
         Now that Hong Yitang was unsealed, everyone actually didn't care about him.
         Since that was the case ... He would give it a try!
         He was the one who had launched the sword attack just now, and it had forced stupa Mountain Master to break the Super Lock.
         A smile suddenly appeared on his cold face.""Let's all completely unseal ourselves. The path of a Martial Master has many problems to begin with, and it's meaningless to hide them one by one! Unseal and transform into superpowers. If we don't kill one side today, we won't retreat!"
        
         He seemed to enjoy watching such a scene. Perhaps he was not sealed in the first place, so he seemed to be eager for everyone to become supers.
         This scene made some people start to feel fear.
         Yan Luo and the others frowned slightly and looked at stupa Mountain Master. Stupa Mountain master's face turned ashen, but he chose to turn around and leave. His voice slowly rang out,""Skysword, Li Hao ... Just you wait! However, if you can turn all of them into supers ... That's the best. I'll be waiting for that result!"
         He had unsealed it!
         At this moment, his combat strength had soared, but he had chosen to leave.
         This wasn't his original intention for coming here. Since that was the case ... He chose to leave so that these madmen Silvermoon could perform better. It would be best if he could force the Yama and the others to do this. If he wanted to be crippled, then he would cripple everyone together!
         The unsealed stupa Mountain Master was too fast, and he disappeared in the blink of an eye.
         Everything had changed too quickly.
         The people watching were overwhelmed.
         Seeing this, Ying Hongyue sighed and shook her head. She wanted to wave her fan, but it was already broken. She smiled and grabbed one person in each hand, disappearing from the spot in the blink of an eye.
          "Li Hao, live well. Goodbye, Silver Moon! Once I'm done with all seven, I think ... I'll be able to form my eighth Meridian soon!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he had completely disappeared.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Yama and the flying sword immortal chuckled when they saw him leave."What a pity ... But he's right. We'll meet again at the Silver Moon. Even without the five birds breathing technique, we'll still take that step ... We'll be there soon!"
         The experts disappeared one by one, choosing to retreat.
         The heavenly eye cultivators of SuperPower City were shocked and wanted to escape into the void.
         At this moment, a loud shout was heard, and in an instant, Li Hao, earth overturning sword, sky sword, hou Xiaochen, Huang Yu, BA Dao, North fist, South fist, Yao si ...
         Almost all the powerhouses who could still burst out attacked together!
         There was only one target!
         Heavenly eye cultivator!
         In the distance, Ying Hongyue, who had escaped into the void, was a little puzzled. She turned her head to take a look and felt a little strange."Where did this idiot get her superpower? we've already left and she's still thinking about it? she's too ugly. Why didn't she give us a reminder ..."
         He felt a little strange.
         We have all left and you still want to stop? do you think the city of superpower is invincible?
         They didn't let us stay because they were afraid that we would completely unseal ourselves and everyone would fight to the death.
         You're just a superhuman, what are you so arrogant for?
         At the same time, Yama had a strange expression on his face. He laughed and cursed in a low voice, "You're brainless!"
         Are all superpowers brain-dead?  There were so many powerhouses here, and they were all holding their breaths. With both Earthcover sword and Li Hao advancing to supers, the Silver Moon Martial Master was almost going crazy with anger.
         You're still staying?
         Why did you think of it?
         Ugly people do weird things!
         Even further away, the flying sword immortal had already disappeared into the distance. He sensed the commotion and smiled in disdain. In his eyes, all non-master specializations were trash, brain-dead, and idiots ... It wouldn't be too much to have one more die.
         ……
         BOOM!
         A firework exploded in the sky above the sky Star sea!
         The powerful heavenly eye cultivator let out a blood-curdling screech as he was instantly blown up. Without any surprises, everyone held their breaths. There were so many strong cultivators, and she was only in the divine power realm. Although her realm was very stable, it was ... Useless!
         Li Hao and the others didn't expect that this woman would be the last to leave. Didn't she see that the Lord of vast sky Mountain had left without a word?
         "Idiot!"
         In an instant, at least seven or eight people cursed out!
         Where did this brainless cultivator come from?
         Even the old secretaries behind couldn't help but curse. What were they thinking?
         Were all pure superpowers this useless?
          Even skysword might not be able to defeat such a powerful woman in a one-on-one fight, yet she was killed by the Silvermoon martial masters!
         The heavenly eye divine power was too rare.
         But ... What was the use?
         In the blink of an eye, they were all gone.
         This was also the 14th divine-tier powerhouse who had fallen today.
         Of the 14 people with magical powers who had participated in the attack, all of them had died except for the stupa Mountain Master, who had escaped. However, the group had caught a heavenly eye cultivator, and they had finally gathered enough people!
         For a time, the starry sky Sea was frighteningly quiet.
         Behind them, there were more than ten supers gathered. They were all god art experts. Five old secretaries and many of the next secretaries were all very serious.
         The three major organizations and the sacred mountain's people ran away. The city of superpower joined in the fun but one of their top-tier God abilities died.
         The violent wind and waves in the entire sea area had stopped, and it was shrouded in a heavy aura.
