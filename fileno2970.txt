The giant pincer seemed to understand, and its heart trembled even more.A seventh rank venerable sovereign!He was at the peak of rank seven and had killed other powerful rank seven existences. However, today, he was telling him that if his desire was too strong, perhaps ... Even he would die Here.He was even prepared for this!"My Lord ..."Wushan didn't say anything else. He didn't have much to say to this person. He looked at the sky and muttered,"At most one month. If I don't return, I'll have to try other methods! The red moon is trying to take over Senlan, so we don't have much of a chance there. Tian Fang ... Still has a chance!"With that, he got up and left, no longer caring about what the giant pincer thought.The giant pincer was sweating profusely, but it did not dare to move.This person ... Was truly terrifying!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao and Kong Ji's speed was astonishing.Although it was still not as good as a level 7, it was much faster than an Ordinary Level 6. They continued to teleport and rushed toward Tian Fang. In a few days, they would arrive at Tian Fang.The two of them were also racing against time. They could not give the Crimson Moon too much time. Otherwise, they would completely Annex Senlan. This time, they had planned for several months, but it would help the Crimson Moon world instead. Then, they would really be giving it away."It's too slow!"Kong Ji had experienced a teleportation before. He couldn't wait. "It's a pity that we're not space-type venerable sovereigns. Otherwise, the teleportation would be very fast! The primordial chaos is simply too vast, and it is difficult to cultivate space ... The space of a small world is not the space of a large world. The Dao of space that can be used to teleport people from the primordial chaos is truly terrifying!"Li Hao nodded slightly. Perhaps it was time for him to study the space.Of course, it was too late now. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  "Let's not talk about this. First, think about how to get into Tian Fang!"Li Hao interrupted him. They couldn't expose their identities this time, or Red Moon would figure out a lot of things."Let uncle yaoyang pick us up?"Li Hao shook his head and said,"I don't want more people to know!" Can you contact Wushan? If we can ... Get him to create some opportunities for us, he can be considered one of the insiders ..."Wushan?Actually, from Kong Ji's point of view, the people from the world of light were more trustworthy. However, since Li Hao said so, he didn't say anything. He nodded and said,""I'll try. By the way, this time ... Are you really going to let Wu Shan enter the Dao universe?""Yes." "Then ... What if it's really controlled by him?""Then I'll be in control!" Li Hao said,"in fact, the Dao universe can't be restored now. It's just an empty shell. Even if he controls it, he can only use it as an empty shell. It's up to me to activate it!" It's not necessarily a bad thing that he's in charge. We might have more opportunities to work together in the future. "Kong Ji nodded his head thoughtfully.Li Hao was quite generous.He had let go of the ninth-tier great Dao universe when he said so. Now, Li Hao could actually renege on his promise!In any case, Wushan couldn't do anything to them!It's just an empty promise, what can you do about it?The two of them sped up again, no longer communicating. Their speed became faster and faster, and after another two to three days, Tian Fang could already be vaguely seen in the distance.However, Tian Fang's surroundings were filled with danger.There might be many other great worlds hidden in the vicinity.Although they couldn't see it, they could vaguely sense some extremely powerful auras. It was difficult to hide a major world. If a major world's Lord had brought a major world with him, even if the chaos concealed it a little, it would not be able to completely hide its aura."We're here!"Li Hao exhaled. Now, it all depended on how he was going to sneak in.As for Kong Ji, he tried to send a message.It was very close to the great world, so there was still hope of communication. He still had people in Tian Fang, such as the rank five guard waiting for him there.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Back to the Dragon Temple.Monarch Wushan was still cultivating when he suddenly opened his eyes. Outside, a monarch said carefully,""Senior Wushan, His Highness ... Hopes that senior will go out and receive them. You can't let anyone know that they've returned,"Wu Shan's eyes lit up!Them?Had the Silver Moon King returned?At this moment, the seventh rank venerable sovereign was overjoyed!'Perhaps my opportunity is here!'The next moment, his heart trembled. What were the two of them trying to do by rushing back to Tian Fang from the Crimson Moon?Perhaps ... It would be a very exciting thing!

2971 Chapter 488
Tianfang world.Venerable sovereign Wu Shan actually held a very important position. Before the arrival of a rank eight venerable sovereign ... Not counting the human King, many people were actually paying attention to Wu Shan, who was at the peak of rank seven and the first expert to enter the Grand celestial world.They were all suspicious!Did Wushan know any secrets? did he know how to open the great path universe?Otherwise, why would he suddenly want to kill Hong Yu, and why would he stay here? no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  If it wasn't for the fact that Wu Shan was too powerful, someone would have already interrogated him.But now, everyone was just waiting.In any case, as long as Wushan didn't leave, they wouldn't leave.At this moment, back at the Dragon Temple.Thearch Wushan moved!The moment he moved, all the experts in the realm instantly paid attention.What did Wu Shan want to do?Sovereign Wushan rose into the air and strolled through the void as if he was taking a stroll. He headed towards the northern region, which was opposite the southern region. He crossed the void. The huge tianfang world seemed to be nothing compared to his feet.The tianfang world was probably the largest world in the chaos so far.The span was huge!p However, to this rank seven venerable sovereign, it was nothing.He looked slow, but he was actually very fast.Not long after, a few venerable sovereigns appeared in the northern region. The leader was the brilliant sun venerable sovereign, who came from the world of light. He was frowning slightly.Everyone had their own territory!Now, in the four regions of North, South, East, and West, cloud heaven occupied the southern region, light occupied the northern region, and the Eastern Region was occupied by the demon race and chaos beasts. There were even major world Lords hiding in it.As for the Western Region, if Hong Yue had come, it would have been occupied by her. Now that she hadn't come, although the people from the chiyang region had come, they had hidden themselves very well and hadn't been exposed. Instead, they had been occupied by the people sent by several Level-7 major cosmos absolute beings.Thearch Yao yang frowned.In the distance, the venerable sovereign of the deep sea also appeared quickly. He followed Wu Shan, feeling a little puzzled.Why did he come to the light region?"Yaoyang!"Wu Shan's voice was not loud, but it reverberated in all directions.Thearch Yao yang frowned slightly and said indifferently,""Wushan, what are you doing here instead of staying in the Dragon Temple?"He was also a top-tier level Seven venerable sovereign in the world of light. He had strong combat strength and was one of the strongest venerable sovereigns in the world of light. Although Wu Shan was strong, he was not so afraid. If Wu Shan was not so strong, he would have captured him and asked him where he had taken the sacred central crypt.Why was he nowhere to be seen?If not for the existence of some weak power of light in the great path universe, which could determine the life and death of the sacred central crypt, the Lord of Light would have taken action because the sacred central crypt was lost.Wu Shan was extremely calm."It's said that the sun is brilliant, and cloud sky and Wu Shan are the two strongest level-seven beings in the tianfang region who are not the Lords of a major world ... I've actually thought about sparring with you for a long time. Today is a good opportunity. How about we spar?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùËâπ!Yao Yang's expression changed.It's not that I'm afraid of Wu Shan, but ... Have you forgotten about the time you sparred with those two people? Or do you think that everyone has forgotten?Have you forgotten what happened to the two of you after your sparring?The neo martial human King did not leave!Good Lord. Now, he seriously suspected that after the two of them finished sparring, the human King would come and kill him?Yao Yang's face was ugly. He looked at him coldly."Wushan, let's forget about sparring. If you have any thoughts, just say it. If you want to start a war, just say it!"Sparring?At this time, who would want to spar with you?The lesson was right in front of him, and it had only been a few months.To venerable sovereigns, it was just a second ago. Do you think I'm senile?At this moment, many powerful wills descended from all directions to watch the show.Wu Shan wanted to spar with Yao yang!They were both at the peak of the seventh level, one was the pillar of Yunxiao, the other was the pillar of light, both were below the realm Lord, top figures. These two sparring ... Did it mean that there was a problem between Yunxiao and light?Behind him, the deep sea Thearch's expression changed slightly.What was going on?Although Yunxiao and Guangming were enemies, they had not shed all pretenses of cordiality at this moment. Wushan had not moved, but once he moved, was he going to provoke Guangming?For a moment, he thought of many things.Could it be ... That he did this on purpose?Fighting against light, once he incited a war between light and cloud sky, the sector Lord and the radiant master would have to split their attention. At this moment, Wu Shan had left, perhaps even the sector Lord wouldn't be able to do anything to him.But ...It was just that doing so would be too dangerous. It was the sector Lord who was too dangerous. At the critical moment, when the sector Lord and the radiant sovereign clashed, a peak rank seven leaving could even affect the entire situation!Deepsea's expression changed. She walked out quickly and said,""Daoist yaoyang, brother Wushan didn't mean to provoke us. He just likes to compare our skills and mantras. Please don't misunderstand!"Wu Shan turned around and laughed."Deepsea, what are you afraid of?"Deepsea remained silent.You know better than me what I'm afraid of.Wushan, don't keep making mistakes!If he continued to make mistakes, there was really no turning back!Wu Shan ignored him. At this moment, his aura fluctuated and the heaven and earth trembled. On the other side, Emperor Yao Yang's expression turned ugly. Was Wu Shan ... Really going to attack?The divine light realm had not made any preparations for war, and cloudsky would definitely be the same.What was Wu Shan thinking?"Wushan!""Do you really want to start a war?" Thearch Yao yang asked coldly."Sparring isn't a war!" Monarch Wushan laughed.Yao yang was a little angry."I'm not afraid of sparring with you because I'm worried that I'll be taken advantage of. Are you playing dumb?"

2972 Chapter 488
"What you're trying to do is to create an opportunity for others?" he asked directly."Do you think that I'm colluding with the neo martial human King?""You know it yourself!""You know how Hong Yue and the other one died that day!" Yao yang shouted.I'm not them!Wu Shan wasn't in the mood to say anything! It was his Highness who wanted to return! And he sneaked back. If I went to pick him up, the commotion would be too big and too obvious. Since that's the case...You'll have to bear some responsibility!He did not say anything more and chuckled.""Then what if I ... Insist on sparring with you?""You ..."BOOM!The sky was filled with clouds and mist. The heavens and earth changed colors as a Dao domain appeared. In the sky, the five-finger Mountain appeared and suppressed the world!All the venerable sovereigns were dumbfounded.Had Wu Shan gone crazy?It was like this again, fighting just like that!It was the same when he dealt with Red Moon last time.At that time, everyone thought it was a joke and that sparring was nothing. In the end, as they sparred, the two rank Sevens were gone.This time ... It happened again!At this moment, all the venerable sovereigns were focused on this place. Many of them were circling the void and sweeping the area quickly, trying to eliminate the human King. They were afraid that the human King would appear at this moment. Many venerable sovereigns were secretly communicating with each other."The human King is nearby?""It's very possible!""Wu Shan might really be in cahoots with the human King. In addition ... As far as I know, there's some news coming from within Yunxiao. Wu Shan has the intention to leave Yunxiao. Perhaps ... It's to join the neo martial artists. It's hard to say whether it's true or false. If Wu Shan joins with the power of the great Dao, the peak of the seventh rank, perhaps ... It can let the neo martial artists enter the eighth rank!""No way? What's the point? he's at the peak of the seventh rank in Yunxiao. Could it be that he'll become an eighth rank after joining neo martial?""Who knows? but there must be a tacit understanding. Yao yang is in big trouble. Even if he can match Wu Shan, there's still a peak seventh-rank hidden in the dark. His attack power is extremely powerful. It's very likely that he'll follow in the footsteps of the other two!""Not necessarily. The radiant sovereign might be paying attention to this as well. He might descend at any moment!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe experts from all sides quickly conversed.In the nearby void, at this moment, two great Dao universes were reflecting the heaven and earth. Two weak consciousnesses began to seep in. Two level-eights were even paying attention!The Lord of the clouds already wanted to curse!Wushan, what are you doing?The Lord of Light was also very vigilant. He did not say anything and quickly swept the area. Was the neo martial human King in the vicinity?This time, you're targeting me, light?BOOM!A massive sun shone through the heavens and earth, and the entire sky started to tremble as the grade 7 power spread out in all directions."You're crazy!"Thearch Yao yang shouted angrily.Was he crazy?He didn't dare to go all out. He still had to be on guard to prevent himself from following in Hong Yu's footsteps. In this way, he was actually somewhat suppressed. The five Finger sacred mountain suppressed all directions, and the sea of fog permeated the air. Even the secrets of heaven seemed to be in chaos.Sovereign Wushan was indeed powerful. However, in a real fight, both sides were equally matched. Today, Yao yang was the one being suppressed!Sovereign Wushan had no other thoughts in his mind and the laws of the great Dao were at his fingertips.Mountains of clouds and seas of mist suppressed all directions. It was as if they were stirring the secrets of heaven. The path of light was covered. At this moment, the huge sun was actually buried by the sea of mist. Countless people could see their battle!The powerful great Dao power swept in all directions, shocking countless venerable sovereigns.Was this the seventh-rank?Previously, in the chaos, he had not felt it deeply. Today, the two sides were fighting directly inside the great world. The strength of their combat power and the wide influence of their battle were unimaginable.The northern region instantly became the focus of everyone's attention.Many people swept through the northern region, wanting to know if the human King was still there.Are you there?He was really there!However, he did not make a move.In the crack of the regional wall, Ren Wang stood with his blade, frowning slightly.It was so F * cking weird!Wu mountain, unfamiliar.It was fine that he killed Hong Yu last time, but to make a move again today ... You can't really expect me to make a move, right?Or was it ... Fishing?I'm too familiar with this.Now, there are so many venerable sovereigns here, including quite a few at the seventh level and even two at the eighth level. Once I make a move ... Good Lord, if it's a trap, won't I be beaten into a sieve?What was this Wu Shan thinking?Which side did this person stand on?As for the cooperation with new martial ... He had never cooperated with the other party before.Strange!The human King looked at him for a while and frowned slightly. This guy was not weak. He had the combat power of the peak of the seventh rank. If not for the world's restrictions, the eighth rank would be Yunxiao's limit. This guy ... Might have a chance of reaching the eighth rank.Of course, he would be better off.The human King curled his lips slightly.Was he at the eighth rank?It wasn 't. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  However ... There was a reason why he wasn't at the eighth level. Yin and yang were out of balance, and life and death were out of balance. The entire yin-yang universe had a major problem. After killing the celestial Thearch, he focused on resurrecting others, causing the yin and yang of the entire world to be out of balance.If not for that, neo martial artists would have entered the eighth rank long ago.If it wasn't to resurrect those people, he would also be a rank eight venerable sovereign now.Of course, he would not regret it!There was nothing to regret.,m Now, if the neo martial art wanted to become an eighth-tier universe, Dao was not a problem, the universe was not a problem, and nothing was actually a problem ... The problem was that it needed a large amount of extremely strong and Yang Qi to supplement it, or countless vitality to supplement the neo martial art.This could make up for the imbalance left behind in the past.

2973 Chapter 488
In fact ... Recently, he had been staring at the world of light. Light was actually also a masculine force. The other one was the red sun from another region.He wasn't really interested in the battle with the Crimson Moon.He wanted to fight with light and Chi Yang.It was just that ... They had already offended Red Moon. If they exposed such thoughts, neo martial would be finished. Three eighth-tier universes would join forces to besiege them. Even if neo martial was not at the eighth-tier, it would be difficult for him.With doubts in his heart, he suppressed these thoughts.He observed the battle between the two of them and then looked around at the people who were constantly sweeping the area. He curled his lips slightly. You bunch of trash, how could you find me?Are you worthy of finding me? "I've been roaming the primal Chaos. I can only be seen if I want to be seen. If I don't want to ... It'll be hard for you to discover me even if I stand in front of you. I can even dig holes in the primal Chaos, let alone in a world. At this moment, he was in the regional wall. All around him, thousands of DAOs gathered, forming a cage-like protective barrier.If Li Hao was here, he would definitely be able to see ... The Dao net!The net of great DAOs!Using the Dao net to form the embryonic form of a world, he covered himself and drilled into the regional wall. Unless he swept it inch by inch, how many people would be able to see through it?The human King had no interest in making a move.Recently, he had been observing Tian Fang and looking for some opportunities in Tian Fang, including Tian Fang universe. He had some clues, but he was still a little confused. According to his deduction, without Tian Fang inheritance, a high-level inheritance, and Tian Fang's original power, Tian Fang universe wouldn't open. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  However, it was said that tianfang universe had opened a few times.Every time, he would lose a Taoist connotation. This meant that someone had used the power of the Taoist connotation ... Well, he had some guesses. It was the Silver Moon King, a fellow he had never met before.He knew that this guy could use the power of time.Therefore, it was very likely that the other party had backtracked time, which led to the appearance of the tianfang universe and the power of the tianfang inheritance.In that case, Wu Shan might really have a lot of connections with that person.Since that's the case ... Even if the sudden attack today has nothing to do with me, could it be related to that person?The new king of the Silver Moon ... The entire world seemed to be gathered here when the battle broke out ...Eh?The human King's heart trembled slightly, and the corners of his mouth rose once more. This was interesting. He wouldn't be coming to tianfang, right?He had also heard some news recently.Old Li met up with the Silver Moon King and played a hand with Red Moon ...Was Wushan's attack at this moment to divert the attention?If that was the case, then it would be interesting. Why didn't the Silver Moon King hang around the red moon? why did he come to Tian Fang?Tian Fang probably didn't have much of an opportunity for him.There were too many experts here.Even he himself had to take it easy.Tianfang universe?This is getting more and more interesting! "It's too peaceful now. Tianfang universe isn't open, so there's no chance to fish in troubled waters!"With a thought, he suddenly walked out of his hiding place.The next moment, a powerful aura quickly locked onto him. In an instant, the whole world seemed to have gone silent.An incomparably powerful and violent aura spread throughout the entire world!Intimidate everyone!Even the two peak grade seven experts were slightly stunned.A person's name was like a tree's shadow!The neo martial human King was an expert who had killed the Lord of a seventh-rank great world and a seventh-rank venerable sovereign of an eighth-rank great world.He was a young Overlord who had risen rapidly.He ... Had really appeared.Yao Yang's expression changed instantly!Wushan ... You ...As for Wu Shan, his expression also changed slightly. He had really appeared. How could he have appeared so quickly? had this person been here all this time?The aura of the human King was violent, but he didn't launch a sneak attack.If it was a sneak attack once, it was a coincidence. If it was a sneak attack again, it would be courting death.His appearance instantly attracted the attention of the entire world. The human King was holding a huge saber. Unlike the Saberman, he didn't carry it on his back. Instead, he held it in his hand and slashed through the sky."Continue!" The human King chuckled.He looked at the two of them and said with a smile, you guys continue playing!He then said happily,"I won't kill you today!" "I heard that there are venerable sovereigns here who have joined the red moon world. Today, I have no other purpose except for one request. Hand over all the venerable sovereigns of the red moon world! I'll leave after I kill them. Otherwise ... I'll kill a level 7 for fun today!"As soon as he said that, countless experts were stunned.You ... What are you saying?Hand it over?Who would hand it over?If you don't hand it over ... You want to kill a seventh-rank?At that moment, a rank 7 major cosmos absolute being directly fluctuated his great Dao and said coldly,""Human King, although you're strong, this is tianfang, not a neo martial arts! Who are you threatening?""Not bad! The battle between new martial arts and Crimson Moon has nothing to do with us! Although a human King is strong, but ... It's not at the eighth rank after all. Even if it's at the eighth rank, can an eighth rank venerable sovereign do whatever he wants?"Someone still tried to probe.The human King chuckled and waved his long blade. The sky changed color as an extremely powerful aura instantly locked onto the few experts in the dark. With a look of disdain, he said,"Killing a stage eight is a bit harder, but killing you ... Is easy! You're not convinced?"He didn't seem to be afraid of getting into trouble or provoking the world's powerhouses!He seemed to have seen through these people and knew that they would not dare to be the vanguard. He sneered and said with contempt,""Neo martial doesn't fear any strong enemy! Even if they were enemies with the world, they would only be so much! "I'm not interested in fighting with you. I've said that the people of the Crimson Moon should be killed. There must be powerful people of the Crimson Moon here. Hand them over and we'll be spared from a war. Otherwise ..."

2974 Chapter 488
Unreasonable!Many venerable sovereigns cursed in secret.You killed Hong Yue's people, so you go and find them yourself!What does it have to do with us?This guy was too overbearing!He asked others to find it for him and even send it over for him to kill ... What was this? Whoever did that would be making an enemy of the red moon.For a moment, even the two tier 8 powerhouses who were spying on him with their will were speechless. This person ... Was really arrogant. Even tier 8 powerhouses were not as arrogant as him!On the other side, Wu Shan was still making his move!Yao yang, on the other hand, felt uneasy. He was being suppressed.Around them, some seventh-rank Masters quickly began to gather. On one hand, they wanted to watch the show, and on the other hand ... They wanted to see if the neo martial human King would make a move.Tian Fang, which had been quiet for a few months, seemed to have something interesting to see again!As for the danger?It was the same everywhere!The master of the seventh rank was not so timid. Besides, the neo martial King was only one person. If he dared to kill others, he would definitely attract the siege of others.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the other side, there was an uproar.Grade seven power appeared, even the chaos was stirred.And near the South realm gate.Li Hao and Kong Ji looked at each other, speechless.Wu Shan is very good!I told you to pick him up, not fight him, but why does this guy look a little perverted?Kong Ji was also speechless. He transmitted his voice."Sovereign Wushan ... He's still okay. By the way, the other powerful aura, is it a neo martial human King?""Probably."Li Hao had seen him in his memory. It should be him."Then the last time ... The one I met in the teleportation was indeed him!""Very strong!" Kong Ji sighed.Li Hao nodded.He didn't say much and just sent a voice transmission,"let's go. Everyone's eyes are on that side now. It's going smoother than expected!" A fight between a few tier 7 experts is much more popular than us!""That's true!"The two of them laughed, and the world of Nirvana appeared. The sky-stealing sun-changing technique appeared, and the Dao domain enveloped them.In an instant, he passed the venerable sovereign who was guarding the southern realm gate.Ever since the Heavenly King was killed, the one in charge of this place was now a venerable sovereign.However, he was only a first stage venerable sovereign!Li Hao's group was still distracted. They used Nirvana and sky stealing, but they didn't sense anything. Li Hao's group didn't use a teleportation array. Instead, they passed through the barrier and entered the sky.And inside the regional wall, someone was watching the show when suddenly, he seemed to have sensed something.He looked in a certain direction and felt an aura of the same origin.He was slightly stunned, but he quickly understood.He laughed!The new king of the Silver Moon?Interesting!'I say, why is Fang ping acting so out of character today? he's also showing off a little. Wu Shan is also ...'I, on the other hand, realized it a little later.It was this guy. Interesting!From the looks of it, the tianfang great Dao universe was indeed very related to him. In that case, the tianfang great Dao universe might be opening up very soon. What was he doing here?The middle-aged cultivator thought for a while.After opening tianfang universe, there would be nothing but chaos. Even if tianfang universe was opened, it might not be seized by others.Chaos ...Not long ago, Red Moon was in chaos.Now, Tian Fang is in chaos again. Does it have anything to do with the situation in the Crimson Moon?Draw the red moon Lord here?Even if they came here ... So what?After thinking about it carefully, he had some guesses, but he wasn't sure because they were bold and crazy. This guy wouldn't have any ideas about the red moon, would he?However, Hong Yue still had two grade-7 experts. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  In addition, there were three other great cosmoses nearby. One of them had two level 7s, making it a total of six Level 7s in the Crimson Moon region.Although he wasn't too sure, Li Zhu felt that ... Perhaps something was about to happen on Tian Fang's side.Next, there might be more Level 7s and even more level 8s!There were not many level eight venerable sovereigns in the regions near tianfang. Currently, there were only five level eight venerable sovereigns, including Guangming, Yunxiao, chiyang, Dragon Lord, and Hongyue. He did not know how many would come when tianfang was in chaos.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Bang! Bang!With a faint sound, Li Hao and the other man exited the boundary wall and entered Tian Fang.Li Hao smiled and looked around. There was a great commotion in the North!"I'm afraid my uncle yaoyang is very nervous now!"Kong Ji said helplessly.Wushan really knew how to find people.It was very dangerous for the human King to come out and interfere.Then, he sent a voice transmission to Li Hao, do you think the human King has a purpose for staying in this area?The human King was here to seize the great Dao universe?Not necessarily!Then why did he stay here?The red moon's people were not here."Let's see what we can do, or ... Do you want to deal with your father?""What?"Li Hao was only guessing, but it was still possible. He said telepathically,""Your father is the radiant sovereign, so he must be very masculine, right?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùKong Ji was startled and nodded.He seemed to have realized something and was a little speechless.It was really possible.Something that was hard to say!"I'll remind my father later!"This was the only thing Kong Ji could do. As for persuading the human King ... Forget it. He only knew venerable the sword, not the human King. Furthermore, they did not have any friendship.Li Hao didn't say anything.The disappearance of neo martial might also be to solve some of its drawbacks. Supreme and the others didn't even care about Crimson Moon, so it was possible that they were solving the problem by themselves. Of course, this had nothing to do with Li Hao at the moment."Let's go to the dark Demon Ridge!""Is Huilong still here?""Who cares!"The two of them smiled and disappeared in an instant. They flew toward the dark Demon Ridge. It did not matter whether the Dragon Emperor was there or not.

2975 Chapter 488
If he really ... Killed a group of seventh-rank martial artists, he didn't mind killing one more. As for who killed them ... It was the human King. Why should the human King kill them? it was because they had to hunt new martial artists before returning to the venerable Emperor of the dragon clan.What does it have to do with us!As for the human King, he was there, so how could he kill the Dragon ... Nonsense, even Supreme martial artists could clone themselves, so who said that the human King couldn 't?The two of them looked at each other and smiled happily.In this place, the death of a Tier 6 really didn't matter.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Fortunately, the Emperor was not in the Hui long temple.Two of cloudsky's Tier 7 experts had run away. How could he dare to stay here for long? it was not that he was afraid of being killed, but that the people above had gone out to fight. No matter what, as cloudsky's subordinate, even if he was afraid of being killed by tier 7 experts, he had to follow.It didn't matter if he was slower, at least he had the attitude. This guy was afraid of death and had brought all the venerable sovereigns back to Dragon Temple to escort him. He was not afraid of anything even if he was slower.This was actually very convenient for Li Hao.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Dark Demon Ridge.Li Hao and the other man directly entered.In reality, the mark of the Dao chess was still inside Tian Fang. The two of them could be teleported back. However, although the teleportation would cause a small commotion, there were too many rank 7s now. They had to be careful. It was best not to be exposed if possible.In the dark hall.A shadow appeared.He was a little surprised to see the two of them. In fact, they had not been apart for a long time, but Li Hao had reached level four, and his power of level six was much more stable. Moreover, the Taoist connotation in their bodies was rich, and they might have a deeper understanding of the great Dao."Congratulations!"The mysterious man replied politely. He was actually quite optimistic about these two.And today, that was indeed the case.A few months had passed, and he had improved so much.Li Hao smiled."Thank you for your help, senior. Otherwise, we wouldn't have had a chance if brother kongji didn't go!""It's fine. He provided the energy himself. I only helped him a little ... Besides, he promised himself that he wouldn't ask for any conditions when he reached the 5000th square!"Then, he said doubtfully,"the two of you have come ... The world is not peaceful now. There are many grade-7 experts. I'm afraid that there are seven or eight of them. There are even more who are still outside!" "There's also a rank 8 cultivator who's been paying close attention to this place. It'll be very difficult for the two of you to get any good fortune in the Outlander domain ...."Li Hao laughed,'senior, aren't you just an opportunity? Daoqi, hasn't senior always been open to US? With our return this time, we also have the intention to play Go again!""Oh?" the mysterious man was stunned for a moment before he nodded."That's good. You finally remember!" no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  I thought you guys had forgotten!Dao chess was indeed an opportunity.Unfortunately, these two guys had never cared about this feeling. They ran away halfway.This time, it's interesting. He risked his life to come back just to play chess? Li Hao didn't say anything. He looked at Kong Ji."How far did you go last time?""It didn't leave after 3000 slots."Li Hao laughed."More than me. I only reached 2000 squares. I didn't leave." Since we're back, there's still some time. Let's take a walk?""Alright!"Kong Ji nodded his head. He was in a hurry to reach level six. Now that he had comprehended three types of two extreme Dao, it was not bad to play chess once. He could perfect the orthodoxy and stabilize his realm.,m Besides, if he didn't continue walking, how could he make a request?It would be embarrassing if he kept overdrawing.Although they felt that the mysterious man would probably agree, wouldn't it be better if they fought for the opportunity themselves?Since the chance of 5000 cells was gone, then he would go to 6000 or 7000 cells!Seeing how eager the two were, the shadow didn't say much and presented two chess pieces. Some of the light spots were lit up, indicating that they had already walked past.The two of them didn't waste any time and went straight for the chess board.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The last time Li Hao entered this place, he was only a weak second-level venerable sovereign. Now, he had crossed the threshold of the lower level and entered the fourth level. Furthermore, he had seen more. He had a deeper understanding of the Dao net, the world, the universe of the great path, and the embryonic form of the world.Entering it again, the feeling was completely different!He now understood what he didn't understand before. He entered a grid, and without saying anything, a boundary appeared and quickly absorbed the energy of the grid. Then, he walked out of it and entered the next grid at ease.The shadow was slightly stunned. So fast!It wasn't the kind of speed that could be used to forcefully break it apart. This fellow ... Seemed to have truly seen through the essence of the Dao. In just an instant, he had broken apart the revolving Dao.What was going on?It hadn't been long since Li Hao had entered. Last time, although Li Hao had the intention of stalling for time to plunder energy, he hadn't been too fast and had needed to analyze it bit by bit. Today ... It had passed in an instant, and even the energy had been extracted.One square only lasted for an instant.On the other side, Kong Ji was not slow either.The two of them walked as if they were on flat ground. Li Hao was really different from last time. He walked to the next grid and looked for a while. Another boundary appeared, and the energy was extracted. The power of great DAOs in the grid was instantly extracted.Continue!It was like a hot knife through butter!What was there to be curious about the first time? now, there was more anticipation. What was there to anticipate?He was not looking forward to 3000 or 4000 slots ...He began to look forward to seeing if a Dao net with space as its main element would appear after he had gone through all the boxes!Yes, he had some suspicions. After 9999 squares were completed, it might represent the path of space!

Unfortunately, even if he was, he couldn't finish walking now.The power of a great Dao was directly integrated into the small world. For Li Hao, it used to be a lot, but now it was like a drop in the bucket.One square only lasted for an instant. In the blink of an eye, Li Hao had crossed over a hundred squares with irresistible force.At this moment, the mysterious man understood ... He was speechless.This guy is really something. The last time I came, I didn't know what's going on. This time, he's actually starting to condense the myriad domain?He was really ... An incredible fellow!He then glanced at Kong Ji. Although Kong Ji had not condensed ten thousand domains, he had walked three kinds of two-extreme Dao and had a deep understanding of the great Dao. He had been wandering in the great Dao since he was young, which was something Li Hao did not have.At this moment, he was also walking very quickly.The two of them seemed to be in a race, one faster than the other.Outside, the battle was fiery.Wu Shan wasn't sure if the two had entered, but the two had already walked a few hundred squares.Li Hao had forgotten what was happening outside.After walking for a while, he felt even more delighted.This time, it was a supplement to himself. He realized that Dao chess was actually a detailed division of a Dao net. He didn't know if it was the Dao net of the tianfang universe, but ... If it was, he would have a deeper understanding of the tianfang Dao universe.The dark Demon Ridge wasn't just a cultivation ground for the dark emissaries. Dao chess was perhaps the true inheritance ground of the master of Tian Fang!"Interesting ... If the Dao chess presented the Dao net of tianfang universe, then the great DAOs of tianfang universe are actually arranged in such a way ...""The key is ... 9999 squares!"Li Hao gasped. If that was the case, the Dao that represented Tian Fang might be the most perfect great Dao in the current chaos. When there were ten thousand DAOs, the 'ten thousand DAOs' usually meant nothing!For example, Li Hao's 360 star paths, he also said 10000, but ... Where did 10000 come from?There were only 360 types, which was 720 types!This was the power of ten thousand DAOs that Li Hao had mentioned!People like revered sword might have mastered a little more, but they would not have more than 3000, and they were not too powerful.But ... Were there really 10000 types of Tian Fang Dao?No, 9999 types!Terrifying!Would a person like the master of tianfang really die?Who could kill him?Or could it be that there was an even more powerful existence in the chaos?The chaos that Li Hao and the others were in today was only the four major domains, but it did not mean that it was the entire chaos.Li Hao didn't have the time to think about this. He walked very fast and observed the chess pieces. The more he looked, the happier he became.What a powerful technique of weaving great DAOs!The last time he saw it, he didn't see it as clearly as he did today.Before he knew it, Li Hao had reached 3000 steps. The mysterious man didn't interrupt him or say anything. He walked 1000 steps in half a day. Last time, Li Hao walked 2000 steps in half a month! The difference was too great.Li Hao, who was at the fourth step, was completely different from before.On the other side, Kong Ji had also walked to about 3800 squares. His speed was not slow, and it was normal for him to slow down a little later."These two ... Can they reach the 6000th square this time?"The emptiness wasn't a big problem. The mysterious man wanted to know if Li Hao could go that far.6000 squares represented the Dao before Tier 6. It was almost a flat land. Solitary was originally Tier 6, but it was still very difficult to reach 6000 points and above.And Li Hao was only at the fourth step."If I can really reach the 7000th square ..."At this moment, the shadow fell into deep thought. If they really reached the 7000th square, the two of them could even make a request and directly take away the Dao chess pieces. This was one of the rules set by the master of Tian Fang. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  7,000 cells meant that if one was lucky enough, they could directly advance from tianfang universe to Level Seven and become a high-level venerable sovereign. They would then officially be in charge of tianfang universe!For many years, no one had been able to reach the 7000th square.Even among the light and dark emissaries and five elements emissaries, only the light and dark oracles and five elements emissaries had reached more than 7000, even if they were at the seventh-grade.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the outside world.Northern region.The appearance of the human King made the situation even more complicated. The human King arrogantly asked for the Crimson Moon Warriors to be handed over, but who would do such a thing?Seeing that the situation had reached a stalemate, more and more powerhouses gathered.Wu Shan, who was the instigator, suddenly stopped. It was almost time. As for whether the two had entered or not, he wasn't sure. But as long as he wasn't too stupid, it should be fine.As soon as he stopped, so did the brilliant sun Supreme Emperor. He looked a little upset.As for Wu Shan, he appeared to be very calm."Don't misunderstand. I have no connection with the human King. It's just a spar. Last time, the human King's first strike was also me. I don't want everyone to think that I've teamed up with the human King!""There are too many people here today. They all want to join in the fun. How boring. Yaoyang, let's fight another day when we have time!"With that, he turned around and left. 'This bastard!' Supreme Emperor Yao yang was furious.He came as he pleased, fought as he pleased, and left as he pleased ... What did that mean?He wanted to get angry and was about to speak when he suddenly looked up. The overbearing human King had suddenly disappeared, and his voice reverberated,""Wushan, I'll contact you later!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWu Shan, who was in the distance, paused for a moment, but he didn't stop. Human King ... How interesting.Must you give me some eye drops to be happy?He ran really fast!At this time, the venerable sovereigns quickly transmitted their voices,""He's leaving just like that?""There's something wrong with this guy, Wu Shan!"

"It's really just sparring? Or is it a test?""It's hard to say. We'll just treat them as a group for now!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùIn the dark, the willpower of the rank eight venerable sovereign, venerable cloud heaven, suddenly fluctuated.""Guangming, I don't know if Wushan is working with him, but Yunxiao is not!"Light Thearch was silent for a while, then his will fluctuated."The divine light plane is the same! My son and the new king of the Silver Moon seem to have some sort of connection, but our divine light plane has no understanding of his new martial!"He had never come into contact with it!However, there was nothing he could do now that the outside world, especially the red moon sovereign, might guess something.The two level eight venerable sovereigns didn't attack or descend. Their wills only appeared. This meant that they were not far from Tian Fang. They might even be inside Tian Fang.The two sides had a brief contact and explained the situation. This neo martial human King had little to do with them.He didn't want to be mistaken for someone else.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Wu Shan didn't care about what happened behind him and went straight back to the Dragon Temple.Beside him, the deep sea venerable sovereign had a heavy expression."Wushan, this isn't right. You've provoked everyone again and again ..."Wu Shan turned his head to look at him. After a long time, he said,"If I leave the clouds, I will try my best to replenish the clouds 'energy. If the realm Lord stops me...It's normal. However, I hope the three of you won't stop me!""You've made up your mind? "Deepsea's face changed."Yes!""I'm determined to leave!"Wu Shan's expression remained the same. I've lived long enough. I've said it before, I'm not betraying you, but if you think it's betraying, I won't refute it! If the realm Lord wants to stop me, then I ... Will resist, I will not let myself be captured!"Deepsea could not hold it in any longer.He wanted to leave!He had to leave no matter what.He couldn't help but get angry,"that Yao yang is also a top-tier level Seven, why didn't he ask to leave?" You have indeed contributed a lot to Yunxiao, but hasn't yaoyang been fighting for Guangming all this time?""Everyone has their own aspirations!"Wu Shan only replied with four words.Deepsea wanted to continue, but Wu Shan turned to him. "That's all I have to say. If I continue, I'll break our relationship! Also, my chance might be to return to the Dragon field ... You, Huilong, and the others are not allowed to go back to the Dragon field. The Dragon field is mine!""You ..."Wushan looked at him, his eyes cold."Deepsea, we've known each other for so many years. You can object, you can refute, you can persuade me ... But you can't stop me! If you stop me again, or even ruin my escape plan, I ... Will make my move on you!" After saying that, he turned around and said without looking back,"you and I are not the same. You don't understand me all these years! In your eyes, there is only the sky. In my eyes, there is the sky, but I also want to see the chaos!"With that, he disappeared completely.The deep sea Thearch was a little dejected. He looked at the direction in which he had disappeared and was speechless for a long time.In the end, they still had to part ways?Would the realmlord agree?You're at the peak of the seventh step, the number two figure of cloud sky. When the chaos is in turmoil, you want to leave ... How would the sector Lord agree?Did you forget that in the great Dao universe, the realm Lord still has the final say!Deepsea felt bitter. At this moment, he suddenly saw a group of venerable sovereigns wandering toward them from not far away. He suddenly became angry and shouted in a low voice,""Return to the Dragon!"Hui long Emperor was shocked. He flew over and said,"my Lord ...""We don't have to go back to the Dragon field!""Since you like to travel so much, then from today onwards, follow me and patrol all the Taoist reserves in the world!" The deep sea venerable sovereign snorted coldly.Venerable Emperor Hui long was speechless, but he didn't dare to refute. He hurriedly nodded and said,""Alright!"Did I provoke you?He was really ... Unreasonable.Let's see if you'll still be so arrogant after I reach the seventh step.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the next moment, Wu Shan had already returned.As soon as he landed, he looked at the dark Demon Ridge, and his eyes flickered. He had returned.He revealed a smile.The threat was out there. This time, if the Silver Moon King didn't open the sky universe for me, I would slice him up!At this time, I have no way out!This time, he would either succeed or die! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  'I look up at the sky. If the sky can't bear my Dao, if it can't let me break away, if it can't let me advance to the eighth rank ... Then I ... Might have to go and seize the Crimson Moon!'At most, he would just take a gamble!His eyes were closed as he hovered in the air, unmoving as if he was dead. The surroundings were frighteningly silent. Everyone could only see monarch Wu Shan circling around the Dragon Temple with a monstrous aura.

2978 Chapter 489
Sovereign Wushan chose to return to the Dragon returning temple. He sat cross-legged in the air above the temple. His powerful aura attracted many people's attention.What was this guy trying to do?The Wushan today seemed somewhat inexplicable.He couldn't understand it!Wushan didn't need them to understand it. If they did, it would only be troublesome.He was only thinking that it would not be too long before those two fellows came out. The two of them had gone to the dark Demon Ridge as soon as they came back without even saying a word. He wondered if they had teleported away.Returning to the dark Demon Ridge should be for the chess piece.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Just as venerable sovereign Wu Shan was attracting the attention of the experts ...In the temple in the dark Demon Ridge.In the chess game.Li Hao had already reached the 3500th square, while Kong Ji had easily broken through the 4000th square and was now at the 4200th square. The gap between the two seemed to be closing, but Li Hao's speed was much slower than before.At this moment, the small realms in Li Hao's long river World became more and more active.In fact, it even started to give birth to some other small realms.Divine runes appeared one after another as he breathed in the power of the long river and continuously perfected the entire long river path.Li Hao was overjoyed.Dao chess was a monarch weapon refined from an eighth-rank world and owned by a ninth-rank venerable Emperor. It was indeed a top-tier treasure. In the chaos, Dao chess might be the strongest monarch weapon.Even though it was an eighth-tier universe weapon, it could still be considered a ninth-tier sovereign weapon.The human King's saber might be a Grade 7 monarch weapon.The other powerful venerable sovereigns rarely used monarch weapons. Even if they did, they would not be too powerful. Even longevity Swordmaster did not have a weapon. He only used his great Dao as a sword.Such a monarch weapon was mainly used for enlightenment, so it was very helpful to Li Hao and the others.Even the dark emissary, a former level eight tianfang venerable sovereign, didn't make it to the end.Some of Li Hao's little realms also began to improve. The originally crude Dao net, which was called a Dao net, was not even as good as a tree root. Now, as Li Hao walked through one dage after another, it began to fill up.The shadow had said that if Li Hao was willing to continue training here, he would definitely reach the sixth step, and even the seventh step.It could be seen that the Dao chess itself had a powerful and boundless ability.Li Hao and Kong Ji didn't say a word. They were fighting for each other's spots.In fact, they did not say that they wanted to compete with each other ... But the truth was that they were both prideful people. When Li Hao and the Tier 5 from The Dark World entered the path of chess together, Li Hao did not even bother to pay attention.But today, the other side was empty!Since it was Kong Ji ... Li Hao became a little competitive. His level was not as high as Kong Ji 's, but Li Hao felt that his understanding of Dao might not be any worse than his. The opportunities he had obtained were not few!In addition, with time in hand, he could also see some opportunities that ordinary people couldn't see. In Dao chess, he would be worse off than Kong Ji?His understanding of the Dao net was not better than that of a seventh-rank venerable sovereign, but Li Hao felt that his understanding of the Dao net was definitely not weak among the middle-stage venerable sovereigns.Previously, he had killed a Tier 6 martial artist. Kong Ji refused to admit defeat and immediately killed two!He had a chance of killing two of them, but it was ruined by Senlan's Yan Fang.In that case ... Let's take a walk in Dao chess today!Previously, Li Hao started from 2000 squares and Kong Ji started from 3000 squares. This wasn't a big deal. The starting points were different, but the limits didn't look at the starting points.Li Hao turned his head and glanced at the empty space. It was more than 4000 squares.There was still a big gap between him and her.He entered another Dao GE and quickly comprehended and absorbed the power of the great Dao within. He sought to create a new Star with divine runes and form the embryonic form of a new world.The empty silence next door had an indifferent expression.In fact, he was not indifferent.When he first met Li Hao, he was a level four Supreme Emperor while Li Hao was a level one.Now, he was at the sixth step and Li Hao was at the fourth step.Both sides were improving rapidly! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  It had only been two years since they first met. To venerable sovereigns, it was a matter of a snap of the fingers.But ... The foundation was different!He had been a fifth level venerable sovereign and had only re-cultivated, while Li Hao had truly started from scratch. Now, both of them were in the middle level, and the gap was not as great as imagined.,m At this stage, Kong Ji felt that he was definitely stronger than Li Hao. If Li Hao didn't use the power of time and instead used the power of those at the seventh step, Li Hao would be no match for him.However ... Once Li Hao really perfected his little world and stepped into level five ... At that time, although he was also a six paths two extreme Supreme Emperor, Li Hao was a Supreme Emperor of the myriad world fusion and time. Even if he no longer borrowed strength ... He might not be able to defeat him!This was an incomparably huge pressure!Kong Ji looked calm, but he was actually very ambitious. He didn't care about the Hui long Emperor at all.Among the rank six venerable sovereigns, there were not many that he paid attention to.However, Li Hao ... Could he bear the fact that he might become an invincible middle-stage venerable sovereign?Seeing that Li Hao was accelerating, he kept accelerating as well. The Power of Six paths rotated, and life, death, and Nirvana were all activated to the extreme. Li Hao had comprehended ten thousand DAOs, while he was trying to fuse them by force. The two took different paths.4300 cells, 4400 cells ...Gradually, the speed of the emptiness became slower and slower. At this moment, he had come into contact with some interesting DAOs. Although he still wanted to surpass Li Hao, he couldn't do it just because he wanted to, so he chose to stop and comprehend them.He glanced at Li Hao from the corner of his eye and curled his lips. Li Hao definitely didn't comprehend anything!

2979 Chapter 489
To win for the sake of winning, tsk!What kind of ability was this?Forget it, I won't argue with him.The two of them were immersed in this atmosphere. By the time Kong Ji walked out of his 4500 cells, Li Hao had actually broken through 4000 cells. This time, Li Hao's aura had changed!The Dao on the 4000th square was a Dao that was very beneficial to Li Hao.In Dao chess, there was a special Dao for every thousand.The 4000th square that Li Hao encountered might be a very special path of purification. At this moment, Li Hao gave up his silence and suddenly said,""Brother Kong Ji, have you gained any insight into the 4000 grid Dao?"Kong Ji turned his head. Heh, showing off to me?Showing off?He had passed 4000 squares?What's the big deal!I just walked past it!Of course, as he thought about this, Kong Ji smiled and nodded,""I've gained some insights. What about you?""He's quite powerful!""The path of purification ..." Li Hao said."What?"Kong Ji was startled, he removed all distracting thoughts and frowned,""Purify? Are the DAOs we've comprehended the same?""Senior, is brother Hao Yue's and my way of playing chess the same?""It's the same!"The illusory figure spoke,"there is only one kind of arrangement in the game of chess!" "Of course, different individuals may have different perceptions, so it's normal for there to be some deviations.""But even if there's a deviation, it shouldn't be to the extent of a deviation in the fundamentals of the Dao...Haoyue, you comprehended purification?""Yes, what about you?"Li Hao was also curious. Was it different?"No!" Kong Ji shook his head."What I feel is not purification, but isolation!"Isolation?Li Hao was stunned. What was this?Since the two of them had comprehended the same Dao, even if there was a difference, it shouldn't be so big, right?"Brother Kong Ji, can you ... Show me ... Your isolation?"Kong Ji nodded, and a faint will of the way appeared on his body. It was somewhat otherworldly, as if it was isolated from the mortal world. It felt like he was floating in the air.Kong Ji said,"if dust doesn't fall on my body, I can also break all techniques!" This Dao separates the inside from the outside. It's a kind of defensive technique that's clean and free from dust!"  no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  "Even if there are ten thousand DAOs on my body, I can still remove them. This is the Dao of isolation!" He laughed.After saying that, he looked at Li Hao."Your so-called purification. Is it the same as me? not stirring up dust?" If that's the case ... How can this be considered purification ..."The mysterious man nodded.Ten thousand Arts don't apply to the body!It was indeed a type of isolation technique. It was quite powerful and could be considered a defensive technique.It isolated ten thousand DAOs!The mysterious man also had some understanding of the 4000 grid Dao. Although it was not the same as what his predecessors had comprehended, Kong Ji's comprehension was still considered very powerful. He was indeed a talented and intelligent person!As for Li Hao ... What did he comprehend?Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly. "I don't think so. I think brother kongji has made a mistake. This Dao is not a defensive Dao! By doing so, you've isolated the exchange between the inside and the outside ... Although it has a defensive effect, the effect is only so-so. ""My purification ... Is completely different. It can improve my body and purify my Dao!"After saying that, will of the way emerged on Li Hao's body. The next moment, thousands of DAOs converged. In an instant, a special effect seemed to have appeared. DAOs merged with DAOs. In the blink of an eye, acupuncture points appeared on Li Hao's body. Suddenly, the last acupuncture point appeared on his buttocks.BOOM!A loud sound rang out, and an extremely strong power of filth burst out from his buttocks. It was as if all the impurities in his body had been removed.Li Hao's whole body seemed to become transparent.Although it was very unsightly and even looked vulgar ... At this moment, Kong Ji was stunned, and so was the mysterious man. Li Hao seemed to be extremely comfortable. He laughed."Fellow Daoist, you've isolated yourself from the outside world, but I'm different. I've combined the inside and the outside, which also counts as isolation. What I'm isolating isn't magic, not Dao, not myself, but impurities!""With a fart, all the chaotic DAOs will be eliminated ... Although I can't do it to the extreme yet, when I reach the extreme, I'll be able to transform completely!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùKong Ji stared at Li Hao for a while, then said,""Our comprehensions seem to be completely opposite! This ... Can it reject the Dao of chaos?""Yes, I can!""Interesting," Kong Ji said."Even the same Dao can produce two completely different effects. I isolate the inside from the outside, and you exchange the inside and outside Dao ..."He didn't say who was more powerful, nor did he say that his Dao wasn't as good as Li Hao 'S. He just sighed.What Li Hao had comprehended was somewhat unconventional, but in terms of actual effect ... It might be better.His Dao of isolation was an external technique.And Li Hao's path of purification was internal strength! The 4000 grid of Dao actually had two completely different effects. At this moment, the illusory figure also pondered and sensed for a moment, then said,""Li Hao's Dao is also very good. Although it's a little unsightly, it's a Dao that can improve a cultivator's body. In my opinion, it's slightly better than Daoist kongji's comprehension."There was silence.Was it?He didn't say anything, but thought for a moment and said,""This magic can only be cultivated in secret. Otherwise ... It won't look good! Haoyue, do you want to change your method, and spurt it out from another aperture ..."Li Hao chuckled."That won't do. It'll be even more disgusting if it's changed to eyes or mouth. You must know that this is the Dao of filth in the body!" If it comes out from below, it's still acceptable, but if it comes out from the mouth ... Will it spit sh * t?"
