(I'm a little busy back home. Sometimes, a few friends I haven't seen in a long time will come and chat with me for a while. It will take a little time, but I try to keep it up as much as possible, and may be a little late.)There was a thump.He fell into the river.Li Hao gasped for breath. For the first time, there was fear in his calm eyes.Chasing time!In fact, Li Hao wasn't too surprised that a Supreme martial artist had discovered him. Top-level existences could more or less sense him.However, at the last moment, he could be considered to have traveled through time!However, the human King of that era, the Emperor Cang of that era ... Was actually able to chase after time and find him directly. Such a method was the most terrifying.One had to know that the current him was actually just returning to his past memories.This also meant that ... In his memory, the human King and the others had such terrifying strength at this time. It was simply unimaginable.One said,"next time you come, I'll beat you up!"One said,"the next time you meet it, you have to bring it food. Otherwise, it will eat you ..." It said it calmly, but it sounded extremely terrifying! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "Hu!"Li Hao panted heavily, and he visibly aged.Zhang an, who was beside him, also heaved a sigh of relief. He wasn't too afraid. Be it the human King, Emperor Cang, or the Supreme martial artist ... They were all his acquaintances, his family.However, this time, it seemed to be the first time that he had observed himself and others from a third person's point of view. He suddenly realized that there were many interesting things that he had never noticed before.In the past, people like venerable the sword and the Qin Emperor had some special interactions with him.The sword of the venerable sword and the method that the Qin Emperor used to find trouble ... Were actually to find trouble and also a form of training. Unfortunately, he didn't understand and didn't care about these things at all.His grandfather had always been concerned about him.From hope, to disappointment, and then to peace ... As long as you are safe, I don't ask you to do anything.As for leaving him in Silver Moon, perhaps ... He simply felt that it did not matter. Even if he were to be killed, when he returned to Silver Moon, he would still resurrect him, and he would kill whoever killed him!This was his grandfather!A smile appeared on Zhang an's face. He felt a little emotional and had an indescribable feeling.So ... It turns out that everyone doesn't care about me as I thought.Zhang an turned to look at Li Hao and smiled.""How is it?" Li Hao also laughed."Interesting! Amazing! Terrifying!"This was his comprehension.An interesting era, a powerful character, the terrifying human Emperor Cang."Any gains?"Zhang an asked again. Li Hao had gone there to ask about it, but in his opinion, perhaps due to his own experience, he had not had much contact with the top existences. Li Hao probably did not gain much. Li Hao nodded."Yes! A great harvest!"Zhang an was puzzled."Dao," Li Hao said,"cultivating the Dao and the mind!"He had always thought so.He was not interested in the Dao. He was more interested in the journey of cultivating the heart. This time, it was a journey of cultivating the heart.He had gone to that era and experienced it himself ... Only then did Li Hao understand why so many experts had appeared in that era.Because ... Neo martial arts all cultivated the heart.It wasn't a special intention, but the factors of the era that created this group of people. They were for the people, for themselves, for the era, for their race, for their faith, for protection ...It wasn't intentional, but he had blended into that era and was naturally brought into it.Therefore, they were all cultivating their hearts.Therefore, the human race of that era didn't need to specially cultivate their hearts. As long as you could integrate, as long as you were willing to stand up and fight for that era, you would actually have achieved great success in the path of the heart!Silver Moon and neo martial arts competition were actually still lacking something. It was lacking in life and death, the life-threatening danger that would last for thousands of years at every moment, and the competitive heart that had to fight for martial Dao, for survival, and for the day.Silver moon's people were actually used to getting by ... When the imperial family was in charge and when the nine divisions were still around, they did not have much resistance.The human race in the new martial era was fighting for every opportunity because they could be destroyed at any time.Zhang an was stunned. Cultivation of the Dao and the mind.He had heard these words many times.However, the neo-martial humans did not care about this. Li Hao said that he had realized something.Seeing his confusion, Li Hao added,"senior, you're different from me. In your era, everyone was cultivating their hearts. Since you're all in it, you're actually cultivating your hearts and awakening in the same era. As for me, Silver Moon, I'm only at the beginning. My heart of awakening has just sprouted ... If we're to compare, our era is more similar to the early stage of neo martial ..."The most initial stage!The people had not yet awakened and had just begun to develop some awareness. At this time, they needed people to guide them.This was the beginning of an era!The era of the human King was officially on track. Li Hao believed that Silver Moon would be able to do the same in a few decades, but he was still lacking."Have you improved?"Zhang an asked again.Li Hao chuckled."It's not that simple ... It's just a journey of the heart. You'll gain more insights and feelings. The improvement of strength can't be done overnight. You can take it slowly.""But ...""Senior, please calm down!"Li Hao looked up at the sky and smiled."The outside world is indeed very interesting. I actually want to go out and get in touch with those people. In the true sense, I want to see zhizun and the human King. They're all interesting people, and they have interesting souls ..."

Chapter 2541 Hello, Primal Chaos!
Zhang an was slightly dazed. In Li Hao's eyes, there was yearning and expectation, but ... No fear.He was very curious. Was Li Hao really not afraid of them?"You're fearless?""Why should I be afraid?"Li Hao smiled."Talking and doing interesting things with a group of interesting people is actually life. It's an experience." A happy life lies in a good experience, and knowing people is interesting ..."Zhang an suddenly felt that he had lived in vain all these years."Actually ... I'm afraid of coming into contact with some strong people. I always feel that I can't fit in with them ..." He sighed.p Li Hao nodded."That's because you haven't discovered some of your own characteristics and lack confidence ... For example, venerable Emperor Qin is an amazing person. He never cowered when he came into contact with strong people. He was confident that he would surpass them sooner or later, become one of them, or even surpass them ... This mentality is the reason why he could still rise despite being surrounded by a group of monstrous geniuses.""That's because the seed favors me ..."Just as Zhang an said this, he paused. Li Hao interrupted,""No, the will of the heavens is nothing!"Li Hao shook his head."The heavens favor too many people. Not everyone can become an omnipotent expert. Silver moon's will favors people too. What's the result?" Even if the will of heaven favors you, you will still be you. Some people, even without the will of heaven, can still go far, but the process will be more complicated!"He firmly believed that even if the new martial artist, Qin's venerable Emperor, was not favored by the will of heaven, he was at least a venerable Emperor, and not an ordinary one.That was because they had enough tenacity and characteristics.This was something that many people did not have. Ordinary people were the masses, and mediocrity was the only thing that mattered. Those who had their own unique characteristics could rise with the wind as long as they seized an opportunity in any era!Zhang an lived in that era, but he did not have a deep understanding of the powerhouses of that era.Li Hao, on the other hand, could see some differences.Perhaps ... I'm more outstanding than Zhang an?Li Hao laughed, a little sneaky. He glanced at Zhang an and said,""Senior, let's not talk about me. How do you feel now?""Sigh ... In the past, there were many things that I didn't understand, didn't understand, and even had some resentment towards ... This time, when I went back to take a look, I suddenly realized that actually ... There are many things that I still don't understand.""I have some ideas, but I need some time," he said."When Silver Moon advances, it might be an opportunity for me. However, even if I do improve, half-step sovereign is my current limit. Venerable sovereign ..."He shook his head and did not continue speaking.A half-step sovereign was the limit he could see at the moment. He was clear that he had yet to reach the level of a venerable sovereign.Li Hao also nodded. That was indeed the case.If Zhang an wanted to become a venerable sovereign ... He would need more things, including some battles, some madness, and some determination.Li Hao didn't say anything. He quickly said,""I'll need to go into secluded meditation for a few days to absorb and digest the information. I just don't know ... Whether or not the Paragon and the others will be able to acquire this additional memory. "Could he?He was not sure.Last time, his teacher had gained a new memory, but both of them had been within Silvermoon's range. This time, however, they were separated by a world and a chaosverse. Would he really be able to receive something? If he could ... That would be interesting!It was possible that the chaosverse would soon experience some unexpected changes.……At the same time.In the chaos, in the endless wilderness, a cat, like a planet beast, suddenly opened its eyes and mumbled,""Someone is bringing me food ..."As for who it was ... Who knew?How interesting!At the same time, in the cat's eyes, there seemed to be a universe, a pond, and countless small dried fish swimming in the world in the eyes as if they were alive. And those dried fish ... Seemed to be living creatures, top-tier powerhouses.A small fish swam in the cat's eyes, which were filled with fear.It was a scene of chaos Rangers, chaos beasts, and even a world Lord. They included worlds, but they were still reduced to small fish, struggling and swimming in the eyes of the cat. It was a terrifying scene!At this moment, there was another world in the cat's belly. Yin and yang were fused together, and it was extremely mysterious!Among them, an extremely majestic existence suddenly opened his eyes.He suddenly laughed!Silver Moon!Interesting, very interesting.The people my grandson brought with him traveled through time and space, the past and the future.He looked up and chuckled as if he was looking at a cat.""Big cat, wake up ...""He's awake!"The big cat's voice sounded in his ears.The old man stood up, put his hands behind his back, and smiled gently."It's good that you're awake. Summon all venerable sovereigns, travel through the chaos, and head to the Elysium. This time, we'll destroy the Elysium!"The Elysian world!In the past, a top-notch major world had been ambushed by the human King and almost tore apart the seed world. Later, the Crimson Moon world came to help and the neo martial artists retreated.At this moment, the human King was not here. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  However, the old man suddenly said that he wanted to attack bliss again and destroy this top-tier great world.The big cat's voice sounded again,"meow, bliss?" Was he going to fight again? Cats don't want to fight ...""I'm not fighting, but fishing!"The old man chuckled and said,"this time, Lord of bliss will be your cat food!" "However, the other party is not weak. Summon longevity sword, Wang Jinyang, li Hansong, Qin Fengqing, sun god, Heavenly King suppression, and the others back. These guys, don't run around anymore. While Fang ping has attracted the attention of all parties in the chaos, follow me to suppress bliss ... Since we've offended him ... Then we'll ... Annihilate him!"

Chapter 2542 Hello, Chaos!
There were very few enemies for neo martial ...Because we will cut the weeds and eliminate the roots!Since the previous attack had not succeeded, this time would be the best.It just so happened that the human King was outside, attracting the attention of countless powerhouses. Without the human King around, everyone thought that neo martial arts only dared to avoid him ... What a joke. The powerhouses of neo martial arts did not rely on Fang ping to conquer the world!"Should I call them all back?" the big cat's voice was filled with doubt."Right!""Oh ... Okay!""Yes," the big cat replied. Its huge body wrapped around the world and began to wander through the primal Chaos. Waves of special ripples spread through the primal Chaos.Destroy bliss!The Elysium world was a top-tier world. Its world Lord was very powerful, not much weaker than the human King ... Of course, it was still a little weak. Otherwise, it would not have been almost killed by the human King.He didn't manage to kill him the last time, but this time ... He managed to kill him!Even though the human King was not around, this group of people seemed to be extremely confident and arrogant.At the old man's location, many illusionary figures appeared out of thin air. Someone asked,""Hit who?""Bliss!""F * ck!""Kill!""Why now?""My grandson asked me to hit him!""Nonsense!""It's true!"“……”The group of people were making a ruckus. It was as if they didn't care about the reason or excuse. They were just asking. Since the Supreme martial artist said that they wanted to fight, then they would fight!"The great Dao of bliss is not a bad great Dao. Can you destroy the other party's great Dao universe?""Yes! Big cat, eat it!""So the lazy cat is willing to do it?""I'm willing ... I heard that second cat has recovered, and the lazy cat owes it some dried fish ... Prepare more, or else it will seem like the lazy cat is too stingy!""Then do it! When will the human King return?""No, just us!""F * ck, this is tough. Old Zhang, you're really gut...I like it, let's do it!"“……”A group of Bandit-like figures flew into the depths of the chaos like locusts.Just as the human King said ... We are all pests!"Don't provoke us. We'll beat whoever provokes us. If we can't beat them, we'll beat them to death. If we can 't, we'll fight later ..."As for the Elysium ... Who asked them to provoke us last time?The human King insisted on leading the team and led them the wrong way. In addition, the old cat didn't know the way. The two of them really went the wrong way. They went to the blissful great world to ask for directions, but the old man was so arrogant that he wanted to eat the human King and the old cat ... Asking for directions was giving them face. Since they didn't want to give it to them, they would beat them to death!It didn't matter who he was fighting, he didn't care if he had one more enemy. Now that he had offended them ... He would offend them even more and completely annihilate them!……On the other side.In the depths of chaos.One of them held a saber and casually emerged from the chaos. He looked around and suddenly remembered something. He chuckled and said,"Interesting, interesting, and fun!" Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  As soon as he finished speaking, he looked back. Suddenly, the void fluctuated, and many ancient and powerful existences followed closely behind.The ancient words exploded in the man's ears.""Fang ping, you can't solve the problem by running ..."The man turned around and grinned. Escape?Who gave you the wrong impression?Why would a bunch of small shrimps have such an illusion? was it because they were too old that their brains were not as bright?He grinned."I heard that there's a great world nearby with a bad reputation. They even tried to intercept me, the neo martial Swordmaster, once ... It's called the endless sky World. How do I get there?"Behind him, an ancient existence had a cold expression.""Cut the crap. The Azure world is infinitely far away from here. The nethermoon world is the closest here ...""Yue Ming? Hong Yue's brother? Why do you have the word "month" in your name?""Where?" the man was furious.Behind him, that expert was also furious. He kept acting dumb. He really hated this guy. He kept acting dumb.But very quickly, he sneered,"to the North of this place, 30000 Primal Chaos iron ruler ...""Where is the North?"“……”The man looked around and was a little confused. F * ck, they were all the same. Chaos had no direction. I really admire you guys. Your strength wasn't that great, but you could still tell North, South, East, and West.Weren't all chaos the same?You can also distinguish North, South, East, and West?There were no obvious characteristics, so he said,""How powerful are the world Lords of the Dark Moon world? Was he the strongest here? Was it far from the Crimson Moon world? Are you with Hong Yue?"The powerhouses behind no longer paid attention to them. Instead, they waited, waited for other powerhouses to arrive ...Uproot the scourge of this universe!No one was as unbridled as this person in the chaos. Many chaos Rangers had been killed by him simply because some of them ignored him or spoke ill of him when he asked for directions!The primal Chaos Rangers had almost all run away.The man turned to look at him, making a quick judgment. 'This guy's strength is average. He's not some unrivaled expert ... Forget it, I'll just be a reserve. If the Lord of the Dark Moon realm is a good person, I won't kill him.'If it's a bad guy who's stronger than him, I'll kill him.If I can't find them, or if they're not bad, I'll kill these people ... As a promise!Unfortunately, why hadn't he found the Crimson Moon?Where was red Moon hiding?Didn't you say you wanted to attack neo martial?Why are you hiding from me? How hateful!When I catch the red moon master, I'll cut him into pieces and make him into dried fish for the big cat to eat every day ... Damn it, damn it, damn it!

Chapter 2543 Hello, Primal Chaos!
Speaking of which ... That being that had transmigrated here, the one that had added some memories to his past ... Just what was that?Forget it, who cares!I just want to kill someone!Ignoring the people behind him, he turned to leave. However, he deviated from his original direction once again. The powerhouse behind him snorted coldly. Here he comes again. He said he was going to the Dark Moon world, but what was the result?As expected, it was just a trick to fool people!Very quickly, the void fluctuated, and several experts arrived.""Where did he go?""He went east!""To the East?""Right!""Damn it ... Where is that guy going? Is he really in cahoots with the Crimson Moon? he's been going around the Crimson Moon for more than ten years, but he just doesn't want to go ... I'll never believe that they're not related!"How hateful!You've been going in circles around the Crimson Moon for so many years, but you're not going to the Crimson Moon. Do you think we'll believe you if you say you're not with the Crimson Moon?"Let's not care about this. The East is The Dark World. The Master of Darkness is extremely powerful ... He mentioned last time that he wanted to join the alliance and destroy new martial and red Moon. Since he's gone ... This is an opportunity. This time, I can annihilate this person in the dark World!"Then, an ancient being sneered,""I deliberately said to go north just now because I knew what he was thinking. He definitely wouldn't go north. As expected, he went to the East. I guessed it!"In any case, that guy was just going against her on purpose.This time, you've finally fallen into my trap!The master of the Dark Universe was an existence in the vicinity, second only to Red Moon master ... This time, Fang ping would definitely be annihilated here so that he would not have the chance to harm the chaos again!……The months and months of chaos were different from the Silver Moon.In the outside world, the Silver Moon would pass by for several days, or even several months.Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.The stronger one's strength, the harder it was to improve, and the longer one's seclusion would be.To Li Hao, seven days seemed like a blink of an eye. It didn't feel as long as it had been in the past.Between the heaven and earth, there was a long river.Time passed by like a white foal.Within the river, a star flickered. It was the time star.A tree, a rock, and a square seal could be vaguely seen. At this moment, they were also absorbing the power of the long river to strengthen themselves. They were truly the Three Treasures of the revered sword that forged the foundation of the world. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The star suddenly turned into Li Hao.Li Hao walked out of the river and looked up at the sky. The Stargate in the sky became even clearer.Near the Stargate, there was even a sense of time disorder.Li Hao knew that once the Stargate was opened ... The Silver Moon would no longer seal itself. At that time, chaos and the Silver Moon would be unified. There should be some differences between the Silver Moon and the outside world. This was also a form of self-protection for small worlds and a way for them to develop themselves.He swam over and tried to comprehend time. Not much time had passed in the outside world.A hundred thousand years for the Silver Moon ... In the outside world, it might only be a few dozen or a hundred years.The time difference was huge!However, there was a difference. Once the Stargate was opened and connected to chaos, the Silver Moon would definitely have a large amount of energy pouring in. It would no longer be as barren and self-sealed as before.The advantage was that there was more time, but no matter how much time there was, the energy would be insufficient, and it would be difficult to support the cultivation of the strong. Such a world ... Actually did not have much future. For example, people like Zhang an could only fall into a deep sleep because of the lack of energy.Other than wasting his life, it didn't seem to be of much use.Li daoheng and the others had prepared a large amount of resources in advance ... Otherwise, they wouldn't have made any progress and would only be wasting time."The Silver Moon ... Should be connected to the chaos!"Li Hao thought to himself. Although it was more dangerous this way, if they did not connect with chaos, they would be shutting themselves off from the world. They would not have much of a future.Now, as the number of powerhouses increased, the problem could be clearly seen. There was a lack of energy!An even stronger expert that wasn't strong enough had appeared.The daomerge was a minority. Once too many daomerge cultivates...They wouldn't even be able to train in the daomerge.Silvermoon's energy could not leave, but neither could any energy from the outside world enter. If not for the primal Chaos lightning striking down and the deaths of a few peak-level existences, Silvermoon would not have advanced at all.In the long run, it would only be detrimental to Silver Moon.With the stagnation of their cultivation, everyone would have no choice but to wait for death, sleep, or kill each other. There was no other way!The river trembled, and Li Hao's voice echoed.""Senior second cat!"At the end of the river, a cat was a little impatient and unhappy ... What an annoying person.Why do you always call for a cat?"Meow!""I wish to break out of the stellar Gate, and the primal Chaos lightning will descend! I have a presumptuous request ...""Meow!"Second cat was a little unhappy, so he didn't say anything.Li Hao smiled."Only when the river is stable can it be more real. In fact ... In the true sense, my true body will descend there!"Second cat immediately turned around and looked at Li Hao."The past is in the past ... But it doesn't mean that existences of the past can't descend ... And we can descend in the past with our true bodies ..." "Take a fragment and repeat it infinitely. That's the real world!"Li Hao's words were complicated, but second cat understood."What do you want the cat for?"Second cat was a little unhappy. What an annoying young man. I don't like you anymore!"It's simple. The descent of the lightning will definitely attract the attention of some powerful enemies ... At the critical moment, I need senior to help me absorb a few lightning bolts so that you can withdraw your hand and kill the powerful enemies!"

Chapter 2544 Hello, Primal Chaos!
Li Hao's smile was brilliant."That's all I need to do. I'll spare some time to make those guys think that I'm defenseless. That's the only way I'll have a chance to kill them!"Even before he left, he already knew that there would be a strong enemy.This was required for the advancement of the world, and it was also a tribulation that he had to overcome to reach the venerable sovereign level.It was a Heavenly Tribulation and a human tribulation!Everything in the universe had its own rules.Second cat thought for a moment and nodded his huge head."Okay, don't lie to the cat ... There used to be someone who liked to lie to cats, and then ..."What happened after that?"What happened after that?" Li Hao asked curiously."After that, the cat ate all the dried fish in his family. He never had any dried fish to eat again!"“……”Li Hao was speechless. I thought you were scared.She was really ... Speechless.He didn't say anything more. Soon, his voice reverberated,""All Dao integration and above cultivators, come see me!"There was no time to lose!I don't know if the human King and the Autarch did anything, but I need to leave the Silver Moon immediately. On one hand, I need to connect with the primordial chaos, and on the other hand ... I can't hold on much longer.Previously, he had made a trip to neo martial and consumed a lot of his lifespan. If this continued, he would die of old age naturally.Did people who died of old age have a future to speak of?It would be hard for flowing time to resurrect!……Very soon, Dao integration cultivators arrived one after another.Including some neo martial artists, they also rushed over quickly.Li Hao waited for a while, but didn't see anyone. He said,""Senior Empyrean pole, come quickly!"“……”The surroundings were silent.After a long time, the void shattered. A man looked at Li Hao with a displeased expression."Why did you call me?"I don't want to come!"Senior, I've met the Supreme-being and the human King. They asked you to do more ..." Li Hao smiled.The celestial pole's darkness?What did that mean?Li Hao chuckled."I walked over and saw them. They told you to work hard!"Is that true? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Tian Ji was stunned and a little uncertain. On the other side, Zhang an was also speechless ... You went to see neo martial and didn't learn anything else, but you learned the great trickery of the human King.You're no longer that Li Hao!It was really ... The closer one was to Vermillion, the redder he would be!Heaven's Fate wasn't sure, but he knew that Li Hao would have to go through Zhang an to get there. He looked at Zhang an, who had a dark expression on his face. Li Hao's voice rang in his ear. "It's just an avatar. I'm just fooling him. Actually, even if I didn't fool him, senior Empyrean pole would still have taken action. After all ... He's the strongest expert after me. He can't escape the world's advancement either!"  Zhang an helplessly nodded.Heaven's Fate curled his lips in disbelief.However ... He knew that it would be difficult for him to avoid it. He looked at Li Hao helplessly."You must have been to the past ... And even met the human King!"F * ck!There's no other reason other than the taste of your hoodwinking. It's somewhat similar to the human King. What the hell, you could have learned from anyone, but you learned to hoodwink from the human King!Li Hao laughed, and Heaven's Fate couldn't help but say,""There's no need to smile like the human King. In the past, your smile was feminine and not bad ..."Feminine?Li Hao was speechless!These words!When have I, Li Hao, ever been feminine?"Alright," Li Hao said helplessly."I'll try not to laugh too loudly in the future, in case you misunderstand!"After saying that, he did not continue and instantly returned to the main topic,""I want to open a Stargate and transcend the Tribulation to become a saint Emperor. I want to cooperate with Silvermoon's advancement!"Li Hao didn't wait for anyone to reply and continued,""This is a decision, not a discussion. I have to do it. If I don 't, I'll die in three months and my lifespan will be exhausted!"As soon as he said that, everyone who wanted to speak immediately shut up.No one objected!Li Hao looked around at everyone."There will be danger this time. I'll take the chaos lightning tribulation!" "What you need to do is very simple. Senior-martial uncle Hong and gan Wuliang will be the leaders and merge your two DAOs into one. The others will merge their DAOs and two DAOs to advance together with the Silver Moon world. This time, your two DAOs will merge into one with senior-martial uncle Hong as the leader. With the earth overturning sword as the main focus and defense as the main focus, we will definitely be able to stop a venerable sovereign with everyone's strength! With the power of the Silvermoon world and the power of ten thousand people, they can definitely fight against a venerable sovereign ... But only one!"Qian Wuliang didn't say anything, and Hong Yitang nodded quickly.Seeing this, Li Hao added,"if we succeed, everyone will benefit. If we fail ... We're all done for!" "Also, there might be an opportunity that day ... When the chaos changes, the invading experts will be in chaos ... If we seize this moment, we might be able to kill the enemy! If he could kill a venerable sovereign and merge with the Silver Moon, he would be able to push the Silver Moon to a higher level! Even if I can't step into the great world, I'll still be able to obtain a vast amount of resources. I won't have to worry about resources anymore!"After saying that, he looked at the few of them."King Dali, you have to stop a Thunder tribulation for me at the critical moment!"The Dali King was startled and nodded. He already knew this.Only ... For you?Aren't you flirting with me?What was the meaning of this?"Queen, you're going to stop a lightning tribulation!" Li Hao said.The Queen of the West was a little unwilling. It was very dangerous, but ... She looked at Li Hao helplessly and could only nod.""Alright ... But ... I ...""You can do it!"Go to hell!It was so dangerous!Li Hao then looked at Heaven's Fate."Senior, what you did was very simple ... You hid first. At the critical moment, you appeared from the outside and pretended to be senior Heaven's Fate ... You just had to call for the return of the neo martial artists! It's not dangerous and it's in line with senior's expectations!"Tian Ji was stunned. Just this?This ... Was not bad.Yes!Using neo martial arts to intimidate everyone?

Chapter 2545 Hello, Primal Chaos!
This one's okay!"Senior Zhang an!"Zhang an looked at Li Hao, who smiled and said,""What you need to do is simple. The book of Dao, present everything you can. Cooperate with senior Empyrean pole and create the illusion of the return of the new martial artists. When you are needed, you will appear. Your book of Dao can present the great Dao of Supreme, human King, blood Emperor, and the others ... Exhaust everything and present the appearance of the return of the emperors! "You only need to do this to shock the People's hearts. I hope that neo martial can shock the heroes. Then, this will be an opportunity!"Everyone looked at each other, and Zhang an nodded.It wasn't difficult, but it was actually quite troublesome. After all, Li Hao's current imaginary enemies were all venerable sovereigns.Would those who wandered the chaos be able to do it without the power of a venerable sovereign?At this moment, Yuan Shuo said,"do you really believe that there will be a venerable sovereign?" And there's more than one?"Li Hao nodded and said,"definitely!" This was a calamity! My tribulation, the Silver Moon's tribulation, the fact that I've ascended to the world realm too quickly, and that I've mastered time ... All of this doesn't conform to the Laws of Chaos!""Even the new martial arts have gone through the beginning stages and the origin stages, but I, Silver Moon, have reached the sky in one step. From a low-tier world to a mid-tier world in an instant, there will definitely be natural disasters and man-made disasters!""Everyone, seize the opportunity ... This way, we can celebrate the slaying of the Emperor!" He said.Li Hao laughed."Inform the people. Tell them that they must work together to overcome the difficulties that day!" Only when everyone is United and the great Dao is gathered will there be hope of successfully transcending the Tribulation!""If we fail this time, Silver Moon will completely decline, or even completely disappear!""There's only one chance. I've already reached a temporary tacit understanding with the neo martial world's human King and Supreme martial artist. I hope they can give us some help. Similarly, in return, we'll also repay neo martial world in the future!"The neo martial artists did not take it seriously, but the Silvermoon people did.They felt that Li Hao could do it!In the end, Li Hao looked at one person."Ninth Division commander, at the critical moment, please lend me your sword intent!"The ninth Division commander was stunned for a moment before he nodded.He was just a little confused. Was sword intent useful?He had obtained li daoheng's sword intent, but he discovered that it was only at the half-step sovereign realm. To Li Hao ... It wasn't very useful, right?Li Hao, on the other hand, looked at the sky and said nothing.Li daoheng's sword intent was not considered strong now ... But his sword intent could actually be integrated. It could be integrated instantly into the longevity sword intent, the longevity Swordmaster's sword!It was only because li daoheng himself didn't want to do it.But now, Li Hao didn't care about this.This was the crucial stage for them to leave the Silver Moon and step into the chaos. If they failed this stage, they would die without a doubt! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If he missed this opportunity ... He would never have another one.Li Hao wasn't sure if the human Kings and Supreme-beings could create an opportunity for him in that instant, because they couldn't communicate with each other anymore. Second, the flow of time was different, and no one knew when they would make their move.Similarly, they didn't know what would happen to Li Hao.Even though they knew that Li Hao was from Silver Moon, they still had no idea about Silver moon's situation ... This would test the tacit understanding between the three parties!Out of the three parties, one of them had to make the first move. As for who it would be ... It would depend on fate!In fact, Li Hao was still somewhat confident. Once the Stargate was opened, which was forged by neo martial arts, the other party might be able to sense something. This was an opportunity, not a complete gamble!The key was whether the Supreme martial artist and the others could understand that the moment the Stargate opened, it was time for them to make a move.Were they ready? He would use a greater disturbance to cover the Silver Moon's movements and draw the attention of the chaos experts.This was the key!If the chaos was too huge, it would not attract too much attention. Li Hao was actually rather curious and expectant. Could these people really create an opportunity for him?Who knows!"Ten days later, open the Stargate!"Li Hao set the time. The flow of time in the outside world was even slower. He needed to give those people some time to prepare. Ten days later ... It was actually short enough. The key was that he could not delay any longer.Otherwise, once it entered a period of weakness, it would be a huge problem.Also, he had borrowed power from many futures, and the primal Chaos lightning tribulation was one of them. At the crucial moment, there might be other changes. With this thought in mind, he turned to someone and sent a message,""There's one thing you need to do. If anything happens to me, you need to quickly control time, with life and death! In the next few days, you'll be wandering the river and controlling the power of time. Get used to it. I need you to buy me some time just in case!""Also, when the time comes ... Time, reality, and Phantom path, combine them into one! It originated from a great Dao universe, so it can be done. When the time comes, you will be in charge!"Lin Hongyu's heart skipped a beat and she nodded.Three DAOs could all be combined into one?This was something that no one had thought of and was unclear about.Sure enough, Li Hao had countless backup plans every time he did something. It was just that he didn't want to explain it too clearly to everyone before, but this time, he did.At this moment, Li Hao looked at the sky again and smiled.""If I win this battle, I, Silvermoon, will definitely step into new glory! The primordial chaos is vast, and there are countless worlds. Silvermoon, it's time to tell the primordial chaos about you!"Hello, chaos!We're here!This universe is so wonderful. If there are existences like the human King, there must be more interesting existences. I can't wait to see this chaosverse!In an instant, everyone was a little infected.Li Hao was the Supreme expert of this era!The Supreme of neo martial!He had started this new era and led this new era to a different future.

2546 Chapter 424
The Stargate hung high in the sky.The Stargate was the world's Gate and the strongest barrier. This gate was built by the strongest venerable sovereigns in the new martial era.Even venerable sovereigns found it difficult to enter the Silvermoon world.The bone eroding Emperor had been sealed for many years. He had a Stargate above his head, but he could not break it and leave the Silver Moon. An expert like that could even break into a small world, but the existence of the Stargate prevented him from doing so.The Stargate was perhaps the strongest weapon in the Silvermoon world.There was a small courtyard near the Stargate.Li Hao was taking a rest here.Anping residence.The residence of the sword Lord was inscribed by the human King. Although it didn't have the lingering charm of the great Dao, it was still overbearing. The few big words still suppressed the small courtyard. Even when Li Hao and Li daoheng fought here, they couldn't destroy the small courtyard.A man, a sword, and a dog.At some point, the Black Panther had snuck into the courtyard and crouched beside Li Hao. It looked up at the sky with Li Hao, its dog eyes showing some frustration.Demons, the new generation of demons. It might be the strongest existence.However ... He was still very weak.Ever since the appearance of second cat, ever since li Fuhai joined him, ever since he found out about Emperor Cang's existence, ever since Li Hao took control of time ... Black Panther felt that his position had been seriously challenged.Heibao was actually very smart.Li Hao, the master of this era.Just like neo martial in the past, the human King and the gray cat shared the world and advanced together, entering the realm of the world Lord.It was just like how Zhan Tiandi had brought two cats with him to shoot the heavenly Emperor.This was its imagination, but now it seemed ... As soon as the Stargate was opened, experts would be everywhere in the primordial chaos. As a Dao integration stage demonic beast, it was nothing. In fact, there were even ancestors of its lineage in the primordial chaos.Also, the ancestor of the ancestor!Cang Mao and Tian Gou were the two great emperors who were on par with each other in the past. Among them, Tian Gou was the ancestor of his ancestor.His ancestor was the demon subduing envoy of the new martial era, and he didn't know if he had entered the venerable sovereign level.The Black Panther felt very sad when it thought of itself ... A mere Dao integration expert. In fact, it didn't really want to open a Stargate. Once it did, Li Hao might abandon them.Even if it wasn't considered abandoned, would a venerable sovereign still have to be imprisoned in the Silvermoon world?Li Hao was also observing the Stargate.He didn't say anything about Heibao's arrival. The others were afraid of disturbing him, but Heibao knew that Li Hao wasn't actually training. He was just thinking about his daily routine before every battle, including thinking about the future.There were some things that were not suitable to be said to people, but they could be said to dogs.A man and a dog looked up at the sky and the Stargate. A red mist had dyed the entire sky. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "I'm walking too fast, you guys are too slow!" "I actually wish to stop and wait for you guys," Li Hao said softly."But the Silvermoon world is too small, and I've taken most of the opportunities. If you wait any longer, you guys won't have much of a chance."There were only so many opportunities in the world. After giving birth to him and two more great Dao Masters, Silvermoon's Foundation was almost completely exhausted.If they didn't open the Stargate, these people might be stuck at the Dao integration realm for the rest of their lives.The only way was to open the Star Gate!He had wanted to wait for everyone, but later he realized that it was wishful thinking on his part. It was useless to wait. No wonder in the new martial era, the foundation of the great world still made countless people leave behind.It couldn't be helped, the world was only that big!"Woof!""You still can't talk? It's actually pretty good ... You can say it, but you can keep it in!"Li Hao chuckled. This dog had already reached the Dao integration stage.For such a powerful demonic beast to be unable to speak ... Don't you think it's strange?"When I wandered around new martial arts, I actually met your ancestor, the demon subduer. Actually ... It didn't know how to speak at first. Later, I found out that it actually knew how to speak, but its voice and even mental power were baby-like, so it was unwilling to speak. You inherited the characteristics of your ancestors, so you're not talking?"Heibao looked at him innocently."My cat and my dog are both very powerful ... Are you feeling inferior?"The Black Panther drooped its head a little.He was feeling inferior."You're too young!"Li Hao laughed,"how many years of Foundation do they have?" Your ancestor was only a half-step sovereign before the disappearance of the new martial arts ... He was equivalent to a ninth level Dao integration expert, which was not too far from you. In less than two years, he went from a mortal dog to a daomerge ... That's quite impressive!""Woof!"The Black Panther cried out.Li Hao turned his head and saw that the Black Panther was still unwilling to give up.This dog ... He had brought him all the way from his hometown in the silver Blizzard city to this day. He had helped him many times, so he still had feelings for him. However, the Dao integration realm was his limit, and even Li Hao would find it difficult to reverse this.He didn't really understand the Dao of the demon race.Yuan Shuo and Liu Long had also barely reached the Dao integration realm, but this had been a result of their deaths. Apart from Li Hao, the only ones who had survived and left the silver Blizzard city were black Panther, who was still at the first level of Dao integration.The rate of improvement was getting slower and slower. It was not even as fast as the other humans.This time, the others didn't disturb him, but the Black Panther came. Perhaps it was because Li Hao didn't give it any tasks or make it do anything, which made the Black Panther a little depressed. All this while, whenever they encountered great danger, Black Panther would actually put in a lot of effort.From the first time he left the Silver Moon to the eastern continent to deal with the Xu family.

Chapter 2547 Opening A Stargate (2)
After that, to devouring heaven's will and dealing with desolate beasts, it had done its best. But today, it was useless.Black Panther was not willing to accept this!Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther cried out for a while and looked at Li Hao expectantly. It seemed to know that Li Hao had a way to help it become stronger ... So it came to try its luck.It understood Li Hao!Li Hao's head ached. He scratched his head."It's useless even if you call me. I don't know what you're talking about. Are you saying that you're going to sleep?" Then go!""Woof woof woof woof!"The Black Panther was howling!It wasn 't!You understand!Li Hao laughed in spite of himself. He looked at the sky and suddenly said,"Gou 'Zi, you're really not afraid of death! I don't understand. If humans can be satisfied with their current situation, can't dogs be? In the Silvermoon Goblin clan, you're the well-deserved boss. What more do you want? what's the point of being stronger?"He showed his winding river and pointed to a cat deep in the sea."Did you see that? Those who raise pets ... Actually don't have a good ending, and that's the case for pets. When the owner dies, no one will care about the pet ... In the end, there's only sadness left!"Heibao did not care.It knew Li Hao. It barked again. It didn't want to be completely forgotten and left behind ... As for Li Hao, he laughed again,"alright, actually, if you don't come, then forget it!" Now that you're here ... I have some ideas!"Li Hao looked at it and thought, Silver moon's location will definitely be exposed this time! Silver Moon himself is actually swimming, but he's too slow. If we're exposed this time, we'll be swallowed up sooner or later!""Even if neo martial arts exists ... I can't judge the situation of neo martial arts. That human King is not a kind person. He has provoked strong enemies everywhere. In my opinion, he may provoke strong enemies from all walks of life!""He may not have the time or energy to care about us all the time ... Besides, it's better to rely on yourself than on others!""We can't always pin our hopes on someone else. Right now, Silver Moon is in seclusion. It's right and wrong. At least it's relatively safe. But if you don't have enough time to open the door to the world ... You'll find that there are bandits everywhere!""A medium-sized world without a venerable sovereign and a great Dao universe ... Any expert will be tempted. Don't think about the kindness of others!"Li Hao continued,"I was wondering if I could do something through some means ... But I was worried that it would cause big trouble! After thinking about it, you're actually the most suitable! It's just that ... It's not good to say it, and it's not good to force it!"Heibao seemed to have understood as his eyes glowed."You're a smart dog," Li Hao said with a smile."You probably understand what I mean, right?"Black Panther nodded his head frantically."That's right," Li Hao said in distress."You've inherited some of the abilities of the heavenly Hound and the demon subduing envoy, devouring the world! But ... You're too weak. I wanted you to swallow the Silver Moon and take it away, and even take away the two Dao universes ... But you're too weak!"Too weak, too weak! First level of Dao integration!To be able to devour a medium-level world and a newly-born dual-Dao universe, one had to be at least a venerable sovereign. However, the other party was only at Dao integration. The gap was too great.Even if it had the ability to devour, it would be useless. There were two possibilities. One was that it was impossible to devour it, and the other was that it would explode!But if Silvermoon didn't take him with him ... He'd just stay here. Could it be that he'd have to defend this place?At that time, even if there was movement at new martial and everyone's attention was attracted, this place would definitely attract the attention of some strong people. According to the celestial pole, the existence in the chaos, those lone travelers, could actually be killed one by one!Why?The so-called Chaos Rangers had two situations. One was that their own world had been destroyed and they had no choice but to wander alone. These lone travelers often broke into a world for resources. They were actually bandits.Another possibility was that some powerhouses from some top-tier great worlds who came out for adventures actually took on the identity of bandits ... The concept of the law of the jungle was vividly reflected in this Dark Universe! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It was the same for neo martial. From Heaven's Fate's mouth, they were not so afraid. They directly and clearly told Li Hao that neo martial was also a Bandit ... All the major worlds were bandits!Because, if you don't become a Bandit, you will only be robbed!The more famous you are, the worse your reputation will be, and only then will you be able to intimidate everyone!The Crimson Moon world was notorious because the other party was strong enough. In fact, neo martial was not too bad. As for why the Crimson Moon attacked neo martial, it was because there were many neo martial bandits. The Crimson Moon knew that this was a big fat piece of meat.However, Silver Moon ... Was currently not even comparable to an ordinary small world. In everyone's eyes, he was a big piece of fat meat!A difficult choice!The Black Panther listened attentively. It now understood Li Hao's concerns. Indeed ... It was too weak. Even if Li Hao had such thoughts, it was too difficult. How could a Dao integration dog swallow a middle-level world and a double-Dao universe?What Li Hao meant was for Gou 'Zi to swallow it and take the world to the chaos like the old cat!In an instant, Black Panther was extremely dejected.Yes, I can't do it.It was too difficult!As for Li Hao, he touched his chin and said softly,""So, I've thought about it for a long time, and it's not like I don't have a solution ...""Woof!"Heibao panicked. Stop keeping me in suspense, just tell me!How anxious!Li Hao patted the dog's head and said with a smile,""What's the hurry? you can't eat hot tofu if you're impatient!"

Chapter 2548 Opening A Stargate (3)
"That day, I said that you would replace the will of heaven ... Now that Silver Moon has no will of heaven, she wants to be the Queen, but she doesn't dare to because she's afraid that I'll kill her ... So, she's been hesitating and doesn't dare to mention it ... Actually, I don't want her to be the will of heaven either. It's too dangerous. This woman ... Has quite the ambition!"Then, Li Hao added,"I'm not afraid of ambitious people, but it's heaven's will. Fairness and justice are the best. Human beings 'desires are too great, far greater than demons'. Where there are people, there's a world of martial arts!""Woof?"Black Panther was puzzled. Did he mean that he was the will of the heavens? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  That wouldn't do either, heaven's will was inside and not outside!"This is what I'm thinking. You'll replace heaven's will, and when the world is advancing, you'll merge your two DAOs and envelop the Silver Moon! This is the best time for you to replace the will of the heavens!""This is one of the reasons. Replacing heaven's will can only allow one to control heaven and earth internally, but not the world outside!""Second ... This depends on luck, strength, and luck!"Li Hao said in a deep voice, there must be a Chaos Beast in the outside world that I can kill! Killing a Chaos Beast can actually devour a world. If there is one, and I can kill it, you can use your identity as the Heaven's Will to control the corpse and use it to devour the world. It will be very easy!""But there are a few difficulties. First, there must be a Chaos Beast! Second, the biggest difficulty for the corpse to be complete was that the internal structure of the Chaos Beast could not be destroyed, or it could not devour the world! "Third, your dog body might have to be abandoned, and you can only control this corpse and the Silvermoon world ... If the Chaos Beast you take is not a dog ... Then you are not a dog. Of course, you can try to slowly modify it!""Fourth, the Silver Moon world has no heaven's will, so it's not too troublesome. There's still one more difficulty, the dual Dao universe! The universe of the great path originated from the Silver Moon, but it also transcended the Silver Moon. With you, there might be a three-sided palm! Can you fight against those two? If you can't win ... If these two fight with you, you'll probably be devoured in the end ... Of course, the premise is that I'm no longer around. " The Black Panther wagged its tail and didn't pay much attention to it. What it cared about was whether it could become stronger.Li Hao understood what it meant. He smiled and said,""Of course you will become stronger, very strong, similar to the Chaos Beast ... Although I don't know if you will succeed, from now on, your achievements will be limited, and you will not be able to transcend the limits of the world! If silver Moon advances, then you can advance. If silver Moon can't advance ... Then you can't advance!""This is actually a type of seed world!"Li Hao and Heibao talked a lot.Black Panther nodded and felt that it was not bad. If he relied on himself, when would he become a venerable sovereign?According to Li Hao's words, if he could replace heaven's will, devour the world, and turn the Silver Moon into a world in his stomach, he would be a venerable sovereign!The chaos beasts were almost all venerable sovereigns.This could also be considered an alternative world Lord!Of course, the master of the world was not the master of the great path. In some worlds, there were Masters of the great path and also masters of the world. The neo martial world was like this. Of course, the human king and emperor Cang were both considered half a master of the world and half a master of the great path.Although the Silver Moon was small, it could be clearly distinguished.The Heaven's Will was the master of the world, and there were two masters of the great Dao, a total of three.If Li Hao was included, there were four of them."Gou 'Zi, you don't have any objections?"Black Panther nodded. Of course, he had no opinion. "What a pity!""No." Li Hao shook his head."I was thinking that if I had the chance, I would make you the will of my time world ..."Black Panther's eyes lit up!Really?Although the current time realm was not as good as Silver moon's or even ordinary small worlds, or Li Hao would have become a venerable sovereign long ago, he would advance sooner or later.This was the first reason. The second reason was that Li Hao actually had a better future than Silver Moon.This was what Black Panther thought.Li Hao laughed again."I'm just joking. Don't take it seriously. I make the decisions in my world. I don't want to create a God's will ... You can forget about it!"Alright!Instantly, Black Panther was dejected and somewhat helpless. However, he was cursing in his heart,"who says you are the master of your world?"Didn't you merge that woman's star of the great path?Really ... He had forgotten about the dog when he had a woman.Li Hao patted its head and said with a smile,""Then it's settled! After I kill the experts in the outside world, you can quickly turn it into heaven's will! I'll kill the chaos behemoth as soon as I get my hands on its corpse. You swallow the world, and we'll run away quickly!"He took the world and ran!This place was very dangerous. Perhaps it was really within the radiation range of the Crimson Moon world. Li Hao did not have the confidence to face this great world. Those who could compete with neo martial were definitely not people that the current Silver Moon could match.Black Panther kept nodding his head with joy on his face.Finally, he didn't come in vain!It knew that as long as you went to find Li Hao, Li Hao usually wouldn't refuse ... Just like that woman who took the initiative to find Li Hao and told him that she wanted to be his wife ... Even Li Hao didn't refuse.Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't reject any of your requests ... As long as he was willing."What are you still doing here? while you're still a dog, find some other dogs and play with them. Don't regret it."“……”The Black Panther was speechless. What kind of joke was this? I'm the number one dog in Silver Moon, why would I take a fancy to other dogs?However, he knew that Li Hao was chasing him away, so he could only turn around and leave.Li Hao was left alone in the small courtyard.

2549 Chapter 424
……After the Black Panther left, Li Hao looked at the small courtyard and exhaled.""I'm sorry ... I didn't want to destroy the residence of the sword Saint, nor did I want to do this ... However, I won't be pretentious with you guys anymore! This small courtyard ... Can you lend it to me?"As soon as he finished speaking, the long river circled around him. In an instant, countless sword Qi condensed in the small courtyard, directly converging into the sword intent left behind by li daoheng.The true sword essence of longevity began to converge!After losing the longevity sword intent, the small courtyard instantly became ordinary. Only the plaque remained.Li Hao didn't let go of the sign, either. He glanced at it and smiled.""Senior human King, please ... Lend me this plaque! There's no need to worry when there's a lot of lice. Neo martial arts is bound to have many strong enemies. When I leave Silver Moon ... And have the ability, I'll give back a little!"That was what he said, but whether he could do it or not, that would depend on the future.The neo martial human King was extremely powerful, but he also had a flaw. His comprehension of the great Dao was not deep. Although he was at the peak of his limit now, who knew what would happen in the future?Let's just wait and see!Besides, even if he was always at the peak, it was a good thing to have one more helper, wasn't it?Li Hao thought to himself that he no longer had any pressure to take the plaque away.This move was also copied from the human King.As long as he could get by ... That was enough.He also knew that this time, it would be extremely dangerous and would not be easy to overcome. The chaos lightning tribulation, time tribulation, future tribulation, and world advancement tribulation had all gathered together!If it could be easily resolved, then it would not be an additional tribulation!He had to make use of everything within Silver Moon.In the end, Li Hao looked at the Stargate in the sky. This Stargate ... Seems pretty good. How about ... After I open the Stargate, I destroy the Stargate as well?Not only that, a sword appeared in his hand.""Go, devour all the ancient ruins within the Silvermoon world! These ruins could exist between heaven and earth and resist the pressure of heaven and earth. They were considered divine weapons in themselves! This time, we have to use everything we can!"The firmament sword trembled slightly and disappeared instantly.Aside from the eight main cities, there were actually quite a few ancient ruins in Silver Moon.These were all created by neo martial in the past. They had a deep foundation and could be considered treasures. They could resist the pressure of heaven and earth and were not simple. Now, the firmament sword could devour them and increase their strength a little.Although it was insignificant, it was worth it for Li Hao.This time, no matter how he prepared, he would not let it go!He wanted nothing more than to make use of everything that Silver Moon had. The plaque was also taken down by Li Hao. The plaque didn't move much. As Li Hao exerted some strength, the plaque gradually shrank to the size of a palm and was hung around Li Hao's neck.A human King's calligraphy should be able to resist a venerable sovereign's attack, right?Even without the Taoist connotation, it was not easy for ordinary people to break into it. The reason why the small courtyard was not destroyed before was related to this plaque.As he withdrew his sword intent and took down the plaque ... The entire courtyard suddenly began to weather rapidly, gradually turning into dust!…… Below.Heaven's Fate looked up and was speechless. He took a deep breath. F * ck, you're so brave!You've destroyed the little courtyard of the sword Saint.If you really meet a human King in the chaos, you'll be beaten up even if you're from the Silver Moon. I hope you don't meet one, or you'll start to doubt your life.I don't even dare to do that!Even though I know that the plaque in the courtyard is actually quite useful.As he was thinking, a sword suddenly flew over at high speed. In an instant, it swallowed the divine Hall he was in. Even the celestial pole was stunned. He looked at the small sword. The small sword trembled and the tip of the sword pointed at the sky! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It wasn't me!As for why he chose this place first ... It couldn't be helped. A half-step sovereign had lived here for 100000 years. This place was truly a treasure land. It was absolutely awesome!Heaven's Fate gritted his teeth.This is too much!I've lived here for so many years, and you've eaten me?He didn't even leave a place to sleep. How ruthless.Of course, it was also obvious that Li Hao was under great pressure. Otherwise, he wouldn't have searched the entire world and even taken away his own residence.……At the same time.In the central continent.Suddenly, a palm descended from the sky.Below the ground, in a building, everyone except for one person was turned into dust in an instant. Their energy dissipated between heaven and earth, and white saint's face turned pale.Li Hao's voice resounded."Something is about to happen to Silver Moon. It's enough for us to have fun. Let's kill these scourges first!"He lowered his head, bowed down, and worshipped Sage white.He didn't say a word and didn't dare to have any thoughts.The insignificant thoughts in his mind vanished in an instant. In Li Hao's eyes, the Holy white cult was indeed destroyed in an instant today. Coincidentally, he had destroyed them all with a single palm, so he was too lazy to distinguish and search for them one by one.Ninety-nine percent of the evildoers in the world had been recruited by Sage Chaobai. This existence who had casually placed a piece on the board that day had some ability. He had really recruited countless evildoers. Among the population of ten billion people, there were still many evildoers."Continue to be the master of your sacred religion ... Continue to recruit villains from all over the world ... No era will lack these people. The more dangerous the situation is, the more there will be no shortage! I'll come and harvest a batch at a fixed time!"Sage Chaobai wanted to cry, but no tears came out. This person ... Was really ruthless.You've already come to this point, do you really care about a little bit of villainy?
