        patrolman's small building had a total of six floors.
        Hou Xiaochen was on the sixth floor.
        Hao lianchuan's office was on the fifth floor, which also had the offices of the other four deputy ministers. Li Hao recognized two of the other four, the metal department's Zhou Department and the water department's he Department.
        However, these people usually didn't stay in the headquarters.
        Hao lianchuan was the first assistant. If hou Xiaochen didn't manage things, he would be the main person in charge. So, the fifth floor was actually his permanent residence.
        Hao lianchuan and Li Hao went upstairs and said,""You've seen the first floor, it's a reception hall. In the archives room on the second floor. The third floor was the finance room. The Secretary and driver rest on the fourth floor, and the offices are on the fifth and sixth floors ..."
        Li Hao felt a little strange when he heard this arrangement.""What about the others?"
        No wonder the place was so small.
        Files, finance, Secretary, department head's office, other than these, there was nothing else here?
        "They each have their own missions. Don't tell me the night patrollers stay at home every day?"
         Hao lianchuan laughed."Whitemoon city has a lot of things to do and a lot of people. The night patrolmen have to go on patrol and so on. This is the office area of the headquarters. If the night patrolmen have nothing to do, they can go home or go to the inspection Office. The inspection Office also has a place for the night patrolmen to rest. The management at the headquarters isn't very strict, and you don't need to clock in to work. I heard that you clock in to work every day in Silver City. It's duoqi's fault!"
        They were all supers, so who would be willing to be restricted?
        Therefore, the management of the night watchmen was actually very lax.
        Other than emergency missions, Li Hao, who only needed to complete some regular missions, was a strange existence in the entire Night Watcher system.
        Alright!
        Li Hao didn't say anything. The blizzard Silver city's night patrollers were still very loyal to their duties. They stayed in the law enforcement building every day. Almost no one would go home, so going home here was a normal occurrence.
        After walking for a while, they reached the fifth floor.
        When she walked out of the stairwell, at first glance ... It really wasn't big.
        There were only a few offices on the entire floor, nothing else.
        Li Hao looked at the other offices. Only one seemed to be occupied, and the rest were empty.
        Hao lianchuan's office was at the end of the floor.
        As he led Li Hao inside, Hao lianchuan pointed to the sky and said,""Hou bu's office is upstairs. He takes up an entire floor. His place is much more luxurious than mine. There's even a resting room. I don't have one."
        "We, the silver Blizzard city's Nightwatchers, have nine people and one building!" Li Hao said in a low voice, embarrassed.
        I really pity you!
        His office in the Silver City had its own lounge.
        Poor Hao bu, even his office was so small.
         It's not even as big as the one I had in Silver City!  Hao lianchuan laughed."Every inch of land in white moon City is worth an inch of gold. Save it. After all, we don't have enough funds." Silver City is 3000 star dollars per square meter. This kind of house is considered high-end. In white moon City, adding a zero, it's exactly 10 times!"
        30,000 per square meter?
        Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.""So expensive, no wonder our headquarters is so small."
        The average salary in Silver City was more than a thousand points a month.
        They had to work for three years before they could buy a house here. Nowadays, they couldn't even afford a house.
        After saying that, Li Hao entered the office and said,""Hao bu, when I was in the Silver City, I was a patrol. Of course, it was only a low-level patrol. Logically speaking, I should be promoted by one rank after coming to the White moon City, right? Is it a high level patrol envoy or a City Patrol envoy?"
        In fact, Hao lianchuan was not in a good mood. He walked to his desk on his own.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He glanced at Li Hao and sighed after a long while."Are you pretending, or are you serious?"
        Li Hao laughed."What's there to pretend about? of course I'm serious!"
        Promotion? why not?
        Still acting, what's there to act about?
        "To be honest, night watchers don't really care about ranks," Hao lianchuan said, speechless.
        "That's because they're ignorant!"
        Li Hao didn't hold back,"rank is very important!" Today, the dynasty was still the dynasty, and the nine divisions were still the nine divisions. As long as the dynasty existed, the nine divisions would exist. The ranks that were not important in everyone's eyes were extremely important! The hierarchy in the dynasty is very strict. As a patrol envoy, you're going against a City Patrol envoy. You're going against your superior ... Even if you're powerful, it's still the same. It's up to others to see if they care. "
        "By the same logic, if an inspector were to go against me, even if I kill him with a single punch ... I can still report this matter to the various departments in the dynasty. This person has committed insubordination and should be killed. Not only am I not guilty, but I'll also be rewarded!"
         "As long as the dynasty still recognizes this rule and hasn't collapsed, there's no reason for it to find trouble with me ... The premise is that we're still in this system!"
        Hao lianchuan laughed. This time, he really laughed.
        He gestured for Li Hao to sit down, nodded, and said with a smile,""Good idea! I have to say, it's very reasonable, but now, people look at fists more than strength. "
        "That's because we're still at the stage of fighting and killing. "
        Li Hao also smiled."When the day comes that things are peaceful again," he said,"it will gradually integrate into the system."
        "You little brat, you're really a fan of being an official ..."
        Hao lianchuan was smiling very happily at the moment. Li Hao could be very interesting sometimes.
        "Then tell me, what do you want?"
        "City Patrol!"
        Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony."There are two ranks of patrollers. The first rank is low-level patrollers like Minister Liu Long, Huang Yun, senior Huang, and the others. The second rank is high-level patrollers like you. I'll just take a low-level City Patrol ... In this case, in terms of status, no one in the entire Silver Moon Inspection Office has a higher status than me, except for the six ministers. "
       
        Out of the six ministers, five of them were advanced envoys.
        As for hou Xiaochen, he was an even higher level of existence.
        At this level, they were called the provincial governor in the inspection Division system. They were in charge of the safety of a province and the people of the province.
        At this level, he could be considered a Governor.
        In all of Silver Moon, only the brains of the four major organizations were at this level.
        Hao lianchuan just looked at Li Hao.
        This kid was thinking too much.
        He looked at Li Hao for a while and laughed."It's not that you can't be a City Patrol. Under normal circumstances, the basic requirement is to be either a thousand-Star Warrior or a sunshine warrior. Liu Long was an exception. He was the head of a city in the silver Patrol city, so he made an exception to be promoted."
        "How about you?"
        He looked at Li Hao, who smiled and said,"I think I can fight with Wang Ming from riyao."
         "You!"
        Hao lianchuan chuckled."Alright, I'll write you a report. This requires the department head's approval. I don't have the right to do so."
        As expected, Wang Ming was right.
        If she had something to ask of Hao lianchuan, he might not be able to get it done, but he would agree to almost everything.
        In any case, he could just push all the blame onto hou Xiaochen.
        Hao lianchuan didn't continue the topic and said,""You've guessed something about Hu dingfang, haven't you?"he asked.
        "Yes, my Senior Sister, his wife, right?"
        p "Smart!"  Hao lianchuan nodded,"so what do you think?" Your Senior Sister is actually doing well in the Tiger wing Army. Hu dingfang still relies on her and listens to her. She hopes that you will be safer in the Tiger wing Army. "
        "To be honest, it is indeed safer, unless the Tiger wing Army is destroyed."
        "Yes," Hao lianchuan said."But if you join the Tiger wing Army, you'll be like a little bird raised at home. Your Senior Sister ... To be honest, she doesn't understand martial masters!" She's very talented, but she's not a true Martial Master. She doesn't understand that once a Martial Master is kept in captivity, more than half of them will be crippled!"
        "Do you want to go?" Hao lianchuan asked seriously.
        "I don 't!"
        Li Hao shook his head. After thinking for a moment, he said,""Besides, teacher never asked me to find any Senior Sister. Hu dingfang's five birds breathing technique was not taught by teacher, but by Senior Sister herself. This is already against the rules of the martial arts world! The reason why I didn't clean up the house is probably because teacher can't bear to be ruthless ... How can I disagree with teacher's opinion at this time?"
        "I've guessed it,"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan got up and opened the window. A cool breeze blew past and he let out a breath of air.
        "I'll ask you one more time. Do you want to become a superhuman, or do you want to continue on the path of a Martial Master? this will also help you with your future arrangements."
        "The Martial Master path!"
        "My teacher is a spiritual accumulation Martial Master," Li Hao said straightforwardly."If I don't become a spiritual accumulation Martial Master, I won't consider becoming a super."
        "That's good!"
        Hao lianchuan laughed."Your specific arrangements will depend on Minister hou. I'm just giving you a hint in advance. If you insist on walking the path of a Martial Master, there's a high probability that you will go to the Wei Wu Army. The people there are all martial masters!"  "Let's put this aside for now. Also, many people want to see you. Do you have any thoughts?"
        Li Hao thought for a while."We can arrange a meet-and-greet for martial masters. We can invite some martial masters who have broken through the 100th level or the Dou Qian realm to meet. We don't need too many people. I'll answer some of their questions at my discretion. As for whether they believe me or not, I don't care."
        "Well, other than the Martial Master, there are also people who want to see you ..."
        "The administrative Bureau or the higher-ups?" Li Hao asked.
        "The people above."
        Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"it's better not to offend the people above. It's probably because of the eight great families, but I'm not too sure about this ... I can meet them, but I need someone to accompany me to meet them. Chief Yu!"
        "I can 't?"
        "Why do you need chief Yu to accompany you?" Hao lianchuan laughed in anger.
        Li Hao didn't speak.
        Because you are too weak!
        Li Hao didn't want to guess what the outcome would be when the higher-ups wanted to see him. He only needed to know that at the critical moment, chief Yu, Xu Guang, was very powerful. That was enough.
        He had the confidence to turn hostile.
        As for Hao lianchuan ... He might not have that kind of confidence.
        As for Hao lianchuan, he thought about it and suddenly laughed. After a while, he said,""Li Hao, you're quite quick-witted. I was thinking that you wouldn't know how to deal with these situations since you're new here. It seems that you've already thought about it."
        Li Hao nodded.
        That's for sure!
        Besides, he wasn't too worried about hou Xiaochen.
        Even if everyone wanted to eat him, they would have to see hou Xiaochen's reaction.
        "Hao bu, when can I meet hou bu?" Li Hao asked.
        "Why are you in such a hurry?"
         "If you have something to say to the Marquis, the Hao battle...Might not be able to make the decision."
        Hao lianchuan laughed in anger."Tell me. What can't I make the decision?"
        "Too much!"
        Li Hao didn't hold back at all."I didn't have many requests in coming to white moon City. I'm not qualified to have any requests." But since you asked me to come to white moon City, it can't be for me to be a bystander. You also said that martial masters aren't raised in captivity!"
        "So, I have my own thoughts."
        "First, I want the power of law enforcement!"
        Li Hao said calmly,"I have the right to enforce the law on all supers and martial masters who are not part of the Nightwalker system. If I feel that the other party is a threat to me and the stability of society, I have the right to kill them. The entire Nightwalker system has to bear the consequences, not just me!"
        Law-enforcement power!
        Hao lianchuan's eyes flickered.
        "Second, I need immunity! "Simply put, in the entire system, the official system, other than the night watchers, the Marquis and Hao tribes, no one else has the right to interfere with me or to punish me! I have the right to not listen to any orders other than the two ministers!"
       
        "Third, I need to match my authority as a City Patrol. According to the rules of the inspection Office and the night patrols, in the event of an emergency, I have the right to mobilize all the personnel of the inspection Office and the night patrols around me. As long as they are of a lower or the same rank as me, I have the right to mobilize and order them under the temporary combat supervisor!"
        Hao lianchuan remained silent.
        He didn't expect that Li Hao would ask for three rights ... But this wasn't something he could decide. Only hou Xiaochen could give him an answer.
        He frowned,'I thought that you would choose to keep a low profile when you came here, or even if you do something, you would do it in secret. But from what you're saying, you seem to have other thoughts?"
        Li Hao nodded."Of course I have some ideas. I can't just be a decoration. Although I'm low-key, I'm low-key because I have the confidence. I don't have the confidence, so I need the Department to give me some confidence."
        "Do you think the Marquis will agree?"
        Hao lianchuan laughed."I don't have any objections. But you're asking for power the moment you arrive. Why?"
        "On what basis?"
        Li Hao thought for a moment, then said,""Because I have something that hou bu values. Hou bu transferred me here, partly because of my teacher, and partly because of myself!"
        You?
         Hao lianchuan fell into deep thought.
        Li Hao ... Has he already reached the Qian warrior realm?
        If he had advanced to the thousand warrior tier and Li Hao knew the method of accumulating spirit, perhaps this guy would have had a chance to do so soon.
        Of course, Hao lianchuan did not care too much about stepping into the universe.
        However, if he reached the spirit accumulation stage, even if he was far inferior to Yuan Shuo, Li Hao would also possess the power of three suns. This was not to be underestimated, as a spirit accumulation Martial Master was much more valuable than a three-sun Martial Master.
        "Fine, I will also pass on this message to the Marquis!"
        Hao lianchuan repeated.
        "You're interesting," he said with a smile."I thought you might not be willing to help me with a small matter, but it seems like it won't be a problem."
        "Does Hao bu need my help?"
        Li Hao suddenly showed a troubled expression.""I'm weak ..."
        "Wait!"
        Hao lianchuan waved his hand and said,"let me finish!" What I need now is your superb acting skills and your honest expression. You'll look like an honest person, a young man who has never seen the world. "
        Li Hao was embarrassed. Who are you talking about?
        Hao lianchuan continued,"Whitemoon city isn't peaceful now!" Some people are always looking for trouble. I need you to help me solve the trouble caused by these people. "
        Li Hao hesitated and said,"me?" What should I do?"  "Simple!"
        Hao lianchuan chuckled."Just do a few things. First, you accidentally leaked some information. It's important, but don't finish it. It'll make people feel like they want to capture you and interrogate you!"
        "Second, you can pretend to be injured and innocent. For example, if someone runs into you on the road, wants to catch you, or you see someone staring at you ... You can use your acting skills to fish out the other party. Soon, the main force will arrive. You just need to act like you're injured, innocent, wronged ... We'll be in charge of catching and killing people!"
        "Remember, many people will watch your acting, such as the administrative Bureau, the higher-ups, the military ... Your acting is good, and no one will dare to say anything if we do something bad. But if you pretend to be fake, then you'll attract others "suspicion and anger."
        Hao lianchuan chuckled."I haven't been very happy recently. The Marquis killed Xuguang and he ran away, but he left behind too much mess. This makes me very uncomfortable!"
        Li Hao understood.
        He really understood!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He was a little surprised and looked at Hao lianchuan. Was he trying to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys?
        However, it didn't fit his usual honest and good person image, so he needed a reason, a guy who specialized in scamming others to cooperate with him.
        The premise was that the person's identity was very important, and they were weak and easy to bully.
        In this way, he would have a reason and a reason to clean up a group of people, and no one would care about him, because even honest people would be angry.
        "Hao bu, are you sure you can handle this?"
        Li Hao looked at him. Can you?
        You're only at the early stage of the three yang realm. You can deal with some weak people, but are your targets only weak people?
         Hao lianchuan sneered,"I'll still hold onto the fire Phoenix spear!" As long as it wasn't Xuguang, anyone would do! Kid, don't look down on the three suns. Besides, you're just over a hundred. Do you have the right to look down on the three suns? Even if you're a cheater, you'd better keep a low profile!"
        What are you pretending for!
        With who?
        Li Hao frowned and hesitated.""Hao bu, does the hou tribe know about this?"
        "It doesn't matter if he knows or not. He won't care."
        Hao lianchuan sighed,'when it comes to a critical moment, I'll just take the blame! To be honest, it's not easy to find such a person. If an ordinary person shows up, it's easy to be suspected of entrapment ... You're different, you look innocent and honest. I like bad people like you who look like good people!"
        “……”
        Li Hao felt wronged.
        Hao lianchuan laughed and said,"that's right. That's it. You look like you've been wronged!" Of course, it's not that there are no benefits. The benefit is that I'll help you fight for the few things you mentioned before! In addition, I'll give you a list of people you can't touch. You can choose anyone you want from the rest!"
        "Hao bu, what if you're late and I'm really killed?"
       
        "Not necessarily. Ordinary people wouldn't dare to do that. Besides, what's the point of killing you? you can reveal some information so that people won't kill you and only want to capture you alive. I believe you can do it!"
        Li Hao sighed.
        However, he still fought for it. ""Sure, but I don't think Hao bu has done anything for us. How about ... Giving us some other benefits? After all, it's a mission. "
        "Other benefits?"
        Hao lianchuan thought for a while and laughed."How about this? I'll tell the public that you're no different from my son. I've always thought highly of you in the Silver City. If anything happens to you in the future, I'll kill the other party's entire family to avenge you ... In name, I'll be your father!"
        “……”
        Go to hell!
        Of course, if Hao lianchuan really said something like that, it would be good for Li Hao. His status was not low, and he could even represent the night patrolman and his attitude.
        Although hou Xiaochen had killed a Xu Guang for Li Hao, the situation was different.
        A moment later, Li Hao nodded.
         It could be considered that he had agreed to this cooperation.
        Of course, Li Hao still couldn't help but ask,""What does the Marquis mean? I heard from Nan Quan that someone might be trying to force hou bu to do something irrational. If we do this now, will we fall into their trap?"
        "I won 't!"
        Hao lianchuan laughed."I've already said that this is our business. It's the duty of the night patrolmen ... So, you have to suffer a little. Otherwise, with the hou tribe's strength, they can just kill you!" Why was there a need to do so? Sometimes, rebellion and law enforcement were just a matter of expression ... If you killed someone forcefully, it would be a rebellion. You were forced to kill, that was law enforcement ... Do you understand?"
        Do you understand?
        He didn't really understand.
        But he understood the general meaning.
        Li Hao nodded.
        Hao lianchuan also let out a sigh of relief. He suddenly gritted his teeth and laughed."The first target is one of the three suns" night watchers. I've been annoyed with him for a long time! What you need to do is simple. Find a way to fish him up. We have to kill him before the others react! Let's kill him openly!"
        "Master Hao, you ... Aren't you a little too bold?" Li Hao was stunned and took a deep breath.
        "You even killed Zhang Ting," Hao lianchuan laughed."And you're still calling me bold?"
        "Hao bu is framing me?"
        "Whether it is or not, you know it yourself."
        Hao lianchuan raised his eyebrows and said,"cut the crap. Can you do it?" It's best if he secretly follows you, secretly following you, or even hiding his identity ... In this case, kill him openly! I want to let these guys know that the Savage Land in their eyes is not that easy to mess with!"
        Li Hao pondered for a while and nodded."Sure. But there's one thing. If he dies, the mystery will belong to me."
        "Alright!"
        Hao lianchuan agreed without hesitation. He was all smiles and was extremely happy.
        "By the way, I can't appear too quickly. You have to at least deal with him for a while. It's best if you can make some noise ... That's the best way to attract the attention of others. Then, I'll take the fiery phoenix spear and kill him with one shot!"
         After saying that, he asked,"is it difficult?" Are you confident?"  Li Hao chuckled."It's alright. Do I need to choose the location?"
        "There's no need for that. It's fine as long as there aren't many ordinary people. I'll just kill him with one shot. It should be very fast ..."
        Was he that confident?
        Li Hao glanced at him. In his eyes, this person's ball of light seemed to be a little bigger. Could he be at the middle stage of the three yang realm?
        But even if he was at the middle stage of the three yang realm, with the fire Phoenix spear in hand, could he kill a three yang so easily with one strike?
        To be honest, Li Hao didn't doubt hou Xiaochen's arrival.
        But Hao lianchuan ... It was hard not to doubt his strength.
        Li Hao began to wonder if hou Xiaochen knew what he was doing. It would be very troublesome to kill a high-level Night Watcher without careful consideration. Even if the other party's whereabouts were strange, it could cause some trouble.
        Of course, it has nothing to do with me!
        I'm an innocent victim!
        Thinking about it, Li Hao felt that it was very exciting. On his first day in the demon hunting squad, he had been used as bait.
        Now that they were in Whitemoon city, Hao lianchuan's intention was clear. He was still going to be bait.
        In fact, Li Hao quite liked it.
        So quiet and low-key ... What was the point of coming here?
        Of course, he had to find something to do, and it would be best if he could get some benefits or even personally participate in some battles. Only then would he have the opportunity to comprehend the other Shi.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He had been protected all this time. If hou Xiaochen had really stayed close to him to protect him, Li Hao would not have been happy.
        To be able to find trouble and get himself out of it was more in line with Li Hao's appetite.
         It could be said that the two of them hit it off!
        "Alright, let's stop here."
        Hao lianchuan continued,"I'll go and see if the Marquis has come out of seclusion. If he has, you can meet him. If he hasn 't, I'll think of a way to get your 5000 cubic meters reward. By the way, the Marquis means that the reward will be changed to the blood God from the Sunglow realm. Do you agree?"
        Li Hao raised his eyebrows.
        "Sure!" He quickly nodded.
        A sunguang-ranked Scion of the blood God ... He had thought that he would be able to take it for free, but it seemed that there was no hope.
        It's fine, it's fine to exchange for a blood shadow of the rising light realm.
        The current Li Hao needed this to strengthen his entire body.
        It was pretty good!
        The blood shadow could strengthen the body and internal strength. At this time, it was also a treasure that Li Hao urgently needed. His five internal organs were already very strong, but his body was still a little weak. He was also preparing to obtain some Thunder and wind mystic energy.
       
        The advantage of the blood shadow was that it consumed very little sword energy, unlike the mysterious energy that required a large number of swords to extract.
        The blood shadow did not even need sword energy to absorb and digest it.
        "That's all I have to say ... Also, I've thought about it for a while, and I've decided to arrange for your residence to be opposite mine. On the one hand, it'll be convenient for me to take care of you, and on the other hand, it'll make it easier for me to appear in front of you at any time without appearing out of place!"
        "Where's Hao bu's home?"
        "It's not too far. It's about 10 miles away from the night patrolman headquarters. It's very close. You're a Martial Master. If you walk, it'll be more than enough for half an hour. "
        Ten li was indeed not far.
        This 10-mile journey would also attract the attention and concern of many people. If they stayed in the headquarters all day long, even if they had the intention, they would not dare to act rashly.
        ……
        After talking to Hao lianchuan for a while, Li Hao walked down alone.
        Downstairs.
         Wang Ming was surrounded by quite a few people who were listening to him brag. This guy's strength in the sun glory realm had been completely exposed this time.
        Seeing Li Hao come downstairs, Wang Ming immediately smiled."Li Hao has come down. What did Hao bu do?"
        "I haven't made any arrangements yet. I'll make them after hou bu comes out of seclusion."
        Li Hao smiled."However, Hao bu said that to take care of me, I'll live opposite his house. Do you know the place, Mr. Wang?"
        "I know!"
        Wang Ming nodded."I've been there before. It's actually the family building of the inspection Division. We used to belong to the inspection Division, so it's a pretty good place and quite safe."
        At that moment, someone next to Wang Ming said,"Are you a relative of Hao bu, patrol li?"
        Li Hao laughed."No, but Hao bu went to the Silver City and has a good relationship with my master, so he took extra care of me. Plus, I'm in trouble now, so Hao bu took extra care of me. Please don't misunderstand!"
        "I'm new here," he said."I don't know anything about white moon City. When I've settled down, I'll treat you to a meal!"
        Li Hao was very polite and warm, and his smile was especially heartwarming.
        "We should be the ones to welcome you ... But you're really tired. We'll arrange it later!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com “……”
        Everyone was also chuckling. Almost all those who remained here were at the Dark Moon level, and the sun glory ones couldn't be seen. Wang Ming was the most powerful one.
        These Dark Moon night patrols did not know much.
        However, they also knew that Li Hao had been transferred over by hou bu and had a good relationship with him. He was also a good friend of Wang Ming, the newly promoted riyao ...
         As such, they were naturally more enthusiastic.  ……
        After exchanging some pleasantries in the hall, Li Hao and Wang Ming walked out together.
        Hao lianchuan met Li Hao in advance and left him alone.
        The female guard was still outside the door.
        "Patrol officer Li Hao, I'm ..." He hurriedly said when he saw Li Hao.
        "I'm sorry," Li Hao said before she could speak."Department head Hao said that I'm not allowed to communicate with anyone who's not a Night Watcher!" I'm currently in a half-controlled state. "
        After saying that, Li Hao continued to walk outside. He Yong was also at the gate, but he didn't come in.
        Other than He Yong, there were also some people at the entrance, but they didn't get close.
        Li Hao didn't say anything. He walked out of the door and said loudly,""Senior Nan, you don't have to follow me anymore. Minister Hao just said that we'll hold a press conference tomorrow, and all martial masters who have broken through 100% and douqian martial masters can directly participate! If you have any questions or need to know anything, I'll answer them all. As long as it doesn't involve the secret of the five birds, I will tell you everything about my master!"
        "The five birds faction also hopes that the path of martial masters can be carried forward. I won't hold anything back. If I can tell you, I'll definitely tell you!"
        After saying this, he said in a very bold voice,""In addition, other than the martial masters, if anyone has any doubts or needs to understand anything, you can apply through the night patrolman. As promised by the higher-ups, I will reply to everyone one by one!"
        Li Hao was very sincere."I'm new here. I haven't even eaten or found a place to sleep. Seniors, please give me some time. When I've settled down, I'll be able to answer your questions better."
        At this moment, the people outside the door were no longer in a hurry after hearing Li Hao's words.
        ? Finally, there was a specific time!
         However, someone still spoke up,"only martial masters?" Little friend li, some of us were forced to become supers in the past and are no longer martial masters. However, there are still martial masters among our disciples ... Now that the limit is set, we ..."
        Li Hao's face was full of sympathy and pity, but he quickly said in embarrassment,""I ... I can't make the decision. Seniors, you can ask the night patrolman. As long as the night patrolman agrees, I have no objections. I can't make the decision,"
        He was a little helpless and seemed to want to agree immediately.
        Seeing his expression, everyone also felt that there was no need to make things difficult for Li Hao. After coming here from the Silver City, this young man was probably panicking.
        For this matter, he still had to find the night patrol.
        At the very least, Li Hao was willing to say something, and that was enough.
        After saying this, Li Hao cupped his fists and said,""Then I'll go back first. Seniors, we'll meet again tomorrow!"
        He Yong of the southern Fist also glanced at Li Hao. As he looked at him ... He scratched his head.
        'This kid, why do I feel like he's changed?'
        Of course, there wasn't much of a change, but he could vaguely feel that this fellow wasn't that honest. From what he had said just now, he had a pitiful look on his face, but on the way here, he wasn't like that.
       
        Thinking about it, he didn't say anything.
        Since there was a press conference tomorrow, the others were not in a hurry.
        White moon City was still very safe at the moment. At least hou Xiaochen was still here, so ordinary people wouldn't dare to cause trouble in the city.
        ……
        A moment later, Li Hao and Wang Ming walked toward the residential area.
        Someone was following him!
        Of course, his whereabouts were well-hidden, so Li Hao didn't care.
        If a superhuman followed him, he would be a live target.
        The Martial Master had followed him. Li Hao felt that there were only a few martial masters in the city who could fight with him. Only seniors like Nan Quan had the opportunity to fight with him.
        Li Hao, whose five internal organs had been strengthened to this extent, could be considered the second level of the profound spirit, except for the fact that his force was weaker than his teacher 's. The only thing he was lacking was his force.
         "Li Hao, did Hao bu say anything? You didn't see the Marquis?"
        "No, I didn 't,"
        Wang Ming was a little regretful, but he didn't say much."Right, I'll send you back later. I have to go home! My home is in the west side of the city and this is the south side. I haven't gone home since I advanced to the sunlit stage. "
        He had to go home to show off and get some benefits at the same time. Last time, his family supported him with some mysterious energy to advance to full moon. Now that he was shining, of course he had to go back and get more things.
        "You've just arrived. Come to my house in a few days!"
        "My house is much bigger than my dormitory," Wang Ming said with a smile.
        Li Hao nodded and sent a voice transmission."After we go back, don't say things you shouldn't say. Don't be too big-mouthed!"
        “……”
        Wang Ming was startled.
        He glanced at Li Hao. Telepathy?
        Voice transmission was exclusive to the three suns, and only some senior douqian martial masters could do it.
        But ... But Li Hao had just advanced!
        He was a little stunned. What was going on with this guy?
        Did he become stronger again?
        Li Hao's expression did not change. Transmitting his voice felt great. Ever since his five internal organs had been strengthened to the level of 1000 cubic meters, he knew that he could use Secret Sound transmission. In fact, he just had to control some sound waves.
        It wasn't that complicated, but it required a strong control of inner strength. Otherwise, it was easy for the sound to leak out.
        This was also the reason why only three suns and Qian warrior could do it. Ordinary Qian warrior didn't have that much inner strength.
        Wang Ming didn't say anything. He wasn't stupid, and he knew that he couldn't just say everything.
        For example, how could he talk nonsense about killing Zhang Ting?
        Li Hao continued to walk and observe the environment.
        It was his first time here, and he was too unfamiliar with white moon City.
        As the night patrolman walked out, there were some old residential areas and streets on both sides. The southern city was considered a relatively old area, and there were not many high-rise buildings. The other areas, however, had more modern colors.
        The night watchmen were established late, and the good places had long been occupied by those organizations.
        ……
        At the same time.
        The news that the night patrolman was going to hold a press conference the next day also spread.
        All the powerful martial masters could participate. For a time, many martial masters were excited and extremely eager to obtain some methods to advance to the level of spirit accumulation.
        At the same time.
        East City.
         On the top floor of an extremely tall hotel.  It was an extremely luxurious suite with a living room, dining room, kitchen, dance hall ... It was so large that it took up nearly 1000 square meters, but there were only 5 people living there.
        At this time, the five of them were gathered in the living room.
        Four men and one woman.
        Apart from the green-haired Yu Xiao, there were three men left. One of them was a short-haired young man, Hu Qingfeng, who was also the leader of the five-man team.
        Yu Xiao's strength was the weakest. At this moment, he took the initiative to speak, "There's news from Hao lianchuan. He said that after Li Hao's press conference with the martial masters ends, he can have Li Hao come to see us ... But he hopes to go to the South City. It's Li Hao's first time here, and he's a little afraid of unfamiliar environments."
        In fact, they were not very willing to go to the southern city.
        The main reason was that the South City was hou Xiaochen's territory, unlike the East City, where the administrative Bureau was stationed. Under normal circumstances, hou Xiaochen wouldn't come here.
        "You're so timid?"
        Hu Qingfeng smiled and nodded."All right, then you go there tomorrow. Let Chen Min accompany you. It'll be best if you can bring Li Hao back. If not, there won't be any conflict ... Just take some blood samples from Li Hao."
        At this stage, there was no need to provoke hou Xiaochen. The administration hadn't done anything yet, and even if they wanted to, they'd need the support of some of the local officials.
        "Blood sample ... Will Hao lianchuan agree?"
        "This person is rather perfunctory ..." Yu Xiao said with a frown.
        "You do as you see fit!"
        Well, Yu Xiao didn't say anything more. It was just some blood samples. What was the difficulty?
        Hu Qingfeng continued,"Li Hao isn't part of the mission. The key is still hou Xiaochen!" Also, is that old man still unwilling to meet with the Silver Moon Army?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Among them, a middle-aged man who was slightly older said in a deep voice,""The Silver Moon Army said that their commander Yu's old injuries have acted up recently and he has been recuperating. I'm afraid he will need some time to recover."
        Hu Qingfeng's face turned pale. It was an old injury again!
        Hou Xiaochen's old injuries were acting up, so was the old Marshal 's, and even the inspector's Secretary said that he himself was acting up. Even director Zhao said that he wasn't feeling well and was coughing ...
        F * cking hell, were the leaders of the huge Silver Moon all sickly?
        Each and every one of them was using the same excuse!
        Either his old injuries were acting up, or he was in poor health, which made Hu Qingfeng extremely uncomfortable. Even in the central region, he would not have been treated like this. He had been shut out one after another!
        Xuguang was a god tier master blessed by the heavens.
        Other than the few freaks in the headquarters, he was also an eye-catching existence in the central region.
        Of course, those perverts did not usually stay in the headquarters. It was said that they had run out to cause trouble again a few days ago. No one knew how much trouble they would cause this time. The previous war in the central region was caused by those guys.
        Thinking of those few people, he also felt a little irritated.
        Those guys were good at finding trouble, but they were usually only responsible for finding trouble and not cleaning up the mess. They often brought countless troubles to them!
        "Then let's not care about him for now!"
        "Has there been any movement from the three major organizations recently?" Hu Qingfeng asked in a deep voice.
         "The king of equality is outside the city. There doesn't seem to be any news from the mountainside. As for the red moon, it's said that the Blue Moon has rushed over from the central region ..."
        Hu Qingfeng nodded slightly. After a moment of consideration, he said,"If necessary, we can have a talk with them. Hou Xiaochen is a thorn in their side, and silver Moon has a lot of secrets. This thorn in their side will make many people uncomfortable!"
        "Understood!"
        After a brief discussion, they were in no hurry to meet Li Hao. Everything could be discussed after the press conference tomorrow.
        They also wanted to see if there would be any secrets that would be leaked out.
        Was it difficult for a Martial Master to accumulate spirit?
        ……
        At this moment, everyone was silent and waiting.
        Li Hao's arrival also brought some minor waves to white moon City.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, was extremely relaxed. He was looking around in his new home, admiring the big light bulbs outside through the window. It was so bright!
       
        The house was not big.
        However, it was very clean. It was obvious that someone had cleaned up this place before. An ordinary two-bedroom apartment was about 70 to 80 square meters.
        However, in a place like white moon City where every inch of land was worth an inch of gold, it was already very good to be able to allocate one room per person.
        Across the street was Hao lianchuan ... This department head Hao actually only lived in this kind of place. It was unknown whether he was unwilling to move to a new house or because his status was really not good, but he could only be assigned here.
        Li Hao opened the window and felt the comfort of the breeze.
        He thought to himself, white moon City is still the best.
        So powerful!
        In such a small place, there were seven superpowers gathered nearby. How many martial masters were there that he did not know?
        The two earth elementalists were both hiding in the soil. He wondered if they would suffocate after a long time.
        A wind elemental turned into a breeze and floated in the air.
         There was one person with the invisibility power, probably a type of dark power, in the house directly opposite him.
        The other three were a little further away, and he didn't know if they had the ability of clairvoyance or clairaudience.
        Amazing!
        Seven superpowers from seven families?
        He had just arrived, and in the blink of an eye, he had been targeted by so many people. How interesting.
        Just as he was admiring the large light bulbs, someone knocked on the door.
        Li Hao tilted his head and looked. There were no orbs.
        He wasn't afraid and opened the door.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Outside the door, a woman in her thirties smiled and said warmly,""Is it patrol li? "I'm from the logistics department of the Patrol Division. I heard that patrol li has just arrived and is not familiar with the White moon City. The Patrol Division has some arrangements for all patrol envoys and above. If you need anything, just call us. If your clothes are dirty, we'll take care of them. As for traveling, do you like motorcycles or cars ...? As for food, there's a free canteen in the district. If you don't like it, you can also provide it ..."
        Li Hao was a little surprised. Such good treatment?
        The key point was that the night patrollers and the inspector were almost separated, but they could still enjoy the treatment of the inspector.
        A patrol envoy was considered a Big Shot in a small place.
        But in this place, it was nothing.
        Many moon nether rank existences held the position of inspector. Some of the sun glory existences were even advanced inspectors, but they didn't get promoted.
        The city Patrol was a little more impressive.
        "Okay, thank you. I just came and don't know anything. Sister, don't worry about me. When department head Hao comes back, I'll ask him for his opinion. Under normal circumstances, I'll eat with him ..."
        The woman's eyes lit up and she became even more enthusiastic."Alright, then I won't disturb you any further. Press 1 for the communication device in the room, and it'll be our logistics department's number. If patrol li needs anything, just tell me!"
        "You're too polite!"
        Li Hao was also very enthusiastic. He kept thanking her until she left reluctantly. Li Hao closed the door with a smile on his face, as if he was very happy.
        "That's good!"
         Li Hao chuckled, as if he was very satisfied.  He walked to the window again and looked down.
        They were on the 12th floor, which wasn't considered low. There wasn't much scenery outside the window, and the building in front blocked some of the view.
        However, the greenery in the neighborhood was not bad.
        When he arrived, it was already getting late. At this moment, the sky was getting dark. The sky was gradually turning dark, but Hao lianchuan, who was sitting opposite him, had not returned yet. It seemed that this Minister also had to work overtime. How pitiful.
        Hao lianchuan didn't return, but Li Hao wasn't in a hurry. He continued to wander around the house.
        The house was not big. There was a study room outside the two bedrooms.
        There were some books in the study.
        They were all Basic Books.
        Li Hao read for a while, then took some books and put some of the books he had brought on them ... He didn't bring much, but he had brought some books from the third row of the teacher's bookshelf.
        They were all part of his teacher's collection. His teacher liked them, and Li Hao was afraid that his teacher wouldn't be able to find them when he returned, so he had specially brought them for him.
        However, there seemed to be one book missing. It might have been taken away by the teacher.
        His teacher really loved books as much as his life. Even in such a dangerous situation, he still carried a book with him before the great battle ... How touching!
        Li Hao didn't bring anything else except some books.
        Things like clothes didn't need to be brought along for public expenses. When they reached the place, someone would naturally provide them.
        Other than the book, there was also a bank card.
        Several months 'worth of Li Hao's salary was stored in the card. He had been promoted last month, so his salary and bonus should be quite high. Li Hao felt that he might have tens of thousands of Yuan in his card.
        Tens of thousands of star dollars should be enough to treat them to a meal, right?
        After being busy for a while, there seemed to be some noise on the other side.
        Li Hao didn't look. Instead, he looked out of the window.
         A few light bulbs nearby had disappeared. Even the few light bulbs in the soil had disappeared. It seemed that these people were still afraid of the three suns. If he lived alone, these light bulbs would probably always be there.
        Li Hao gently exhaled. Although he liked to look at light bulbs, these light bulbs didn't leave. They were observing him even when he peed. It was very uncomfortable.
        "Dong Dong Dong!"
        There was a knock on the door.
        Li Hao hurriedly went to open the door. Hao lianchuan was a little tired. He looked around the room and nodded. "It's good that you've settled down. I'm usually with the night patrol, but I'll come back to sleep at night if I'm free."
        "Hao bu, have you eaten?"
        "No, you didn't eat either?"
        "No, I didn 't,"
        "Where's my Blood God?"Li Hao asked in a low voice.
        Hao lianchuan rolled his eyes and said,"there's no hurry. Tomorrow!" I've asked chief Yu, and he said that I'll probably be able to get it to you tomorrow. You'll probably be able to get it after the press conference tomorrow. "
       
        "Where is hou bu?" he asked.
        "I heard that his injuries have worsened. He has to go into seclusion for a few more days."
        Hao lianchuan and Li Hao laughed at the mention of their injuries.
        This injury was really serious.
        It's been a few days, and it's still not healed.
        Then, Hao lianchuan added,"I'll get someone to send some food over. By the way, your senior brother-in-law called just now. He said that it's okay if you don't want to go to the Tiger wing Army. You can look for him if you need anything."
        "You're so thoughtful!"
        Li Hao nodded. He was expressionless and appeared very indifferent.
        Hao lianchuan was a little curious."You're so shameless to flatter me. Why didn't you think of flattering him? if you're willing, he'll definitely help you more."
        "Hao bu isn't a Martial Master."
         Li Hao only said one sentence.
        Hao lianchuan immediately frowned.
        Li Hao didn't explain, nor did he say anything.
        You don't understand because you're not a Martial Master.
        Inheritances could not be randomly passed on, nor could they be randomly learned!
        Yuan Shuo wanted to learn the ninth-refinement force, but no matter if it was Li Hao or Liu Long, even if their relationship was very good ... Had they inherited it?
        Did Yuan Shuo teach Liu Long the breathing technique of five birds?
        Martial masters all followed some basic rules. If they couldn't be taught, then they couldn't be taught. Even if you learned it by accident, you couldn't reveal it without permission. That Hu dingfang used the five birds technique in public, and it was the genuine five birds technique ... This didn't conform to the rules!
        Even if his senior apprentice sister had taught him back then, and he had used it to become stronger, it was fine if his teacher did not pursue the matter.
        However ... He couldn't use the five birds technique in front of others!
        This was a huge taboo!
        You've used the exclusive secret technique of the Dao of five birds time and time again, but you're not a member of the five birds sect. If outsiders see this, they'll think that the five birds sect has been destroyed.
        "Alright, then I won't say anything more."
        Hao lianchuan didn't say anything else. After a short chat, he said,""I'll go back first and rest for a while. If you need anything, look for me. If not, you can eat by yourself. I don't really want to eat with you. "
        This fatty was not a big-hearted person. He had just invited them to eat together, but now he was saying that he was not a Martial Master. He was even angry.
        Li Hao didn't say anything. He opened the door and watched as Hao lianchuan entered and slammed the door shut. It seemed like he was quite angry.
        ……
        In the opposite room.
        Hao lianchuan turned around and smiled.
        This guy was interesting.
        He ignored Li Hao and entered the study. After some thought, he took out an old book from the bookshelf.
        [Legend of Silver Moon]
         Opening chapter, Silver Moon martial forest hero list  "As of the day this book was written, there were thirty-six heroes in Silver Moon martial forest!"
        "Speaking of the Wulin, I have to mention one person, Yuan Shuo, the king of five birds. He was skilled in the five birds technique, and he traveled all over the Wulin in seven years. When the five birds challenge letter arrived, the whole place was filled with grief. Those who received it were all scared out of their wits ... Disciples, prepare coffins ..."
        Hao lianchuan read it with great interest. This was an old book that had been written for almost 20 years. It had been a long time since it was updated. It was a pity.
        However, he didn't read much in the past because he wasn't interested in some of the people in the books.
        And now, some of the characters in the books were starting to appear.
        The low-key Yuan Shuo, the impetuous Southern Fist, the Qi Mei staff that suppressed the sky with one staff, the earth-overturning sword, the silver spear that died of illness, the famous Ying Hongyue ... As well as the villains in the book, the three great commanders of the Heavenly Star guards, who were replaced by the three names of Ogre, hahaha monster, and sickbed ghost in the book.
        Who was the Marquis?
        Haha, weird?
        Or a sick ghost?
        The sickbed ghost was more reliable. Could it be that the Marquis had been like this since a long time ago?
        Whether or not hou bu was one of the three great commanders ... Hao lianchuan was pretty sure. But unfortunately, there was not much space in the book about the bedridden ghost. All his appearances were evil. It was obvious that the pugilistic world had a bad impression of the three great commanders!
        After reading the book for a while, another person appeared in his mind.
        Then, he read the book again. The book did not mention such an existence, but chief Yu had been with hou bu for some years, and hou bu had not gone anywhere else. Obviously, they had met here.
        He had stayed in the White moon City for many years, but Chief Steward Yu's appearance was so strange and unusual.
        What kind of inspiration could this book give him?
        In the past, he didn't care.
        Now, she actually didn't care, but she was very curious and wanted to find out more. What was the identity of chief Yu?
        He looked at them one by one and recalled everything about chief Yu ...
        After a long time, he saw a short paragraph at the end of the book ...
        "The bedridden ghost gave up on killing her, and she was one of the few martial masters who managed to escape from the bedridden ghost. The pugilistic world is in chaos, and the superpowers in the central continent have risen. It's time for the martial arts world to withdraw from this era ... Ying Hongyue has left, and the heavenly Sword has left. They've all chosen to leave ..."
        Hao lianchuan looked at it for a while and then carefully flipped through it again.
         She flipped through it for a long time before she suddenly laughed.
        "It can't be?"
        He laughed slyly and incredulously. Soon, he closed the book with a smile.
        "Perhaps ... I know who you are.
        Thinking of the martial masters Gathering tomorrow, he wondered if he would be able to see the legendary figures in the books again. These people were all legends more than twenty years ago, existences that could not be reached.
        And now, after so many years of silence, they seemed to have resurrected one by one.
        Out of Silver moon's 36 heroes, how many were still alive?
        ……
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan was reading a book.
        Li Hao wasn't in the mood to read. At this moment, his muscles were wriggling, and the ninth-refinement force burst out again and again.
       
        The ninth refinement force. Without the ninth refinement, it would be difficult to come into contact with force.
        This was Li Hao's easiest form to master. After completing the ninth refinement, he could almost smoothly comprehend water force. He only needed to form the water sword force.
        "Seven stacks are almost done ..."
        In the past, Li Hao could only complete six layers. This wasn't because the stronger the body, the faster the layers would stack. It was because he needed to Polish his body thousands of times. Li Hao didn't have enough time to do so.
        If he could quickly complete the nine-fold sword force, master the second force, merge it with his sword force, and turn it into the water sword force, Li Hao could begin the second five-viscera accumulation.
        "Five internal organs and five Forces ... What about the four limbs? I control wind, rain, Thunder, and lightning. How should I fuse them?"
        Li Hao thought to himself.
        He pushed his palm out gently. A wave of energy shot out. One, two, three, four, five ...
        In the blink of an eye, the seventh overlay was completed!
        The speed was very fast, but it could be seen that this was the overlapping of seven forces.
         "It's too slow ... And too obvious!"
        Li Hao shook his head slightly. The ninth refinement was still extremely powerful, but unfortunately, it had no other advantages except for its offensive power!
        However, it didn't matter to Li Hao.
        He had managed to create seven stacks, but the ninth might take some time.
        "It's all because Whitemoon city has an ocean ... I saw on the map that there is indeed an ocean to the East of Whitemoon city. Perhaps I should go and see the waves. Are the waves ... Really that strong?"
        He had never seen the ocean before, so he could not feel the changes in the ocean.
        It was said that the seawater was salty, so people living by the sea could eat seafood every day. It was said that women liked to sunbathe on the beach naked ... Perhaps their teacher would like it, but Li Hao didn't care. He just wanted to see the sea.
        Martial arts, diligent in learning!
        No matter how strong he was, if he didn't practice it often, his martial Dao would weaken.
        The small room wasn't suitable for practicing some fist techniques, but Li Hao still flipped up and down for a while. He breathed in and out some inner strength to Polish his five internal organs, and only fell asleep late at night.
        As Li Hao quieted down, next door, Hao lianchuan rubbed his eyes, turned off the lights, and fell asleep.
        Li Hao's first night in white moon City passed quietly.
        ……
        5th of September.
        The sky was clear.
        Early in the morning, the night patrolman's entrance was packed with people.
        Minister Zhou, who was the first to arrive, frowned slightly. He didn't like the noise, but he couldn't do anything to some of these people.
        He stood at the door and said in a deep voice,"you're all seniors, so it's better to follow the rules. It's not time for work yet. Li Hao will naturally appear at nineo' clock sharp. You can just wait at the press conference next door. Why are you all still here?"
        In the crowd, an old man with white hair said anxiously,""It's not that I don't follow the rules, but you night patrollers are working too late! "As a Martial Master, you have to sleep and wake up early. How can you not be here by nineo' clock ..."  These martial masters had arrived very early.
        Some of them didn't even leave and had been waiting outside.
        He had thought that Li Hao would come early in the morning, but it was already eighto' clock and he was still nowhere to be seen. Was he still a Martial Master?
        The system of the night patrolman ... It was the first time everyone knew that it was so relaxed. Some martial masters opened martial arts dojos, and at five or Sixo' clock, the dojos would be bustling with noise.
        Superpowers were really blessed by the heavens. They did not even need to cultivate!
        These old martial masters were envious, jealous, and even disdainful.
        How much combat power could such a superpower have?
        Unfortunately, he could only be envious.
        Superpowers had become the Orthodox. Martial masters nowadays were already in their Twilight. It was useless to rise earlier than chickens. Hearing the chicken dance, even superpowers would be laughed at. Practicing martial arts all year round would not be as fast as others absorbing a little mysterious energy.
        These people were making a ruckus when a car stopped.
        Li Hao came out first, followed by Hao lianchuan.
        Seeing so many people, Li Hao hurriedly said,""Seniors, I'm sorry. I woke up a long time ago and wanted to rush over, but I didn't know the way. In the end, I could only rush over with uncle nie. I've made everyone wait!"
        "Seniors, please take a seat at the press conference venue next door. I'll be right there," he said immediately after a few polite words.
        Seeing that Li Hao had come in person, and hearing his polite words, everyone chose to leave.
        He was just worried before, so Li Hao didn't come.
        Now that he was here, he naturally felt at ease.
        Soon, these martial masters disappeared in the blink of an eye. Some of the martial masters looked like they were only in the tenth realm, but it was unknown how the night patrolmen arranged for them to even let in the tenth realm.
        Hao lianchuan got out of the car, looked at the time, and laughed.
         He was really impatient!
        From the corner of his eye, he seemed to have seen someone and smiled again. It seemed that not only the Martial Master was anxious, but the others were also very anxious!
        "Pack up, we'll go over later!"
        Hao lianchuan said to Li Hao,""Don't worry, it's just next door to the night patrolman. Nothing big will happen, just don't talk nonsense!"
        "Understood!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao nodded and followed him in. Many Nightwatchers were very curious. They knew that today's event would be made public, and they all wanted to know some news in advance.
        Unfortunately, they weren't too familiar with Li Hao.
        However, there were acquaintances.
        The people who explored the ruins with him knew Li Hao.
        At this moment, Huang Yun waited for Hao lianchuan to leave before he came over and asked curiously,""Li Hao, is the blood God's clone really that useful to martial masters?"
       
        Li Hao nodded."Elder Huang," he said."Why would you lie to us?"
        "You'll find out later. Old Huang, do you want to go watch it later?"he said with a smile.
        "I want to go and see ... But ..."
        "Then let's go,"
        Li Hao chuckled."It's not a big secret. It's going to be made public. It's nothing."
        Huang Yun nodded with a smile. That's true, he would like to join in the fun and listen to the gossip.
        As they were chatting, a receptionist in the hall quickly said,""Patrol li, department head Hao wants you to go to Secretary Yu's office on the fourth floor!"
        "Thank you!"
        Li Hao thanked him, but he was a little excited.
        Was Xuguang's Blood God going to be given to him?
         ……
        On the fourth floor.
        There were many people coming and going. They were all secretaries, drivers, and so on. It was quieter. Everyone had things to do to serve the Department heads.
        Chief Steward Yu had a single office here, which was very big, even bigger than Hao lianchuan 's.
        He knocked on the door.
        The other party's cold voice came from inside.
        Li Hao entered.
        He quickly saluted with great respect.
        "Good day, Secretary Yu!"
        Li Hao straightened his back.
        On the other side of the desk, Chief Steward Yu glanced at him and nodded slightly.
        Without saying anything, he took out a box from the drawer and opened it. There were 10 red pills inside.
        "This is the blood God's spawn left behind after you killed red hair. Because you weren't strong enough, the Minister divided the energy into ten portions! Sunglow actually meant nine suns. The early stage of the sun glory realm was one sun, and the peak of the sun glory realm was close to three. The three sun realm has three suns as the starting point and nine suns as the peak. "
        "Even if this Blood God at the Sunglow level is split into 10 portions, the effect of each portion is still much stronger than that of a Blood God at the radiant sun level ..."
        She went straight to the point and was very straightforward.
        "You've only broken through 100 levels. The energy of this Blood God is more than the total of your internal strength. So I suggest you take it after you enter the warrior dimension. Take one at a time. One is enough for you to digest for about a month."
        "One year's time. If you consume all of them, it will be enough to double your inner strength!"
        Li Hao listened carefully and was a little confused.""Secretary Yu, does this mean that the effect of this pill is only slightly stronger than that of the Sun glory pill?"
        That would be such a pity!
        Why did they separate? if that's the case, the sunrise-level pills were only a little stronger than 10 sunbeams ... He was very clear about the medicinal effects of the sunbeams. If it was just that, then his expectations for the sunbeams would be completely gone!
        Li Hao would be very disappointed!
        He didn't ask you to separate. He knew that the effect of not separating would be much stronger.
        Sometimes, it wasn't just the amount of energy, but also the strength and integration.
        Taking 10 of them together would not be as good as sunguang 's. This was a 100% success rate!
        This was because a single sunrise-ranked Pearl was a whole entity.
         The value was completely different!  A 10-pound watermelon would definitely taste better than 10 watermelons that weighed 1 pound, because the watermelons that weighed 1 pound were not ripe yet.
        Chief Steward Yu glanced at him and smiled.""If you feel that separating them will waste the effect ... Then take a few more at a time. Don't worry, these are cut off from the same body. If you're not afraid of death, take all 10 at once. However, I don't suggest you do that. The Minister has his own reasons for separating, and I'm afraid you'll die from overeating!"
        That's good!
        "Thank you, department head!" Li Hao smiled."Thank you, Secretary Yu!"
        "No need to thank me!"
        Chief Steward Yu was very cold and said casually,""Besides, this was exchanged for your sword. The Minister asked me to ask you if you know how to unseal that sword?"
        Even if it wasn't the Li family's sword, it still wouldn't be too simple.
        Therefore, even if his guess wasn't correct, hou Xiaochen didn't care. It was worth it if the sword was a sealed origin god weapon.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao shook his head.
        Chief Steward Yu didn't care. It didn't matter if he didn't know.
        "During the press conference later, remember to emphasize the effects of the blood God ... The rest is up to you!"
        "Yes!"
        Li Hao saluted, his face solemn.
        "Go!"
        "Alright!"
        Li Hao took the box and put it in his pocket, very excited.
        After Li Hao left the office, Chief Steward Yu frowned slightly and looked at the door for a while. After a long while, he shook his head slightly and didn't say anything.
        Li Hao was most likely a thousand-player!
        This could be seen from the Minister's reaction that day.
        This was not important!
        It wasn't like she had never seen a Qian warrior before.
        What she was more curious about was whether Li Hao's Qian battle ... Was the same as Yuan Shuo 's.
        Probably not.
        Also, he didn't condense the aura of the five birds, and it seemed to be just sword aura ... This fellow actually didn't walk the Dao of the five birds, and Yuan Shuo actually didn't care. This was the key.
         There was a ready-made path, but he did not take it. Instead, he chose to use sword force. Back then, none of the Seven Swords could match Yuan Shuo. How strong was the heavenly Sword?
        And the result?
        Could it be that Yuan Shuo felt that his disciple's achievements would be greater if he were to walk the path of the sword than the path of five birds?
        He was a little puzzled.
        However, what did it matter?
        No matter how strong Yuan Shuo was, she didn't think much of it. No matter how strong he was, he might not be able to compare to the Minister. Even when Yuan Shuo dominated an era back then, it was the same. He could do whatever he wanted only because the Minister didn't care about him.
        A faint smile appeared on Chief Steward Yu's face.
        Very quickly, his smile disappeared.
        Recently, Whitemoon city had been in a mess ... But it didn't matter. The Minister had come out, and everything could naturally be solved.
        If he continued to cause trouble, he might have to do something.
