In fact, many venerable sovereigns would like to eat such trash."To tear down the medium level world!"Li Hao laughed."You've advanced again after your previous experience. The effect of dismantling it this time will definitely be different. Dismantle a few more and perfect my small world!" Although it's hard to reach the fifth step now, I'll at least be able to walk a bit further on the path of the fourth step. ""Alright," he said.Lin Hongyu did not say anything more. The two of them treated the broken small world as trash and threw it here. Soon, they went to the middle-level world.Li Hao used time backtrack again.As for the accumulation of the lightning tribulation ... There was nothing to be afraid of.The lightning tribulation didn't have to be thrown at the enemy, nor did it have to be done with underhand ... Li Hao had been considering constructing the destructive world that the chaos lightning tribulation possessed!With the power of destruction as the main force, he could directly capture lightning the next time.In the future, the primal Chaos lightning tribulation might even become his nourishment.It would be a waste to just throw it to the enemy.Of course, Li Hao had yet to start constructing worlds with the power of destruction, which was relatively more troublesome. He had tried it once before, but it could easily cause the world to be destroyed instantly.A world that was based on destruction ... Destruction was the mainstream, so the world would naturally be destroyed.How to stabilize the power of destruction was a big problem.As for how the chaos lightning tribulation was formed and how it was steadily released ... Li Hao could learn from this. If he hadn't been so busy and troublesome recently, he would have summoned a few lightning tribulations. When he had nothing to do, he would have gone to have fun with the chaos lightning tribulation, or even ... Reminisce about the past.The chaos lightning tribulation was targeted at time, and Li Hao had never used time backtrack on lightning tribulations. If he did, he might be in big trouble, but something interesting might also happen.Sometimes, he would even consider a problem. The key problem when I use time travel is the lightning tribulation.However, what if I keep forcing the lightning tribulation to retreat?When the lightning tribulation struck, I turned back time. When the lightning tribulation struck, I turned back time ...In the end, was there a lightning tribulation that could destroy chaos, or was the lightning tribulation completely reversed by him to the point where it disappeared?Of course, such an experiment was too dangerous.There was a 99% chance that he would play himself to death. It was like a chicken giving birth to an egg, and an egg giving birth to a chicken. There was a high probability that he would not be able to hold on and would exhaust his lifespan first.…… p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Dao web of the middle-level worlds had become even more complete.This mid-tier world was no longer dominated by the fire element. Instead, it was a relatively rare Dao technique, which Li Hao defined as extension. It could be big or small, and it could expand or contract at will.It was a rather rare Dao law and a rather useless Dao law. With this Dao law as the main body of the world, its combat power did not seem too strong. In the chaos, it was actually very difficult to survive in this world. But for Li Hao, this rule was actually very interesting.In his opinion, this kind of law was somewhat similar to space ... At the very least, the compression of space was somewhat similar to this Dao law. The expansion and contraction technique could compress the world and use universe creator. If one cultivated it to the extreme, Li Hao could even imagine instantly shrinking the enemy infinitely ... Although it might not necessarily suppress the enemy's strength, it would be of little value.It was an interesting Dao law. Li Hao learned more about it and then began to break the net with Lin Hongyu.This time, it was smoother than before.With the experience from the first time, it was much smoother this time. Not only that, but Li Hao also inserted some great Dao laws into some territories to improve his little realms.For a time, they had a lot of fun.Sometimes, cultivation wasn't always good. It was both fun and educational. In Li Hao's opinion, cultivation was a process of enjoyment and exploration.Any kind of Tao technique, when cultivated to the extreme, would be very interesting.Even if it was some seemingly useless mantras!……For example, at this moment, Li Hao had condensed a Dao law that seemed useless to outsiders.He had even used this Dao law as his main force to condense a small world.Above the river.Li Hao, Lin Hongyu, and the two cats were like children. They squatted on the river and stared at the small realm that was gradually forming. They were all full of curiosity.Second cat was also attracted. At this moment, he was a little curious and confused. "What's the use of you condensing a realm with such a Dao law?"He felt that it was completely useless.Trash Dao law!It had heard and learned a lot, but under normal circumstances ... What was the use of wasting energy to open up such a realm!Lin Hongyu was curious as well, but she did not say anything.She just enjoyed this carefree moment. Although it felt useless ... In this place, Li Hao was like a child, wantonly demolishing and building houses. It was like a child building a castle on the beach. Although childish, it was interesting."You don't understand!"Li Hao laughed. At this moment, he was not condensing a stretched boundary, but another kind of boundary that Li Hao had defined as "attached" to a Dao law.Attachment was a rather special Dao law that Li Hao had discovered.It had appeared in the mid-level worlds before, but it was very weak. However, it had a special characteristic. It could attach itself to other great DAOs, and it could even assimilate some of them or be assimilated by other great DAOs.It was a very strange great Dao law. It was not very powerful and had almost no effect.

Chapter 2911 A Storm Is Coming (3)
When he encountered a strong person, he would not be able to assimilate others at all. He would only be assimilated by others.When he met a weakling ... He would just kill him. Attaching himself to someone else's great Dao wouldn't be of much use.That was why second cat felt that Li Hao was wasting his time and energy.Second cat was confused,"I don't understand?" Then tell me, what's the point of you building such a realm?"It was meaningless!Li Hao laughed,"of course it's meaningful!" Attachment could also be called assimilation, or passive assimilation! It's not about assimilating others, it's a special Dao of being assimilated by others...If, and I'm saying if, in the future, when my embryonic form of the myriad worlds really develops into the myriad worlds and into a small chaos, the matter and living beings born in this world ... Can assimilate others, or be assimilated by others!"“……”It was still meaningless!Second cat was confused.Li Hao was mentally exhausted."Senior, in other words, this is a resource-based realm. Everything born in this realm can be absorbed, absorbed, and digested by others ... Moreover, it doesn't care about the attributes of the great Dao, race, or cultivation method. This is a resource-based realm that can satisfy all cultivators!""For example, if a living being can be born in this world, then the flesh and blood of this living being are actually treasures ... They can be refined directly by cultivators, and they are most suitable for one's body, because they can attach themselves to one's great Dao."Second cat was stunned. The next moment, it seemed to take a deep breath."Then don't let it really become a realm. Otherwise, according to what you said, wouldn't this realm become meat in everyone's eyes?"How was this attachment? this path should be called the path of fat.Everyone who saw it should want to take a bite!"The birth of the kapok tree will soon be destroyed by others, exterminating them ..."Li Hao smiled and said, there's a reason for the existence of all DAOs! "If an expert can really be born from attaching a Dao to it, it's actually an extremely powerful Dao law. As I said, this is called assimilation, or being assimilated. It's actually the same. In the eyes of others, this is a highly sought after item. On the side of attaching a Dao, if an expert can really be born ... Then the other person is a highly sought after item ... In fact, they're equal! "If you cultivate this path well, although everyone covets it, you can also covet others. Others can only covet your side, while you can covet everyone else ...",m Second cat nodded his head and thought it made sense.For a moment, he was somewhat interested. He looked at this small world ... Although it was called a world, it was actually only the size of a human head. It was a very small world, and Li Hao was only interested in it. It had just been created."This is interesting!"Second cat's whiskers curled up."All of the ten thousand DAOs do have their own unique aspects! If it can really give birth to living beings ... Then this world will either become the target of other worlds or ... Become an Overlord!"Li Hao smiled and nodded,"that's it!" However ... I'm just talking about it now. I might not be able to give life to the world in my life. It's too difficult. Let alone Level 7, I don't think even level 8 or level 9 can do it. ""That's hard to say,""You're different ... You know how to use time!"Li Hao was stunned for a moment before he nodded.Perhaps! He didn't say anything else. Everything that happened today was just a small pleasure in cultivation. This "attached" realm seemed very powerful ... But in reality, it wasn't much.Li Hao had tried to use this boundary opening because he thought that this Dao law with the ability to assimilate might be able to change the attributes of some great DAOs.For example, the power of the red moon didn't match with the power of the red moon sovereign ... Except for Qian Wuliang.If he could attach a great Dao and successfully attach the power of the Crimson Moon to it, he would be able to reverse it into a great Dao of another attribute ... It would be very useful and amazing!For example, it attached itself to the Crimson Moon great Dao and reversed into an attached force.Then, it would attach itself to other people's great DAOs ... This way, it could be changed into the power of great DAOs suitable for other people. This way, the compatibility would be extremely high, and resources would not be wasted.This Dao was a complete auxiliary great Dao, a perfect auxiliary great Dao.Of course, if there was really a heaven-defying person who cultivated this Dao to the extreme and assimilated all the great DAOs, it would be unbelievable. It would be an omnipotent Dao.However ... Li Hao shook his head as he looked at the boundary that was the size of a human head.Forget it!With this, you want to give birth to a heaven-defying creature?What a joke.In the future, if a living creature was born, it would most likely become the target of other experts. They would kill the living creature in this world, take its blood and body, and fuse it with their body ... That would be perfect.As this thought flashed through his mind, Li Hao looked around. Realms appeared one after another, much larger than before, and several of them were more stable than before.He revealed a smile!He was very satisfied!This time, his strength had not improved much, and he had used up a large number of resources. He had destroyed two worlds, and he had spent hundreds of millions of great Dao crystals ...Anyone else, even a fourth stage venerable sovereign, would have improved a lot.Li Hao didn't improve at all! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, he was very satisfied and happy.He felt that it was much more cost-effective and profitable than the Dao crystals he had absorbed before.At this moment, Li Hao looked at second cat.""Senior second cat, the purification you mentioned before ..."Second cat wagged its short tail and said,"I know you can't wait!"

2912 Chapter 479
At this time, it was also a little emotional. It looked at the long river and then at the boundaries."I suggest that in the future, you comprehend some of the Dao of purification by yourself. With the power of purification as your main force, you can purify the power of the river! This way, your Dao energy will be purer, and you will discover ... A different world!"Was it?He had not experienced it yet!Ermao didn't say anything more. The next moment, it opened its mouth wide and a powerful devouring force appeared. It let Li Hao sense the power of purification while it used the power of devouring.The essence of the two was different, but the effect was similar.What it devoured were those impurities.In just an instant, the long river fluctuated!Li Hao looked at the river. In an instant, he saw countless spots of light appearing madly and being swallowed by the second cat.The power of the great DAOs in the original River was still very pure.Li Hao would purify it every time!Compared to ordinary fourth-stage venerable sovereigns, Li Hao would break the head of anyone who dared to say that his power of great DAOs was not pure.But at this moment ... Li Hao suddenly felt lost.Countless light spots were being devoured crazily!Wisps of the great Dao's power disappeared into the long river. The flowing river instantly stopped. In the blink of an eye, a third of the water of the great Dao in the river seemed to have disappeared!Second cat was still devouring!Li Hao opened his mouth ... If I keep swallowing like this, I won't only have half of the energy left in my River of Dao, right?Then I ... Won't lose a level, right?"This ..."Li Hao wanted to say something, but in the end, he didn 't. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He couldn't judge the two cats by their own standards. The two cats definitely didn't say that to devour the energy ...Li Hao muttered in his heart.At that moment, it seemed like second cat had finished devouring all the light spots. He opened his mouth and swallowed all of them.The great Dao water that was floating in the air ... Fell with a loud rumble.The river continued to flow.At this moment, Li Hao's aura seemed to have weakened.However ... The next moment, Li Hao's heart trembled!Easy!There was only one feeling, and it was extremely relaxed. Previously, the long river of the great path seemed to have become a burden on his back. But at this moment, it was as if the entire burden had disappeared.The entire world, the entire River ... The Dao laws suddenly became extremely clear.The previously chaotic laws of great Dao suddenly became particularly clear in Li Hao's eyes. He felt as if he had been cleansed.It was as if he hadn't taken a bath for decades, and now that he had taken a bath, all the dirt on his body had been washed away.Comfortable!To his heart's content! The water in the river of Dao became much clearer, and Dao laws could be clearly seen in the river. Li Hao was stunned when he saw them!This ... Was purification?He was stunned. Lin Hongyu took a look and was a little dazed as well. She saw her life and death Star ... It was smaller than before. She was still a rank two, but she could feel that the power in her body had weakened a lot.But before, her stars had always been a little blocked in Li Hao's path.p At this moment, the star was like a happy little fish, instantly falling into the river and flowing happily in the river.She also felt that the world in her eyes seemed to have changed.The entire River ... If it had been misty before, it was now fresh and refined.Second cat took a deep breath and looked a little tired.It was obvious that this devouring was a burden to it. It was not easy."When we get out of the forest world, I'll find a place in the chaos ... I'm going to fart and release some of the waste that has accumulated in my body ..."“……”At first, Li Hao and Lin Hongyu were still immersed in this ethereal feeling, but they were suddenly jolted awake.Li Hao was stunned and didn't know whether to laugh or cry.You're talking about this at this time?Aren't you a killjoy?Vulgar or not!You're a venerable sovereign, yet you still want to fart ... Seriously ... That's right, there are too many impurities, maybe they should be discharged. However, he couldn't help but say,""Emperor Cang doesn't need it, right?""Big cat eats everything, I'm not eating!"Second cat was too lazy to say anything, but big cat obviously didn't need it. Big cat was even more of a dog than a Black Panther!A Black Panther was a picky eater, but a big cat ... Would eat anything!The filthier something was, the more delicious it would taste to big cat. It was disgusting ... Second cat thought to himself. Of course, at this moment, he felt a little helpless. Big cat was the source of filthiness.To the big cat, if it didn't eat anything dirty, it didn't have much meaning in existence.Li Hao didn't say anything. He just silently sensed for a moment. The relaxation of his body and mind made him feel as if he had merged with the river. It was as if he had always been separated from the river.It wasn't because of the firmament sword or anything else. He just felt that there was a barrier between him and the river.But now, it seemed like it was gone.That feeling ... Made Li Hao somewhat addicted to it.After a long time, Li Hao opened his eyes and looked at second cat."Many thanks, senior!"This time, second cat had done him a big favor!His comprehension of the Dao laws in the river became even clearer.Second cat didn't say anything and quickly said, "I'm going to sleep ... I'll rest for a while, don't wake me up!""Alright!"Without saying a word, he dove into the river and disappeared from sight.

2913 Chapter 479
"You've entered Rank 2, so it's time for you to leave!"Li Hao looked at Lin Hongyu.As for one more person, it was nothing.Everyone knew that there was a venerable sovereign, and it was normal for venerable sovereigns to hide in places to cultivate.If they went out now, everyone would only think that Lin Hongyu had been hiding in some treasure or cultivating in a small world.Lin Hongyu nodded.……Soon, the two of them appeared near the crack.At this moment, Li Hao's original body appeared. He suddenly discovered that the entire world had become much clearer. He looked up, but he didn't see the Dao net, because he hadn't integrated into the world. This was the privilege of a world Lord.However, Li Hao still clearly sensed something.There were still benefits to tearing down the world.At this moment, he sensed that ... In the depths and ends of the world, there seemed to be a huge net that covered the entire world. This net ... Might be the barrier called the bed universe!Li Hao's heart stirred slightly. If that was the case, then the Dao universe was the ultimate form of the Dao net. If he could detect the Dao net, did it mean that ... He could discover the location of the Dao universe at any time?If I can find the pattern, won't I be able to sneak into the Dao universe at any time?Back in Silver Moon, he didn't dare to reveal the location of the great Dao universe.Once they were locked on, it was easy for powerhouses to force their way in.Back then, li daoheng and Zheng Yu had both been thinking of ways to forcefully lock onto the position of the Dao universe in order to forcefully invade the Dao universe ... In that case, the position of the Dao universe in their eyes ... Was actually the world behind the Dao net?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.At that moment, the others were stunned. Lin Hongyu had reached level two?So fast! no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  Qian Wuliang's eyes also flickered. Although they had all reached level three, it was not unusual for them to reach level three as Masters of Dao and Li Hao had spent countless resources on them. Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, was only rooted in Li Hao's River of Dao and not a master of Dao or a world Lord, but she had also reached level two so quickly.With such a comparison ... All the old seniors like King Huai would have to die.At this moment, King Huai was also envious.This was a sleeping victory!Sure enough, when one person achieved Dao, his chickens and dogs would rise to heaven.Back then, the human King's lover and sister had followed the human King to become the master of the world and the master of the great Dao. Over the years, these two had caught up and stepped into the middle-stage venerable sovereign realm.Not everyone in neo martial arts was a middle-stage venerable sovereign. Some of the older seniors were only beginner venerable sovereigns. Of course, this also proved how powerful Li Hao was.It was unbelievable that a 4th tier power could push so many people to quickly step into the 2nd or 3rd tier.Logically speaking, he should not have surpassed the master of the great Dao.……As soon as Li Hao came out, he received a message from the jade pendant Yan Fang gave him."A venerable sovereign is about to arrive in the Crimson Moon world! The leader of the three venerable sovereigns was a rank six venerable sovereign, devour soul! The other two were both at the fifth rank! They are soul shocking and life saving!""A rank six venerable sovereign from a great world ... Is definitely very powerful! "This time, there's a chance for this soul devouring sovereign to enter the seventh level. Hong Yue has lost three seventh level sovereign, but with the current situation, Hong Yue's great Dao can still produce another seventh level sovereign. Hong Yue has many sixth level sovereign, and there are nine of them on the surface. In fact, there might be more hidden, cultivating in seclusion, hoping to enter the seventh level!""Now, these sixth level venerable sovereigns are all looking for opportunities to make contributions. They hope to be favored by the red moon master and rise to the top in one step!"The difference between Tier 6 and tier 7 was extremely huge.Advancing from the sixth step to the seventh step was absolutely reaching the heavens in a single step.Yan Fang's message also told Li Hao that in order to make a contribution and become a rank seven venerable sovereign, the other party would definitely not show mercy. At the critical moment, they might even attack the venerable sovereigns of the Senlan realm.Li Hao frowned slightly.One at the sixth step and two at the fifth step.He was definitely not weak.But ..."Senior Yan Fang," Li Hao replied."If a sixth-level Crimson Moon directly enters the arena ... Is it possible for a seventh-level Crimson Moon to descend, or for a master of the eighth level to descend directly to Senlan?""Not at the moment!" Yan Fang quickly replied,"at the moment, neo martial's whereabouts are uncertain. Previously, when venerable sovereign Xing Shen was killed, the other party might still be hiding in the nearby area. Therefore, the two high-level venerable sovereigns will not leave the Crimson Moon so easily!""Even if they leave, they will return quickly. Therefore, unless the Crimson Moon can guarantee that they can take down Senlan in one fell swoop and seize the great Dao universe, they will definitely not appear in the Senlan realm so easily! Otherwise, once Senlan retaliates and delays the other party for a while, even if it's only for a moment, Red Moon will be in big trouble once neo martial launches a surprise attack!""Secondly, the other party has to consider the attitudes of the other major worlds. The Crimson Moon needs allies now ... The master of the Crimson Moon hopes that we will feel the pressure and have no choice but to surrender, instead of suppressing us by force. Otherwise, it will easily cause the other three major worlds to be wary of us."In other words, unless he had no other choice, he would not leave in a short period of time.Or, it was certain that neo martial was not here.After his spirit was killed, the Supreme martial artist set up a maze and used his clone and two cats to pretend to be the Supreme martial artist and big cat. This made the other party afraid and made the red moon Lord think that new martial was within the range of the red moon.Otherwise, he would not be able to break through the Dao universe and enter.It had to be said that this Supreme of neo martial ... His strength was still unclear, but his means were really not weak. It was only a deception that made this level eight master not dare to make a move easily.

2914 Chapter 479
Unless the red moon could give birth to one or two more rank Sevens, he would not dare to leave easily."I understand! How long will it take for the enemy to reach Senlan?""Very soon, half a day at most!"Then it really wasn't far away.At this time, not only did Senlan have the information, but the experts of the nearby macro worlds also seemed to have received the news. In the distance, the crack that the three macro worlds had joined forces to suppress and the six venerable sovereigns seemed to be waiting for something.The red moon had sent someone again!This time, three middle-stage venerable sovereigns and a sixth-stage Soul Eater were leading the team.With a sixth-tier existence, unless Sen Lan's side made a move, Wan Dao and the others would be finished.Once Sen LAN and Yan Fang acted, they might attract the other powers to act together and force the Sen LAN realm Lord to appear. At that time, the great Dao universe would appear and red Moon master might personally descend!All of a sudden, many people became nervous.……At another location.There were many venerable sovereigns in the rift that was guarded by itinerant cultivators.The middle-rank unaffiliated cultivators all looked at the level six unaffiliated cultivator near the crack, waiting for some response.The young-looking Daoist glanced at the crowd and said softly,""We came here ... To seize the great Dao universe. The chances are slim. Actually, I hope that the Senlan sector Lord has more backbone. If the Crimson Moon really descends, he can directly destroy the Senlan great Dao universe. At that time, we can get some light."“……”Everyone was speechless.Was this ... Possible?If the forest orchid sector Lord had such a backbone, he wouldn't have allowed so many experts to enter so easily. He would have long prepared for a life and death struggle."Senior Yu Xiu, someone from the red moon came. Do we want a share?"A wandering cultivator said as he looked into the distance. His expression was stern and greedy."There are more than ten venerable sovereigns over there!""Moreover, it's said that they can get some bounty from Senlan for killing a venerable sovereign. They must have countless great Dao crystals!""Also, there's that ... Extremely powerful monarch weapon!"Yu Xiu was the honorific title of that rank six venerable sovereign.At this moment, the venerable sovereign said softly,""It's not that you can 't, but ... The prerequisite is that the level 7 behind the other party can be forced to come out, or ... That Level 7 has already died or is unable to come. Otherwise, are you sure you want to give it a try?"His words were like a bucket of cold water that was poured on everyone's hearts, extinguishing their greed.That's right!At the moment, it was impossible to determine who the rank-7 behind the other party was, whether he had come, or whether he was nearby.Unless Hong Yue's side could force them to show their trump card. If there was no seventh-rank, it was worth a try!After all, there were more than ten venerable sovereigns!For a moment, these freelance martial artists were also eager to try.Someone chuckled and said in a low voice,"if the venerable sovereigns of Hongyue make a move, we won't have a corresponding countermeasure. Senior, there are more than a dozen venerable sovereigns ... We can share them and get some meat. The venerable sovereigns of the macro worlds probably don't care about these people. But we don't care about wandering in the chaos!""I've heard a rumor, but I don't know if it's true! Venerable sovereign myriad DAOs killed two fourth level Crimson Moon experts and Senlan gave him a medium-level world!""Really?""I'm not sure, but there's a high probability that it's true. ""Hiss ..."Some people took a deep breath, and greed appeared in their eyes.For some venerable sovereigns, medium-level worlds were beyond their reach.A rank three venerable sovereign had a great chance of reaching rank four after devouring an intermediate world. However, a rank three venerable sovereign did not have the ability to attack an intermediate world. Under normal circumstances, an intermediate world Lord was at rank four. A small number of rank three intermediate world Lords were not weaker than rank four world Lords in their own world. Now ... He might have a chance!The grade 6 Yu Xiu looked at everyone and didn't say anything.Who didn't have a little greed in their heart?If not, everyone would not have appeared in Senlan.But ...He looked a little serious. This time, it might not be an opportunity, but a crisis. Once a high-level venerable sovereign appeared and a high-level battle started ... Even if he was a level six, he was in danger of dying.What was the background of the myriad Dao Emperor?Could he lure out the expert behind the scenes? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  What was the forest orchid sector Lord thinking?He had been supporting Emperor myriad DAOs and the others, allowing them to kill Red Moon Emperor ... Was he really not afraid that Red Moon Lord would be angry and attack him directly?New martial ...Whether or not neo martial was nearby was still an unknown.At least, the human King was not here.Without a human King, would neo martial really dare to attack the red moon?Yu Xiu couldn't be sure. In addition, he couldn't be sure how many sixth level venerable sovereigns were hiding at this moment. Like him, they had all come for the great path universe.He had only appeared first. He was sure that Senlan still had many Level-6 world Lords, including some mid-level world Lords.These people were all waiting for an opportunity.……In the universe of the great path.The forest orchid sector Lord was madly refining the entire great Dao universe.At this moment, a cold look appeared in the corner of his eyes.Did the red moon send someone again?He looked at his surroundings. He was about to completely refine the great Dao universe ... He frowned slightly. There was still a little bit left. The death of the Dao master had caused the large amount of great Dao power accumulated in the great Dao universe to collapse!The human King's Blade was not a good one."There's still a long way to go ... A few more Tier 6 experts might be enough! Wandao ... No matter who you are, if you can kill the Soul Eater ... Perhaps the Crimson Moon will send more rank six experts ..."Even if Hong Yue didn't come, the other rank-6 might not be able to sit still!Did a Tier 4 myriad DAOs have such an ability?It would be very difficult!But what if ... Sen LAN helped him?Many thoughts kept appearing in his mind, and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. As long as he successfully reached Level Seven this time, he could attack or retreat. Now, the only thing, which was also the most critical point ... He hoped that the neo martial could intimidate Red Moon master for a longer time!He could only pray that the neo martial world would not appear in other areas at this time. Otherwise, once his whereabouts were exposed and he was sure that it was not near the Crimson Moon world ... He would be in big trouble!p Neo martial had always been hidden, which was the biggest restriction to Red Moon.It was suspicious that they had been looking for an opportunity to deal with Red Moon.Otherwise, with neo martial's nature, how could they not have any traces or news exposed for so many days?The fact that neo martial was secretly dealing with the sun great world made everyone feel that they were hiding. This also became Senlan's life-saving straw.Everyone was waiting for Hong Yue and the other venerable sovereigns to arrive.As for Li Hao's group ... They abandoned the crack and quickly disappeared.

Chapter 2915 Unanimous Opinion (1)
A group of people walked through the forest world.Without a sound.No one made a sound.Li Hao left the crack. At this moment, he was deep in thought.He had come to Senlan with only one purpose, which was to strengthen himself.Qian Wuliang and the others had improved a lot, but for Li Hao ... His progress was too slow. The key was that he needed too many things, which couldn't be completed by some simple Dao crystals.In order to reach level five, Li Hao needed to perfect a large number of little worlds, which would require a large number of great Dao crystals, worlds, and even daosource.In addition, the sword Saint also needed a lot of resources.There were too many!How many?There were so many that a mere sixth-order great world was not enough for them to fulfill their needs.So, if his goal had been to take down Sen LAN before, now ... It really wasn 't.Instead, he hoped to take a risk and enter the Crimson Moon through this platform.It was very dangerous!However, if he succeeded, the rewards would definitely be unparalleled.Behind them ... There seemed to be some consciousness following them. They didn't know if it was Supreme Emperor Sen Lan's or the hidden Supreme Emperor 's. Someone was watching them."Where to?"Hong Yitang asked.If they were to leave like this ... No matter how far they went, it was only a big world, and a sixth-grade one at that. The place was not too big. If a sixth-grade venerable sovereign really came, would they be able to hide?"Let's find a place to bury the Tier 6!"Li Hao spoke calmly, but the others were speechless.You speak as if you can really kill a sixth step.Unless ... Li Hao could borrow strength again?But recently, he didn't have any corpses or Taoist connotation to borrow strength from.Li Hao ignored them and continued to walk.Measuring the earth!Some of the experts who were watching in the dark were a little confused. What was this guy going to do by walking around?"The Crimson Moon expert is here. You can either run away or seek Senlan's protection.What's the use of wandering around now?Li Hao did not care about the people hiding in the dark. It was difficult to hide their tracks. Moreover, there must be Red Moon Emperor still lurking in the forest world. It was almost impossible to hide from his opponent. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  The reason he was walking around was to measure the range, position, and extent of the Dao net's spread.To determine if this mysterious sector Lord Senlan could reach the 7th step or not.There can't be a plan that can't be made. If there is, then there must be a plan ...Sector Lord Sen LAN had always been unwilling to compromise when facing the Crimson Moon. He wasn't willing to join easily. Regardless of whether he joined the Crimson Moon or not, he still wanted to maximize the benefits before joining.He would not become a complete vassal of the Crimson Moon, but at least he would have a certain right to speak.If that was the case ... Some things could be decided based on the situation.After measuring for a while and seeing something, Li Hao suddenly said,""Realmlord, my people, there are people who wish to join Sen LAN. I wonder if realmlord is free now?"Before this, this was what sector Lord Sen LAN had agreed to.Now, Li Hao wanted the other party to fulfill his promise.Join Senlan!The air rippled slightly, and the voice of sector Lord Sen LAN resounded in their ears.""Don't resist!"Everyone felt a teleportation force. They all looked at Li Hao, who nodded.​ A moment later, the group of people instantly disappeared.Some of the wills that were following them in the dark all disappeared. At this moment, many people had their hearts stirred ... Did sector Lord Sen LAN make a move?To protect the myriad DAOs sect?……On a high mountain, Li Hao's eyes flickered.The location he had chosen earlier was not a random one.In the end, he was moved away.This was rather interesting.He didn't say anything. Very swiftly, a faint illusory figure appeared in front of him. The Senlan realmlord's true body had never appeared before, it was like he was defending against something.At this moment, the illusionary figure appeared with an apologetic look. "I'm still guarding the Dao universe. The Dao universe is fluctuating violently. My young friend myriad DAOs, please forgive me.""Realmlord is too polite!""That's what I should do!"Li Hao nodded."I have three fellow Daoists here who are willing to join the forest orchid world!"King Huai, Yi, and Chan Xiu all took a step forward.Sector Lord Sen LAN swept a side...There wasn't even a single stage three, two peak stage two, one peak stage one...Even though they were all venerable sovereigns, their strength...Could only be considered average.Many thoughts appeared in sector Lord Sen Lan's mind.The three weakest venerable sovereigns?Not really. Beside Wan Dao, there was a venerable sovereign who seemed to have just stepped into the second stage.A thought appeared in his mind, and he quickly smiled and said,"sure!" "Senlan, you're welcome to join us at any time ... However, Senlan is only a Tier 6 great world now, and it can only accommodate three to five people at the moment ... If no one else can join us this time, you're welcome to join us at any time when I, Senlan, have reached tier 7!""Thank you, realm Lord!"King Huai and the other two were somewhat apprehensive as they spoke.King Huai was fine, but Chan Xiu and Yan ... Were really nervous.Joining Senlan ... Was really an extremely risky move!At this moment, Li Hao looked at King Huai and the others.""The few of you, fuse with the Dao and enter the forest orchid cosmos! In the future, Senlan and I will be on the same side. When Senlan reaches the seventh step ... She will be able to accommodate all of us. At that time, we will be able to continue working together!"The three venerable sovereigns didn't know what to say.Even King Huai felt a little melancholic for a moment ... The great Dao universe had changed again. It really made one feel melancholic.Sector Lord Sen LAN smiled,"naturally!" "Then I'll open the entrance to the great Dao universe ... It's very difficult to integrate the great Dao universe, but it's also very simple ... There's one more thing. I need to judge your Dao laws ... If I, Senlan, am a cultivator of the same path and become a venerable sovereign, it's not impossible to integrate it. However, there may be some trouble. For example, the power of the great Dao is limited to those of the same attribute, so there may be a competition between the two."

Chapter 2916 Unanimous Opinion (2)
"Therefore, try not to use the same attribute ... Of course, if they really overlap, it doesn't matter. It still depends on the individual's ability!"Sector Lord Sen LAN was also very clear. Once cultivators with the same attribute of the great Dao entered the same great Dao universe, there would be a fight for the great Dao of energy between the two sides."I know that," Li Hao nodded.Li Hao then added,"I don't know if the three of them overlap. I don't know much about Supreme Emperor Sen LAN. If they do overlap, it's not a big deal. We're the latecomers. How can we compete with our seniors?"Speaking of this, Li Hao added, there's another thing that I have to tell the sector Lord in advance."What's the matter?"sector Lord Sen Lan's laughter rang out.Li Hao hesitated before saying,"in order to avoid a misunderstanding, I'll make it clear in advance. These three fellow Daoists ... Previously joined a Dao universe, but later they left. However, they more or less have the aura of a Dao universe. I'm worried that there will be a conflict."“……”Silence!Absolute silence!At this moment, the projection of the Sen LAN sector Lord seemed to tremble slightly.He had joined a great Dao universe and then ... Quit!Not to mention how difficult it was to join, could a venerable sovereign quit just because he wanted to?You've taken away the power of the venerable sovereign of the Dao universe, and you're allowed to withdraw at will?You think you can leave just because you want to?What did that mean?King Huai and the others were also extremely nervous.Li Hao ... Was going crazy again.Li Hao looked helpless, but he said seriously,""Originally, we didn't want to mention it ... But since we've joined, I think we should treat people with sincerity! It's not just them. Actually ... We ... We were all considered to have come out of a Dao universe together. It's just that we all withdrew later on!""For various reasons, we can only roam the primordial chaos as itinerant cultivators. This is one of the reasons why we are so rarely known in the primordial chaos! Now that the realmlord is treating people with sincerity, I can't lie to him!"Li Hao sighed,"if the sector Lord finds it difficult ... Then forget it!."Sector Lord Sen LAN was silent for a moment.With a probing tone, he said softly,""Is this ... The realm that little friend's legacy Dao domain's fire element Supreme Emperor opened?""It's not easy to deceive them," Li Hao said, somewhat embarrassed."It's also not easy to go into detail ... In short, we're now sincerely joining Senlan!"What did that mean?Wasn't it? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Countless thoughts flashed through Senlan's mind. In the end, he decided that it was either from the realm of the rank seven venerable sovereign or ... From new martial world! However, the venerable sovereigns of new martial arts were quite famous. He had never heard of so many unknown people.One or two of them could hide their identities ... But there were more than ten venerable sovereigns. As a neo martial venerable sovereign, did none of them really travel through the chaos?For a moment, he could not make a judgment.It would be fine if there were only one or two, but all of them were cultivators from the universe of the great path ... He wanted to say "F * ck". Which world would give up on so many venerable sovereigns?Even for a level-eight great cosmos, losing more than ten venerable sovereigns in an instant would be a huge loss.What was even more troublesome was that since they had walked out of the universe of DAOs, he might not have noticed anything even if Li Hao had not said anything. At most, he would have noticed that these people's power of DAOs was purer and not as chaotic as that of the itinerant cultivators.He must have guessed it ... But what was this myriad DAOs sect cultivator thinking?Isn't it enough for everyone to know?He kept thinking about something.Li Hao continued,"if the sector Lord is making things difficult for you, then so be it. We won't make things difficult for you!.""Little friend, you worry too much!"The forest orchid sector Lord considered for a moment. Very quickly, he came to a decision. Since he had withdrawn ... Who could prove that he knew that they came from another great world?At this moment, he was still hoping that the myriad DAOs sect would be able to surprise him.There were many venerable sovereigns Senlan, but there were none who dared to kill venerable Red Moon. Even if there were, they might not be able to kill him.Second, if he killed them, Senlan might run into some trouble.Sector Lord Sen LAN quickly understood. He smiled,"Since it's already in the past, why bring up the past?"Li Hao immediately shed tears of gratitude and said excitedly,""Thank you for your forgiveness, realm Lord!"When she said this, she was a little embarrassed."That ... I have one more thing to ask realm Lord. I wonder if realm Lord ... Can answer it?""Little friend, just say it."Li Hao was a little hesitant, but he still said,""Our Senlan is currently in a confrontation with Crimson Moon. The only reason we can hold on is that neo martial arts pose a huge threat to Crimson Moon. On one hand, Crimson Moon wants some face, so we don't want to openly snatch it!""If ... If it really comes to a critical moment, the realm Lord will still face the threat of Hong Yue regardless of whether he has advanced to the seventh rank or not. If he can't advance, not only Hong Yue, but the others will also be eyeing him covetously!""If I can advance and enter the seventh rank ..."Li Hao still said,"even if they enter Level Seven, they don't have much of an advantage in the chaotic Red Moon zone. More than one or two level Seven venerable sovereigns have died. I want to know, will the sector Lord side with the red moon in the end?"The forest orchid sector Lord was silent.Was this person from new martial arts, the chiyang region, or some other major force?Are you asking me about my future plans?A stage four venerable sovereign asking a peak stage six venerable sovereign what his future plans were ... The Senlan sector Lord could have just ignored it.

Chapter 2917 Unanimous Opinion (3)
But at this moment, Li Hao's identity was unknown.There might be a powerful force behind them. Whether it was neo martial or chiyang, they were not people Senlan could provoke.Sector Lord Sen LAN pondered for a moment before saying,"After all, our Senlan is in the Hongyue region! This place was called the red moon region! An eighth rank venerable sovereign is not far away and could arrive at any time. If I can't advance ... Senlan will eventually be close to Hong Yue!""If I can advance to the seventh step ..."He was a little helpless and sighed."Unless a new martial artist appears to resist the Crimson Moon, otherwise ... Even if I reach Level Seven, I'll only be at the beginning. In addition, I'm too close to the Crimson Moon and I killed the Crimson Moon sovereign. At that time, in order to protect Senlan's interests, I can only join the Crimson Moon!"Li Hao nodded."That is to say, no matter what we achieve in Senlan ... In the end, we will still side with the Crimson Moon?"The forest orchid sector Lord was silent.Yes!This was inevitable.He couldn't even escape, because Hong Yue wouldn't let Sen LAN leave.Finally, going to the Crimson Moon was Senlan's only way out.The deterrent force of a level eight venerable sovereign was too strong.What he was fighting for now was only the future benefits, the benefits within the Crimson Moon.As for killing venerable sovereign Hong Yue now, it didn't matter who he killed. He had become a rank seven venerable sovereign and his status was different. It was impossible for Hong Yue to find trouble with a rank seven venerable sovereign who had brought a group of venerable sovereigns to seek refuge with a master of a major cosmos for a few weak venerable sovereigns."Senlan, is there no way to maintain the independence of the great world?"Li Hao sighed.Sector Lord Sen LAN replied softly,"difficult!" If it's the red moon Lord, there's still hope if he doesn't care about Senlan. However, if he interferes, Senlan ... Can't escape!""Will the three surrounding major worlds interfere?""I won 't," Sector Lord Sen LAN said with some disdain,"on one hand, they are afraid of Red Moon. On the other hand, they are afraid of the new martial. The new martial are crazy, especially the Dark Moon Lord. He is afraid that the human King will really kill him next time. Last time, the human King killed the Dark Lord. Whether it was true or not, the Dark Moon Lord doesn't dare to join the new martial!""In this way, the new martial artists are extremely powerful, and the red moon's side has suffered a great loss. At a critical moment, Red Moon will take us in and restore their strength. They're actually happy to see that happen ... At least, when Red Moon becomes stronger, the Alliance will be more stable! "In fact, they don't want to weaken the red moon's strength at the moment. Otherwise, who will resist the threat of neo martial?"This was true!Li Hao nodded. This person understood. Therefore, the three major worlds had sent people here to see if there were any leftovers. If there weren 't, Sen LAN had to join the Crimson Moon and help it recover!Li Hao finally understood. If the red moon was not strong, who would fight against the neo martial artists?Three seventh level venerable sovereigns of Red Moon had died. If it were any other time, without the threat of neo martial arts, these major world Lords would be able to laugh like a flower. If they weakened the Overlord, they would have a chance to become the Overlord. But now ... If Red Moon was weakened to the extreme and was destroyed by neo martial arts, their families would be dead.Li Hao sighed."Today, we've killed a large number of Red Moon sovereigns. Our status is not as high as the sector Lord 's. The next day, if Red Moon Lord really can take down Senlan, won't we have no way out?"The Senlan realm Lord replied softly,"that's not necessarily the case. When two armies fight, it's normal for both sides to suffer losses. It's the same for the inner realm, outer realm, and even the primal Chaos. The winner will surrender and there's no such thing as settling scores. They wouldn't punish the venerable sovereigns just because of those who died in battle. That would be too much of a blow to the morale of the forces they're subduing. It's easy to create estrangement! The red moon world has annexed many worlds, and many of them have submitted to the venerable sovereign. They have also killed the red moon venerable sovereign, but they have all lived well ..." Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  This was not just the case in the Crimson Moon world, many other worlds were the same."They won't kill you just because a venerable sovereign died during a war, they won, you surrendered, and you were willing to join ... Of course, if they came for destruction at the beginning, it would be different.Those who came for recruitment were different."But did I kill as many of them as I did?""Sector Lord, I seem to have killed a lot!" Li Hao said softly.The forest orchid sector Lord was speechless.That's true.In just a few days, Li Hao had killed a group of venerable sovereigns, including two middle-stage venerable sovereigns. Moreover, it was hard to say if he would kill more in the future. In that case, he, a rank four, might not be able to compete with these red Moon venerable sovereigns.He was still thinking ..."It doesn't matter," Li Hao said."Things will work out when they come to it!"Li Hao smiled."Actually, I don't have any other thoughts. I just have one thought. If I can't keep it, it's fine!" Sector Lord, my brothers and friends are only here to help me...Hong Yue won't do anything to them, right?"For a moment, sector Lord Sen LAN couldn't figure out Li Hao's goal.He was in no hurry to respond."There's one more thing ..." Li Hao continued."May I ask?""Little friend, please speak.""If Senlan melded with the Crimson Moon ... Would she be able to escape?"The forest orchid sector Lord frowned slightly but didn't reply.What did that mean?Li Hao's words were even more direct and explicit."What I mean is, if the Crimson Moon master leaves the Crimson Moon world during the process of taking over, can the sector Lord bring Sen LAN away and quickly leave this area, wandering in the chaos as an independent great world?"

2918 Chapter 480
Sector Lord Sen Lan's image trembled.At this moment, even his original body in the universe of the great path changed his expression slightly.This person ... Just who was he!What did he mean?The red moon master left this place ... In the process of taking over. How could that be?At this moment, unless the red moon could produce a few rank-7s to guard the place, he would not leave easily. In addition, the whereabouts of the new martial artists were also needed. Otherwise, how could the red moon Lord leave so easily?Of course, what if he really left in the process?He thought for a while and said slowly,'the integration of the great worlds will take some time! This period of time could be as short as a few months, as long as a few years or even decades ... At the beginning, it would only be the initial stage of the fusion. At that time, with a rank 8 master present, the speed of the fusion could be accelerated! However, if the other party suddenly leaves ... During this period of time, they can naturally leave after paying a certain price!""If we really have the chance to be independent ... Do you think a seventh level venerable sovereign, the master of a major world, would be willing to submit to someone else? They've even given up their control of the world and become someone else's subordinate ... Ask the seventh level venerable sovereigns in the eighth level world, who doesn't want to leave?"This was publicly acknowledged. He was not the son of the red moon Lord, so who would be willing to be his grandson?If he could leave, he would naturally leave.It was just that they didn't dare to leave now, and they couldn't leave either.However, this required a lot of things to be done.​ First, the red moon Lord would leave during this process and would not return quickly.Secondly, he had to advance to rank seven. Otherwise, a rank six venerable sovereign would not have much say.Third, neo martial's whereabouts had to be exposed ... Even if it was not exposed, it had to be sure that it was not nearby. Otherwise, no matter how bold red Moon Lord was, he would not dare to leave easily.Fourth, something must happen to the Crimson Moon or the entire chaos. Otherwise, it would be difficult to have such an opportunity.At this time, the forest orchid master had already begun to suspect. This time, she really suspected that this person was a powerhouse from neo martial.The Scarlet Sun World, the scorching sun World ... The possibility was low. It was more likely that this person was from the neo martial world.While he was still thinking, Li Hao smiled and said,"I understand now, sector Lord!" Don't worry, realm Lord, I won't cause any trouble for Senlan ... Also, I'd like to ask you one more small question. If Senlan forcefully breaks away from the Crimson Moon after merging with it, will it cause a disturbance in the Dao?"Sector Lord Sen Lan's expression changed!The great Dao was in turmoil ...You, a 4th rank, really ask a lot.He was silent for a long time before he nodded."I will! But as long as the red moon master is still here, the unrest will be suppressed sooner or later!"As he said this, he became a little solemn and said in a deep voice,""Also, don't place your hopes on seizing the great Dao universe. As long as the level eight master is still around, no one can take it away unless they kill him!"These people couldn't be thinking of seizing the great path universe, right?That's impossible!Unless he killed Red Moon master. If he could kill her ... Why did he have to resort to such petty tricks? At this moment, he was having a headache.There were some things that were better left unknown.It was actually very good to pretend to be confused.However, once it was exposed, it would be very troublesome.For example, at this moment ... Even if he guessed that Li Hao came from neo martial arts, he would not take action, care, ask, or reveal it to the world of the Crimson Moon ... Otherwise, it would be Sen LAN joining hands with neo martial arts to kill the Crimson Moon Emperor. He could not afford to bear this responsibility.At that time, Senlan would be destroyed and directly annexed instead of being incorporated!Therefore, he could only hope one thing now ... This guy, don't say anything more. Don't tell me that you're from neo martial arts. Otherwise, he'll really be in trouble!The sorrow of the weak!If he was strong, he could do whatever he wanted. However, he was only at the sixth rank. He didn't have the qualifications or capital to offend anyone."If the sector Lord wishes to advance to the 7th step, what other conditions do you need?"Li Hao suddenly changed the topic and asked something he shouldn't have asked. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  At this moment, the forest orchid sector Lord was truly silent.He didn't say a word.What, you want to help me advance?Do you have the ability?Or ... Are you trying to test my strength?Seeing that he didn't answer, Li Hao understood his concerns and explained,""If it's just the power of a rank six venerable sovereign's great Dao ... I can think of a way. I can even prevent the realm Lord from personally taking action to avoid causing trouble and attracting the red moon's revenge. I can also ... Take care of a portion of the rank six venerable sovereigns!"When he said this, he became even more meaningful."Even ... The peak of the sixth step! That's not a problem!"“……”艹!Sector Lord Sen LAN cursed in his heart, neo martial artist!Definitely!Peak of the sixth step ... Only red moon's group could do that. Of course, it might not be just Red moon's group. These guys might want to capture all the sixth step cultivators in forest orchid in one go.What were they plotting?He had a splitting headache!"Of course, there's also a condition," Li Hao said."You need to cooperate with us, sector Lord ... If someone kills a large number of level six venerable sovereigns, the level eight venerable sovereigns might come in person! At this time, the sector Lord must advance, not only must he advance, he must also ... Make an escape posture! One side has just advanced and can take in a powerhouse of the seventh step, while the other side has killed a powerhouse of the sixth step. Will the eighth step choose to stay and take in the other side, or ... Chase after them?"Sector Lord Sen Lan's mouth was dry,"this ... Normally, a Type 6 can't escape the slaughter of a type 8. They will be killed very quickly. Such a situation wouldn't happen."

2919 Chapter 480
"Then ... What if it's not an ordinary sixth-rank?" Li Hao laughed.What about a sixth-rank beast that could kill a seventh-rank beast?At this moment, sector Lord Sen LAN had a guess. Sword Saint!'Damn it!'Indeed, it was possible that venerable the sword was hiding in the forest region. His head was about to explode.Even though he had told himself not to ask, not to think, and not to care ... At this moment, he couldn't help but whisper,""Who ... Who killed that person?"Wake up, who killed him?"I don't know." Li Hao shook his head, confused.Sector Lord Sen LAN cursed in his heart!Bastard!Was there the base camp of new martial arts here, or ... Was there only venerable the sword?He pondered Li Hao's words. These people must have a plan.But ... If he didn't have to kill those sixth stage venerable sovereigns, including Hong Yue's ... This was not a bad idea.After a while, he took a deep breath and said,""Five, just five tier 6 ... Or ... Four would do! As long as I have this much, I will definitely be able to advance successfully!""Furthermore, there's no need to prepare. I can advance instantly!"At least four, or it wouldn't be enough.He might be able to advance successfully, but he would need a lot of time. No one would give him the time."Just four?"Li Hao was puzzled. Not much.Forest orchid master was speechless!Not many?A lot, alright!"There are probably more than four level 6s in the boundary, right?" Li Hao said.What were they waiting for?Let's just start fighting!Sector Lord Sen LAN shook his head,"it's best if it's a level 6 from a great world or a level 6 rogue cultivator ... The energy and Grand DAOs are a little messy!" I know that there are more than four rank sixes in the realm, but many of them come from middle-level worlds and there are also itinerant cultivators. There are not many rank sixes from the great worlds. "So, they needed Red moon's help?It would be best if there were four at the sixth level of the Crimson Moon?Li Hao's heart moved.At this moment, he already had an idea. He said,""I need senior Yan Fang to help me deter the others. In addition, I will find someone to help me deal with these new red Moon sovereign! Kill two fifth rank venerable sovereigns first, leave the sixth ... Let the other party feel the pressure and know that those below the sixth rank are useless. It's better to have a few more sixth rank venerable sovereigns ..."Ask for help?Venerable sword?If that was the case, it wouldn't be a Tier 6!Sector Lord Sen LAN had a headache."If that person ... If he makes a move, he won't be able to hide it from others. I'm afraid it won't be a Grade 6 but a Grade 7!"Don't forget, Hong Yue still has a seventh-rank! "It's not that person!"Li Hao shook his head and denied this.Who was it?It was empty!As for the Sen LAN sector Lord, his body was frozen. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  It was really like seeing a ghost!How many of you have infiltrated the forest great world?Moreover, from his tone, there was at least one rank six being who had the ability to kill a rank five venerable sovereign in front of a rank six ... This was not a weak rank six.In addition to venerable sword, were there also top venerable emperors like venerable blood Emperor in neo martial?At this point, it was a little clear.However, neither of them mentioned neo martial or venerable the sword.A tacit understanding!Sector Lord Sen LAN quickly judged the pros and cons. Once I reach Level 7, I won't have to kill Red Moon Emperor myself. I'll merge with the red moon, and if the situation Li Hao described really happens ... If Red Moon Emperor is entangled by someone or can't return, I can escape.He would take Senlan with him and leave this place as the Lord of an independent major world.It seemed that there were no losses for him, only benefits.And ... The key point was that if he agreed this time, he might be able to resolve some enmity with new martial. In fact, there was no enmity. The only enmity was that his Daoist master had followed the human King and was hacked to death by someone!Was this considered a grudge?Many thoughts flickered through his mind. Finally, sector Lord Sen LAN spoke,""I don't know about this, young friend, please do as you please! Also...Are you sure you want to integrate into my forest orchid world?""I'm sure!"Li Hao nodded.If they didn't integrate, how could they join the Crimson Moon?If they didn't join the red moon, what would they do next?At this moment, Li Hao already had a complete plan and a complete idea ... He needed the cooperation of venerable the sword, solitary sword, Sen LAN, and Tian Fang. Only then would he be able to move the giant Crimson Moon with the strength of a rank 4!As for Tian Fang, he still lacked a promise ... Perhaps it was time to fulfill his promise to Wu Shan.Once the tianfang great path universe opened, Wushan entered, and a level Seven venerable sovereign entered a level nine great path universe ... Could Red Moon master really sit still? If it was possible ... Would Wu Shan be pleasantly surprised if he sent the human Emperor into the palace?At that time, the red moon master would probably stop the human King without even bothering about the great world!If I don't go and create the Skylands major world, it'll be very hard for the primordial chaos to become chaotic.I still have to open it!Li Hao also quickly planned."This time, I'll have to raid the red moon's lair to satisfy the needs of venerable the sword and me. Otherwise, a mere Level 6 great world, poor and dejected, won't be enough for us to fill the gaps between our teeth!"At this moment, he had already thought it through and said,""These three have merged into the forest orchid! However, there's one thing. If anything happens to me, I hope that you can protect them ..."Sector Lord Sen LAN had a headache. If he was a new martial artist, he wouldn't be able to protect him!"Don't worry, realmlord. The three of them are simple. Just Yi and Chan Xiu were forced to join, but this one ..."Li Hao pointed at King Huai and smiled.""Rank two, disappeared from the Crimson Moon region, came from somewhere ..."
