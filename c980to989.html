        derground palace.
         Two people and a tree were communicating.
         Of course, Liu Long didn't really understand what he was hearing. If they weren't communicating with their minds, he wouldn't have been able to understand them if they were simply using the ancient language. But now, it was better because he had the divine intent, so he could sense a thing or two.
         Li Hao communicated with them for a while and then hesitantly glanced at the palace in the distance.
         He suddenly said,"senior tree, a win-win cooperation is the result I hope to see. However, I'm not sure whether the cost and return can be proportional. It's different in the past and present, so ... I have an unreasonable request. I wonder if senior can agree to it?"
         "What?"
         "Senior said that you can gather energy and create a Holy Land for cultivation ... What does a Holy Land for cultivation look like? I still have some divine power stones. Can you show me some of them after you absorb them?"
         Then, Li Hao continued,"of course, if you absorb too much, senior, you may become very powerful. You may drive us away or even kill us. So, just in case ... I'll be a villain first, then a gentleman. I'll control the amount of divine power stones. If you can offer me a matching benefit, I naturally hope to cooperate with you."
         It would probably take a lot of energy to raise a tree.
         Looking at its situation, the divine power Stone might just be the most basic thing, but it still despised trash.
          But to Li Hao, it was already a treasure.
         It was true for everyone.
         If he put in too much effort but didn't gain much ... Then there was no need to talk about cooperation with the tree. Even if he didn't want to kill it, it would die without energy nourishment. Li Hao had some respect for the ancient civilizations, but it didn't mean that he would harm himself for the benefit of others.
         Since the other party could not bring him any benefits, Li Hao would not pay too much.
         As for this Palace ... As long as you're alive, I won't come and investigate, okay?
         But if you die, then I won't be polite.
         The tree demon seemed to be thinking about something. After a long time, it said,"Yes ... Monster plants, humans, and monsters are all win-win survival plans ..."
         "You can provide me with some energy stones first. I'll let you see the benefits of it ..."
         Li Hao considered for a while, gritted his teeth, and took out 100 divine power stones.
         Of course, they were not the ones in the Army, but the ones used for training. After several encounters, Li Hao had nearly 3000 divine power stones. One in the Army was equivalent to ten, so Li Hao had about 20 left.
         He couldn't bear to use these.
         If he fed these to the small sword, the sword energy that the small sword spat out would be more powerful. He couldn't waste them.
         In fact, the sapling was a little disdainful ... But at this moment, it was already good enough that it could absorb some. The amount of energy contained in 100 fruits was not small.
         Li Hao threw out a hundred divine power stones and didn't say anything.
         The reason why he took out so many divine power stones at once ... Was because he had no choice. These existences or inheritances from the ancient civilization had huge appetites. To them, 100 pieces of trash divine power stones seemed to be just a pile of ...
         Any less, and be careful that people will say you look down on it, and you will directly turn hostile.  As the divine power stones were thrown out, the little tree's roots extended and pierced into the divine power stones.
         The energy was instantly absorbed by the small tree.
         However, it was too little for little tree.
         This little bit of energy was like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood. It was a pity that the energy had burst out once before and it didn't have time to absorb too much. After that, Silver moon's energy had almost completely dissipated.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It had not absorbed much over the years.
         It was clear that it wasn't the only one absorbing the energy in Silvermoon City. Heaven battling city was also absorbing it. The little bit of energy that had been restored was not enough for them to absorb, so how could the Silvermoon people absorb energy?
         After absorbing some energy, the small tree was also thinking about something.
         After an unknown period of time, a faint special energy seeped out from the tree.
         It was very weak.
         When the special energy approached Li Hao, Li Hao subconsciously wanted to abandon it, but he soon realized something. After a moment of hesitation, he still absorbed a little.
         This little bit of absorption ... Li Hao suddenly had a special feeling.
         It felt like water from the spring of life ... Or rather, it was the same feeling he had when he first entered the bathhouse in heaven battling city. It was a comfortable and nourishing feeling.
         Beside him, Liu Long had also absorbed a little. Suddenly, he groaned in a low voice and transmitted his voice to Li Hao,""What a strange energy ..."
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
         This might be the special thing about these tree demons.
          However, in the next moment, the small tree's fluctuations came again.""Now, I'm already half-destroyed and only have some life energy scattered. This energy can speed up cultivation, prolong life, and heal internal injuries. All of these are actually secondary ..."
         Li Hao tilted his head. This was only secondary?
         Then what was the main point?
         "If you cultivate near me, I'll be able to release a trace of ancient Dao Origin Energy to help you cultivate."
         "Origin Energy?"
         Li Hao was somewhat confused. What was that?
         The sapling seemed to be shocked by his ignorance. After a long time, it continued,""Origin, the origin of martial arts, also the essence of martial arts ... In fact, I'm also very curious. You can say that it's strong, very strong, and weak, but it's also very weak ... But you ... Weren't your previous mental fluctuations a manifestation of the origin?"
         "The power of origin is the fundamental power of martial Dao. For example, the fierce tiger you showed before is a kind of Dao, but ... It seems to be a little different ... It's strange that you are different from the neo martial artists in my memory."
         It didn't know what to say.
         According to the standards of neo martial arts, Li Hao and the others were very special. Divine intent was not as simple as spiritual power. It even touched some of the origin of martial arts. Strictly speaking, these people had already embarked on a process of pursuing the pinnacle of martial arts.
        
         However ... In terms of strength, there was a huge gap.
         It didn't know how to describe it. It was just a demon, and a demon that had been passed down, not a great demon that had cultivated by itself. Otherwise, it could have explained some of Li Hao's doubts.
         Li Hao's expression changed slightly.
         He looked at little tree and suddenly thought of something.""Shi ... Mu Shi ... You're a tree ..."
         He suddenly brandished his sword, and the small tree instantly became alert.
         However, he soon let his guard down. Li Hao was practicing the Willow silk sword.
         A moment later, Li Hao stopped and asked,""Senior, what do you think of this sword technique?"
         The Willow catkin sword directly passed through the wood Force Sword.
         However, Li Hao didn't gain anything these days.
         Little tree's psyche fluctuated."This ... This seems to be the human swordsmanship of the neo martial era ... It's full of the flavor of that era. It's different from some of the martial arts you used before, right?"
          "Right!"
         Li Hao hurriedly said,"this, will it be of help to me in comprehending wood force?" Oh, it was just now ... Similar to a Tiger ..."
         He didn't know what to say.
         "You want to comprehend the wood sword principle?" the sapling pondered.
         "Right!"
         Li Hao nodded. That was more or less what he meant.
         "I don't know how to comprehend it ... But if you cultivate by my side and comprehend the energy of life and the origin of life, you might be able to experience it. It's a pity that my father has already passed away. Otherwise, my father would definitely ..."
         Li Hao's eyes lit up.
         Right now, what he felt most regretful about, but also the most urgent, was actually this point. He had not been able to use all five powers. Otherwise, what white shark Pirates? would he be afraid of them?
         "However, some of the power of the origin has seeped out, so we'll need a large number of energy stones ... The amount you've given us is far from enough!" The sapling added.
         "How much do you want?"
         "It's even more ... Harder than condensing life essence. I have to use at least three times the amount before a little of it can be dispersed."
         Li Hao was stunned.
         "Thirty ... Thirty thousand?"
         Don't f * cking mess around!
         You must be joking!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com 3000 military cultivation stones, wasn't that the kind of cultivation stones that could be found on the ground?
         You must be joking!
         "The power of origin is a power that is superior to a higher level," the small tree explained,"even I find it difficult to release it. Of course, there are other ways, such as killing ..."
         As it said that, it instantly shut up.
          As for Li Hao, he seemed to have realized something and looked at little tree.  At this moment, the atmosphere was heavy.
         Little tree might have only been passed down and had not experienced much tempering. He had just let it slip. Obviously, killing some humans or demons with Origin Energy might also leak out.
         The small tree no longer said anything.
         "Senior," Li Hao said,"what you mean is that after killing these existences with Origin Energy, it can overflow, right?"
         Little tree was silent for a while, but he still replied,""Not bad!"
         If this person wanted to kill him ... Then he would fight!
         Li Hao didn't continue. Instead, he asked,""Is there any other way? I'll use a small amount of energy in exchange for Origin Energy to help me comprehend Shi. I don't have any other requirements for Origin Energy ..."
         "You seem to have already comprehended several."
         The little tree continued."You're very strange ... Of course, there were some people like you in the neo martial era. If you want to comprehend more DAOs, you need to abandon the comprehension of other origin DAOs ... At that time, some big shots had unique ways to shield themselves."
         "I don't have many good ways to help you ... However, I can still release some Origin Energy. I don't need your so-called divine power Stone. There's another way ..."
         "What?"
         Li Hao was looking forward to it, but he was also worried that the conditions would be more troublesome.
         "You ... Seem to have some other divine weapons on you ..."
         "A divine weapon? An origin god weapon?"
         Li Hao was a little confused, but he still took out an origin god weapon. He had quite a lot on him-the windchimes of the Samsara King, Xu Feng's gloves and heart-protecting mirror, elder Fei Tian chiming's Black sword, and the earth-element armor he had obtained from killing a Yama leader.
         At this moment, Li Hao took out an earth-type armor.
         This thing had the lowest value.
         Of course, Li Hao also had a giant chariot divine boat, which was also an origin god weapon, but it was different from ordinary ones.
         "Not this one ..."
          The sapling seemed to have sensed something and transmitted,""If there's something suitable for me, such as a wood-type divine weapon, it can also provide me with a large amount of energy that I need. This is because divine weapons are all made from monster plants and monster corpses ..."
         Just as it said this, it seemed to know that it had said the wrong thing again!
         Sure enough, Li Hao was looking at the collapsed tree.
         The big tree was broken and collapsed.
         But the big tree didn't seem to be completely shattered. Did the little tree mean that it could absorb the power of the same element?
         As he was thinking, the little tree became restless."My father's remains have already turned into the defensive formation of the entire Palace. It can't be used. Even if it could, it can't be used. Don't think about it!"
         Li Hao hurriedly nodded."I understand. I'm just a little curious. Why ... Why is there a hole in this Palace?"
         Yes, if it was the same as heaven battling city, wouldn't it be difficult to enter?
         "You ... You don't understand."
         The little tree was helpless."If I didn't leave a crack, I wouldn't be able to absorb any energy. My father's metamorphosis sealed the entire Palace, which also caused me to be unable to absorb any more energy. I could only open a small crack to absorb some energy. I just didn't expect that opening it would attract you."
        
         "Can it be closed again?"
         "I can ... But after I close it, I will fall into a deep sleep again."
         The sapling seemed a little helpless."That person last time wasn't too strong and was intimidated by me. So I thought I could hold on for a while longer and absorb some energy storage. It's enough for me to use for a while ... In the end, you came and saw through the truth."
         Li Hao had seen it use up its divine power stones. Otherwise, Li Hao would have either left or called for more people to come back, just like golden spear.
         At this moment, Li Hao had many thoughts.
         He suddenly said,"senior tree, does that mean that some powerhouses like you can sleep until today?" For example, some powerhouses from the new martial era ..."
         "Why do I need to sleep?"
         Little tree was a little profound."Father was seriously injured. In addition, he needed to guard the palace, so he had to choose to sleep ... The powerhouses of the neo martial era would not choose to sleep. You don't understand!" "If there are, they're either in the same situation as me and can't go out, or they're too seriously injured, or they're doing their duty ... I understand what you mean. You're thinking if there are any strong people from the new martial era who haven't left with the human King ... Impossible. As long as they can fight, they'll leave!"
         As long as they could fight, they would leave.
         Li Hao silently experienced this feeling."Then ... Then the human Emperor didn't leave anyone behind to guard this land?"
          A tree could live for thirty thousand years without dying.
         Then, what about the other powerhouses from the ancient civilization?
         "I don't know. I don't think so ... From what I remember, if the human ruler can take care of his enemies by himself, he will go. If he can't ... He will go out in full force and won't let the powerful ones stay behind. However, the rear shouldn't be too dangerous ... If there are enemies, they will be wiped out at the front line. If there is chaos in the rear, it can only be internal strife or trouble caused by himself ..."
         "The human King's philosophy is that I annihilate the enemy outside. If the rear is in chaos and there is internal strife ... Then he deserves it. If he dies, he doesn't care. When he is kind, he can't bear to see the common people suffer. When he is ruthless ... Everyone will be afraid."
         Li Hao's interest was piqued.
         Ancient king!
         If it was the person in his memory, it would be interesting. When he killed people, he was extremely vicious.
         However, according to what little tree said, he pitied the common people.
         Of course, the other party used his full strength when he attacked. He didn't bring any people with him, and he didn't attack in full force. What was more interesting was that he didn't seem to be afraid of any trouble behind him. If there was any trouble ... He wouldn't care.
         "If there's chaos, that's internal strife. You guys can fight as you wish. He won't care even if everyone dies.
         Thinking of this ...
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. In any case, he had never heard of any invasion of foreign races, but there had been constant internal strife in the dynasty.
         He still wanted to ask a few more questions, but little tree said,""Don't mention too much about the human Emperor. It's best not to mention the names of these experts. If their real names are mentioned too much, they might be able to sense it even if they are separated by countless years and countless distances. However, it might not be a good thing to sense it. It might be a bad thing ... Because they might not be able to distinguish between friend and foe and use some means to directly curse and kill anyone who mentions his name. "
         Li Hao was stunned,'that's impossible, right? And countless years have passed ..."
         "Anything is possible!"
          "Perhaps this world has already been restricted a little," the little tree reminded."We can't mention their real names. It's also a form of protection to distinguish between friend and foe. If we mention their names now, we might be cursed to death!"  "If you have the same name ..."
         "You don't understand the profoundness of the great Dao!"
         Little tree didn't say anything else. Li Hao was too stupid ... No, he was too inexperienced. He didn't understand the logic behind this.
         Li Hao was helpless!
         He was used to it anyway. The ancient people often looked down on him, and now even ancient trees had the same meaning.
         Did this fellow still want him to save it?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "In other words, if I provide you with enough wood-elemental energy or wood-elemental origin weapons, you can release some Origin Energy for me to comprehend?"
         "Yes,"
         "Can I condense divine intent? They are the ones you saw just now. "
         "I don't know,"
         Alright!
         Anyway, he just had to try.
         As Li Hao thought about this, he took out a few other origin God weapons."Do you have anything suitable for you?"
         "No... But if you're willing, I can absorb a bit of it. I just need a lot of it to meet your needs ..."
          Li Hao sighed.
         A large amount of resources were needed to raise a small sword.
         Now, the tree needed it too.
         There was also Gou 'Zi, who could also eat to death.
         Li Hao discovered that his consumption was really nothing compared to theirs.
         However, if he could comprehend wood force, he wouldn't care even if he used up all five of his origin God weapons, let alone divine power stones.
         Nowadays, when you're strong, you're still afraid of not having these?
         If that didn't work, he could go to the Crimson Moon, the three major organizations, the nine divisions, the imperial family, the governor's mansion in Linjiang ... Or even pirates.
         In addition to these origin God weapons, Li Hao had also obtained a long saber from killing hai Sha. However, the saber was a little special. It didn't seem to be a simple origin god weapon. It was extremely strong and didn't have a weapon soul. Li Hao stored it and didn't use it for the time being.
         He took out the five origin God weapons.""How many do you think you need to absorb to provide some Origin Energy for me to comprehend? At the very least, let me try out the benefits of this special power. Otherwise, I don't have much motivation. "
        
         "I can try absorbing the earth monkey, the heart-protecting mirror, and the small black sword. The earth monkey should be made from the skin of an Earth Dragon, the black sword should be made from the corpse of a black Hellhound, and the heart-protecting mirror should be made from a splitting pangolin ..."
         The sapling analyzed the items and said,"the boxing gloves and the bell are of a higher grade, so it's easy to waste them. These three items are only made from the corpses of low-grade demons. You can try to absorb them."
         Li Hao knew that wind chimes had a high level.
         These gloves ... Were they of a high level?
         As Li Hao thought about it, he thought of the southern Fist. He seemed to have watched it for a long time last time, but he didn't pay much attention to it at the time. Could it be that he was interested in the southern Fist?
         Just too embarrassed to say it?
         Li Hao pondered for a while. He could give her some divine energy stones, but he could give her three origin God weapons. After she absorbed them, she might become much stronger. By then, she would be difficult to deal with.
         If they fell out with him, he might just be sending himself to his death.
         After some consideration, Li Hao said,"then I'll have my friends wait outside. Also, I'll ask a few friends to protect me. Is that okay?"
         Little tree was speechless.
          If you don't trust me, just say it.
         "My friends are stronger and more knowledgeable than me," Li Hao explained."They might have a better way to help you recover ..."
         "No need!"
         The little tree said directly,"you're just worried that I've absorbed too much energy. However, I don't want too many outsiders to come here. How about this? you don't enter first. Let the person beside you stay and comprehend it. If it's effective, you can decide again."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao looked at Liu Long. Liu Long smiled and nodded,""We can try. The benefits might be great! However, I'm a Water-type ..."
         This tree might be of the wood element or the life element.
         It might not be of much help to him.
         Also, this would consume an origin god weapon.
         Li Hao pondered for a while and suddenly said,"how about I let Li Heng in?" I'll explain the situation to him. He has also reached the completion of the 100 levels and has comprehended the wood Force Sword will. If it's of help, he might be able to reach the Qian warrior level. If he can't even reach the Qian warrior level, it means that he will be of limited help to me. "
         Liu Long pondered for a moment,"him?" That's fine, but ... You ... You're not worried?"
         Li Hao smiled."What's there to worry about? boss, didn't you say it before?" Joining us means that you are one of us. Besides, didn't I bring you all here to give some of you the hope of entering the thousand warrior class?"
         "That's true, I was too narrow-minded!"Liu Long laughed.
         Li Hao looked at little tree and said,"I still have some subordinates outside. One of them is cultivating the catkin sword and is weaker than us. I want him to enter. You can devour the origin god weapon and release some of your so-called Origin Energy so that he can comprehend it ... What do you think?"
         "As you wish."
         In fact, the small tree could sense some people outside.
         However, his strength didn't seem to be that great.  Li Hao didn't say anything more. He quickly left with Liu Long, stepping on the air.
         As soon as they left, the small tree swayed its branches and looked at the fallen tree not far away. It was clearly just a tree, but at this moment, it seemed as if its eyes were focused on the big tree.
         "Father ..."
         The little tree looked at the big tree, and finally looked at the castle not far away. Guarding the palace was its father's duty, but it was not its. Its father had already fallen, but it was still guarding the place.
         It could have left 20 years ago, but it never did.
         It was a sapling left behind by the old tree when it fell. It sprouted from the old tree's roots. Although it was said to be a descendant, it could also be considered a rebirth of the main body.
         Guarding this abandoned Palace seemed to have become its mission.
         If it could, it didn't want Li Hao to enter.
         However, at this moment, it was extremely weak, and this place had been discovered. If it did not quickly strengthen itself, more powerful people would come to explore.
         Even if this Palace had been abandoned and abandoned, it was still the palace of a Supreme existence in the past.
         He couldn't just let anyone enter!
         "So ... We can only cooperate ... He is the commander of heaven battling city, so I believe heaven battling city has not been completely destroyed yet. There is also an assessment mechanism. Since Huai Zhan was willing to give him a drop of his life essence, he should not have completely fallen. Perhaps he is also hoping that this person can find a chance of survival for him ..."
         The little tree thought to himself.
         Li Hao had thought that little tree would be willing to cooperate with anyone he met, but in fact, he had underestimated himself.
         If he hadn't taken out that drop of water from the spring of life, if he hadn't taken out the silver Dagger, if he hadn't taken out the starry sky sword ... What Li Hao would have faced would have been little tree's desperate struggle. The bloodline of the eight great families was sometimes useless and useless, but sometimes, it could be a stepping stone to many things.
          Without this bloodline, it would have been difficult for Li Hao to join heaven battling city. Without this bloodline, it would have been impossible for him to smoothly reach a cooperation agreement with little tree.
         ……
         In the cave.
         Everyone was waiting anxiously.
         At this moment, two figures returned, one after the other.
         Li Hao leaped up and looked at Li Heng in the crowd. Li Heng shivered at Li Hao's glance."Guild leader, why are you looking at me?"
         Why are you looking at me like that?
         "Do you want to enter the thousand warrior class?"
         Li Heng was taken aback, and so were the others. Liu Yan and the others were even more surprised. Why didn't you call us Li Heng instead of us when you had the chance ... Was there a need to take care of someone with the same surname?
         Li Heng was also stunned, and then he hurriedly said,""Of course I want to, but it's very difficult to build up my power ... Guild leader, do you have a way?"
        
         Breaking through 100 to the thousand combat realm was just a little. It was enough as long as the momentum was strong enough to transform.
         However, this process would often last for many years.
         For example, Yuan Shuo had been in this state for many years, and so had the others. Liu Long, on the other hand, had directly entered the warrior of the thousand seat, but it was also because he had external help.
         "Yes, but it's very dangerous!"
         "Yes!" Li Hao said directly,"a tree demon has reached an agreement with me. He can provide us with some ways to strengthen our influence!" "Of course, the price to pay is also very high. Using an origin god weapon as fuel ... I'm not distressed about this, but I'm worried that it has other plans. Thus, I need someone to go down and test it out first. I'll make a decision after seeing the results ..."
         "Bang!"
         With a loud bang, Li Heng directly stomped on the ground and rushed towards the hole."Guild leader, let me test the waters for you ..."
         After he finished speaking, he had already jumped down!
         Li Hao was speechless. He looked at Liu Long, then at the others. At this moment, the others were also speechless. This guy ... Li Hao hadn't even finished speaking, but as if he was afraid that he wouldn't have a chance, he directly jumped down!
         "I ... Forget it!" Li Hao had a headache.
          I haven't even finished, why are you jumping around!
         He wanted to remind this guy to be careful and keep an eye on that tree, but he had already jumped down, so what could he say?
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He threw the earth monkey into the hole."Senior, let's try absorbing it first. If it's not enough, we'll talk again."
         If an origin god weapon wasn't enough for him to comprehend over 100 points, Li Hao would have to wonder if it was worth it.
         The small tree did not respond.
         p Below, it also quieted down and there was no movement.  After a long time, there seemed to be a slight change below. Li Hao felt a surge of energy rise, but it quickly disappeared.
         Just like that, after about an hour, Li Hao became a little anxious. With a serious expression, he began to consider whether he should continue attacking ...
         At this time, a figure suddenly appeared!
         Li Heng landed on the ground unsteadily. Li Hao glanced at him, and his expression changed slightly.
         That's right, Li Heng had broken through to the warrior of thousands!
         Li Heng, on the other hand, was somewhat at a loss and in a daze. Only when he saw Li Hao did he come back to his senses and say in a daze,""Guild leader ... This ... Did I cheat?"
         "Hmm, how do you feel?"
         "I don't know,"
         Li Heng said in a daze,"I didn't feel anything. It was like ... I went into darkness and saw a road. It was a very narrow road. Then, I vaguely saw some people fighting, trees, and demons ... Then ... I woke up and entered the warrior's instinct. I didn't feel anything."
         Li Hao frowned. That's it?
         It was that simple?
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After thinking for a while, Li Hao didn't say anything more. He didn't let Liu Long follow him, but jumped down alone.  ……
         At this moment, the small tree was no longer crystal clear, and it seemed to be a little dispirited.
         "The people of your era are very strange ... I originally thought that I could guide you to the path of origin, but in fact, I can't ... Perhaps the path you're walking is different from the one we took back then ..."
         'We' was not referring to it, but the memories it had inherited. It was almost a copy of the old tree.
         "However, the essence of martial arts is still similar. Different paths lead to the same destination, and all paths lead to one. In the end, it's still the same ...
         "What do you think of the effect?"
         Li Hao nodded and said,"very good!" If he were to rely on his own cultivation without any external help, he would need at least 10 years to have the hope of stepping into the Dou Qian class. "
         10 years was considered a basic amount.
         Yuan Shuo hadn't been able to enter the thousand warrior stage for decades ... Of course, this was related to the fusion of his Five Forces.
         Li Hao felt that it was worth it to exchange an origin god weapon for a warrior Qian.
         After thinking for a while, Li Hao no longer hesitated. He threw out the two remaining origin God weapons."Can you let some of it overflow and let me comprehend it?"
         "You can ... But you can't be immersed in my Dao for too long. What's mine isn't yours. You can comprehend some, but you can't copy it. Otherwise, you won't be able to go far ..."
         Li Hao didn't say anything and just waited in silence.
         A moment later, the little tree absorbed the two origin God weapons into his body and they disappeared.
         And a special fluctuation slowly seeped out.
         Li Hao didn't hesitate and decided to give it a try.
          Of course, he never put down the sword in his hand.
         He didn't really trust this tree.
         Gradually, his vision turned dark, and soon, it was as if he had fallen into darkness. Just as Li Heng had said, in this dark place, a path appeared.
         Li Hao was stepping on this road at this moment.
         On the muddy path, some figures seemed to appear.
         Li Hao's mind was still clear. The gathering of the powerful divine will made him even more clear-headed. He looked carefully and seemed to see something. He saw a towering tree slowly growing.
         There wasn't much magnificence, only ordinary and dull.
         It was planted next to the palace. One year, a wretched old man came to the palace. Then, the old man took out a cat ... A cat-like fruit and fed it to the tree.
         "You're quite lucky to be able to grow here. However, the reason I'm here is to announce that this Palace is going to be abandoned. The battle is intense, and the great emperor probably won't come again. Otherwise, you'd have a great opportunity to grow here. What a pity ..."
         Then, he fed a fruit to the tree and said,""I'll give you a cat fruit. Try it and you'll have a chance to walk your own path. I'll take my leave first. If someone patrols the area and asks you about this, tell them that you've eaten five ... No, ten of my cat fruits!"
        
         The old man patted the tree."As an old senior, it's not easy for me either. I've been caught and chopped all day long, and I'm almost bald. Finally, I have an excuse to keep a few more. Do you remember that?"
         At that time, the big tree seemed to be a little confused, but it still swayed, indicating that it remembered.
         The old man laughed, revealing his yellow teeth. He patted the tree again."You have a bright future. I'll be leaving first. Oh right, although this place is abandoned, don't let anyone in ... Watch out, in case it becomes a mess ..."
         After that, the old man disappeared.
         That was probably the most memorable thing on this tree's path of martial arts. It was also the thing it was most proud of and the most fated thing.
         An old man had given it a fruit.
         From then on, the giant tree grew rapidly and became stronger. As the palace guards left, it became the only guard, the only Guardian of this abandoned Palace. This was because the old man had said that even if it was abandoned ... No one was allowed to enter.
         At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have turned into a tree and grown with it.
         The wind and rain, the sun and the rain, day after day, year after year.
         While he was experiencing and comprehending, Li Hao's vision suddenly blurred.
          The small tree appeared in front of him again, and it looked even weaker than before. The small tree seemed to be looking at Li Hao."Your eyes ..."
         Li Hao was dazed. At this moment, countless images appeared in his mind. He shook his head and said in surprise,""Eyes?"
         Little tree didn't know how to describe it. At this moment, Li Hao's eyes were no different from usual.
         However, little tree felt that something was different.
         After a long while, he said,"you have to be careful of your eyes. This could be the delusion-breaker eye or the sword eye ... Your ancestor was said to be extremely powerful. The path he took was different from ours. In the past, he broke his own origin Dao. Strictly speaking ... The current you guys might have been affected by him and no longer walk the origin Dao. Instead, you are walking a unique martial Dao."
         Li Hao listened attentively. Little tree continued,""You can study your eyes more ... Also, the divine weapon you've given me can only allow me to release these. If I continue, my essence will be damaged!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He just nodded and fell silent.
         At this moment, he was still silently comprehending everything that he had seen earlier. The image was not the key. The key was that he seemed to have substituted himself into it and turned into a tree, growing continuously. This was the core.
         Li Hao brandished the starry sky sword, and the Willow catkin sword floated out.
         Sword after sword, he vaguely had some comprehension, but it was not so direct and straightforward. He always felt that there was something else in the haze.
         It was very difficult to break!
         If he broke through, perhaps he could comprehend wood force.
         After a long time, when Li Hao woke up, little tree's spiritual waves fluctuated. "Don't be anxious. This is very normal. You've comprehended many Dao paths. You'll be able to comprehend them after coming here a few times. "
         Li Hao smiled bitterly.
         This consumption was unusually large. He had destroyed three origin God weapons at once. Even a Prince would not squander like this!
         How many had he broken since he started cultivating?
         The small sword had absorbed a few origin God weapons.
         Li Hao took a deep breath and suppressed his emotions.""Senior, can you leave this place?"
         "No, I need to guard this place,"
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He thought of the scene he had vaguely seen before. Back then, it was just a casual sentence from a wretched old man, but little tree's father had guarded this place for 30000 years!
         Up until little tree's generation, he was still carrying out his father's task. It had to be said that these demons were sometimes one-track minded and were worthy of admiration.
         "So if I want to find senior, I can only come here?"
         "Not bad."
         The little tree continued,"if you can provide me with enough energy, I can seal that passage. Father's metamorphosis has sealed this place. As long as this passage is closed, no one can enter ... You can let people enter here to cultivate. You can also come over at any time as long as you can provide enough energy."
         In other words, if Li Hao wanted to, he could make this place his personal secret place.  However, this place was a little far from the White moon City, about five to six hundred li.
         Of course, if he became stronger, he would be able to travel faster.
         Li Hao glanced at the castle in the distance.""Senior, this place has already been abandoned. I ... I also saw some things. When that old man came back then, he seemed to have taken some things away. This place is probably an empty house. Why ..."
         "I don't know, but father said we can't leave, so we can't leave."
         Li Hao was helpless!
         In fact, he still wanted to bring this tree out. After all ... He felt that this tree was not weak. It seemed to be very weak before, probably due to insufficient energy.
         Even so, the Golden spear couldn't do anything to it. Li Hao wouldn't have dared to fight it head-on if he hadn't seen through it.
         He was still very powerful!
         He calculated for a while and felt that he was too poor. Otherwise, he could condense the water of the spring of life and continuously enter the scene just now to grow with the small tree. Perhaps he would be able to comprehend wood force.
         He still had some origin God weapons, but Li Hao had just absorbed some and hadn't completely digested them yet. He couldn't waste them, so he decided to come again next time.
         "By the way, senior, that cat-like fruit ..."
         "That's a treasure, but I'm afraid it's long been lost. It's the companion of a senior expert. That person is actually a monster plant ..."
         Li Hao was startled. Monster plant?
         That old man?
         "Senior, you mean that demons can transform into humans?"
         "Of course, it's easier for the monster race, and it's more difficult to plant monsters ... But there's still hope for both."
         Li Hao was deep in thought. He thought of the dog outside.
         That Black Panther could also turn into a human?
         It was a little scary. How scary was it when a dog turned into a human?
         "Senior, I still have some divine power stones here for you to absorb. I'll let my subordinates come in to cultivate. Is that okay?"
         "Of course!"
         Little tree had no reason to refuse. After all, by absorbing some of Li Hao's subordinates, he could actually ... Fill his own pocket and help himself recover. This was something that both parties had agreed on.
         Otherwise, little tree would be a fool to cooperate with Li Hao.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao obviously understood this.
          As for Li Hao, he also wanted to see the effects of training here. Also, the energy provided by the small tree seemed to be similar to the energy after the sword energy had been neutralized. This meant that Li Hao might no longer need to be a middleman.
         Every time everyone cultivated, he had to be the medium of transfer. This was not a good thing.
         After a while, Li Hao called everyone and they all entered this place to train.
         He also took out a large number of divine power stones.
         Of course, the others were fine, but when Gou 'Zi entered this place, the small tree seemed to be a little vigilant. Even if it was just a tree, Li Hao could see the other party's vigilance.
         As if she was afraid of the dog, she sneaked into the palace when it wasn't paying attention.
         In fact, the Black Panther really wanted to sneak in, but it was driven away by the small tree several times.
         As for the Black Panther, it could only lie on the ground helplessly. It looked at the palace and fell into deep thought. In its memories ... Some things seemed to have emerged. This place, or rather, this cat-like Palace, in the past, or perhaps countless years ago, my ancestors should have been able to enter and leave as they pleased.
         Gou 'Zi looked at the palace and then at the tree ...
         A little memory deep in its bloodline was awakened. In the past, its ancestors seemed to like to build a tree. It didn't know if it was because the memory was very vague. The mark on its bloodline made it think of many things.
        
         In the relic, Li Hao took out a large number of divine power stones and gave them to the small tree. The small tree overflowed with energy and helped people cultivate.
         As for Li Hao, he was recalling everything he had learned.
         It turned into a tree and grew together with the small tree.
         The Willow catkin sword gradually gained some flavor.
         However, he still lacked some clues regarding the wood Force Sword intent.
         The fifth force was too difficult.
         At this moment, Li Hao somewhat understood why his teacher would find people to spar with. Perhaps only by looking for people and sparring with them could one continuously improve their Shi. Otherwise, it would be difficult to comprehend the fifth move through bitter cultivation.
         After an unknown amount of time, Li Hao's armor suddenly emitted a fluctuation.
         Soldier Kong Jie requested to make a call.
         Kong Jie!
          Previously, Li Hao had given him a suit of armor. At this moment, he was less than 500 kilometers away from white moon City, so he could indeed communicate. However, Li Hao could contact Kong Jie directly, but Kong Jie could contact him without Li Hao's permission.
         After a moment of hesitation, Li Hao picked up the communication.
         "Secretary Kong, what's wrong?"
         p He had only left the White moon City not too long ago. Could it be that the White shark Pirates had attacked?  It can't be, right?
         "Just now, there was news from the East. Five hours ago, the light sword went crazy and launched an attack in the Duke dingguo's mansion. It killed five generals of the dingguo Army and took away the Duke dingguo's mansion's legacy treasure. Right now, it seems that he's still alive. He's escaping all the way to the North ..."
         Li Hao was stunned.
         "Isn't she a person from the Duke dingguo's mansion?"
         "Silver Moon Martial Master ... Who would be willing to be someone's grandson? Silver Moon people, only silver Moon people can suppress them, like your master, the Duke of dingguo is obviously not one of them. "
         "Oh!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything, but he was confused. Why are you telling me?
         To the North ...
         Could it be ...
         Li Hao suddenly thought of something. He recalled what the light sword had said that day and smiled.
         It was possible.
         That day, the other party had threatened him and asked him to help her once to suppress the rebellion in her body. From the looks of it, it was very likely that she had killed him after unsealing last night ...
         But it's been five hours.
         Even if he didn't die, he had become a superpower. That's good. There's no use looking for me. After such a long time, there's no hope.
         Besides, the East was far from here.
         Even for top-tier powerhouses, from the East to the North, although it was not as close as the central region, it was still close to ten thousand miles in a straight line. Even if the light sword was unleashed to its maximum, it could fly three hundred miles in an hour, which would take at least a day and a half.
         Kong Jie didn't say anything and continued,""Last night, the light sword killed five top powerhouses with one strike. Four of them were at the late stage of the rising light realm, and one was even close to the metamorphosis stage. What a terrifying fellow ... According to my judgment, he might have unlocked five of the superpower locks. "
         What a ruthless man!  Li Hao was speechless. This was really ruthless!
         No wonder he was so powerful, killing five generals with one strike. One should know that even Hong Yitang, who had unlocked one or two super locks, could not kill an existence close to the transformation stage in an instant. If he could, the four great demons of the Cang Mountain would have suffered.
         However, if he could unseal five of them, then there would be no problem.
         Nan Quan had also said that after the light sword was unsealed, it should be slightly stronger than him.
         "As for the treasure that the light sword took away ... It's not easy for us to determine what it is, but according to some records, the Xu family helped the imperial family to ascend to the top of the world and was famous for their speed ... So, we speculate that it might be the Liu family's divine weapon recorded in the leg of the Liu family ..."
         Li Hao's eyes flickered.
         Was it?
         However, Li Hao still didn't understand why Kong Jie was looking for him.
         "What you're saying is that Silver Moon is interested in this divine weapon?"
         "It's inevitable that they'll be interested. There are too many people who are interested, and I'm afraid many of them want to take the opportunity ... The news of the light sword's death hasn't come yet, so it might still be alive. If that's the case, it must be in a state of great injury or even death. Once they receive the news, I'm afraid many people will head there ..."
         "Then the Secretary can go take a look."
         "We can't just leave like that ..."
         Kong Jie finally got to the point."Even if we leave, we won't be of much use. I remember that the southern Fist and the earth-covered sword were unsealed before ... In the end, we're fine." Also, you obtained a drop of the spring of life in the ruins ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Soldier Kong Jie, your superior has hung up the communication!"
         Just as he was saying this, he suddenly heard a voice.
         Kong Jie was stunned.
         "F * ck!" He couldn't help but curse.
         I'm not done yet!
         Li Hao actually hung up on him.
         'This guy, this courage, this ... I really want to beat him up.'
         ……
          In the open space in front of the castle.
         Li Hao was speechless.
         What was she thinking?
         He understood what Kong Jie meant. She wanted him to Save the Light sword and help her suppress the five superpower locks. If he could not, he would use the water of life to save her life. What a joke.
         To Li Hao, one drop of the water of the spring of life was equivalent to 10000 divine power stones.
         He had to suppress five of them. Last time, Nan Quan only unsealed four of them and not all of them were broken. He had to treat them on the spot and it cost him more than three thousand divine power stones.
         Because of this, Nan Quan was in debt.
         Li Hao must be out of his mind to save her. Besides, there was still hatred.
         Li Hao was quite fond of the Silver Moon Martial Master, but ... His enemies weren't among them.
         For example, people like Ying Hongyue and the dead Green Moon. The light sword didn't attack him because she didn't have the chance. On that day, she had Southern Fist and earth overturning sword, and they were in the city. The two gold-tier Warriors were also there. Li Hao wasn't afraid of her at all.
        
         Therefore, Li Hao had no interest in saving the person who had threatened him.
         Of course, if she really came here ... Since Li Hao had promised, he would save her. But the condition was that ... She had to pay for it herself. He had promised to help her suppress the riot, but he didn't promise to pay for it.
         The key was that he couldn't come.
         Li Hao chuckled. According to the time, even if the other party frantically fled in this direction, it would take at least a day and a night before they arrived at Silver Moon. By then, they would have been long dead.
         "The eight great families" weapons?"
         This was what Li Hao was interested in. Director Wang also asked Li Hao to collect these.
         These were all very important tokens and keys.
         The Liu family's weapon was in the Xu family's hands?
         Li Hao fell into deep thought.
         He then glanced at Liu Long, who was also cultivating not far away. The captain's surname was also Liu, and could be considered one of the more famous families in Silver City with the surname Liu. However, it seemed that he didn't have much connection with the Liu family of the eight great families.
          While he was thinking, Li Hao heard another call.
         Kong Jie was still calling him.
         Li Hao only had the communication system of his armor. He couldn't contact anyone else.
         Li Hao frowned. What was Kong Jie thinking?
         He clearly knew that he had a grudge against the radiant sword.
         After thinking for a while, she accepted the call and said,""Silver Moon needs the radiant sword alive. It's best if she can live perfectly and bring her back to Silver Moon ... It's not suitable for us to take action directly, and it won't be of much use if we do. In the end, we'll have to ask you for help. We can pay a certain price!"
         "I'm not interested!"
         Li Hao rejected her directly."She threatened me before. I don't have many friends, and I don't need them. I'm not interested in turning enemies into friends."
         "A sword stele!"
         "What?"
         Li Hao was puzzled, but Kong Jie said directly,"I'll use a sword stele in exchange for you to save someone. It was left behind by a top swordsman. There are sword words left behind by the swordsman." We dug it out from an archaeological ruin. When we dug it out, there were even remnants of sword Qi, which almost killed a sunrise realm expert. It's a very useful treasure for you. "
         The sword stele.
         "Is there a signature?" Li Hao asked after some thought.
         He wanted to know if it was left behind by one of the top swordsmen he knew. If it wasn't ... He was not interested.
         "There are!"
         "It's signed off with one word ... Li!"
         "It might have been left behind by your ancestors," he said with a smile.
         Is that true?
          Li Hao didn't believe it.  When it came to surnames, li was the most common surname. There were too many people with the same surname.
         While Li Hao was still thinking, Kong Jie said,""If you can Save the Light sword, she will definitely repay you. With her strength, she can help you do a lot of things that you can 't. The light sword is one of the few Silver Moon martial masters who have a mild temper. They practice the light sword and are very straightforward in their work."
         Li Haojing declined."Director, you've said so much. You can do it yourself. If you can really bring her back and provide enough divine power stones, I'll help her suppress it."
         In fact, he was a little puzzled. Since you want to save people, with your strength, who can stop you?
         He would just go directly!
         Why are you talking nonsense with me?
         I'm only a Martial Master at the middle stage of the rising light realm. If you let me go, wouldn't I be killed by an expert?
         'It's hard to shake off the enemy even when the light sword is in full swing, so it's definitely not weak. I'm going to die?'
         Of course, if Yuan Shuo was the one being hunted down, Li Hao would have immediately gone there without anyone urging him. The point was that the person being hunted was the light sword, whom he didn't have a good relationship with. He was naturally not interested in taking the risk.
         Kong Jie sighed."We can't do it. We are too big a target. Let's put it this way, many people are actually watching us. Once we disappear for too long, we will soon be watched, especially at this sensitive time. After old hou left, although Silver Moon seems calm, in fact, everyone's eyes are on us."
         "As for you, you don't have an official position, and you don't need to appear in official events, so you can do whatever you want ..."
         "State your conditions!" Kong Jie said directly. "We want to Save the Light sword. Next ... There might be a huge change in the Silver Moon. We need a Martial Master with the strength of the light sword! If you go, the danger won't be too great. Besides, if you can really Save the Light sword and help her suppress the violent movements in her body and the danger of her five internal organs being crushed, she will have enough strength to deal with some trouble herself ..."
         I state my conditions?
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. Adventuring, exploring ruins, and fighting Pirates, weren't they all for the sake of improving their strength?
         And now, he had a chance to improve.
         However, the gap was too big.
         " 100 origin divine weapons ..."
          "Li Hao, don't mess around!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com " 100000 divine power stones!"
         Li Hao spoke again. It seemed that many divine energy stones were needed to comprehend the origin Dao once. Little tree said that it was three times the amount needed to condense the water of the spring of life. Did that mean that it was 30000 divine energy stones?
         With 100,000 Yuan, if he comprehended it three times, he might be able to comprehend the fifth stance.
         "Stop joking."
         ? Kong Jie was about to break down.
         Li Hao was speechless. After a long while, he said,"how about this? all 10 origin divine weapons must be wood-type origin divine weapons. There's no limit to their grade!" Divine power stones ... 30000 pieces, all of which are wood-type!"
         "Li Hao! We don't have that many resources. If we did, Silver Moon would not be in his current state. "
         "Secretary, then forget it."
         Li Hao didn't believe it. The reason he didn't believe it was because these people must have excavated many ruins in Silver Moon. There must be a lot of good stuff hidden there.
        
         Or ... Silver Moon might have a powerful Martial Master Army in the dark.
         Definitely!
         This was Li Hao's guess, because hou Xiaochen's side had already trained the Wei Wu Army. He didn't believe that the others weren't prepared and didn't take any action.
         Silver Moon had his own thoughts.
         He dared to be independent just by relying on a few powerhouses?
         Experts were powerful, but they couldn't be omnipotent and couldn't split themselves. Didn't they need manpower to guard the major cities?
         There were only a few of the three suns ... And they dared to be independent?
         What a joke!
         These guys were definitely hiding people. As for where they were, it was simple. Heaven battling city, a small castle, which place was not suitable for hiding people?
         If Li Hao wanted to, the Wei Wu Army would be hiding here without anyone knowing.
          Also, Yuan Shuo had led the night patrollers to dig up a batch of ruins, but didn't they have any big gains?
         Li Hao didn't believe it either.
         Thus, Silver Moon and the others must be frighteningly rich, and they were only pretending to be poor.
         With his strength, he had led the Wei Wu Army and killed a few people. Now, almost all of them had broken through to the perfect hundred. There was even the first Qian master.
         What about those old guys?
         Director Zhao and the others had been the leaders of the Silver Moon for decades.
         And it was their home ground!
         They had excavated countless remains.
         Kong Jie was exhausted."Li Hao, you want so many resources. The people under you won't be able to use them all ..."
         "Secretary, saving people consumes a lot of energy. Last time we saved Southern Fist, we used up tens of thousands of divine power stones. If you don't believe me, you can ask senior Southern Fist. This time, the light sword's condition is more serious. "Also, why do I need a wood-type weapon? it's because only wood-type weapons can save people. I'm not using it for my own cultivation. The wood-type weapon is also for this reason. Her condition is too serious. Even a wood-type divine power Stone might not be useful. Only by using it can I save her."
         Kong Jie's head hurt. This was too much.
         It was so much that he began to consider if it was worth it.
         To Save the Light sword and consume so much energy ... It was simply too extravagant!
         Can you take it out?
         It could!
         However, those were strategic resources, used for battle preparation, and would be of great use later on. They were not spent to save a person.
         "Secretary, take your time to think about it. Let me know when you're done."
         There was no time to think about it slowly!
          "Go over there first," Kong Jie said in a deep voice."I'll discuss it with someone and give you an answer. But you can leave now. If you can't ... You can come back in time!"  "I'm busy!"
         Li Hao hung up the communication again. I'm not stupid. I won't do it.
         To think that you'd even think of getting me to save the radiant sword.
         Since that was the case, he would just bleed.
         ……
         At this moment, Kong Jie looked at the others and felt a headache,""He has stated his conditions. Ten wood-type origin God weapons, thirty thousand divine power stones, and also wood-type ones ... As for whether it's for him to comprehend wood sword force or to save people, it's hard to say. It's clear that saving people will consume energy, and it's inevitable that he'll demand an exorbitant price ..."
         "Can we use Hong Yitang to persuade Li Hao?" Huang Yu asked in a low voice.
         "Hong Yitang?"
         Kong Jie's head hurt, director Zhao also said slowly,""Since Hong Yitang has spoken, his demands are even higher. Li Hao only wants some resources, while Hong Yitang wants independence. Are you going to give him independence in Silver Moon? If you do, you can go to him. "
         “……”
         This was no longer a matter of resources!
         "Then ..."
         Kong Jie interrupted,"stop saying that. Other than Yuan Shuo, who do you think can persuade him? If we delay any longer, the Sword of Light will really die. What we need to consider now is whether the Sword of Light is worth the price. If it's worth it, then do it. If it's not, then give up!"
         Was it worth paying such a huge price for a single light sword?
         Director Zhao said softly,"if the light sword is willing to stay in Silver Moon ... Then it's worth it!" There weren't many martial masters like this. If he's not willing, then it's not worth it. If it's the southern Fist that's being tested, then it's not worth it. The southern Fist's character isn't good, and he's a liar ... What do you think about the light sword?"
         Kong Jie continued,'there's one more thing to consider. If a large number of experts really intercept them, will Li Hao be able to meet them?' If you see her, can you help her heal her? you should know that Li Hao can't save her in an instant. She might need a quiet place to hide. "
         Director Zhao let out a breath."Let's not consider this for now. If Li Hao dares to accept it, it means that he has the confidence or the spirit to take risks. We can give him the divine energy stones, but the origin divine weapon ... Is wood-type, how can we have so many wood-type weapons? ask him if he's willing. If he's willing, then we'll go. If he's not willing ... Then forget it. The light sword is on its own!"
          Three swords!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Kong Jie nodded and didn't say anything else. She continued to contact Li Hao through Black Phoenix.
         ……
         "Three?"
         Li Hao was a little speechless. He was indeed rich. Three wood-elemental swords, and he gave them away without any bargaining. More importantly, he didn't even bargain with the divine power stones!
         30,000!
         Back in heaven battling city, Hao lianchuan had been grinning from ear to ear when he had obtained dozens of divine power stones."Minister Hao, how pitiful are you to be smiling like this because of a few dozen divine power stones?"
         Listen to this!
         In order to save the radiant sword, Silver Moon was willing to pay thirty thousand!
         Li Hao looked at Hao lianchuan, who was frantically absorbing energy. Seeing his pitiful look, Li Hao suddenly didn't want to give him a blow. After thinking carefully, he decided to say,""Hao bu, Silver Moon will offer three origin God weapons and 30000 divine power stones for me to Save the Light sword. What do you think?"
        
         "What?"
         Hao lianchuan immediately opened his eyes and looked at Li Hao.
         Li Hao repeated.
         Hao lianchuan's mouth was wide open. After a long time, he said dryly,""Are you kidding me? they don't have that many in stock. I believe it if they have 3000 in stock. After all, it's a Silver Moon. 30000 ..."
         "Forget it if you don't believe me," Li Hao laughed.
         Hao lianchuan wanted to say something but stopped. He suddenly closed his eyes and stopped thinking about it. He felt a little uncomfortable and bitter.
         He felt that it might be true.
         In comparison ... He was really pitiful.
         Were Silver Moon and the others that rich?
         30,000!
          What did that mean?
         He had never seen so many divine energy stones in his life.
         As for Li Hao, after talking to Hao lianchuan, he was also thinking about whether he should agree to it.
         He had just stated his conditions because he was thinking that Silver Moon might not agree to them.
         However, when they agreed ... Li Hao had a headache.
         It was very difficult to save people.
         The other party must have someone chasing after them.
         Moreover, he was definitely not weak.
         This was the first reason. Second, who knew where the light sword had gone to? could he find it?
         However, the wood-type origin weapon and the divine power Stone tempted Li Hao.
         Wasn't everything for the sake of making himself stronger?
         At the same time, I also fulfilled my promise to the light sword. If the other party were to die early, it would have nothing to do with me.
         Thinking of this, Li Hao didn't hold back. He directly sent a message to the communication device on the armor."Sure, I agree, but I'll pay half of the deposit first. If the task is completed, I'll pay the other half! If I don't get there by then and he's dead, the deposit won't be refunded!"
         "Li Hao, you're still a night patrolman ..."
         Li Hao said bluntly,"the Nightwatchers are responsible for protecting Silver Moon. I didn't charge them when I killed the Pirates. This is an additional task. Why wouldn't I charge them?"
         You still want to kidnap me with morals? what are you thinking?
         I don't even know where my moral bottom line is.
         Kong Jie choked and quickly said,""Alright! How are you going to get there ..."
         "Where is the other party? I can go there myself. Of course, it's best to give me the things first. I'm going back to white moon City now. You can send someone to deliver it to me. Give it to me halfway. It can save a little time."
         "The light sword is heading north from the East. We don't know exactly where it is. We can only roughly confirm that it will follow the East Sea and escape all the way to the North Sea ..."  "That's good!"
         "Ah?"
         "Just like this!"
         It was enough for Li Hao to know the general location. With his pair of eyes, he just had to look along the way. The place with the large orbs of light might be where the light sword was.
         However, his own strength was really insufficient.
         Li Hao was still a little afraid of Silver Moon.
         After some thought, he looked at the small tree not far away and suddenly said,""Senior tree, I'm going out now to take on a more dangerous mission, but I've gained a lot. I've got 30000 divine power stones! There are also three wood-type divine weapons!"
         "You want me to go with you?"
         Li Hao nodded, that's a thought! If senior is worried, you can seal this place first and come out with me. After you get the item, you can recover a part of your strength, right? I think senior has consumed too much energy and can't maintain it, so he can only use the power of suguang. If we can get more treasures to recover our energy, we might be able to use even more power. "
         Li Hao set his eyes on little tree.
         The sapling pondered for a moment and shook its body.""No, I can't go out now! The palace needs to be guarded, and ... The outside world may not be friendly to us ..."
         Seeing this, Li Hao didn't insist.
         As he was thinking, little tree suddenly sent out a mental wave,""You're willing to pay me a portion of the reward?"
         "Of course!"
         Little tree seemed to be struggling. After a long time, he said with difficulty,""I can't go out with you, but ... But I can cut a part of my Origin Energy for you ... But, you must pay for my loss after you get the thing!"
         Li Hao was stunned. Cut off Origin Energy?
         "With the origin Energy I've cut off for you, you can comprehend the origin Energy once or use it as a one-time use talisman. It's stronger than my full-powered attack. At least ... There's still hope of killing you ..."
         In other words, he could either comprehend it himself or kill a mid-stage rising light realm cultivator?
         "Is there any loss to you?"
          "Naturally!"
         "To us, the origin Energy is extremely precious. However, I can't make ends meet and need energy. Otherwise, no matter how much trash there is, I won't be able to cut the origin Energy."
         Little tree was helpless. He had no choice.
         Li Hao's eyes flickered."That's fine. I'm willing to pay 10000 divine power stones and an origin god weapon. This is the price." When I come back, if I still can't comprehend the wood sword force ... I'll give the rest to you, senior, and then you can comprehend the origin Energy. "
         The small tree must have made a false report. One enlightenment would not require that much.
         However, Li Hao was willing to pay the price.
         In any case, it was all for nothing.
         Little tree was also very happy to see this. A moment later, a crystal-like root fell into Li Hao's hand, but its aura was not obvious.
         "This is it. When you want to use it, if you want to comprehend it yourself, then fuse your Dao into it and activate it. If you're dealing with an enemy, just use your mental energy to activate it ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao looked at the small tree. The small tree was even more dispirited.
