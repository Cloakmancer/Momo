Chapter 3821 The Chaos Catastrophe_ 1
The battle instantly erupted.The experts on the Lord of calamity's side also attacked instantly.As Li Hao chose Tian Fang, a battle was unavoidable. Countless lightning bolts appeared.The heavens fell and the earth cracked!The Tribulation's face turned ugly. He no longer cared about anything else. At this moment, he rushed straight toward Tian Fang. Several ninth rank venerable sovereigns followed him and attacked Tian Fang one after another. The void was shattered immediately!Escape into the void?Delusional! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  With a wave of his hand, Tian Fang sliced through space and shattered the heavens and earth. At this moment, he no longer hid himself.At this moment, the number one expert in the chaos was displaying his true power.Space reversal!In an instant, several rank-9s were separated.The life and death Emperor, who had been following the Tribulation, suddenly saw a blur. Just as he was about to break out of his small space, his face suddenly changed!It was only for an instant!All of a sudden, an extremely huge millstone appeared in the sky above their heads!The life and death millstone!Tian Fang's cold voice rang in his ears,""You don't have a single bit of brain. Can calamity be more reliable than me? At this level of cultivation, you've cultivated for nothing in the two extremes of life and death!"Venerable Emperor of life and death's expression changed. He could not believe it. "Impossible! The Dao of life and death, all spirituality belongs to me!"Why can you control life and death?Yes, life and death!Tian Fang's attack was not the power of space, but the Dao of life and death."Why can Fang ping Gather Darkness?"Tian Fang's voice rang out with a hint of contempt. There's too much you don't know.There's a lot you don't understand!Do you think that you'll know everything once you've reached the ninth step?This was fate!Being able to reach level nine back then did not mean that you were very talented. In terms of talent, many people in this era were more talented than those in the past, such as Li Hao, Su Yu, human King, huntian, Chunqiu, and even ... Reincarnation!Which one of these people was lacking in talent?Why was huntian the only one who had just stepped into Grade 9?If it was a million years ago, these people would have easily reached tier 9. Do you think that you're a powerhouse just because you control life and death?You can't even compare to reincarnation!Reincarnation, in any case, truly controlled the will of life, death, and reincarnation. It was the will, and not the Dao!Unfortunately, he was eventually killed by Li Hao.In an instant, the life and death millstone above his head pressed down. The expression of the life and death Emperor changed. The life and death Samsara wheel also appeared above his head. However, with just one contact, the millstone was shattered with a BOOM!Venerable Emperor of life and death could not believe it!Impossible, I'm the Dao master who controls life and death."You're only a Dao master, not ... A Spirit Master or a Divine Master!" Tian Fang's voice rang out once more. At this moment, the life and death path master seemed to be all alone in this world. For a moment, he was in a daze. 'I'm just a path master, not ... The spirit Lord!'He seemed to have thought of something. He seemed to have sensed something. He looked at the huge millstone. The millstone of life and death was very similar to his, but it was also somewhat different.What was the difference?Why had his Dao disc been instantly shattered by him?'Even if Tian Fang is stronger than me, I'm not his only opponent. Why ... Is this happening?'He looked at the huge millstone above his head. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and roared,""I'd like to see how different your life and death are from mine!"In an instant, his spirituality was completely ignited, and his power of life and death instantly burst forth to the extreme!So what if he died in battle?"It's just that I want to ... Know more. I want to see what true life and death are. I want to see what Tian Fang's life and death are.Why can't I defeat him?"I'm the life-and-death path master. Li Hao and the others only killed the tier 9 cultivators with other means, not their most powerful Dao. I don't believe that there's anyone in this world who has a Dao stronger than my life-and-death path!A moment of beauty!Life and death were burning, and so was the great Dao. He charged straight for the millstone, burning himself. With some madness and some unwillingness, he instantly merged into Tian Fang's life and death millstone.However, in the instant that he merged with it ... He seemed to have understood something.Suddenly, he mumbled,"I see ... I see ... The great Dao is also divided into two poles ... I see ... I should have guessed it long ago. Silver Moon ... Is your experimental field?" Or ... You and Zhan have always been in cahoots ..."Tian Fang didn't give him an answer.At this moment, the millstone turned and laughed,""In fact, you might not lose even if you become stronger after mastering the Dao of life and death. Unfortunately ... Your life and death are too weak!"BOOM!With a loud bang, the power of life and death dissipated and was instantly absorbed by the millstone. The huge millstone seemed to be even brighter."Life and death ..."Tian Fang mumbled and smiled.The life and death path master had fallen.This was also the first grade 9 expert he had killed.‚Äã ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the outside world.The Tribulation only dazzled their eyes. They tried their best to break through the spatial barrier, but the next moment, just as they appeared, they were suddenly stunned.The six experts had joined forces to attack, but in just a moment ... The aura of life and death had disappeared.They looked over and were stunned.Life and death ... He was dead!The most powerful person in the life and death Dao had actually died in an instant.This was not a one-on-one fight!The path master of life and death was not considered weak even among rank nines. At that moment, everyone had attacked together, but in the end, he had only been separated by the tianfang space for an instant before he had died.The expressions of the other grade-9 experts changed."As expected ..." The Tribulation murmured."You cultivated life and death for this day. Life and death messenger, yin and yang Messenger, five elements Messenger ... If these people don't die, I'm afraid they will all be killed by you!"

Chapter 3822 The Chaos Catastrophe_ 2
He gritted his teeth, as if he had completely understood.Tian Fang! He had been thinking about this for a long time, but he still had a little doubt. They both controlled life and death, but could Tian Fang be so much stronger than the life and death path master?In just an instant, life and death had been decided by him!If that was the case, who would be able to match Tian Fang?I can 't, no one can.Not even Li Hao's group!At this moment, be it the human King or the other powerhouses, all of their expressions changed. Even Emperor Yu, who had killed huntian, had a grave expression on his face.They had also killed a level 9!However, it wasn't so easy. It wasn't a one-on-one battle, but a one-on-six battle. In just an instant, he had been killed. Such strength ... Far surpassed theirs. As for the two level 9s that Li Hao had just killed, although he was strong, he hadn't been so relaxed.It was gone in the blink of an eye!The path master of life and death was definitely not considered weak among all rank nines. Even if he was not at his peak, Tian Fang was not either. Why ... Could he kill him so easily?In fact, there wasn't even any movement!The small space cut and separated, and in an instant, he was gone!"Connect with my daosource!" Venerable Lord calamity shouted.The others were trembling in fear. They had no choice. In an instant, their spirituality burst out, and the power of their great DAOs connected with the Tribulation."Tribulation of life!" The Tribulation roared."Demon Slayer!"Countless Thunderbolts appeared in the sky. In an instant, the Thunderbolts were everywhere. Not only that, but they were also mixed with the power of other great DAOs. They surged wildly and charged straight at the sky!The current calamity seemed to have returned to its peak.The powerful tribulation lightning energy instantly filled the world, and countless unique ripples spread out in all directions. The entire eastern edge had become a domain of lightning.Pillars of lightning appeared and covered Tian Fang.Tian Fang sighed softly,'you already had such thoughts a long time ago. Your lightning territory formation is targeted at me, right? You've been surrounding Tian Fang, saying that you're guarding the gate for us. What a pity ... Calamity, your ambition is not small. "The Tribulation was cold and silent.The lightning pillars seemed to draw in even more power of the great Dao. The entire chaos great Dao was shaking violently as if it was standing in the middle. A large amount of chaos power surged out and turned into the power of tribulation.Boom! Boom! Boom!The space was completely shattered, and the endless power of the Tribulation appeared. The sky that divided the heaven and earth was instantly shattered.The Lord of tribulation didn't say anything. The entire lightning pillar instantly turned into countless giant axes and hacked toward the sky!The six Dao Masters had besieged Tian Fang and died in battle. At this moment, the combined power of five Dao Masters was barely enough to trap Tian Fang.The Tribulation turned to look in another direction. Other than the six of them, there were still 11 rank-nine path Masters still alive.He had gone to deal with Silvermoon's forces.He wanted to see if he could send more people to gather the power of a great Dao and kill Tian Fang. He instantly frowned.The human King, little human King, Su Yu, and Yuan Shuo all had the power to fight against a ninth-rank expert. The experts of the myriad world and neo martial artists, who were inferior to them, could also fight against a ninth-rank expert.Su Yu and the human King were not enough.He had killed a Grade 9 before.Out of the 11 ninth-rank powerhouses, eight of them were dealing with them, while the remaining three were gathering their strength in fear, because ... Li Hao was here!Li Hao had come through space. Once he arrived, it would be impossible to send any reinforcements.The Tribulation's expression changed slightly.Damn it!Did this group of people know about Tian Fang's troubles?Even if you didn't know before, Tian Fang killed life and death in an instant, are you still not aware?He shouted again,"Li Hao, Tian Fang can kill in an instant. Do I need to repeat how strong he is?" If this continues, the five of us won't be able to stop him and will be killed by him! My lightning tribulation won't be able to hold on for long ... Do you really have to be so stubborn?"  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  At this moment, Li Hao looked over and smiled.""Tribulation ... Stop it. Just block them for a while. Wait until I kill them, then you can say that you can't do it. Do you want me to break it?""Foolish!" Tribulation coldly snorted.Li Hao chuckled."You're so hypocritical. Even I'm not as hypocritical as you!""You ..."Just as Jie Nan was about to curse, he suddenly frowned and shouted, "Don't relax. Continue to pour in the power of your great DAOs to suppress Tian Fang!""Everyone, this battle is a battle of life and death!" He roared. Since we have no way out, killing one person is one person. Even if we can't kill them, we can't let any of the new martial artist Silver moon's powerhouses Live!"Just as he finished speaking.In the distance.A loud sound rang out, and heaven and earth seemed to be swallowed by a black hole. Devour Dao master let out a fierce roar, and countless great DAOs were instantly devoured by him!At this moment, he roared and swallowed several powerhouses in one mouth!Those few people also roared.BOOM!The Golden heavenly Hound instantly exploded into pieces. However, it continued to roar madly. Its snow-white teeth were like sharp blades. In an instant, it left a bloody mark on devour path master's body!Several experts who also cultivated the devouring great Dao, regardless of whether they were from myriad worlds, neo martial artists, or even Silvermoon, were all sucked into the devouring great Dao at the same time!The devouring path master's face turned ferocious!A bunch of ants!Was it also to shake the heavens?I can't kill Li Hao and the others, but I can kill you all!That new martial heavenly Hound dared to reveal the Dao of devouring in front of me. He's courting death!Just as he was thinking, a book suddenly fell. From the book, figures instantly walked out. One by one, the neo martial artists walked out of the book and merged with all the neo martial artists in an instant.

Chapter 3823 The Chaos Catastrophe_ 3
The combat strength of all the neo martial artists soared instantly.As for the Supreme martial artist, his face was pale. He smiled and said,"my book of great Dao originates from everyone's Dao. Today ... Let's see if you can control it and kill him. Let's show everyone that I, neo martial, can kill a grade nine even without a human King!"One by one, the experts fused with the Dao of the Supreme martial artist, and their battle prowess soared. The Supreme martial artist took a deep breath, and in the next moment, a sword appeared in his hand!As soon as the sword was drawn, Su Yu, who was far away, instantly cast his gaze over."Eh? The sword of humanity!"Or rather, it was the emperor's sword!"Human Emperor!" He shouted in an instant.Suddenly, a powerful being stepped out from the infinite worlds. As though he knew what the other party was thinking, he wielded a huge seal and charged straight at the Supreme Being. The power of the people Dao gushed toward the Supreme Being!Li Hao's voice also came over.""Martial uncle Hong!""I know."Hong Yitang flew out from the crowd. The power of faith in humanity instantly burst forth, and a long sword went straight for the Supreme-being!The Grandmaster smiled."Many thanks!"The three of them were actually similar to the great Dao, which cultivated the Dao of all people. Of course, the human Emperor and Hong Yitang were more similar, and they all had a kind of great Dao of responsibility.At this moment, one of them was holding the earthbound sword, and the other was holding the human Emperor's seal. The power of the Emperor path gushed out instantly.It was heading straight for the Paragon!The Paragon held a long sword in his hand, and the Imperial aura burst out from the sword. In an instant, countless humans from the Silvermoon, neo martial, and myriad worlds seemed to be blessing and accumulating power at the same time."Three emperors of the human Dao, slay the demons here!" The Grandmaster roared.People Dao!A huge word appeared between the heaven and earth. It was so huge that it seemed to be able to suppress the heaven and earth. It instantly covered the devouring sovereign.The devouring monarch's face changed dramatically!People Dao!The great DAOs of the experts from the three sides had actually fused together and echoed at the same time. With the support of tens of thousands of people and billions of people, it seemed that in just an instant, all the humans in the chaos were united against a common enemy!In an instant, the faith of countless humans merged into one.The emperor's sword fell instantly."You can't defeat my Dao of devouring even if you have billions of lives!" The Dao master of the devouring path roared.BOOM!The devouring power burst out. In an instant, everything was devoured. There was no sky, no moon, and no sun. The entire battlefield, that area, instantly turned into a land of endless darkness!Everything seemed to have disappeared.There was a moment of silence.Suddenly, a golden light pierced through the darkness!In just an instant, a loud boom resounded as the devouring path master appeared. A bloody gash appeared on his head as he was split open by the golden light. As for the Supreme-being, human Emperor, Hong Yitang, the merman, he was also covered in blood and was in a sorry state. "You're nothing much!"The Grandmaster laughed.BOOM!A loud sound erupted as the devour Dao master exploded. At this moment, an illusory figure appeared. It was a little scattered and carried a look of disbelief. After a long time, it muttered,"Might can't win over the hearts of the people?"The Three Sovereigns gathered the strength of the people and gathered the Dao of responsibility. However, three grade 8 experts had killed him.He had broken his devour great Dao!Was it wrong to gather mighty power in one body?No, it can't be wrong.'It's just that ... There are too many humans. The three of them colluded with the chaos humans and unleashed their most powerful sword strike. That's why I'm no match for them. It's not that I'm weak, it's just that ... I haven't recovered to my peak!'  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  The devouring path master's body exploded, and a wave of devouring power swept out in all directions.BOOM!The sound of explosions rang out continuously. The experts from the three sides were also sent flying. Some of them were directly torn apart, but at this moment, they could not care less. One by one, the experts unleashed their powers in a frenzy to resist the explosion of the devouring power. They protected the three experts who had killed the devouring path master in the middle.After killing the Dao Lord, they were all extremely weak. It was very likely that they would be killed by the shockwaves!"Devour ..."Someone cried out in shock. Devour had actually died at the hands of a group of trash! After huntian, five elements, yin and yang, life and death, and Hurricane, another top-notch Dao master had died in battle.Today, nine powerhouses of the ninth step had fallen!This time, they were not killed by Li Hao's group, but by this group of nobodies.He couldn't believe it!In the crowd, the light and dark path master, who had been fighting the little human King, seemed to be thinking about something. Finally, he sighed and looked at the crowd in the distance.He laughed at himself.In an instant, the expression of the light Thearch changed drastically. Kong Ji's expression changed as well. The few light and darkness path cultivators from the myriad worlds, including Silvermoon's light sword, all changed their expressions!At that moment, they felt as if the Dao of light and darkness between heaven and earth had been extinguished.Seeing this, the little human King's expression changed slightly and he threw a punch at him!The powerful force caused the entire void to be shattered by the power of darkness.However, the light and darkness Emperor did not seem to mind. He looked at him and smiled."Dark power? The master of the dark path fought with me in the past and was defeated by me. What are you?""He's just the dark side of the human King. Does he really think he's a Big Shot?"The next moment, he suddenly laughed out loud."You're not good enough. If you want to be a Big Shot, I'll fulfill your wish!"In an instant, light and darkness appeared!In the surroundings, the expressions of the radiance Thearch and the others changed. Suddenly, with a loud bang, all the light power in the radiance Thearch's body exploded in an instant. He was speechless, unwilling, and helpless as he cursed,"What the f * ck ... I'm just a passerby, I didn't even have the time to show off for a few days ... What are you doing with me?"

He turned his head and looked at the empty space in the distance. He laughed bitterly."Son ..."Kong Ji's body trembled violently. In an instant, the power of light and darkness dissipated. The next moment, his life seemed to have been extinguished. However, very quickly, his life began to recover. At this moment, he opened his eyes and saw the crumbling light Emperor in the distance. His expression changed greatly!"It's okay ... Your father ... Is still old!"He said.The light Thearch smiled bitterly. With a boom, his body exploded. He looked at the light and darkness Thearch in the distance helplessly."What are you doing?"However, the light and dark Emperor laughed and did not care about their lives!They were just a bunch of trash!In an instant, countless light and darkness forces gathered in his body. Light appeared instantly, and an explosive sound reverberated through the world!  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  The surrounding experts were all blasted away.The little human King's body was also cracked by the explosion, and his dark energy was rapidly flowing out. He couldn't help but curse.I've always blown people up, but I was blown up today!Just as he was thinking about it, an extremely dark power entered his body. The light and darkness Overlord's voice seemed to ring in his ears and mind,""Have some fun with the human King. You are Fang Wushuang. No one will say that the dark can not defeat the light!"BOOM!The sound of an explosion rang out. In that instant, the little human King's eyes suddenly turned completely black. Not far away, the human King did not notice anything at first. When he felt the light energy exploding, the dark energy completely disappeared.In an instant, an extremely pure dark power was integrated into Fang Wushuang's body. He frowned and looked not far away!In an instant, Fang Wushuang appeared. His external injuries seemed to have recovered in an instant.At this moment, his eyes were like black holes as he looked at the human King. His tone was still calm,""I'm fine!"The human King frowned slightly and dodged the attack of a ninth-rank combatant. He looked at Fang Wushuang and cursed in a low voice,""D * MN, I've long felt that old Zhang's clone path was inappropriate. He has a split personality!"The light and darkness Emperor ... Was ruthless!At this moment, he self-destructed and used the power of light to kill a group of people. He then used the power of darkness to merge with Wushuang's body. This time, he was in trouble!The human King, who had always been optimistic, was frowning!Of the 11 Dao Masters who had surrounded them, two of them had died in an instant!At this moment, their combat strength was almost equal.Li Hao, the human King, the little human King, Su Yu, Yuan Shuo, and spring and autumn, who had just arrived, were facing nine type 9 powerhouses. In fact, they were no longer at a disadvantage.Although the Supreme martial artists had been crippled, dead, or collapsed, the death of the devour and light and dark rank nines had shocked the other party greatly!Li Hao had just arrived. He glanced at the little human King, then at the human King.The dark side of the human King had already gathered a large amount of dark power.At this moment, the light and darkness implanted all the dark power in his body into it. All of a sudden, it was a little out of balance. The biggest problem for the human King wasn't that the avatar was out of balance, but that ... He might have been able to merge with it at the beginning, but now ... It might not be the case!He might have directly broken the human King's greatest reliance and trump card!The human King looked at the little human King that was quickly gathering towards him and he grinned,""Son, are you alright?" "I'm fine!"Fang Wushuang replied.When the human King saw this, he laughed and scolded,"you ... I gave birth to you through hell and back. That's my own son. My son is the same as me. He's a little injured. Even if he's not, he'll have to complain. How can he be fine?"With just one sentence, he knew that he was in big trouble.He shook his head.He didn't even care about the others and instantly shouted,"Li Hao, you deal with those level 9S. I'll take care of my son ..."Li Hao smiled bitterly.However, the human King did not care about him!You can do it, cut the crap.I have to deal with my son properly. Otherwise, if I hope that my son is fine now, he might be screwed over later!He was also extremely decisive!He glanced at the neo martial experts in the distance. There were still some people alive. He shouted,""Fuse my body and gather the power of the Yang realm to suppress unparalleled. Chi, I can only force the yin and yang to merge now!"As for Fang Wushuang, he suddenly rushed at him, straight to the long saber in his hand. His eyes seemed a little dark. At this moment, he wanted to grab the long saber that was transformed from the big cat!The long blade was also made of darkness.If Fang Wushuang seized it, he would be able to increase its dark side. A cat's head appeared on the long saber and Fang Wushuang shouted in a low voice,""Big cat, come here, it's me!"The big cat seemed to be a little confused!This person was also Fang ping.For a moment, it seemed to be a little hesitant. It was all Fang Ping's fault. The one who had it was also Fang ping. Actually, this was also the case. However, at this moment, the two Fang pings seemed to have fallen out and were about to fight!What to do?In fact, in terms of attributes, the big cat was closer to Fang Wushuang at this moment. It felt like ... It had returned to its mother's arms.However, it was only for a moment ... Fang ping, who was holding the Changdao, slapped the cat's head.""What are you thinking about? kill this grandson! He's not a son anymore, he's a grandson!"Big cat came to a realization.'Oh, this is Fang ping. He can hit a cat's head so smoothly. No one else can do it except him.'At this moment, Fang ping had once again gathered the strength of everyone in neo martial yang realm.The big cat didn't need him to say anything. It meowed."Meow ... Little Fang ping, come back!"The meow of a cat seemed to have the power to shake the heavens.Fang Wushuang's expression changed slightly, and the dark energy in his body stirred. Fang ping snorted coldly,""The son still dares to disobey the old man. This is bad, unfilial son, he really wants to rebel! That little bit of dark energy from the light and dark factions is enough to make you waver? You're looking for a beating!"

Chapter 3825 Chaos Catastrophe (1)_5
Fang Wushuang saw that he was absorbing the power of the Yang realm again and suddenly retreated. He no longer wanted to seize the big cat blade.However, at this moment, Fang ping suddenly smiled brightly. He looked at the nine ninth-rank venerable sovereigns on the periphery as if his scheme had succeeded. Those nine people were actually still watching the show.To watch a good show of the human King!However, when someone saw the human King's smile ... He suddenly felt that something was wrong. His expression changed when he saw Fang Wushuang retreating in their direction. Not good, this was a conspiracy!As for the human King, he held a long blade in his hand and the Yang energy in his body instantly exploded to a peak. He shouted,""Son, don't run. I'm going to kill you ..."That voice was filled with powerlessness.Fang Wushuang didn't think of it at first. Suddenly, his expression changed as he thought of something. He shouted,""He played you ... He used you ..."BOOM!The nine experts attacked Fang Wushuang at the same time!One person, one move, directly split Fang Wushuang's body. The level 9 leader sneered,""You're still playing these little tricks at a time like this? human King, is there any meaning to this?"At a time like this!If you join hands, you won't be weaker than us.But you ... Still want to play tricks!They were indeed a group of Devils!Do you really think we'll be fooled?Let Fang Wushuang get close to us, and then ... You will join hands to kill us?What are you thinking!In your dreams!"Damn it, you guys saw through me!"The human King roared angrily and rushed towards the broken Fang Wushuang. He pouted and cursed,""Judge, you were raised by me, how can I lose to you? You must be joking!"This guy thinks highly of you even as a son, and you still dare to betray me!You're wavering just because of the light and darkness path master's dark force. How useless!  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  In an instant, the long black saber stabbed into Fang Wushuang's body!Fang ping sighed."The clone is useless. Big cat, it looks like I can only count on you. You'll have to work harder and swallow him. It's not time yet!"This was not the time to merge.Not to that extent.It wasn't that he didn't want to merge, but that merging at this moment ... Wasn't enough.Since his son was unreliable, he could only let the big cat continue to swallow him. The big cat opened its mouth wide and swallowed Fang Wushuang who had split open around it. It smacked its mouth and said unhappily,""It's me again!""Nonsense. My son was disobedient and I killed him. You're more obedient than my son. I trust you so much, but you're disobedient too? Aren't you touched?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhat was there to be touched about!Big cat was a little distressed, but he was not touched at all! He ate it every day. Dark energy was very unpalatable. Although it tasted good, but ... If he ate too much of it, he would feel nauseated.When the big cat swallowed Fang Wushuang, the rank-9s were slightly stunned and looked at Fang ping."Thank you!" The human King smiled.The expressions of the few people changed!Damn it!Did the dark side of the human King really fail?'This guy is good at acting ... Not bad. He's already at this stage, but he's always playing these little tricks. Yet, everyone took it seriously and helped him. Together, they suppressed the trouble that the light and dark Thearch had created with great difficulty!'The human King grinned and looked at Li Hao's group, puzzled.""Why aren't you making a move? We're watching a show!"All of them had just been watching the show, and no one actually made a move!Li Hao smiled."There are nine of them. You're not participating in the battle, and you killed your son. If they're not going to attack, why should we?" The human King was speechless!He couldn't help but curse,'don't ever cultivate a clone. It's too easy to lose control! The light and darkness Thearch has already rebelled after fusing a little dark energy ...""That little sister of yours has also turned into a freak. Why hasn't she betrayed us yet?" he looked at Su Yu."Don't worry, Daoist blue sky won't betray us,"Emperor Yu replied with a smile.In the distance, the laughter of hundreds of millions of Devils resounded at this moment. The weak voice of the blue sky came,""I wouldn't dare. My brother Yu has a different personality. Sometimes, he even wants to kill himself. If I betray him and kill another personality, what if a worse one appears?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEmperor Yu's face darkened as he looked into the distance."Shut up! So many people have died, but you're still alive!"LAN Tian laughed again."I have many clones. More than half of them are dead. There are still many more."Emperor Yu laughed in spite of himself and did not say anything else.Outside, the nine level nine venerable sovereigns just looked at them coldly without saying a word. They were in a dilemma!Many of the other party's people had died. The Supreme-beings and the others had once again integrated into the human King. The little human King had also been suppressed by them. However, they had also lost the light and darkness, devouring, and now, there were still nine venerable sovereigns.In the end, he only killed a bunch of small fries.The few big fish were still alive and well.The losses were too great!The few of them looked at each other. They couldn't continue to watch like this.As for the calamity, once Tian Fang defeated it ... They would be in trouble.At this point, everyone had no way out.The auras of the nine people rose again!Not far away, there was a sudden loud bang and countless lightning pillars shattered. The venerable sovereigns who were connected to the great Dao of tribulation suddenly spat out blood and their faces turned pale. Tian Fang, who was inside, instantly shattered the lightning realm!Countless Thunder shadows were destroyed in an instant!"Die!" Tribulation roared as he absorbed the power of countless great DAOs. The master of tianfang also appeared in space. Life and death appeared between heaven and earth at that moment. The millstone suppressed one person with a loud bang!

Chapter 3826 The Chaos Catastrophe (1)_6
The man was crushed into pieces!Tian Fang Imperial Emperor gasped for breath and took a few steps back. Tribulation Imperial Emperor let out a silent roar as he merged the power of the great Dao of the dead man into one. He roared and punched at Tian Fang, causing the surrounding space to explode!Venerable sovereign calamity's face turned pale. He looked at the three people who were still alive and sighed,""The lightning territory ... Has been broken!"The three of them looked dejected and desperate.Not long after the six of them were suppressed, two of them were killed. The other side did not have any intention of providing support, nor could they do so. The death of the devour and light and dark only killed a little human King!As for the Supreme martial artists, they didn't even put them in their eyes. It didn't matter if they had one or not!As for them, they were no longer able to suppress the other party. They would only die completely."A tribulation ..."Suddenly, one of them looked at the calamity with a complicated expression.""I know ... What you're planning!"Calamity's expression didn't change, but his eyes changed.But very quickly, that person laughed at himself."All these years, everyone has underestimated you. Of course, they didn't underestimate you. You were able to rise up near tianfang world, build a zone of calamity, and endure humiliation. Everyone says that you are the lowest among the level nine guys, but you ... After all, you have lived until today. In fact, everyone knows that you have means ..."At that time, the master of Tian Fang was extremely awe-inspiring!Who would dare to open a realm near tianfang world?Someone dared!Tribulation!Moreover, the order Dao wanted to spread the order Dao all over the chaos, but Tian Fang killed them all. However, the Dao of calamity had long spread all over the chaos, but it was not killed by Tian Fang.Was he more powerful than the master of order?Naturally not!It was because he could endure the Tribulation!Even though this fellow had reached level nine and was extremely powerful, he had been like a servant in front of the sky back then.If one were to make a comparison, this person was perhaps another new martial artist, King Huai!Being able to endure was the greatest advantage of the Tribulation.But today, he couldn't take it anymore. He had been provoking Tian Fang, creating cracks, and fighting against all sides ...At this moment, those who were familiar with him could actually see something.The level nine venerable sovereign in front of him was cultivating the way of lightning.He was the true master of the Dao of lightning!At this moment, he looked at the calamity and smiled.""We've known each other for so many years, so how could I not understand what you're planning? but I ... I can't stand Tian Fang's profoundness, and I can't stand the braggart of these juniors! I'm afraid that we won't be able to escape this calamity today. If you still have the means ... Kill them!"In an instant, the power of Thunder Dao rushed toward the venerable sovereign of calamity!Venerable sovereign calamity's expression changed slightly. Thunderbolt path master snorted and laughed,""I've fulfilled your wish, you've been eyeing me for a long time! I knew that your Primal Chaos lightning tribulation could easily kill a level eight, but what about a level nine? You lack the true essence of the Dao of lightning ... I ... Will fulfill your wish today!"The Tribulation's expression changed slightly!Not far away, the master of tianfang also sighed.""Since you know, you should understand that you are happier than me to face the difficulties you have faced today. Why ... Are you still doing this?"The path master of thunder sneered."The Tribulation is sinister and has been causing disasters all along, including today's disaster. However, the Tribulation is also resisting! Tian Fang, don't think that you have everything under your control! If it wasn't for your oppression, this wouldn't have happened. My Dao of lightning hates sinister tribulations, and I hate your seemingly bright heaven's will even more. I'd rather give it to a real villain than a hypocrite!"Venerable sovereign calamity suddenly smiled bitterly,""I ..."The Thunderbolt path master also smiled."You're the real villain. There's no need to say anything or explain. So many people have died today. Your dream has been fulfilled. In the countless years of chaos, there has never been such a Great Tribulation! Tribulation, if you can't win today, you're a good-for-nothing!"As soon as he finished speaking, his body exploded instantly. Countless Thunderbolts were all integrated into the Dao of tribulation!The other two venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed slightly and they sighed.Yes, they could all tell.He wasn't really an idiot! The Tribulation had actually been lying dormant all this while. It was waiting for everyone to fall, waiting for the greatest calamity of the chaos to appear!Where there was a catastrophe, there would be a calamity!No matter how many experts died, was it really that important to the Tribulation?No, it's not important!The more people who died, the better it was for him!The power of the Tribulation would be stronger!This also meant that the entire chaos had completely entered the moment of the catastrophe. This was also his strongest moment.They had all cultivated to tier 9, so how could they not understand the Tribulation's intentions? however, at this point, they didn't like Tian Fang. They didn't like Tian Fang's hypocrisy. They didn't like Tian Fang's calmness, as if everything was under his control.They would rather help this despicable man than hang around with that hypocrite, Tian Fang.They knew all too well how the order of the past had died!"I thought ..." Jie Nan smiled bitterly. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  The two of them also smiled bitterly,"what did you think?" The more the catastrophe shakes, the happier you are. Today, the catastrophe is coming, but you're working so hard to target Tian Fang. You don't even want to pretend to be a snake and join hands with Tian Fang. Your intention ... Can't we see it?""I know what you're thinking ... It's just that ... You didn't kill anyone yourself in the end ... So I didn't want to expose you!"One of them sighed."Thunder is gone. You've called us here. I'm afraid you've been waiting for us to die so that you can absorb our great Dao and perfect your Dao."‚Äã The two of them looked at each other, their faces filled with helplessness and dejection.The Tribulation still wanted to argue, but someone laughed and said,""Forget it. We didn't recover to our peak, our lifespans are running out, and our spirituality has been burned out. In fact, we already knew that today ... We probably wouldn't be able to survive. The prophecy and fate have long predicted this day ... We just kept it from you and Tian Fang. Did you think ... We really didn't guard against it?"The other person also laughed."My Dao of fate is illusory and ethereal. In fact, I can't see through anything for a long time. Together with your Dao of calamity, perhaps ... It will have some effect. However, calamity, listen to me. It's better not to believe in fate than to believe in fate!"As soon as he finished speaking, the power of the great path surged into the calamity's body, and an extremely weak voice rang in his ears.""Everyone chose you over Tian Fang ... Because ... Tian Fang ... Has greater ambitions! Be careful, he might ..."BOOM!His body exploded, and the path master of fate died.In the next moment, an even more special force appeared crazily. The venerable sovereign's expression became even more complicated."Qiankun, I ..."The last person was the heaven and earth path master. His smile softened. "Don't give me that. Be a real villain and don't be a hypocrite! "My Dao can turn the universe upside down and overturn the two poles ... These people are all cultivating the Dao of yin and yang, life and death, and other two poles. Tribulation ... I hope you can succeed!" Kill them and offer them as a sacrifice to us ... Our million years of waiting will not be in vain ..."As the heaven and earth path master spoke, another wave of great Dao power surged into the zone of calamity!The path master of calamity exhaled and looked at Tian Fang with mixed feelings.""So, they all know!"For the first time, Tian Fang's expression turned ugly.That was because he also felt that this group of people might not understand the calamity's intentions. Of course, he didn't say anything. It was only because ... He felt that the calamity's actions would actually be beneficial in eliminating this group of people!However, he did not expect that this group of people ... All knew about it!This time, he seemed to have lost control!The calamity path master's aura also grew rapidly. He was the only one left of the six experts on his side. Other than the power of life and death, the other venerable sovereigns 'great DAOs had almost all been devoured by him.Moreover, almost all of them fused on their own accord, and not much of them seeped out.In an instant, the calamity venerable sovereign seemed to have recovered to his peak state, or even exceeded it. Feeling the majestic power in his body, he let out a breath and laughed."Tian Fang, a hypocrite ... You're even worse than a real villain. Don't you think it's funny?"Tian Fang was indifferent!She only looked at him for a long time before saying indifferently,""Do you think that by fusing their great DAOs and perfecting your Dao of tribulation, you can stand shoulder to shoulder with me?"At this moment, more than half of the rank nine Dao Masters were gone.However, the power of the Tribulation was still growing crazily and spreading in all directions. The lightning in the sky seemed to have covered the entire chaos, and the power of the Tribulation was shaking the chaos!The Tribulation had descended!It was as if this was the true catastrophe of the chaos!

Lightning, fate, universe ...Many Dao Masters chose to use the power of their great DAOs to merge with the Tribulation.The catastrophe had descended! In fact, this group of people could see through the calamity's thoughts, and it wasn't difficult to guess what the calamity was thinking. Li Hao and Tian Fang had seen through it, but they thought that those guys might not have.The results proved that everyone knew what they were doing.This was what caused Tian Fang to be slightly moved.He didn't expect that everyone would still choose to support the calamity. Tian Fang frowned slightly but didn't say anything.Thinking about it carefully, perhaps ... There was a trace to follow.His goal was different from the calamity.Even if the Tribulation dominated the world, it was only a turbulence caused by the Tribulation. It was destined that chaotic times would exist forever. Chaotic times might not be a bad thing. To top experts, chaotic times were opportunities for heroes from all walks of life.As for Tian Fang, Li Hao, and the others, including chaos heaven and the master of order, they were all pursuing peace and freedom ...This was not a good thing.To powerhouses, a peaceful era meant that ... They didn't have many opportunities. They would have one more parent above them.On the contrary, chaotic times were the era for heroes to rise."Tribulation!""What?" Tian Fang's expression was indifferent."Do you think that you can contend with me like this?"The Lord of tribulation ignored him. The power of tribulation filled the area, filling heaven and earth. Countless cultivators and powerful experts could sense the destructive power of the Tribulation.The level 9s confronting Li Hao's group all had complicated looks in their eyes.The Tribulation had returned to its peak.They knew what the Tribulation was thinking, but they didn't expect that ... In the end, Qian Kun and the others would choose to support the Tribulation. The powerful cultivators felt the spirituality that was still flowing out of their bodies, felt the strength of their opponents, and felt their lifespans being consumed ...At this moment, they all had complicated expressions.We are at the ninth step.He was a figure who stood at the peak in the past.However, in that era, grade-9 ... Seemed to be nothing more than this. With tianfang and order, a group of grade-9 cultivators like them, in the era a million years ago, were actually ... Not too eye-catching.They were just the green leaves!It served as a foil to how powerful this group of people was.For example, in Li Hao's era, there were many experts. Now, huntian and long Zhan had died one after another. Perhaps only the human King and Su Yu could compete with Li Hao, but in fact ...In the eyes of a tier 9, if Li Hao had not given up on time, Su Yu would not have appeared at all. No human King could be as vicious, sinister, and vicious as Li Hao. This man had truly walked the path of the great Dao's emotionless Dao.The few great battles had all been started by this person.A thousand years later, a million years later, perhaps ... It would be the same as today. They would only know about Tian Fang and not the other tier 9 experts. When they were mentioned, they would only have heard of them. When Tian Fang was mentioned, everyone would know that the chaos was number one!At this moment, the level 9s ignored Li Hao's group and turned to look at the calamity.The aura of the Tribulation continued to rise!Tian Fang didn't interrupt the Tribulation. At this moment, he just watched silently. The Lord of the Tribulation looked at Tian Fang and frowned slightly."Brother tianfang is so confident!"He had absorbed the strength of many Grade 9s and at this moment, it had reached its peak.However, Tian Fang was still indifferent.It was as if everything was within his control!To the experts, this kind of Tian Fang was something that no one wanted to see. They were very unhappy. Everyone would rather watch the calamity carefully scheme. They would rather watch the calamity act a little stupid and think that he was smart. He was seen through by everyone, but they all had a tacit understanding.In their eyes, the Tribulation had no secrets.As for Tian Fang...He was always so mysterious.In fact, no one liked such a person. For example, when Li Hao was with the human King, people liked the human King more. Just like when Zhi Zun was with the human King, people liked the human King more.Even if the human King was not a good person.Even if the human king's mouth was extremely foul!However, the human King could often let you see what he wanted to do and what he wanted to do.Today's Tian Fang had also made them uncomfortable.I've always felt uncomfortable!This kind of discomfort had lasted for too many years.The Tribulation seemed to have been completely released because of the increase in his strength. At this moment, he looked at Tian Fang coldly and gritted his teeth, as if he was venting the anger in his heart."Tian Fang, you've always been like this. You've always felt that there's nothing you can't do!""You were like this a long time ago! It's as if everything is under your control, as if everyone is born to be your slaves. You're really disgusting and disgusting!"Tian Fang couldn't help but laugh."The Tribulation is not my fault. It's just that you ... Feel inferior!"He was like a young master from a big family. Even now, he still had an extraordinary bearing."All of you are inferior to me and have been suppressed by me for an entire era. You all feel inferior, but I comprehend the Dao faster, my strength is stronger, and my comprehension of the Dao is deeper. From the beginning to the end, my attitude towards you and others has always been the same. I have never looked down on you, and of course, I have never looked up to you. "He laughed. He didn't think there was anything wrong with it."If you want to say that it's inappropriate ... It's just that these people feel inferior. Whether I think highly of you or not is a matter of your own abilities, not my attitude. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  He looked at Li Hao in the distance and chuckled.""Li Hao is very young and not very strong. He's not as strong as you were back then, but I do like to talk to Li Hao. Since we're different people, and we can't get along well, why do you have to force your way into my circle and force me to accept you?"

He was so carefree, but it made everyone's hearts boil with anger!Not on the same level?Not in the same circle?We're both ninth-rank, how much more noble are you?Countless Thunderbolts exploded in the surroundings. The heaven and earth seemed to have been turned upside down. At this moment, the power of the countless tribulations actually ... Appeared like auspicious clouds. It was as if the heaven and earth had been turned upside down and time and space were in disorder!It was as if the catastrophe had turned into fortune and blessing.At this moment, Tian Fang became serious. He looked at the special power of the great Dao around him and nodded.""This is interesting!" Using the Dao of heaven and earth to reverse the power of heaven and earth, turning tribulations into blessings, that was interesting.There was a sense of two extremes!"Tribulation, do you want to spar with me?"As Tian Fang spoke, the Lord of calamity took a step forward and looked at him with cold eyes.""Tian Fang, don't be so insolent. I know I'm not your match, but today, I'd like to see how many trump cards you have and what makes you so arrogant! What was so scary about death? We've lived for so many years, and although we're afraid, it's not a loss for us to have reached this point!"It was human nature to fear death.Those who were not afraid of death were all lunatics and young people. The older they were, the more afraid they were of death.He had to admit that he was afraid of death.However, when there was no way out, there was no need to be afraid. He sneered,""Today, I'm going to tear apart your eternal and hypocritical smile!"He turned to look at Li Hao and the others and sneered,""Li Hao, I know you're full of schemes and tricks, but ... You have to see clearly that this old thing is not to be trifled with. If I die, I'd like to see how you can deal with him!"As soon as he finished speaking, he instantly disappeared!In an instant, auspicious clouds appeared between heaven and earth, filling the entire world. In an instant, his eyes turned into The Color of Lightning as if he had locked onto something. A green smoke appeared before his eyes!Fate!At this moment, the pillar of fate was like a giant pillar that reached the sky. It was so huge that Tian Fang had nowhere to hide.The eye of tribulation released a special fluctuation, and countless auspicious clouds seemed to turn into a human shape and charged toward the giant pillar. Pillars of lightning appeared in all directions and locked down the world!At this moment, a punch appeared. Life and death appeared, and the world was destroyed!Tian Fang was still smiling. His life-and-death fist seemed to penetrate through space and appeared in front of the Tribulation in an instant. Countless Thunderbolts exploded, destroying the space and breaking the life-and-death millstone. However, the Thunderbolts also dissipated instantly!The two shadows moved at a speed invisible to the naked eye, as if they didn't move at all. They crossed paths tens of thousands of times in the void!At this moment, the tianfang master seemed to have become serious. The power he erupted with wasn't much stronger than the Tribulation, but he could travel through space at will at an unbelievable speed. All kinds of space-sealing DAOs appeared, and countless Thunderbolts were locked in place by him! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the human King and the others looked on with strange expressions.He then looked at the unmoving tier 9 experts and suddenly sent a voice transmission,""Shall we watch the show first or what? There are quite a few tier 9 experts here. We might not lose, but it won't be that easy to win ...""If a Victor is decided between the two, it won't be good news for us either ..."Although they had killed many people today, they were not the main characters.He had always been Tian Fang!At this moment, it had become Tian Fang and calamity. They seemed to be just the appetizer of the great battle. They had an exhibition match first before the two main characters went on stage."Li Hao, you have a way to deal with Tian Fang?"At this moment, the human King glanced at Li Hao, as if he was confident that Tian Fang would not be defeated.In fact, he was also very confused.He had been watching Li Hao's rise all this time. Today, Li Hao was very strong, as if he had nurtured his flesh and blood in all parts of the world and chaos, making him stronger quickly.But ... Was this it? n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  If that was all ... The human King felt that he might not be inferior to Li Hao after merging with the darkness. However, this was not enough. Although they might have reached this point by then ... In fact, they might have been a little worse.If even the Tribulation was defeated, what could they rely on to turn the tables?Tian Fang wasn't a good person!This guy was just short of saying,"you all have to die. He wants to rebuild chaos and start over."Su Yu, on the other hand, stared at Li Hao for a while. He didn't say anything at the moment. He summoned the experts of the ten thousand races who had dispersed around him back, and a group of people gathered behind him again.At this moment, his aura was also becoming stronger. The power of order was transforming into the power of laws and fusing with the chaos. This was also his true step towards the chaos.However, he looked at Li Hao in confusion.To this time King, who had once been incomparably powerful in his eyes, now ... He was actually not much stronger than him. Although he felt that it was normal, to Li Hao, it had only been a few months.However, to Su Yu, the strongest and most invincible person he had ever seen was the time King.And now ... Although Li Hao was strong, he wasn't unparalleled in his beauty.Perhaps ... This was the helplessness of being strong.In the past, those who thought they were incomparably powerful had been surpassed one by one and had lost some respect. The master of time ... Was just a title given to Li Hao by the myriad races.

He was actually just a newcomer in the chaos.Su Yu thought to himself, still feeling a little regretful.To him ... He didn't actually wish for the time King he met to be so easily surpassed by him. That was the faith of all races and worlds, a symbol of invincibility!But in this chaos ... Faith was actually being shattered.Li Hao was still very strong, but he was far from what they had imagined. The cultivators behind them actually felt that their fantasies had been shattered. At this moment, if Li Hao were in Tian Fang's shoes, perhaps ... They would feel that he was an invincible expert who had created the infinite worlds.Even if Tian Fang was an enemy, it didn't matter.Yuan Shuo glanced at his disciple hesitantly and helplessly. Even though he had devoured the five elements Dao, it was still difficult for him to fight against a grade-9.The entire Silver Moon was unable to provide much support to Li Hao in this battle.Yuan Shuo actually wanted to say a few words, but he did not know where to start.At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be independent of the world. He didn't take the initiative to fight, but passively waited for the result. This was actually somewhat different from his impression of his disciple.Li Hao had always liked to control the overall situation.However, today ... Perhaps it was because of his strength, or perhaps it was because he did not have the confidence, he had been passively dealing with all of this. Perhaps it was because he had been integrated into the myriad world for too many years and had seen Emperor Yu's decisiveness and ruthlessness!Looking at his disciple today ... He wasn't even as proactive as the human King.Seeing the two of them engaged in a fierce battle, the power of their great DAOs fluctuating and sweeping across the entire heaven and earth, Yuan Shuo finally couldn't hold back.""Little Hao, you have a way, right? You must have expected this day to come ..."It was as if he was trying to turn the tables for his disciple, or to encourage himself, or to prove that his disciple was the strongest and the one with the deepest plans!At this moment, he was not willing to see his own disciple appear to be weak in the eyes of the other families.He wanted to prove that ... Li Hao had planned all of this!Li Hao turned around, glanced at his master, smiled, and shook his head.""They're too strong. We've only risen to power for a short period of time. Teacher ... Let's take a look first!"Yuan Shuo instantly frowned!She couldn't help but curse in a low voice, but she also felt that she was very useless. For a moment, her heart was filled with emotions.From the day he left Silver Moon ... No, from the day he dealt with the remaining experts of new martial, no one in the huge Silver Moon could truly understand Li Hao anymore. They were powerless to do anything.He looked sideways at the ten thousand races and then at neo martial.The new martial artists had all been merged with the human Kings. On the side of the myriad races, at this moment, the great Dao was connecting the Emperor universe world. They had a great relationship with these two kings. Many of them had died in this battle, but they had no regrets.As for Silvermoon, when she devoured the grade 9 world, a few Grade 7 and even grade 8 cultivators had appeared.However ... In this battle, they didn't give much support to Li Hao. Other than Hong Yitang giving the Supreme martial artist some power of faith and helping the Supreme martial artist kill a level nine, the Silver Moon cultivators ... Didn't achieve any great results.Even he ... Didn 't. However, he had actually obtained a lot. Everything, including the Dao of the five elements.At this time, they were surrounded by nine tier 9 experts. It seemed like they were powerless to do anything.His disciple's relationship with Silver Moon was not as close as he had imagined.The human King used his inner world to connect the entire neo martial arts.Emperor Yu had used his new world to contact the entire ten thousand races.As for Li Hao ... He was floating outside. His connection with Silver Moon had been completely cut off from the day he gave the position of master of Dao to Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang.He looked behind him from the corner of his eye and saw that the people from neo martial arts had disappeared. The people from the ten thousand races looked at Li Hao with complicated expressions. They looked at Emperor Yu with deep respect.Looking behind him, he saw that some of Silver moon's cultivators had died, while the survivors ... Were rather dejected. Even though Li Hao had killed two level 9s, it did not seem to have much to do with Silver Moon.They had nothing to do with it.At this moment, Kong Ji, the Thunder Emperor, and Dao Qi were all in a daze. The light Thearch was dead, and Kong Ji, who had always supported Li Hao, did not seem to see Li Hao. He only seemed to be a little dazed.Yuan Shuo didn't feel good.Ever since Li Hao had surpassed him, he had felt that the Hope and Glory of five birds sect were all on Li Hao, but ...At this moment, the tier 9 cultivators outside seemed to be in a daze, and just like Silvermoon, they all seemed to be ... Powerless.Then, he looked behind him and found that many people, including Qian Wuliang, were still alive. However, he didn't feel good about it."Qian Wuliang!"Qian Wuliang was a little dazed as he looked at Yuan Shuo and asked hesitantly,""Professor Yuan ..." He said."This battle is of great importance, and we can't just stand by and do nothing! Whether it's the new martial artists or the ten thousand clans, they're all just hired thugs. But now, I, Silver Moon ... Can't let go of them and can't do anything about it!"Qian Wuliang was silent.He had also reached level 8, but ...
