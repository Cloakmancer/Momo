"Should I ... Go out and meet her?"Shui Linglong added, but Paragon Sky Gold shook his head,"Since he's not willing to show himself, he must have some qualms. With the eight of us here, we're not weak even if we join forces. Perhaps he's worried ... Worried that we'll scheme against him. He'll only have enough confidence after he regains his combat strength!"As soon as he said that, everyone nodded slightly.That did make some sense!However, it was rare for a level nine venerable sovereign to be so timid.When he thought about how his main body had descended, he could understand. After all, if his main body died, he would really die. It would be fine if his clone was a little careless, but if his main body was careless and died, it would be a huge loss!……At the same time.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered madly.What was going on?He had only been testing the waters, but the five elements realm had suddenly exploded with an extremely dense power of the great Dao. It was not chaotic power, but extremely pure power of the great Dao, which they could absorb and absorb as they pleased!"This ..."Li Hao's mouth was wide open!F * ck!What did that mean?I was just testing you guys to see if you had any connections with the chaos path master ... And you ... Are giving me energy?Previously, he had only filled up 4500 worlds. Over the past few days, he had absorbed some and filled up dozens of worlds. It was not a lot.However, at this moment, the pure power of the great Dao overflowed.In the blink of an eye, it had filled up several worlds.Li Hao was extremely surprised!A lot of them!The five elements in the North had been here for a million years and had a deep foundation. At this moment, a large amount of great DAOs surged out. Li Hao didn't even care if it was a trap. F * ck, how could he not take this opportunity?The flying Tiger was also stunned, but it couldn't care about it anymore. This might be the most satisfying meal it had ever eaten in its life!The power of countless great DAOs emerged!It also devoured crazily and was so happy that it wanted to laugh wildly.This ... Was so unexpected.There was such a good thing?Li Hao was also quickly replenishing his realm. As the power of his great DAOs fused into his body, 4600 realm domains were gradually filled. He was only 400 realm domains away from the 5000 realm domains he had planned.The power of the great DAOs that the other party had prepared was extremely rich, and many, many!From the looks of it, he had also put in a lot of effort!Li Hao was extremely surprised, but he also confirmed something at this moment. His eyes flickered."They ... Must be involved with chaos. They might even treat me as chaos! Why would there be such a misunderstanding?"Or perhaps ... They didn't think it was a surprise that the chaos path master was here.In fact ... It should have appeared here in the first place?"What?" Li Hao did some mental calculations. Why was this happening? unless ... They were certain that the chaos path master would appear and had even received some news in advance. That was why they were so generous!He didn't even need to confirm their identities or worry that someone would impersonate them ... Li Hao had originally thought that he would have to confirm these people's identities.But now, he didn 't.They weren't sure, so they believed that he was the chaos path master!"Chaos ... Is really coming!"Li Hao suddenly understood.All of a sudden, some things that he couldn't figure out were instantly figured out. His expression changed slightly. The chaos Supreme Emperor had really descended into the chaos, which was why there were such misunderstandings.Was it like this?​ It definitely was!Those grade-9 experts might have come to an agreement to pay the price and let a true grade-9 expert descend!And this person ... Might be chaos.At this moment, some of his puzzlement turned into realization. So that's how it is. Li Hao laughed. His laughter was somewhat unrestrained. So that's how it is.Where was the real chaos now?He fell into deep thought.Perhaps ... It was also in the North?At this moment, countless thoughts appeared in his mind. Suddenly, he became bolder and the power of his great Dao fluctuated, mixed with chaotic fluctuations."Not enough!"……Five elements realm.The members of the sky Gold sect were still discussing when suddenly, heaven and earth seemed to fluctuate. A chaotic force instantly erupted."Not enough!"Supreme Emperor Sky Gold's expression turned ugly as he said in a low voice,""You have a big appetite!"He had already paid a lot!The five elements realm was indeed an Overlord. However, they also needed to cultivate. There were many experts under them who needed to cultivate. The great Dao crystals in their storage were burning madly to supply the other party.In the end ... It wasn't enough! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  How much do you want?However ... Since chaos was willing to communicate, did it mean that it had recovered a lot? was that why it was so confident?On the side, Jinyang said,""Fellow Daoists, do you have any more reserves? If there is ... Release more. We came in a hurry and were almost unprepared ... Since he still needs it ...""Burn more," Tian Jin said slowly after a moment of silence."A ninth-tier physical body is strong, and its Foundation is strong. It might really not be enough!"Even though he said that, he was still a little annoyed.Later, you better spit it all out with interest!The other venerable sovereigns beside him did not say anything. They continued to take out large amounts of great Dao crystals and burned them. After a moment of silence, venerable heavenly gold said,""Since he's willing to communicate, why don't we pay him a visit?"After all, he was a ninth-rank spiritual beast. Besides, he didn't even meet the other party face to face when he was selling a favor. He felt that he had made a loss!Just as he was thinking about this, another fluctuation rose,'I'll leave soon ... This time, my main target is huntian! Break the order first. The news might have already spread ... Be careful and be prepared to kill huntian!"

Chapter 3661 The Opportunity Has Come (1)_6
The few of them were moved!Huntian!This guy's first target was actually huntian.So that was how it was!However ... Huntian was quite strong. Wasn't it a little arrogant to set him as the first target?Even though you're a ninth-rank, you're only comparable to huntian in this era, right?They were still thinking when their spiritual fluctuations rose again."You just need to cooperate. You don't need to ask or care about anything! I'll create a clone to interfere with huntian's vision. You know what I'm doing. If I need your cooperation, I'll come to you!"Everyone's hearts stirred. Supreme Emperor Sky Gold followed the fluctuations and quickly replied,""We will carry out the venerable one's orders ... But ...""There's no need for anything else, just listen to my orders!"Alright!Supreme Emperor Sky Gold was a little unhappy. No matter how strong you are, you're still eating and drinking from us. Why are you so arrogant?"Besides, the world of five elements has been here for many years and is the Overlord of this place ... You came and started to mess around without even saying hello. If it weren't for the order of the Daoist master, we would have fallen out with you long ago!……At this moment, Li Hao was overjoyed to receive a response.As expected!My guess is true.Both sides did have some secret agreements and connections.What a coincidence!"Previously, I was just playing dumb ... I wanted to create a clone. If I were to encounter true chaos, these few fellows might not dare to ask too much. Even if two chaos appeared in the North at the same time ... They might not think too much about it.He hoped that he could hide it for a longer time.At that moment, he continued to absorb the power of the great DAOs. He couldn't help but sigh. An Overlord was an Overlord. Even if he was the weakest, he had a lot of reserves. In just a short while, the flying Tiger couldn't eat anymore.Li Hao, on the other hand, absorbed at least ten billion great Dao crystals at a crazy rate. The worlds were filled and perfected.It was close to 4700 worlds ...If not for the fact that he was worried that the other party would turn against him if he asked for more, he would have continued asking for more.However, Li Hao suppressed his greed.It was enough!I'm not a greedy person. Besides, if I asked for more, I wouldn't even be able to refuse if the other party insisted on meeting me. But once I meet him, perhaps ... I'll be exposed.The five elements would definitely have a chaotic understanding."Chaos is really coming. That means ... Huntian might really come ... If he comes, will the West be empty?"Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Or ... Lure huntian into clashing with the real chaos so that I can benefit from it?"If the two sides clash, the five elements realm and the rest of the five elements realm can all be mobilized. Perhaps ... We can take advantage of this and settle the five elements realm first! And then ... Go and get involved?"As these thoughts emerged in his mind, Li Hao's eyes grew brighter and brighter!This time, he had made the right choice. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Also, would the human King, long Zhan, and spring and autumn from the East participate in this?"Chaos, it's good to be chaotic!",m He suddenly looked to the West."Maybe I should go there and take a look. If huntian is here, he will probably arrive soon!"This time, they had finally met."A true level nine, an existence infinitely close to level nine, or even the reincarnation of level nine ... Order against chaos, that's more interesting!"Huntian had backup plans, but the North also had the help of chaos.Both sides definitely did not want other forces to get involved. Once a war broke out, it would be an all-out war that would end in an instant.This would prevent the others from having the time to participate.After thinking about it, he felt that there was not enough manpower. He thought of his teacher. He still had to keep an eye on him. Perhaps ... He could let his teacher do something. This Tomb Raider might not be good at other things, but he should be able to dig a few holes, right?It was best not to use time here. Otherwise, the experts would easily sense it.Digging a hole in the primordial chaos was a bit safer.It was a pity that he didn't bring the human King and revered sword along. If he had known that chaos was about to descend, he would have brought them along to dig more holes in the North. Perhaps ... He would have a greater chance. However, it was too late now.For this trip, he had also disconnected from time to prevent others from sensing it.Now that he knew Grade 9 had arrived, he wouldn't contact them.After absorbing all the energy in the outer area of the five elements realm, Li Hao left with the flying Tiger.…… At the northern border.At this moment, the chaos was still chasing after the other party. His brows were tightly furrowed. His luck wasn't too good. He seemed to have ... Recognized who the person in front of him was."It's him ..."Chaos frowned and looked coldly at the fleeing guy in front of him.It must be that guy!In that case ... He might have come from the West. All these years, he might have been in the West with huntian. Was huntian the reincarnation of order or had he just inherited the orthodoxy of order?In the past, in order to kill order, he had also put in a lot of effort.If he remembered correctly, the person in front of him was the leader of the ninefold guards.The so-called ninefold guards were actually a group of guys who did hard labor for order in the past. They transported the universe and created the ninefold heaven and earth. Order was a rank-nine Dao master. Although he was powerful, the chaos was too big, and he could not do everything by himself.He had a large number of experts under his command.He wanted to move the chaos and separate it to create a true Nine Heavens and earth. Each heaven was a world, and each heaven was a sky.The ninefold guards were all very powerful. If they weren 't, how could they forcefully teleport the various major worlds?In some worlds, it was even at level eight or nine ... The ninefold guards were all very powerful, but in the battle that year, most of the ninefold guards were killed, and only a few escaped.After a period of pursuit, some people had completely disappeared.Now, it seemed ... It was this group of people!They were at huntian."He must have recognized me!"'Damn it, my luck isn't too good. I've just arrived in the North and I've already encountered the ninefold guards. It seems like ... Huntian might have already sensed me.'It's ... The heavenly policy of order?He was slightly moved. Could it be that the heavenly policy of order had not been completely shattered?Observing the chaos!When he thought of this, his eyes suddenly lit up. In the past, when he killed order, he did not find the heavenly policy of order. Perhaps huntian had gotten it.If he could get his hands on the heavenly policy of order ... It would be even easier for him to Control Order."I haven't recovered to my peak ... It's not good to chase after me. Huntian will definitely know about my return ... I'll go gather all the level 9 generals and help me recover some battle strength ... Otherwise, I'll likely fall into a trap!"With this thought in mind, the chaos Thearch stopped pursuing him. He had yet to recover his peak combat strength. He was still in a very poor state. He had not recovered much during the journey."Let's go to the five elements realm first ..."He turned around and left.In front of him, the black Shadow's expression changed. He turned around and saw that chaos had left.He ... Might have recognized me!"But that's good. This time, I've confirmed that the chaos is really in the North.He quickly activated his Dao, and a moment later, he received a message. The chaos was in the North!……In the chaos.Huntian, who was still on his way, heaved a sigh of relief. This time, he was certain.That's good!Chaos ... I've come to find you!The hatred from back then, perhaps ... Will start with you.I could only hope that the other factions wouldn't discover anything for the time being, so as to avoid causing trouble and killing chaos. That way, I would have the capital to completely unify the chaos.Order ... Would be rebuilt!The nine Heavens and earth would be in chaos again. The heavenly policy of order would also become the appearance of the rules of heaven and earth. This chaos had been around for countless years. It was time to be unified!"When everyone only has one will ... My will will will replace chaos 'will. Even if heaven descends, I will have nothing to fear!"Huntian Supreme Emperor's eyes lit up.In the next moment, he pierced through the void and headed straight north.The huntian domain's expansion started from the North!By the time you realize it, the North will already be my territory.Li Hao, you're too naive to think that the five elements can stop me.If it wasn't for some apprehensions, Tian Fang's clone wouldn't have caused me much trouble last time. What's a mere clone to me?My true body is my goal!The opportunity had come!

Chapter 3662 Order (1)
A chance!Li Hao saw an opportunity.Would huntian come?They would! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Would huntian domain be empty?It was highly possible.Of course, stealing from huntian domain might be an opportunity, but ... Li Hao was still thinking. The situation had not reached that stage yet. Huntian and chaos were not completely entangled.The other party would also be on guard.He had a greater chance in the world of five elements.Where was the teacher?Can you find it?Naturally!He activated the five birds technique, and the origin fluctuated as he searched for Yuan Shuo. Whether it was huntian or chaos, they were all experts and would definitely have some precautions. Once someone joined the battle, they would benefit from it. These people might have considered it.Therefore, Li Hao had to make two preparations!Yes, he was prepared for both.It's either the five elements, chaos heaven, or ... They're all mine.And this would require the help of someone.The flying Tiger was definitely out of the question. This type of Beast of Chaos might be afraid of your strength now, but it didn't mean that it would listen to you. Once they separated, it was normal for the other party to run away immediately.Right now, there was still teacher in the northern region.Of course ... There would definitely be some danger, but ... How could there be no danger in the chaos? what was there to be afraid of?……The void fluctuated slightly.At the periphery of the elemental realm, Yuan Shuo, who was digging a hole, suddenly raised his eyebrows and looked into the distance.His expression was slightly strange.Five birds technique.Li Hao?Why did this grandson come here?Are you here to laugh at me?The point is, eight eighth-rank beasts, do you want me to take care of them immediately?I don't have that ability!Bastard, why did he come here? what was he doing?He cursed in his heart and thought for a moment. He also used the five birds technique.After a while.The void flickered.Li Hao appeared.A smile appeared on my face. I knew that teacher would definitely be nearby. As expected, I was right.After seeing what his teacher was doing, Li Hao smiled.""Dig a hole? "It doesn't require much technology, so it won't be very useful. Moreover, we were exposed in Tian Fang before. Although we've never been to the North ..."As he said this, Li Hao's sword aura suddenly appeared and slashed at Yuan Shuo!Yuan Shuo was stunned, and his expression changed slightly, but he did not move.This wasn't a fake Li Hao!There was no one other than his disciple who had cultivated the secret technique of five birds to such a level! In an instant, the sword fell.The shadow of a cicada seemed to appear on Yuan Shuo's body.In an instant, it shattered.Li Hao's expression was unsightly, and Yuan Shuo's hair fell off, but he didn't care. He frowned."Spring and autumn?"Li Hao nodded slightly.Spring and autumn!This person actually left a shadow on my master's body to monitor Yuan Shuo.How detestable!Li Hao frowned and looked to the South. Spring and autumn ... Was it in the South or the North?At this moment, Yuan Shuo was also extremely furious, gritting his teeth,""You bastard!"How hateful!Since when had he been targeted by Spring Autumn?But he didn't feel anything. At this moment, he suddenly felt a little dejected. I've been watched by someone, but I didn't even sense it. I have to rely on Li Hao to solve it. More importantly, I might have exposed Li Hao's existence.How hateful!Li Hao's eyes were cold. This plan is very important. Will spring and autumn ... Interfere with my plan?Spring Autumn Cicada!It wasn't easy for this cicada to get to where it was today. Li Hao admired and feared such an expert, but if he really disturbed him ... He didn't mind making the other party suffer.Withering and prospering?So what!Li Hao's eyes gradually returned to normal. He didn't say anything more and looked at his teacher. "It's fine, it's just a small problem. "Yuan Shuo exhaled,"I'm old and useless!" After entering the primordial chaos, I've become aware of the difference between myself and the experts. However...Fortunately, my mental fortitude has grown even stronger. I've been able to withstand even more power over the past few years, much less now. ""Teacher, after you destroy the world of five elements, no one will dare to look down on you anymore!"Li Hao smiled.Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes. 'I want to do that too. The point is ... If I had the ability, I would have done it long ago.'The key was that he didn 't!If I'm level Seven, he'll be level eight. If I'm level eight, he might be level nine ... I'm a step slower than him every ten thousand years, and I'm helpless.He was weaker than Li Hao every time, and he could only rely on Li Hao for a living. He was almost in despair."There's a chance this time. "p Li Hao said."Tell me," Yuan Shuo's eyes flickered."You and I, master and disciple, are of the same origin!"Li Hao laughed."This time, I'll have to choose one. Will I go to huntian or stay in the five elements?" There will definitely be a battle in the North ... Of course, no matter where we go, there will definitely be level 8 ones guarding the place!""There's a chance in the five elements realm ... I'll use my full body and chaos clone ..."Li Hao gave a simple explanation.His teacher would stay in the five elements realm while he would go to the huntian realm.If the war broke out, he would attack chaos heaven realm, teacher would attack five elements realm, or both would happen at the same time ... It would depend on chaos heaven and chaos 'reaction speed.Moreover, there was an advantage to having the same master and disciple.Li Hao said simply for a while and then continued,""You and I share the same origin. At the critical moment, if our identities are exposed and you impersonate me to lure one of us away ... It'll be very dangerous. The premise is that the two of us suddenly make peace at the critical moment and hammer the third party to death!"If that was the case ... Yuan Shuo, who was left behind to guard the five elements realm, would be in more danger. Of course, if he went to the huntian realm, he would be relatively safer ... Just a little.Li Hao continued,"I'll leave you an ethereal extent, but you can't send any messages. At critical moments, you can use it, but it will take a little time to use it. I'll teleport there, and it won't take too long. But for an expert ... This little time might be enough to kill teacher!"

Chapter 3663 Order (2)
Yuan Shuo's eyes flickered."You mean that I should stay in the five elements realm. When the war breaks out, I can enter the five elements realm as the chaos doppelganger and destroy their defense to take the five elements realm?" he asked."Right!"Li Hao said,"even if the eight level eights have left, there are still three more on the outside. Besides ... I don't think the eight level eights on the other side will all leave. There might even be an outsider holding the fort. As for teacher ...""Only Grade 7!"Li Hao sighed."If you had the power of the eighth step, I wouldn't be too worried. But the power of the seventh step ... It's very difficult."Yuan Shuo finally understood.This disciple had a huge appetite.He wanted to eat huntian and the five elements in one go, not just one side. If he only wanted to eat one side, he might not need his help.He ate both sides! This was what Li Hao was thinking.Li Hao continued."In fact, if I go back and call for help, I might still have time. It might not be so fast ... But ... If I call for everyone ..."Li Hao was silent for a moment."The credit belongs to someone else. Teacher, I can't be biased for you alone. After all, everyone is taking risks ... I know the situation when you entered Level 7! Therefore, I hope that you and I, master and disciple, can take him down by ourselves! Even if it's a little risky, I believe that teacher will not be afraid!"He was fearless!Yuan Shuo was fearless, but he was not worried about himself. He was worried that he was too weak to complete the mission Li Hao had given him, which would lead to Li Hao's defeat.This was the key.He fell into deep thought.I'll stay here alone and pretend to be my chaos clone ... The chances are slim, but there's still hope. Li Hao has already laid a Foundation here. Even if the other party suspects me, I can at least hide it for a while. At least ... I can give him a chance to enter the five elements realm.After entering ... The five elements realm was filled with five elements power.The next test was ... Whether he could seize the power of the five elements, strengthen himself, and turn the tables.Everyone cultivated the five elements!It didn't mean that his five elements were stronger. Even if his five elements had some intelligence, he was only at the seventh-rank while his opponent was at the eighth-rank. If he couldn't take control of the five elements, he would be dead.As for Li Hao's teleportation ... He might have missed the opportunity to seize the chaos heaven realm.It caused both sides to fail!Therefore, he might not use the ethereal extent that Li Hao had given him even if he had to activate it.At this moment, Yuan Shuo had countless thoughts in his mind.Would quick thinking work?He wasn't worried about Li Hao, but he was worried that he wouldn't be able to complete it. He simulated many situations in his mind. If he could enter the five elements realm as a chaos clone, the first thing he had to do was to seize control of the five elements power.A force God was comparable to a spirit!His control over the great Dao was very strong, but he himself wasn 't. His disciple could go back and ask for help. However, he had said that he only hoped that the two of them could complete their mission. Only then would he be qualified to share the fruits of the five elements realm's battle."I'm fine with it, but I have something I need your help with ..."Yuan Shuo said."Teacher, just say it!""Is your force God still there?""No," Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Yuan Shuo was speechless.艹!How come you're gone?"The killing tribulation can't be separated, we've all died together!"Alright!"You ..." Yuan Shuo was helpless."Otherwise, I would have been able to strengthen my spirit by lending it to you, and it would have been much easier for me to obtain the power of a great Dao. But ... I lost my disciple."What a trap!"Is the five elements divine text still there?""Yes, but they're not too strong. They're only at the sixth-rank, and when they're combined, they're only at the seventh-rank. Even if teacher fuses them, he won't become the eighth-rank. Even if he has two seventh-rank, teacher's power of great Dao is only one or two thousand, not as strong as the eighth-rank!"“……”I know!Yuan Shuo nodded."Then lend me this. Five divine runes. It shouldn't affect you much, right?""It's just five grade-6 divine runes. It doesn't matter. The power of the five elements isn't that strong."That's good."You said that you'll get the Chaos Beast to help me. Is that reliable?" Yuan Shuo continued."It might not be reliable ... But, there's still hope at the start. A seventh-tier Chaos Beast can at least help teacher defend once ...""Alright, then I'll take it first."At this point, he made another request,""The last request ..."Yuan Shuo took a deep breath and said,"if I don't let you come, you're not allowed to come!" Unless you're done, you're not allowed to come here! I'm not afraid of death, and you're not afraid of resurrecting one more person. If I'm really done for this time and can't be resurrected ... When you break through the chaos, come and resurrect me. I'll have a good sleep and not embarrass myself again!""Unless you've completed your goal. At that time, you have to come and help even without me telling you, understand?"Li Hao looked at him."I hope that you can make a name for yourself, teacher. I hope that you can regain your reputation. I don't want you to die.""You know nothing!""Don't you want your face anymore?"Yuan Shuo cursed. "Last time, you threatened the gold spirit Overlord and asked me to kill him. If you interfere again this time ... How embarrassing would that be?" You're all prepared. You're just one step away. If you can't get rid of them and seize the five elements realm ... You'll take revenge for me! It would be good to have a good name! To us martial masters, face is more important than the sky! I'm not that grandson Hong Yitang. I still want some face, but I'm only shameless to you ..."

Chapter 3664 Order (3)
As he spoke, he laughed to himself."It's nothing. That's all. If you agree, I'll cooperate with you. If you don't agree, you can go back and find someone to help you! Once or twice is fine, but I'll eat until I die. Your master, I also want face!""Teacher ... What face do you need?" Li Hao smiled.What face do you want!"Bah!"Yuan Shuo laughed and scolded,"I'm very famous, and I have a lot of face!" He should have his face! Let me ask you, can you do it?"Li Hao was silent."Then forget it, you go ahead and do your thing, I'll do my thing ..."Li Hao exhaled."Teacher," he said."You're not intentionally killing yourself, are you?""Nonsense, do you think I want to die?"Yuan Shuo was speechless,'do you think I'll intentionally kill myself so that you can take revenge? Come on! You bastard, I'll kill you or not, and you're already like this, so why do you want to die? If he could live, of course he had to live! Your master's wife is still so young. If I die, who will benefit from it?"“……”Li Hao couldn't help but cough.艹!Teacher, it's fine to talk about other things, but why bring this up?"What's wrong? are you envious?"Yuan Shuo chuckled.“……”Come on!Li Hao shrugged."When there are no women, teacher is very powerful, but now that he has one ... He's weak! "Look at teacher, and then look at the King of Man. He's also weak after he married. That's why ... With a woman, his progress is slow. Teacher, this is a bloody lesson!"Go to hell!Yuan Shuo was speechless.Where did this guy's nonsense come from?At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything more. Could it work?How many powerful warriors would be left in the world of five elements?A few level eight?A few Level Seven?Li Hao couldn't tell. Who knew?If the chaos didn't take all of them away, only a few ... Then there would be a lot of level eights left. Taking all of them away would be much safer. Teacher was only Level Seven, but the level Seven in the inner realm might not be able to snatch it from him.It was very dangerous, but if they succeeded ... When it came time to split the spoils, it would be just the two of them.At that time, his teacher had taken the world of five elements for himself, and no one dared to say anything.In fact, could he forcefully give it to the teacher?Naturally!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ However, Yuan Shuo's power of great DAOs that allowed him to reach Level Seven was distributed by Li Hao. If they were to give it to him ... The so-called fairness in the group would no longer be maintained. Then the others ... Would sooner or later be at odds with each other.At the very least, it was necessary to maintain some fairness within the team. So what if it was risky?Just as his teacher had said, if he really died, he could not be resurrected this time. Then ... He would wait for the day he broke the chaos great Dao.At the thought of this, he raised his brows slightly,'teacher, when necessary, fuse the chaos great Dao! If you're not afraid of death, then don't be afraid of being stuffed to death. It doesn't matter! If you fuse with the primal Chaos dark path, I can help you even if we're separated. You don't have to delay your own matters. ""Alright, I understand!" Yuan Shuo's eyes flickered.Then, the master and disciple discussed for a while.In addition, if chaos went to the five elements realm and the five-element overlords asked about his clone, it would be impossible for him to pretend to be chaos. Li Hao judged that they would not ask.After all ... Why are you asking so much about a ninth-rank?​ He wasn't their Dao master, but an outsider.If he didn't ask, the possibility of him sneaking in would be higher. If he asked, he might raise some vigilance. It was a double-edged sword. He had to deal with this depending on the situation."Then ... What about spring and autumn?" Yuan Shuo asked.Spring Autumn had been watching him, and he was probably hiding in the dark. He was afraid that Spring Autumn would do something."I don't care about her. If she meddles in this ... Teacher, you should admit defeat. If she meddles in my Affairs, I will settle the score with her! She's very strong ... So, her primary target might not be me, but ... Those two!"Yuan Shuo nodded. That was true."Where's that stupid Tiger?"he laughed."I'll create some chaotic aura for teacher ... That guy might not be able to recognize it in a short time ... Of course, even if he does, he might not dare to do anything. At most ... I'll let him go. By the way, he likes to study holy text. Teacher, you can make a holy text and play with it for a few days."“……”Yuan Shuo was speechless.Do you think I'm a kitten?This is a level Seven great demon. Do you really think a level Seven great demon is an idiot?"No need ... I know what to do. You're going to huntian realm now?""Hmm, things might change if we delay. Of course, before we leave ... It would be better if we could do something ..."Li Hao chuckled. After giving his master a few words of advice, he quickly left without delay.As for Yuan Shuo, he naturally went to look for the flying Tiger.As for whether the flying Tiger would recognize him ... Who cared!……Li Hao was extremely fast.He didn't go straight to the West.Instead, I took a detour in case I really met huntian on the way. That wouldn't be fun. I wanted to watch the Tigers fight, not become one of them."Chaos heaven, order ..."Perhaps, if he went to the West, he would be able to sense order, and the core of his 5000th world was order.He had wanted to take a look before, but he also wanted to get enough energy in the elemental realm to fill up the 5000 realms. Now, he might be able to get more."Huntian is quite cautious. He might have left behind many experts to guard huntian region. There might even be ... More than five thousand traces!"

Chapter 3665 Order (3)
"But in order to kill chaos, he can't possibly leave too many trump cards ..."The key was how to blend into the huntian region without being discovered.A guy who cultivated the path of order and even the huntian realm had merged into one and become the territory of his will. Once an outsider barged in, they would be out of place and would be easily discovered."Order ..."As he flew, Li Hao pondered about the way of order. Order was also a rule, but it was not all rules.Huntian himself wasn't here, so this was his chance.If they were, it would be hard to enter the chaos heaven domain without being discovered.Everything would be revealed when the time came.The West was also the most mysterious and heavily guarded place. Huntian advanced step by step. His rule was not like the scattered rule of the other sides. Instead, it was like a dynasty. He had truly unified the territory!……While Li Hao was heading to the huntian realm.Five elements realm.The chaos had arrived. Feeling the density of the great Dao in the five elements realm, he pouted slightly and felt that it was a little weak.It seemed to consume a lot of energy!I wanted to absorb some great Dao power here to recover, but I don't know if it was used up earlier, or if it knew I was here and was pretending to be poor?He wasn't as cautious as Li Hao and still needed to probe.He was aware of the situation, so he naturally didn't need to probe.He directly forced his way into the five elements realm.In just an instant, the eight grade eight experts in the realm all sensed it and were a little surprised ... They had just left and they had already returned?It was quite fast!Looking at the situation ... Were they going to meet this time?The few of them did not dare to hesitate and quickly rose into the air.​ Near the realm gate.The eight grade eight experts quickly appeared. In an instant, a chaotic energy appeared and one person appeared. His face was a little illusionary and the few of them quickly bowed,""I pay my respects to the Chaos Knight!""You got the news?" chaos nodded slightly.The few of them were puzzled. What news?"The five elements path master and the sky path master didn't say anything?" chaos raised his eyebrows slightly."Oh, oh ...""I've already said that I'll cooperate with the venerable one in everything!"Supreme Emperor Skygold hurriedly replied."Yes.""Yes." Chaos nodded slightly."The five elements realm has dominated the North for many years. How many great Dao crystals are there left to use?"“……”'Supreme Emperor Skygold, my teeth are aching. You've just absorbed a lot, and here you are again!'He was a little helpless and could only bite the bullet and say,""There's still some left, but not much. I've used up a lot of it, venerable one, you know ..."Chaos sneered, but didn't say anything.I know that you've consumed a lot of energy. You've been abused by others. You're injured quite badly.Are you telling me this because you're poor? "How many more?""There's still ... Just barely ten billion!"Chaos frowned slightly. It was less than expected, but ... It was barely enough."Alright, give it to me!"Supreme Emperor Sky Gold was helpless. What a ... Big appetite!He didn't say much, but the chaos Emperor continued,""I've found traces of the ninefold guards. Do you know about them?""I know ... I've heard a little about it.""That's good. This also means that ... Order is not far away!""Order! Chaos!" Chaos said in a deep voice. The two must be related. My identity has been exposed. This time, I must eliminate the roots! The number of people in the ninefold guards is unknown, their numbers are unknown, and their strength is unknown ... The other Dao Masters must have informed them of my arrival. They might be on their way here to gather them and kill huntian!""I'll stay in the five elements realm for the next few days. Help me do something ...""Venerable one's orders!"The few of them hurriedly said.Chaos was silent for a moment, then said,""Create chaos and make the North completely turbulent. The more chaotic it is, the stronger I will be. Of course, this is not good for the rule of the five elements, but once the North is broken through, a new order will be established, and everyone will die!""Covet a large number of great Dao crystals and the power of the world to help me recover my strength! I need dead people and spirituality. As you all know, the more people die, the more spirituality there will be. This will be beneficial for Dao Masters like you to descend!"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The five elements Overlord hesitated.Was the North going to be in complete chaos?Many years of rule ...But at this moment, he gritted his teeth and nodded.""Alright!"He still agreed.He wanted to ask where chaos 'clone had gone ... But after thinking about it, he decided against it. This level nine might not tell him, and it would be easy to offend him.If an eighth-ranked person were to question a ninth-ranked person, the other party would not be too happy.The grade 8 experts didn't say anything. Were they creating chaos?It was also simple!It was difficult to establish order, but it was much easier to create chaos. By killing more people and destroying more worlds, chaos would naturally ensue.Very quickly, the five elements realm was activated.As for the chaos Emperor, he was in charge of the five elements and began to absorb the power of the great DAOs to recover his strength. However, he was a little unhappy because it was much less than expected.Forget it!It was only slightly richer than a type 8 world!He had wasted his time!For so many years, they had been living like this. No wonder when Tian Fang and the others descended, everyone else participated and the North was almost forgotten.……As for Supreme Emperor Sky Gold and the others who had left, they were also cursing in their hearts.How greedy!He had devoured a lot of great Dao crystals before and was even going to take out all his assets now. In the end, the other party still looked dissatisfied. Tier 9, he was too greedy!No wonder the chaos could not tolerate a tier 9!These people had been staying in the chaos all this time. In a million years, the chaos would probably be completely emptied by them, and they would only enter but not leave.

Chapter 3666 Order (3)_5
……On the other side.Huntian Supreme Emperor appeared between heaven and earth, and soon, a black figure appeared with excitement."Dao Lord, I've confirmed it. It's the chaos main body! He's gone to the five elements realm. Recently, it seems that other experts have entered the northern region ... Perhaps it's the other type 9 subordinates. Chaos has also discovered me, so ... He might know that the Dao Lord is coming. "Huntian nodded slightly and looked in the direction of the five elements realm.So what if he knew!"I don't want too many people to know. Chaos is also a thought. The descent of a class 9 is something that everyone is very interested in."So, I won't say anything. I won't say anything about the chaos. That's a war between our two sides."Get ready, attack and chaos!"Huntian didn't say much. After waiting for a while, he said,""Get ready and wait for the others to gather! "This time, I'm going to take them all down. If they think that I'm the only one in the huntian realm, then they're wrong. Gather all the ninefold guards! The enmity of the past will start with him!""Understood. I'll gather them immediately ... Also ... Do we need to establish order first?" the black figure was extremely excited."No rush."Huntian revealed a smile.""Chaos will definitely create chaos first to strengthen himself. Order and chaos have always been opposing forces. However, he doesn't understand that building order in chaos ... Is the true order. There can be no establishment without destruction!" No destruction, no construction!The North was too decadent. Letting chaos break the decadent order here and building a new order himself would save him a lot of trouble.Only in this way could the strongest order be established!He would eradicate all the filth and trash!"It's not convenient for me to do it, but if chaos does it himself, it can save me a lot of trouble. As for increasing my strength ... So what?The current Hundun couldn't support a peak grade nine.At most, he would just recover a little more spirituality.……The North was starting to get a little turbulent.Meanwhile, the West was extremely quiet.It seemed to be incompatible with the chaos.The moment Li Hao stepped into the Western realm ... His heart froze.He had originally thought that the West was different from the other three, but not by much. However, at this moment, he instantly felt the difference.The entire West ... Seemed to have some light, and was not as dark as the other three chaotic regions.As for the West ... There were many people, so it didn't feel as bleak.The nine Heavens were clearly divided.Moreover, unlike the other regions, there seemed to be a barrier in the middle of each of the nine Heavens. It was not like other places, where it was only cut by the dense chaotic energy.It was a true stronghold!Lower three heavens, a low-level world.Middle three heavens, a medium-level world.High level world, upper three heavens. They were in good order!Not only was order established, but there was also an Army here. This was the first time Li Hao had seen an Army in the chaos, with uniform armor and equipment.Each layer of heaven had a large number of troops.To prevent people from smuggling!The entire West seemed to be ... Well planned.In the primal Chaos, it wasn't completely empty. There were many deserted islands. No, this place wasn't called a deserted island. It was ... A Primal Chaos relay station.There were also people gathered at these relay stations.It seemed to have become a place for discussions. Apart from being less convenient than Li Hao's heavenly Daoist Rite, it could be said that this was the prototype of the heavenly Daoist Rite. Unfortunately, the other party did not know Li Hao's tricks.Otherwise, huntian would probably have already built a similar heavenly Daoist Rite.At this moment, Li Hao ... Actually hesitated.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Yes, he hesitated."This place is actually very good. It's very orderly. I've always been a chivalrous swordsman. If this place is incomparably dark, I can naturally take over it and flaunt myself to save the people.However, this place ... Was peaceful and prosperous."What I need to do now is to enter the core of huntian, break this order, take huntian, and turn this place ... Into a land of chaos again.Li Hao stopped in his tracks.He had always been ruthless to his enemies.But today ... The moment he stepped into the realm, he actually hesitated. 'If I break the peace of the huntian realm today and cause this place to become turbulent and lose its homes, will I ... Still be the swordsman I proclaim?'For a moment, he was actually a little ... Hesitant."I want to become stronger. I want to split open the sky. I want to fulfill my dream ... Chaos heaven must be an obstacle. He wants to unify the world, and this unification includes us!Therefore, there was bound to be enmity between them.But ...Li Hao, who had always been decisive, was actually hesitating today after just one look. Should I continue?"To break the order of this place?"Li Hao fell into deep thought.He didn't say if he could, but if he wanted it.If huntian did not want to unify the world and only wanted to satisfy his position as the Overlord of the West, the West was actually very good and there was no reason to be his enemy. However, he wanted to unify the entire chaos ...It was also Li Hao's first time seeing order in the chaos!Perhaps, there were still some flaws and it was not perfect.However, it was beyond Li Hao's imagination.After struggling for a moment, Li Hao suddenly gritted his teeth.""I ... I can also establish such an order! Other people's order belongs to others, but what I've established ... Is my own order and rules!"I've said this before.On that day, he didn't know that the order in the West was already quite perfect. Today, he gained some enlightenment. But in the end, Li Hao gritted his teeth. The order at this moment was only a fleeting moment.

Chapter 3667 Order (1)_6
"Huntian is destined to have a hard time. He might have more enemies than I do. Anyone who doesn't submit is his enemy."I will build a more perfect order than his ... I will!"Li Hao consoled himself and gave himself an excuse.Otherwise ... He couldn't bear to break the West today.And such an orderly realm might be ... Suitable for splitting open the skies and making it a base for the pseudo-chaos. These people might be able to enter the pseudo-chaos, and perhaps ... Order would be better.Yes, that was it.In the end, he convinced himself that Li Hao, you must remember ... You will not submit to anyone. You broke the order here to establish a better order ...And chaos heaven's order was only his!He instantly merged into the West and headed straight for the ninth heaven without hesitation. He merged into the regional wall and concealed his aura as he headed towards the huntian realm.On this trip ... He had to kill less.This was perhaps the only thing he could do."Huntian ..."Li Hao muttered to himself,"there's no enmity between you and me. It's just a simple difference in ideology. It's not even a difference in ideology. It's just that ... Your unification and my freedom are in conflict."Li Hao stopped thinking about it.They continued forward.The entire Western Region was very peaceful, and there were relatively few Wars. However, there were still some, just that ... It was not as chaotic. The conquests between worlds still existed, but they were all present within a certain range.Huntian's Army seemed to be expanding. A large number of venerable sovereigns filled the Army, and huntian's strength was far stronger than what the outside world seemed to be.Including the number of experts under his command!……And at this moment.Within the huntian realm.The nine Heavens was the only world.A large number of cultivators were entering and leaving.In the hall of order.One by one, the experts observed the heavens.The entire Western Region was under their observation. They could see where the battle was going on and where the war was going on. The mirrors were displaying everything in the Western Region.Pengcheng was patrolling.As a level eight venerable sovereign, huntian had left without him. He didn't even know that huntian had gone out.As he walked past the hall of order, he could hear the voices of cultivators."Sixth heaven, region 37, war has broken out. Two tier 6 worlds are in conflict. Should the huntian guards intervene?""Conflict has broken out in the third heaven. Two third rank venerable sovereigns are fighting in the chaos ... Should we stop them?"“……”This was the core place that dealt with the problems in the entire Western Region. It was also the existence of this place that established the order in the West.Countless venerable sovereigns were working for huntian, building the embryonic form of the entire huntian dynasty.Not a dynasty, but a divine dynasty!An extremely powerful divine dynasty!Peng Cheng, who was at the eighth rank, was also one of the people in charge of this place. If there were disputes between the top powerhouses, he would also participate, either as the law enforcer or mediator. The outside world thought that there were only a few eighth level venerable sovereigns in the West, and only Pengcheng knew about them. It was far more than the outside world could imagine.Just the order Hall alone had four level 8 Masters!He was in charge of all the disputes under the 7th Heaven.Above the seventh layer of heaven, the disputes in the great world were not under the jurisdiction of this place, but under the jurisdiction of the ninefold guards ... It was a very mysterious place, and even Peng Cheng did not know much about it.That was also the core of the chaos heaven realm.At that moment, a voice rang in Pengcheng's ears,""Venerable sovereign Pengcheng! Come to the ninefold guards. "Pengcheng's heart stirred.He looked around and saw that the other level eight venerable sovereigns seemed to have received the news as well. Without further delay, he quickly flew higher into the sky. ……A moment later, several level eight venerable sovereigns arrived.In front of him was also a large hall, which was extremely ancient and simple.The door of the hall closed.At this moment, a cultivator was sitting cross-legged outside the door. When he saw them, he didn't waste any time and said directly,""The venerable sovereigns are all here. I'll make it short. The path master has something to do and has mobilized a large number of experts. The Western Region may be at its weakest moment. There are only six level eight experts in this world ... Including me!"Six, only.Venerable Pengcheng was actually very helpless.Currently, there weren't many grade-8 experts under the direct control of the overlords. The others were just in name and didn't really follow orders.However, the chaos heaven realm had recruited a large number of experts and six level 8 experts. That was a lot!He was familiar with the person in front of him and had seen him a few times.He was a very powerful one!He was the Vice commander of the ninefold guards. As for his official position ... He had always followed the path master, so he rarely saw him. When he did, he kept a low profile most of the time, so he had no idea how strong he was.He only knew that the person in front of him ... Was perhaps even stronger than him.He had 4000 great Dao and a chaotic beast body. His combat power was not weaker than some experts with 5000 great Dao, but he still felt some pressure in front of this person.In his opinion, this person's strength was not weaker than Samsara!The huntian realm was terrifyingly powerful. Therefore, he had never been optimistic about long Zhan. This was also a fact. There was no choice. The truth was just so cruel!Just as he was thinking, the old man in front of him said in a deep voice,""The path master has left. We have to protect the order that the path master has painstakingly built ... From today onwards, all tier 8 martial artists will have to work hard and guard the important points of the realm. Other than me, Paragon Pengcheng is the strongest here, and he's personally guarding the realm gate!""If Dao master succeeds this time and returns safely, the hope of my huntian realm ... Uniting the world will greatly increase!"Pengcheng accepted the order, but in his heart, he was thinking, where did the Dao master go?Could it be ... That he had gone to kill some Overlord?Otherwise, there was no need to mobilize so many powerhouses and even empty the ninefold guards so that they would have to call tier 8 experts like them to guard the realm.In the past, this was the duty of the ninefold guards."Then ... Who are we guarding against?"Peng Cheng asked,"the other overlords ... All have their own reports. Apart from the spring and autumn being a little unknown, the human King is subduing the East, the Silver Moon King is cultivating in seclusion, and the Dragon Lord is improving the defense of the four regions and reviving the Coiling Dragon ..."There's nothing to guard against, right?Of course, it was the same for the North, but the North ... He didn't care too much about it. Even he had underestimated the North.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The old man of the ninefold guards said in a low voice,"I don't know who to guard against, but we must guard against all enemies!" From today on, no high-level venerable sovereigns were allowed to enter the huntian realm except for the Dao master! If the six of us join forces and don't leave the realm, we can even resist an Overlord! Focus on monitoring the hall of order. In addition, even if there are wars between high-stage venerable sovereigns, stop mediation, just in case!"The venerable sovereigns didn't think much of it, but they still nodded after hearing what the old man said.Pengcheng also headed straight for the realm gate.After everyone had left, the old man let out a breath. He hoped that everything was fine. That was the best.If Dao master resolved the chaos this time and huntian directly invaded the North, it would be equivalent to half of the entire chaos falling into their hands. Dao master would become even more powerful. Unless a large number of level nine experts descended ... Otherwise, huntian would have no match!"I hope ... I can restore my former glory!"More than a million years ago, order was established, and chaos was divided into nine parts!At that time, order was like the sun in the sky.Even today's tianfang wasn't as famous as order. It had established the nine Heavens, and there were many Grade 9 worlds that bowed down to it ...At that time, it would be the peak of order!Chaos and order were about to be completely established, but ..."Tian Fang!"The old man muttered. That fellow was hateful!Today, it seemed harmless. In the past, the master of order's most fatal blow was the damage to space. If it wasn't for Tian Fang's Secret planning, order would not have been defeated.In the past, Dao master had trusted Tian Fang and the others too much. Today, he would definitely not repeat the same mistakes!He looked toward the outer realm with anticipation in his eyes.Order was about to return.[Author's note: take a day off tomorrow to relax. I've finished laying the groundwork for the prelude, but I'm in a bad state. I'll go straight to the yellow Dragon the day after tomorrow. I'm afraid that I won't be able to write the results I want if I'm in a bad state tomorrow. Although it's only the 2nd, I'll still double it. I'll stop for a day. I hope everyone can understand.]

Chapter 3668 Order And Chaos (1)
In the North.The order was in turmoil.The sounds of slaughter filled the world.The worlds began to break apart. Countless cultivators tried to escape if they could, but those who couldn't could only be destroyed along with the world.The will of chaos began to spread in the North.The North began to fall into chaos.……Five elements realm.The chaos Emperor was in a good mood as he absorbed the chaos intent.The turbulent world was the foundation of his survival. In fact, he did not want the chaos to calm down. It was best if it was as chaotic as ever. It was best if order was never established.Of course, if order could never be established, the spirituality of chaos might continue to weaken, and it might grow stronger in a short time ... But as people died and chaos continued, the spirituality would still weaken.Unless, the chaos could continue, but order could be established in the chaos.This might be the point of convergence between order and chaos.As a level nine venerable sovereign, he knew very well that Hundun would be unified sooner or later ... It might be Tian Fang or someone else, but from the looks of it, his chances were slim.And this time, he was able to arrive in advance ... Perhaps, this was the one in ten thousand chance, the only chance.Killing the successor or reincarnation of order and snatching the order heavenly policy might be his only chance to rise up and fight against Tian Fang and the others. Otherwise, he would not be able to fight against an existence like Tian Fang.He looked to the West ...Perhaps, they were coming.Perhaps, they were prepared to deal with him?He had just arrived and his strength had not recovered to its peak. Huntian might have thought that this was the best time to kill him."When Tian Fang and the others asked me to descend ... Did they consider this?"Have they ever thought that when I descend, I will be surrounded and killed by order?Tian Fang will definitely take this into consideration!"So, what is Tian Fang thinking? is he hoping that I kill huntian, or is he hoping that huntian will kill me and establish a stronger order?At this moment, he could no longer see through Tian Fang's thoughts.Ever since the death of order, Tian Fang had come into contact with the first generation once, and it seemed that he had many ideas that no one could guess."Huntian ... Ninefold guard ..."They were not weak."And this time, a large number of tier 9 subordinates will come to help me. Tian Fang's people will also help me. Is Tian Fang ... Trying to weaken the strength of the other tier 9 subordinates?To let their people die in this siege?This would allow the Lord of Tian Fang to gain the upper hand once again!As he absorbed the chaotic will, his mind became clearer and clearer. Compared to the confusion when he first arrived, he seemed to be calmer."If I'm killed by order, order will become even stronger ... If huntian is really infinitely close to level nine, spring and autumn of the South and Li Hao of the East will not be huntian's match ... The unification is inevitable!"This way, he could get rid of a lot of trouble. Even forcing Li Hao of the East to ask for help from a rank-9 and even pay a price, including having time controlled ... There might still be hope.And if he killed huntian and established order in the chaos ... They would not lose anything.Most of the people gathered here were tier 9 subordinates and not his own.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Many thoughts appeared in his mind."Sky Gold, come and see me!" The chaos Emperor suddenly said.In the distance.The five-element Overlord's boss was a little unhappy. However, he quickly reappeared in the five-element Hall that used to belong to him when he heard the voice."Venerable, what are your orders?"Supreme Emperor Sky Gold asked in a deep voice. He was still a little unhappy with chaos's repeated excessive demands."Have the people of the other Dao Masters arrived?""Some have arrived, not many. Currently, there are only four rank eights and seven rank Sevens ... They are under the command of the Yin Yang path master and the life and death path master.""Is this all you have?""That's right!" Chaos seemed very dissatisfied,"before I descended, all the grade-9 experts promised me that they would gather with me as soon as possible and listen to my orders! And now, other than Tian Fang and Wu Xing, only four level 8s have arrived?"It looked like a lot, but in reality ... It was really very little.There were so many level nine venerable sovereigns!In the depths of the primordial chaos, there were more than twenty self-proclaimed rank-9s.It wasn't like they were in the minority. There were still a few left in the family, and even if they were not as good as Tian Fang, they would not be too few. But now?A mere four!Are you trying to send away a beggar?"Perhaps some people haven't recovered yet, or they don't know that the venerable one is in the North," Sky Gold continued."But even if huntian attacks ... There aren't many level eights in the West, and the venerable one is keeping watch. With us ..."He didn't understand what this ninth-rank numinous being had to worry about.The North was also an Overlord force.Even if the West is stronger than the North, there's a limit to how much stronger they are. Alright, he admits that he's not as good as huntian, but aren't you here?On the surface, he only had four to five grade 8 experts.Even if there were a few in the dark, how many could there be?But now?There were eight level 8 venerable sovereigns in the five elements realm. Outside the five elements realm, there were three more level 8 venerable sovereigns who could be mobilized. This time, another four level 8 venerable sovereigns had come, making a total of 15 level 8 venerable sovereigns!In addition, there were a large number of seventh level venerable sovereigns ...It could be said that at this moment, Sky Gold felt that if huntian dared to come, even with spring and autumn, they would probably die.The ninefold guards?It had been destroyed countless years ago. Even if it still existed, how many people were left?As far as he knew, there were no signs of large-scale mobilization of powerhouses in the West.

Chapter 3669 Order And Chaos (2)
Chaos was a ninth level venerable sovereign, what was there to be afraid of?The chaos Emperor only gave him a cold look.The five elements in the North were indeed stupid.No wonder he was looked down upon the most among the four sides.No one looked down on them!I cultivate chaotic will, and I'm still at the ninth step, but I didn't get completely carried away. This guy who was lucky enough to enter the eighth step, two of his five brothers died one after another, and he still hasn't made any progress.She didn't think that he was weak at all. She only felt that he was unlucky.They still believed that the North had the power to rule the world. How foolish. It would be great if everyone in the chaos was like this. Tian Fang did not need to plan anything at all. He could just descend and finish the matter. A clone would be able to eliminate all the powerful enemies of the chaos.Even Tian Fang and calamity's avatars had been destroyed, but this person still felt that they were invincible in the primal Chaos.15 tier 8!Was it a lot?Quite a lot.But ... Don't you know how strong you are?If there were 15 of them, chaos would naturally not be worried. However, these 15, even if the five elements worked together, they would only be comparable to long Zhan. They might not even be as good as the five elements Overlord. Even if the three of them worked together ... There was a high probability that they would not be a match for an existence like spring and autumn.What was there to be arrogant about?He was probably not even as good as the commander of the ninefold guards."How many Dao crystals have you collected?""What's wrong?" chaos asked again, not bothering to explain.Tian Jin raised his brows slightly. Seeing that the chaos was no longer continuing, he could only say,"Over ten billion ... Most worlds don't have much in reserve, and many experts have fled ..."Therefore, it wasn't too much.The chaos Emperor frowned slightly.He thought to himself that simply devouring the power of a great Dao wouldn't make him return to his peak. Only if the chaotic spirits became stronger and made their spirituality stronger could he become stronger.The unrest in the North would only make his Dao of chaos stronger, but it was not enough ...He glanced at Supreme Emperor Skygold from the corner of his eye and suddenly smiled.""Not bad ... Also, get the others to come as soon as possible. Huntian might have already arrived in the North. We have to finish the battle quickly to avoid attracting the attention of other experts!""Alright," he said.Tian Jin nodded.Just as he was about to leave, chaos suddenly thought of something and said,""Oh right, have you condensed your spirituality?""What?"Tian Jin was slightly stunned. Chaos shook his head. "It's alright, you can leave first!"Upon hearing this, Supreme Emperor Sky Gold could only turn around and leave.After he left, chaos shook his head. Obviously, this guy had not condensed. He was indeed a piece of trash.There must be a spirit of order in chaos.Li Hao also had a spirit. Although it wasn't the spirit of time, it still had a spirit. Last time, he had tricked calamity.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ He wasn't sure if the human King had it, but long Zhan had it. It was the spirit of chaos.Did spring and autumn exist? It was hard to say, but there was a high chance that there were. Only the five elements in the North didn't have any ... That made sense. The five elements spirits might have been occupied by the five elements Dao master, but he hadn't condensed any. He was still a good-for-nothing.Such a person, even a million years ago, it would be hard to achieve tier 9 too."Huntian ..."He mumbled to himself and did not say anything. He continued to extract large amounts of great Dao power to perfect his own cultivation.However, he had already made some preparations.……At the northern border.The turbulence continued.A large number of experts fled, but before they could escape, they were hunted down by the existence in the darkness.One after another, powerful figures appeared in the surroundings. The cultivators who were trying to escape were all killed by the ninth layer guards who were lying in ambush.The entire North was in constant turmoil, but the chaos ... Was incomparably quiet.Huntian Supreme Emperor was expressionless.Chaos!If the entire North was in chaos, he would be crippling his own hands and feet. Sky Gold and the others had actually completely stirred up the North under his jurisdiction ... This was good too. He could save himself a lot of trouble.Beside him, the black shadow was also a little jubilant. At this moment, the black shadow was also a little excited."Path master, a large number of experts in the North have fled, and countless have died or been injured. Even if we don't attack the North this time, the North will still be extremely weak in the future ...""Yes."Huntian nodded slightly and looked at the five elements region.""Have everyone withdraw and prepare to follow me to the five elements!"Was he about to attack?The black shadow was extremely excited and sent out a weak energy wave. Around it, many black shadows flickered toward this side.The experts arrived quickly, but they didn't make a sound.However ... They all seemed a little excited.Order had returned!The ninefold guards reappeared in the chaos.Just like in the past, he intimidated everyone!After a while, dozens of black shadows gathered. There were at the eighth and seventh level. There were more than ten at the eighth level, and dozens at the seventh level. They were like shadows in the dark.Under order, there was also darkness.With a powerful deterrent force, he would kill all the rebels and establish a bright order. This was true order. The master of order in the past was not ruthless enough. A large number of rebels were not killed ...As a result, order collapsed.Today's huntian was even more iron-blooded than the previous generation's order!Only in this way could true order be established.Any existence that resisted ... Would be destroyed and killed!This was what huntian had learned over the years. Reality had proven that its understanding of order was very successful. It had been in place in the West for many years and all the resistance forces there had been defeated.Now, even if there was unrest in the West, the backyard would not catch fire.It would only be an external existence that interfered with the operations of the West.
