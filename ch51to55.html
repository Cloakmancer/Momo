           Chapter 51: Chapter 16: teacher (1)
           Translator: 549690339
           On this day, Li Hao didn’t do anything but ask and listen.
           
           Apart from seeing Liu Long once in the morning, he was nowhere to be seen the rest of the time. He might have gone to set up something.
           
           As for the law-enforcement team, they didn’t transfer Li Hao away.
           
           Perhaps they were worried about alerting the enemy, so they didn’t go through the transfer procedures. Other than the few members of the demon hunting team, only Wang Jie in the critical room knew about the situation.
           
           ……
           
           At six in the afternoon.
           
           It was time to get off work.
           
           Li Hao packed up. The vortex Mk III was still with him. Although Liu Yan allowed him to choose some weapons, Li Hao did not choose them for the time being. The more powerful a weapon was, the more inconvenient it was to carry around.
           
           As for the grenades, Li Hao took a few. They weren’t too big and could be kept in his pocket, provided they didn’t explode.
           
           He looked up at the sky. It was clear.
           
           It probably wouldn’t rain tonight.
           
           “Demon-hunting squad ...”
           
           Li Hao got on the bicycle. He looked back at the inspector’s office, and then at the law enforcement building in the distance. He seemed to feel a pair of eyes, or several pairs of eyes, observing him.
           
           Liu Long?
           
           Now, were these people already staring at him? had the bait plan already begun?
           
           “I can’t not trust Liu Long, but I can’t completely trust him either!”
           
           Li Hao had his own judgment. He wasn’t familiar with Liu Long, so it was impossible for them to hit it off at first sight. If Liu Long was on the side of justice, he might not have intentionally harmed Li Hao. However, if he had really been killed by the red shadow, then so be it!
           
           Liu Long would not even bat an eye if he sacrificed himself to kill a superhuman.
           
           Even the teacher had nothing to say!
           
           Liu Long didn’t kill him personally, so his teacher couldn’t say anything. Li Hao judged that Liu Long didn’t ask about the saber and sword, perhaps it had something to do with his teacher. The position of Captain of the law enforcement team still restricted Liu Long.
           
           After all, he wasn’t on the side of the evil order.
           
           He was from the inspection Office, and there was a night patrol watching his back.
           
           “Even if teacher didn’t do anything, actually ... He still vaguely saved me.”
           
           Li Hao was well aware that without Yuan Shuo, even if Liu Long didn’t kill him, he would definitely ask about the sword and saber. He might even use the excuse of evidence as bait to force Li Hao to hand it over.
           
           But now, the other party was clearly feigning ignorance, obviously because he was wary of Yuan Shuo.
           
           “I’m still too weak!”
           
           A creak was heard.
           
           Li Hao got on his bicycle. He didn’t know if the Red Shadows were watching him or if Liu Long and the others were following him. These people were deliberately avoiding him, so it would be difficult for him to notice them.
           
           “Only self-improvement!”
           
           Li Hao said quietly. Even Liu Yan, who was extremely warm to him, didn’t dare to believe him. If he really encountered danger, she might not necessarily save him.
           
           “I hope I can be stronger before they make their move!”
           
           Li Hao didn’t dare to drink too much of the sword water before. On one hand, it took a long time to digest, and on the other hand, he was worried that he would use up all the mysterious energy.
           
           But at this moment, Li Hao realized that if he died, it would be useless no matter how much mysterious energy he had.
           
           Therefore, he had to make more and drink more!
           
           Not only that, Li Hao even considered whether he could destroy the Jade sword and release more mysterious energy. At this point, he didn’t care whether it was a family heirloom.
           
           If the Jade sword didn’t work, wasn’t there a stone knife at home?
           
           ……
           
           The bicycle moved forward slowly.
           
           Li Hao’s eyes were dazzled, and he didn’t care about anything else.
           
           Soon, they arrived at Qiming community.
           
           Block 6, unit 302.
           
           Before he even entered the door, the Black Panther scuttled out from the corner like a shadow. This fellow’s speed was even faster than before.
           
           “Woof!”
           
           The Black Panther wagged its tail, as if to say that everything was safe today. After Li Hao left, no one seemed to care about where he lived, nor did anyone come to check.
           
           Li Hao, on the other hand, glanced at the Black Panther, which seemed to be a little bigger than yesterday, and patted its head.
           
           He pushed the door open and entered.
           
           Li Hao took off his clothes and turned on the light. The room was still dark, and the curtains were tightly drawn.
           
           Li Hao sat on the sofa and thought about everything that had happened in the past two days.
           
           It was too fast!
           
           It made him feel like he was having a hard time digesting the information, and he was unable to clearly analyze the various clues.
           
           “The demon-hunting squad, the red shadow side, the night patrollers, the eight great families ...”
           
           “And I may be the sole survivor of the eight great families!”
           
           “The Red Shadows ‘target is me, and the Demon Hunter squad’s target is the supers on the Red Shadows’ side. The night patrolmen might not come because they are busy, but teacher is about to set off, so the other party might have sent someone here!”
           
           “The red shadow we met last night and the existence behind the red shadow, were they all of the red shadow’s men, or ... Was it just one of them?”
           
           How many supers were there?
           
           Li Hao didn’t know!
           
           However, Li Hao guessed that there might be more than one. The one last night was probably just a stalker and not all of the red shadow’s people.
           
           “Liu Long, have you considered this? If it wasn’t just one superhuman, but two, three, or even four, would the demon-hunting squad be able to handle it?”
           
           Li Hao gently knocked on the table. Although the demon hunting squad had given him some help, they still couldn’t give him a sense of security.
           
           There were thousands of things to think about!
           
           At this moment, no one could help him.
           
           The next moment, he thought of someone. After a moment of hesitation, Li Hao took out his communicator. He needed his teacher’s help, not necessarily practical help. Even if it was just to comfort him, it was fine.
           
           ……
           
           Silver City ancient Academy.
           
           Yuan Shuo was practicing an extremely ugly set of fist techniques in the courtyard. It was not accurate to call it a fist technique, but more like a fluttering old hen.
           
        
          Chapter 52: Chapter 16 teacher (2)
          Translator: 549690339
          This wasn’t a chicken fist, but a flying bird technique!
          
          It was one of the five birds technique.
          
          Tiger, deer, bear, ape, and bird. The ape technique was light and allowed one to escape easily. The flying bird technique was also a light technique, but it was even better at escaping than the ape technique. Of course, each of the five bird techniques was a killing technique!
          
          Be it the ape art or the flying bird art, they all had a set of killing techniques.
          
          It was just that Li Hao hadn’t studied these things deeply and thoroughly enough. He had always practiced the ape art as an escape art.
          
          Buzzzzzz!
          
          Yuan Shuo’s movements were slow and he did not seem to be using much strength. When he punched, it was like an old hen flapping its wings. There was no beauty to it. However, the sound of air exploding was heard in the courtyard.
          
          A Martial Master with over a hundred points!
          
          He was once one of the top figures in the field of martial Dao.
          
          However, as he grew older, his physical strength declined. Coupled with the appearance of superpowers and the proliferation of firearms, this generation had gradually retired from the martial arts world. In the eyes of outsiders, he was just a pure scholar, a top expert in the ancient civilization Department.
          
          “Ding ding ding!”
          
          Yuan Shuo was pulled out of the thump after a ring. He glanced at the communicator on the side and picked it up.
          
          “You went to the law enforcement team?”
          
          “En!”
          
          Yuan Shuo wasn’t surprised. Since he, the last disciple, had said that he was going, he wouldn’t hesitate.
          
          It was as if he knew what Li Hao needed.
          
          “Not confident anymore?” Yuan Shuo laughed. Did Liu Long give you a bad scare today? Do you think you’re useless and can’t survive outside?”
          
          “A little.”
          
          Li Hao didn’t deny it. “Teacher,” he said softly,”with the appearance of superpowers, do you think Xuewen still has a future?”
          
          After witnessing the strength of those people, Li Hao thought, is there really a future for studying literature?
          
          In the future, would this world be the world of supers?
          
          Would they, the non-supers, be able to live and work in peace like they did now?
          
          “There’s naturally no way out if you only study literature! But pure violence has no way out!”
          
          “I’ve never heard of anyone who can rule over everything just by using force!”Yuan Shuo said firmly. The wisdom of humans was the key to unifying the world and becoming the master of the world! For martial artists to learn literature, it took twice the effort with half the results! For scholars to learn martial arts, it was twice the result with half the effort! Don’t think that you’ve wasted all your time. Wrong, you’re only building your foundation. Even if you really enter the superpower realm, you’ll realize that wisdom and knowledge are priceless treasures that will make your path smoother!”
          
          He needed to clear up the students ‘confusion.
          
          Preach, teach, and dispel doubts!
          
          It was Li Hao’s first time coming into contact with superpowers, so it was normal for him to doubt himself. But at this moment, he couldn’t waver his belief.
          
          “Back then, my superpowers weren’t obvious, and I was one of the few people who stood at the top of the world in terms of martial arts. But I’m famous not because I can fight, but because of my research in the field of ancient civilization!”
          
          “After that, firearms developed rapidly. In our generation, those who purely practiced martial arts didn’t have a good ending. The more famous they were, the faster they died! I, on the other hand, have lived to this day, and even now, I’m a guest of honor in the eyes of the supers ... Even though there are some restrictions, I’m still doing well. ”
          
          “Supers are strong now, but that doesn’t mean that no one can restrain them or punish them ...”
          
          Yuan Shuo said a lot, and Li Hao listened quietly.
          
          His mood gradually became more cheerful.
          
          After a while, Yuan Shuo laughed heartily and said,””Don’t worry too much about the law enforcement team. If you really encounter any trouble, Liu Long and the others might not be able to solve it. As I said before, you can come to my place to lie low. ”
          
          “Teacher, do the night patrols know about the situation in Blizzard Silver City?” Li Hao asked after some thought.
          
          “I’m not sure. I might know, but even if I know, I might not appear immediately. Liu Long and the others are just cannon fodder and Pathfinders!”
          
          Yuan Shuo’s words were dripping with blood, and the true situation of the demon hunting squad was bone-chilling!
          
          “There aren’t many night watchers, and every superhuman is a treasure that can not be easily sacrificed! The Silver City’s situation was still unclear, so he would let Liu Long and the other cannon fodders test the waters first. If Liu Long and the others could successfully take it down, then everyone would be happy! If they can’t take them down, the night patrolmen will be able to make a general judgment. They will know themselves and their enemies, and know what kind of strength they should use to deal with the Silver City’s troubles. This is the reason why the night patrolmen rarely appear. ”
          
          He wanted to maintain his own sense of mystery and let outsiders not know the inside story.
          
          Liu Long and the other peripheral organizations were only Pathfinders. If they died, then so be it. It was not a loss.
          
          If he could kill supers, advance, and join the night patrollers, he would be able to strengthen the night patrollers.
          
          This was the nature of the dark clouds in Blizzard Silver City!
          
          As for Yuan Shuo, he had long seen through these intrinsic qualities.
          
          Li Hao gently exhaled. How realistic!
          
          His teacher’s words allowed him to see through some of the fog. He also completely understood that the demon hunting squad was not completely unrelated to the night patrollers. Perhaps ... Liu Long himself was an outer member of the night patrollers?
          
          It was not impossible!
          
          At this moment, Yuan Shuo suddenly said,””Don’t think too much. If you don’t want to come to my place, I won’t force you to come! Since you’ve already understood some of the situation, I’ll explain it to you briefly so that you can have as much self-protection as possible. ”
          
          What?
          
          Li Hao had thought that his teacher was going to give him a treasure, but that wasn’t the case.
          
          The next moment, Yuan Shuo suddenly used a secret code to communicate with him. This was a special way of communication between Yuan Shuo and his students. For people like Yuan Shuo, it was very easy to create a special way of transmitting information.
          
           


          Chapter 53: Chapter 16-teacher (3)
         Translator: 549690339
“The Li family’s sword, the Zhang family’s saber ... The appearance of these families in the song and their supernatural items were a joke in the past. But now, it may not be the case!”

Li Hao was startled, but he returned to normal in the next moment.

Even Liu Long could guess it, not to mention his own teacher. In Li Hao’s opinion, his teacher was perhaps the smartest and wisest person he had ever met.

“If you have these things, it’ll be a blessing and also a curse!”

“Zhang Yuan’s death might be related to this. It’s obvious that you’ve been targeted by supers, and their target might be these things. As for the song of the eight great families, it has been passed down for countless years. Even I, who have heard it, don’t know when it started spreading, and there are no records of it, it has been passed down from generation to generation ...”

“According to my research, it might be related to the ancient civilization. You are my student, so you know a little about the ancient civilization. The new book of five birds was actually found in the ruins of the ancient civilization, and I made some modifications to it later.”

Li Hao didn’t say anything and just listened to his teacher.

“There’s a common characteristic about the treasures in the song. Outsiders are unable to use them. Perhaps the reason why Zhang Yuan was burned was to extract his bloodline, soul, or mental energy, and thus, was able to use the Zhang clan’s saber!”

“As for the time span, I’ve made some deductions. It’s very likely that the other party’s superpower means are limited. Every time we burn the other party’s blood and soul, it may cause the method to enter a dormant period!”

“However, it is obvious that the enemy is improving. Or rather, the dormancy period is shortening!”

Li Hao hurriedly nodded, even though Yuan Shuo couldn’t see him.

But at this moment, Li Hao was full of admiration. His teacher didn’t know anything. He only read the file yesterday, but he could deduce so many things today. Li Hao couldn’t help but be impressed.

Of course, it also had to do with his teacher’s vast knowledge.

“There’s one more thing. The other party always strikes on rainy days, which means that his ability might only be able to be used on rainy days. What he needs is not just to kill, but to extract what he obtains from you after killing you.”

At this point, Yuan Shuo paused for a moment before he continued,””Don’t underestimate the person behind this case. You have to know that if the first person to die is from the Zheng family, it means that the other party has been around for at least 15 years!”

“You have to know that superpowers only appeared about 20 years ago. If the other party was a superpower from the start, do you know what that means? The other party is an old hand among the supers, not a newbie who has just absorbed energy into his body!”

“Of course, this might not be done by one person,” Yuan Shuo said.”Perhaps the supers who started this had already left, and now it’s the other party’s organization members or disciples who are keeping watch. After all, a strong person can’t stay in Silver City forever.”

Li Hao took another deep breath. He had considered this point before, but not as carefully as his teacher.

Had Liu Long considered this?

“You might not be able to use the Zhang family’s saber! However, you can definitely do it with the Li family’s sword! Superpowers ... Should have existed since the ancient civilization era. Now, they have just been resurrected, and they did not appear all of a sudden. If you are the Li family descendant of the Li family swords, you can find a way to activate this sword if you have it. ”

“Activate?”

Li Hao finally spoke. The Li family’s sword was a secret, but it wasn’t a secret either. Those who had heard the song of the Xun might have thought about it, but no one had seen it before.

.

Was he considered to have activated?

Water bubble sword!

“Yes, activate! It had been sealed for many years, so how could it be used so easily? I know many ways to activate it, but they are all too difficult for you. The simplest way is to bind it with blood ... The premise is that this sword really belongs to your family and not stolen. ”

“Teacher, it’s no use!” Li Hao smiled bitterly.

It was dripping with blood!

“Nonsense, it’s definitely useless if you drip a drop of blood on it. Do you think a blood contract is just a stupid drop of blood?”

“……”

Was it not?

Li Hao was speechless.

Yuan Shuo continued,”this blood is not just any blood. It’s especially so for descendants like you who have been here for who knows how many generations. Your bloodline is already different.” For you, it’s possible to unseal the two types of blood. “The first one is the blood from your heart ... Actually, I don’t recommend this because the damage is too great. However, if you encounter a life-and-death crisis and are almost killed by someone, you can stab your own heart. Don’t be too harsh, just stab yourself to death!”

“……”

Li Hao was embarrassed.

It was indeed dangerous!

“Second, cultivate the five birds technique diligently to strengthen your physique and improve your bloodline. If you can reach my level, you might be able to unseal yourself with a drop of blood!”

Li Hao was tempted. Over a hundred?

However, he was running out of time!

“Teacher, are there any mysterious powers in the superitems?” he asked.

“Yes, yes, and no. It depends on the situation.”

“If yours has it, you can try to absorb a little. It might not be of much use!” Yuan Shuo quickly replied.

Li Hao was startled. Not much use?

This was something that he had high hopes for!

“Teacher, isn’t it said that one can become a super by drawing energy into the body?”

“What are you thinking? It won’t be that simple!”

“Of course, I’m not too sure about your situation. Let me explain what I know. Some supernatural items contain some mysterious power, but it’s very weak. If you can absorb it, it might help you improve your physique, but it won’t be as useful as you think. It’s almost impossible to become a superpower with it!”


Li Hao’s eyes revealed a hint of disappointment.

“Of course, it’s hard to say. After all, we have too little research on superpowers and we haven’t been out for long. We don’t have any specific reference case.”

Yuan Shuo continued,”this is also the key point. You probably really have that thing. Then I’ll teach you a set of breathing techniques that are not recorded in the” new book of five birds “!”

“A breathing method?”

“Yes, it’s more complete than the breathing technique. I’ve combined many ancient books and reorganized them to complete it over the years.”

“Because you, kid, don’t know how to absorb the mysterious energy!”

Yuan Shuo laughed,”you’ve never come into contact with superpowers before. It won’t be of much use to teach you this! “Even if you didn’t come to me today, I would have come to you and taught you the new breathing technique of five birds. It’s for the sake of absorbing the mysterious energy. However, in our daily lives, we almost can’t absorb the mysterious energy. You’re different. You might have already come into contact with it. This is your chance!”

“Teacher, then can you draw ...”

“Me?”

Yuan Shuo laughed,”you want to share it with me?” Forget it, a super item might not have much mysterious power. To me, it’s like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood! Let me put it this way, the stronger you are, the harder it is to become a super! Our transformation is much more difficult than ordinary people ‘s! Liu Long actually had a high chance of advancing directly, but this guy’s martial cultivation was not low, so it was particularly difficult for him to advance! If you don’t have any Foundation in martial arts, it’ll be easier for you ... Of course, you’ll be weaker after you become a Starlight master. ”

Li Hao was suddenly enlightened!

So that was how it was!

“That’s why, a little bit of mystery energy is good for you, but for me ... It’s useless! If you can’t become a superhuman after absorbing the mysterious energy, your martial arts Foundation will become even stronger. As time goes on, it’ll be hard for you to level up. ”

“It doesn’t matter!”

Li Hao didn’t really care. He was just curious.””Teacher, you mean that the stronger the martial Dao Foundation, the stronger it will be after the advancement?”

“Nonsense! Take me, for example. I’m a Martial Master who’s over a hundred. If I’m still on the same level as the weakest star light Master after advancing, then what’s the point of advancing? The weakest Starlight master, if he really comes, it’s hard to say who will be the one to kill who!”

Without saying much about himself, Yuan Shuo said sternly,””Alright, don’t ask these useless questions! And don’t think about me, you’re too weak, it’s a waste of time! I’ll teach you the breathing technique of five birds, but you’d better remember that you’re not allowed to teach it to anyone! Your teacher’s hard work over the years is all on this. Superpowers have only been around for 20 years. The things that the night watchers have come up with might not even be as powerful as mine!”

“This is the power of knowledge. They don’t know sh * t about supers. Even though I’m not a superhuman, I knew about the existence of supers even earlier than these guys. I’ve read about them in books forty years ago ...”

After Yuan Shuo praised himself for a while, he stopped talking nonsense and began to describe his breathing technique of five birds.

At this moment, Li Hao was listening attentively.

He felt that it was quite simple!

Even though his teacher had praised it, he only felt that it was slightly better than the breathing technique. As for how much better it was, he didn’t really have much of an opinion.

What Li Hao didn’t know was that Yuan Shuo, who had been the first to learn about superpowers and studied the ancient civilization’s superpowers, had not only gained his own understanding but also integrated a large number of the ancient civilization’s superpowers into it.

The breathing technique of five birds might sound simple, but it might be the most powerful cultivation method in the entire superpower realm.

Li Hao, on the other hand, adjusted his breathing as he listened.

The breathing method was not only different in the rhythm of breathing, but also contained other things, such as the adjustment of posture. At this moment, Li Hao was like a big Frog, with his belly facing up and his five hearts facing the sky. His posture was very stupid.

The starry sky sword, which had been silent all this time and could only be drawn out by the bubble sword, suddenly flickered as it hung on Li Hao’s neck.

In the next moment, a dense wave of mysterious energy poured into Li Hao’s body.

Originally, this mysterious energy would have leaked out very quickly.

However, at this moment, Li Hao’s pores seemed to be breathing as he swallowed a large amount of mysterious energy.

Countless pores were absorbing the mysterious energy!

It was faster than he had imagined, much faster than he had imagined!

On the other side of the communicator, Yuan Shuo had finished speaking. When he saw that Li Hao had stopped moving, he couldn’t help but shake his head.

.

“Young man, you just can’t hold your temper. Are you cultivating while listening?”

After giving it some thought, he realized that the fellow might have already absorbed a portion of the mysterious energy.

Yuan Shuo smiled and hung up the communication. He shook his head and said,””He’s still too young. He looks smart, but he’s actually very stupid! There was no sound after he started cultivating, so it’s obvious that he absorbed the mysterious energy. In that case, the Li family’s sword is by his side, or is it simply on him?”

“If it’s by your side, it’s too obvious ... Then it’s on your body?”

Yuan Shuo thought for a moment and was a little surprised.”Good boy, the Li family’s sword is not simple! I thought it was really a big sword, so it’s that small jade pendant?”

If Li Hao were here, he would probably feel his scalp go numb!

Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, recalled the jade pendant that Li Hao was wearing. He shook his head again and chuckled.”Amazing, I’m afraid this sword is not simple! I don’t feel any difference, and it’s so small ... If I hadn’t seen it before, I wouldn’t have guessed that it was the Li family’s sword!”

“I’ve passed the ‘five birds breathing technique’ to this kid. I wonder how much I’ve gained ... It’s been sealed for so many years, and there might not be much mysterious energy on that sword. If I’m lucky, I’ll be able to obtain superpowers. If I’m unlucky, after absorbing it, I’ll be able to cut five or six times, not ten times, right?”

Yuan Shuo made a judgment based on his own experience. It was still not safe.

This matter was not that simple.

A superpower that appeared fifteen years ago. Even if there was no improvement in the past fifteen years, the weakest one would be over a hundred. It was definitely not something that ordinary people could deal with.

It had even exceeded 100 and reached the thousand-man combat in martial arts!

In that case, firearms would be almost useless.

If the power was too great, they would be killed before they could kill the enemy.

……

While Yuan Shuo was thinking about this, Li Hao was also absorbing the mysterious energy.

So many!

Li Hao’s consciousness was still clear, as it was much stronger than the bubble sword. At this moment, he was facing the sky, his heart in shock. His teacher’s “breathing technique of five birds” was so powerful. It could really absorb the mysterious energy, and at an extremely fast speed.

His Constitution was transforming.

At this moment, Li Hao could even vaguely feel that there were chains in his body that were sealing off the mysterious energy. Otherwise, the mysterious energy would enter some core areas, such as his heart and brain.

“A superpower lock?”

Li Hao had some speculations. Could this be the Super Lock that Liu Yan mentioned before, the lock that separated the mortal world from superpowers?

“Too many!”

Li Hao didn’t have time to think. In the next moment, he felt that he had absorbed too much, and his body was about to explode.

This feeling was even more than drinking ten cups of water!

“Practice martial arts!”

The next moment, Li Hao jumped up and hit his head.

His body was covered in dazzling Starlight!

At the side, the Black Panther’s eyes were wide open, and it kept sticking out its tongue to lick.

Not only that, the Black Panther seemed to have realized something. It suddenly lifted its limbs, and its breathing rhythm was exactly the same as Li Hao ‘s.

Li Hao didn’t hide his practice of the breathing technique of five birds from this guy, nor did he want to hide it from a dog.

At this moment, the mysterious energy exuding from Li Hao’s body suddenly stopped spreading, and instead rushed toward the Black Panther.

The Black Panther’s four limbs were facing upwards, and its breathing was regulated. Every breath it took was also dazzling like Starlight!

In the small room, a person was jumping around like a monkey.

A dog that looked like a human with its four limbs facing up was swallowing and spitting Starlight. It was especially horrifying!

In the room, Starlight energy flickered, but it did not overflow.

Outside the room, even if there were people, even supers, they could not see or feel it.

The mysterious energy that was overflowing from the starry sky sword didn’t have a large range of radiation. After a certain range, it would quickly dissipate and disappear into the space.

Moreover, Heibao was here.

The overflowing mysterious energy had been completely absorbed by this guy, and there was no overflow.

Li Hao had overdone it!

At this moment, he felt full of energy and was restless. He kept practicing the ape art for three minutes per round, but Li Hao had no idea how many rounds he had practiced.

He felt that if he didn’t vent it out, he would explode.

I’ve absorbed too much!

Even so, Li Hao didn’t stop practicing the breathing technique of five birds. Of course, it wasn’t the complete version, but the breathing technique was still in use.

The breathing technique of five birds could actually be divided into two small Parts.

One was the complete version, which was a combination of the posture and the breathing technique. The other was a non-matching posture. In fact, a simple breathing technique could also absorb some mysterious energy, but the effect was not as good as a matching posture.

“Ha!”

A muffled shout sounded.

Li Hao, who had been jumping non-stop, suddenly stopped. His hands were like ape hooves as he grabbed at the wall.

The ape art was not just a light body technique.

In the past, Li Hao rarely used the ape Art’s killing technique, because there was no need for it.

At this moment, there was too much energy in Li Hao’s body. He couldn’t bear it. In addition, he would soon be in danger. He didn’t care about this. He bent his hands like an ape waving its claws.

Bang!

“Hiss!”

Li Hao took a deep breath. It hurts!

After all, his hand was still made of flesh. When he clawed at the wall, a few small holes appeared. However, Li Hao’s fingers were in so much pain that his nails were almost knocked off.

However, Li Hao couldn’t care less about the pain!

He instantly looked at the wall, and his eyes flickered.

Using his hands to grab the wall and make a few small holes in the flat wall was something that he couldn’t do before.

The contact area of his fingers was too small, so he could not exert much force.

Moreover, the wall was smooth, and there was a lack of strength to grab it.

It was not an earth wall, but a painted cement wall.

“Previously, Liu Long’s punch was even more powerful when he punched through the kitchen wall. Furthermore, the kitchen of the Zhang family was only made of red bricks ... Of course, he was still very strong. However, the current me seems to be much stronger than before!”

Li Hao was secretly shocked. Today, he only practiced the breathing technique of five birds, but he suddenly felt that he had become much stronger.

Of course, this had something to do with him being too weak.

The weaker it was, the more obvious the improvement.

.

At Liu Long’s level, there were many mysteries, but to them, it was just a drop in the bucket. It was impossible for there to be much changes.

“Teacher’s technique is still the best!”

Li Hao observed his fingers. They had been red and his nails were dark purple.

At this moment, as the mysterious energy continued to surge in, these small injuries quickly disappeared.

Li Hao also felt that his muscles had tightened.

His blood seemed to be flowing even faster!

The bone armor was also slowly changing.

That feeling, strictly speaking ... Was compression!

Yes, the mysterious energy seemed to have compressed Li Hao a little.

The original Li Hao was about 178 cm tall, not too tall, but not short either.

At this moment, although Li Hao didn’t measure his height, he felt that he was a little shorter. Perhaps it was only one centimeter or less, but Li Hao still felt that he was short.

It was being compressed!

His muscles were tight, and the gaps between his bones were even smaller.

“If this continues ... I won’t become much shorter, right?”

Li Hao felt a little strange. Liu Long was quite tall.

In the past, he had never seen anyone practice martial arts until they became shorter.

Of course, they had all started training at a young age. Unlike Li Hao, he had only started training at the ancient academy three years ago, and he hadn’t put much effort into it during those two years.

Li Hao didn’t delay.

The next moment, he suddenly opened his right hand. Instead of grabbing at the wall with his five fingers closed like before, Li Hao now opened his fingers and grabbed at the wall in front of him!

Bang! Bang!

With a crisp sound, mixed with some unpleasant sounds of nails rubbing against each other, his five fingers pierced directly into the wall. The hole was not deep, only leaving a palm print on the wall, but he did not touch the concrete structure inside.

But this time, the entire wall seemed to shake slightly. Perhaps it was just Li Hao’s illusion.

However, Li Hao felt that it was even more lethal than before.

“Tiger Claw!”

This was the attack method of the Tiger fighting technique in the new book of five birds.

Li Hao wasn’t very familiar with the other four birds technique, but that didn’t mean he didn’t know it. Yuan Shuo had taught him all of them, but Li Hao mainly used the ape technique.

He felt that the Tiger fighting technique was better for attacking.

Sure enough, when the Tiger Claw struck out just now, the way it was exerted was different. It wasn’t just a change in posture, but also a adjustment in breathing. The different way of exerting force immediately made Li Hao feel that the Tiger Claw struck out with more force!

The ape Art’s ape hooves explored the way, and its movements were light and fast, but the strength it used was far inferior to the Tiger’s claws.

“The Tiger fighting technique is indeed the most suitable for attacking among the five birds technique!”

Li Hao felt the subtle changes in his body, and he was moved.

His strength had increased!

His muscles reacted faster, and his body felt lighter.

It was as if he used to run with weights on his back, but now, he felt like he was running with less weights. Was this the effect of the mysterious energy?
