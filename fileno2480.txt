A small world, a newly born universe of the great path, actually gave birth to time ... This was actually very inconceivable.Even great DAOs as powerful as the universe of origin and the Crimson Moon universe did not have such a heaven-defying power like time.Summoning the past and the future ... This was truly going against the heavens!The past, the present, and the future should be the only one, not one to be summoned at will. Li Hao's reckless use of them, especially, had attracted the attention of chaos. He had even dared to summon beings at the level of world Lords.The primal Chaos lightning was also here to annihilate time.Time was too heaven-defying.It shouldn't have appeared here, and it shouldn't have appeared in the chaos.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶As soon as the seven Thunderbolts appeared, li daoheng's flesh and blood turned to dust. The bone spine sword will soared into the sky, but it also began to break. The sword will flowed between heaven and earth. In his body, Dao meridians appeared one after another, and the origin of the great Dao also appeared.Dual cultivation!He could be considered to be a true dual cultivator. He was actually cultivating a new Dao and had even devoured quite a bit of the power of reality Dao and Phantom Dao great DAOs. At this moment, a sword appeared inside the bone banner! It was obviously the kind of sword that could open 360 meridians.A long sword appeared in his body and pierced through the sky. Li Hao's sword intent was much weaker than his.This was a true swordsman!Seven bolts of lightning and countless destructive power filled his body. He continuously used sword intent to wear them down, and his bone armor also recovered from the cracks.On the other side, Red Moon sovereign's flesh and blood were also flying everywhere. A large amount of the red moon Power in his body turned into dust in an instant. He also turned into a bloody skeleton and looked at the sky silently without a word.It was already difficult for him to withstand seven bolts of lightning.On the other hand, Li Hao's situation was much better as he kept changing between illusions.The eighth Thunderbolt had already vaguely appeared."Shi Gu!" Li daoheng's voice rang out."You and I will work together to resist this!"He didn't call Li Hao along, because he was worried about Li Hao.Li Hao had already decided to die and drag them down with him. This guy had gone completely crazy.It was unnecessary to talk about cooperation with someone who didn't care about his life.He might as well look for Emperor Shi Gu!For a person like him to talk about cooperation, he knew that this was a difficult time. His previous thoughts of passing the chaos lightning tribulation to become an Emperor were extinguished. The chaos lightning tribulation was much more powerful than he had imagined!Li Hao ignored them. He looked at the sky in silence, and a sword appeared in his hand. At this moment, under the bombardment of the destructive Thunderbolts, he waved the long sword, and Dao meridians suddenly appeared in his body!The Dao meridian stars reappeared and hung high in the sky!The illusory energy in his body surged into these stars and opened his Dao Meridian!At this moment, Li Hao actually chose to open his Dao Meridian.Li Hao had opened 180 Dao meridians.But now, he had started the process of opening his Dao Meridian again. Bone-melting Imperial Emperor had turned into a blood-red skeleton and sneered. "Don't you think ... It's a little too late?" He had only started to open his Dao Meridian now!What had he been doing before?If you're not ready, what the hell are you doing? we could've discussed it earlier ... We could've waited for you, but why did you have to create that Primal Chaos lightning?Was it easy to become a venerable sovereign?He had come from the Crimson Moon universe to be the king of the heavens ... In the end, he did not become the king of the heavens. Instead, he was swept in by the sword of the sword venerable and almost killed.In the end, as soon as he entered, the Stargate closed, and he was sealed again. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt This coming out...Would be even more difficult.At that moment, he felt that he might have used up all his luck before he came here. He had a smooth life and became a venerable sovereign. Although he was not very powerful, he was only a venerable sovereign.Even in the Crimson Moon world, he was at the same level as a patriarch.Here ... He was worse than a grandson!This was still a small world!Where could he go to reason?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao ignored him. Stars appeared one after another. They all seemed illusory, because the source of Li Hao's power was illusory.Of the 180 stars that had been condensed, other than the time star, the other 179 stars were also floating in the air, covering the entire world. It seemed like the eighth lightning bolt was coming.Li Hao didn't care. He just looked at the sky in silence.One step at a time, no hurry.As long as I don't die, the thunder and lightning won't stop.Did he really think that he would be finished after nine?These two ... Were probably still thinking that they had a chance of surviving after going through the ninth Dao.The eighth Thunderbolt descended in an instant.Boom! Boom! Boom!This time, Li Hao was instantly blown to dust. The time star in his body also burst out with a powerful Time Force to resist the destructive power. The two forces collided, and the whole world seemed to be flowing backward!Not far away, li daoheng roared in anger. Using his body as a sword, he pierced through the sky!Countless bolts of lightning were reduced to dust.However, the remaining power of Thunder still cracked his bone armor. Some of his bone armor was even completely shattered. A half-skeleton appeared between heaven and earth. The endless destructive power was also destroying the sword intent on his body.Emperor Shi Gu roared and punched hundreds of times with his red skeleton. The eighth Thunderbolt was only extinguished when his fist turned into ashes and half of his body was shattered.Only half of the two skeletons remained.In Li Hao's body, Time and Stars flickered continuously. Gradually, even Time and Stars couldn't withstand it anymore. The power of time dimmed a lot, and finally, the destructive power was obliterated.Li Hao, on the other hand, reappeared and glanced at the time star in his body. He had consumed too much time power ... The ninth strike might not be able to be stopped by the star alone!

Chapter 2481 Catastrophe (1)_5
"F * ck!"At this moment, bone erosion Thearch emerged from the ground. Half of his red skeleton body appeared in the sky. He cursed and sneered."The ninth Dao...I ... Should still have a chance to survive!"There was still hope!Although he only had half of his body left, he felt that he still had a chance of passing the ninth lightning bolt.The three of them were all severely injured, but he realized that after being swept by the lightning, all the messy powers in his body had been swept away. The speed at which he recovered was quite fast.I can definitely withstand the ninth!Li Hao, you little bastard ... Just you wait!"I used to hate li daoheng the most, but now, it's changed. The seal that has been in place for a hundred thousand years isn't even as powerful as these eight bolts of lightning. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have broken the seal and come out.Li Hao was still condensing the stars in his Dao Meridian silently. One star after another kept appearing.In the void, more than 200 stars had appeared.It's not enough!He kept absorbing the energy around him. As the Heaven's Will, he had the advantage of being able to absorb the energy of the entire Silver Moon land. A large amount of energy gathered and helped Li Hao activate the stars.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ Such an action was simply a joke in the eyes of bone erosion Thearch. He might as well gather his energy to recover from his injuries. What was the use of increasing his strength now?Moreover, these stars were obviously illusionary. They were all condensed from the power of the future. When the power of the future receded, these stars would still collapse. What was the use?Gain some experience?More importantly, Li Hao, do you even have a future?Just as he was thinking, he suddenly screamed,""Let's carry it together!"As soon as he finished speaking, he instantly rushed to li daoheng's side and roared,""You and I will join forces and take turns to fight ..." He said.Otherwise, it would be difficult to block the ninth!This time, li daoheng didn't say anything. He didn't have any objections either. He was the one who suggested cooperation. Obviously, the bone-eroding Thearch couldn't take it anymore.An extremely thick bolt of lightning struck down from the sky!It had the power to destroy everything!Not far away, Tian Ji took a deep breath and prayed secretly. This attack had reached the power of some strong venerable sovereigns. It was difficult to kill venerable sovereigns ... But how could these three still have their previous strength?However, he no longer had the power of a venerable sovereign!Could Li Hao resist it?Fortunately, his power of the future hadn't completely dissipated yet. He was lucky. If his power of the future had dissipated now, he would have died without a doubt.BOOM! The huge sound shook the entire world. The Silver Moon world expanded once again. The mountains, the land, and the rivers were all expanding crazily. The seven main cities shook non-stop, and the great Dao of the hongyitang Hall appeared, suppressing the heavens and earth. However, there were still cracks in the ground, and countless buildings started to collapse.Fortunately, in the past year, the entire continent had been transformed. All the buildings were built by cultivators, so the buildings were relatively stable. If it were still the same as before, they would have all collapsed.Furthermore, all of the people were martial cultivators. Although they weren't very powerful, there were still quite a few Sun Moon experts of the mountains and seas who were making their moves to help stabilize the land. As soon as the lightning struck, these humans who had been frozen in time had already come to their senses.At this moment, they were all frightened and felt that the world would be split into pieces at any time.Countless cultivators began to walk out, either to save people or to quickly fill up the cracks in the ground. One by one, the earth-elemental powerhouses began to repair the ground, stabilize the buildings, and help some places.The ground extended crazily, and the buildings that were originally very close to each other were instantly pulled apart by hundreds of meters. The entire ground was expanding at an extremely rapid speed!The entire Silvermoon world was evolving at an unbelievable speed!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Near the Silver City, the three experts were facing the ninth Thunderbolt.Li daoheng used his sword and bone-corroding Emperor used his fist. The two skeletons attacked and resisted the lightning in a frenzy. The power of destruction swept through and the two of them were constantly shattered and then restored.At this moment, he had used all his trump cards.A blood-red bead even appeared in his body. The bead was like a sun, bursting with the power of the Crimson Moon. It was his most precious treasure.This was the power of the red moon that he had been unwilling to use for countless years. Now, he used it all without hesitation!As for li daoheng, all of his bones and armor had cracked open, turning into long swords.A monstrous sword formation appeared, using the bone Chi as a sword!The sword formation swept across the world and was constantly shattered by the lightning. The bone swords were turned into ashes. Under the joint attack of the two of them, they exhausted all their strength, and in a situation where they were almost certain to die, they were still lucky enough to escape. The next moment, the two of them completely destroyed the power of Thunder.In the air, there was only one bone sword left!The red bead was completely shattered, but bone Emperor laughed madly."Hahaha!"I'm finally alive!Li Hao is dead for sure, isn't he?He turned his head to look at Li Hao. A time star had appeared over there, erupting with powerful time power. However, it was quickly destroyed by the lightning. The entire time star dimmed in an instant, and the time power inside was almost completely consumed!Not only that, the power of the future in Li Hao's body was almost completely exhausted by the Thunderbolts.This was not enough. Li Hao continued to gather the power from all sides. As soon as he gathered it, it was instantly shattered, again and again. It was not until Li Hao's aura was extremely weak that the lightning completely dissipated.Bone Emperor was a little regretful ... He had actually survived.

Chapter 2482 The Catastrophe (1)_6
But ... It was almost there.This guy had completely used up his power of time. That's good. He's dead for sure now!In the air, the last bone sword turned into li daoheng. Li daoheng's face was so pale that he didn't look human, but he still smiled. He had successfully passed the Tribulation!At this moment, he felt that there was a huge change in his mentality.'I've even survived the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. I can only give myself some time to recover ... I'll definitely become a venerable sovereign without any shackles!'As for whether Li Hao was still alive ... What did it matter?The fake power in his body had been used up. Even if he recovered, without the power of time, Li Hao was just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.Of course, they had to be more careful in the celestial pole.While he was thinking, he suddenly discovered that Li Hao was still condensing stars. He didn't seem excited or worried at all. Stars appeared in the sky again, but they were still illusionary."It's useless to form Dao meridians now!"Emperor Shi Gu sneered. Li Hao, you've done me in. I won't be satisfied until you die today. You broke my Blood Moon divine Pearl ..."Just as he said that, his face suddenly changed and he looked up.Li daoheng was the same, and their expressions changed drastically!At that moment, a bolt of lightning appeared and Emperor Shi Gu shrieked in disbelief,""How can there be more?"The nine Thunderbolts had passed!At this moment, li daoheng's face also paled. He looked at Li Hao and suddenly said,""I know! As long as Li Hao doesn't die, the Thunder won't die!"The tenth Thunderbolt was coming!His face instantly turned pale. He couldn't block it anymore!Both he and bone erosion Emperor had exhausted all their resources in the ninth strike. It was already difficult for them to withstand nine strikes, but now ... The tenth strike was here!"Kill Li Hao!" He gritted his teeth and bellowed,"quick, kill Li Hao before the lightning strikes. We'll have some time in the second round!"Emperor Shi Gu had also recovered a bit of his flesh, but his face was as pale as a sheet.Kill Li Hao!Yes, kill Li Hao!Only by killing Li Hao would they have a chance of surviving this. Damn it! If he had known this would happen, he wouldn't have blocked the lightning and would have killed Li Hao from the beginning!At this moment, Li Hao said,"senior celestial pole, help me block it for a moment ..."Not far away, celestial pole's face was also pale.""Why is there more?""Senior, the lightning won't attack you. Help me block it for a while!"The two of them had exhausted a lot of energy. The celestial pole had been at its peak all this while, so it could still block them for a while.Tian Ji gritted his teeth and didn't care anymore. He carried his blood saber and charged over. He cursed in his heart. Why should I listen to him?Also, Li Hao had been weaving the Dao Meridian all this time. At this moment, there were almost 300 of them in the starry sky ... Was it useful? Would he be able to withstand the tenth lightning bolt?Would it work?Li Hao didn't know that the tenth Thunderbolt was about to strike. There was still some time left. He looked into the distance and said calmly,""Uncle Hong, Qian Wuliang, please lend me the power of the two universes!"In the distance, the two powerhouses 'expressions changed slightly, and they didn't say anything. Even Qian Wuliang quickly drew out a large amount of Phantom Dao power.In an instant, the starry Dao Meridian condensed in the air again.He was still a little short of 360.Li Hao didn't care about this. He reached out, and heaven and earth gathered. In an instant, a stone, a seal, and a tree flew out from the Silver Moon and turned into a barrier that covered the stars.These three had been buried in the Silver Moon world when Li Hao had transformed into heaven's will.At this moment, the three of them gathered again and formed a small world.Li Hao looked at the sky, slightly frowning. After pondering for a while, the time star in his body, which had exhausted its power of time, instantly appeared in the center of the small world, turning into a dim star in the center.Not far away, Heaven's Fate had already started fighting with the two powerhouses, and a loud boom erupted!Although Heaven's Fate was powerful and the two of them had consumed a lot of energy, they were also extremely crazy at the moment. They came with the intention of killing Li Hao. Li daoheng slashed out with his sword and roared,""I'll stop him, you go and kill Li Hao!"Tian Ji punched and slashed, but neither of the two experts was to be trifled with. Li daoheng turned into a sword and forced Tian Ji to retreat. Meanwhile, bone corrosion Imperial Emperor charged at Li Hao!If they didn't kill Li Hao, they would all be finished!Li Hao looked up at the sky and mumbled,"just a little bit more energy ... Not enough!."He turned to look at Emperor eroding bone. The power of 360 stars was still not enough.If this almost disabled venerable sovereign was included ... It should be enough.However, at this moment, he had almost exhausted all the energy in his body. Although the other party was disabled, he was still a venerable sovereign ... It would not be easy to kill him.Could he kill a venerable sovereign now?Li Hao suddenly laughed!In an instant, all eight major cities, including sword city, suddenly trembled. In the blink of an eye, all the major cities had gathered. The eight major cities trembled violently!BOOM!Each of the eight divine weapons was a hundred miles long. There was a sword, a saber, a whip ... They all appeared!The main city's divine weapon!The eight divine weapons appeared, and the firmament sword appeared in Li Hao's hand. He said softly,""Today, the mission of the eight divine weapons has been completed. The cat has been resurrected. Then ... Lend it to me. If I borrow too much ... I don't care about these anymore!"The eight godly weapons instantly appeared beside Li Hao under the control of heaven's will!  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ The eight divine weapons were created to seal the world and gather the power of heaven and earth to resurrect the cat. They were also left behind by the blood Emperor.

The firmament sword trembled violently. Li Hao smiled.""Swallow them ... Just leave the courtyard behind. Swallow them ... And you'll become a real divine sword!"The firmament sword trembled violently!He seemed to be a little excited, a little excited, and a little fearful ... Can I devour these eight divine weapons?At this moment, Li Hao's heaven's will power spread out, and the eight divine weapons trembled. Li Hao looked at the cat in the distance, who was still confused and curious."Senior cat, I fed you with heaven's will ... You owe me one. Now ... How about you lend me the eight major cities?"That's right, among the eight magic weapons, other than the stars sword of the sword Saint, the other seven actually belonged to the cat. Second cat was stunned for a moment. He nodded and shook his head. He was a little confused."Oh, oh ... Okay ... I'll lend it to you ... No, I'll give it to you, I don't need it anymore ..."As soon as the cat spoke, the other seven divine weapons quieted down except for the city of swords. The firmament sword was extremely excited and rushed out in an instant!With a crack, the sword pierced through a saber and the endless power of the divine weapon was devoured by the firmament sword!Li Hao also released his sword intent to suppress the stars sword.""This world should be surnamed li! Li daoheng can't represent the revered sword artist, but I ... Have the recognition of the sword tree, sword seal, and sword stone. I think I can represent him!"The stars sword trembled, and a small courtyard on the sword body suddenly flew away.Without the suppression of the courtyard, the stars sword shook for a while and gradually quieted down. The next moment, the firmament sword penetrated the stars sword and the eight divine weapons instantly merged into the firmament sword!In an instant, the sword's aura became so powerful that it could not be any more powerful!All of this happened in the blink of an eye. When Emperor Shi Gu arrived, he suddenly felt a majestic force and his expression changed!√®‚Ä∞¬π!This sword ... Had become a spirit?The firmament sword instantly became incomparably powerful. Holding it in Li Hao's hand, the firmament sword even began to tremble violently. It was excited, excited, and no longer restrained!This sword had surpassed all the other divine weapons. Among the eight divine weapons, there was even the sword of the sword Saint. One could only imagine how powerful this sword was."Bone erosion ... You should not have come to Silver Moon!"As Li Hao spoke softly, the stars in the sky instantly gathered in Li Hao's body. A boundless sword intent emerged from the firmament sword, as if it was as powerful as the sword venerable's longevity sword intent!At this moment, Li Hao's essence, spirit, and soul had become one. He was at his peak, even without the power of time!But at this moment, Li Hao suddenly laughed.Just as bone Emperor's expression changed, a long river of time suddenly appeared. Li Hao's figure trembled and he smiled bitterly. "You've come ... At the right time!"His past self had borrowed the force to come.The time was now.Lend or not?If he didn't lend it to him, he might have disappeared instantly because he would have died in the previous battle. If he did, he would have only had so much power left. Bone Emperor was right in front of him.A thousand sword intents ... It seemed that the present had indeed merged with the future thousand sword intents. So this was the time!  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ Li Hao shook his head. In an instant, a great amount of energy was drawn away. The power he had just gathered was instantly drawn away, and the power in his body was consumed in the blink of an eye. Emperor bone had wanted to escape, but he was stunned for a moment. Then, he burst out laughing."Karma!"Retribution!Li Hao suddenly lost his strength ... Hahaha!He was worried that he would die under the sword. The firmament sword had gathered the power of the stars, and the aura it exuded was even stronger than Li Hao's at his peak. But suddenly ... It was gone!If it was just a sword, he really wasn't afraid!At this moment, Heaven's Fate's expression also changed drastically.In the distance, Hong Yitang and the others 'expressions changed. How could it be now?Damn it!How could it be at this time!Li daoheng was also overjoyed. When the firmament sword swallowed the eight divine weapons, he thought that bone erosion was finished. But ... At this moment, Li Hao actually lost his power. He could see that Li Hao had borrowed it himself!If Li Hao didn't lend it to him now, the past would die, and the present wouldn't exist ... It might vanish in an instant, so he had no choice but to lend it to him.Li Hao shook his head slightly, looking helpless.It was ... Karma!The primal Chaos lightning was the retribution for this time. He had borrowed too much power from the future, and the dissipation of the power was the repayment for the previous time ... As expected, there was no free lunch in the world!Bone corrosion Imperial Emperor was overjoyed and threw a punch at Li Hao!Go to hell!If this fellow didn't die, he was worried that he would really die Here.Li Hao's expression was calm. Last time, his future self, the current him, told his past self that he would die this time, killed by an enemy ... He didn't say who, but he would die.At this moment.Did Emperor Shi Gu kill him?The firmament sword in his hand slashed out. However, without its master, the sword was just a sword. No matter how strong it was, like the blade of the blood Emperor, it could not kill a crippled venerable sovereign by itself.With his power depleted, it seemed like he had no chance of turning the tables.Not to mention Thunderbolt, he didn't have the chance now.Li Hao chuckled. Will I die?Perhaps!However, he would definitely not die at the hands of bone eroding Thearch!At this moment, heaven and earth changed. Suddenly, a figure appeared from the distance, shuttling through the void and overflowing with death energy.

Chapter 2484 The Catastrophe (8)
Li Hao looked at the dead man floating in front of him ... Laughed and said softly,""You died for me ... So I'll pull you out of hell. Lin Hongyu, I don't like to owe people favors ... You're no exception!"At this moment, the last wisp of time power suddenly overflowed from his body, and a star emerged from Li Hao's body. It was also lifeless.It was the convergence of ten thousand DAOs!That was Lin Hongyu's Natal star. It was covered in cracks, but it was surrounded by the power of time and had not completely shattered!The star merged into Lin Hongyu's body. Li Hao reached out his hand, and the power of vitality appeared in the void around him, not just from the others, but also himself. He smiled."Even if I die, I won't be killed by my enemies, I won't be killed by the corrosion of my bones ... You died for me ... I'll pay you back!"All the remaining life force in his body was absorbed by Lin Hongyu.Lin Hongyu's body was full of vitality.Lin Hongyu blinked and slowly opened her eyes. She was still exuding an aura of death, as if she had just crawled out of hell. She looked at Li Hao in a daze.Li Hao smiled. In the blink of an eye, his face aged and his hair turned gray.He reached out and the firmament sword suddenly returned to Lin Hongyu. Li Hao was extremely weak and his life was coming to an end. He chuckled and said,""Come ... One sword ... Kill a venerable sovereign!"The long sword fell into Lin Hongyu's hand. She stared at Li Hao, who was old and crumbling. Her eyes were filled with complicated emotions."Don't hesitate ... Kill him!"Li Hao chuckled,'he's not worthy ... I'll do it! You come and kill him!"Lin Hongyu's aura of death dissipated. She gritted her teeth, turned around, and wielded her long sword. At this moment, tens of thousands of stars gathered in her body, and the last bit of time power burst out. The firmament sword seemed to struggle. Li Hao shouted coldly,""Be obedient!"The firmament sword quieted down. In the next moment, an aura of death, vitality, time power, destructive power ... The power of 10000 DAOs emerged from Lin Hongyu's determination, anger, and hatred!This attack was not weaker than Li Hao's peak attack."Kill!"His furious roar reverberated through the heavens and earth.Emperor Shi Gu's expression changed drastically. His only thought at the moment was to escape. He was no longer at his peak, not even half-peak. The nine Thunderbolts had almost consumed all of his energy.At this moment, he felt the danger of death. With some unwillingness and despair, he roared,""Impossible! I'm a venerable sovereign! I'm a venerable sovereign!"He was a venerable sovereign!He admitted that he had been killed by Li Hao, but who was this woman?A dead man?I will be killed by the dead?How could an unknown woman, who was only famous in Silver Moon by relying on her status as Li Hao's fianc√©e, kill me?This can't be real!BOOM!The long sword slashed down!Emperor Shi Gu roared and his endless power burst out!"I will not die Here!"Bang! Bang! The long sword came down completely, and the firmament sword burst with boundless sword intent. The power of time froze the opponent for a moment, and the sword slashed down from head to tail, with a destructive power bursting out!BOOM!The bone corrosion Supreme Emperor exploded in an instant, and countless Red Moon Power overflowed and gathered as if he was about to be Reborn!Li Hao, however, raised his head to look at the sky and suddenly laughed. He reached out his hand, and the power of the Crimson Moon gathered and transformed into stars. At this moment, li daoheng's expression changed drastically!The tenth star was here!BOOM!In an instant, Li Hao was struck into ashes, and Li daoheng no longer cared about the celestial pole. Lightning descended, striking him and instantly destroying him. He was suddenly reborn and destroyed again. The Origin's calling bed appeared and was cut into pieces again!In the air, the endless power of the Crimson Moon was also covered by the lightning. In an instant, a scream was heard."No... Impossible ... I'm a venerable sovereign ..." He said.Boom! Boom! Boom!The void exploded, and the power of the Crimson Moon rapidly crumbled. At this moment, a great universe appeared between heaven and earth like a Crimson Moon. At this moment, someone seemed to have sensed something, and a faint voice resounded,""Bone erosion ... Primal Chaos lightning ... Dead ..."The illusory voice was faint across thousands of mountains and rivers. In an instant, the Crimson Moon universe disappeared.In the void, everything was turned into ashes!At this moment, there was only one half-dead man standing in the world. Celestial pole was also a little lost.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ In the distance, the cat was also looking at the sky in a daze, as if it had fallen into a daze.The venerable sovereign was dead, Li Hao was dead, li daoheng was dead, Zheng Yu was dead ...All of this was like a dream!Silver moon's strongest members had all died this time.The bone eroding Supreme Emperor, who had been sealed for 100000 years, had died in this catastrophe.Blood even started to rain from the sky.The last bit of hope seemed to have vanished into thin air with this rain of blood.The Heaven's Will ... Was also dead!Lin Hongyu stared blankly at the void without saying a word. Tiny cracks appeared on the long sword in her hand, and the aura of death spread throughout the entire world."You ... You don't like me that much?" Lin Hongyu mumbled to herself as she stared blankly at the shattered Void.Do you really not want to owe me a favor?I ... Am not your fianc√©e?You pulled me out of hell and you're leaving just like that?Li Hao ... Have you never had the slightest bit of humanity in you?You seem to ... Never want to owe anyone, anyone!

2485 Chapter 414
The lightning dissipated, and the world was destroyed.In just one day, all the experts were wiped out. The bone erosion Emperor, who had troubled Silvermoon for 100000 years, had also fallen in this small world.The primal Chaos lightning swept across, and all the experts fell, including venerable sovereigns. At this moment, the entire Silvermoon world was expanding crazily. No small world had lost four venerable sovereigns in one day like the Silvermoon.Furthermore, the primal Chaos lightning struck twice a day.Between heaven and earth, the clear air rose while the foul air fell.It was the scene of the beginning of the world!The rain of blood was still falling, but the world was beginning to split open. Not far away, the gray mountains spread, and the forbidden Sea was boiling.Countless beasts instantly gained intelligence.In the Cang mountains, some of the greater demons had instantly advanced, crossing the mountains and seas and entering the sun and moon.Towering trees appeared in an instant and rose from the ground. The monster plant had gained intelligence!The Silver Moon was also starting to give birth to monster plants.Heaven's will split into two in a day. The blood rain transformed into Dao and nourished all living things. The demon race began to appear. The demon beasts and demon plants were all evolving. As for the human race, there was no need to mention that the energy of heaven and earth was infinite. At this moment, even if they did not cultivate, there were people who were naturally enlightened.They had truly stepped into an era where everyone practiced martial arts!At this moment, some babies were also baptized by the heaven and earth. It was as if they were born from the will of the heaven and earth for the first time. The first awakening of the heaven and earth 21 years ago was far less violent than this.That year, Li Hao, the Queen of the West, and other top existences of the new era were born.And today, with the armor of the venerable sovereign, the armor of the Heaven's Will, and the primal Chaos lightning, the world of Silver Moon had been cleansed and upgraded. If a baby was born on this day, it would definitely be the darling of the era.A natural-born cultivator!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶However, the people were silent.There was no joy.Only the roars of wild beasts and the cries of babies could be heard in the entire world. Everyone else was at a loss, somewhat lost, and somewhat sorrowful.They didn't know what the situation was.However ... The Heaven's Will had turned into a rain of blood and destroyed everything. This made people speculate ... Perhaps, the Marquis and those powerful enemies ... Had fallen together!Li Hao was a devil and had killed countless people.He had walked out of Silver City and silver Moon to take revenge. He had killed his way out and never stopped.However, there were also people who were chivalrous. They traveled all over the world, serving justice, eliminating demons that caused chaos, and killing the decadent ruling class. Revenge was one of them, and serving justice was another. Promoting education for all, martial arts for all, enlightening the people, suppressing superpowers, and breaking the class system.Even though the time was short.However, the people of Silvermoon all received benefits from it.No matter how strong a powerhouse was, how dangerous the war was, whether it was a neo martial artist traitor or a neo martial artist's surplus, no one could surpass Li Hao's Ascension to the world. The world was at peace and prosperous!Four countries attacked, eight cities recovered, three major organizations, seven divine mountains ...

The people were no longer ignorant and knew what was good and what was bad. They knew what was good and what was bad. They also knew that Li Hao was indispensable for the peace in the world today. Even though Li Hao's chances of showing up were getting lesser and lesser, all the heroes in the world were under Li Hao's control!They were Lin Hongyu and Qian Wuliang, the ambitious men of the city of supers.The martial masters of Silvermoon province were unruly, like Sky sword and BA Dao.Neo martial aristocrats, such as Zhang an, Jiang Yingli ...These people were only able to get together and fight one side because of Li Hao. Otherwise, who could have easily unified Silver Moon?Today, everyone was in a daze.He had some understanding and some feelings.Some people were already terrified and uneasy.Li Hao was dead!With Li Hao's death, would the world ... Prosper or be in chaos?Who would suppress Zhang an and the other neo martial artists?Heaven's Fate, a peak half-Emperor, supported the Dali King. Who could suppress him?The Queen was a God of heaven and earth, a ruthless person who replaced the true Moon god. Who could deal with her?Who could subdue an ambitious expert like Qian Wuliang, who could see through people's hearts, control the void Dao universe, and reach the peak Heavenly King realm?Li Hao didn't seem to care, but Qian Wuliang was terrified and didn't dare to resist.At such a young age, he was unparalleled in his schemes, killed all the strong, and reversed the universe. Who would dare to be impudent?However, on this day ... Who could suppress them?The Stargate was sealed, and the new martial artists could not leave. If the Silver Moon world was a small world in the past, it was now more or less a medium-sized world. Even if it was not as good as the new martial artists, the entire world had countless opportunities and opportunities.At this moment, this world was no longer the Silvermoon world from before.Even venerable sovereigns would be tempted.The will of heaven had fallen, and no one could control the world ... There were two masters of the great Dao, would they fight each other?Countless thoughts appeared in everyone's mind.Many experts crossed the void and arrived from the central mainland.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The two masters of the great Dao had come, the Saints of new martial arts had come, the king of Dali had come, and the Queen who had recovered a little had come ...The Silver City had already turned into an ocean.No one believed that this was Li Hao's hometown. A few days ago, it had been a city, but today, it had completely turned into an ocean, and even the forbidden Sea was running through it.Hong Yitang took a step forward and looked at the sky. A red light appeared in his eyes as if he wanted to cry, but it disappeared in an instant. Silver Moon Men would not cry easily.Not far away, a Black dog's nose twitched as it sniffed at the familiar scent. It seemed to be sobbing.In the air, a half-dead man stood still, as if he had died.Hong Yitang's voice was like a great Bell,"senior Empyrean pole, may I ask if I, Marchioness Silvermoon, am alive or dead?"

Everyone was shocked!Was he alive or dead?Heaven's Fate was silent.Naturally, he was dead.The apocalyptic catastrophe, the instant extraction of his power, and the sacrifice of his life to resurrect Lin Hongyu ... It was already beyond anyone's expectations that Li Hao could kill the corrosion bone Emperor at the last moment.No one dared to believe that he could conquer the world with a single battle.Even though ... He was already dead.Celestial pole looked at Hong Yitang and sighed.""He's already dead ... He's a genius! This Li Hao ... I've only seen two or three people who can match him in my life!"It wasn't that no one could compare, but what kind of person was Heaven's Fate?He had experienced the beginning of martial arts, origin, neo martial arts, Silver Moon era, the celestial Emperor, nine emperors, Four Emperors, the gods of the beginning of martial arts, neo martial human King, and Supreme ...Countless heroes and venerable sovereigns were not worthy of his attention.As for Li Hao, he said that there were only two or three people who could stand shoulder to shoulder with him, and the neo martial artist King was one of them. It could be seen that throughout the long river of history, there was almost no one who could stand shoulder to shoulder with him!However, this answer was not satisfactory.In an instant, the world fell silent.The powerhouses 'faces were solemn, heavy, sorrowful ... They were wrapped in countless emotions.He was really dead!"Senior, may I ask if the entire Silvermoon world has been upgraded?" Qian Wuliang asked with a serious face.As soon as he said this, some people looked at him with anger.Why are you asking about this now?Heaven's Fate was silent for a while before nodding.""I advanced! In the chaosverse, a world can give birth to a venerable Emperor, and a venerable Emperor is the Lord of a world, which makes them a small world ... In truth, the Silver Moon didn't even count as a small world. It never had a venerable Emperor!" "A world that can give birth to many venerable sovereigns, such as three to five, or even seven to eight ... Can be considered a medium-level world.""And like new martial arts, a large number of venerable sovereigns are born, and above venerable sovereigns are born ... Existences like human King, Emperor Cang, and sun god are the true great worlds!"He looked at Silver Moon and then at the group before him.""The Silver Moon has even directly crossed over to the small world and is currently advancing to a medium level world! The Silver Moon world had given birth to a great Dao universe, so it definitely had more than one venerable sovereign! Now that chaos has fused with the Silver Moon and expanded it, the Silver Moon world has given birth to several venerable sovereigns ... It's only a matter of time!"Reaching the heavens in a single step!In fact, if it weren't for the fact that the battle this time was too intense and the lightning was too powerful, three venerable sovereigns, Li Hao, Li daoheng, and Zheng Yu, might have been born on this day. These three people could be considered to be from the Silvermoon world.Their ancestors might have come from the neo martial world, but they themselves were actually born in the Silvermoon world.

Although it was still not as good as neo martial ... This was originally an insignificant world born from the loss of some energy from neo martial. Now, it had officially separated from neo martial and could give birth to its own venerable sovereign.In fact, there was more than one!Hong Yitang glanced at Qian Wuliang from the corner of his eyes. At this moment, he suppressed all his emotions and looked at Lin Hongyu who didn't say a word as if she had really died.He looked around again ... Those new martial arts Saints and strong people were all a little confused.He knew that Li Hao's death had thrown his heart into chaos!He couldn't be bothered to be sad. At this moment, he only had one thought ... The Silver Moon belonged to Li Hao, and the reality Dao universe was his no matter who came to take it!That was because ... There were too many things contained within.Yuan Shuo, Liu Long, and hou Xiaochen ...These people that Li Hao cared about and cared about still had a chance to be resurrected, and this opportunity was in the real Dao universe.That day, when Li Hao transferred the great Dao universe to him, he repeatedly mentioned that the truth Dao universe was the only thing he truly cared about.Now, he was also at the sixth level of the Dao integration realm and had the combat power of a peak Heavenly King.However, in this world, there were still others who were stronger than him, such as the celestial pole and Zhang an ... That's right, that Zhang an who had always been inconspicuous had previously joined forces with King Dali to fight Zheng Yu, and his strength was not weak.There were also many new martial Saints!In addition to them, Qian Wuliang, who was about the same level as them, and the devouring Moon Goddess, the Queen who was a little weak but not weak in nature, were also there ...These people were all top-notch experts.Moreover, the Dao sword that had received some benefits from li daoheng had reached the fourth level of Dao integration, which was the level of a Heavenly King, even though it had been casually thrown out by li daoheng.These people would affect the entire Silver Moon.He had countless thoughts and could not be bothered to be sad. He suppressed his restlessness, all his anger, and all his despair, and his face was as calm as ever."Senior, the Silver Moon Marquis is the will of the heavens. Heaven and earth can not be destroyed, and time will pass. I think he can still return!""In this great Dao universe, there are still some of Lord Marquis's stars ... So, he can be resurrected, right?""From the past to the future, from ancient times until now, only the Marchioness Silvermoon has passed through the past and present. A mere lightning can kill him?"At this moment, Hong Yitang took a step forward and said with a calm expression,""Thus, I would like to call upon all of you to gather the true Dao, to be summoned by the people, to awaken Lord Marquis from death. Senior, do you think ... We can succeed?"Heaven's Fate's heart trembled as he glanced at him.These people in front of him ... He had to admit that they were somewhat out of his expectations.Li Hao's death might have saddened them, but they had kept it deep in their hearts. At this moment, they did not collapse. On the contrary, some of them who did not care about anything stood up as if they wanted to rally and prevent the Silver Moon from collapsing!

"That's right,"Qian Wuliang quickly added," if you need the help of Phantom path, I will do my best to revive the Marquis!" Even if I have to pay with my life, I will not hesitate. Senior, please give me some guidance!"On the other side, director Zhao suddenly said,"we still need to revive the Marquis!" Even if he had to pay a huge price! Everyone, although Silvermoon's experts have been killed ... The Silvermoon world has attracted two Thunder tribulations, which will certainly cause a big commotion. We may be within the scope of the Crimson Moon universe. If it's in neo martial, it's fine, but if it's in Crimson Moon ... One of the enemy's venerable sovereigns has died, and before that ... There's even a faint sound of the great Dao!"He looked around and said,'if the Marquis can't be resurrected ... Who here dares to say that they can fight against the red moon sovereign? Not to mention many, even if it's just one ... Who can fight against one?"He no longer kept a low profile and said in a sonorous tone,""Perhaps, there are people who have the chance to advance to the venerable sovereign realm, such as the earth overturning sword and gan Wuliang ... Even the Dali King and the Queen of the West, all of you have a chance. Ask yourselves, if the great beings of the Crimson Moon universe were to attack, can all of you ... Lead the people of Silvermoon to resist?"Director Zhao's voice was loud and clear."At this moment, we have to find an opportunity. We have to pay any price to resurrect the Marquis. Only then will there be hope. Under the Marquis's leadership, we can either find new martial arts or Silver Moon will become stronger!""Lord Marquis has always been fair in his work. Those who are capable will go up, and those who are incapable will go down! Whether it's general Ying or director Wang ... They all come from different powers and different eras ... But in Lord Marquis's eyes, they're all the same and have never been treated unfairly!"At this moment, director Zhao said sincerely,""I, the Silver Moon Martial Master, am like the Dao integration stage Tian Jian, the master of truth, earth-overturning sword, BA Dao, who is about to reach the Dao integration stage, me, old Zhou, who has reached the Dao integration stage, the five commanders of the demon-hunting Army, and Huang Yu, who is in charge of the military ... We all hope that the Marquis can be resurrected and return to Silver Moon, leading us to our peak again! Other than the Marquis, no one can represent me, Silver Moon!"His tone was calm, but the meaning behind his words made one's heart freeze.The Silver Moon Martial Master would kill whoever dared to seize power!There were many Silver Moon experts. Hong Yitang, who was at his peak, and director Zhao, director Zhou, who were at the Dao integration stage, were all quite powerful.At this moment, whether or not he could resurrect Li Hao ... He had to resurrect him!Even if ... There was no hope.Even if it was just for show.He had to stabilize the Silver Moon. During this time, he had to find a way to stabilize the entire Silver Moon world.Director Zhao quickly looked at Lin Hongyu in the air and his eyes flickered,""Although the Marquis has disappeared for a short time, the lady is still here. She killed a venerable sovereign and red Moon bone erosion venerable with one sword strike. At this moment, Madam, please take control of the world and lead all the forces to find a way to resurrect the Marquis!"Director Zhao's voice was like the heavens shaking,""Madam, please pull yourself together. The Marquis who controls time can revive Madam from hell, so he can definitely walk out on his own!"Lin Hongyu had killed a venerable sovereign at the last moment! Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ And now, she was holding the firmament sword. The firmament sword that had devoured the eight divine weapons was still exuding a strong aura of death. However, they knew that Lin Hongyu was still alive.They even wondered if Li Hao had asked Lin Hongyu to kill a venerable sovereign at the last moment just for this moment.With Li Hao's personality, he would definitely have some backup plans.For example, Lin Hongyu ... She might be the only person who could fight against a pseudo-Emperor, and she might even be able to fight against the celestial pole ...  Li Hao didn't care about what would happen after his death, but he certainly didn't want the universe of the great path to be taken away. His family, his teacher, his friends, and his hope were still there.At that moment, the Silver Moon martial masters all looked at Lin Hongyu.At this moment, not far away, the Redwood also transformed into a human form. With a thought, it said,""Lord Marquis will definitely return. Just as director Zhao said, at this moment, Madam, please control the world. The world is changing, and people are panicking ... Our Yao plant Army will definitely carry out Lord Marquis's orders and follow Madam's orders!"The Yao plant Army was also an extremely powerful force.With the expansion of heaven and earth this time, there would definitely be people who would advance. And among the monster plant Army, there were many undying and Paragon cultivators. Perhaps, there would be many Dao integration Saints soon.In the air, Lin Hongyu seemed to have just woken up.He turned his head and looked at the others. The death in his eyes made people's hearts tremble. Even Qian Wuliang was slightly shocked and confused."Is Lin Hongyu ... Dead?"This was the first reason!Second, what was her current strength?Third, where was her Dao?Her Natal star seemed to have been taken away previously and then merged into her body. What was this?Was it an existence that was separated from the great Dao, or was there another world?For a moment, everyone couldn't see through her. Although her last strike had killed a venerable sovereign, everyone knew that the bone erosion venerable sovereign was even weaker than an ordinary half-step sovereign at that time.Could Lin Hongyu still make such a move?In addition ... Whether Li Hao could be resurrected or not was also something everyone was concerned about. Without confirming this, no matter how ambitious a person was ... Unless he thought he was stronger and more intelligent than li daoheng, Zheng Yu, and Shi Gu, he should just wash up and go to sleep.Li Hao could even deal with them, let alone him.Qian Wuliang didn't say anything.He was ambitious.However, his ambition ... Was actually very clear.

2488 Chapter 414
If Li Hao was really dead, these people in front of him would not be able to suppress him. He did not want to risk his life for these people either. It was not worth it!However, if Li Hao still had a chance of being resurrected, even if his strength was greatly reduced, even if he became a master of void Dao ... He would not dare to oppose Li Hao. From the very beginning, he had not dared to oppose Li Hao, even if Li Hao made a difficult request.Last time, Li Hao had let him Enter the Void Dao universe, and then he had become the master of void Dao ... Qian Wuliang even suspected that this was actually Li Hao's goal. Whether Zheng Yu or li daoheng was in charge, there was not much difference in Li Hao's eyes.The two of them, including Li Hao, would definitely have a fight!In the end, with their personalities ... It might be normal for them to help Qian Wuliang and disgust Li Hao. In this way, becoming the master of Phantom path might even be in Li Hao's plan.Otherwise, Li Hao actually did not care about him entering the void Dao universe and did not even give him any missions ... Was it possible for him to forget about this matter?'That person ... If he doesn't squeeze you dry of your last bit of value, will he let you be free?Therefore, Qian Wuliang wasn't as ambitious as everyone had imagined, who couldn't wait to control the world ... Not to mention that he wasn't strong enough yet, the celestial pole, Zhang an, the king of Dali, and the Queen were all giving Li Hao face. Who was Qian Wuliang?If he dared to stand out and replace Li Hao ... The world would instantly fall into chaos. The powerhouses from the celestial pole who didn't care about anything might also attack him to give Li Hao face. He wasn't an idiot, so he wouldn't have any other thoughts at this moment.Lin Hongyu's gaze swept across the crowd, her eyes full of death."Resurrection?"She looked at the powerhouses and finally looked at the celestial pole.""At the last moment, time stopped and the will of the heavens shattered. Life force surged into my body ... He was almost completely annihilated. Senior, do you think that I still have a chance?"Celestial pole looked at her and said after a long while,""I'm not sure about that ... I know almost nothing about the new Dao, and it's the same for time!"At this point, he added,"also ... I don't want to get involved in Silver moon's matter, and it has little to do with me!" My main body is still in new martial arts, and my goal in Silver Moon is to resurrect the two cats. Now that they've been resurrected ... I only have one thought right now. If I can open a Stargate and leave through it, I'll return to new martial!""If we can't open the Stargate ..."He paused for a moment before continuing."Then we'll wait. Emperor Cang already knows that second cat has been resurrected, and my original body should also sense it ... If silver Moon is not far from new martial, perhaps my original body will come back very soon and open a Stargate from the outside to take me and second cat away!"As soon as these words came out, everyone's hearts settled.He continued,"also, if Beiwu wants to make the Li Dynasty stronger ... It has nothing to do with me. The Li Dynasty is actually passed down by the descendants of the fist God. The fist God was one of the strongest people in the beginning stage of martial arts. For the sake of the inheritance of the beginning stage, he fought with the human King and died in the end. The human King never hated them. Instead, he admired those gods of the beginning stage. They fought for the sake of the inheritance, for the race, and for the era ... So, he didn't destroy their inheritance!""Back then, I only came to the Li Dynasty to rest and find a place to stay. Later, the descendant of the fist God knew that I came to resurrect two cats ... After the Stargate was closed, he had other thoughts and was killed by me, turning into the bone of the forbidden Sea ... That was the ancestor of Beiwu, who was absorbed by himself ..." On the side, the king of Dali was stunned and looked at him in a daze."What are you looking at me for? "Heaven's Fate asked calmly. That's the truth ... So, I wasn't the first generation of Dali's God of beginner martial arts. Of course, the one who later impersonated the sun god was me!"No one expected that it would involve a past event.In the distance, Zhang an was slightly stunned.""But ... The Li Dynasty had used the name of celestial ruler BA a long time ago. He was the first God of beginner martial arts, the descendant of the God of fist. How dare he impersonate celestial ruler BA ..."Celestial pole laughed and said,"that's normal!" Actually ... It's not wrong, right? Back when celestial ruler BA Tian wiped out Chu Wu, fist God was considered half his teacher and had given him a lot of guidance. In order to preserve the heritage of Chu Wu, his descendants pulled the Tiger's skin off and celestial ruler BA Tian died completely. Venerable Emperor tie had a kind personality, so why would he look for him for this? If he dares to impersonate the sun god, then that's true skill!"In other words, the other party only dared to impersonate celestial ruler BA. He was dead, and the successor of celestial ruler BA was Supreme Emperor tie, who was also an iron dumbass ... In short, he would not care about these things.The sun god was still alive, and the one who pretended to be the sun god was a real man!Of course, the prerequisite was that the Stargate had to be sealed. Otherwise ... Not even the celestial pole would dare to do so. Not to mention him, even his father, the West Emperor, would not dare to do so.As for the future ... At most, he could just say that he had done it to attract sun God's attention, hoping that he would find Silver Moon ... What else could sun god say?At this moment, the celestial pole had quickly broken away from its relationship with the king of Dali.Whether you want to fight for power or not ... You can settle it yourself.To be honest, he didn't want to be involved in this.Even if this place advanced and became a medium-level world, it had nothing to do with him. So what if a few venerable sovereigns were born ... I'm a venerable sovereign myself, not the weakest venerable sovereign. Plus, I have a reputation in neo martial, so I'm too lazy to compete with these people here.And ... He wasn't sure if Li Hao could be resurrected.Li Hao was young, but he had many tricks up his sleeve.

Li Hao was not the first or the last one to do this. Many overlords in history ... Did this.

2489 Chapter 414
The king of Dali was speechless. I'm absorbing my ancestor?My old ancestor was killed by this person?'I ...''Well, actually, I don't have any feelings for him. It's been 100000 years. What does it have to do with me? I don't feel anything when I say that he's an old ancestor. It's been 100000 years. If the entire Li Dynasty is considered his descendant, then the Li Dynasty has been fighting internally for the past few years ... And it's like a family killing a family.'He was just a little speechless that the patriarch from 100000 years ago had been killed by this person, but he didn't think it was a big deal.Heaven's Fate's words had clearly expressed their attitude.As the world's number one expert so far ... He should be able to say that. If he didn't care about this, it would be much easier for everyone. Otherwise, once the celestial pole had the intention, who could match him?His strength might not be as strong as a venerable sovereign, but he could kill ordinary half-step sovereigns with one strike.Zheng Yu and Li daoheng weren't ordinary half-step sovereigns. They were truly close to being venerable sovereigns, which made the celestial pole seem slightly weaker.It was evident that Red Moon bone erosion Thearch's clone was easily killed by him when he was injured.Lin Hongyu's eyes flickered as she looked at the crowd."In that case ... No one has any objections. We'll all be focused on resurrecting the Marquis, even if ... We have to pay an extremely huge price, or even ... The great Dao universe, no one has any objections?"Qian Wuliang saw her and said in a hurry,""This is a void Dao universe that I obtained by luck. If Madam needs it and it is beneficial for Lord Marquis 'resurrection, you can take it away at any time!"Hong Yitang looked at her and was silent for a while before he said,""I don't mind resurrecting him ... But it can only be used for his resurrection. There are still many things in the truth Dao universe that can't be given up at will! You should understand!"Lin Hongyu glanced at him and nodded. She knew.It was very clear!The stars that might or might not exist belonged to Yuan Shuo and the others.All of this was more important than Li Hao's own resurrection.Can Li Hao be resurrected?She did not know!However, she knew that there was still hope. At the last moment, Li Hao had infused his remaining life force and the weak power of time into her body.That's right, the entire world seemed to have lost the power of time.Without the power of time, how could he revive Li Hao?However, there was a tiny bit of time power in her body that Li Hao had left in order to reverse and resurrect her. Even the chaotic lightning could not destroy it.At this moment, she was thinking ... Was Li Hao doing this on purpose or on purpose?Vitality, time power, death power ... Life and death, time!All of this was related to resurrection.In addition, at the last moment, Li Hao had grabbed a lot of energy, including the last trace of energy left by bone erosion Emperor. He had taken it and turned it into stars to perfect his 360 star great Dao.By then, would it still be meaningful for Li Hao to perfect the 360 stars great Dao?In the end, it was also destroyed! But at the last moment, it seemed like he had succeeded.What did this mean?She looked at the sky and the earth. Lin Hongyu was filled with mixed feelings."You ... Are you placing all your hopes on me?"Then why didn't he say it?Why do you want me to guess?Life and death, time, heaven and earth, the great Dao, 360 stars ... All of these seemed to have happened unintentionally. However, all of these seemed to be telling him that there was still hope. However, this hope was something only he knew.If you hide it ... With your reputation of killing a venerable sovereign and my fianc√É¬©e, you will be the only one who can rule Silver Moon. Everyone will support you!"Li Hao ... You despicable man!"‚Äã Lin Hongyu mumbled in her heart.Shameless!Are you testing me?Are you testing me with your life?At this moment, she had already understood, understood many things. There was still hope for Li Hao to be resurrected. It was just that he had left this outcome to her.If you want to be resurrected, then do your best."I didn't expect that the last bit of time power between heaven and earth would be in your body. Whether you were destroyed or something else, no one would know if you didn't resurrect or speak of it!The Silvermoon world is yours.This shameless villain actually wanted to test the human heart at the last moment of his life ... It was too outrageous, too heartless!Yes, it was ruthless!At that moment, Lin Hongyu finally realized what was going on. When these people all recommended her to rule the world, when they all told her that she could replace Li Hao, when they all placed their hopes of resurrecting Li Hao on her ...She finally understood!Li Hao still had a chance.And this opportunity, only I know, only I can do it.Bastard!"Also, the reason why this last bit of time power wasn't destroyed ... Even the primal Chaos lightning didn't notice it was because ... At that time, I was exuding a strong aura of death, so I was also a dead person. Why would the lightning care about a dead person?The aura of death covered the traces of time power.If all of this had been planned by Li Hao at that moment, Lin Hongyu could only say that this bastard was so clear-headed that he didn't even seem human at the last moment!He was not afraid of death. He was even playing hide-and-seek with the primal Chaos lightning. He was also testing people's hearts as if life and death were child's play.
