Black Panther seemed to be thinking. After a while, he nodded: "Alright, I didn't expect to trouble a rank seven direct descendant ... But that's right, it's indeed a big deal.""Please wait a moment, my Lord ..."The other party seemed to have gone out to inform them.At this moment, Li Hao looked at Kong Ji.""You should hide in the Silver Moon first. You and the Black Panther are not of the same origin. If you come into contact with them at close range, be careful not to be detected."Kong Ji didn't say much and quickly disappeared.……After waiting for a while, a golden-haired girl in human form appeared."Fellow Daoist, I've been waiting for a long time!"As soon as the other party appeared, she sized up the Black Panther and revealed a sweet smile."Greetings, Phoenix Flame Thearch!" Li Hao quickly replied."Greetings!"The other party was polite and smiled.""I heard that fellow Daoist needs a rank six world with the best water system. Would you like to use it for yourself, or ...""I'll use it for myself. I've been at the fifth step for some years, and to reach the sixth step ... It's too difficult! I've been nurturing a rank 5 world for all these years, but it's too hard for a world to advance. I need a rank 6 world, and water is the best because I'm skilled in the Dao of water. If I devour it, I might be able to advance it to rank 6 ...""I see!"Princess Fire Phoenix understood and nodded,""A rank 6 world is rare, and it's even rarer to see a Water-type world! Also, the price is not cheap ...""Is the price very high?""Very high!"The fire Phoenix Princess nodded."Currently, there are records of transactions in a Level-6 world in Fire Phoenix City. A Level-6 world, of course, is definitely not a great world. The normal price, if converted to pure great Dao crystals, is about two billion great Dao crystals.""So expensive?"Li Hao pretended to be surprised, but in fact, he was quite surprised. It was so expensive.It was not a sixth-tier world with a great cosmos. It was just an ordinary sixth-tier world. Although he had spent billions or even tens of billions, an ordinary sixth-tier venerable sovereign would only consume a few billion great Dao crystals to cultivate to the sixth-tier from scratch.A rank six empty world did not mean that a rank six venerable sovereign had the hope of advancing to the next rank. It was still a rank five peak to rank six."Yes, and this is the lowest price ..." The fire Phoenix Princess continued,"if it's not a great Dao crystal, then we'll have to see what kind of treasure you can provide. To the strong, Dao accumulation crystals, great Dao crystals, and worlds are all necessities. If you have a monarch weapon, you can also trade for a powerful monarch weapon ... Or the corpse of a strong cultivator, a top-tier venerable sovereign technique, and so on. However, they're all rare and exquisite.""Fellow Daoist, are you very confident that you can advance to the sixth step?" she suddenly smiled. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao's heart skipped a beat."I'm confident, but not very confident. It all depends on luck. Why do you ask?""If you're very confident but can't afford to pay this great Dao crystal ... You can consider joining my Fire Phoenix World!""Yes!" Princess Feng Yan was also very direct."The fire Phoenix realm will also recruit a group of strong cultivators, but ... We'll pay a huge price. I might need you to pay something as well!""For example, the level six world you need ... Is worth as much as two billion great Dao crystals. You can prepare half yourself, and my fire wind world can pay the other half. According to your strength, you can condense about 10000 great Dao crystals every year by yourself! 1 billion is 100000 years ...""And if you wish for my Fire Phoenix realm to pay for half, you will need to sign a 10000-year great Dao agreement with the fire Phoenix realm. You will only need to serve my realm for 10000 years, saving 90000 years!""Moreover, if you are injured during your service, or if you go out to battle, you will receive other subsidies. If you successfully enter level six, you will also receive additional benefits. Even ... If our world can seize some Level Seven Worlds, we can also give priority to experts with outstanding contributions!"“……”Li Hao was very shocked. This guy wanted to recruit him right off the bat. He only needed to serve him for 10000 years. Of course, the premise was that he had to pay half of the resources. As for the other half ... The other party might just say something. Whether they had it themselves or outsiders came to trade, they might sell it to the fire Phoenix Sector for one billion great Dao crystals.It was equivalent to letting a fifth-rank or even sixth-rank venerable sovereign serve the fire Phoenix Sector for ten thousand years without spending a single cent. More importantly, they even signed a great Dao agreement ... This was ruthless. Li Hao knew very well how the four major worlds were killed back then!You can't just randomly sign this thing. The chaos lightning tribulation is really striking you!Of course, Li Hao was used to being mocked, so he didn't mind it too much.Not to mention a level-six lightning tribulation, he had even survived a level-seven lightning tribulation ... Speaking of which, this was a good thing. Li Hao's mind suddenly wandered. That's right. If I randomly sign a great Dao agreement with someone and the lightning strikes me, will it ... Not kill me, but allow me to comprehend the power of lightning?At this moment, he suddenly had many thoughts. The princess of the fire Phoenix realm had actually appeared of her own accord. Did she come out to meet people so easily?A fifth rank Supreme Emperor was not weak, but there was no need for a peak sixth rank Supreme Emperor to show up personally. Were there no other sixth rank Supreme emperors in the fire Phoenix realm?Many thoughts appeared in his mind."There's also the agreement of the great Dao, which will last for ten thousand years ... All of this might be a test. More importantly, I'm not afraid of the chaos lightning tribulation!So what if he betrayed the agreement?"This ... This ... I don't have half of the resources. I ... I've served the fire Phoenix Sector for 20000 years. Can I exchange it for a Tier 6 world?"

Chapter 3171 Let's Sign The Contract (1)_7
At this moment, Li Hao said, if it doesn't work ... I can ... Wait 30000 years! At most, thirty thousand years ... I can sign a great Dao agreement with the fire Phoenix realm. If I go against it, if I go against the great Dao agreement during that period, I can ... I can withstand a fifth-stage chaos lightning tribulation ..."Even Princess Fire Phoenix was stunned. This fellow ... Was most likely not the heavenly Hound.Of course, this fellow was also trying to gain something for nothing. Fifth stage Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?Would that kill you?"I'm sorry," Princess Fire Phoenix laughed."The agreement signed by our realm is based on the seventh-grade lightning tribulation!"Even if you're a heavenly dog, do you dare to sign the seventh-grade lightning tribulation?Betraying, I'll kill you!He then added,"moreover, fellow Daoist, you ... You completely need our realm to provide you with a rank six world. To be honest, there are many rank five venerable sovereigns like you. We still need to assess them, including their strength, great Dao, and so on. Then, we will let the Daoist master decide if we should recruit them."Seventh-rank? Li Hao cursed in his heart.Even a seventh level venerable sovereign would have a headache if he were to encounter a seventh level lightning tribulation. For the sake of a sixth level world, once a contract was signed, even a seventh level venerable sovereign would have to complain incessantly. If a fifth level venerable sovereign dared to betray him, he would only be met with death!Of course, if this thing was willing, the other party would not force it. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to sign an agreement against one's will.In addition, there was a price to pay for signing a great Dao agreement. Unless it was worth it, the signing of the agreement would involve the participation of the chaos lightning tribulation. It was sometimes a big problem, and ordinary macro worlds were not willing to provoke it.The Black Panther seemed to be struggling and conflicted. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Seventh grade lightning tribulation!It had been effective for tens of thousands of years.Was it worth it to exchange for a rank six world?After a long time, Li Hao said,"of course, I won't sign an agreement just to betray you. It doesn't matter if you're at the fifth or seventh rank. It doesn't matter!" However, I'm a rank five venerable sovereign. Even a rank six world might not be able to help me advance successfully ... How about this, if we agree to the great Dao Alliance, you guys will have to bear all the resources for me to advance to rank six ... Otherwise, both of us will go back on our agreement and suffer the rank seven chaos lightning tribulation together. In that case, I'm worth a try ... Otherwise, forget it!""This ... Fellow Daoist, you're making things difficult for me. After all, every member of the chaos race is in a different situation. It's not impossible for them to be unable to advance ..."The fire Phoenix Princess shook her head. Although it was not a bad idea to recruit a rank five venerable sovereign, she was not stupid enough to agree to such a condition.In addition, she also knew a little about the situation on Red moon's side. She had been screwed because she had signed the agreement randomly.Li Hao pondered for a moment and probed,"then ... Then how about this? you don't have to face the seventh-stage lightning tribulation. However, if I really join the fire Phoenix Sector, can you give me a piece of territory in the Dragon field?" It'll be best if it has absolute control over the surrounding small and medium-sized worlds. Of course, I won't intentionally devour them, but I might have them offer some great Dao crystals ...""When the fire Phoenix realm needs me, I'll be at your service at any time ... Otherwise, I'll have to go to the Dragon Realm to try my luck. Perhaps the Dragon Realm will have the confidence to agree. I'm a fifth rank venerable sovereign. Although I'm not as good as a seventh rank, if I can reach the sixth rank, I'll be qualified to have a place in the chaos ..."At this moment, Li Hao had many thoughts. The great Dao Alliance was a good thing!"I can sign it. If this place can really provide me with a piece of land to rule over hundreds of worlds ... That would be great!Princess Fire Phoenix quickly fell into deep thought. Was it worth it?Actually, it was nothing.Powerful worlds had some control over weaker worlds. In the Dragon Realm, the dragon world dominated the entire chaos. As for the rank seven great worlds, they had their own sphere of influence. Within their sphere of influence, those worlds had to offer Tributes.This was very normal!However ... The other party was only a fifth level venerable sovereign. It was impossible for him to want a large territory."How big do you think you need?""It would be best if it could cover thousands of worlds!"“……”Princess Fire Phoenix felt that this fellow was overestimating itself. It had no self-awareness and was extremely greedy. After a while, she laughed."Within the coverage of my Fire Phoenix Sector, there are 626 worlds that have been detected so far. There are only 68 middle-level worlds, and the rest are low-level worlds ..."Li Hao's expression instantly turned grave, not for any other reason, but because the other party really knew all the worlds within his jurisdiction like the back of his hand.This was too terrifying!None of the three regions could do it."So little?"Li Hao asked.The other party was speechless.There were more than a dozen macro worlds in the entire Dragon field. Except for the human Thunder World, the other cotton plants could cover hundreds of worlds. There were more than ten thousand worlds in the entire Dragon field!In fact, there weren't that many. The worlds that the demons covered were few, and the fire Phoenix World was considered many.Even so, there were only a few thousand worlds in the entire Dragon field, most of which were small worlds and some unrated worlds. This guy opened his mouth and said there were thousands of them. Did he not know how to count?However, the fact that the other party dared to sign the grade 7 lightning tribulation agreement was worth heaving a sigh of relief.Princess Fire Phoenix was still thinking about this, so Li Hao settled for the next best thing."Then ... Then I want the territory of 100 worlds ... Of course, the requirements may be a little high, but in the fire Phoenix realm, if I don't enter the great Dao universe, I can't cultivate. The native experts of your Fire Phoenix realm don't need the world's offerings, only the outsiders do. If there aren't many outsiders in the fire Phoenix realm, I think ... If I can get this, it's worth signing the great Dao Alliance and sending the seventh-level lightning tribulation ..."

Chapter 3172 Let's Sign The Contract (8)
"This ... I can't make the decision. If fellow Daoist is really interested, you can stay here for a few days. I will inform Dao master and if we can talk, we can talk in detail!"This, she indeed had no way of making the decision. It was just territory, not directly given to the world. Even if the territory was given, it would still belong to the fire Phoenix realm. It was equivalent to appointing a commander.Princess Fire Phoenix did not expect it to go so smoothly. However, the price was not low. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  There was a rank 6 world and a decent piece of land.Territory was a matter of agreement. Moreover, the Dragon Realm was the dragon world's territory. No matter what this man did, he wouldn't dare to plunder or devour a world. That would be courting death!If they offered too much, they wouldn't be too happy.At this moment, she fell into deep thought.If a level five venerable Emperor could enter level six ... It was rare for a level six venerable Emperor to be willing to sign a 30000-year contract without entering the great path universe.Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for a rank six to join a rank seven world, because it was impossible to become a rank seven venerable sovereign. However, it was possible to join a rank eight world.In a rank 7 world, the limit was rank 5.Only rank five venerable sovereigns had a chance of advancing to rank six.The thought emerged in his mind for a while. Over the years, the fire Phoenix realm had also recruited many foreign venerable sovereigns, but there were not many fifth-level ones. There were only four or five, and they had all paid a great price.There were some native ones, and there were even quite a few Grade 6 ones.However, most of them were experts from the inferno Phoenix Clan. Outsiders had little hope of entering the great Dao universe.He had paid a huge price to recruit those Grade 5 experts, but unfortunately, none of them had reached Grade 6.At this moment, she was thinking about this and suddenly said,""I'm sorry, I forgot to ask. What's fellow Daoist's name?""Black Dog!"“……”Vulgar!Princess Fire Phoenix secretly looked down on him. He was really direct.The chaos beasts from the outside world were indeed uncouth. The Dragon Master had been promoting the culture of the Dragon race all these years. Now, the chaos beasts living in the Dragon field were much more cultured than those from the outside world. However, this was not important."Then, fellow Daoist Black Dog, please stay here for a while. I'll come back to see you once I have an answer.""Alright!"Li Hao agreed readily. At this moment, he was also a little excited. A level 6 world was nothing, but the key was ... Territory!If I can really get a piece of land ... I'm sorry, this piece of land will soon become a place for me to rear fish, rear my little realm!At that time, I will truly be rich.However, I'll have to be careful. It'll be best if I can make an agreement in the Grand Dao agreement that no one can enter my territory without my permission.At this moment, Li Hao was also thinking about all this.He suddenly felt that the fire Phoenix Jie might be a great opportunity.Everyone was afraid of the great Dao agreement, but he was not. This might be his greatest opportunity. Although the rank seven lightning tribulation was powerful, it should not be too difficult for him, Kong Ji, and ER Mao to pass it.At this moment, Li Hao was already prepared to turn his back on them. Of course, he couldn't really serve them for 30000 years.After the princess disappeared, Li Hao's telepathic message was empty, and he smiled.""I might have to stay in the fire Phoenix Sector for a while. It's easy to deal with cultured beasts of primordial chaos. The more I think, the more I might be able to adapt!"If he only relied on his fists and didn't think about anything else, it would be troublesome.Kong Ji didn't say a word. He only shook his head slightly. This fire Phoenix Jie ... Was really daring!If they really recruited Li Hao, their base might be destroyed.Princess Fire Phoenix seemed to be smart, but why was it so easy to fool her?Of course, if it were him ... Putting himself in his shoes, the Son of God of light taking in a rank five and even signing a great Dao agreement ... It seemed like there was nothing to be afraid of?A rank seven Primal Chaos lightning tribulation? are you looking for death?Even a rank seven master would be afraid of this thing!At this moment, he mourned for the fire Phoenix realm. If they really gave him the territory, the hundreds of small realms might all become Li Hao 's. It all depended on whether he would give it to them or not.

3173 Chapter 518
Fire Phoenix Pavilion.The other party had arranged a huge courtyard for Li Hao. It had all kinds of pavilions and even looked like an internal space.A fifth rank venerable sovereign was worth it.Although the fifth-rank was not an Overlord, it was the sixth-rank next. Most of the sixth-rank experts were busy fighting for the seventh-rank, and the seventh-rank experts would not easily participate in the battle. Therefore, the fifth-rank experts were the top group of experts at the chaos actual combat level.He was also known as the vanguard general of venerable sovereign Xuanji.A little stronger and he would be at the peak of power in the decisive battle below the great world. It was just right that he was neither too strong nor too weak.At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about the environment. He just looked around ... And frowned again. A group of Beasts of Chaos was known for their chaos, but the place they were living in now was decorated with flowers and flowers, with a small bridge and flowing water.This did not match the status of a Chaos Beast.He didn't look at it again. At this moment, the Black Panther, who was a Chaos Beast, didn't care about these places. It just cultivated silently, circulated its cultivation technique, and absorbed the power of the great Dao around it.The power of the great Dao here was extremely rich.As Black Panther began to cultivate, he circulated the five birds secret technique. The power of the five elements poured in madly, with water as the main element. Black Panther's Foundation was actually the ninth refinement force, which originated from Liu Long, so his main element was water.The secondary cultivation of the secret skill of five birds would devour the power of all five elements.Li Hao didn't know if anyone was still watching him, but he didn't care. In the chaos, cultivating the power of the five elements was the most common way of cultivation. Silver moon's Secret technique of five birds was almost unknown.His teacher was too weak and didn't have a chance to show it.Li Hao had once displayed the power of the five elements, but it was only ordinary. What made people remember him was his swordsmanship and the short time that no one knew about.The five elements were too common.……The city in the sky.Princess Fire Phoenix had returned.His mother was busy with other things to deal with the Thunder realm, a rank seven major world and the only human major world in the Dragon field.Taking in a rank five venerable sovereign was not something his mother needed to worry about.Even if the other party was the heavenly Hound, that tier six neo martial was not worth mother's worry.The fire Phoenix Princess could make the decision herself. This was something that she had only perfunctorily said to Li Hao previously, saying that she would report to him.However, he was still young, so he thought about it again and again ...Princess Fire Phoenix walked towards another huge Palace in the city in the sky. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  After a while, she arrived at the gate of the mansion.The enormous gate was resplendent and even more resplendent than the palace of the fire Phoenix ... And this place was where the experts of the Dragon race were stationed in the fire Phoenix realm.Outsiders only knew that the fire Phoenix Jie had experts from the Dragon race guarding it. It was said that they were helping the fire Phoenix Jie suppress foreign enemies and prevent the open fire Phoenix Jie from being attacked. However, outsiders didn't know that in reality, there was a top-tier dragon race powerhouse overseeing this place."Feng Yan requests an audience with the venerable one!""Enter."Flowers bloomed under his feet, and golden light flickered in front of him.Feng Yan stepped in.Soon, they entered the main hall. In the hall, an old man whose aura could not be detected was pouring tea and drinking by himself. When he saw Feng Yan enter, he smiled and said,""In some large human worlds, experts don't like to drink alcohol or blood. They like to drink tea. It's often said that we, the chaos race, and the fey race, drink raw meat and blood and are classified as beasts!""When the Dragon Lord heard these words in his early years, he was extremely furious. He drank blood to strengthen himself, replenish his vitality, strengthen his body, and strengthen his qi and blood ... This is the survival of the fittest, the way of survival for the chaos race!""However, when the Dragon Lord reaches level eight and rules the Dragon field, the human race has some habits that we can learn. As the saying goes, know yourself and know your enemy, and you'll be victorious in every battle. There are countless chaotic realms, and the human race is the dominant race. Be it square domain or outer domain, the human race has the advantage ... Why?"Feng Yan was used to the old man's actions. This old man almost never revealed his true form in the fire Phoenix realm. He appeared in his human form all year round and learned everything from the human race. He learned how to eat, drink tea, play chess, dress, and plant flowers ...It wasn't just this one. It was said that some of the top existences in the dragon world also had such a habit, which they had learned from the Dragon Lord.Humans stood proudly in the world.To dominate the chaos!The individually powerful chaos beasts were suppressed by the human race. They lived in a corner and wandered the chaos with no one to rely on. The Dragon Master entered the human race and learned the strong points of the human race, determined to reform the chaos race.And today, he had already seen the results.The fire Phoenix realm was also deeply affected."Great senior!"Feng Yan didn't say much and went straight to the point.""Will the Dragon field participate in the battle of new martial arts?""You want to join the battle?" the old man laughed. "My Inferno Phoenix Clan will naturally follow the Dragon Lord's wishes!"The old man smiled again and nodded."The inferno Phoenix tribe is the Dragon tribe's strongest ally. If anyone asks, I will only say,'it depends on the timing!'" Since you're asking, then ... We must fight!"He had to fight!Feng Yan was a little excited, and he quickly said,""In that case, we'll need to recruit soldiers and buy horses to gather the forces from all four sides?""The key lies in the advanced venerable sovereigns. That's the key to victory ... Of course, the other venerable sovereigns should be recruited if they can.""I want to recruit a fifth-rank venerable sovereign from the outer region. Grandmaster, do you think it's worth it to pay a sixth-rank world and guard the hundred realms alone?"The old man smiled,"if you think it's worth it, then it is!" However ... It's not worth it for an ordinary fifth rank venerable sovereign. If he's stronger, it'll be worth it. It depends on his strength and whether his Dao has the hope of reaching the seventh rank ..."In his eyes, this was just a small matter.

The fire Phoenix realm was also a Grade 7 realm, so these small matters were not worth mentioning.Princess Feng Yan even came to ask him in person ... He didn't know if she was here to show her respect to the dragon clan or if she had other intentions."I'm worried that ... The other party might be transformed from a new martial heavenly dog!"Feng Yan spoke the truth."Otherwise, I can recruit a fifth rank venerable sovereign myself." Now, mother has gone to deal with the matters of the Thunder World. I want to sign a great Dao agreement with the other party, but I thought of how the Crimson Moon world was severely injured because of the great Dao agreement ... I'm worried that I'm too young and not comprehensive enough, so ... I hope that Grandmaster can come and bear witness to the signing of the agreement. "So that was how it was!"A Dog Race cultivator?""Yes."So that was the case. The old man understood now. He had not been keeping an eye on them recently, so he knew the situation. He laughed when he heard this and said,""You're probably thinking too much. It's said that the new martial arts sky dog appeared in the chiyang region a few days ago. That dog was very arrogant. It swallowed a rank six world in one gulp, killed many venerable sovereigns, and clamored for a rank seven master. In the end, its tail was broken by a rank seven master, and it fled in a sorry state ... It should still be recuperating in the new martial arts world now."Feng Yan was speechless!"Challenging a tier 7?""Yes,"Feng Yan was also a sixth rank venerable sovereign, so he knew how strong a seventh rank venerable sovereign was. He was a little confused."Grandmaster, on the side of neo martial arts, the Swordmaster, the heavenly Hound, these powerhouses can fight six against seven! What is it for?"He didn't really understand.Our Fire Phoenix realm is also very strong, and she's considered one of the top tier level six experts in the fire Phoenix realm. However, to be honest, she doesn't have any confidence in killing Level Seven experts.However, there was more than one new martial artist.,m "Neo martial ... The yin-yang world is different."The old man thought for a moment."I don't know the specific reason. I only know that ... Neo martial might have been a level nine world ... Of course, I've only vaguely heard the Dragon Master mention it once.""Ninth-rank?""Not really ... It's hard to say, Dragon Master. I've only seen and heard some things in tianfang. According to Dragon Master, the neo martial world may have existed a few years ago, or even a million years ago. It gave birth to living creatures that were extremely powerful. They once entered tianfang and had contact with tianfang experts ...""But in some of the information from the new martial artists, the other party said that their world has only been born for about a hundred thousand years ..." The old man sighed.The guy from neo martial either didn't know or said it on purpose.A million years ago, someone had walked out of the other party's world and had come into contact with the experts of the heaven's side, even the master of the heaven's side ...How could it have only been born a hundred thousand years ago?Therefore, he was not surprised that neo martial had such signs. The Dragon Master was not surprised either. The Dragon Master had once deduced that the neo martial world might be the same as Tian Fang. There were eighth and ninth-grade powerhouses, but they had left with their people, just like the master of Tian Fang.He left behind an empty world. It was just that the tianfang experts had left the tianfang world intact, while the other party might have taken away all the energy, leaving behind a completely empty shell ...All of this was deduced by the Dragon Lord according to some clues.The old man continued,"therefore, neo martial's great Dao universe, the yin-yang universe, and the Dao of origin might be a ninth-tier great Dao universe! Of course, it probably hasn't fully recovered yet ...""A ninth-rank world?" Feng Yan was shocked."Neo martial is a ninth-rank world?""From the current deductions ... I think so."The old man nodded. Otherwise, he couldn't explain it. He believed in the Dragon Master's deduction. Since the Dragon Master said so, it meant that a million years ago, there really were cultivators from the neo martial world."I see!"Feng Yan was relieved. No wonder the neo martial artist was so powerful. It turned out that he had the foundation of a ninth-rank world.Of course, there was no actual evidence, but if the Dragon Lord said so, then it must be."Then, venerable Emperor Black Dog isn't the heavenly Hound ...""Probably not."The old man wasn't 100% sure either. He smiled and said,""If it's the heavenly Hound, the Scarlet sun region will have the opportunity to enter the seventh rank. If it comes to our side, it won't have the chance. Neo martial arts is in urgent need of experts who can enter the seventh rank. Why would they throw out this kind of expert who is at the peak of the sixth rank and can even fight against the seventh rank? instead, they're gathering all the experts outside to fight the Scarlet sun region ...""Then I'm overthinking it," Feng Yan nodded."Of course, we have to be prepared."The old man laughed."Feng Yan, it's not bad that you can consider this. You've matured a lot. Now that you're at the peak of the sixth level, there's a great chance that you'll be able to reach the seventh level. It's only right that you develop some of your own forces." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Feng Yan's expression changed slightly."Don't worry," the old man said with a smile."There's no need to misunderstand. The fire Phoenix realm is definitely not your end! If you can reach the seventh step ...""Then your future will definitely surpass your mother 's!" The old man smiled meaningfully.The Dragon Lord's daughter, a Dragon and a Phoenix.The peak of the sixth step!Once she entered rank seven, her two bloodlines would become one, and she would become a rank seven venerable sovereign. She even had the hope of inheriting the Dragon Lord's hegemony for a thousand years ... Of course, the Dragon Lord would definitely not die, but Feng Yan was much more outstanding than the few descendants of the dragon Lord.Her mother had also been raising her. As for the Dragon children in the dragon world, they didn't have many opportunities to display their skills because there were many powerful people in the dragon world. They didn't have as many opportunities as Feng Yan, who was independent."A fifth-rank venerable sovereign," the old man continued."If you have a good foundation, it's not too difficult for you to enter the sixth rank. Before you enter the seventh rank, it's worth it to recruit some sixth-rank foreign clans."

Chapter 3175 The Curtain Guest (3)
As for the Tier 6 experts in the fiery phoenix World, they were all the foundation of the fiery phoenix master, not Feng Yan 's.The old man was thinking more. The Phoenix Clan couldn't be too dominant in the dragon world.In fact, he hoped that Feng Yan could recruit some powerful cultivators from other clans. Otherwise, if Feng Yan wanted to go to the dragon world and brought powerful cultivators from the inferno Phoenix Clan with him, he might be rejected!After getting the old man's approval, Feng Yan smiled.""I understand. Feng Yan knows what to do.""Yes.""Yes." The old man nodded."You can inform me when you sign the agreement of the great Dao. I'll go over just in case!" The agreement of the great path could not be signed randomly. Of course, it was worth it to recruit a fifth stage venerable sovereign. However, you must be careful of any loopholes. Even the red moon sovereign, a rank eight master, suffered a great loss last time. "At the mention of this, the old man also laughed.He was too confident and too arrogant.He had rashly signed the contract and even brought forest orchid master along. He had been tricked by the other party. Not only had he been tricked, but the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns from the three great seventh rank worlds had all been tricked to death!After the battle, there was only one level eight itinerant cultivator left. If not for the great Dao Alliance, he would not have suffered such a heavy blow."Fengyan knows."The fire Phoenix Princess nodded. She had come to see this person this time to test the Dragon race's attitude towards the fire Phoenix realm's recruitment of experts. On the other hand, she was worried that there would be some problems. She didn't care much about the great Dao contract in the past, but it had shocked everyone last time.​ With this experienced and prudent tier 7 dragon clan member keeping watch, she did not have much to worry about.……Li Hao had waited for more than a day.The other party seemed to have deliberately delayed him. It was not until the third day that Feng Yan appeared again. He said apologetically,""The Dao master has gone out and hasn't returned. I've neglected fellow Daoist these days! But luckily, I've already asked for the advice of some elders and obtained everyone's approval ... However, I don't know if fellow Daoist is able to accept a few conditions. ""What's your condition? just state it,"Li Hao said in a deep voice."First ... Some elders of my Fire Phoenix World would like to spar with fellow Daoist. They're all fifth-tier."Li Hao didn't say anything. After thinking for a while, he said,""What else?""Secondly, you said that you have cultivated a rank five world. Are there still venerable sovereigns in this world? My realm elder wants to go in and explore ... Of course, I also know that this is a bit difficult, but fellow Daoist, don't worry, my realm elder is only going to explore the outer realm. The main reason is that we are worried that there are enemy experts lurking inside ..."Speaking of this, Feng Yan looked a little apologetic and said,""This has always been the rule. All venerable sovereigns who carry worlds must do this. It's not just you.""Investigate?" Li Hao was displeased."The world is mine. It has always been in my stomach. Who will sneak in?" He might as well say that he was an enemy! Although the world is not a secret, if an outsider were to come to my world ... Wouldn't that mean that you would be able to find out everything? If a cultivator doesn't have any secrets, is he still a cultivator?""I also know that this isn't very appropriate ... But these are the rules!"This time, Feng Yan didn't give in. She smiled and said,""Don't worry, fellow Daoist. We're mainly searching for the aura of the Dao universe. As long as there's no aura of the Dao universe, it means that no experts from other great worlds have sneaked in. That's enough. We won't probe too deeply."Li Hao secretly cursed. I know.More importantly, my world, the Silver Moon world, really has a universe of the great path.This was a problem!Li Hao considered for a while and said,""It's not impossible ... But it can't be a strong one. At most ... Level five!"Li Hao seemed to be a little dissatisfied."Not to mention level five, even level one venerable sovereigns are enough. I'm just checking the aura of the great path universe. Otherwise, if an expert enters my stomach, it's the same as handing their life over to you. They won't be able to resist at all ...""Sure!"Feng Yan nodded. That was not a problem.Since he had agreed, that was for the best.Although the possibility of the other party bringing along a powerful world was not high, they still had to be careful. If it was a seventh-rank world, a fifth-rank venerable sovereign would not be able to carry it."Third, the great Dao contract can be signed, and the territory can be given to fellow Daoist. However, fellow Daoist is not allowed to devour any world or enter any world. You can take a portion of the offerings, but it can not exceed 20% of the resources produced by the world. Otherwise, not only will our realm hold you accountable, but the Dragon Realm will not allow such a situation to happen.""Fourth, you are not allowed to attack any cultivators of the fire Phoenix Sector, including those of the chaos alliance ..."Li Hao said unhappily, then if the fire Phoenix Sector and the Alliance world go to war one day, I can't help either? He could only be killed by other experts? Are you so sure that we won't have any conflicts with the other worlds in the next tens of thousands of years, Daoist Phoenix Flame?"“……”This was true.Feng Yan laughed and nodded."Fellow Daoist's concern is reasonable. Let's only limit it to the cultivators of the fire Phoenix realm ..." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "That won't do either!"Li Hao shook his head,"I work for the strong, not for the weak!" 'I can only restrict myself from attacking rank six and rank seven venerable sovereigns. Otherwise, if a weakling provokes a rank five venerable sovereign, do I have to tolerate it?' I'm only here to serve the strong in exchange for resources, not to be a slave ... If you're not willing, then forget it!""At the same time, a rank seven venerable sovereign can kill me easily ... So I don't dare to set any limits, and it's meaningless! However, among the sixth level venerable sovereigns in the fire Phoenix realm, other than the princess, any venerable sovereigns who attack me will have to pay the price of the lightning at the same time ... Of course, for these, the sixth level lightning tribulation will do. It's only a deterrent, not to kill, but to protect myself!"

"Fellow Daoist, do you mean that other than the seventh-rank spiritual beasts and me, anyone else who attacks you or the other sixth-rank spiritual beasts will suffer the lightning tribulation?""Right!""I'm a rank five venerable sovereign," Li Hao said gloomily."I'm here to strengthen myself, not to be a servant for the fire Phoenix realm. If that's the case ... Why would I join the fire Phoenix realm?" With such a high price, what difference would it make if I joined any rank seven world? It's said that all rivers run into the sea of the fire Phoenix World. Princess's previous agreement was too strict. If that's the case ... I can only give up on this agreement ..."Feng Yan thought about it for a while. This was also her first time leading the recruitment of a fifth rank venerable sovereign. She did not have much experience. Thinking about it carefully, it was indeed harsh.In the past few days, she had also checked on the few level five venerable sovereigns she had recruited. In fact, some of them had not signed the great Dao contract at all.Even if they did, the conditions wouldn't be so harsh.Of course, she was also just in case. She was worried that this guy was involved with neo martial arts ...After some consideration, excluding the seventh rank and himself, there was no problem."Fellow Daoist is right on this point ... Our Fire Phoenix realm is not a Harsh Realm. It's just that recently, chaos has been in turmoil, so ...""I understand!""Do you have any other requests?" Li Hao nodded and asked. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "There's one more thing. "Princess Fire Phoenix chuckled as if she was a little embarrassed, but she still said,""The time limit is 30000 years. Within this time limit, if fellow Daoist ... I mean, if you can reach Grade 7, this time limit will be extended to 100000 years!"Li Hao said indifferently,'if I can reach Level Seven in the fire Phoenix Sector, what's 500000 years to me? I was wondering what it was ...""In addition, if fellow Daoist can reach the seventh stage, the power of the Tribulation lightning will increase to the eighth stage!"Princess Fire Phoenix added.He looked at Li Hao without saying a word.This was the key."If you really are the tengou...Once you reach the seventh rank, you're overthinking if you think you won't die from the seventh rank lightning. The tengou1 is a powerhouse at the peak of the sixth rank and can fight against the seventh rank. Once you reach the seventh rank, you probably won't have to fear the seventh rank lightning.Since that was the case ... He would increase the price!Li Hao still didn't care."I'm only at the fifth level. It's hard to even reach the sixth level, let alone the seventh. If I really reach the seventh level, I won't be afraid of the eighth level." He agreed very readily."Sure!"At this moment, Princess Fire Phoenix finally heaved a sigh of relief. Since he had agreed so readily, there shouldn't be a big problem.She had just heaved a sigh of relief when Li Hao said,""Since fellow Daoist has already stated your conditions, I have a few small requests ... I hope fellow Daoist can consider them.""Fellow Daoist, please speak."Princess Fire Phoenix didn't mind. The conditions she put forward were all quite harsh, so it was normal for the other party to have some requirements."First, a rank six world, a Water-type world. Second, the hundred Jie fields......The medium and small worlds take up at least sixty percent of them. I don't want the so-called territories to be some unranked worlds. ""Third, within the territory, other than the local realm Lord, no other foreign venerable sovereigns are allowed to enter without my permission ... Not to mention the other realm's venerable sovereigns, even the fire Phoenix realm's venerable sovereigns are not allowed to enter. Once they enter, they will definitely be baptized by the lightning tribulation!" "What?" Princess Fire Phoenix frowned and said softly,'fellow Daoist, this ... Isn't very appropriate, right? It's normal that no other venerable sovereigns are allowed to enter, but ... After all, this is the territory of the fire Phoenix realm. The venerable sovereigns of my realm may wander around and are not allowed to enter ... I'm afraid this is not appropriate!""Then ..." Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"you can't enter without my permission. You need my permission. Otherwise, I'm worried that you'll be suddenly killed by an expert one day ..."How could this be?Princess Fire Phoenix was speechless.These rogue cultivator chaos beasts had a strong sense of danger."Sure!""Also," Li Hao continued,"for the first ten years, I won't be contributing to the fire Phoenix Sector. I need to digest the level 6 world and prepare for my advancement ...""That's not a problem either!"Princess Fire Phoenix agreed readily. Ten years was actually a very short time.It was normal for a rank five Supreme Emperor to take a hundred years to absorb a rank six great world.Ten years was a very short time."Finally, I can freely arrange the arrangement of the world within my territory.""What?"The fire Phoenix Princess was confused. Li Hao explained,""For example, I can gather all the worlds together and protect my world! I can move the world ... And form a protective circle ..."You really are!Princess Fire Phoenix was speechless. You're so afraid of death in my Fire Phoenix realm?He was really speechless!If there really was an expert that could kill you, to be honest, even those middle and small sector Lords wouldn't be able to stop him.Of course, this was not a big problem.They were just gathering for warmth!"That's fine as well, but I'll have to remind you that once more than a hundred worlds gather together and absorb a large amount of chaotic force, the surrounding area will quickly be emptied ..."Li Hao smiled."That's simple. I'll just change locations after a period of time. I can change my original territory at will. After I'm done with this place, I'll move ..."Alright, as long as you're not tired!The fire Phoenix Princess didn't have any objections to this. It was just a small matter. The few things that Li Hao mentioned were all small matters."I agree!""Many thanks, Princess!"

Li Hao smiled."It's a pity that the princess isn't willing to promise me the resources to reach Level 6. Otherwise ... Even if I extend my service to 100000 years, I'd still be willing ..."Princess Fire Phoenix smiled and said nothing."If you don't advance ... Then you'll be in big trouble. Some guys, although there's no big barrier between the fifth and sixth step, but ... It's not impossible for them to break through.At that time, wouldn't the fire Phoenix realm be in trouble?In the past, they might not have cared about such a trap. But now, everyone was extremely wary of the great Dao Alliance. They had to consider every little thing carefully to avoid any big trouble."If you don't have any objections, fellow Daoist, then we can sign the agreement at any time. But before that ... I might need you to come with me to meet with a few of the flamephoenix elders ....""Sure!"Li Hao was very calm.Assessment, right?Worried that I'm just for show ... Who's afraid of that?……The two of them quickly flew toward the city in the sky.A moment later, Li Hao landed on a huge square. At this moment, there were only a few fiery phoenix elders. Some of them had transformed into human forms, while some were still in their true Phoenix forms. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Waves of monstrous flame power rose.There were rank five and rank six venerable sovereigns.In addition to these guys, there were a few cultivators from other races. It was obvious that they weren't from the fire Phoenix race. They didn't have strong fire power and lacked the signs of the universe being covered.Princess Fire Phoenix didn't say much. She pointed at the cultivators in the square and said,""Fellow Daoist, you can choose anyone and have a friendly sparring session with them ... It'll be fine if we can all exchange our knowledge!""If fellow Daoist ... Can't defeat a single one of them, the rank six world is also a huge temptation for them. Perhaps ... I'll have to consider whether or not I should continue to fulfill the agreement!"Li Hao didn't waste any time. He controlled the Black Panther's body and looked at the venerable sovereigns. After a long time, he looked at a bear-like beast and pointed at it with his claw."This fellow Daoist will do, let's spar!"The black bear glanced at Li Hao coldly.Obviously, he felt that the other party had underestimated him.They were both at the fifth step, but this newcomer had quite the guts.He didn't waste any words. In the next moment, an extremely strong force spread from the ground. A huge vibration spread from the ground, and with a boom, the world seemed to be collapsing!The giant bear instantly transformed into a thousand-meter-tall beast and slapped Li Hao!Some of the experts in the surroundings took a look."This Black Dog venerable sovereign is really picky," someone said."Daoist Ju Li's Dao is simple, but he's strong enough to defeat ten opponents. Even a sixth rank venerable sovereign won't feel good after taking a direct hit from him ..."Although Dao techniques were simple, the Dao of chaos was brutal to begin with, and it was also a Dao of tremendous strength. A single palm strike could shatter the heavens and shatter the earth.Under Li Hao's control, the Black Panther flickered and disappeared.In the next moment, a wave of water power spread in all directions.It was like a huge wave!It was silent and there was no sign of the Black Panther. In the next moment, the hearts of the few rank six venerable sovereigns on the outside moved, and the Black Panther appeared out of thin air. Its speed was so fast that they could not catch it. In an instant, the dog's paw appeared, and the sound of waves instantly overlapped.One wave after another!A claw slashed out!BOOM!The bear's paw suddenly changed its direction, but the Black Panther did not Dodge it. Instead, it struck out with its paw. The others shook their heads when they saw this. The reaction speed of the mighty Supreme Emperor was not slow. The Black Dog also carried the world, so it might not be faster than the mighty Supreme Emperor.Now, in a head-on confrontation ... The other party was on the path of tremendous strength.Just as he was thinking, suddenly, the sound of waves shook the sky. BOOM!With a loud bang, the dog's paw was slightly shattered. The giant bear's eyes revealed a cold glint. The other party was no match for it at all. However, at that moment, the Black Panther roared. BOOM!A second explosion rang out!Then, the third, the fourth ...The huge waves stacked on top of each other!The power of countless great DAOs around him was instantly absorbed, and huge waves erupted one after another, stacking up madly."Water element ...""There's also ... Stacking?""Interesting!""It looks like a stacking type of Tao technique ... But it has a high requirement on the physical body and can only be used for a short period of time ...""This venerable Emperor Black dog's body seems to be quite Well-Tempered ..." Just as the few Fire Phoenix powerhouses were discussing, with a final deafening sound, the nine layers were completed with a boom. With a bang, the bear Paw exploded!Heibao did not continue.As for the giant bear, when it saw that its paw had been shattered, it was a little cold. It didn't say anything and just retreated silently. The paw began to recover.Upon seeing this, Princess Fire Phoenix smiled.Not bad!Juli was considered one of the stronger rank five venerable sovereigns he had recruited, but his strongest Bear Paw had been shattered by this person. It was clear that this Black Dog was stronger.Of course, compared to some venerable sovereigns who had the support of a great world, he was still slightly inferior.But it was already very good!In that case, it was worth it."Not bad!"Princess Fire Phoenix smiled."Fellow Daoist Black Dog and fellow Daoist juli, you've both worked hard ... Fellow Daoist juli, you can go to the storehouse and receive 10 million great Dao crystals to repair your injuries. We're all on the same side. It's just a spar, so there's no need to be angry!""Many thanks, Your Highness!"The mighty force Emperor smiled. 10 million great Dao crystals were equivalent to a small world. He had suffered a small loss in a spar, but he had obtained 10 million great Dao crystals. That didn't seem too bad.

Li Hao only watched silently. How generous.Also, this group of beasts of primordial chaos was extremely familiar with the use of kindness and severity. In the past, they had only imagined martial strength, but at this moment, it was completely shattered.Seeing is believing, hearing is not.At this moment, Princess Fire Phoenix said,""The signing of the great Dao agreement requires an expert to preside over it ... Fellow Daoist, do you know how to sign it?"Li Hao shook his head."It's very simple ... Fellow Daoist, all you need to do is split up a small portion of your daosource and fuse it into the contract. As for me, I'll use the daosource of the fire Phoenix World to fuse with and bear witness to each other. The daosource and the origin of great DAOs are all in the chaos, whether it's the great Dao universe or the great Dao of chaos! Thus, by sacrificing some great Dao power, the chaos will bear witness to all of this!"Li Hao controlled the Black Panther and nodded.He knew this.In fact, he had some means to avoid signing the contract, and it would not be a problem to hide it from this sixth-rank, but ... There was a seventh-rank here, so he was not prepared to fake it.Other than not using Black Panther's Dao source but his own, he had no intention of not signing the agreement on purpose.If the other party wanted an expert to bear witness ... It might be a seventh step.Sure enough, at this moment, an old man silently appeared. He didn't have a powerful aura, but Li Hao instantly became serious!Rank 7 venerable sovereign! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It wasn't the fiery phoenix Sector Lord, but ... A member of the Dragon race. He could feel the aura of the Dragon race from the other party.The old man glanced at the Black Panther and smiled. Without saying anything, a contract of Dao appeared. He looked at Li Hao and then at the fire Phoenix Princess."Take a look at the contents. They're all condensed from Dao runes. If there's nothing wrong, the Black Dog can just cut off some of the power of the daosource. The same goes for the Phoenix Flame ..."After he had finished speaking, he looked at Black Panther and said meaningfully: "It's very easy for me to determine whether or not it's my daosource, and whether or not it's a rank five daosource!"Li Hao didn't say anything. At this moment, he had completely integrated into Black Panther.The Black Panther had taken over a body.At this moment, the Black Panther had transformed into the Silver Moon heaven's will, and its body was completely under Li Hao's control.Li Hao didn't say anything. A moment later, a small star-like object appeared in front of him. Like the moon, it flickered with a mysterious radiance ...The old man took a look and his eyes flickered.He glanced at Li Hao a few more times. This daosource ... It was a great taboo to explore someone's daosource, but at this moment, he had the urge to explore it deeply. This daosource seemed to be the convergence of many great DAOs, and it was much purer than the chaos great Dao.It was as if it had been refined by the great Dao universe.Furthermore, there was more than one Dao source. There seemed to be some special great Dao mixed in, causing the entire Dao source to look extremely mysterious."Emperor Black Dog ... Not bad."The old man smiled, looked at Feng Yan, and said,""He's not bad. He doesn't just cultivate the five elements great Dao, so it's not convenient to investigate his Dao origin. However, it's indeed a fifth-rank Dao origin, which is connected to the Black Dog's aura ... It gives me the feeling that even an ordinary sixth-rank venerable sovereign's Dao origin might not be as rich as this Black dog's ...""Is it the heavenly Hound?" Feng Yan's heart stirred. "No, the heavenly Hound cultivates the Dao of devouring. It can tell at a glance unless the heavenly Hound has completely changed its Dao ... That's impossible. If that's the case, the heavenly Hound would have reached Level Seven long ago!"Overlord Phoenix Flame heaved a sigh of relief. He was a little happy and sent a message,""Grandmaster, does that Black Dog have a good chance of entering the sixth step?""Not much. The more mysterious and powerful his great Dao is, the more energy it consumes. A rank six world might not be enough ..."No wonder!Feng Yan understood now. No wonder this guy kept saying that he could agree to more conditions if he made sure he reached the sixth step.So that was how it was!How treacherous!"Grandmaster, are you saying that it's not because I'm not talented enough, but because I'm too talented, I'll have to consume more energy and my Dao will be stronger ... That's why I can't enter level six?""Not bad.""That's a good thing ..."Feng Yan laughed. At this moment, he no longer hesitated, and a flame power rose from his body.Indistinctly, a universe seemed to appear.A monstrous fire appeared in the sky and gathered into a ball of light. In the next moment, Li Hao's Dao origin, the Dao origin of the fire Phoenix World, instantly fused with the great Dao scroll.At this moment, it was still not enough. "Die!" The fire Phoenix Princess shouted in a low voice. A world appeared in her hand and instantly burned as a sacrifice for the signing of the agreement.It was as if a monstrous pressure was looming over them, and it also seemed like a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation was about to descend ...Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. This was the first time he had signed a great Dao agreement.He really did sense a faint aura of chaos tribulation lightning ... Interesting. Chaos tribulation lightning could actually bear witness to all of this. What was going on?Was it also a type of chaos law?In the past, he didn't care about it.The next moment, a weak aura swept around, engulfing Li Hao and the fire Phoenix Princess. At that moment, Li Hao seemed to understand something. It was as if the chaos was telling him that the contract could not be violated, and those who violated it would be punished by lightning!As for Princess Fire Phoenix, she revealed a smile at this moment. She let out a low growl, and her aura surged.The covenant of Dao in front of him shattered instantly and scattered between heaven and earth. Soon, it disappeared without a trace!"Fellow Daoist Black Dog!"The fire Phoenix Princess smiled radiantly. At this moment, this guy had truly become her subordinate. A fifth rank venerable sovereign with good talent. He had picked up an advantage.

A medium-level world also appeared in her hand. She suppressed it and the power of water surged."This is the world you want, but ... Some of the world's power has seeped out, and there are no people ...""That's enough!"Li Hao nodded."Also ... If you don't mind, can you send an elder into your inner space to check it out?" Thearch Fire Phoenix asked with a smile.Li Hao nodded. They had already agreed on this.He didn't say much. He controlled the Black Panther and opened its mouth. A Tier 5 firephoenix elder flew into the air. He glanced at the firephoenix Princess and quickly flew into the huge mouth!In the blink of an eye, it was as if he had traveled through space, and the elder saw another world.The entire world seemed to be full of life.He didn't enter and only looked outside. The next moment, a special force appeared in his hand, as if it was guiding the great Dao universe! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This was a commonly used method to probe the power of the great Dao universe.At the same time, a weak destructive energy suppressed the entire world of the Silver Moon, suppressing all the power of the great Dao.Kong Ji also cursed in his heart. This was really troublesome.And inside the Silver Moon, a cat opened its mouth as if it wanted to swallow the Silver Moon dual Dao universe into its stomach. It was also choking so much that its eyes rolled back!When will it end? ……The outer realm.The level five venerable sovereign did not detect any power of the great path or the universe. Not only that, but there were no venerable sovereigns in the entire world!After all, it was a rank five world!This Black Dog was really brutal.This was normal. Some beasts of primordial chaos did not like the birth of other venerable sovereigns in the world. When a new venerable sovereign appeared, they would either eat it or kill it ... It was normal for there to be no venerable sovereigns.After continuing to investigate, elder firephoenix quickly returned. ……A moment later, the elder came out of the black Panther's mouth.Looking at Feng Yan, he shook his head slightly and said,""It's a rank five world. It's very young and full of vitality ... But ... There are no venerable sovereigns in the world. They were probably all killed by this Black Dog! It's the human world, possibly a world devoured by the other three regions. ""The Black Dog refined a world?""Yes, I can sense some of the world's consciousness ... This world seems to have great potential. No wonder he's unwilling to devour it and brought it here. It looks like he's going to stay in the Dragon field and become the Lord of a region."At this moment, Feng Yan was completely relieved.This was good!In order to subdue a fifth stage venerable sovereign, he had been on high alert. If it was his mother, things might not have been so complicated. However, this was good. This was the first fifth stage venerable sovereign that he had subdued with his own hands!The next moment, she revealed a bright smile.""Black Dog, all our agreements are in effect now! Next, you can go to the fire Phoenix Pavilion and get some things you need, including some knowledge and culture of the fire Phoenix realm. In the fire Phoenix realm, venerable sovereigns are not only synonymous with killing, but also ... Profound knowledge!"Li Hao looked reluctant, as if he didn't like these things.Feng Yan didn't find it strange, but he smiled and said,""You must know that the chaos race is able to establish themselves here not only because of their martial prowess, but also because of ... Many other things that you can't even imagine! Feng Shan, bring the Black Dog to receive some inheritances ... After that, you can go to your territory at any time, or just stay in the fire Phoenix World and devour the rank six world. I'll look for you if I need you. ""Many thanks, Princess!"Li Hao said no more. A level four venerable sovereign walked out and flew toward the city with Li Hao. This time, he was a little different. He was much more enthusiastic and said,"Senior black Dog, you're the first venerable sovereign that His Highness has accepted in many years ... Congratulations!"Li Hao smiled and said telepathically,"I'm just trying to make a living. Of course, reaching level six is my lifelong dream. I don't like to be restricted ..."Supreme Emperor Feng Shan didn't say anything and just smiled.The agreement has been signed, but it's not up to you anymore!How could he not work after receiving the benefits?The venerable sovereigns of the fire Phoenix realm were eager to recruit more venerable sovereigns. Once they were recruited, they would be the ones to charge into the battle, while the danger of the venerable sovereigns of the fire Phoenix realm would be greatly reduced.At this moment, he didn't really care about the cold attitude of the other party. If they were to really fight, they would be much safer, and the rest of them would just be cannon fodder!
