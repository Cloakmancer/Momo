        There was a limit to the absorption of mysterious energy.
        Li Hao was able to do it because his sword could neutralize it.
        Otherwise, no matter how good his physical fitness was, he would only be able to absorb a little more mysterious energy than the average person. He would not be able to absorb more than 30 points of mysterious energy so easily like he was doing now.
        "Elder Yuan is in urgent need of the mysterious energy?" Liu Long asked. I ..."
        "Eat your food!"
        Yuan Shuo directly interrupted him. How could he not know about Liu Long's little background?
        Last time, Liu Long got a lot of mysterious energy. In total, he got close to 50 cubic meters, which was not a small amount.
        But to Yuan Shuo, this was nothing.
        Li Hao needed to forge the five internal organs and balance the five elements energy. Liu Long's was not suitable to begin with, and there were only a few of them. An ordinary one that broke 100 was enough, but Li Hao's was far from enough.
        Liu Long also stopped talking.
         After eating a few mouthfuls of rice, he was almost full. Then, he started talking about serious business."Elder Yuan, is there any more information about the three sun glory?"
        He only knew about the three sunlit experts.
        Was it the early, middle, or late stage?
        What abilities were they good at?
        They knew almost nothing about their enemies. Other than knowing their cultivation realms and numbers, they had no idea what their enemies were.
        Under such circumstances, it was hard to guarantee that nothing would go wrong.
        "No, I didn 't,"
        Yuan Shuo replied and added,"I asked Hao lianchuan to come as a backup!" Don't call him when you're eating meat, but if something happens ... Call him!"
        Liu Long was stunned.
        Yuan Shuo continued,"shouldn't the higher-ups send someone to congratulate you on the establishment of your branch?" He, Hao lianchuan, was the most suitable! The reason I'm here to congratulate you is to not only show how important it is, but also to suppress the supers here so that they won't get involved. The last thing ... If there's a mistake, Hao lianchuan can help you clean it up in time. "
        That's right, this was Yuan Shuo's plan.
        He had forced the other party to send the things over tonight. Other than Hao lianchuan, who else could come overnight and deliver the things?
        As for whether he would come or not ... Even if he didn't come tonight, he would still come tomorrow.
        And it was definitely Hao lianchuan!
        Because of the mysterious energy, other than Hao lianchuan, the average sunlight would not dare to cross thousands of miles to transport it. Did they really think that there were no supers in the wilderness who would Rob people?
        Li Hao couldn't help but exclaim in admiration,"teacher's thinking is really perfect!"[ 1]
        Of course, it was hard to say how Hao lianchuan would react.
        "Don't worry about what he thinks,"Yuan Shuo continued,"can't the night patrolmen clear out wanted criminals?" Moreover, the various families are waiting to cooperate with us to explore the remains, so as long as it's not an all-out war, it shouldn't be a big problem. The premise is that these people don't know Qiao Feilong's strength. "
        The two of them nodded.
        "So, we have to deal with the three of them by ourselves?" Liu Long pondered for a moment.
        He thought about it for a while and remembered that Yuan Shuo had told him to let Hao lianchuan clean up the mess. There shouldn't be too much of a problem.
         Of course, no plan could be perfect. This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wealth was found in danger!
        If Yuan Shuo wasn't afraid, then he had nothing to be afraid of.
        "Then, when I go back, I'll make some appropriate arrangements. I'll also need the cooperation of others. At the very least, I'll be prepared to encircle and annihilate them."
        "Right, I'm afraid there's no shortage of ordinary people in the mine. If we use weapons of mass destruction ..."
        He was a little hesitant.
        In this regard, Yuan Shuo was actually more ruthless than him.
        However, Yuan Shuo also knew his character. He did not directly say that he did not need to care and began to consider it.
        Li Hao interjected."They're exploring the relic. It's impossible for ordinary people to enter that area. I've observed that the three sunlit experts are still a distance away from the ordinary people's Kuangqu. They're about a kilometer away."
        It wasn't far. In fact, it was very close!
        However, it was a thousand meters away. As long as he was careful, he could avoid it.
        "If you think it's inappropriate, boss, I have a suggestion," Li Hao said after some thought.
        "Tell me."
        "Vacation!"
        Liu Long was stunned. Vacation?
        He quickly thought about it and frowned.""There's no reason to take a break!"
        Li Hao laughed,"why not?" The day after tomorrow, our Nightwalker division will open for business. To celebrate this day, to celebrate the establishment of Blizzard Silver city's own superpower organization, the day after tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, the entire city will rest! To the upper echelons of Silver City, this is just a simple vacation. "
        Most people would go home during the two-day holiday.
        This was especially so for the mines. They were usually too tired and finally had a holiday. They would definitely not stay in the mines. Of course, not all of them would leave. Some would definitely stay, but by then, there would be much fewer people.
        With a distance of a thousand meters, the losses would be minimized.
        "Won't we alert the enemy?"
         Liu Long thought for a moment and asked.
        "The whole city is on holiday, not just the Qiao family!"
        Li Hao laughed."And they're only targeting ordinary people. The Qiao's won't be suspicious."
        "We still have to be on guard!"
        Yuan Shuo interjected,""Also, do you think there's any point in setting up the night watchers and giving ordinary people a holiday? Also, will Mrs. Qiao be obedient and let him have a holiday?"
        Yuan Shuo glanced at Li Hao and shook his head.""You're quite smart, but you're prone to making mistakes at critical moments. "
        Li Hao lowered his head and didn't say anything.
        Since his teacher had said so, perhaps he had a way.
        "It's not reliable to let people take a break ..."
        Yuan Shuo narrowed his eyes."About a thousand meters away from the three sunbeams, right? then I'll make a trip there tonight. I'll cause an accident and make the mine collapse. That'll do!" I'm familiar with that area. I've been there once to open a new mine. In the original collapsed area, with a little bit of tampering, the collapse will continue, and no one will go into the mine at night. If it collapses, the Qiao's will have a holiday, and it will be difficult to recover without ten days or half a month. "
       
        Liu Long nodded slightly,"it's okay to collapse the mine. Anyway, it's not the first time there. When I was in the law enforcement team, there were several collapses in the Qiao's mine. However, no one was hurt, so the matter was settled."
        "It's normal!"
        Yuan Shuo laughed,"the area they collapsed should be close to the remains, so naturally, there are not many people. It's just that the collapse happened, so they could only reorganize. The remains should have started to be developed now. In recent years, there have been more than one or two collapses. It's not a big deal if there's one more. In order to prevent people from spying, they will definitely let the workers leave."
        Li Hao nodded. This was not bad.
        As for suspicion ... It wasn't the first time. Mrs. Qiao might be more worried than anyone else. Everyone would pay attention to that side, and would want to immediately close down for rectification, in case someone came to check.
        Therefore, once there was an accident, it would be stopped immediately.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Can teacher avoid their detection?"
        "Nonsense, I'm a Martial Master, not a superhuman!"  "Shut up!" Yuan Shuo scolded. This was the greatest advantage of being a Martial Master. Inner strength was generated from the body, and there was nothing special about it.
        It was extremely difficult for supers to sense the presence of martial masters.
         Li Hao laughed dryly and didn't say anything.
        With the General Plan confirmed, Liu Long had no more worries. As for whether it would succeed or not ... It would depend on luck.
        Whether he could deal with the three sunlit cultivators would depend on his luck.
        ……
        His teacher and Liu Long were both very willing to bet. In fact, according to Li Hao's thoughts, it might be more secure to ask Hao lianchuan to act together.
        But these two didn't have such thoughts at this moment.
        He would solve it if he could, but he would look at it again if he couldn 't. This didn't meet Li Hao's expectations.
        But Li Hao could only do so at this moment.
        After that, they continued to eat and didn't talk about this matter anymore.
        ……
        After the meal, Li Hao and Liu Long left together.
        As for the floor tiles in the teacher's room, someone would naturally deal with them. It was none of Li Hao's business.
        In the car.
        Liu Long closed his eyes and thought about something.
        When Li Hao was about to reach the inspection Office, Liu Long suddenly opened his eyes and said,""Do you think we should call Liu Yan and the others?"
        He actually asked Li Hao!
        Li Hao was a little surprised, but he still replied,""If they want to obtain more resources and are not afraid of danger, then Shout! If they felt that they could retire in peace and wait for their salary, then there was no need to shout! In fact, even if they don't get involved, if something happens to us, the Silver City will be in danger. "
        "Do you think we should ask them to join us?"
        "Boss should have considered it."
         Li Hao didn't say much. Liu Long wasn't an indecisive person. It was just that this matter involved several members of the sunlight group, and the members of the group were all his brothers and sisters, so he was overly worried.  Li Hao was sure that if he told Liu Yan and the others, they would probably choose to participate.
        As for Wang Ming and the others, he wasn't too sure.
        Liu Long was silent for a moment before he said,""Do you think we should call Wang Ming and the others for a small meeting later?"
        After all, they were considered outsiders.
        Li Hao thought for a while and said,"let's do it. The three of them are very young and have the drive!" "This is also an opportunity for the integration team. Otherwise, our team will be divided into two parts, and it will be difficult to integrate. Only by fighting together can we become one of us."
        "You're right. "
        Liu Long revealed a smile. A moment later, his expression returned to being cold and arrogant, "I've stepped into the thousand warrior realm. Although I don't know about the situation of the other three, I have the confidence to defeat them! They're just three rats, they've never appeared in the supernatural realm and might not even have fought before. In order to hide their existence, how much combat awareness do you think these three have?"
        "Probably not much."
        "Maybe you're not as good as me!" Li Hao laughed.
        "Not bad!"
        Liu Long nodded in agreement.
        It wasn't just the three of them. Qiao Feilong hadn't fought for many years. In the past, when he fought, he only had the strength of the tenth realm. Now, even if he had entered the three suns realm, how much battle awareness would he have?
        It was fine when it came to killing the weak, but what about when it came to dealing with powerhouses of the same level?
        At this moment, Liu Long was filled with confidence. It was unknown if he was trying to comfort himself or if he really thought so.
        ……
        At the law enforcement building.
        Wang Ming, who had just gone to a few companies, couldn't help complaining to Hu Hao when he heard that there was going to be another meeting."Originally, when others said that there were many meetings in Whitemoon city, I deeply agreed! In the end, when I arrived in Silver City, I discovered that there were many little B * stards in the temple!"
        It's only been a few days, how many meetings have been held?
         Meetings when you have nothing to do!
        He was very dissatisfied with Liu Long. Initially, he thought that Liu Long was a guy who was indifferent to fame and fortune. After all, this guy had some reputation in the White moon City. In the eyes of the supers in the White moon City, Liu Long was a very stubborn guy.
        But now, no matter how she looked at it, she felt like a fan of the officials!
        Good Lord, now that he's the Minister, meetings come one after another, endless!
        Not only that, there's also an opening ceremony the night after tomorrow ... Bah!
        We're night patrols, not running a company.
        What kind of opening ceremony is this? aren't you afraid of laughing your head off?
        "I won't do anything serious!"
        Wang Ming ridiculed him again, but Hu Hao didn't respond. He was more reserved and usually didn't say too much.
        Li Meng, on the other hand, agreed with him and nodded.""It is! "Originally, the higher-ups wanted us to come to Silver City. I was thinking that it might be the same as last time. A battle might break out here, and it would be very dangerous. The higher-ups wanted to train us, so they arranged for us to come here. But these few days ... If I'm not in a meeting, then I'm just going around, going to the dojo, going to the company to eat and drink ... I'm so bored. "
       
        What the hell!
        At this time, Li Meng also felt that white moon City had overestimated the martial masters of Silver City.
        Ever since the last battle, these people seemed to have entered retirement mode. Each and every one of them was busy showing off their authority, which was boring.
        "Minister Wang, Li Meng, let's go to the meeting!"
        Hu Hao interjected. They were still in the law enforcement building.
        It would be bad if someone heard it.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The three of them could be considered as a team. Over the past few days, they had not blended in with Liu Yan and the others, and their relationship was only alright on the surface.
        Wang Ming snorted and got up."Let's go. I'd like to hear what you're saying today." He didn't go to the conference room but went to the basement for a meeting. He's so bored!"
        The few of them chatted and chatted as they walked towards the basement.
        This time, the meeting began there.
         ……
        In the basement.
        Liu Yan and the others arrived one after another. Yunyao and the others had actually been living here all along, so the office upstairs was empty most of the time.
        They were more used to this place.
        Seeing Li Hao and Liu Long enter together, they didn't care. Liu Yan, on the other hand, vaguely knew a little about them, but she didn't say anything.
        Seeing that Wang Ming and the others hadn't arrived yet, Liu Long swept a glance at Wu Chao and Chen Jian, frowning slightly."He only started absorbing the mysterious energy these two days?"
        The two of them nodded.
        "Absorb all the mysterious energy within two days. It doesn't matter if there are any hidden injuries. Absorb it all!"
        The two of them were stunned. Why was he in such a hurry?
        They were given 20 cubic meters. According to past situations, it would not be too much to suck him for half a year. After all, there might not be much income in the future. Of course, they had to spend sparingly to maximize their benefits.
        What's the rush?
        However, Liu Long's authority was still there, and the two of them trusted him very much. Soon, the two of them nodded and didn't ask anything.
        "Yunyao!"
        "Yes,"
        Yunyao raised her head and looked at Liu Long.
        "You're a water descent Esper, how much healing power do you have?"Liu Long said.
        "It's about the same as before,"
        Yunyao adjusted her glasses. She didn't wear glasses in the past, but now she liked to wear a pair of glasses. Li Hao knew a thing or two about them. They seemed to be able to see a red shadow, and yunyao used them to avoid the red shadow's pursuit.
        "Then you'll be the healer. You'll be in charge of the team's recovery until the actual light and healing powers enter the team."
        "Understood!"
        At these words, there was a knock on the door, and Wang Ming pushed it open and entered.  With a smile on his face, he looked at the few of them and nodded to Liu Long, wanting to find a place to sit ... He found that these guys were sitting randomly, so the fat Chen Jian simply sat on the ground.
        He was speechless and decided not to sit. He stood with Li Hao.
        Li Meng and Hu Hao did not sit down either. They walked over to Chen Jian and the others.
        Liu Long looked at the few of them and went straight to the point,"You guys are new here, so you're not familiar with us. We did have a joint battle before, but it was a short one."
        "I just want to ask you one thing. Did you come to the Silver City for gold, or did you really come to experience life and death?"
        Wang Ming was a little displeased,"to train myself, of course!" Gilded? If supers were not strong enough, would gold plating be useful? Chief Liu, aren't you underestimating us?"
        "Minister," Li Meng chimed in,"we came to the Silver City because we heard that the Silver City needed reinforcements. We're not here to play."
        "That's good!"
        Liu Long coldly said,"next, a battle will break out in Silver City. You don't need to know who the enemy is!" All you need to do is to follow orders, not be scared out of your wits, not ruin the plan, and not interfere with your teammates. That's all!"
        Battle?
        Wang Ming was taken aback. Where did this battle come from?
        "Minister, what's the enemy's strength?"
        "Sunlight!"
        Wang Ming frowned slightly."It's not that we can't deal with him, but it's indeed very dangerous. May I ask if he's from the three major organizations or some other superpower organization?"
        "You can be considered a member of the three great organizations!"
        "But now, what Whitemoon city means is that it's best not to take the initiative to start a conflict ..."
        "This is the Silver City!"
        "Therefore, my decision is the only one here!" Liu Long said coldly. Unless I step down and you come up, then you have the final say. Otherwise ... I have the final say!"
        Wang Ming pursed his lips. "Do as you please."
        He was not too afraid.
         There was only one sunlit, and the silver Blizzard city's strength was still alright. Although they did not have sunlit, there were four dark moons in the team, and two who had broken through the 100th level. They could still fight.
        As for danger ... Just as he said, encountering danger here was the life they imagined.
        Hu Hao, who hadn't spoken all this time, said,""Minister, do you have the time and place of the operation?"
        "I'll let you know when we're ready!"
        Alright, this meant that he didn't trust them.
        Of course, this was a normal phenomenon.
        Although he wasn't very satisfied, Wang Ming accepted it. He didn't mind it and asked,"Do you have a battle plan? How to cooperate? I'm a metal-type superhuman, Li Meng is a special-type superhuman, and Hu Hao is a sky-type superhuman. In Whitemoon city, if there's a battle between superhumans, they'll usually practice in advance so that they can cooperate well to avoid interference ..."
        "No need, as long as the three of you cooperate well!"
        Liu Long looked at him and said,"the three of you, be prepared. Be prepared for the sun glory to charge towards them. How can you stop them, or even stop them from escaping? this is what you should think about. If you can't do it ... Then tell me in advance!"
        Wang Ming's heart trembled slightly!
       
        The three of us should be prepared to resist the sunlight?
        This ... Was too exciting!
        He was a little excited, a little nervous, and a little embarrassed, but he still forced himself to say,""Um ... Minister, we ... We don't have enough combat experience. To put it bluntly, we don't work well together. If we really encounter riyao ... We might not be able to stop him."
        Liu Long laughed. He liked this guy's honesty.
        It was useless to brag now. If they were really dragged into the battlefield, they would be killed in an instant. It would only harm themselves and others.
        "The other party is also a newbie!"
        "Ah?"
        Wang Ming and the others were all stunned. Also a newbie?
        "There's a new player in riyao?"
        They couldn't believe that someone like riyao could still be a newbie.
         Sunlight was usually a super for at least ten years.
        As a super, whether it was a Night Watcher or other organizations, it was impossible for a super with more than ten years of experience to not have experienced a few battles, especially in sunlit. Unless the person was a priest blessed by the heavens, they would naturally cultivate to sunlit ... But it was hard to say.
        "He's probably a newbie ... I'm not 100% sure, but the possibility is as high as 90%! Even if he had fought, he would at most be at a lower level. He shouldn't have any battle experience of the same level!"
        Wang Ming let out a sigh of relief."If that's the case, then there's nothing to be afraid of. Hu Hao can fly, Li Meng can lock onto the position and distance, and I can attack. The three of us should be careful. We might not be able to deal with the other party, but we can run ... Ahem, but we can still restrain them."
        After suffering a loss last time, the three of them had some experience this time.
        "It's fine if you want to back out, but if you don't ... Then it's decided!"
        Liu Long finally said,"keep it a secret. Without my permission, you can't even reveal it to the White moon City!" Do you remember that?"
        "Understood!"
        "That's all for the meeting. Get ready for battle!"
        "Yes!"
        Everyone responded.
        The members of the demon hunting squad were all very calm. Sunlit was fine. They had killed Yue Ming in the past. Now that everyone had become stronger, it was understandable that they would kill sunlit.
        ……
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Liu Long's meeting was very short.
        The crowd dispersed.
        Wang Ming, however, grabbed Li Hao and said in a low voice as they walked,"Deal with the Milky Way?"
        "You guess?" Li Hao bared his teeth.
        “……”
        Guess my ass!
        He could only think of it this way. It was said that the Galaxy had supers at the level of Dark Moon, but did the Milky Way ... Do they have them?
        He did not know.
        "Forget it, I'll just deal with anyone, not the night patrolmen!"
        Wang Ming didn't have many requirements for this. As long as it wasn't his own people, it didn't matter who he was dealing with.
        "Will your teacher help?" he asked.
        "I might."
        With this, Wang Ming was relieved. With Martial Master douqian at his beck and call, his safety was guaranteed.
        It was just to deal with a sun glory!
        Even if these people weren't a match for him, Yuan Shuo was here. He would be hacked to death in a short while. Last time, Yuan Shuo hacked Ying Hongyue's son to death with a single blade strike. They had all seen it with their own eyes.
        It was too amazing!
        So at this moment, Wang Ming relaxed.
        Seeing that he seemed to be very relaxed, Li Hao said softly,""Be on your guard, it's not that simple! Treat any battle as your last one. This is what my teacher taught me, and I'll pass it on to you! It's common for a boat to capsize in a ditch. "
        "I understand!" Wang Ming frowned and nodded.
        After that, the two of them left.
        ……
        Soon, it was time to get off work.
        As usual, Li Hao didn't work overtime and got off work on time.
        His performance was extremely normal!
        No matter who observed Li Hao, they would only come to one conclusion: this guy was really boring.
        He went to work on time and got off work on time.
        Other than going to his teacher's house, he didn't go anywhere else. This lifestyle was even more disciplined than the old man 's.
        ……  Meanwhile, when Li Hao returned home.
        The yuan family.
        Hao lianchuan landed on the ground breathlessly and pushed the door open angrily.""Professor Yuan, do you really have to go this far? Using the inspector General to threaten people isn't a good idea!"
        He was somewhat dissatisfied!
        It was fine if he was joking normally, but mu Sen had said it so seriously that if he didn't come today, Yuan Shuo would kill him!
        Since it involved a city's inspector ... Even though Hao lianchuan was extremely busy, he still rushed over quickly.
        Yuan Shuo's threat was a little too much!
        He also overstepped the rules!
        "Where's the thing?"
        Yuan Shuo ignored him and went straight to the point."Did you bring the things? Don't say so much. You took my things and left. I haven't heard from you for many days, and you even swallowed the Li family's sword. If I don't take the initiative to ask for it, are you not going to give it to me? The night patrolman is going to commit a public robbery?"
        “……”
        "I'm helping you change the mysterious energy ..."Hao lianchuan said helplessly.
        "If the night patrolman can't even take out more than 1000 points of five-element mysterious energy, then he should close down his business!"
        Well, Hao lianchuan had nothing to say. Of course, he could take it out.
        However, he did want to delay it until after the remains exploration. In the end, this person refused, so he could not keep refusing to give it.
        "I've brought the items. 200 cubic meters of energy for each of the five elements ..."
        "I've given you 1300 cubic meters!"
        Yuan Shuo's expression was cold. He looked at him with some dissatisfaction.
        Hao lianchuan explained,"I really didn't take your money for myself. I don't think it's that bad!" "But you insist on having the same amount, so I can only give you this much. As for the other 300 cubic meters, I'll exchange them for attribute-less mysterious energy, which is more helpful to martial masters. What do you think?"
        Only then did Yuan Shuo nod his head. This was fine too.
        "That's it then. In addition, Liu Long came to my place this morning. He said that if you came, you should help him hold an opening ceremony ..."
        "I'm so busy, I don't have time to do this!"
        Hao lianchuan was so angry that he almost laughed."I have too many things to do. Do you think I have the time to help him?"
        You must be joking!
        "There are many snakes, insects, rats, and ants in the Silver City. Do you think he can suppress them with a hundred people?"
        Yuan Shuo replied calmly,"up to you. It's only the day after tomorrow. Since you're already here, are you rushing back now?"
        “……”
        Hao lianchuan thought for a while and was speechless. After a while, he said,""Alright! There shouldn't be any major events happening in the near future. I've already spoken to a few large organizations, so you can rest assured! The central region is chaotic, but it hasn't affected us yet. We'll talk about it after we've finished exploring the ruins. "
        "Yes."
        Yuan Shuo waved his hand to chase him away."That's enough, you can leave now."
        Hao lianchuan was even more speechless."I'm still a three yang."
        This guy was getting more and more arrogant!
        At this moment, he really did have the demeanor of old demon Yuan.
        He didn't bother to say anything more and left immediately. As for why Yuan Shuo wanted to exchange the five elements energy, he didn't bother to ask. He had some guesses in his heart. Last time, Yuan Shuo had asked him to absorb some energy from other elements, and he had done so. The effect was not bad.
        His chest pain seemed to have weakened a little, even though it didn't seem to be of much help to his strength.
        However, this matter was still rather important.
        Hao lianchuan was ready to test it out for a while. If there were no major problems, he would inform the night patrolmen to see if they could study it and see if a balance of the five elements was needed to better promote the progress of superpowers.
        It was also because Yuan Shuo had provided him with this information that he had been so enthusiastic. He had come immediately when Yuan Shuo had called for him.
        He walked out of the yuan family's courtyard and stopped in his tracks.
        He stepped on a broken tile, looked down, and raised his eyebrows.
         As a three-Sun Expert, he had a good eye.
        "The use of Shi?"
        He guessed that it didn't seem to be Yuan Shuo 's. Could it be Liu Long who came in the morning?
        In that case, Liu Long had also started to come into contact with Shi. This was not bad. It seemed that this guy might have the hope of entering the thousand warrior class.
        At this moment, Hao lianchuan smiled.
        It was an unexpected gain!
        No one told him about this, not even Liu Long himself. Could it be that he was planning to give the night patrolman a surprise after he advanced?
        "If he can advance ... That's not bad. It's worth it to hold the fort for him this time!"
        Hao lianchuan chuckled as he walked toward the inspection Office. He was in an exceptionally good mood.
        As for the silver Blizzard city, the others couldn't do much right now.
       
        30th of July.
        On the last day of July, Xingyuan calendar did not differentiate between large and small months. Each month had a standard 30 days.
        Today was a rest day. Be it the inspector or the night patrol, everyone had a rest day. There were six days of rest every month. Relatively speaking, eating a public meal was still very comfortable.
        Of course, when he was busy, he would not rest for the whole year.
        On this day, Li Hao woke up late.
        It wasn't that he was slacking off because he didn't go to work. After Yuan Shuo destroyed a mine last night, he came to Li Hao's room and scared him to death in the middle of the night. Then, he tormented Li Hao the entire night.
        The main thing was to feed him the mysterious energy!
        That was called forcing it. You had to suck it in no matter what, as long as you could.
        Yuan Shuo had prepared 1000 cubic meters of five elements energy for him.
        Li Hao had absorbed so much five elements energy that he almost vomited blood, yet he had only managed to absorb less than 100 cubic meters ... If this news were to spread, it would be terrifying.
         Who could absorb 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy in one night?
        Even a douqian Martial Master like Liu Long might not be able to absorb so much at this moment, mainly because he could not digest it.
        But Li Hao had sword energy.
        After the sword energy was neutralized, the energy would become gentle energy. Even if it could not be absorbed, it could still be stored in the body.
        However, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo both sensed that the sword energy was decreasing.
        As for the problem of the sword power decreasing, Yuan Shuo did not know how to deal with it. The origin god weapon was a top secret in the field of superpowers, but there was no such thing as an origin god weapon in the ancient records. It was probably a concept proposed by the modern supers.
        Absorbing 100 cubic meters ... Was enough for a person who broke through 100 to become a super. For example, Liu Yan, who broke through 100,100 cubic meters should be enough to advance.
        When Yuan Shuo had broken through to the great circle of one hundred, he had said that if he wanted to advance, he would only need a few hundred or a thousand cubic meters.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, had absorbed so much energy mainly to strengthen his five internal organs and his physical fitness.
        ,m As for the release of internal strength from the torso, Li Hao still needed to Polish it himself. It would take some time. In terms of physical fitness, even Yuan Shuo said that this guy's internal organs were not worse than his when he had broken through 100 perfection.  At that time, he had relied on his inner strength to nurture it. He didn't have Li Hao's conditions and had relied on his special ability to strengthen it.
        Thus, Li Hao got up a little late and felt very full.
        The feeling of eating too much!
        The branch's founding ceremony was tomorrow night, which was the night of August 1st. It was still early. It didn't matter if Li Hao didn't work today, nor did he care if he woke up a little late.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "A big house is good ... But it's a little inconvenient!"
        Li Hao, who was still digesting the information, felt a little emotional.
        This place was very good and comfortable, but it was a little bad. There was no place to eat breakfast. In the wealthy District, who would eat breakfast every day like Li Hao?
        Everyone had a nanny and chef.  Otherwise, he could get up in the morning, go out for a walk, eat some breakfast, exercise his body, and practice the five animal technique. It would be very good to maintain his health.
        At this moment, Li Hao grumbled. Then, he felt his body, only to feel that his internal organs were like a furnace.
        It was warm!
        His blood was flowing crazily, and every time it flowed, it would produce strands of inner strength. At the same time, it would strengthen some of his blood vessels, skin, bones, and bones.
        "Lightning body strengthening, wind speed increasing ..."
        Li Hao felt helpless when he thought of the Thunder energy.
        Ying Hongyue's son was of the lightning element, and Yuan Shuo had managed to extract some lightning energy after killing him. In the end, Huang Yun had taken half of the lightning energy, and the remaining bit had been exchanged for by the other party.
        Yuan Shuo had wanted to stay, but then he felt that the five-element energy was more important. Now, he had only exchanged the five-element energy for 1000 cubic meters, and Li Hao felt that he had lost out by getting 300 cubic meters of useless attribute-less mysterious energy.
        What could Huang Yun do with lightning?
        Wasn't he a wind-type?
        Attribute-less mysterious energy was indeed effective in strengthening martial masters, but attribute-less mysterious energy was not as precious as attribute-less mysterious energy to Li Hao.
        Despite his complaints, Li Hao started to practice his boxing.
        A lazy fist technique!
        This was the appearance of the five birds technique when it was not in battle. It was known as the number one technique of health maintenance, and the battle was not intense.
        At this moment, Li Hao could feel the increase in his inner strength and the strengthening of his flesh. He felt a strong sense of power.
        Of course, he didn't dare to use too much force, afraid that he would make too much noise and attract the attention of the house next door.
        He didn't know if Qiao Peng would still be in the mood to hook up with him today.
         The corner of Li Hao's mouth rose slightly. Last night, his family's mine had collapsed. In the middle of the night, Li Hao had sensed that Yue Ying, who had followed Qiao Peng, had gone out. The light source was very obvious in the middle of the night.
        However, in the morning, the other party returned. It seemed that the collapse of the mine was almost settled.
        When he said Qiao Peng, Qiao Peng arrived.
        Li Hao actually couldn't sense Qiao Peng's aura, nor could he sense Yue Ying's aura. However, the other party was a huge light bulb moving towards him. Li Hao wasn't blind, so he could still see it.
        Li Hao now concluded that this pair of all-seeing eyes should be due to his bloodline. There was no other explanation.
        But sometimes, Li Hao thought that the night patrollers seemed to have absorbed some of these people. Could it be that they were also of the bloodline of the eight great families?
        However, this was not logical. If the other party was also a descendant of the eight great families, that meant that the night patrol knew about it, so why didn't they know about the Silver City?
        These things were not good to ask directly.
        Wang Ming might know, but he wasn't too stupid. If he asked too much, Li Hao was worried that the guy would guess something.
        There was no rush in this matter. After this battle and forming a deep friendship, he would slowly ask. At that time, he would not be afraid.
       
        What happened to those who saw the red shadow?
        Also, was it a secret that the red shadow was in the higher-ups of the night patrollers?
        It might not be!
        Otherwise, how could the night watchman know that these people were special the moment they saw the Red Shadows?
        That's right. There were always some powerhouses with special abilities among the night watchers. Moreover, existences at the three suns might be able to see them directly ... It was just a guess. It was Li Hao's fault for not knowing friends at the three suns.
        As these thoughts flashed through his mind, he pretended not to see that fellow's arrival.
        Until someone knocked on the door of the courtyard.
        "Who is it?" Li Hao's voice was heard.
        "It's me, patrol li. Are you busy?"
        Outside the door, Qiao Peng and the driver were waiting.
         Soon, the door was opened. Li Hao frowned and looked at him coldly."Qiao Peng, I've told you, if you don't mess with me, I won't bother with you! What's the meaning of this so early in the morning?"
        "Don't misunderstand!"
        Qiao Peng laughed,"I really don't have any other intentions. Patrol li may have some misunderstandings about me. I'm here today because I have something to discuss with you."
        "What is it?"
        Li Hao had no intention of letting him in. He directly blocked the entrance of the courtyard.
        Qiao Peng wasn't angry at all. He explained,""It's like this. The Qiao's mining industry has a mine in Silver City. Patrol li went to see it the day before yesterday. You know about this, right?"
        "Of course!"
        "There was a collapse accident in the Qiao's mine last night ..."
        "Someone died?" Li Hao's eyes lit up.
        He looked at the other party and suddenly laughed,"you want me to help you settle it?" "Let's talk about how many people died first. If there are more than three people, you guys can go to the inspection Office to solve it yourselves. If there are less than three people, I don't like money, and money has no meaning ... I need mysterious energy!"
        “……”
        Qiao Peng was dumbfounded. Who said that this grandson was a good person?
        Oh my God!
        This fellow had only been an official for a few days, yet he had already learned how to ask for bribes.
        So he didn't have a chance to show off in the past?
        He really didn't expect that Li Hao would ask for money to settle the matter. He really didn't come for this.
        "No, no... The Qiao's are kind to their workers. They don't work at night. Last night, the collapse only caused the mine to collapse, but no one was hurt. From today on, the mine will be closed until the new well is built."
        At this point, Qiao Peng finally revealed his purpose,""It's like this. Professor Yuan is the most famous geologist in Silver City ..."
        "You want my teacher to help you open a new mine?" Li Hao asked.
        "It really isn 't!"
        "Professor Yuan is the strongest Man in Silver City now," Qiao Peng laughed. "I don't dare to trouble him with such a small matter! We all know that you're the professor's disciple, and that you've specialized in this field in the past. We've come today to ask for your help ..... Help us locate a new mine. "
         Li Hao frowned slightly.  His head quickly turned.
        He didn't expect that the Qiao family would actually ask him for help in the end. What did this mean?
        The Qiao's mining industry was a professional. Why would they lack an expert?
        p It really wasn't bad! This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It's not a difficult thing, the Qiao's are the professionals, why are you looking for me?
        This ... Was really strange.
        A moment later, Li Hao had some ideas.
        Find me!
        Damn, what help would it be to Mrs. Qiao?
        It was of no help!
        Not only was it of no help, but he also had to be careful not to discover anything. But Qiao Peng still came ...
        Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. A relic!  He roughly understood the Qiao family's intentions. Perhaps the collapse of the mine was not worth paying attention to at all to the Qiao family, but if they could use this opportunity to let him go to the mine, and if his bloodline could stir up some movement in the remains ... It would be a huge matter for the Qiao family.
        Perhaps ... He wanted to kill him?
        Li Hao took a deep breath.
        It was not impossible!
        The silver Blizzard city had attracted a lot of attention, and so had Li Hao. Ordinary reasons for him to go to the mine were not very reliable. He had gone there the day before yesterday, but he had gone with a Nightwatch. Many people knew about it and had been watching.
        If he used the excuse of exploring the mine today to invite him to help in private, the others might not care.
        Yuan Shuo was an expert in this industry, and Li Hao was his favorite student. It was reasonable for a big company like the Qiao's mining company to ask Li Hao for help.
        I'm afraid ... I won't be able to come back!
         Qiao Feilong might kill him, make a fortune, clear the ruins, and run away. At that time, even if they were exposed, they wouldn't be afraid.
        "It's dangerous!"
        At this thought, Li Hao instantly smelled danger.
        The Qiao family might really take the opportunity to kill him.
        It was no wonder that despite knowing that it was a relic and their secret, he still took the initiative to invite Li Hao to help ... He definitely had ill intentions.
        Thinking of all this, Li Hao looked troubled.
        "Don't let patrol li come for nothing. If you need star currency or mysterious energy, we can discuss it ..."Qiao Peng said in a low voice.
        "I didn't learn my teacher's skills!"
        Li Hao frowned."Besides, it's just setting up a new mine. Does your Qiao's group lack such people?"
        Qiao Peng helplessly said,"we don't lack for experts. To be honest, if it's possible, we would like to have our own people settle it. However, the location of the collapse isn't very good. Our experts are all old people, and they aren't skilled enough. We hope to find an expert who can quickly determine the location and restart the mine ... In Silver City, only inspector li and professor Yuan are suitable, but professor Yuan ... I really can't afford to hire him!"
       
        Qiao Peng laughed bitterly."He's a warrior master, a God of the land. How much should we pay him for this?" The value of our Qiao's mines is there, we can't bear to give too much, and the professor won't be satisfied if we give too little ... After thinking about it, inspector li should have learned about 80% of the professor's knowledge, and that's enough!"
        This reason was really well thought out.
        Why didn't he look for Yuan Shuo? that was because Yuan Shuo was too expensive.
        Why did she look for Li Hao? it was because Li Hao was a fighter among experts. He was good, fast, convenient, and didn't procrastinate.
        ? "Then how much are you guys offering?" Li Hao raised his eyebrows.
        "One mysterious energy, or 1 million star dollars!"
        "This price is definitely fair!" Qiao Peng said seriously.
        Li Hao was disappointed."Forget it. My monthly salary already has a mysterious ability. I thought that the Qiao family was rich and powerful. In the end, it's only this little?"
        Qiao Peng cursed in his heart!
        I'd like to offer you 10 or 100 cubic meters, but I'm afraid you won't dare to accept it!
         Besides, I'm only asking you to explore it. I've given you so much, and you're still not satisfied?
        This fellow was far greedier than the rumors had said.
        "Investigator li, it's really not a small amount. It's not that the Qiao family can't pay a higher price ... But to be honest, it's not worth it to pay too much. Even if we can resume work tomorrow, the Qiao family will have to pay a higher price ... Then ... Then we might as well wait a few days."
        "It'll only take one or two days at most to get one cubic meter of mysterious energy,"Qiao Peng added." Inspector li, just ask if the price we're offering is fair or not. "
        Li Hao seemed to be moved. He thought for a moment, then nodded and said,""Okay, then wait for me ... I'll go now?"
        "Right, the faster the better!"
        Qiao Peng quickly nodded. He couldn't wait for Li Hao to follow him.
        As for taking him away by force ... Forget it. There might be people in the city keeping an eye on them. Besides, they were too close to Yuan Shuo.
        In addition, if Li Hao was taken away by force, the Silver City would definitely explode.
        He had to make the other party follow him willingly!
        By the time they reached the mine, the others might have already figured out their goal. They were only here to explore a new mine. At that time, they would enter the mine, and the others would not rashly enter to investigate.
        The father and son of the Qiao family had a good plan.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This time, he had some special plans. If Li Hao approached the remains and something really happened ... He could either kill Li Hao on the spot or find a way to get some of Li Hao's blood at the mine.
        In short, the Qiao family had to confirm Li Hao's role.
        If nothing happened and the blood had no effect, then killing Li Hao would be equivalent to offending someone for nothing. It would also expose the secret that he had been hiding for many years. The gains did not make up for the losses.
        In short, he didn't call Li Hao over this time because he didn't plan to return empty-handed.
        At the very least, Li Hao had to leave some blood behind.
        And in the mine, it was also the least noticeable method.
        The mine had just collapsed, so there was a lot of rubble. Li Hao was only in the tenth slash realm, so it was very common for some rocks to break his skin.
         â€¦â€¦  Li Hao didn't waste any time. He directly entered the house, changed his clothes, and quickly left the courtyard.
        She had just walked out of the door and got into the Qiao family's car.
        The communicator in his hand suddenly rang. Li Hao picked up the call. Qiao Peng, who was in the front row, tilted his head to eavesdrop on Li Hao's conversation.
        "Li Hao!"
        "Boss, what's the matter?"
        Qiao Peng raised his eyebrows.
        "Minister Hao has come from white moon City. He said that he will help us host the branch establishment ceremony tomorrow. If you have time, please come over and meet Hao bu!"
        "Now?"
        "Yes, the sooner the better."
        "That ..."
        Li Hao hesitated."Boss, why don't you wait for a while? or you can just drive to the Qiao's mine and wait for me at the entrance. I'll go and set up a new mine for the Qiao's mining right now. It'll be done soon."
        "What nonsense are you talking about!"
        "Hao bu is waiting for you!" Liu Long shouted angrily,"you're going out to earn some extra money?"
        "No, that's not what I meant ..."
        Li Hao explained,"our Inspection Office also has the responsibility to help deal with some cases. The collapse of the mine was a safety accident in the first place. I mainly went to investigate and see if the Qiao's had concealed the casualties. Boss, I'm busy with official business."
        "Nonsense! Hurry up and come back!"
        Li Hao, however, was a little reluctant. He gritted his teeth and said,""Boss, it's just an hour ... I'll go over as soon as I'm done. I promised someone and we're almost there. Boss ... I ... I'm lacking in mystical energy. "
        â€œè‰¹!â€
         Liu Long cursed,"if you weren't Yuan Shuo's F * cking student, I would have slapped you to death!" Just you wait, I'll drive there right away, so you'd better get it done quickly. Li Hao, you've read too much! Don't think that you can do anything just because you're Yuan Shuo's student. Hao bu is here, and you still dare to do this ... I really didn't see this before!"
        "What a coincidence!"
        Li Hao hurriedly explained, but Liu Long had already hung up.
        Li Hao felt helpless and couldn't help but curse in a low voice. He then looked at Qiao Peng in front of him and said angrily,""Look, because of you, chief Liu scolded me. Qiao Peng, I don't care what, it'll take at most an hour. It'll be best if we can locate it, if not ... You'll have to pay!"
        At that moment, Qiao Peng was about to curse!
        He was about to explode from anger.
        Liu Long is going too?
        Hao lianchuan was here?
        Once Liu Long left, Li Hao would also be there. Wouldn't people immediately pay attention to them?
        If Hao lianchuan were to pay attention to them ... Then they would have to be extra careful. If they brought Li Hao and Liu Long over and attracted their attention, they might be exposed.
       
        "Don 't, patrol li. Let's forget about it today. Don't let chief Liu make a trip. We'll meet again when we have time."
        If Liu Long were to go, then the plan would be ruined.
        Rest early, what's there to go.
        Li Hao frowned."Cut the crap. I've already been scolded. If I don't ask boss to go now, wouldn't I be asking for a scolding?" Chief Liu takes good care of me. I'm short of mysterious energy anyway, and spending an hour to earn one ... Boss won't mind. He's just scolding me. "
        As he spoke, he glanced at Qiao Peng and laughed to himself.
        I'll make you suffer!
        Liu Long's message came at such a timely time because Li Hao had just entered to change his clothes and greeted him in advance. Since Mrs. Qiao was so polite and warmly invited him, there was no harm in going.
        If he didn't go, it would make people suspicious.
        Liu Long followed ... He wanted to see if Liu Long could sense anything, and if he could check out the specific attributes, abilities, and strength of the three superpowers.
        Martial masters were good at concealing themselves, but they were super-powered. Especially at the radiant sun realm, Liu Long should be able to sense something since he was so close to Martial Master Dou Qian.
         He was just worried that he didn't understand his opponent well!
        This was a good opportunity. Otherwise, Liu Long, the head of the night patrol branch, would have no reason to go there.
        Although Yuan Shuo was there last night, what he sensed might not be the same as what Liu Long sensed.
        Perhaps Yuan Shuo felt that Liu Long could be dealt with, but that was only for him. It also depended on Liu Long's own feelings.
        â€¦â€¦
        At the same time.
        Liu Long Drove his carriage towards the mine, feeling extremely strange in his heart.
        He was really ... A good person who came to his door.
        Was the Qiao family in such a hurry to die?
        He had wanted to sneak into the mine to take a look, but he was worried that he was not as good at hiding as Yuan Shuo. If he was discovered, he would be in deep trouble.
        Now was the perfect time to go and take a look openly.
        He drove very fast, just like his personality, Swift and decisive.
        Before Li Hao's group arrived, he had already arrived.
        Because of the collapse of Mrs. Qiao's mine, there were very few people left in the mine at the moment. Liu Long arrived, but he didn't go in. He just stood at the entrance of the mine, got out of the car, and lit a cigarette.
        When someone stepped forward, Liu Long said indifferently,""I'm Liu Long!"
        The person who came out had a change in expression.
        The next moment, Liu Long asked again,"where's Li Hao?" Tell him to come out quickly!"
        The people who were left behind were naturally the mine's higher-ups. When they heard this, they quickly said,""Liu...Captain Liu, I don't think patrol li is here. Are you looking for him?"
        "Right!"
        Liu Long frowned,"he didn't come?" He's playing with me?"
        Then, he frowned and stared at the person in front of him with a cold face,""I heard there was a landslide here. Did anyone die?â€œ
        "No, I'm really not ..."  The person in charge quickly explained, his face full of fear.
        There weren't many people in the Silver City who weren't afraid of this man. He was the Big Brother of the law enforcement team ... He wasn't one anymore, but most people didn't know about this.
        As they were talking, a car stopped.
        "Boss, how did you get here faster than me?" Li Hao was delighted.
        Qiao Peng, who got out of the car as well, really wanted to curse in his heart.
        You're really fast!
        "Cut the crap!"
        Liu Long also saw them, but he ignored Qiao Peng and frowned at the driver. He looked a little uncertain, then looked at Li Hao,""Hurry up, Hao bu is still waiting!"
        "You're a superhuman?"he pointed at the driver.
        "Have you registered?" he asked with a sharp gaze.
        "No," the middle-aged driver replied softly."I'm just preparing to register with the night patrol tomorrow."
        Qiao Peng also explained,"this is the bodyguard my father hired for me. I didn't hide it from the night patrol. I was going to register him before ..."
        "Shut up, you're not in a position to speak!"
        Liu Long's eyes were cold as he snorted,"Register early!"
        He didn't say much. Everyone knew that he was hiding something from the supers.
        Qiao Peng knew that he was here, but he still brought his driver. On one hand, Li Hao was in the car, so it was inconvenient to change the driver. On the other hand, he wanted to test the night patrolman and see if he knew anything about the Qiao 's.
        From Liu Long's performance ... There shouldn't be any problem.
        Otherwise, Liu Long would have pretended to be deaf and mute.
        Qiao Peng may have looked like a Playboy, but he was not without schemes. Every step he took was calculated. The driver's exposure was not an accident, but on purpose.
        After all, in such a big Mrs. Qiao, it didn't even have a Dark Moon or a hundred people, which was not in line with the status of Mrs. Qiao.
        Liu Long didn't want to waste his breath. He frowned and said,"I don't care what you agreed on. Li Hao, hurry up. I'll go with you. Get it done quickly!"
         Then, he glanced at the driver and said,""If this guy stays here, and I stay here, who would dare to harm you, the young master of the Qiao family?"
        As he spoke, there was a hint of mockery in his voice."Keep a low profile! Don't think that you can do whatever you want just because you have money. In the past, I was too lazy to care and didn't have the power to care, but it's different now!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I understand, I understand!"
        "Chief Liu, why don't you sit here for a while? it's been hard on patrol li, he'll be out soon ..." Qiao Peng quickly nodded.
        "No need, let's go together!"
        Liu Long was incomparably cold and arrogant."With the Qiao family's status, you should understand that Li Hao is still in great danger. Better to be safe than sorry. If someone is hiding in the mine and is harmful to him, the Qiao's can not afford to take responsibility!"
        Qiao Peng cursed in his heart.
        He was really unlucky this time.
        If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have acted so smart and insisted on inviting Li Hao ... Alright, even Liu Long was drawn here.
        How troublesome!
       
        As for killing Liu Long as well ... Forget it. Hao lianchuan was in the city, and there was also Yuan Shuo. If they turned against each other now, it would be very easy for problems to arise.
        It seemed that he could only give up on the plan.
        It was better to send this pair of gods of plague away as soon as possible.
        He didn't dare to say anything more, nor did he dare to delay. He quickly led the two people towards the collapsed mine area.
        As for Liu Long, he didn't say anything and followed Li Hao with his arms crossed.
        He walked into the mine openly!
        The moment he stepped into the mine, he vaguely felt something. Three extremely weak Auras ... If he hadn't stepped into the universe, he wouldn't have been able to sense them at all.
        At this moment, he could vaguely sense it. If he had not known in advance, he might have ignored it.
        From this, it could be seen that the Qiao family was really good at hiding.
        Could these three people be like Qiao Feilong, hiding a treasure that could conceal their aura?
         But even so, what he sensed was extremely weak.
        Therefore, either the other party had superpowers, or they were in an extraordinary place. Their aura was isolated, or maybe ... They were isolated by ice crystals!
        Thinking of this, Liu Long's eyes suddenly lit up.
        Could this be the case?
        The ice crystal could indeed hide one's aura, but once that happened, it meant that the other party would find it difficult to use all their powers within the range of the ice crystal.
        Of course, under normal circumstances, ice crystals were fragile. If one wanted to break them, it would actually be very fast. It would only take an instant.
        However ... As long as he seized this opportunity, it might be of great use.
        "Is it an ice crystal? Or is it the relic effect that Li Hao and the others mentioned?"
        He judged in his heart that there was a high probability that it was an ice crystal!
        The Qiao family might not have really entered the ruins. If it wasn't fully opened, then there was an 80 to 90 percent chance that it was ice crystals.
        "The heavens are helping me!"
        At this moment, Liu Long was also very excited. If this was the case, he could sneak over in advance and catch the other party off guard. Before the ice crystals shattered, he might be able to get rid of the three sunlit Warriors in advance!
        This trip was worth it!
        But very quickly, his feeling disappeared.
        Because the collapsed area was quite far away from that place, the sense gradually weakened until it could no longer be sensed.
        This also allowed Liu Long to confirm that the chances of it being covered in ice crystals were higher.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, was not idle. He looked around.
        In fact, he had been observing the three orbs of light the whole time, observing their specific strengths and weaknesses. Using Huang Yun as a comparison, this was also the most direct observation. This way, he might be able to determine the specific strength of the three people.
         He looked at the special colors in the light balls ... If they were supers with common attributes, he might be able to see their attributes.  Soon, they arrived at a collapsed area.
        Li Hao had some real skills. He observed the surroundings and moved very quickly.
        Soon, Li Hao jumped up from the ground.""It's simple. We don't need to open a new mine. Just clean it up and we can go back to work in eight to ten days! Opening a new mine might take even longer. "
        "In order to prevent a second collapse, it's best to send people to clean up the scene after three days!"
        Li Hao said in a deep voice,"don't ignore human lives!" It's good that the Qiao's are rich, but they're all local. There's the risk of a second landslide here, it's best to wait a few days, wait until it's completely stable, then clean it up, understand? I'll keep an eye on you guys, so don't mess around. You don't want sister Liu to remember anything unpleasant because of this, so don't blame me for not giving you face!"
        "Of course not!" Qiao Peng quickly replied. Are you sure you don't want to open a new mine, investigator li?"
        "One hundred percent!"
        Li Hao said proudly,"although I'm not as good as my teacher, I can understand this kind of small problem with one look!" You invited me ... I can only say that it's a waste of money. Others can see it too, but your Qiao family is big and rich, so you don't care. "
        "That's different. I'm much more at ease now that you've said that, inspector li ......"
        "If you're done, then come with me now; what are you waiting for?" Liu Long said impatiently;
        Li Hao chuckled and nodded. He then looked at Qiao Peng.
        "I'll send someone to deliver it to him when he returns tonight. It's not convenient to bring it with me right now,"Qiao Peng quickly said.
        "I don't think you would dare to take my money!"
        Li Hao laughed and didn't say anything. He followed Liu Long outside.
        Qiao Peng walked them all the way to the outside of the mine, and only let out a sigh of relief after the two of them got into the car.
        He could not help but curse when the car drove away!
        "I almost succeeded!"
         "Damn it!" He cursed. What a coincidence that Liu Long came running over.
        Soon, he thought of something and quickly looked at the driver beside him. He whispered,""Go and ask if there's any special situation."
        He was a little regretful that he didn't get Li Hao's blood.
        However, he didn't know if Li Hao's arrival would affect the other side.
        The driver didn't say anything and quickly disappeared.
        â€¦â€¦
        At the same time.
        In the car.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Liu Long Drove for a long distance before he said in a low voice,"The aura is weak and hard to sense, but it should be sunlit without a doubt. There is a faint flame aura rising, possibly fire element!"
        Li Hao nodded. He had also seen some fiery red."I think there are two fire elements. The other one might be earth or wood ... I'm not too sure." My teacher went to see them last night, and he told me that the three of them should all be slightly weaker than Huang Yun ... It's the wind element Night Watcher from last time. "
       
        "Your teacher ... Is really strong!"
        Liu Long sighed with emotion. He could only sense a little bit of things, but he did not expect Yuan Shuo to see so much last night. He had even detected Yuan Shuo's strength. Yuan Shuo was truly a God!
        "Huang Yun is at the mid-stage of the sunlit realm. This means that there are three early stage sunlit realm cultivators here, or close to the mid-stage sunlit realm ... Anyway, it's best if they don't surpass Huang Yun!"
        "Did your teacher say that their aura was concealed because of the remains, or because of the ice crystals?"
        This ... Yuan Shuo had never mentioned this before!
        Of course, Li Hao didn't care. Not only that, but he also didn't mention anything else. Last night, his teacher didn't investigate at all, afraid that he would be discovered.
        He judged for a moment and said,"it might be the effect of the ice crystals. The ruins are very strong and won't be too fragile!" Ice crystals are weaker. The collapse last night might have caused some cracks to appear in the ice crystals, causing some power to leak out. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been able to sense it. "
        Li Hao said this because he saw some mysterious energy leaking out of the light, not the feeling of being surrounded, so it was probably caused by a small crack in the ice crystal.
        This time, Liu Long was confident.
        There was no need to doubt Yuan Shuo's words.
         "I've pretty much investigated your strength and attributes. What a coincidence today, the Qiao family actually invited you to explore the mine. Something must have gone wrong with your brain!"
        Liu Long laughed.
        Li Hao pursed his lips. Did water enter his brain?
        It wasn't that he was in the water, but that he was thinking of something good.
        If you're not here, the Qiao family will most likely kill me.
        "Then now ..."
        "To see Minister Kuang. Do you think I'm joking?"
        Liu Long looked at him in surprise. You're a Deputy Minister of a branch. What are you thinking if you don't meet your boss?
        Li Hao thought for a moment, nodded, and said,""What's Minister kui's three yang level?"
        "It's hard to say,"
        "Boss, you don't know?"
        "How would I know?"
        Liu Long shook his head.
        However, Li Hao was thinking that he should be able to determine Qiao Feilong's realm with Hao lianchuan as a standard. Was he at the peak of the radiant sun realm, the early stage of the three yang realm, or even stronger?
        In his vision, Qiao Feilong's ball of light was slightly weaker than Hao lianchuan 's, but not by much. It was also slightly weaker than Broken Sky' s, but not by much.
        â€¦â€¦
        The car quickly stopped at the law enforcement building.
        Li Hao also saw Hao lianchuan again, the expert who had been called by his teacher to be a backup.
        Hao lianchuan looked rather familiar.
        He was also smiling very kindly.
        When he saw Li Hao, he first praised him, expressing his concern for Li Hao, and then briefly explained the difficulties of the night patrolmen. The sword patrolmen of the Li family would give him the items, but he would need some time.
        It was a typical bureaucratic tone!
        Li Hao didn't mind. After Hao lianchuan talked for a while, Li Hao suddenly said,""Hao bu, my teacher said you're very strong. He could kill Duan Tian, but he might not be a match for Hao bu ... My teacher said that Duan Tian's strength is not considered strong among the three suns, and Hao bu is stronger than him. Could Hao bu be at the mid-stage of the three suns?"
        To ask someone about their strength in person ... Especially when they were of a lower level, was very impolite and very unruly!
        However, the one asking the question was Li Hao, a student who had yet to graduate ...
        Furthermore, the other party was Yuan Shuo's student. The key was that he said that his teacher had praised him and said that he might not be a match for him.
        Anyone would like to hear praise!
        Hao lianchuan was no exception. He immediately smiled and didn't feel displeased by Li Hao's words.
        Liu Long, on the other hand, frowned slightly and said,"Li Hao, be more obedient!" Don't ask what you shouldn't ask! Hao bu was only in the sun glory realm before, so even if he entered the three yang realm, he should only be in the early stage of the three yang realm. How could he enter the middle stage so quickly?"
        Hao lianchuan frowned.
        He didn't like to hear this.
        Although it was the truth!
        He wasn't too satisfied, but Liu Long was a straightforward person, so he didn't say anything.  He smiled and said,"I'm fine!" Children were full of curiosity. "Li Hao, just like what your Department Liu said, I'm also only at the early stage of the three suns ... Of course, if we follow your middle to late stages, I'm indeed at the early stage. There's nothing to hide about this. It's just that the three suns are still far from you, so there's not much point in saying this."
        Li Hao nodded, a look of yearning on his face.""Three yang ... Is already very powerful! If even the teacher said that Hao bu was powerful, then someone who could be praised by the teacher must be extremely powerful! Hao bu, I really hope that one day, I can be as intimidating as Hao bu!"
        "You'll have a chance, you're still young. "
        Hao lianchuan's smile was bright. This sentence really made sense!
        'Yuan Shuo, Oh Yuan Shuo, you're arrogant, but your student has exposed everything. So You Think I'm strong behind my back?'
        What an innocent child!
        If your teacher heard this, I'm afraid he'll give you a good beating.
        For a Martial Master to be envious of a superhuman like himself was the greatest failure for Yuan Shuo. He had killed three suns, but in the eyes of his disciple, he was still inferior to him. How satisfying!
        Li Hao also smiled shyly and quickly said,""Then I won't bother Hao bu anymore. Hao bu is very busy every day, and I'm already very satisfied to be able to see him! I'll take my leave first!"
        "Mm, work hard and strive to become a superhuman as soon as possible. The environment in Whitemoon city is better than this. I hope to see you there soon!"
        Li Hao smiled and nodded. He didn't leave with Liu Long, but left alone.
        But in his heart, he was thinking that Qiao Feilong was only at the early stage of the three yang realm, but he was still slightly weaker than Hao lianchuan. Teacher should be able to deal with him, right?
        In the office.
        Hao lianchuan praised Li Hao for a while more and said with a smile,""Educated people are indeed different. They are educated and reasonable. In this aspect, Yuan Shuo can't be compared to them. That guy is very hypocritical and is not a good person in essence. Fortunately, his student is different from him."
        Liu Long felt helpless. "Good fellow, is this all you, Hao lianchuan, can do?"
        However, Li Hao was too good at confusing people.
        To be honest, this was the first time he saw Li Hao's shy smile. He also felt that this child was too innocent and shouldn't be involved in such dangerous matters.
        Of course, he didn't think so anymore.
        That little fellow was a fraud, no different from Yuan Shuo.
        Liu Long didn't say much and just said a few perfunctory words before quickly saying,"Then, the founding ceremony will be held tomorrow. The others and I will come later."
        "What?"
        Hao lianchuan was stunned. How could this be?
        The master was late and wanted him to go first. What was going on?
        Liu Long explained,"the night watchers division has been established. Hao bu knows about our Demon Hunter team's situation. Liu Yan and the others want us to pay respects to the Demon Hunters who died in battle before the opening ceremony. It's not appropriate for Hao bu to go ..."
        "I ..."
        Hao lianchuan sighed and nodded.""I should! Speaking of which, these people are all good. It's just that ... The night patrolmen also had their difficulties before, you know that. "
        "Yes, we have no complaints!"
        Liu Long said calmly,"Li Hao said that we're the night patrollers now. Scolding the night patrollers is the same as scolding ourselves. So, there's no need to blame anyone. It's all our own choice!"
        Hearing this, Hao lianchuan couldn't help but sigh. What a good child!
        These words could only be said by cultured people. Liu Long didn't have such a standard.
        "Then you guys go and hold the memorial ceremony. I'll help host it first. When you guys come, it'll be officially established!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I'll have to trouble Hao bu!"
         Liu Long replied politely. Hao lianchuan smiled and said,""You're welcome, it's my duty!"
        Both parties exchanged a few more words before Liu Long turned around and left.
        Tomorrow, Hao lianchuan would be hosting the ceremony here ... If no one came, it would not cause Hao lianchuan to be dissatisfied or suspicious. This was good.
        Perhaps he would still have time to attend the banquet after killing everyone.
        â€¦â€¦
        After Liu Long left, Hao lianchuan thought for a while and felt that something was wrong ... But he couldn't put his finger on what it was.
        Forget it, it's fine with me here.
        He was just a little puzzled. Did he need to take Wang Ming and the others with him?
        "It's good that they've brought them along. It means that Liu Long and the others have accepted these people ... It's a good thing!"
        When he thought of this, he smiled, revealing a gratified smile. Being able to merge together was naturally the best result.
