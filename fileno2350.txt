He fell into the river and felt the powerful scouring force in the water. It was like using a sword to cut your body bit by bit. It was not the kind that could kill you with one sword.It was even more painful than enduring the longevity sword intent.Li Hao grunted and said in a deep voice,"it's a little beyond my expectations. It's also because of senior's strong defense. A weak force can't wash through senior's body. That's the only way ..."Li Hao gasped for breath."Only in this way can the cleansing be successful!" He said.Shitou wailed in pain."You ... Just get out. I can do it!"Li Hao exhaled and quickly said,""There's no need for that. I'd like to personally sense the changes in the flow of the river water in case there's an imbalance in the power and senior can't bear it, causing the forging to fail!""This is pain, but also ... Opportunity! Senior, you're just a stone, not a natural spirit stone ... You're a relatively ordinary stone. This time, I'll definitely be able to wash away all the impurities in your body! This time ... I'll establish senior's ... Invincible posture!"Li Hao exhaled. It was really F * cking painful!But ... I'm a person who cares about my face. Even if it hurts, I can't Shout!When no one was around, it was fine.Now, in their eyes, I'm just the second revered sword artist. How can I lose face?A Silver Moon Martial master's reputation was greater than the heavens!If he wanted face, he could give up his life!Shitou kept screaming and said intermittently,""Can ... Can I really be invincible?"Li Hao was also trying to divert his attention. He was also cleansing himself and comprehending the Dao. He smiled, but it was a bit ugly."Of course! This is the core power of the Silver Moon, and all its people have gathered ..."He paused, took a breath, and said, "It's equivalent to ... Using the great Dao universe to lay the foundation for senior! When you succeed, you'll be a natural spirit stone with the foundation of the world, and in the future ... You'll probably become the master of the world ... There's nowhere you can't go in this big world!""Really?""It's true!""But ... Ah ... It's so painful!""Only by suffering in pain can one rise above others ..."Li Hao replied, his voice a little awkward. It's too F * cking painful. Why didn't I feel it before?Black dust was gradually washed away from the giant rocks in the river. Li Hao did not lie. It was rare to have such an opportunity.Of course, the prerequisite was that you could withstand it!This thing could even wash away the blood essence of venerable sovereigns, so one could imagine how powerful it was.Seeing that the Shitou's screams were getting weaker and weaker, Li Hao suddenly shouted,""Senior stone, do you know that I once mastered time?""What ... What ...""I once saw the future in the universe of the great path ...""What ...""In the future ... There will be a rock that will suppress the heavens and earth! With one stone, the heavens and earth will collapse, the world will shatter ... I can know the past and the future! In the future, there will be a stone venerate who will be invincible in the primordial chaos and dominate the chaosverse!""That rock ... And senior ... How similar are they?""Re ... Really?" "Of course!"  Best novel online free at‚Äã ùïüùï†ùïßùïñùïùùïìùïöùïü  Li Hao laughed out loud, but his laughter was shrill. I've seen that stone suppress many worlds! I've seen that stone ... It created its own universe and world ... It's incredible!""I used to think, how could the future be like this? The Silver Moon did not have any stone demons. The future was all fake! When I saw you, senior, I was wondering if it was true. In the future ... Will senior be this powerful?",m "Is he really that strong?" Shitou shrieked. Then ... Is he stronger than the sword Saint?""Stronger ...""You're lying to me ...""No... Venerable the sword might not be within my scope of observation. From the looks of it, if I'm a little stronger ... Venerable the sword will become stronger too!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe man and the stone conversed non-stop. Li Hao made up a story and began to trick the stone.It wasn't just the stone. He continued,"it's just that ... I didn't understand at that time. Now I understand. I saw a tree in the stone on that stone, but I didn't see senior sword seal ... Now that I think about it, maybe senior sword seal is in the world in the stone!"On the outside, the sword tree and sword seal looked at each other.Just the three of us, can we smash the Crimson Moon universe with a rock?Who are you trying to fool?Li Hao laughed heartily."If you don't believe me, I'll show you. Watch me extend time, explore the future, and get the fruit of the future!"Suddenly, the power of time flowed through the river!Li Hao reached out his hand and made a grabbing motion. With a boom, the world trembled and the river churned. The next moment, it was as if the future had really appeared in another world.A huge rock suddenly broke a Red Moon with a blow!"Future?"Third Saint was shocked. He could vaguely see a tree on the rock!It was unbelievable!Bang! Bang!The shadow exploded, and Li Hao instantly seemed to be extremely weak. "Didn't I say ... It would work? Senior stone, did you see that?""I ... I saw it!""Hahaha!"In an instant, the huge rock in the river burst out with a brilliant light. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a flowing liquid!"In the future, I'll be invincible ... Li Hao, I'm going to establish the foundation of invincibility!"BOOM!The giant rock was flowing in the river. At this moment, it seemed to have become one with the river, and the rock was still crying out in excitement.At this moment ... Was it really important whether it was real or fake?

Chapter 2351 The Firmament Sword, The Spirit Sea
Third Saint might be slow-witted, but he wasn't an idiot.Li Hao ... Could he really get the future?It didn't matter if he believed it or not ... Since he saw it, he believed it.I believe it!The sword tree and the sword seal were also shouting as if they were saying that they would still be together in the future and that they would still be invincible!Li Hao revealed a faint smile ... Did they believe him?I don't know.But no matter what, we're still fighting, aren't we?As the rock exploded with a strong desire to live, the river started to shake. Drops of rock liquid merged into the river and gradually covered the entire River.The stone's weak voice continued to ring out,""Little pain ... How can I be strong without suffering ... I am the venerable of stone! Chaotic world ... Shi Zun crushes!"Seeing this, Li Hao exhaled and shouted,""Senior sword tree! Take root in the river!" The sword tree instantly appeared and revealed its true form. Thousands of roots took root in the river. The intense pain even caused its roots to tremble, tremble, and all its roots were trembling.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly burst out with a powerful sword intent, as if he was tearing the sky apart!Li Hao said softly,'today, I'll forge my sea of spirit and accept my bright moon sword! I will break the Stargate, step into the chaos, and break the firmament with my sword! This sword ... Is no longer the starry sky sword. It is ... The firmament sword!"BOOM!Heaven and earth trembled, and the universe shook."Today, I will no longer use the starry sky sword. The sword in my hand will only break the heavens!The sky was torn apart!A universe of the great path seemed to appear in front of him. However, it was faintly discernible and was about to break but not yet!"Take root in the barrier!" Li Hao shouted again."Senior sword seal, cover the area and seal the world. Leave ... A root passage ..."The sword seal instantly turned into a huge seal that suppressed the world and covered the entire area, including the long river.At this moment, the water of the long river flowed around the sword seal and started to shake.The three saints all screamed in pain!"It hurts!"The heart-wrenching pain hit them all the time, making them feel pain that they had never felt before. However, they did not break because they had once endured the thousand-year sword intent of the sword Saint.This was their most powerful confidence and capital!Only they could contain the long river. Otherwise, no one could withstand it.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, in the eight trigrams Formation.Vaguely, he seemed to hear some painful wails. Red Moon sovereign's ears perked up slightly, but he could only hear some faint screams. What was going on?After Li Hao entered, he had a lot of things to do.He didn't stop for a day!Could it be ... That this guy was dealing with those Small Saints?Was he eating them?Or something else?He wanted to take a look ... But he couldn't get out of the array, and his power couldn't seep out. Forget it, he didn't want to see it!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Void Dao universe.The sword-carrying man was repairing some stars. A bright moon was almost completely repaired by him. Suddenly, he frowned slightly and looked in one direction. Soon, he teleported to the depths of the universe. After silently observing for a while, he frowned slightly.Was there an unforeseen event?Someone was invading the void Dao universe?Red Moon sovereign?Or Li Hao?  Best novel online free at‚Äã ùïüùï†ùïßùïñùïùùïìùïöùïü  Or something else?He waited in silence, but ... There were only the stars shaking and the power of the great Dao rolling. Nothing else happened.He wanted to tear open the void and go out to take a look, but he was also worried that the other party might really invade him if he didn't manage to lock onto his position.After a moment of hesitation, the universe seemed to have calmed down.He looked at it silently for a while, remembering the location. Just as he was thinking about tearing it apart to take a look, suddenly, the power of the great Dao seeped out from many places, and the power of the great Dao rumbled.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Li Hao shouted,"don't root in one place. Senior sword tree, spread out!" They were rooted in various strongholds to avoid being detected by the enemy! After taking root ... The roots will enter the barrier!"BOOM!The great Dao universe seemed to be disappearing. Li Hao drew his sword and slashed again!The void split open again!Li Hao's entire body trembled. The next moment, he flew out and gritted his teeth."Now ... I'm going to let this spirit sea enter my brain! The three of you ... Don't shake and maintain as much stability as possible. Otherwise ... I'm in danger of dying!""Come!""Sure!""Don't worry!"The three Supreme Saints shouted at the same time.Li Hao didn't say anything. A rune that looked like a red mole appeared on his forehead."Open!" Li Hao shouted.His forehead instantly turned dark!Open the brain directly!At this moment, Li Hao's body expanded limitlessly. Gradually, his body grew so strong that the black hole on his forehead could contain his entire spirit sea. Li Hao reached out his hand, and his spirit sea was forcibly pulled into his brain."Seal!"The 'Dao' text trembled violently, and 122 giant Dragons appeared. They surrounded the' Dao' text and started to seal it, forcefully pulling this world into it!Boom! Boom! Boom!Li Hao's head trembled violently!Suddenly, waves of sword intent burst out from his brain, breaking through his mind and staining the void with blood.Li Hao was in great pain!He forcefully suppressed the numerous sword intents and hollered once more,""I'll merge the sword intent and stabilize the world. The three of you ... Bear with it!"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the man-made world in his mind, a sword intent suddenly appeared.A sword intent beyond the ten swords!It was also from Li Hao's comprehension of the longevity sword. However, his body was not strong enough and his sword intent was strong enough, so it was not easy for him to display it. Today, it appeared instantly and turned into a destructive aura.

Chapter 2352 The Firmament Sword, The Spirit Sea
BOOM!The long sword pierced through the void and with a loud boom, it seemed to have hit the barrier of the sword seal. The sword seal let out a muffled groan!It hurt!And this was only the first one. Gradually, more and more sword intents emerged. There was Destruction Sword intent, shattering sword intent, space splitting sword intent, life sword intent ...The rays of sword light gradually merged into one and merged into the river.The sword essences converged!Stars suddenly appeared in the sky, corresponding to the sword intents. These stars were also merging with each other. Gradually, with the time sword intent as the main force, countless small stars surrounded it!A long sword was wandering in this world as if it had found its home. It was shocking!30,50,70 ...After a long time, the 100th sword intent was formed.At this moment, a hundred DAOs converged, and a hundred stars converged!"Hundred swords complete!"A loud voice resounded through this part of the universe. With a loud boom, a long sword swallowed Time and Stars. With a slash, Hong long long, the sounds of explosions continued. Third saint's cries of pain rose again!"It's good that you're alive!"Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell,'I'm alive ... And I'm about to succeed! It's only a hundred swords. If this sword can't withstand it, how can it bear my ten thousand sword intents? Three seniors, today, we ... Will create a man-made world!"BOOM!The small world shook violently. A huge tree exuded sword intent, and the transparent Foundation beneath the ground shook violently. The surrounding barriers also shook continuously!Man-made world!The three Supreme Saints were excited. A man-made Sword World!An artificial spiritual world!This was unprecedented!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the outside world.Li Hao trembled and bled, as if he couldn't withstand the man-made small world. He kept suppressing his sword intent, strengthening his body, and absorbing all kinds of power to replenish himself!Suppression!As long as he could suppress it, he would definitely succeed.This time, the trip to the seal was the most crucial. Before this, he had never thought of doing this. However, with the three great saints present, if he did not do this, he would be letting them down."Just a hundred swords!"Li Hao smiled hideously. Do you think you can overturn the sky with a hundred swords? Besides ... You are all my own sword intent!"BOOM!The sword intent was so abundant that it tore the sky apart!At this moment, a sword appeared in Li Hao's hand. He chuckled."The heavenly Sword ... Today ... Will battle the starry sky!"He waved his sword!Slash!BOOM!In front of him, sword city was instantly slashed, and a powerful sword intent exploded out. This person was going to kill him?"Kill!"The firmament sword was infused with hundreds of sword intents, with time as the main force. With one strike, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. Sword city, which had been close to Li Hao, was instantly enraged. It burst out with powerful sword intents and began fighting with Li Hao in the depths of the universe.The sword intent pierced through heaven and earth!After a long time, the venerable sovereigns in the distance saw some figures and were surprised. What was Li Hao doing?  Fight against sword city?In that case, did this guy really want to swallow up those three small Saints?That's true ... It seems like the three little fellows are gone!This guy was really ruthless."His strength seems to have increased a lot!"He could vaguely see that Li Hao was holding another sword, and he was suppressing sword city with a monstrous sword intent.The two sides engaged in a fierce battle!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Battle!Endless battle.In the sky and on the ground, there was a crazy battle!The two sword intents shattered in the air. One was the bright moon sword intent, and the other was the longevity sword intent. The longevity sword intent was stronger, but unfortunately, there were only swords here.Although the bright moon sword essence was weak, with its master around, it could burst out limitlessly!For a time, they were actually evenly matched!In his brain, the sword essence kept surging out, which relieved the pressure on the three great saints and gave them enough time to adapt to the bright moon sword essence.At the same time.In his spiritual world, the 100 stars in the sky were constantly changing as if they were constantly reorganizing and adjusting themselves. Li Hao was also adjusting his sword technique.Each time, the sword move he used was different.Some were strong, some were weak. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  Sometimes, he would even explode with a self-mutilating power, causing his body to explode and his blood to dye the sky red.It was a failed adjustment and a mistake in the combination.It was only now that Li Hao had truly created his own style on the path of swordsmanship. Although he was still imitating the longevity sword, he had also created the bright moon sword with time as its main force!There were thousands of great DAOs, and it was easy to comprehend them but difficult to create them.On this day, Li Hao, who had been well-prepared, kept improving his swordsmanship in the vast universe and fought against the sword city left by the sword venerable.Gradually, the sword in his hand stabilized.In his spiritual sea, the hundred stars also gradually stabilized.At this moment, Li Hao shouted,""Haoyue!"BOOM!This strike was the fusion of a hundred swords. A bright moon rose into the sky, and a long river appeared. The sword slashed towards the sword city!Bang! Bang!With a loud noise, Jian Cheng was sent flying. For the first time, the sword of venerable the sword was destroyed by Li Hao, and the longevity sword intent was released!Li Hao stood in the air, panting heavily!At this moment, a sword mark appeared on the sword city. He laughed, a crazy laugh. I left a mark on the starry sky sword, on the real starry sky sword!It wasn't until today that I've finally reached this step.Li Hao looked up at the starry sky with a brilliant smile.A hundred swords were formed!Spirit sea formed!His gains from the day were all that he had gained enlightenment of, and all that he had gained. As of this moment, Dao meridians began to open up inside of him. 123,124 ....The sword attack that combined essence, energy, and spirit had also opened more Dao meridians. Li Hao was moving toward 144 Dao meridians.

Chapter 2353 The Firmament Sword, The Spirit Sea
After a long time, the opening of the Dao Meridian ended.He had opened 144 meridians!The third cycle had not been completed yet. He was only one step away from the peak of the third level of Dao integration and reaching the fourth level of Dao integration to officially become a neo martial Heavenly King!Li Hao stopped himself from breaking through again. He had yet to return, and if a Heavenly King were to appear, Silver Moon would be in trouble.Only by returning could he officially break through and let the Heavenly King walk out.At that time ... He would kill any Heavenly King that appeared!"Three seniors ... We've succeeded!"Li Hao grinned. This time, if it weren't for the three of them, he wouldn't have achieved his current success.However ... After a long time, a weak voice came from the sword seal,""We need to sleep and stabilize this small world ... So that it can withstand your future sword of a thousand DAOs, a sword of ten thousand DAOs! Li Hao ... You must kill li daoheng ..."Li Hao's heart moved, and he nodded.The three of them had consumed too much energy, and they needed to stabilize this spiritual ocean. They needed to rest for a while. It was good too, in case they couldn't bear the pressure of the thousand swords.At this moment, Li Hao looked at sword city in the distance. Sword city didn't seem willing to get close to Li Hao, as if it was angry that Li Hao attacked it.Li Hao laughed,"sword city ... Starry sky sword!" It was the sword of the sword Saint! I've been using the name starry sky sword for a long time. The firmament sword also originates from the starry sky sword and is originally one ... Why don't ... You merge with my firmament sword after I form a thousand swords?"At this moment, there was no need for that. It might not be a good thing for the sword to be too powerful.The current firmament sword could contain a hundred of Li Hao's swords, and it could even kill a Heavenly King without much pressure. However, it was still a little lacking to deal with half-step sovereigns and venerable sovereigns.At that time, if he could merge with this sword city, it would be enough.The sword city ignored him and floated in the air again.Li Hao had almost looted everything in sword city, except for a sword.Within the sword city, apart from the small courtyard, there was nothing else.There wasn't even any remains to be seen!Li Hao stepped into the courtyard with a bright smile and said,""I'll gather a little more longevity sword intent. Soon, I'll be out of here ... You should stay here. It's not a good thing to take you out. You're too big a target!"Sword city didn't do anything, either, and allowed Li Hao to continue condensing his longevity sword intent.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In Hurricane city. Zheng Yu suddenly looked up at the sky. After a moment, he said slowly,""Li Hao, there seems to be some improvement ... Soon, the Heavenly King will be out!"Beside him, the Heavenly Kings were a little surprised.That was fast!This was much faster than the natural recovery of the world.It had only been a short while, and it could already accommodate a Heavenly King?However, the Heavenly Kings weren't as happy as they had imagined ... They couldn't wait any longer. Now ... Even if they could accommodate the Heavenly Kings, could they ... Deal with Li Hao?He's not courting death, right?Zheng Yu did not say anything. Since they could accommodate a Heavenly King, Li Hao would most likely reach the fourth level of Dao integration. After reaching the fourth level of Dao integration, could these few people ... Deal with Li Hao?It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!Perhaps, he was just going out to die.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Dynasty.The temple.The God of beginner martial arts looked up at the starry sky, thinking about something.The sword city was still sealed.Li Hao had entered the seal. If he was here to seize the starry sky sword, it would not be a good thing. Once the eight cities 'structure was broken and the starry sky sword was taken away by him, perhaps ... The plan of raising cats in all directions would be interrupted.What a headache! Not far away, King Dali's aura became stronger and stronger. The God of beginner martial was a little helpless. He really ... Had no choice."The king of Dali!"In the distance, King Dali, who was cultivating, suddenly woke up and looked at the temple."You're too slow," a voice said indifferently from the temple."I'll help you. You'll be able to completely merge with the power of the skeleton in three days and advance to the Heavenly King level! You ... Need to help me with something. ""What's the matter?"The king of Dali felt that he had to ask clearly."To guard the ruins of Saturn city! Don't let anyone take a single step inside!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe king of Dali was a little speechless. After a while, he said,""That's Li Hao's territory!"You want me to guard that side and not allow anyone to enter ... I won't be beaten to death, right?He might have advanced to the Heavenly King stage ... But Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and Li Hao all seemed to be staring at him."Do you agree? If you don't agree, then forget it. If you don't agree ... You'll have to fuse them yourself. It'll take at least three years!"The king of Dali was somewhat helpless. Three years?No way?After thinking for a long time, he asked, what if ... What if Li Hao's team attacks?He might not be able to win! Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  "We'll defend to the death and not come out!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe king of Dali gritted his teeth."Alright, I agree. But ... If we really can't hold on, don't blame me!"The God of beginner martial was too lazy to say anything more. A big hand appeared and the skeleton fell into his hand. In the blink of an eye, the extremely solid skeleton was crushed by his opponent. In an instant, a force integrated into the body of King Dali.The Dali King screamed in pain. The God of beginner martial didn't even look at him. What was this pain?This was how body forging should be!If one wanted to become strong, how could one not suffer a little?It was as if he had forcefully integrated this power into the other party's body, and the Dali King's aura instantly became much stronger.The God of beginner martial thought for a while and suddenly looked at a golden figure in the distance.""You're Li Hao's subordinate, so I'll help you advance to the Dao integration stage. You can fight a Heavenly King now! A ninth-refined golden body! Tell Li Hao ... The eight cities can not be broken, at least not now. I have no conflict with him, but ... If he breaks the eight cities, I have no choice but to act. I don't want to do that, but in the past, I promised someone ...""Senior ..."Just as director Zhou was about to speak, a huge force pressed him down. The voice of beginner God rose again,""You can continue! Whether Li Hao will agree or not ... We'll talk about it after you're done. Before you say anything, it's hard to say!"As soon as he finished speaking, a powerful force gushed into Zhou Chuan's body.Director Zhou grunted and was extremely shocked!This person ... Was so powerful!A pseudo-Emperor?It might not be a good thing to offend a half-step sovereign at this moment. Could the eight cities not be broken?As he thought about it, he no longer thought about it. Being suppressed by others and being forced to advance ... Since he could not resist, he could only enjoy it.As for how Li Hao would deal with it, he had no idea.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On this day, there was some movement from all sides.Heaven and earth seemed to have recovered once again.The Heavenly King was about to enter and exit the world!Li Hao, who was in the seal, was also ready to leave. He had taken everything he could. There was little hope of killing a venerable sovereign now, and the harvest in the seal would meet his expectations. After he got out, he would think of a way to kill the Heavenly Kings under Zheng Yu.

2354 Chapter 394
Within the seal.The hundred swords and the spirit sea were both completed. Li Hao had gained a lot at this moment.He was ready to leave.Killing venerable sovereigns ... This was wishful thinking.Now that he had yet to reach the fourth level of Dao integration, it was impossible for him to kill a half-step sovereign, let alone a venerable sovereign, so he should not think too much.However ... This time, his harvest was still unimaginable. He had also fought with a venerable sovereign and a half-step sovereign, which was a great benefit. The so-called fight was when a venerable sovereign killed him with a palm and a half-step sovereign killed him with a sword. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Before he left, Li Hao wanted to do one thing.He controlled the sword city and headed straight for the seal.He had already come, but he didn't say hello to the venerable sovereign when he came. Now that he was leaving, he had to say hello. Otherwise, people would think that he was impolite.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the eight trigrams seal.Red Moon Emperor opened his eyes again.In the past 100000 years, it had been very lively recently. People were singing and taking the stage, and none of them were idle.In the distance, Li Hao once again rode sword city over.Red Moon Emperor just looked on silently.When Li Hao approached, Red Moon Emperor said slowly,""Li Hao, those three kids seem to have disappeared?"Li Hao chuckled and said,"really?" I'm not too sure about this. "After that, he took the initiative to say,'I'm here to say goodbye to the venerable sovereign! I'm going to leave this place ..."Red Moon sovereign laughed.Say goodbye?Interesting!Li Hao couldn't leave through the seal, so it seemed that he had to leave through the Dao universe.That was true ... He would have a chance to observe it."What a polite child!"Red Moon sovereign smiled as if he was talking to a child. He looked at Li Hao and chuckled."It looks like your strength has improved. Are you confident in dealing with Zheng Yu and that li daoheng?""Not yet,"Li Hao shook his head and sighed,""The difference is too great, but ... I'm confident that I can resist them! I don't need you to worry about these things. I'm here to say goodbye and ... Li Hao has a small request. I wonder if you can satisfy this junior?""Tell me.""It's the blood essence of a venerable sovereign," Li Hao said sincerely."I accidentally took a drop of it last time and helped me severely injure yueshen!" I've come today to ask for a drop of blood essence!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe red moon Emperor's smile gradually disappeared. He looked at Li Hao without saying anything.What did that mean?A drop of blood essence? How?Li Hao's face was serious."It's not a loss for you, venerable sovereign. I took your blood essence to deal with your enemies, such as li daoheng and Zheng Yu ... You don't lack a drop of blood essence, venerable sovereign!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"Do you want to come in and get it?" Red Moon sovereign asked in a normal tone.Do you dare to come in?This Li Hao was actually so calm and composed when he talked about this matter, as if he was just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. He was really an extremely arrogant little fellow.Besides, if I give you the blood essence, do you dare to use it?Li Hao said softly,"I won't go in. I'll stay here!" I've been gathering longevity sword intent for a while now. I want to see if I can take a drop of the venerable sovereign's blood essence. If you can, then we'll all be happy. If you can't ... Please forgive me, venerable sovereign!""You're quite arrogant. Try it. "Red Moon sovereign stood up with his hands behind his back and approached the edge of the eight trigrams Formation. The Stargate above his head moved as well, and boundless pressure spread to the whole world.A Saint had arrogantly said that he wanted to take a drop of blood from a venerable sovereign!If there was no seal, where did the confidence of a weakling who could be killed with a single punch come from?Li Hao didn't say anything. He reached out his hand, and sword city turned into a long sword. It was the starry sky sword.On the sword, streams of longevity sword will gathered.Li Hao wouldn't bring sword city with him on this trip. The eight major cities were somewhat special. It might be better for sword city to be here, as it could maintain the seal. If he brought it out, there might be changes.Since that was the case ... In order to prevent li daoheng from entering again and taking the starry sky sword away ... It was better to waste the sword intent within. The sword would still be the same sword, but li daoheng probably wouldn't be able to obtain any benefits.Even if he were to make another sword, there wouldn't be much of a chance.I can't waste it!Li Hao wanted to let the longevity Swordmaster receive the attack so that he could see how powerful the longevity Swordmaster was.At this moment, Li Hao's qi and blood were gathering.A wave of sword intent spread out. Dao meridians continuously appeared in his body and surrounded him. A total of 144 Dao meridians had appeared, forming three circulations.He was about to reach the fourth level of Dao integration!Not only that, his spirit sea shook and the bright moon sword will also merged into the starry sky sword. The power of time flowed and the longevity sword will appeared.Red Moon Emperor was still calm.In this era, he was an invincible existence.p Whether it was li daoheng, Zheng Yu, or Li Hao ... None of them had the confidence to deal with him at the current stage. If they did, he would have died long ago. Why would he wait until today?No matter how much Li Hao borrowed from external forces, used the sword of the venerable sword, and gathered the sword will of the venerable sword ... He was not the venerable sword himself. It was impossible for him to kill him.In fact, it was impossible to hurt him.Li daoheng's sword Dao clone, which had the power of a half-step sovereign, could only leave a small wound on his fist at most, let alone extract a drop of blood essence.Li Hao was too arrogant!At this moment, Li Hao kept unleashing his power. His qi and blood were getting stronger and stronger, and his spirit, Qi, and soul were united. Above his head, there were two big words, Zhan Tian.At this moment, these two words seemed to be overflowing with waves of energy fluctuations.

2355 Chapter 394
The entire eight-trigram array trembled slightly.Li Hao closed his eyes. He was not thinking about venerable the sword's sword mind, but the day when the blood Emperor split the sky and earth with one strike.That was the first time he had seen a peerless existence fight in an illusion.This was also the strongest move he had seen so far.The illusory figure of the sword venerable had also displayed a sword intent that could break through the firmament, but it was not as shocking as this blade.At this moment, Li Hao had the support of the word "heaven battling". In front of him was the formation left by the blood Emperor. The key was that the formation was closely related to the eight godly weapons. In fact, the eight godly weapons were related to the formation.This formation had absorbed a great deal of energy. Where did the energy go?In fact, Li Hao had a vague idea.It went into the saber!He went to resurrect the cat!So, the end of this formation ... Was actually connected to the blood saber.Asking for venerable sovereigns 'blood essence was just an excuse. Even if he really hurt her, he might not be able to take her blood essence. Li Hao just wanted to try and see if he could mobilize some of the power of the eight main cities and draw out the blood saber.At this moment, the starry sky sword in his hand trembled.The formation trembled!Not only that, but at this moment, the five major cities under Li Hao's control in the Dao universe seemed to be trembling slightly.At this moment, the sky above Li Hao's head split open, and the universe of the great Dao even appeared.Just like li daoheng, he was also afraid of being locked on by venerable sovereigns. However, it was not a big problem for him to appear for a while.The five big cities suddenly burst out with a faint light. Rays of light shot out and went straight to the eight trigrams Formation. Inside the seal, the red moon sovereign frowned slightly.Eight Trigrams universe formation!He had been entangled with this formation for a hundred thousand years.At the same time, Li Hao's power had already reached its peak. The next moment, his body suddenly became blurry, as if The Phantom of the venerable sword had possessed him. In fact, The Phantom of the venerable sword had indeed disappeared instantly.It was as if it had merged into Li Hao's body.Six rays of light flickered on the eight trigrams Formation.Only Hurricane city and Galaxy city were not affected. Li Hao shouted, and a bloody saber seemed to have appeared between the sky and the earth.At this moment, Li Hao's roar resounded through the world!"Kill!"The sword ray merged with the blood saber's illusionary shadow, and in almost an instant, the sword ray broke through the air!Red Moon sovereign frowned slightly. Without saying anything, he raised his hand and punched!This punch was also boundlessly powerful!  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Just the pressure alone was enough to terrorize the entire universe!The Stargate above his head glowed with light once again, suppressing the heavens and earth.The venerable sovereign resisted the Stargate's suppression with one strike and punched out at the same time!It was silent!When the fist shadow and the sword radiance collided, a powerful force instantly swept out in all directions. A powerful and boundless counterforce instantly shattered Li Hao's body. No matter how powerful Li Hao was, he couldn't withstand this counterforce!But at this moment ... The venerable sovereign's fist shadow also shattered at the same time. A sword light, not the longevity sword intent, but the bright moon sword intent, emerged from the shattering sword intent and stabbed into the opponent's fist in an instant.Creak!The venerable sovereign withdrew his fist. At this moment, a faint trace of blood appeared on his fist. He raised his head and looked in Li Hao's direction. A long river, like a giant dragon, extended into the universe of the great path.Li Hao reappeared and walked in the air. A sword appeared in his hand, but it was not the starry sky sword, but the firmament sword!There were some golden blood stains on the sword.It was the blood left behind by the sword that had pierced into his fist.Red Moon sovereign frowned slightly and watched silently. Li Hao sighed without turning his head."I didn't expect venerable sovereigns to be so powerful. Even after merging the will of venerable sword and the will of venerable blood Emperor, they only managed to leave a barely visible wound on venerable sovereigns ... The power of venerable sovereigns is really despairing!"Red Moon Emperor looked at him silently and stepped into the great path universe. Suddenly, he said softly,""You know that I want to explore the great Dao universe and take away a trace of my blood. Li Hao, are you bold and ignorant, or ... Do you have other motives?"Li Hao's sword had taken away a little bit of his blood, not his essence.That little bit of blood actually doesn't have much use, but ... Li Hao clearly knows that I want to invade the Dao universe, so why did he still take it away?This time, he had specially come over for this bit of blood.What was he after?This person wasn't an idiot. It was obvious that this was his goal.If there was any difference between this blood and the blood essence from before ... The biggest difference was that this blood was fresh. There was a trace of his fist intent left in it, but it didn't have much effect.Could it be that Li Hao wanted to comprehend his own Dao?That would really be a joke!The universe of the great path was about to be completely sealed. Li Hao turned around, looked at Red Moon sovereign, and then at the starry sky sword that he had left behind. He smiled and said,"Venerable sovereign, Li Hao has no ill intentions. He's just trying to see if this drop of blood can leave an heir for the venerable sovereign, in case the venerable sovereign stays in this world for 100000 years after his death without leaving any bloodline behind!"Red Moon sovereign chuckled.The great Dao universe was completely sealed!Leave behind?What an interesting little fellow. He didn't know what Li Hao was going to do, but ... That guy dared to take away a wisp of his new blood. The Dao universe was opening right under his nose ... Do you know that it's very likely that I'll completely lock the entrance to the Dao universe?If he really did, you ... Will be in trouble!

2356 Chapter 394
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the universe of the great path.The lightning started to gather.The firmament sword trembled slightly as if it was about to be baptized by lightning. The blood might also contain the power of the Crimson Moon!Moreover, after entering the Dao universe, this blood seemed to be coming to life.At this moment, Li Hao laughed. Suddenly, his spiritual sea shook, and hundreds of sword intents burst out. A small world seemed to appear in the universe.Would the star ... Come?This was a novel thing!His spirit sea emerged!At this moment, as expected, it was as if such a novel thing had appeared for the first time in the universe of the great path. At the end of the universe, there seemed to be a star leaping through the sky.This was the heart of the universe, the heart of the great Dao.With the appearance of this star, the entire universe seemed to have quieted down in an instant. Even the man-made world, the spirit sea, and the foreign objects stopped all movement at this moment!Not only that ... The firmament sword in his hand, which had been trembling, also stopped in an instant.The blood on the sword felt like it was about to turn into a living person, and it stopped at this moment. The few big cities in the distance also quieted down at this moment, and there was no movement at all.The world was quiet!The star appeared. Like a curious child, it circled the world in Li Hao's spirit sea and then suddenly entered it. Li Hao's face lit up!This was what he wanted!Last time, this star had rolled around in his River and he had gained some insight into the power of time. This time, the star had indeed become interested and entered the world of his spirit sea. In the future, the star of time in his spirit sea might be even more powerful!At this moment, Li Hao moved his body, and the word "Dao" appeared.He struggled and walked forward.He had to get close to that star!This star was half illusory and half illusory.At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be interested in his spirit sea. He moved forward with great difficulty. The firmament sword in his hand glowed with a faint light, and a weak Time Force flowed slowly.Li Hao carefully and gently threw the firmament sword toward the stars. The firmament sword was mixed with a trace of blood.Li Hao held his breath as the firmament sword slowly approached. Perhaps because the firmament sword also carried some power of time, the stars playing in the distance did not move or repel it.It allowed the firmament sword to approach it bit by bit, and even ... Began to touch it.On the other side of the illusionary star, the firmament sword suddenly exerted a little force, as if it had stabbed into the Star. A drop of blood instantly disappeared and burrowed into the illusionary star.As for the star, it seemed to be frightened and disappeared from its spot.At this moment, the world was still silent.Li Hao, on the other hand, held his breath and watched silently. After a long time, he let out a long breath, grabbed the firmament sword, and examined it. Then, he suddenly smiled. This star definitely did not only appear on his side.And ... Li daoheng!The other half of the body was connected to this side.And the illusory half was connected to that side."I just don't know if this wisp of venerable sovereign's blood can enter the other side. If it can ... I think li daoheng will be very happy. That venerable sovereign might be very happy too!Perhaps, he could lock onto the position of the void Dao universe.Li Hao smiled.He exhaled gently. This was very risky. If he couldn't connect to the other side and it was only on his side, now that Xingchen had taken away that drop of blood, perhaps someone would be able to lock onto his side.But if ... He took it away and really entered the other side, li daoheng would have a good show to watch!Looking at his spirit sea, Li Hao saw that the transparent star in the sky seemed to have grown much larger. He smiled again. Sure enough, he had absorbed some time power.However, this time, he had used the firmament sword to stab the star, which had frightened it. Would it dare to appear again next time?The key was that he had already conjured his spirit sea. Next time ... What kind of novel thing could lure the other party out?At this moment, Li Hao looked around. The whole world seemed to have been sealed.He floated around without making any sound.He instantly landed on top of a large city.In the city, some soldiers and cultivators fell into a strange silence, as if time had frozen.There was a Saint here, but ... Even a Saint was frozen in place.Perhaps only a Heavenly King could barely resist the power of that star. Moreover, it would be sealed for a long time before it could escape. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Without any disturbance, Li Hao entered the star sea in the universe of the great path.At this moment, billions of stars were floating.Some of the stars were particularly powerful, but Li Hao didn't care about them. Instead, he chose some familiar stars and began to move them.The spirit Sea World was opened!He moved the stars one by one into his spirit sea.It was not the planet of the earth-covered sword or Lin Hongyu. Instead, it was those whom he was not sure of their safety.For example, Dao Jian's stars, the Queen's stars, and some unfamiliar but rather powerful stars ...Li Hao didn't even know who these Natal stars belonged to.He didn't care!He moved the stars one by one into his spiritual ocean, and in the sky above his spiritual ocean, more stars appeared. After a brief silence, Li Hao began to perform his magic again.

2357 Chapter 394
The divine text of the word "Dao" also entered it. In an instant, changes appeared in his spiritual sea. Stars appeared one after another, illusory yet real!In the great path universe, some stars had disappeared, leaving some gaps.Li Hao pondered for a while. Suddenly, Dao meridians emerged in his body and turned into stars. They returned to their original appearance and stayed in place.At this point, Li Hao had finally completed everything.He instantly disappeared from his original spot.When he was far away, Li Hao's body exploded with a dazzling sword intent that shook the world. He laughed loudly and resounded between the sky and the earth. "I'm back!""Hahaha!"Li Hao's laughter reverberated through the air!The frozen time began to flow again. No one noticed anything unusual, even the Saints. They only felt a little dazed before they heard Li Hao's voice.A Black Dog rushed out of the city in excitement!Li Hao had returned!There were quite a few people in the five great cities. Some of them had entered through the opened passageways. At this moment, they were all rather excited. The Marquis had returned.However, there were also a few people who glanced at the Galaxy in the sky. He was a little puzzled.Everyone was used to the billions of stars. There was nothing special about it, except ... A few people felt a little uncomfortable. Originally, they still had some connection with one of the billions of stars.At this moment ... It also seemed to be a little intermittent.Of course, as Li Hao approached, the feeling quickly disappeared. The feeling only appeared for a moment and then disappeared. He looked at the void again and saw that nothing had changed, so there was nothing unusual.At this moment, Saints flew out of the city.The Redwood quickly transformed into a human form, its face filled with joy,""Lord Marquis has returned ... Congratulations to Lord Marquis for advancing one step further and achieving great success in your divine arts!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao even suspected that it knew that he had really improved, but from the looks of it, it was probably just trying to flatter him!Li Hao laughed."Thank you for your kind words, senior Suki. I've indeed gained a lot this time!" "Pass down the message that I'm going to advance to the fourth level of Dao integration today and step into a realm comparable to the neo martial Heavenly King ... Heaven and earth might stabilize again and officially accommodate Heavenly Kings! Tell everyone to be careful and keep a close eye on Hurricane city ...""Congratulations, Lord Marquis!"At this moment, it wasn't just Suki. Everyone in the city was congratulating him.Fourth level of Dao integration!How long has it been?Although Li Hao had been gone for a long time, which was the longest he had ever been gone for-almost four months-Li Hao had only been at the second or third level of Dao integration before, but he was about to reach the fourth level today.At this stage, it was extremely difficult to improve!Li Hao was actually going to improve again!Everyone was overjoyed. Li Hao laughed."Thank you, everyone. It's all thanks to your help. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to leave so quickly. I won't say much. Then, I ... Will be advancing soon!"As soon as he finished speaking, 144 giant Dragons flew out!The sky was full of stars!The 144 giant Dragons instantly swam into 144 of the 360 regions. Among them, 144 huge stars suddenly flickered!Everyone looked up and felt extremely shocked! The 144 regions were all flashing with light!Li Hao's voice shook the world."Four levels of Dao integration. Four major cycles have been completely formed with 36 Dao meridians as one major cycle. Today ... I've entered the mid-stage Dao integration realm!"BOOM!The 144 planets trembled instantly, and huge pillars of light shone out. Among these pillars of light, 36 of them were connected to each other, gradually forming four complete cycles.The aura on Li Hao's body trembled, and the power of a great Dao swept over!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, whether it was the people inside the Dao universe or outside the Dao universe, all the cultivators of the new Dao felt something different.The entire world seemed to have started to jump for joy.The world seemed to have recovered a little.Countless energy seeped out from nowhere. At this moment, there was even the power of great DAOs overflowing. The new Dao cultivators seemed to have sensed the opportunity and began to cultivate.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In Hurricane city.Zheng Yu looked at cangqiong and said softly,""He has indeed advanced!"Fourth level of Dao integration!Behind him, the Heavenly Kings were silent.Don't let us out!He was really ... A little helpless.Even though there was more than one Heavenly King, but ... If they really went out, would they really be able to win with just six or seven Heavenly Kings?Zheng Yu didn't seem to mention this and just watched silently.The world was recovering really quickly.It could already accommodate a Heavenly King so quickly.As for Li Hao, he no longer suppressed his realm. Or rather, he felt that he was no longer afraid of the Heavenly King and took the initiative to advance."Fourth level Dao integration ..."Zheng Yu mumbled and waved his hand. The people around him left one after another.Soon, another Zheng Yu appeared, and his aura was also growing, and it was growing very quickly. The new Dao Zheng Yu said softly,""There are many people who have advanced now. There are billions of stars of the great path. As long as it's not too obvious, they can't distinguish them one by one!"Zheng Yu nodded slightly. His voice was gentle and not too restless."Follow closely behind, but don't be too eye-catching. If nothing goes wrong, I'm not the only one doing it."Zheng Yu nodded slightly.The two of them didn't say anything more.Li Hao, the first to win might not necessarily win. We still have to look at the results.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about anyone else.The Dao Meridian ran through the Galaxy, and its aura kept growing.

Since they felt the great path's vibration, how could this place not shake?

2358 Chapter 394
Not only that, there were also many stars here that were flickering, as if Li Hao was advancing."In this world, how many people are actually other people's clones or spies ... I don't know."However, as long as I don't understand you too well, I will move your planet ... Into this place, and that will be enough.You want to give me a hard blow ... If you move, I'll give you an even harder blow!Li Hao thought to himself and smiled.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At another location.Within the seal.Red Moon sovereign sat cross-legged and sensed something silently. After a long time, he frowned slightly and looked up at the sky with some doubts. Just now, it seemed that his blood had lost all connection, but it quickly recovered a little bit of a weak connection.It was extremely weak!What was Li Hao doing?He didn't destroy my blood?He frowned.He was sure that his blood should still be in the great path universe. However, it was not easy to determine its exact location. It was a little too dim, and the connection was very weak.However, if he was given some time, he might be able to lock onto the position completely!"Intermittent ... It seems to be blocked by something, not just the barrier of the Dao universe ..."He mumbled with some doubt.Of course, he didn't know much about the great path universe, and he couldn't be sure why.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the void Dao universe.The sword-carrying man frowned slightly. He looked at the moon goddess, who was gradually recovering, and then at the endless void. He felt that ... He had been led by someone recently, such as Li Hao.Previously, the universe had trembled.Today, it seemed a little different.Of course, he knew that Li Hao was advancing to the fourth level of Dao integration, but ... Would his advancement be able to affect this place?Or was it that after he advanced, he would open up a dual-Dao universe sooner or later?"I can't see through that guy anymore!"The man with the sword said softly, but he quickly smiled again. After planning for so many years, was he still inferior to a child?If that was the case ... It would be laughable.He looked at yueshen, who had recovered a lot, and said,""After staying here for so long, I've indeed lost some of my control. Since you've recovered, then you should leave earlier. The second-generation successor's strength isn't weak at all. He's quite carefree."The huge star turned into a human figure. Soon, a bright moon appeared and the moon goddess slowly walked out. She was as cold as ever, but there was a hint of killing intent in her eyes.The last time she had just walked out, she had been tricked by Li Hao and had almost been killed by an explosion.Now, he had spent a lot of time and paid a great price to barely recover.She could merge with heaven and earth, and there was a half-step Emperor swordsman in her team ... But in the end, she had been tricked by Li Hao."He advanced in rank?""Yes,""The faster he advances in rank, the faster he will die!"Yueshen was filled with killing intent. She was really angry at this moment."That idiot second-generation, does he really think he can replace me just because he absorbed some of the Silver Moon's power?"He didn't say anything else. In an instant, a bright moon tore through the great path universe again. Soon, a bright moon appeared in the sky, and the shrine appeared in the moon again. The moon god turned into a statue, and the sword-carrying man followed.They had come out again.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.In the North.The Queen looked up at the sky and snorted. How dare you come out!It seemed that he had not suffered enough losses the last time. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  However, now that Li Hao had advanced, she did not dare to rashly go to the central continent again, in case Li Hao came out and dealt with her.Looking at the moon in the distance, she also transformed into a bright moon, floating in the sky and shining on the earth. At this moment, two bright moons appeared in the entire land of Silver Moon, one South and One North, shining on each other as if they were provoking each other.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao didn't care about anyone. Very quickly, he completed four cycles of his 144 meridians. The aura he exuded underwent a huge change. At this moment, the aura he exuded was suffocating.He activated the great Dao universe and walked out.A figure appeared between heaven and earth. Soon, more figures flew in from all directions. Everyone was a little uneasy, but they only heaved a sigh of relief when Li Hao appeared.Heaven and earth seemed to be able to accommodate a Heavenly King.But now, Li Hao was the only one on Silvermoon's side who truly had the battle strength of a Heavenly King.There were quite a few Heavenly Kings in Hurricane city.The Queen could fight against a Heavenly King. With the appearance of the second moon, everyone knew that li daoheng and the real moon god had appeared. These people could also use the battle power of a Heavenly King.If Li Hao didn't show up, everyone would still feel uneasy."Lord Marquis!""Congratulations!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEveryone chimed in. Li Hao nodded slightly and looked around. Many people had disappeared. He didn't know where they had gone."It's still alright!"Li Hao glanced at the crowd and smiled.""Everyone has more or less made some progress. It's been a few months since I last saw you, and I'm glad to see you! There are more Dao integration cultivators than before, and so are the sun and moon ... It seems that everyone has not wasted their time!""Gather all the Dao integration and sages. I've reached the fourth level of the Dao integration realm this time. Let's see if I can kill a few Hurricane Heavenly Kings to liven up the mood!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEveryone was speechless.You ... You're really brave!As for Li Hao, he raised his head and looked at the northern region. Currently, many experts had gathered in the North.Killing the Heavenly King was secondary.This time, he was going to stir up some waves again. He was going to force everyone's clones, chess pieces, puppets ... To come out!Not only that, but this time, he wanted to take down the remaining two big cities.Hurricane city was very troublesome!A half-step sovereign living in it, perhaps ...He looked up at the sky and chuckled. There were two bright moons, and Li daoheng lived on one of them. Why not ... Zheng Yu move to the Queen's place?Of course, this was very difficult!However, it wasn't like there was no hope.‚Äã If Zheng Yu moved away, he could take back Hurricane city.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the Queen, who was hanging in the sky, suddenly felt a little uncomfortable.She knew that Li Hao had appeared.After that guy appeared, he didn't hide anything. His aura was extremely strong, and even his sword intent was soaring.He was very arrogant!However, I shouldn't be his biggest enemy at the moment, so why do I feel so uneasy?He was a little confused. He suddenly felt that the North was not safe ... Or rather, it was not safe even within the Silver Moon territory.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the distance, which was almost the end of the world, Ying Hongyue gritted her teeth and looked toward the central region.Li Hao, you're improving really fast!But ... I'm not slow either.The flying sword immortal beside her had a silent expression at this moment, as if he was thinking about something. Ying Hongyue saw this and said in a deep voice, "Don't think too much. You and I, father and daughter, are working together. Li Hao might have the upper hand now, but he will die before you and I!"The flying sword immortal was silent.Ying Hongyue frowned slightly and didn't say anything else. At this moment, he still needed to expel the power of the red moon and didn't have the mood to talk about this.That venerable sovereign ... Ever since Li Hao destroyed some of the seals, his infiltration was getting stronger and stronger.In the past, he could still defend against it, but now, it was extremely difficult.The bloodline power of the eight great families was also far from as strong as before.Ying Hongyue gently exhaled. She was also a little helpless. "Li daoheng, Zheng Yu, are you guys not going to care about this at all? aren't you guys going to restrict that guy at all?"Be careful not to fall in the end!

Chapter 2359 The Bright Li Hao (3 In 1)
Two bright moons hung in the sky.They were all enemies.Li Hao looked up at the sky and smiled. Heaven and earth ... Since I can't take down heaven now, I'll take down Earth First. I'll definitely take down the eight main cities!He couldn't win by stalling for time.He could only take the initiative to attack!"You guys get ready to besiege Hurricane city ... I'll go to Galaxy city. The few new martial Saints, come with me. It's time to talk to director Zhang!"Li Hao looked around, his tone calm.At this moment, he felt like he was looking down on everything.The hearts of the few new martial Saints moved. They didn't say anything and quickly walked out.It seemed that Li Hao was determined to take down the eight main cities.However ... Even if Zhang an gave up Star River City, what about Hurricane city?Of course, this wasn't a problem that they could solve. An ancient city guarded by a half-step sovereign was something that no one could take down.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Star River City.Galaxy city did not remain in one place, but it was always under Silver moon's watch. Zhang an did not hide his whereabouts to avoid a major dispute between the two sides.Recently, Qian Wuliang had been going to star-river City frequently. The few Saints here were rather polite. Zhang an just didn't pay much attention to them, but he didn't care much about these things either.While some people in the city were still discussing the recovery of the world and Li Hao's advancement to the fourth level of Dao integration, Zhang an, who had been cultivating in the city Lord's mansion, suddenly opened his eyes and looked into the distance.The other Saints who were talking with Qian Wuliang also looked into the distance after a while.The void broke open.A River seemed to come from the sky. Someone stepped on the chaotic River and floated down. His voice was clear and gentle."Director Zhang, I've come out of my closed-door cultivation and have come to visit the Galaxy. Do you welcome me?"Zhang an's figure appeared. He looked at Li Hao with doubt in his eyes.Today's Li Hao ... Didn't seem to have just improved in terms of his level. There were also some other changes that he couldn't put his finger on. He just felt that this person was a little strange. For a moment, he felt that his sword intent was monstrous.There was also a moment when he felt that this person didn't have any sword intent at all.It was barely visible and was difficult to detect."Just come!"Zhang an was as calm as ever.Li Hao stepped through the air with several new martial Saints behind him. A few Saints also appeared beside Zhang an.They were all old acquaintances!Qian Wuliang also hurried forward and bowed."Lord Marquis! This subordinate was busy with official business and didn't have the time to welcome Lord Marquis!" "It's just a small matter, there's no need to do this!"  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  Li Hao smiled."Wuliang, you don't have to be so formal. Hongyu has already told me some things. As the saying goes, make the best use of everyone and everything. You also need to be capable to overcome difficulties! The greater the ability, the heavier the responsibility. There's no need to feel pressured. If you do well, you'll get more returns than others!"Qian Wuliang nodded hurriedly and didn't say anything.He was as humble and humble as ever. Even though he was at the Dao integration stage and ranked in the top ten or even top five of the human race of the new era, he was still humble when he met Li Hao. He was not only humble toward Li Hao, but also toward the veteran Silver Moon martial masters, even if they were weaker than him.Although everyone was a little afraid of his ability, very few people would say anything else."Guardian turtle, have a chat with the seniors. We're all old friends. We haven't seen each other for many years, and we're still friends. There's no need to avoid suspicion. I don't mind, and director Zhang doesn't mind either."Zhang an nodded slightly and said calmly,"let's talk and reminisce about the past. It's fine. If you don't have any objections, I won't interfere.""The chief is still the most open-minded!"Zhang an smiled and didn't say much."Let's talk inside,"he waved his hand."Alright!"Li Hao strode toward the city Lord's mansion. Behind him, a group of people looked at each other worriedly. They were not going to fight, were they?The old turtle and the others knew that Li Hao had come here to take away the star River City.However, out of the eight main cities, the Zhang family, the Zhao family, and the Saints were still alive. They had already given their main cities to Li Hao. With great difficulty, they had killed the Zhou family and seized the star River City.They had done their best, but Li Hao had even tried to take Star River City away.The ancient city was quite useful at times.For example, when Li Hao self-detonated his great Dao, if not for the main city, wouldn't all the Saints have died?Moreover, the main city itself was a Holy Land for absorbing energy for cultivation. It was also a defensive divine weapon. It was difficult for outsiders to sneak into the main city, and it had both offensive and defensive capabilities.At this moment, giving up the main city was a very dangerous thing for Zhang an and the others.The few of them were a little apprehensive, but they didn't mention this. The Saint of the Zhang family and the two elders of the Zhao family were all acquaintances. The diamond Wood had lived with them for more than 100000 years. Now that they were meeting again, they were all very complicated.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the city Lord's Hall.Zhang an raised his chin slightly."Have a seat.""Many thanks."Li Hao sat down below, and Zhang an did not sit on the seat of the castellan. Instead, he sat opposite Li Hao, and a Jade pot appeared in his hand."Do you want tea or wine?""Let's drink,"Zhang an was stunned for a moment before he smiled."I thought you would drink tea.
