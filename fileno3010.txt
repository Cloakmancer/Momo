"Is lightning powerful?""Very strong!"Li Hao said in a deep voice, I borrowed the power of a seventh-rank magical beast, so there must be a seventh-rank Thunderbolt! Now, if I help senior Wushan recover, there will definitely be lightning at the peak of the seventh tier ... In addition to the time I've used several times before, even if it can't be stacked to the eighth tier, it will at least be at the peak of the seventh tier, and at least nine bolts of seventh tier lightning will strike down ..."Li Zhu was silent for a moment before he nodded. However, I'm afraid that you and I will both have to bear at least nine Thunderbolts, each of which is equivalent to a full-power attack of the seventh step. Of course, if it's shared with Red Moon, it might not be so strong, from the peak of the seventh step to the beginning of the seventh step ... It's not a big problem for me to withstand it, but what about you?"He felt that he would not have a problem.But Li Hao?Li Hao smiled and looked at Kong Ji.  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  Kong Ji was stunned. After a moment, he understood. He was speechless. He quickly said, "I'll keep resurrecting you, but ... I don't have the ability to resurrect you if I kill you in one go!"If he couldn't kill Li Hao in one strike, he could continue to resuscitate Li Hao, but if he were to be killed in one strike ... His Dao of life and death hadn't reached that level yet."That's enough. In addition, pay attention to the safety of King Huai and the other two!"At this point, the world of Nirvana and the sky-stealing sun-shifting technique appeared in an instant. Without saying a word, Lizhu instantly presented a region and shrouded everyone.Everyone quickly concealed their auras.In front of him, a Red Moon was already in sight.Ever since he left Tian Fang last time, Li Hao had been setting up and planning. Although there were some problems along the way ... Today, it was time for him to reap the rewards. There were many venerable sovereigns, but as long as the lightning was strong enough, everyone could bear it together. Whoever was struck to death first would be unlucky!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Crimson Moon.The other venerable sovereigns did not feel too uneasy after Red Moon master and the others left.‚Äã After all, Hong Yue had sent five top venerable sovereigns this time, which was comparable to all the top combat forces of an eighth-rank world. The worlds such as Yunxiao would not send all their troops, so they were not so worried.At this moment, he was more worried about whether the neo martial arts would attack.However, last time, neo martial didn't make a move, which meant that neo martial might not be nearby, which made people feel more at ease.Grade 7 AI Hong was guarding the red moon alone.The rank seven Supreme Emperor LAN Yue was in the endless sky World next door. It was not too far away, so AI Hong was not too worried.Great worlds all had world barriers.As long as the realm gate was not broken, it was difficult for ordinary people to enter through the realm wall. Moreover, this was a world with an owner, not a world without an owner. For a ninth-rank world like tianfang, if the realm gate was closed, even an eighth-rank venerable sovereign would find it difficult to enter.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.King Huai suddenly raised his head. As a newly-appointed venerable sovereign, he was different from the venerable sovereigns of Senlan. Although there were still some restrictions, the venerable sovereigns of Senlan were relatively free, while he ... Was surrounded by venerable sovereigns of Red Moon.In fact, it was also a kind of imprisonment, which meant that the Crimson Moon did not fully trust them yet.It was very normal!At this moment, King Huai seemed to have sensed something, or simply received a message. It was not very clear, but he had a general idea of the situation. He looked at the two venerable sovereigns who had also surrendered not far away-Phoenix and Chan Xiu.The fact that the two of them had not betrayed Li Hao after joining Red Moon was already the greatest loyalty they could show.After all, one was a rank eight world, while the other was a rank three world.King Huai felt that it was normal for them to betray Li Hao. Since they didn 't, it meant that they were still loyal ... Even though these two had only joined not long ago, King Huai felt that they were still alright.At this moment, he sent a voice transmission, there will be some changes later! We have two choices ... The moment the situation changes, we will leave the Crimson Moon, give up our energy, and wait for help!""The second ..."King Huai hesitated for a moment, but he still transmitted his voice,"Continue to stay and resist with the venerable sovereigns of the red moon! If we can share more of the Crimson Moon's power, the three of us will quickly reach the peak of rank three ... If the opportunity is right, those two will reach rank four, and we might be able to reach rank four as well. We'll need to take some risks. What do you two think?"The two of them were startled and their hearts moved.Li Hao, is he coming?However, there was a tier 7 here!Sector Lord Sen LAN had left too. This ... Was he still going to attack?"Fellow Daoist Huai, what ... What do you think?"The two of them still asked tentatively. This young man from neo martial arts ... To them, King Huai was actually still considered young.However, they didn't dare to underestimate this person.King Huai sent a voice transmission,"I bet on the second one. This is an opportunity!" The red moon was severely injured, which may be a great opportunity. Now that we are separated, it will be difficult to integrate again. After all, the master of the red moon is still alive, and the great path universe will not be destroyed. At most, he will be seriously injured, and we ... May take this opportunity to obtain greater benefits, provided that we are still alive. "The two of them were a little hesitant. This was too dangerous.The next moment, he glanced at Huai King and gritted his teeth. Huai King was such a smart person, such a cheap person ... Alright, they thought so, but he was not afraid and dared to gamble. This guy who was known as the shame of neo martial arts, if he was not afraid of death, why should we be afraid?It was indeed an opportunity!"Huai King, Silver Moon King ... Can ... Can you succeed?"At this moment, the two of them were more worried about this.There were two rank seven venerable sovereigns here, and the other one could arrive at any time. Moreover, there were many venerable sovereigns in the realm. To them, hundreds of venerable sovereigns were enough to make their scalps numb.After joining the red moon, he could understand why the great world was so powerful. It was terrifying to have so many venerable sovereigns.

"Get rid of that! If they didn't succeed, they would all die! If we succeed, we can win!"King Huai did not consider failure at all.If they failed, they would all be finished.It was time to share his success. Therefore, he only considered the outcome of the victory. He did not care what Li Hao would do. He had only known the new king of the Silver Moon for a short time and seemed easy to talk to, but he was in fact a ruthless person. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Furthermore, he was a more patient fellow.In order to plot against the Crimson Moon world, the other party had planned for a long time and had given up on the level-7 forest world. To be honest, if it had been a human King, he would have killed them one by one. He would not have waited.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the void, dark clouds vaguely appeared.A star appeared in front of Li Hao. Dao domains spread all around him. The Nirvana Dao domain, the sky pilfered Dao domain ... Solitary void and Li Zhu were all using them. Li Hao also created Dao domains to conceal his surroundings.In front of him was monarch Wushan.At this moment, Wu Shan's expression changed.What was this?He wasn't sure, but he had a vague guess. He just felt that it was unbelievable.Was this ... Shi Guang?Turning back time?Yes, what Li Hao wanted to do was to reverse time and restore him to his previous peak. At this moment, Li Hao said,""Senior, energy can't come out of thin air. Now that you've recovered to your peak state, it doesn't mean that you can maintain it forever. It's just that my energy, the empty energy, has temporarily accumulated you to your previous peak state and maintained it for a period of time!""I don't know the exact time ... But it won't be too long!""After that, you'll still dissipate all your energy, and you can only rely on devouring the great Dao universe to recover ... This time, if you succeed, you'll naturally have enough opportunities to recover. If you fail ... Then there's nothing left."Wu Shan's expression was incomparably heavy. He looked at Li Hao."Very heaven-defying! Is there any other price other than the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?""I've used up some of my lifespan,"Li Hao made a judgment and slowly said,""I've been using the power of time all this time. My lifespan is almost up!""What?"Wushan was startled. You, are you going to die?It's almost time!Li Hao didn't say anything. He used the power of time many times. Each time he used the power of time, he consumed a lot of his lifespan, but ... It didn't matter. It didn't matter.He had three lives and three deaths!The fourth time ... He should have experienced it the last time, but with Kong Ji's help, he managed to avoid it the fourth time. This time, it would be difficult to avoid it again. Using time continuously was actually very draining.This time, if he succeeded, he didn't mind dying again.If I fail, I don't care even more. If I fail, I might die completely.Time began to rewind!A large amount of time power gathered on Wu Shan. He only went back for a while. At the moment, Wu Shan was just an ordinary cultivator, so it wasn't too difficult to go back. However, as Wu Shan's aura grew stronger, large drops of sweat appeared on Li Hao's forehead.His face seemed to have aged. It wasn't that easy to recover a peak rank seven.Even if it was only a temporary recovery, it was still a huge drain on Li Hao. On the side, Kong Ji kept using recovery techniques to condense the Flower of Life to help Li Hao recover.The two of them continued to exchange blows, which was only enough for a peak rank seven to recover for a period of time.Energy didn't appear out of thin air. It was at the cost of Kong Ji's and Li Hao's energy, as well as Li Hao's lifespan, that this peak rank seven venerable sovereign could only recover for a short while.This wasn't borrowing power, but was a little better than borrowing power. This was because Wu Shan was at the peak of the seventh step, so he could control his power and instantly familiarize himself with it. He didn't need to go through the familiarizing process or the consumption process.On the side, Li Zhu's face turned paler and paler.His sky pilfering realm was finding it a little difficult to bear. He could already feel the boundless pressure. It was the lock of the chaos lightning tribulation, the lock of anger. The sky pilfering technique was good, but ... Avoiding the lightning tribulation time and time again also increased the strength and anger of the lightning tribulation."How long more?" Li Zhu asked in a low voice. Perhaps very soon ... My Dao domain will be shattered!"The moment his Dao domain shattered, his aura was exposed.The lightning tribulation appeared instantly!This time, even if it was not a level eight lightning tribulation, it was at least a peak level Seven lightning tribulation. Even if it was drawn to the world of the Crimson Moon, it would still be a big problem if everyone had to share the Tribulation.The lightning tribulation wasn't completely weakened, only a portion of it."Senior, hold on a little longer! Senior, think about it ... It's a rank seven world!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Zhu was helpless. Nonsense, I know.Otherwise, would I have come?"Two seventh-rank venerable sovereigns, hundreds of venerable sovereigns, and the chaos lightning tribulation. Anyone else would have peed their pants. I'm very bold to be talking to you here."People would die for wealth!Since Tian Fang doesn't have my chance anymore, I'll ... At least get one!At that moment, Wu Shan's aura became more and more powerful.The surrounding Dao domain began to tremble and show signs of shattering.Dark clouds began to appear at an extremely fast speed.It was as if he couldn't wait!It was filled with anger!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Crimson Moon world.AI Hong was still lamenting that she could finally relax for a while. Suddenly, she frowned and looked up at the sky. She was a little confused. Why ... Did she feel like she was suffocating?That's strange!He hesitated for a moment before quickly disappearing.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶A moment later, they arrived near the realm gate.There was only one realm gate in the red moon world. Now that the red moon sovereign had left, there were four sixth level venerable sovereigns and seven to eight fourth and fifth level venerable sovereigns guarding the gate. Even if a seventh level venerable sovereign came, he might not be able to break through many gates in a short time.

Chapter 3012 The World Is Very Exciting!
"Lord AI Hong!"When the venerable sovereigns saw AI Hong, they saluted her.ai Hong frowned slightly,""Did you guys feel anything?""This ... I feel a little suffocated."One of the sixth rank venerable sovereigns muttered to himself for a moment before he spoke.AI Hong frowned. Am I not the only one who felt it?This meant that there might really be a problem.That's strange. What is it that can make me feel suffocated?He looked around. At this moment, Li Hao's group was actually not here. They were on the other side.He didn't see anything, but he didn't dare to leave. It would be quite dangerous outside the Crimson Moon.At this moment, a venerable sovereign pointed to the side and said,""My Lord, over there ... Is there a shadow?""Could it be that the chaos behemoth is trying to invade us?" he asked with a grave expression.The huge shadow was like a beast of Chaos.AI Hong also looked into the distance and frowned. A Chaos Beast?There were many chaos behemoths in the chaos.However ... They were powerful, but they didn't dare to attack a level 8 world. Were they courting death?"My Lord, should we inform Lord LAN Yue of tianlan?"AI Hong frowned and said,"there's no hurry. We haven't discovered the problem yet. If we alert the venerable sovereigns of other worlds ... Won't we be looked down upon?" However, be careful ... Inform the other venerable sovereigns to patrol the surroundings and not to cultivate in seclusion. If there really is a Beast of Chaos attacking, we have to be careful ..."As he was speaking, he suddenly froze.At this moment, the Crimson Moon world, including the mysterious Crimson Moon universe, seemed to be attached by something.Yes, attachment!As for the Crimson Moon universe, it was a secret. Under normal circumstances, it would be difficult for outsiders to capture it, but it would be difficult to withstand it. There were three venerable sovereigns here, all from the Silver Moon world, and they even had a little power of the Silver Moon.This also gave Li Hao the opportunity to lock on.The useless Dao of attachment had worked again!The underhand sun-changing technique shifted once ... At this moment, a huge dark cloud that covered more than half of the Crimson Moon world instantly covered the world!AI Hong was taken aback. He could not believe it. He recognized it ... But he did not dare to!This ... This is the lightning tribulation?Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?His expression changed as he thought of something.""Not good! This ... Damn it ... Don't tell me ... My Lord ..."Did the red moon master attack the three venerable sovereigns?Yes, that was his first thought.He knew about the great Dao Alliance and was a participant in it. He knew that if Red Moon master attacked the venerable sovereigns from other worlds, he would be killed by the chaos lightning tribulation, a rank eight lightning tribulation! This was an agreement between the two sides!This was the first thought that came to his mind when such a powerful chaos lightning tribulation suddenly appeared. His expression changed. "Don't summon LAN Yue!"At this moment, the heavens might be on Li Hao's side again.He didn't know about the Alliance agreement.However, the primal Chaos lightning tribulation was still a powerful one. As it appeared, AI Hong suddenly had an idea. It wasn't an invasion, but ... The red moon Lord had plotted against the three sector Lords!They had betrayed their alliance, which was why lightning had appeared.If Li Hao had known that, he would not have needed to worry about the two great emperors appearing at the same time. If Supreme Emperor LAN Yue appeared, she would probably deal with AI Hong immediately. The other party would probably misunderstand and think that the red moon Lord had betrayed the Alliance!It was a pity that Li Hao didn't know. Otherwise ... He might have been able to reap the benefits of the chaos lightning tribulation today.At this moment, AI Hong did not dare to inform that person.What a joke!"When LAN Yue arrived and saw this scene, there's no way you can explain it. How are you going to explain that Hong Yue was suddenly struck by lightning?His expression changed and he quickly shouted,""All venerable sovereigns, use the power of your great DAOs to resist the lightning! Hurry up!"Damn it!Of course, he didn't know who he should scold. Perhaps he should scold Red Moon Lord."Why did you go back on your word for no reason?" he thought.If you had known earlier, you wouldn't have signed it!"Even if you sign it ... You should leave Sen LAN behind. We agreed on this. Now that you've taken Sen LAN away, you've left LAN Yue behind. Do you think that you can't deal with four seventh-rank powerhouses by yourself, so you're taking three of them away?He was so angry that his lungs were about to explode!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"Eh?"At this moment, Li Hao and the others were also stunned. Li Hao frowned, finding it strange.He wasn't the only one. The others were also puzzled.The Thunderbolts appeared, but ... AI Hong from the red moon seemed to have a problem with her brain. She didn't come to investigate the source, nor did she care about them. She only ordered the red moon sovereign to resist the Thunderbolts ... This ... Did she see through our plan? According to the original plan, Wu Shan and revered sword would lie in ambush here and wait for the other party to come and investigate. Then, they would instantly give him a thunderous blow and kill him!In the end, the other party did not come.Not only did they not come, but they even reacted quickly as if they were not surprised by the appearance of the lightning. They immediately called on the venerable sovereigns of the red moon to release the power of the great Dao to resist the lightning tribulation.What was going on?Venerable the sword looked at Li Hao with some sympathy. Your plan ... Seems to have been seen through again."This AI Hong seems to be a scheming and decisive person!" Wu Shan also gasped.At that moment, he chose to defend. Although there was a big problem with defense, there was still a chance to wait for the other tier 7 to come and help!This was going to be troublesome!

Chapter 3013 The World Is Very Exciting!
Of course, in reality, they were overthinking.ai Hong was not someone who was wise and decisive. The first thing she thought of was that her boss had betrayed the Alliance and was attacked by the lightning tribulation. At this moment, what else could she do other than defend herself?He was afraid of being seen by Supreme Emperor LAN Yue of the endless sky World next door. If he saw it, he would definitely have the same thought as him ... If something happened, he might be attacked by LAN Yue!However, this could also be considered as fighting the wrong person. He didn't investigate the source and avoided being besieged by many experts.Otherwise, it would be difficult to escape death.Li Hao, on the other hand, was not in a good mood.He was a little depressed!He wanted to cry but had no tears!Are there only so many loopholes in my plan?He could see through it just because he was human?AI Hong ... I didn't expect that there would be someone in the Crimson Moon world who wasn't controlled by desire. He actually held back his curiosity and doubts, and was the first to defend. What the hell!Helplessly, Li Hao watched the lightning descend quickly. At this moment, it was not only above him, but also above Kong Ji and Lizhu. However, Wu Shan did not. He was only the beneficiary, not the controller.In addition, countless Thunderbolts instantly poured into the Crimson Moon world.They split up and hacked at the venerable sovereigns!The powerful force of Thunder instantly began to erupt. Li Hao gritted his teeth. Damn it, I'm so angry!AI Hong did not come out to check the situation!He might have figured out who his enemy was ... After all, chaos lightning tribulation was his ... Although the lightning tribulation this time was too powerful and did not match Li Hao's strength, it had appeared out of nowhere. Who else could Li Hao guess?Li Hao gritted his teeth!"We can't wait anymore! The other party might have informed the other seventh rank. If we wait any longer, the two seventh rank experts will meet up and we'll be in big trouble. While the other venerable sovereigns are still undergoing their tribulations, senior Wushan, senior Swordmaster, the two of you ... Break through the boundary and kill him by force!" At this moment, he had no other choice!Both sides were making misjudgments. It was too easy to lose contact in the chaos, so it was impossible to get first-hand information. Li Hao didn't know about the covenant, and AI Hong didn't know that venerable the sword and the others were nearby.Wasn't the sword Saint in Tian Fang?The red moon master had mentioned this before she left.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶BOOM!At this moment, countless Thunderbolts descended from the sky. The red moon's venerable sovereigns were dumbfounded!What a powerful lightning tribulation!It's finished!At this moment, in the sky, AI Hong roared,""Let's work together to resist the Tribulation lightning! Hurry up!""Lord AI Hong!" A venerable sovereign was shocked."Why is there a Thunder tribulation?"AI Hong was too embarrassed to say that it was the red moon Lord who had betrayed the Alliance, so she could only roar,""Don't worry, there's a high probability ... There's a high probability that my master seized the great Dao universe, and it's possible that he's ... Reached level nine! Everyone, this is an opportunity, an opportunity for me, Hong Yue. Even if I die, I must block the lightning tribulation. If I block it, my Lord will enter the ninth step and naturally be able to resurrect us ..."With that said, everyone felt a little more at ease.So that was how it was!The next moment, they were all extremely excited. Really?Ninth-rank?This ... Was too unbelievable.At this moment, King Huai and the others were also a little apprehensive. Tier 9 ...Because of the strange information, they were all confused. Was this caused by Li Hao or the red moon Lord? However, at this moment, he didn't have the chance to think too much.At that moment, the lightning struck!Boom! Boom! Boom!Countless Thunderbolts struck down.ai Hong was the first to be hit. He trembled slightly, while the countless venerable sovereigns below trembled. They had to join forces to barely resist the Thunder tribulation.A few Grade 6 experts exploded out crazily!Block!There were at least nine Thunderbolts.At this moment, AI Hong's expression changed slightly. She had sensed a seventh rank aura. Although it was not like the aura of Tian Lan's Supreme Emperor LAN Yue ... At this moment, she gritted her teeth and flew up. She shouted,""You guys defend against the lightning tribulation. I'll go out for a while and be back soon!""My Lord ..."Go out now?AI Hong cursed in her heart. What else could she do?He had to block LAN Yue!Otherwise, once LAN Yue barged in and saw that everyone was undergoing their tribulations, even a fool would know what had happened. He would try his best to let LAN Yue know that they had not undergone their tribulations and that there was only a small problem in his realm.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"What?"Wushan was stunned again."He ... Seems to be coming out!"Venerable the sword was stunned as well. Both of them were confused.Since you, AI Hong, have already seen through it, why did you still come out? are you courting death? Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  But you didn't see through it ... It wasn't right for you to choose to defend just now.Wushan was speechless. At this moment, he couldn't care about anything else."I don't care anymore, I'll kill him when I come out ..."F * ck, what's going on?He was also feeling a little dizzy because of this aihong!He didn't know how long his power would last, so he decided to attack first. As for the rest ... He would wait and see.This time, the fight was a little muddled.He didn't care about this. The moment AI Hong appeared from the realm gate, Wu Shan attacked without any intention of holding back. He also vented all his anger, unwillingness, and frustration!I'll beat you to death, grandson!Bastard!It's all your fault. You forced me to give up my power. How can you be so shameless?BOOM!A loud sound instantly resounded through the heavens and earth!AI Hong took a step back. In the next moment, his expression changed. He looked at the person opposite him and was stunned. It was not LAN Yue!Damn it!It wasn't lan Yue!It was ... Wu Shan!He recognized Wu Shan. In an instant, his expression changed drastically."How could it be you!"

Chapter 3014 The World Is Very Exciting!
Why was Wu Shan here?The next moment, he was even more shocked,"Sword Saint?"That was impossible!This was impossible. Wasn't the sword Saint in Tian Fang?Why were they the ones here?Sword Saint and Wushan were also stunned."Nonsense, who else could it be if not us?"Even if he didn't guess Wushan, wasn't it normal to guess that he was the sword Saint?So, you didn't guess anything at all?Then why were you so defensive just now?"LAN Yue!" Thearch AI Hong roared in the next moment.His roar shook the chaos and resounded through the heavens and the earth,""Quickly, enemy attack!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWu Shan and the sword Saint were both dumbfounded. You ... Didn't you inform them before?We thought that you had secretly informed them, and they would be here soon.You didn't inform me, so why did you come out alone?AI Hong turned around and wanted to run!How would I know it was you guys? damn it, damn it, I got it wrong!That Primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... Could it be that it wasn't caused by a sector Lord?However, since he had already come out, the two venerable sovereigns would not give him the chance. Moreover, the other seventh rank venerable sovereign did not seem to have received the news. Even if he heard the roar and wanted to rush over, it would take time.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  In an instant, Wu Shan's face was filled with joy!It was as if ... This idiot didn't know anything.A chance!The heavens are helping me!"Kill!"Wu Shan stretched out his hand, and his five fingers suppressed the heaven and earth. Clouds, mountains, and seas of mist appeared once again. This time, something special seemed to have appeared within the Dao domain.Venerable the sword did not see it clearly!He only saw that Wu Shan's enormous palm seemed to have moved something.This seventh rank top venerable sovereign did not display too much of his strength in front of Yun Xiao and the others before he gave up on resisting.However, at this moment, heaven and earth suddenly trembled!Heaven's secrets seemed to have been stirred!AI Hong's expression changed. A special power of the great path swept over her. The power of the great path seemed to have swept through her in an instant, making her feel like she couldn't resist it.The look in sovereign Wushan's eyes had already changed.At this moment, he was like a god who had seen through something. His huge palm plucked a string in the mountains and seas of clouds. He was extremely cold as he shouted,""Break four directions!"BOOM!His five fingers broke and instantly suppressed the world, turning into five mountains that isolated the world."Heaven and earth!"With another low shout, heaven and earth turned into a cage, surrounded by clouds."Block all Six Senses!"In an instant, the clouds and mist surged.ai Hong seemed to have lost her direction and turned pale with fright."Wushan!"What Dao was this? The outside world only knew that venerable sovereign Wushan cultivated the Dao of the cloud Sea, which was a change in a Water-type orthodoxy. However, it seemed that this was not the case.It cut off all four directions, separated heaven and earth, and blocked all Six Senses!Without direction, without heaven and earth, without me, without clarity!Venerable the sword's expression changed slightly.ai Hong was trapped in an instant. This seventh rank venerable sovereign was indeed extraordinary. He did not even look at her and slashed out with his sword!It was silent!It was as if the heavens and earth had been destroyed, as if the chaos had been split open, and ten thousand DAOs had become one sword!There was only one sword in the world!Duan Changsheng!The longevity swordsman!Break me, break you, break Dao!BOOM!A loud noise resounded through the clouds. At this moment, a universe of the great path appeared directly. It was the universe of the Crimson Moon. At this moment, it was as if someone was roaring through the air,""Bastard!"The red moon Lord!Damn it!Red Moon master seemed to have sensed something. He sensed the change in Red Moon and was instantly furious!Who was it?Who attacked Red Moon?Neo martial?However, there were only two seventh level venerable sovereigns in neo martial arts, and they had also left two behind, which meant that there were hundreds of venerable sovereigns. In addition, it was impossible for the neo martial human King to lend his strength to Emperor Cang, because he was being hunted down by him!To borrow power at this moment ... That would be courting death.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the tianfang great Dao universe. Red Moon master was instantly enraged!In fact, monarch Senlan had also sensed something, and his expression changed slightly. Li Hao's group had really launched a surprise attack on the Crimson Moon!Moreover, it looked like ... He might ... Succeed.This meant that AI Hong, who was left behind, was in great danger. She had to frantically mobilize the power of her great Dao and shake the entire great Dao universe.Monarch Senlan's heart moved slightly, but his expression remained unchanged.At this moment, looking at the Furious Red Moon master, he quickly said,""Sir, quickly attack the human King! We forced the human ruler to borrow Emperor Cang's power to divert the danger of the Crimson Moon. Otherwise, with the two great Dao universes isolated, it will be difficult for us to get out. The ninth-tier great Dao universe ... Will be difficult to break!"As soon as he said that, Red Moon master came to her senses. Her face turned cold, and she shouted,""Gather! Stop searching for the daosource! Pursue the killer king and kill him!"With that, he accelerated crazily, charging straight at the human King without a care for anything else!As for the human King, he had originally been rather carefree. After these people had entered, they had all been searching for Dao sources. Even red Moon master had not forcefully pursued him ... He had still been very relaxed. However, at this moment, he could not help but change his expression.Ëâπ!Was he crazy?If you're not looking for the daosource, why are you looking for me?"Hongyue, your father is dead?"The human King was also famous for his foul mouth. He laughed and said,""What, you're chasing me and want me to be your father? That won't do. You're not worthy. I don't have an unfilial son like you!""Bastard, you deserve to die!"BOOM!A Red Moon exploded. The red moon Lord did not have the mood to talk nonsense with him. He was sure that the new martial artists had attacked the red moon. At this moment, only by forcing the human King to face death and transferring the power of Emperor Cang could he have a chance for the red moon to resist!As for why the two venerable sovereigns couldn't stop neo martial ... How would he know!

Trash!AI Hong was a good-for-nothing, and LAN Yue was also a good-for-nothing.Damn it, bastard!He had trusted these two seventh-rank powerhouses for nothing, and he was so angry that he was about to explode.Was there a need to?The human King cursed in his heart. F * ck, did I offend you?You're so ruthless, but you won't live long. If you fight with me and suffer too many losses, will you still be able to seize the heaven and the universe?Did he give up?At the same time, Sen LAN also sent a message to the other three venerable sovereigns,""Come on, let's work together with King of killers. Neo martial seems to have ambushed Red Moon. The three worlds are nearby ..."The three venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed rapidly!Neo martial really launched a surprise attack!Damn it!Two seventh-rank venerable sovereigns and hundreds of venerable sovereigns couldn't hold them back?  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé They even had the advantage of being native!Monarch Senlan's eyes flickered as he looked at the three venerable sovereigns. Finally, he looked at the slightly weaker Lord of the endless sky path. The Lord of the endless sky path did not possess the power of the world, and the power of the world was with LAN Yue.Kill him!Such a thought emerged in his mind. If he were to ambush and kill LAN Yue, LAN Yue would definitely be greatly affected, just like he was back then. It would definitely be safer over there.More importantly, he was also a member of the great Dao Alliance!Red Moon master had forgotten that although he was somewhat on guard against him, the great Dao Alliance still counted on him. If he attacked them ... Red Moon would also be struck by lightning!In this way, Hong Yue would suffer the chaos lightning tribulation, a level eight lightning tribulation!They were both inside and outside of the realm .... If the three of them fought back .... All three worlds would be subject to Level Seven lightning tribulation!Because the great Dao Alliance was signed too quickly, none of you have thought about this question.He also felt that they wouldn't have any conflicts in the short term.Li Hao's side has already begun to take action, and I've been forced to come here ... But I also want a share of the loot!The Crimson Moon cosmos ... Was it really impossible to take it?Not necessarily!Even if the red moon master did not die, he had to leave the red moon universe and avoid the Thunder. He had to make the red moon universe an ownerless world and make the red moon Emperor a rogue cultivator ... Maybe he would be killed by the human King!At this moment, even though this Sen LAN sector Lord didn't discuss this with Li Hao and the others, he was still extremely bold and made an extremely crazy move!Just as the experts were about to surround the killer king ...As an ally and one of the people who signed the great Dao Alliance agreement ... No one believed that he would attack his own people. It was indeed his own people. He was also one of the people who attacked the red moon!But at this moment, he did it. BOOM!All encompassing!BOOM!He had gone all out in this sneak attack and pierced through the endless sky path master's back. The endless sky path master's physical body instantly crumbled. He was at a loss and in disbelief. Dao marks appeared on his body as he looked at Sen LAN.At this moment, the great Dao Thunder suddenly appeared out of thin air!Level eight lightning!It went straight for Senlan and red Moon master ... Red Moon master was going crazy.Ëâπ!Why?"Why?"He roared madly,"Senlan! You bastard!"Why?Why did you take the initiative to attack the people of the three worlds?Sector Lord Sen LAN rapidly retreated. He looked at the human King in the distance and laughed,""Human King, the type 8 lightning has descended. I'll leave the red moon Lord to you. Whether you can kill him or not will depend on your abilities. Hahaha!"After saying that, he went straight to the remaining two venerable sovereigns. The two venerable sovereigns were shocked. Damn it, such an unexpected change was too unexpected.BOOM!They sensed danger and had no choice but to take action ... But the moment they took action, the Alliance agreement was broken, and the lightning tribulation descended. Although they were only Level Seven ... At this moment, the two venerable sovereigns could not help but curse! "Hongyue, you dumb...Why did you sign him in the Alliance agreement?"He was going crazy!Of course, if they hadn't signed the contract with this Level 7 Expert, they wouldn't have agreed to it. However ... Who would have thought that this lunatic would rather suffer from a level 8 lightning bolt than attack them!"Senlan, what do you want?"They roared!What are you planning?Can you pass the eighth-grade lightning tribulation?We're only at the seventh step, what about you?As for the human King ... He was slightly stunned. He was truly stunned.What was going on?Suddenly, out of the five venerable sovereigns, one rebelled, one was almost completely killed, leaving only Dao marks behind, and the remaining four all had the primal Chaos lightning tribulation above their heads ... What ... What was going on?He couldn't be blamed for being dumbfounded. Not only him, in the distance, Yun Xiao, Guang Ming, and the others were also dumbfounded!These people ... Were they playing?Was the primal Chaos lightning tribulation so worthless?"The great Dao Alliance!"At this moment, some people finally understood. They were dumbfounded. Did these people sign the great Dao Alliance blindly?Red Moon master's face was extremely pale!I ... I ... I ...At this moment, he even had thoughts of slaughtering the entire 18 generations of the Senlan sector Lord's ancestors. Back then, he shouldn't have subdued this beast!"Senlan! You animal!"He was so angry that he started cursing madly. He couldn't hold it in any longer. How could he still maintain his demeanor?Can manners be eaten?I've really lost my mind. After subduing Senlan, I've been screwed over this time!As for the Senlan realmlord, he laughed lightly and looked up at the sky. How interesting. This time around, perhaps...There would be many interesting things happening.If the Silver Moon King could take down the Crimson Moon universe this time, it wouldn't be a matter of stealing or fishing for money. Instead, he would take over the entire eighth-tier great universe!I, Senlan, can at least get a portion of it, right?Hahahaha!Even if he died in this tribulation, so what? the forest world would definitely be the winner, provided that the Silver Moon King could keep his promise!Otherwise, he would suffer a great loss!"Who would be willing to be someone else's slave?"The forest orchid sector Lord hollered in rage, his voice reverberating in all directions,""Hongyue, Wushan is unwilling, but I, Senlan, am willing? You've roamed the primordial chaos for countless years. Are you worthy of being the master of me, Senlan?"You're not worthy!So, even if I die, I'll still resist you!Besides, I saw an opportunity!You can only blame yourself for being so stupid to actually believe that I would subdue you. What right do you have to make me surrender?At that moment, all the venerable sovereigns were standing in the distance in a daze. Even the radiant God couldn't help but glance at the brilliant sun venerable sovereign beside him. This day had shocked them too much!The departure of Wushan, the betrayal of Senlan, the attack on the Crimson Moon ...Everything was saying that no one was willing to be a slave, no one was willing to be under someone else!You've already reached the seventh step, and you want me to submit ... You're not qualified!"Yaoyang ..."The radiant sovereign actually wanted to say,"after this, you ... If you want to leave, then go. If you don 't, I won't be able to sleep."Ëâπ!For the first time in so many years, he felt such a clear sense of threat, a sense of death.As for Supreme Emperor Yao yang, he was speechless.I didn't say I was leaving!And ... These people ... Forget it, he couldn't say anything. In fact, if they were realm Lords, it wouldn't be a big deal if they were brothers. However, be it Hong Yue or Yun Xiao, both of them had been oppressing the venerable sovereigns under them. That's why they started such a riot.The ownership of the type 9 world had not been determined yet ... Today, a large number of top-tier experts might die!

Chapter 3016 Great Harvest!
Sen Lan's betrayal was a fatal blow to the red moon Lord.Perhaps it wasn't a betrayal, but a forced melon wasn't sweet. If you forced the other party to surrender, you should have thought of the consequences.However, Red Moon master did not expect the backlash to come so quickly.The great Dao Alliance!Previously, he had thought that it was a stroke of genius, but now, it had given him a fatal blow.BOOM!The Thunderbolt descended, and along with it was a long saber. It was an incomparably powerful saber. The human King was ecstatic and laughed out loud. It felt so good!The next moment, Red Moon master roared, and the great Dao of desire shook wildly!The entire Tian Fang seemed to be shrouded in desire. He roared,""Can you kill me? Are you even worthy? I am a rank eight venerable sovereign!"They were the strongest group of people in the world!It was possible for a human King to kill a tier 7, but to kill a tier 8 ... He was indeed a little lacking. Even if they were both tier 8, it would be difficult to kill another tier 8.The human King laughed coldly after slashing a few times. He suddenly changed directions and charged straight at the two tier 7 experts.Alright, then you'll be struck by lightning a few times first!Those two are much worse than you, right?Normally, they could kill Grade 7 experts. Now that they were being struck by Grade 7 lightning, it was even easier.The two seventh rank venerable sovereigns were terrified.Dark Moon master was on the verge of a mental breakdown. A few days ago, the human King had killed the Master of Darkness. If the human King had to be the Dark Moon master, he would have been scared out of his wits. This time ... He might really die at the hands of the human King.  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé "Lord light, Lord cloud sky ...""Save me!" Dark Moon master roared. Milords, please save me...My nethermoon world is willing to merge with your world. "Originally, the two level 8 experts were slightly moved.However, the human King laughed heartily."Alright, as long as they are willing, I will let you go. You have to keep your word. Just like Senlan, you have to integrate into them!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùIn the distance.The two eighth rank venerable sovereigns suddenly stopped.If it was in the past, he would have really liked it.Taking in a tier 7 for nothing!But now, they weren't so happy. The two even had the idea that in the future, even if they wanted to merge with other worlds ... They would have to kill them first!Sen LAN, the lesson from the past was right in front of him.A two-faced person like dark Moon master ... Although he didn't think that the other party was as bold as Sen LAN, what if ... He was a traitor?Look at how badly Hong Yue was tricked!The human King's words could be said to have hit the heart.If you come and save him, I'll let him go.Are you ... Going to save him?The two level 8 Masters looked at each other ... No! However, he wanted a share of the loot.At this moment, the situation had changed.Three grade-7 and one grade-8 had been struck by lightning. Why didn't they get a share of the loot?King Yi?The next moment, the God of Light's voice was like a great Bell."Human King, we are all masters of the world, why must you be so ruthless! I'll protect Yue Ming!"The power of light engulfed the world!He went straight for Fang ping.The human King's eyes turned cold. He knew that the other party wasn't trying to save him or deal with him. However, he clearly saw an opportunity. Forest orchid master had created an opportunity for everyone.A chance to eat meat!To a level eight world Lord, a level Seven world Lord was not simple. Although they might not be able to devour a Dao universe and world here, a level Seven world Lord contained countless great Dao power and great Dao Comprehension.If he killed them, he would definitely make a big profit!On the other side, the cloud master's eyes flickered.""Human King, we are all chaos cultivators. Why do you have to kill us? the only one who has a grudge against you is Hong Yue ..."As soon as he finished speaking, he also attacked!He was heading straight for Blue River master.This is mine.The two rank eight Masters instantly came to a consensus. We don't dare to subdue them now, but if we kill them and fuse them together by force, what will happen? can we come back from the dead?Who in the primordial chaos didn't have a good eye for things? since that was the case...Then they would kill!In an instant, a great battle broke out.The human King grunted and didn't say anything. This time, it was hard for him to get a big advantage. Of course, it wasn't like he didn't get anything. Red Moon Lord ... He raised his blade and turned to kill Red Moon Lord!I don't care!If he could kill Red Moon master today, that would be the best. He could not let this grandson have an easy time.In an instant, battles broke out in all directions.On the other hand, forest orchid master was also undergoing a tribulation, and the Tribulation was even stronger.At this moment, there were also some venerable sovereigns around, eyeing them covetously.Many rank seven venerable sovereigns entered the place and saw that the others were being targeted by rank eight or human Kings. However, Sen LAN did not attack them. In the dark, rank seven venerable sovereigns quickly appeared.p Venerable sovereign Qi Shui, whom Wu Shan had hated before, also appeared. There was not only one venerable sovereign, but several.Sector Lord Sen LAN managed to block one of the lightning strikes, but his injuries weren't light. He wasn't as strong as Red Moon master, and he wasn't even as strong as the two Type 7 realm Masters. At this moment, the type 8 lightning descended and injured him in one strike, causing him to cough out blood.At this time, if he was attacked, he would obviously be unrivaled.Seeing that he was no match for his opponent and might be killed here ... On the other side, the human King hesitated for a moment. As a neo martial human King, Red Moon was a great enemy. At this moment, he still had a chance to take advantage of this opportunity to kill the master of Red Moon.But ...The neo martial King was unparalleled and overbearing. He was regarded as a hooligan, Overlord, and loafer in the chaos ...However, in reality, those who knew him knew that the reason he could rise from neo martial arts and obtain the support of countless people was because ... He valued relationships!

Chapter 3017 Great Harvest!
He didn't know forest orchid master, and strictly speaking, they had a grudge.The other party's master of the great Dao had actually been killed by him.But today, at this critical moment, he had suddenly rebelled and killed the endless sky Master, causing the other venerable sovereigns to be struck by lightning ...In an instant, a long saber swept across the void!The saber had split the heavens and earth!"Get lost!" The human King roared.At this moment, he gave up on Red Moon master. Red Moon master turned around and ran away, not bothering with him at all. With the power of Thunder tribulation, she quickly fled into the depths of the universe. Human King did not chase after her, but only snorted coldly."Get lost! "Hong Yue is an eighth-grade cultivator. If she's seriously injured during the Tribulation ... That's your chance. For you, if you want to advance at the seventh-grade, the eighth-grade is your chance! Senlan, I'll protect her!"He slashed out his saber, and on the opposite side, Thearch Qi Shui still wanted to try ... BOOM!With one slash, Grand Emperor Qi Shui vomited blood. He turned pale and ran away!The other venerable sovereigns in the dark were also shocked!So strong!The next moment, they all fled. Some chased after Red Moon master, while others hid in the dark. At that moment, the radiant God signaled to the brilliant sun, and Emperor Yao yang disappeared instantly, heading straight for Red Moon master.On the other side, the deep sea Thearch had also been instructed to keep an eye on the red moon master!Since the neo martial human King had given up and chose to stay behind to protect Senlan ... That was their chance. The two eighth-rank Masters instantly came to a consensus. They would first deal with the two seventh-rank Masters in front of them, then think of a way to deal with Red Moon master. It was not bad to have one less major enemy!Monarch Senlan was a little surprised and glanced at the new martial artist King."Human King ... Why do you have to do this!"The human King sneered,"they're just a bunch of Rascals, what's there to be afraid of?" The level eight lightning tribulation is indeed powerful, but ... As long as you survive a part of it, I'll destroy it with one strike if there's any remaining!"No one else could transcend the chaos lightning tribulation on his behalf.However, the new martial human King seemed to have this ability ... He was also one of the rare venerable sovereigns in the primal Chaos who had passed the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.Forest orchid master didn't say anything else.Neo martial human King ... Today, he had gained some knowledge and understanding. Red Moon master was his great enemy. If he could kill this great enemy at this moment, it would save a lot of trouble for neo martial.However, the human King chose to give up in the end for someone he didn't know.Because he was the human King!Not everyone's human King, just the human King of the neo martial artists. Since his rise to power, he had been talking about repaying kindness and revenge. Revenge was best not overnight, and repaying kindness was also best not overnight!The human King held a long blade and stood in the void. Without a word, he slashed out with his blade and shattered the struggling sky waves Dao mark!BOOM!In the end, this seventh level venerable sovereign, the Lord of the World, didn't even have time to complain, because he didn't know who to complain to.The great Dao Alliance treaty had screwed them over! But before that, they were still happy.After signing the covenant, they would be on the same side, and red Moon master would not dare to swallow them up. Who would have thought ... That such an unforeseen event would happen?The human King killed the other party with one strike and stopped moving. He only looked at the two places next door silently.It wasn't hard for these two grade 8 experts to kill the two Grade 7 experts.  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé However, neither of them used their full strength.Perhaps he was on guard against the other party, or perhaps he was worried that he would consume too much energy, but he dawdled for a while before finally killing the two unwilling Masters of great Dao on the spot. Before he died, Dark Moon master was still extremely unwilling."Guangming ... You shameless bastard!"How hateful!Last time, he had not died at the hands of the human King. This time, however, he had been killed by the radiant sovereign.The radiant sovereign had a look of indifference on his face.In Kong Ji's eyes, he was a good father. In the divine light plane's eyes, he was a good ruler. In Yao Yang's eyes, he was a good brother ...However, in Yue Ming's eyes, he was a demon.Did they have a grudge?No!However ... To him, since he had seen an opportunity to strengthen himself, if he didn't strengthen himself, he would benefit others. Even if they weren't enemies now, they would be in the future.In that case ... He would just kill them!There was no right or wrong.This was exactly what Li Hao had said. In the storybooks, why did the good always end up as the bad? they were not good people to begin with. How many good people were there in the chaos?Of the four rank Sevens that had followed Red Moon master, three had been killed on the spot.In one day, another three major cosmos absolute beings were lost.The human King, on the other hand, was as still as a mountain. He didn't take advantage of the situation. He just looked indifferently at the two level eight venerable sovereigns in the distance. These two had cleaned up the mess and swept away the power of the great path left by the other party. They didn't appear in the great path universe.Clearly, the great Dao universe had remained on the other side of the world.The radiant sovereign glanced at the human King and smiled.""Human King, are you interested in ... Fighting that person together? An eighth level venerable sovereign is still very powerful. If the three of us work together, we can also eliminate a great enemy!"He could kill them, but the key was that he was afraid of some unforeseen circumstances.At that time, don't let the human King take advantage of you.Although this guy was at the seventh rank, in fact, he was no weaker than an ordinary eighth rank. This guy could kill a seventh rank in seconds. Under normal circumstances, even a peak seventh rank couldn't kill someone of the same rank in seconds. Wu Shan was considered a very powerful venerable sovereign, but he couldn't do this.‚Äã "Get lost, I'm not interested!"The human King wasn't polite at all. These two had stolen his spoils of war, and he was very unhappy. He was very vengeful.

Chapter 3018 Great Harvest!
At this moment, he had already regarded these two as enemies in his heart!Naturally, he would not be polite!The Lord of the clouds 'eyes flickered as he looked at him. He chuckled,""Since the human King isn't interested ... Then forget it!"With that, he disappeared.The radiant sovereign didn't get angry. At this level, he knew that the human Emperor had a foul mouth. So what if he was scolded?After chuckling, the radiant sovereign disappeared as well.Some of the hidden venerable emperors in the area also vanished. Some went to search for the daosource, others went after venerable Red Moon. When he had first arrived, he had been the strongest, with four rank seven experts. But now, he was in the most miserable state!The human King cursed in his heart. He glanced at forest orchid master, who was still struggling to pass the Tribulation. With no one to disturb him, passing the Tribulation would be easier, but ... F * ck, this guy is going through the Tribulation, and I can only stand guard here. How sad!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Crimson Moon.When forest orchid master suddenly launched a surprise attack, lightning also appeared on this side.There was more than one place!While Li Hao's group was at a loss, the four great cosmoses suddenly appeared.Countless bolts of lightning and Primal Chaos tribulation lightning appeared.At this moment, everyone was stunned. What was going on?p Actually, lightning appeared in the three worlds, but endless sky didn 't. Endless sky Master didn't have time to counterattack before he was blown up!In the sky above the tianlan world, a Type 7 expert's face was pale.What's wrong?Why so?Who betrayed the Alliance?Was it Red Moon master or the other two masters of the great Dao?At this moment, she was trembling with fear.In the distance, Hong Yue seemed to be not only suffering from the lightning tribulation, but also being attacked by experts.Just as he was thinking, BOOM!A loud bang and a miserable cry resounded through the world."I'm not willing to accept this ..."AI Hong let out a miserable shriek. As the lightning tribulation descended for the second time, he was already no match for Wu Shan. After being struck by the sword of revered sword, he was already in a sorry state. After being struck by the eighth-grade lightning, he was even more miserable!The next moment, a sword came!He pointed his finger!BOOM!This seventh level venerable sovereign, the last seventh level venerable sovereign of Hong Yue, was directly blown up on the spot. The power of the great Dao collapsed, and the Dao marks had just appeared when they were shattered by the sword. The seventh level venerable sovereign died on the spot!At the same time, the entire Crimson Moon world was shaking violently!Boom! Boom! Boom! The universe of the great path appeared, and a rain of blood fell.The world's top venerable sovereigns had fallen, and the great Dao was damaged. At this moment, the world was in turmoil.The venerable sovereigns were all terrified.The lightning tribulation descended again!"Ah!"  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé Their shrieks resounded through the world. As venerable sovereigns, their DAOs were too closely connected to the great Dao universe. Now that Hong Yue had betrayed the Alliance, they had already been implicated by Li Hao's great Dao lightning tribulation. At this moment, the overlapping lightning tribulation appeared.All of a sudden, many venerable sovereigns were smashed into pieces!In the crowd, King Huai and the others also turned pale!How did this happen?What a powerful lightning tribulation!It was even stronger than before, far stronger than expected. This ... This had already reached the level of the eighth-grade, right?If it wasn't for the fact that everyone shared the damage, they would have been struck to death long ago.Even so, as the few people at the very front were struck to death, King Huai sucked in a breath of air. Tsk, this is troublesome. If we don't escape now, we might really be struck to death!Just as King Huai was about to give up ...Suddenly, the realm gate opened.In an instant, two powerful auras covered the world.In the next moment, Li Hao was in a sorry state. He withstood some tribulation lightning and descended into the world of the Crimson Moon!He didn't sneak in. This time, he forcefully broke through the defense and entered!The lightning tribulation above Li Hao's head paled in comparison to the Crimson Moon 's.He turned to look at Wu Shan and the others,"senior Wu Shan, senior Sword Saint, go and kill LAN Yue!" Kill all the venerable sovereigns on the other side and don't let the rank 7 escape. I can see that the other side's great Dao is in turmoil, and the rank 7 must have fallen. Don't let that world Lord go!"The two of them looked at each other and quickly fled without saying a word.At this moment, Li Zhu was also eager to go. When he first came, he had said that he was going to deal with a level 7. Now, his chance had come, but Li Hao didn't seem to want him to go.Li Hao looked at the Thunder tribulation and then at Li Zhu.""Senior Li Zhu, go and protect King Huai and the other two! Protect the three of them with the underhand technique ... Since they haven't left, then there's no need to leave. The opportunity has come!"Hearing this, Li Zhu was a little surprised. He nodded and left quickly without saying anything.At this moment, there was something strange.Moving with the Silver Moon King was actually quite exciting, but it wasn't as dangerous as he had imagined. This man seemed to have everything planned out and didn't always try to fight the strong with the weak.It seemed so, but in reality, he was very confident.The human King had to take great risks every time, but Li Hao had made proper arrangements. Even if the forest orchid master didn't rebel, he wasn't in that much danger.This was all there was to worry about.In fact, Li Hao had paid a high price in the process. He had not rushed in recklessly.He was fully prepared. Even without the Sen LAN realmlord, he would still win today."I am Li Hao, the Silver Moon King and the myriad Dao Emperor," Li Hao said in a loud voice. Yan Fang and the other seniors, although the Sen LAN realm Lord has left, all of you should know why such a change occurred ... Everyone, come with me and hunt down the red moon sovereign! Cut the weeds and eliminate the roots, don't leave a single one!"

3019 Chapter 495
At this moment, Yan Fang quickly rose into the air. Many Supreme Emperor Senlan appeared around him. They were also facing the Thunder tribulation. However, they were all hiding behind Supreme Emperor Red Moon and did not face it head-on.Although the venerable sovereigns of Hong Yue were angry, there were many people in this group, and they had gathered together, so they had no time to find trouble with them.At this moment, Yan Fang was looking at Li Hao in shock.Kill all the venerable sovereigns in the red moon?"Senior Yan Fang, do you have any objections?" Li Hao shouted.Yan Fang quickly thought, and soon shouted: ""No objections! The realmlord and fellow Daoist have already reached an agreement ... I don't know the details, but before he left, he left a message that if fellow Daoist myriad Daoist were to come, we'll listen to your orders! However, the lightning tribulation ...""Kill first!"Li Hao didn't say anything else. At this moment, a small realm appeared on his body. He looked at Kong Ji and smiled."You and I will join forces ... Let's see, without a tier 7, who can match him?"Kong Ji smiled and nodded.In an instant, the two of them disappeared.A venerable sovereign who was resisting the Thunder tribulation suddenly changed his expression. At this moment, the venerable sovereigns of the red moon were also quickly converging, but there were always some people who were entangled by the Thunder tribulation and could not get away. This person's expression changed dramatically.He was also a rank five venerable sovereign!However, as soon as the realm of Nirvana appeared, the power of ten thousand worlds emerged and suppressed the heaven and earth. The long sword swept across, and countless Dao domains pressed down. In an instant, BOOM!A rank five venerable sovereign exploded!Li Hao had just used up some of his energy, but the power of recovery appeared. In the blink of an eye, he had fully recovered.As for the Tribulation lightning above his head, it had been greatly consumed. Li Hao didn't care at all. He allowed the Tribulation lightning to descend as he used his own realm to absorb the power of the Tribulation lightning!In the river, second cat was also trying its best to devour the power of the lightning to give Li Hao more freedom.  n0vel 0nline free at‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  At this moment, everyone was working hard.In the distance, Li Zhu took a look, feeling a little complicated. Beside him, King Huai also looked for a while, looking at Li Zhu ... King Huai was actually Li Zhu's subordinate. In the past, neo martial's greatest enemy was the catacombs heroes. The reason King Huai was a King was that there was an Emperor above him!Lizhu!"My Lord ..."King Huai glanced at Li Zhu, who was calm and silent, ignoring him.He did not have any complaints about King Huai's betrayal. It was all in the past. Besides, back then, wasn't he also acting as the whole world?It was just that he did not like to pay attention to King Huai."My Lord, this Silver Moon King ... What do you think?""What do you think?""I don't have any thoughts," Li Zhu said blandly."If you want to ask, how does he compare to the human King...They both have their own characteristics. The human King's characteristics are too strong, his personality is too strong, and he is brave and unparalleled in the world! This person ... Had more of a martial King's schemes and less of a human King's impulsiveness. As for who was better ... Who could say clearly until the last moment? At the very least, he's currently inferior to the human King. "A Grade 4 and a peak Grade 7, there was naturally no need to compare.As Li Zhu spoke, he saw some venerable sovereigns charging at him. The eyes of the venerable sovereigns of Red Moon turned red. They watched Li Hao and the others slaughter the venerable sovereigns, and some of them also looked over.With madness, anger, and resentment, he said,""Huai King, you damn thing, it's all your fault ..." Before he had even arrived and finished his words, Li Zhu waved his hand, and a domain appeared.It directly enveloped the other party!He chuckled. Suddenly, a Black Book hung above his head. The book instantly bloomed with light. Ten thousand beams of light exploded. With a boom, the fourth level venerable sovereign melted instantly, leaving nothing behind!King Huai was shocked!The judge and Chan Xiu gasped. Although they were only fourth level venerable sovereigns, they were at least middle level venerable sovereigns. In the end, they were ... Killed in an instant in front of this person!This person was so strong!Li Zhu looked around in silence. His domain expanded, and a book with a black light glowed. A powerful energy burst out instantly. BOOM! BOOM! The sound of explosions rang out. Seven or eight low-rank venerable sovereigns around him were all blown up in an instant!In an instant, they were all killed on the spot!"His lordship ... Is about to advance in rank!"King Huai was a little shocked.He was the king of the catacombs back then. Now, he was about to advance to rank-7. So fast ...
