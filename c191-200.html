        Chapter 191: Chapter 46-breaking a hundred
        Translator: 549690339
        Li Hao nodded. His teacher’s words had given him a basic understanding of the Martial Master cultivation system.
        
        A thousand-man combat was a thousand-man combat!
        
        It turned out that the team leader was unable to enter the Qian power combat stage because he had yet to achieve the perfect breakthrough of 100. He had yet to come into contact with and sense the divine decree. Naturally, he was still far from the Qian power combat stage.
        
        This wasn’t something that could be solved by mystery.
        
        As for himself, he might have to face such a problem in the future.
        
        Knowing this, Li Hao didn’t ask any more questions and absorbed the mysterious energy first.
        
        He had strengthened his spleen before. This time, Li Hao decided not to strengthen it first, but to strengthen the other five organs.
        
        Among the five internal organs, the heart corresponded to fire energy, the spleen corresponded to earth energy, wood corresponded to liver, metal corresponded to lung, and water corresponded to kidney.
        
        Thinking of this, Li Hao began to absorb water energy!
        
        First, strengthen the kidney!
        
        A man is stronger when his kidneys are stronger ... Li Hao, who had read a lot, knew this.
        
        If his kidneys were strengthened, perhaps his lower body would be strengthened as well ... This was hard to say. In any case, Li Hao had used this move twice to injure his enemy. He was a little weak himself and was afraid that others would do the same to him.
        
        With the water energy entering his body, Li Hao absorbed a little of the Jade sword’s energy. He didn’t dare to waste it, for fear that he would consume too much energy and cause the Jade sword to run out of energy.
        
        The kidney played a great role. It had the function of detoxification metabolism. When the kidney was strong, there was no need to be afraid of the enemy’s poison, and the poison could be quickly expelled from the body.
        
        The kidney could also regulate blood pressure. For people like Li Hao, the strength of his blood would easily cause his blood pressure to soar. It wasn’t a big problem, but it was easy for his blood vessels to burst. This was also the disadvantage of his weak physique and strong blood.
        
        Bit by bit, the mysterious energy was being absorbed from the human bones.
        
        After entering his body, it was quickly separated by the Jade sword energy. Then, that part of the attribute began to strengthen his kidney. Just as Li Hao had guessed, it was indeed corresponding to the five internal organs!
        
        Yuan Shuo was also observing the situation, his eyes constantly changing.
        
        He had some ideas, but it was not the time to test them out.
        
        Li Hao absorbed about two cubic meters of water energy. Soon, he began to absorb metal energy and wood energy.
        
        When he absorbed two of the four types of energy, Li Hao felt his five internal organs strengthen ... Except for his heart, he felt a little uncomfortable at this moment. His blood flowed faster, and his internal organs were stronger. Other parts of his body could withstand it, but his heart ... Felt a little overwhelmed.
        
        Bang Bang Bang!
        
        His heart kept beating!
        
        This made Li Hao feel a little uncomfortable, but he wasn’t too out of balance.
        
        “I’m lacking fire energy!”
        
        “Oh?” Yuan Shuo instantly understood. At this thought, he quickly thought of something and disappeared from the room.
        
        ……
        
        Outside the house.
        
        Yuan Shuo took a step in the air and appeared in front of Hao lianchuan in the blink of an eye.””Do you have fire energy?”
        
        “Eh? No... What’s wrong?”
        
        “I remember that you’re a fire-type?”
        
        “Yeah ...”
        
        “Then you don’t have fire energy?”
        
        Hao lianchuan was speechless.”I’m a fire-type, but that doesn’t mean I have fire energy. Am I supposed to strip away my own mysterious energy?”
        
        He didn’t bring any fire energy with him.
        
        “Strip some of it off!”
        
        “……”
        
        Hao lianchuan almost choked to death. What did this mean?
        
        I’m still alive, and you want to strip me of my mysterious energy?
        
        “Hurry up, extract a bit of it and I’ll tell you a secret!”
        
        “A secret?”
        
        “It’s fast!”
        
        Well, Hao lianchuan was very curious about this secret. He thought for a while and tried to pry a little. Yuan Shuo frowned and said,””Not enough, about 20 cubic meters. It’s not a big deal for you!”
        
        “……”
        
        Hao lianchuan sighed.”Professor Yuan, please don’t try to fool me. I hope this secret is really worth 20 cubic meters!”
        
        Yuan Shuo could not be bothered with him.
        
        He waited for the old man to strip away some of his fire energy and then quickly collected it using an extraordinary item. Hao lianchuan pretended not to see it. This old man was rich and had hidden many benefits over the years.
        
        “Professor Yuan, what’s the secret?”
        
        Hao lianchuan was curious. As for whether it was a big secret or not, it did not matter. 20 cubic meters was not a lot. Moreover, he felt that if he did not give it to Yuan Shuo, Yuan Shuo might beat him up. So, he considered it as an additional gift.
        
        However, Yuan Shuo said something that shocked him,””Your heart is overloaded! Fire energy was very stimulating to the heart! You have to absorb a little of the other four elements “energy. Even if it’s a little and it’s a little out of place, it’s fine. Just absorb a little to neutralize the overload of your heart ... Otherwise, your heart might burst!”
        
        After saying that, he stepped on the air and quickly disappeared.
        
        On the other hand, Hao lianchuan was shocked.
        
        His heart was overloaded!
        
        Yuan Shuo was right to absorb the energy of the other four elements. He had been feeling a little uncomfortable recently, but he didn’t pay much attention to it.
        
        “Five elements?”
        
        Hao lianchuan fell into deep thought. At this moment, he suddenly felt that 20 cubic meters of fire energy was worth it. This old man indeed had a lot of secrets. Any one of them was worth his attention.
        
        ……
        
        In the room.
        
        Li Hao was prepared to stop absorbing the energy, but Yuan Shuo quickly handed him an object that looked like a small round pot.”Fire energy!”
        
        Li Hao’s eyes brightened. His teacher was really amazing. He could get whatever he wanted.
        
        He continued to absorb.
        
        Gradually, Li Hao’s heart was strengthened as well. At this moment, a stable circulation system was formed in his body, and his five internal organs were all strengthened.
        
        When the five internal organs completed a complete balance system, Li Hao’s body trembled slightly. Indistinctly, he felt more internal energy, but it was not enough to break his body.
        
        Li Hao didn’t care. He continued to absorb the energy from two different sources.
        
        After an unknown amount of time, he obtained 30 cubic meters of five elements energy. In addition to Yuan Shuo’s 8 cubic meters of fire energy, Li Hao had absorbed a total of 38 cubic meters of five elements energy this time. In addition to the two cubic meters of earth energy he had absorbed earlier, he had absorbed 40 cubic meters!
        
        This was a number that Liu Yan and the others had not been able to achieve over the past few years, and there was not enough for them to absorb.
        
        Just as Li Hao finished absorbing the energy, he had a feeling that ... His inner strength could break through his body!
        
        The next moment, Li Hao shouted and punched.
        
        But it was not enough!
        
        He didn’t mind. If the first time wasn’t enough, he would use the second time!
        
        The second layer of stacking force!
        
        This time, his inner strength seemed to have been amplified. With a bang, Li Hao’s fist seemed to emit rays of light. With a punch, the floor tiles in front of him were shattered!
        
        Li Hao was overjoyed!
        
        It broke a hundred?
        
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, frowned slightly,’it’s alright, just a little bit more ... I barely managed to release it after the second overlay ... But it’s still over a hundred! But ... Why the hell did you hit my floor tiles?”
        
        This bastard!
        
        Yuan Shuo’s face was filled with displeasure. ‘I’ve paid a great price to lay the floor tiles, but they were all broken by this brat. Why are your hands so cheap?’
        
        “Teacher, I’ve broken a hundred!”
        
        Li Hao, on the other hand, was so excited that he didn’t care.
        
        However, Yuan Shuo said in a dignified manner,”so what if it breaks a hundred?” It had just broken through 100, which was still very difficult. Strictly speaking, it was not considered so yet! Wang Ming, who’s the same age as you, is already at the peak of the half-moon stage, and is about to enter the full-moon stage, which is the late-stage of the hundred-breakthrough stage! Do you think you’re very powerful?”
        
        If he didn’t give him a blow, this kid would be too arrogant.
        
        “Teacher, I ...”
        
        Li Hao was embarrassed. Can’t I be a little excited?
        
        I broke a hundred!
        
        “Also, your actual combat ability is too weak. Alright, let’s leave it at that for now!”
        
        “Try to get used to it today!” Yuan Shuo said imposingly.
        
        With that, he walked out of the training room.
        
        When he walked out of the door, his face suddenly revealed a brilliant smile like a chrysanthemum flower, and his fists were clenched!
        
        It broke a hundred!
        
        He didn’t expect that he might be able to train the next Master of the Qian master level when he was old!
        
        Although this kid had borrowed external power, as long as he could comprehend the divine intent, he would not be affected. If he could enter the thousand warrior class ... Then he would have a dual thousand warrior class!
        
        “Be more reserved!”
        
        Yuan Shuo muttered to himself, his heart filled with joy.
        
        I can’t show it!
        
        “I’m a warrior of the thousand-star level. I’ve killed three suns before, but one of them is only over a hundred. I’m just a newbie. I can kill him with one slap ...” Thinking of this, he felt a lot more at ease.
        
        Yes, that’s it!
        
        The next moment, Yuan Shuo broke the floor tiles with his foot and snorted,””Tomorrow, get someone to help me lay the floor! All changed! You pay!”
        
        “……”
        
        In the room, Li Hao felt a little awkward. I ... I don’t have much money.
        
        The teacher’s floor tiles were very expensive.
        
        Only then did he remember that he was poor. As for the joy of breaking through 100, it suddenly dimmed a lot. I don’t have money!

        Chapter 192: Chapter 47-team’s good news (1)

The second stacking force allowed the inner strength to be released.

This meant that Li Hao had indeed touched the threshold of breaking through the 100-state barrier. Of course, he would only be considered to have truly broken through the 100-state barrier when he could release his energy in one go.

But Li Hao didn’t care!

He was so happy that he looked like a fool.

How many days has it been?

It had only been three to four days since he had stepped into the tenth slash realm.

As for the amount of mysterious energy he had absorbed, it wasn’t too much. Liu Yan and the others might not have absorbed less than him. The key was that he had absorbed a lot of Jade sword energy in the process of absorbing the mysterious energy.

The Jade sword was a God!

It had neutralized the red shadow energy and the mysterious energy, so the impact of these energies was not as great. However, it had improved the structure of the energy, making it more suitable for nourishing the body, unlike superpowers, which had a feeling of overdrawing one’s potential.

Li Hao excitedly threw punches!

Five birds technique!

Not only that, but he was also trying to change the ninth-form force.

There was something wrong with the path of a Martial Master.

Every time he changed his cultivation technique, he would need to change his breathing technique.

The nine refinements had a breathing technique, and the five birds technique also had the five birds breathing technique.

When Li Hao used the ninth form force, he had to stop the five birds breathing technique and switch to the breathing technique of the ninth form force to use it smoothly. This switch required a short process.

In fact, the time was very short. The more familiar he was, the simpler it was.

However, this might be the disadvantage when the strong fought.

Li Hao thought about this as he switched between different cultivation techniques. He wondered if his teacher had a way to solve this.

The ninth form of the force did not seem to have much of an effect.

However, Li Hao could feel the power of this secret technique.

The first time he used his inner strength, he didn’t break through 100 points. He might be on the same level as Liu Yan. However, the second time he used his stacked energy, he broke through 100 points. When he released his inner strength, his strength suddenly increased and surpassed Liu Yan.

This was only the second time!

What about three, four, or even more times?

When the nine layers were stacked, he might be able to enter the middle stage or even the late stage from the early stage of breaking through 100 ...

“Ha!”

Li Hao stopped thinking about it. He would think about it after he stabilized his stats after breaking through 100. Right now, he hoped to use triple overlay.

His inner strength was more abundant than before, and his body was stronger. At this moment, he had enough inner strength, and his body could resist the backlash. However, the third time his inner strength gushed out, he was a little out of control and could not quickly stack it.

If he could not rapidly stack his inner strength, then he would be no different from ordinary inner strength. He could not even release his inner strength.

“My teacher said that I’m not good at actual combat, and my reaction speed is not good enough ... But I can break through all techniques with my strength!”

Li Hao’s thoughts were different from Yuan Shuo ‘s.

What he was thinking was that he had just broken through a hundred, so of course he wasn’t Wang Ming’s match.

But if he broke through a hundred perfection, could Wang Ming beat him?

Therefore, he had to improve his realm and power first. When he reached the bottleneck of the divine decree, he would slowly Polish his power and increase his actual combat experience. At that time, he would have time to slowly Polish it!

Yes, Li Hao wanted to use the power of his realm to suppress others!

For example, his teacher was strong in the Qian combat world. Even if Li Hao reached the Qian combat world, he might not be his teacher’s match. But what if he was one level higher than his teacher?

“In adversity, that’s a legend!”

“But it also means that the difficulty has increased dramatically. It’s normal to use force to suppress others. There’s a 99% chance that he won’t be able to turn the tables ...”

Li Hao’s mind kept changing as he practiced.

At this moment, he was thinking differently from the others. Some people thought that they were invincible in the same realm, but Li Hao was considering whether he should always be one realm higher than his enemy ... You are invincible in the same realm, but I am one level higher ... How are you going to fight me?

“So ... There’s no need to stop. I’m going to continue absorbing energy until I can ‘t!”

The mysterious energy, the blood shadow energy, and the Jade sword energy.

He had to quickly absorb and digest these things. Even if the Jade sword was about to run out, Li Hao wouldn’t feel any pity. Only by transforming it into his own power would it be his. Power that wasn’t in his hands would never be his.

……

That night, the sound of Li Hao’s practice never stopped.

Yuan Shuo didn’t come over to disturb him. This was Li Hao’s first time learning about the release of internal force, and he was full of enthusiasm for martial arts. Yuan Shuo felt that Li Hao’s future would only be brighter if he kept this enthusiasm up.

……

Li Hao didn’t collect the Red shadows in the city.

Hao lianchuan was still there.

Of course, he would go and collect it soon, because Li Hao was worried that Hong Yue would send someone to collect the red shadow. So, when Hao lianchuan left, he would immediately go and collect it.

In this case, even if Hong Yue sent someone, she would only dare to come after Hao lianchuan and Yuan Shuo had left.

Li Hao had calculated all this.

……

The next morning.

Li Hao once again arrived at the Demon Hunter squad’s base.

Two days had passed since the battle, and the team’s condition was still good. Wu Chao, who was the most seriously injured, could also get out of bed and walk at this moment.

Everyone was smiling!

This time, the battle was the most intense, but it was the only battle in the team where no members were sacrificed. This made the team members, including Liu Long, feel very good.

Not only that, when Li Hao entered the room, Liu Yan was even earlier than him. When she saw Li Hao, a charming smile instantly appeared on her face.”Little Haohao, sister loves you to death!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she was already leaning on Li Hao.

Li Hao was a little embarrassed.”Button!” He said in a low voice.”Button it tighter!”

“Little Haohao can be shy?”

“You didn’t look shy when you stabbed someone!” Liu Yan chuckled.

Not far away, Wu Chao, who had yet to fully recover from his injuries, smiled faintly.””Captain Liu, did you see him stab someone?”

Chapter 193: Chapter 47-team’s good news (2)
Translator: 549690339
“I’m afraid we men won’t have the chance to experience how he did it,”he said with a wretched smile.

Liu Yan glanced at him and sneered,”Shut up, trash! You’re the most seriously injured this time, and you still have the face to tell this old lady dirty jokes!”

“……”

Wu Chao instantly shut up, feeling a little helpless.

I’m the most seriously injured, but I ... Have no other choice!

On the side, yunyao was changing Chen Jian’s medicine. Her voice was calm as if nothing had happened. Without turning her head, she said,”Deputy Captain Liu, you’re already in your thirties. Be more reserved. Li Hao is still young.”

“Who did you say is in his early thirties?”

Liu Yan was furious. Normally, she didn’t dare to provoke yunyao, but yunyao’s words had already started a war!

She was furious!

Who’s in their thirties?

I’m just 30!

Yunyao killed Chen Jian with a single blow and no longer argued with her. After changing Chen Jian’s dressing, she glanced at Li Hao and smiled. “You’re not injured, are you? If you do, you can find me. ”

“Tsk!”

Liu Yan scoffed disdainfully in a low voice. She didn’t raise her voice because she was a little afraid of Yun Yao.

Li Hao smiled and shook his head.”I’m fine. It’s just some superficial wounds.”

There were still some injuries, but they healed quickly and he was almost uninjured.

Liu Yan, on the other hand, was so agitated by Yun Yao that she almost forgot to talk about the important matter.

At this moment, she suddenly said excitedly,”little Haohao, did you know that I advanced last night?!”

As she spoke, she was extremely excited. Suddenly, her inner strength surged and a faint white glow appeared on her fingertips. Liu Yan said excitedly,”I absorbed some mysterious energy last night and broke through 100!”

As soon as he said this, everyone was silent at first, and then they all revealed happy expressions.

He had advanced!

Liu Yan had been stuck at the tenth severing stage for many years and had absorbed a lot of mysterious energy, but she had never been able to advance or become a super. Now, she had actually advanced without a sound.

Everyone was happy at first, but then Wu Chao suddenly became a little sad and said in a low voice,””He broke through 100?”

“En!”

“This ...”

Wu Chao was still dejected, and Chen Jian, who was changing the medicine, also didn’t say anything. Yunyao sighed while helping him change the medicine,””It’s over 100 ... That’s a good thing!”

Li Hao observed for a moment. Everyone was happy at first, but then seemed to be not too happy.

He could somewhat understand what everyone was thinking.

It was indeed a good thing that he had broken through 100 and his strength had increased.

However, the stronger a Martial Master was, the harder it was to become a super. Everyone knew this.

When one’s strength increased, it would be even more difficult to become a super.

For example, Liu Long’s strength as a Martial Master was increasing day by day, but ... As long as he was unable to become a super, his strength would be limited.

It was much easier to improve the Super System.

Breaking through a hundred martial masters was only comparable to the Dark Moon level, but Wang Ming, Li Meng, and Hu Hao had easily broken through to the Dark Moon level at such a young age. Although they were still far from the Sun glory level, they had a great chance.

However, among the martial masters, how many people could enter the universe of thousands?

The difference between the upper limits of both sides was too great!

Liu Yan had broken through 100 levels. If it was 20 years ago, she could even open her doors and hold banquets!

But today ... She didn’t become a super, but instead, she advanced to another level as a Martial Master. Her chances of becoming a super were greatly reduced!

The originally happy atmosphere suddenly became gloomy.

Liu Yan also felt it, but she didn’t care as much as before. She laughed hysterically, “What’s wrong? Was it not worth congratulating? Breaking 100 was very powerful! I’m the second person in the team to break through the top 100 apart from the boss! Besides, with elder Yuan as an example, I don’t feel hopeless at all! After the Martial Master Qian battle, he can even go against three yang powerhouses!”

Yuan Shuo’s appearance had brought hope to everyone.

To put it more exaggeratedly, all the martial masters in the entire Silvermoon province would feel that there was hope when they heard this news!

Dou Qian overpowered the three suns!

Martial masters were forever gods!

Of course, if the situation allowed it, the martial masters would definitely hope to step into the superpower system. There were many sun glory powerhouses in the superpower system today, and there were also some three suns. There was even news from the central region that some supers had broken through the limit and stepped into the three suns realm!

But what about martial masters?

Silver Moon province had a population of hundreds of millions, but there wasn’t a single warrior Qian in the Martial Master sector ... But now there was one.

However, there was only one!

Compared to the upper limit, superpowers were obviously much higher.

Above the brilliant sun was the three suns, and there was still more above the three suns. As for the exact realm, there were too few people now, so the news had not yet spread.

But what about martial masters?

Was there a realm above the warrior of thousands?

The Martial Master himself didn’t know!

Douqian, if it was decades ago, was already at the level of the immortals on earth. Killing ten, breaking a hundred, douqian ... One person could fight against ten thousand? Who could become the enemy of ten thousand people?

Superpowers had a bright future, but martial masters were a thing of the past.

Even Liu Long, who was at the peak of the 100-plus stage, was eager to become a super. Yuan Shuo had also been pursuing becoming a super. Today, Liu Yan, who was hoping to become a super, had unexpectedly broken through the 100-plus stage ...

This was good news. The team had become stronger!

It was also a disaster. With more than 100 martial masters, it would be even more difficult to advance.

This included Yuan Shuo. Although many people were envious of him, there were also people who were waiting to see him make a fool of himself. Yuan Shuo had advanced to the warrior Qian stage, but it was even more difficult for him to advance to the superpower stage. The limits of the superpower realm were constantly being expanded, but the limits of a Martial Master had come to an end!

Yuan Shuo might be strong, but there was already an existence above the three suns in the central region. They were two levels higher than Yuan Shuo. No matter how strong a Martial Master was, could they defeat an existence above the three suns?

Chapter 194: Chapter 47-good news for the team (3)
Translator: 549690339
Another crucial point was that it would take a Martial Master over ten years, or even twenty to thirty years, to make a step forward. On the other hand, superpowers had only appeared for twenty years. Now, there were even existences above the three yang realm, and they were getting stronger and improving every year.

This was also something that martial masters could not compare to!

“What’s wrong?”

However, Liu Yan smiled happily and said,”I advanced!” Over a hundred martial masters! If I can break through level 100 and become a superpower, I might be able to enter sunlit soon. Why are you all looking at me with such a happy event?”

Li Hao was the first to react. He laughed and said,”Congratulations! Sister, in the future, you’ll be one of the top 100! Don’t worry too much, my teacher said that Qian is not the limit of a Martial Master! As for superpowers, even though they improve quickly, it doesn’t mean that there are no disadvantages. ”

Seeing that everyone was looking at him, Li Hao continued,””Martial masters progress slowly. Everyone knows this better than I do. However, a Martial master’s inner strength comes from the inside to the outside, and it’s a type of energy produced by the body itself. There’s no obvious disadvantage, but what about superpowers?”

“The energy of the supers mostly comes from the outside. Once they enter an area without any secret energy, the supers will be in danger! Also, there are many disadvantages to becoming a superhuman. For example, fire-type superpowers will be suppressed in rainy days, and martial masters can adapt to all kinds of environments ...”

“Of course!” Yunyao interrupted softly,”everyone knows this, but you have to know, Martial Master ... In the vast Silver Moon province, there has been a Qian Dou in the past twenty years!” It’s your teacher Yuan Shuo. “I’m not going to judge who’s stronger or who has the advantage. Let’s just talk about supers. They’ve only been around for 20 years, and silver Moon province has at least 50 sunbeams. And that’s on the surface. Are there any in the dark? Were there no hidden superpower organizations? The same goes for the night patrolmen!”

“There are disadvantages to superpowers,” she said helplessly.”Everyone knows that ... But superpowers are improving and developing rapidly. They’re also overcoming these problems now! As for martial masters, they’ve fallen day by day, and professor Yuan is now the number one in the realm of martial masters in Silvermoon province!”

However, could this number one person be compared to those three-sun powerhouses?

He had killed one of the three suns, but could he kill a second one?

Many people speculated that Yuan Shuo could kill Duan Tian because Duan Tian did not expect him to advance. That was why he was severely injured and killed. In a direct battle, Yuan Shuo might not be able to fight against a three-Sun Expert.

“Sister Yun,” Li Hao said with a smile,”even if the upper limit of a Martial Master is lower, once you break through to the next level, you might be able to enter the radiant sun division very quickly. That’s a good thing, isn’t it?” Our team has an additional Martial Master over a hundred, and we’re even stronger! This is something worth celebrating!”

He saw that everyone was worried, so he said a few more words.

Liu Yan had broken through the 100-point mark. Perhaps she was not as open-minded and optimistic as she appeared, but Li Hao really felt that there was no difference.

“You’re right!”

At this time, Chen Jian also smiled and said,”A hundred martial masters is also very powerful! The boss was above 100. Look at the boss, he was much better than those night patrols! This way, two out of the six people in our team have broken 100. The Silver City isn’t that big. As long as it’s not a superpower attack of this scale, we can deal with a few Dark Moon supers. ”

“Yes, yes, yes!”

Wu Chao also hid his frustration in his heart and revealed an ugly smile.””Captain Liu, congratulations! Our team’s second Martial Master with a score of over 100, amazing!”

At this moment, Liu Long entered the door.

He looked at the crowd and then at Liu Yan. He said calmly,””Does everyone know that Liu Yan’s score has broken a hundred?”

“En!”

Everyone nodded.

It was obvious that Liu Long had known about it earlier than them.

“It’s a good thing!”Liu Long said calmly. At this critical moment, it’s a good thing to improve your strength. As for the difficulty of improving ... Don’t we have the number one Martial Master in Silver Moon province in Silver City? Perhaps he would gain something by asking for guidance! Also, breaking through 100 to become a superpower means that you’ll be able to reach the heavens in a single step and directly enter sunlit, sunlit ... There aren’t many of them even in the Silver Moon province. When that time comes, you’ll be envious!”

He did not mention this again. If Liu Yan had become a super, he might have said more. But now, in many people’s eyes, the stronger a Martial Master was, the further away she was from becoming a super. This might not be a good thing.

“Let’s not talk about this. Let’s talk about other happy things!”

Liu Long also smiled,”this morning, Hao bu came to me!” In principle, he agreed to set up a branch of night watchers in Silver City. Once it’s set up, it’s not as simple as just having a name. ”

He looked at Li Hao. Perhaps Li Hao was the only one who didn’t understand, so he explained,””Once the division is established, the higher-ups will send down some supers and provide them with the resources they need, including the mysterious energy! That’s not true. To the inspection Division, it’s at most a salary increase, but to us ... Besides eating, sleeping, and wearing clothes, what other use do we have?”

They didn’t need money!

Even if you had more money, it wouldn’t be that useful. Money might not be able to buy the mysterious energy.

The black market’s mysterious function was to use money for other purposes, such as purchasing the resources needed by the organization, clothing, food, shelter, and so on.

Liu Long and the others were all from the public.

Therefore, they didn’t care much about money.

Once the division was established, the salary would no longer be money, but mysterious energy. Not only would there be a stable income, but the higher-ups would also send some supers to strengthen the defense of the Silver City.

Chapter 195: Chapter 47-good news for the team
Translator: 549690339
Moreover, the establishment of a division meant that the higher-ups had temporarily given up on the plan to move the Silver City.

There were many benefits!

“It’s a good thing that Hao bu has come to me and specially mentioned it,” Liu Long said with a smile.”At least he has agreed to this plan. He has a high position among the night watchers, second only to Minister Xie!” This also means that the chances of setting up a branch has greatly increased!”

Liu Yan didn’t care about this and calmly said,””Are you the patrol envoy of that branch?”

The boss of the branch, according to his position, should be at the level of a City Patrol, the same level as mu Sen.

The establishment of a branch was indeed a good thing, but he was afraid that the higher-ups would choose someone else to be the Minister because Liu Long was not a super but a Martial Master. That might not be a good thing.

“There’s no need to care about this!”Liu Long said indifferently. “Our goal is not to be in charge of the night patrollers ‘division. When the night patrollers’ division is established, it means that this place must be guarded! There was another point. If the higher-ups were to set up a branch and let others become the branch’s City Patrol, the other party would at least be at the level of a full moon! This is a good thing, not a bad thing!”

The few of them were deep in thought, but they were not as excited as they had imagined.

Only if they could confirm that Liu Long would become the head of this branch would they be excited.

With this in mind, Liu Yan’s eyes suddenly lit up and she said,””Why don’t we invite professor Yuan to join us? with him around, the position of the city Patrol of this branch will definitely not be given to anyone else ...”

Liu Long looked at her and said after a long while,”Do you think that’s possible?”

What was he thinking!

Moreover, with Yuan Shuo’s personality, he wouldn’t be able to handle anything if he really came. He might even bring some trouble. Forget it, Liu Long would rather the higher-ups arrange a peak Dark Moon expert to come.

After saying this, Liu Long looked at Li Hao again and revealed a faint smile.””Did you absorb the mysterious energy last night?”

Li Hao nodded.

“How do you feel? Do you feel the superpower lock loosening?”

Li Hao shook his head.”No. It’s still the same.”

This time, Liu Long frowned.

Even though Yuan Shuo’s appearance had shaken his resolve, that was because he was unable to become a super. He was still stuck on the path of a Martial Master.

However, Li Hao was still young, and this was his best opportunity.

If Li Hao still couldn’t become a super at the moment and kept strengthening his body, it would be very difficult for him to become a super in the future.

“Forget it, there’s no hurry!”

Liu Long didn’t continue on this topic. There was no rush for this. Some people couldn’t find a matching mysterious energy and couldn’t step into it. There was no other way.

He could only wait!

Perhaps when the time was right, Li Hao could easily become a super.

The team of six had gained a lot of rewards. When everyone’s injuries were healed, even if they couldn’t become supers, they would still be able to increase their strength. The strength of the demon hunting team in the Silver City had increased greatly. If they sent a few night watchers over, their defense would be much stronger.

But this was not what Li Hao was concerned about. He said shyly,””Boss, I’m still a level 3 patrol inspector! The appointment of the second level patrol officer hasn’t been issued yet. This time ... Is it considered a Meritorious Service? If there is, a level one patrol inspector should be able to do it right?”

“……”

Silence!

Liu Long was stunned. At this time, this kid was actually concerned about this!

I’ll go!

To be honest, he had forgotten about this. He was the patrol, and the next step was the city Patrol. If the night patrolman division was not established, he was not qualified to be a City Patrol. In the entire Silver City, there was only one city Patrol, mu Sen.

“You ...”

Liu Long choked and only spoke after a long time,”Alright! I’ll give you a report later, you’ve done a good job this time. Not just patrol, you’ll definitely be a first class patrol. This is not a problem. ”

Li Hao smiled.”Then the salary should be in the tens of thousands, right?”

Liu Long couldn’t help but feel a little annoyed,”You received 32 cubic meters of mysterious energy yesterday. If you measure it in terms of money, it’s tens of millions! Do you care about this little bit of money?”

This kid, why can’t he be clear-headed sometimes!

Li Hao sighed.”Boss, can I sell the mystery? I don’t dare to sell it. Without money ... It’s hard to move!” Last night, I broke my teacher’s floor tiles, and my teacher asked me to repair them. I went out to ask this morning, and it would cost more than 100000 Yuan to change all of them!”

“……”

Liu Long was speechless. Was Yuan Shuo even human?

You want your student to change the floor tiles for you?

Liu Long was speechless. Li Hao laughed again,””Boss, why don’t you lend me some money first?”

“What?”

Liu Long was taken aback. After a long while, he said awkwardly,””I don’t have any money either!”

How was that possible?

Li Hao looked at him and was speechless. How stingy. He was not even willing to lend it to him.

After all, he was still a patrol envoy, so his salary was still very high.

How could he not have money?

Liu Long didn’t explain. He really didn’t have any. He didn’t even look at his salary. It was all given to others. He only cared about the mysterious energy and didn’t care about anything else. Once his salary was paid, it was all given to the family members of his brothers who died in battle.

The other members of the team were the same. They didn’t have much desire for money. The demon hunting team had lost more than 20 people, and not everyone was single. It was hard for mysterious to distribute the money to their families, so he could only use money to make up for it.

The few of them ate and drank from the government and wore patrol uniforms. When it came to money, they were all very calm.

Seeing this, Li Hao could only give up on the idea of borrowing money.

A bunch of poor ghosts!

Although everyone had a lot of mysterious energy now, they found it too little for themselves, so no one would sell it. As long as they didn’t have to worry about their food and drink, who cared if they had money or not?


Chapter 196: Chapter 47-good news for the team
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao stopped talking about this and quickly said,”Boss, I went back last night and asked my teacher how a Martial Master could reach the thousand warrior realm. My teacher didn’t hide anything and mainly talked about your situation. Your power has reached the required level, but you haven’t touched the divine decree yet. So, you can’t be considered to have broken through a hundred perfection. ”

Liu Long’s interest was instantly piqued, and the others also perked up their ears.

Liu Yan, who had just broken through the 100-point threshold, grabbed Li Hao’s clothes tightly. They had been unable to become supers, and it would be a great gain if they could know some of the secrets of the Qian warrior.

Li Hao continued.”What my teacher meant was that it’s mainly because you don’t understand the nature of the nine tribulations force. In order to comprehend the divine intent, he went deep into the mountains and accompanied tigers and leopards to comprehend the divine intent of the five birds technique, which is momentum!”

“To be specific, the teacher said that everyone is different, and the secret techniques are different, so the key is to understand the core essence of the secret technique! The core essence of the five birds technique lies in the momentum of the five birds when they hunt and kill, in nature. As for the ninth-refinement force ... This teacher has never practiced it before, so it’s hard for him to say. However, he said that if you don’t understand this, you can never enter the Dou Qian class!”

Liu Long fell into deep thought.

Divine decree!

Momentum!

He knew these Terms, but he really didn’t know how to comprehend them. Even his father didn’t tell him about this because his father might not have comprehended it before his death. Otherwise, his father wouldn’t have been defeated by Yuan Shuo.

The essence of the ninth-refinement force?

He thought for a while but couldn’t come up with anything, but at least he knew the way forward. He looked at Li Hao and smiled.”Your teacher told you to say it?”

“No.”

“My teacher told me,” Li Hao said with a simple smile.”Since it’s related to boss, I have to tell him!”

“Hahaha!”

Liu Long laughed, he seemed to be in a good mood.

After laughing for a while, he waved his hand and said, As for Yuan Shuo ... I won’t bother about him. ”

He then added,”in the next few days, Yuan Shuo has taken care of some supers. We have some free time now. Those who need to absorb the mysterious energy, absorb it. Those who need to cultivate, cultivate. Those who are fine, you can go to the law enforcement team and help with some missions.”

After he finished speaking, he looked at Li Hao again and said,”you’ve been practicing the ninth-refinement force. If there’s anything you don’t understand, you can ask me.” However, you should focus on the ‘new book of five birds’, so don’t get your priorities wrong. The ninth refinement is harmful to your body, so it’s not as good as the new book of five birds. ”

He was well aware of his family’s Arts. If Li Hao could hurt others, he would. If he couldn ‘t, then so be it.

After saying that, he thought of something and said,””Where’s Heibao?”

Since he did not see Black Panther today, he missed him.

“With teacher,” Li Hao said with a smile.

That guy had secretly learned the breathing technique of five birds and absorbed some red Shadow’s power the day before. He seemed to be in a transformation period now. His teacher had left the Black Panther behind. As for whether he was going to teach it or beat it up, Li Hao didn’t care.

Liu Long nodded his head slightly and didn’t ask any more questions. It wasn’t appropriate for him to say anything in front of Yuan Shuo.

As for Li Hao, seeing that he was about to leave, he said,””Boss, I’m going out for a walk.”

“At this time?”

“Yes, I want to take a look at Xiao Yuan’s tomb.”

“Oh!”

Liu Long thought of this and nodded,””Go. There’s nothing much to do recently. Your teacher and Hao bu are still here, so it shouldn’t be a big problem. But don’t leave the city, be careful not to run into the red moon’s people. ”

He said a few more words and left quickly as he still had things to do.

“Little Haohao, do you want me to accompany you?” Liu Yan asked after he left.

“No need, I’ll go take a look myself.”

Since it was a tomb-sweeping mission, Liu Yan did not force him.

When Li Hao left the basement, Liu Yan felt a little strange. Her gaze was a little strange. This brat ... When she touched him just now, Liu Yan felt it much more clearly than the others.

The blood flow was extremely fast!

At first, she thought that this guy was so excited that his blood was racing because she had stuck herself to him.

However, after careful observation, he realized that this was not the case.

It was to maintain this speed of flow!

“The blood is flowing so fast ...”

She glanced in the direction that Li Hao had left and suddenly laughed.

This kid couldn’t have improved again, right?

If that was the case, he didn’t even mention it. From the looks of it, he was prepared to carry out the scheme to the end?

Then, she thought about herself. She broke through 100 last night ... Actually, she wasn’t as happy as she appeared to be. After breaking through 100, it would be difficult to become a superpower again. She almost cried last night.

In the end, he adjusted his state of mind and announced it as a happy event.

At this moment, thinking about Li Hao, she sighed in her heart. He had better not be obsessed with martial arts. Martial arts had no future. Liu Yan was both envious and jealous of those night watchers who had entered the Dark Moon realm at a young age.

She hoped that Li Hao could become a superpower quickly, instead of improving his martial arts.

“Tomb Sweeping ...”

Li Hao had gone to sweep the grave, and he should probably go and see that dead man.

It’s been a long time since I’ve visited a tomb!

Now that he had broken through to the 100th level, his hopes of becoming a super were shattered. Perhaps it was time for him to visit him.

Chapter 197: Chapter 48-Dragon hiding in the abyss (1)
Translator: 549690339
Within the city.

Li Hao was wearing the patrol uniform and walking on the street.

Passing by the dilapidated Cathedral, he took a closer look. Inside the Cathedral, he saw a red figure floating alone, motionless, as if it had died.

No one could see their existence.

There was more than one!

Three supers had died in the Cathedral, but Li Hao only saw two red figures. He didn’t know if the third one had been killed or not.

“Other than me, can I kill anyone else in the red shadow?”

Li Hao didn’t know, but he knew that even if the red Shadow’s Master died, it would still exist. That was enough.

“Crimson Moon organization ... Bloodline ... Red shadow ...”

This organization was deeply engraved in Li Hao’s mind.

A bunch of bad guys!

He would kill the bad guys, exterminate the entire sect, burn their bones and scatter their ashes ... He would remember all of these.

After confirming the existence of the red shadow, he was not in a hurry to move.

As if he didn’t see them, Li Hao walked past them in a low-key manner and went straight to the cemetery.

Zhang Yuan’s grave was not outside the city, but inside the city.

It was a little remote, but there was a public cemetery there with some factories nearby.

……

After walking for more than half an hour, Li Hao finally arrived.

The cemetery was located on a small hill.

Zhang Yuan was buried here. When he died, he was almost burnt to the ground, and there was no need for cremation.

Halfway up the mountain.

A new grave stood tall.

Li Hao hadn’t been here for a few months. The last time he was here was during the new year.

Li Hao’s eyes flickered when he arrived at the grave. There were flowers in front of the grave, but they were probably not Today’s Flowers. They had already withered and were scattered by the rain.

However, Li Hao was sure that the flowers had not been there for long.

However, Xiao Yuan’s family had passed away a long time ago. After his death, Li Hao had to buy this Cemetery out of his own pocket. He had no relatives, and there was no funeral.

Who would sweep Xiao Yuan’s grave?

Li Hao looked around and did not see any light. After making sure that there were no supers nearby, Li Hao walked forward.

He looked at the flowers in front of the gravestone and fell into deep thought.

On the gravestone, Zhang Yuan’s photo was very young, as if he was smiling at someone. Li Hao silently glanced at it, and after a long time, he slowly said,””Little Yuan, you told me to run, but I didn ‘T. I think I won ... My teacher killed a very powerful guy from that organization and many supers!”

“I don’t know if they’ll come again, and I don’t know if the thing that killed you is still alive ... Originally, I wanted to use their heads as a sacrifice to you, but unfortunately ... It seems like someone took them away.”

Li Hao sat down in front of the grave. After sighing with emotion, he smiled.”But I’m starting to enter this field, and I’m working towards becoming a super. When I become a super, maybe ... I can really help you get revenge! I know the name of the leader of that organization. He’s called Ying Hongyue. I don’t know who did it or who killed you, but I know that you should be able to take revenge after destroying the red moon organization!”

After saying this, Li Hao didn’t say anything else.

He sat by the gravestone and looked down the mountain, slightly lost in thought.

He didn’t care about the fresh flowers beside the gravestone.

It didn’t matter who gave it to her.

Whether it was an enemy, a relative, or the person who killed Zhang Yuan, they couldn’t bear to sweep his graves...All of them were not important.

Li Hao didn’t want to get to the bottom of it.

After sitting here for a while, Li Hao continued to climb the mountain. This was Zhang Yuan’s grave, as well as his parents ‘graves, but they were higher.

His parents died in a car accident ... Whether it was true or not, it was not important anymore.

Whether it was true or not, Li Hao would blame Hong Yue for this.

It was a car accident. Hong Yue deserved to die.

If it wasn’t a car accident, Hong Yue would have died.

As a human being, he had to have a goal and some motivation to live in this world.

His parents were dead, and his best friend was dead. His teacher had treated him well, but his teacher ... Was not his parents.

Sometimes, Li Hao would be lost and lose his direction.

Let’s get by!

If he hadn’t seen the red shadow, if he hadn’t been threatened by the red shadow, the moment Zhang Yuan died, for Li Hao, life would have ended like this. There was nothing to look forward to.

But now, the Crimson Moon had given him the faith to live on!

Sometimes, Li Hao felt that the more powerful the Crimson Moon was, the better. If it was too weak and his teacher could easily destroy it ... Wouldn’t that make him lose his will to fight instead?

Without the Crimson Moon, Li Hao might not even be willing to come into contact with superpowers.

There were many gravestones on the mountaintop.

Li Hao walked towards one of the gravestones. On the gravestone, a photo of a man and a woman was displayed. They were both smiling very happily. His parents liked this photo very much. It was a family photo taken on Li Hao’s tenth birthday.

However, Li Hao had detained himself. If his parents were still alive, they probably wouldn’t want this photo to be their last photo.

Li Hao looked at it for a while, but he didn’t sit down. He stood there and didn’t speak for a long time.

His eyes were changing.

One moment he was angry, the next he was crazy, and the next he regained his calm.

Such a complicated look should not appear in his eyes.

However, he seemed to be a little crazy at this moment.

Li Hao, on the other hand, was still standing.

At the foot of the mountain, he was still talking to Zhang Yuan, but here ... Li Hao didn’t say a word. He just looked at the photo. After a long time, he suddenly took a step forward and gently destroyed the photo on the tombstone!

Chapter 198: Chapter 48-Dragon hiding in the abyss (2)
Translator: 549690339
If there were others around, they would probably find it unbelievable!

However, at this moment, Li Hao was smiling. His smile was a little strange.

He took a deep look at the gravestone, then looked around, and walked down.

As he walked, Li Hao clenched his fists!

In the past, he didn’t care.

Today ... He was different from the past. He knew more, he understood more.

At this moment, Li Hao’s eyes were filled with killing intent!

Yes, he did not show any killing intent even when he was facing the superhuman that he had killed. But at this moment, Li Hao was full of killing intent!

The grave ... Was empty!

He didn’t dig up the grave, but he sensed something unusual. Someone had touched his parents ‘grave, but he didn’t feel anything under it. Li Hao could still release some of his internal strength.

However, when his inner strength left his body, he could not feel anything underneath. It was empty.

“Red Moon!”

These two words flashed through his mind.

He understood that his parents ‘graves had been dug up.

After the car accident, it might have been a cover-up, but on the day of the burial, it might have been touched. However, he had not paid attention to it before, and he did not have the strength to investigate anything.

It was only today that he realized that the grave might have been robbed after his parents died. Where were their bodies?

Was there a need to think?

When Xiao Yuan died, he was burned to ashes. Then, as the Li family’s descendant, was his father’s bloodline also different?

Did Red Moon collect her father’s bloodline ... Just because the small sword was with her, she needed to kill her again to unseal the small sword?

“I’m the one who’s connected to the eight trigrams! Did you contact father in the past?”

Doubts rose in his mind, but they were quickly extinguished.

There was no need to know too much!

Was there any meaning to it?

The only meaningful thing was to ... Kill those people!

After killing someone, he had to dig up the grave and steal the corpse ... This kind of person deserved to die ten thousand times!

It wasn’t just his parents. Li Hao suspected that the graves of everyone in the eight great families had been dug up.

All the dead people’s bones might have been stolen.

Perhaps not only this generation, but even their ancestral graves had been excavated!

“Since we know that the eight great families are different, that we need the bloodlines of the eight great families, that the eight great families have weapons ... Digging up our ancestral graves seems inevitable!”

Li Hao’s eyes became even colder!

He didn’t even need to investigate this matter. His parents ‘graves were empty, so the others should be the same.

These bastards!

As he walked, Li Hao turned around and went to the cemetery management Office.

In the management office, there was an old man who was taking a nap.

“My Lord!”

Li Hao opened his mouth and woke the old man up.

The old man opened his eyes in a daze. He was shocked to see Li Hao, but he quickly recovered. “Don’t scare people in broad daylight!”

Li Hao smiled.”I’m sorry, I’m sorry ... It’s like this, Sir. I’m a descendent of the No. 118 Cemetery on the mountain. I just went up the mountain to see my parents and found that their portraits were damaged by someone ...”

“There’s such a thing?”

The old man was a little surprised.”No one goes up the mountain ... Could it have been damaged in the rain?”

“I don’t know about that.”

Li Hao shook his head.”Sir, I’m not here to hold anyone responsible. The photo was destroyed, and as a son, I feel a little uncomfortable looking at it ... Sir, I’ve been a little busy recently and have no time to come and fix it. If you don’t mind, can you help me get someone to fix it? I’ll have someone send you the photo later ...”

Then, Li Hao took out a few star coins from his pocket.

Li Hao handed it to the old man and said with a smile,””This is the fee. If it’s not enough, I’ll send someone to find me at the inspection Office. I’m Li Hao from the inspection Office!”

The old man also saw his uniform and quickly nodded.””It’s enough! This is what I should do. When you get the photos, I’ll immediately get someone to repair them for you. ”

“Many thanks!”

Li Hao thanked him and said,”also, on the mountainside, the person in grave 1125 is my friend. He has no relatives or family. I saw flowers on the tombstone. Has anyone come to visit the grave?”

“I’m not sure about that. ”

The old man said awkwardly,”you know that. We’re just in charge of the basic management. Who goes to sweep the graves, which family ... Cemeteries are different from residential areas, so it’s not appropriate for us to ask. There are many people coming and going, so it’s really hard to say who goes to sweep the graves.”

Li Hao nodded slightly and smiled.”It’s nothing. I’m just confused. I was wondering if a relative of my friend has returned ... Since I don’t know, it’s fine.”

After saying that, Li Hao thanked him again and left.

In a moment of anger, she had destroyed the photo.

He was just an ordinary person who didn’t even dig a grave. Why would he destroy the gravestone for no reason?

Li Hao suppressed his anger and killing intent.

Incompetent rage was useless. It would only let the enemy know more about you. Hopefully, the other party would not care too much about this.

“I’ll kill them all sooner or later! Don’t leave a single one!”

Li Hao cursed countless times in his heart. Just you wait.

……

Once again, he walked towards the inspection Office.

Li Hao was also adjusting his mental state so that he wouldn’t be affected by this incident. He thought so, and his face gradually regained its calmness. However, the fire in his heart could burn everyone.

His parents ‘bodies might be gone, and the result was self-evident.

It’s one hundred percent burnt to nothing. Forget it, just treat it as a cremation ... But, was the other party cremated normally?

He must have extracted his father’s blood!

Chapter 199: Chapter 48-Dragon hiding in the abyss (3)
Translator: 549690339
The more he thought about it, the angrier he got, and that ball of fire burned even more intensely!

It was so intense that Li Hao even felt that his superpower lock had appeared. Only then did he manage to suppress his anger and not reveal it.

……

As soon as he returned to the inspection Office, Li Hao saw a familiar face.

It was as if she had been waiting for him.

Wang Ming!

Li Hao gave a fake smile and quickened his pace.””Officer Wang!”

“Don ‘t!”

Wang Ming was a little embarrassed and sounded a little awkward. He glanced at Li Hao and said,”Just call me by my name!”

“That’s not good!”

Li Hao smiled.”Sir, you’re a talented young man on night patrol. I heard from my teacher that you’re as strong as our Captain. No matter what, you shouldn’t call him by his name!”

“Um ... Did ... Old Yuan say anything to you?” Wang Ming probed, feeling a little embarrassed.

For example, how many in-name disciples did he take in?

Li Hao was stunned.”Oh, yes, yes. My teacher said that officer Wang is a genius and will surpass him sooner or later ...”

Wang Ming didn’t know whether to laugh or cry!

Alright, it seemed like Yuan Shuo did not say anything. That was good, otherwise, it would be really awkward.

He called Li Hao senior brother?

Although he had called him brother Hao before, he didn’t feel too awkward because he knew he was on a mission. But now ... It was really awkward. He didn’t want to call him senior brother.

Wang Ming didn’t mention this again, and quickly said, “I’m leaving!”

Li Hao nodded.”That’s what I should do. The Silver City is only a small place. Someone like you shouldn’t stay here for long!”

Wang Ming wanted to say something, but hesitated. After thinking for a while, he said,”So you know about the night patrollers and the superpowers! This time, professor Yuan has gained a lot of mysterious powers. You’re his student, so I think you should work hard to strive for more and step into the field of superpowers as soon as possible!”

Wang Ming’s face turned a lot more serious,”the matter of Silver city’s eight great families isn’t over yet!” Hong Yue paid such a big price and planned for so many years, but she didn’t make the last effort. You must be their target! As the only successor of the eight great families, I don’t think they’ll let this matter rest!”

“The Silver City is not a place to stay for long. After all, this place is too remote. Even professor yuan can’t stay here forever. It was fine before, but now that he has stepped into the thousand warrior level, I’m afraid it may not be a good thing for him to stay here.”

“I know, but ...” Li Hao nodded and sighed.

“If you go to Whitemoon city to develop yourself, I think with your teacher’s strength, it’s still possible to fight for the identity of a Night Watcher for you. Not all night watchers are supers, but they also have a logistics department to deal with some intelligence and logistics work. Anyway, there are many positions that are suitable for you.”

“You’re also from the inspection Division. I heard that the higher-ups have promoted you to a patrol ... Even if you’re demoted to a night patrol, you’re still a first-level patrol ... You’ll still be able to get a good job.”

At this time, Wang Ming gave some suggestions and said,”When you go to white moon City, you might feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable ... But people strive to climb higher. You are still young, so you can slowly adapt! After all, we’ve been colleagues and even fought together. If you have any difficulties, you can come to me ... Of course, I’m just a small figure on the night patrol, and I can’t help you much. ”

He made a patch that said,”you can find me for small matters, but don’t find me for big matters.”

He added,”there’s also Li Meng and Hu Hao. If you have any difficulties, you can go and look for them. They’re both very helpful. I don’t think they’ll reject you.”

Li Hao was a little confused and surprised.

Was there something he didn’t know?

In any case, he subconsciously felt that it had something to do with his teacher. Otherwise, there was no need for a Night Watcher like Wang Ming to say anything to an ordinary person like him.

Although Li Hao thought about it, he still quickly thanked her.””Thank you, officer Wang!”

“Don’t shout like that ... Forget it, do whatever you want!”

Wang Ming didn’t wait for Li Hao just to say this. He quickly added,”If you can become a super in the Silver City, that would be great! If you can’t become a super in Silver City ... I can think of a way to get you a chance to draw energy into your body!”

Li Hao looked doubtful, drawing energy into the body? Our demon hunting squad will do as well ...”

“Bullshit!”

Wang Ming directly cursed,”you’re playing house, you’re joking!” Liu Long and the others had already drawn energy into their bodies once, so it would not be a problem for them to do it again. You’re different. You’ve never officially drawn energy into your body before. The Nightwalker’s method is different from this one. It’s not just about absorbing the mysterious energy, there are other steps to make it easier to advance. ”

“If not, why would some wealthy merchants be willing to spend money to get the position of the night patrolman?”

Li Hao thought for a moment and felt that it made sense.

As for what the difference was, he didn’t ask. He just smiled and said,””Thank you, sir, but I can tell that the quota must be very precious ... Forget it, I won’t waste this quota, I’ll try it myself! If it doesn’t work, I’ll be like teacher and walk the path of a Martial Master. I feel like I’m not far from the tenth realm. ”

Wang Ming sighed,”you still don’t understand, your vision is too low!” Martial masters are strong, and at professor Yuan’s level, he’s ridiculously strong ... But your vision can’t be limited to this. You have to know that the development of superpower has only been 20 years, and now there’s already the existence of something that surpasses the three suns, and it’s still developing rapidly. No one can say for sure what the limit of the future is! However, there’s a limit to being a Martial Master!”

Li Hao nodded. He knew about this, and his teacher had told him about it.

However, he didn’t think too much about it.

His teacher had said that it was best not to attempt to advance and to practice martial arts first, so he would listen to his teacher.

Li Hao at least knew that his teacher wouldn’t say this for no reason. He must have his reasons.

Of course, he didn’t tell Wang Ming this.

It was already very kind of Wang Ming to say so much, and he even said that he would help him fight for a spot. Li Hao once again expressed his gratitude.”Thank you, officer Wang! I’ll remember it. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll be thick-skinned and pay a visit!”

“As you wish!”

Seeing that he didn’t seem very willing to leave Silver City, Wang Ming couldn’t be bothered to persuade him any further and waved his hand.”I’m leaving today! One last thing to say was that Silver City was really too small, with a population of one million ... The population of white moon City alone was already 30 million! People like Captain Liu who had broken through a hundred levels were second to none in Silver City, but they were extremely common in white moon City! Whether it’s opportunities, treasures, secret manuals, or secret techniques, they’re all far superior to this place!”

“Yes, I know! Thank you!”

Li Hao also waved his hand and watched Wang Ming leave.

This Night Watcher had completed his mission in the Silver City, and it seemed that he had gained a lot.

He was gone, so Hao lianchuan must have left as well.

He had even left!

Thinking of this, Li Hao suddenly stopped going in. He turned around and walked toward the ancient academy. He called his teacher to subdue the red shadow with him. As for why he called his teacher ... If Li Hao stabbed the red shadow with his sword, it would reveal its true form. If his teacher wasn’t there, what if the red shadow attacked him?

Besides, what if someone found out?

With his teacher here, he might be able to observe the Red Shadows and see what they were made of. In short, Li Hao didn’t plan to hide this matter. If he could see the Red Shadows, his teacher would have guessed it long ago. He just didn’t bother to point it out.

……

At night.

The Cathedral.

The blockade had been lifted, the mystery could be extracted, the bodies were disposed of, and the blockade had been lifted. Even Hao lianchuan and the others had left, so no one would care too much about these places.

Liu Long knew about the existence of monsters, but they all thought that monsters were just a type of power. When the supers died, the power would naturally disappear.

In the Cathedral.

Yuan Shuo sensed for a while, then pointed in a direction and said in a deep voice,””This place?”

Li Hao’s eyes flickered as he nodded.

Yuan Shuo took a deep breath and said,”how secretive!” If you don’t tell me, I won’t sense it carefully. If I don’t sense it carefully, I won’t be able to find it! No wonder this thing is so mysterious. When it appeared in the ancient academy and killed Zhang Yuan, I didn’t feel anything at all! At that time, I hadn’t entered the warrior dimension yet. Even if they did appear near me, as long as they didn’t get close, I wouldn’t be able to notice them. ”

Li Hao didn’t say anything. He took out the small sword and pinched it with two fingers.

Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes.”Don’t you feel awkward? Moreover, he used this frequently, so he wasn’t afraid of being noticed! “Forget it, I’ll think of a way to hide this thing in my weapon. Now that you’ve reached over a hundred ... I don’t have anything good to give you. Tell me, what kind of weapon do you want? I’ll get you one and stuff this thing in it later so that it’ll be more convenient for you to use.”

Li Hao thought for a moment, then said,””This thing has to be worn on my body. I often use it. If I hide it in my weapon, it would be suspicious if I sleep with my weapon.”

Thinking of this, Li Hao laughed, teacher, I’m fine now! However, can you make me a weapon and leave a small clip at the front of the weapon to lock this. At a critical moment, I can lock this thing in and only reveal a small sword tip. ”

Yuan Shuo agreed with his words. It was true that he had to carry it around with him.

Yuan Shuo nodded and said,”also, lend me that knife of yours. You won’t be able to use it for the time being. The impact of the energy is too strong. To you, the effect is similar to that of the mysterious energy. The effect is slightly better, but it’s not that good. I’ll give you more mysterious energy later. Lend me this first!”

The saber energy was of great use to him. Whether he could deal with the three yang experts or not, the stone saber was very important.

“En!”

Li Hao nodded. He didn’t say anything. He held the small sword and stabbed forward.

Puchi!

This sword seemed to have pierced through a layer of film.

The next moment, the red shadow was revealed, but it did not struggle. It was still floating in the air, motionless.

Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, had a clear look at the red shadow’s appearance, and his eyes flickered.

He could reveal his true form!

He stepped forward and examined it carefully for a while. Then, he sent a little inner strength into it. After a moment, he exclaimed in admiration,”Amazing! This was an energy body! It’s not a physical object, but a pure form of energy ... Under normal circumstances, things formed from energy can actually be seen and felt. However, I didn’t discover this thing because it has a special spiritual energy in it!”

“Spiritual energy?”

“It’s the force and divine intent I was talking about!”

Yuan Shuo examined it carefully and considered it for a while. He then said,””The person who made this thing is not simple! It’s not simple at all ... However, this thing seems to be similar to something I’ve read about in an ancient book. ”

“What?”

“Bloodshadow puppet!”

Yuan Shuo’s eyes flickered as he said,”it’s not something good. If it’s really the kind of thing recorded in the ancient books, it’s very difficult to deal with. Moreover, it needs to be nurtured by people. In the end, this thing will devour the person who raised it, absorbing and digesting all of them ... Hehe, if it’s made by Ying Hongyue, then it’ll be interesting. Could it be that this fellow wants to merge the ten thousand puppets into one?”
