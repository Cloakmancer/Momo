        oment, he seemed to know why Yu Luosha had betrayed him.
         What a bully!
         As for chief Yu, he was speechless at this moment. He knew that this old man was old-fashioned, but this was the first time he witnessed his super old-fashioned behavior. Just this ranking of his enemies was enough to make him half-dead from anger.
         On the other side, Green moon's aura exploded, and an extremely powerful aura swept over.
         Late-stage sunrise!
         At this moment, the powerful force even caused the Golden spear to shake a little. However, the old man's expression did not change as he looked at Lu Yue coldly.
         So what if he was in the late stage of the rising light?
         It was very normal!
         Both LAN Yue and Qing Yue were in the middle stage of the rising light realm. It was not surprising that this Peacock had reached the late stage. However, he was not satisfied. He only had Hong Yue as his backing. It was not like he had any real ability!
         Since when was it her turn to suppress Yu Luosha?
          Lu Yue looked at him coldly, her aura growing stronger and stronger. At this moment, a blade intent erupted. BOOM!
         The sound of the blade resounded through the world!
         The next moment, a blade light broke through the air. Behind the Golden spear, Wang Qing's face was filled with joy.
         A moment later, a tall man in a navy blue military uniform landed on the ground. He looked at Lu Yue with an expressionless face and said coldly,""Peacock, what's the matter? are you looking down on us now that you've become a superpower?"
         He took a step forward, and his saber intent reached the heavens!
         "Today, the three people standing in front of you are existences that you looked up to in the past. Do you think you're something just because you have some capital? If you let Black Widow come, you still have some face. Who Do You Think You Are?"
         Green moon's expression was extremely ugly!
         She was at the late stage of the rising light and one of the seven moons of the Crimson Moon. Even in the central region, she was a top-notch existence. Who wouldn't give her some face?
         However, she was humiliated here!
         But ... But ... She was also a Silver Moon Martial Master, and she knew how arrogant these people were back then. She just didn't expect that they would still be so arrogant after so many years!
         "Killing blade!"
         Green moon's tone was cold,"don't always live in the past!" It's been 20 years since the rise of the supers. Martial masters ... Have declined, face reality!"
         Jin Jin suddenly sighed."It's fine if others say so. No matter how useless you are, you were still a Silver Moon Martial Master. I didn't expect ... You to say the same thing. As expected, a useless person is a useless person!"
         They pretended they didn't hear the superpowers, but they didn't expect the Silver Moon Martial Master to say the same thing, and with a hint of mockery and pride.
         Disdained to be in cahoots!
         Even if the others were to say it, they would also sigh, feel regret, and be unwilling ...
         However, this person seemed to be gloating!  It was no wonder that the martial arts practitioners all looked down on this woman. On the other hand, Ying Hong's mouth was not bad.
         Lu Yue snorted coldly, too lazy to pay attention to it, and was also unwilling to mention the matter of the past. She coldly said,"I don't think there's a need to continue this pointless killing! The remains are about to open, or are you lackeys planning to take all the benefits for yourself?"
         If they scolded her, she would scold them back!
         Even if I'm shameless, you guys aren't any better!
         Didn't he also become a Lackey of the Imperial court?
         Big brother, don't laugh at second brother!
         As expected, as soon as he said that ... Even golden spear did not reply. His face was cold and he did not say anything else.
         In the past, they had looked down on the Wei Wu Army, but now, they had become a member of the Wei Wu Army, and Jin gun was even their leader. To be scolded ... There was nothing he could say, and he had long been prepared for this.
         Fortunately, it was the green peacock who scolded him, so he could still accept it. If it was one of the 36 males who scolded him, he probably wouldn't be able to take it and would feel embarrassed.
         Now, although his strength might not be comparable to Green Moon, he did not care too much.
         As for the martial masters, they continued to move forward. With a direction in mind, they would catch up to the powerful superpowers of today sooner or later. What was there to be afraid of?
         Chief Yu, whose limelight had been stolen, did not care too much about this.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After they were done, he said calmly,""Lü Yue, before we discuss anything, recall the tsunami. Otherwise ... The encirclement and suppression will not stop! Even if you come, what can you do? The Minister is just unwilling to leave the city these days, otherwise ... Do you think you have the confidence to win?"
         "There's also half of the mountain. It seems like he went there too ..."
         Yu Luosha looked at the cloaked expert."Which elder of the FEI Tian Elder Council are you?"
         The cloaked man's voice was hoarse and had a strange color to it. ""I've long forgotten my full name. It's not something to be proud of, but I do have a code name. I wonder if Yu Luosha has heard of it before. My name is Crimson light!"
          Crimson light?
         Hearing this, Yu Luosha thought for a moment and smiled.""I think ... I've heard of it! By the way, seven years ago, a Martial Master who was said to be at the peak of the Dou Qian class was assassinated. I think it was done by a strong master from Fei Tian ... I think ... It was chiming. It was you, right?"
         "As expected, Yu Luosha has sharp eyes!"
         "It's an honor to be remembered by someone just by your humble name!"The elder laughed hoarsely.
         Seven years ago, he assassinated a Martial Master at the peak of the Dou Qian realm.
         Seven years later, he was already a rising light expert.
         In the era of supers, the strong would always be strong and improve quickly. To become a flying elder, one must have some amazing battle achievements. Whether it was an assassination or an open kill, they were all very powerful.
         Chief Yu didn't say anything more. In front of them, there were four sunrise light experts. There might be more in the dark. Everyone might look down on the green peacock, but the other party was a true late-stage sunrise light expert.
         She didn't continue to fight with these people. If she really did, she might not be able to gain any advantage.
         King Pingdeng was very strong, and this chiming was not weak either. It was just that the two of them had been watching the show earlier and hadn't really made a move, which had made LAN Yue lose face.
        
         There was cooperation between the three organizations, but there was also competition.
         At this moment, she didn't want to say too much. She only spoke again,""Call Banshan and the others back and we'll talk about the ruins! The Head of the Department has ordered that he wants to see Li Hao standing here in one piece. Otherwise ... You can forget about entering the Ruins of Heaven battling city!"
         The few Sunglow all frowned slightly.
         "Ziyue ..." Lü Yue also said coldly.
         Yu Luosha looked at her.
         Lu Yue smiled,"forget it. Since you don't care about our past relationship, I'll just call you Yu Luosha!" Yu Luosha, I'm afraid that hou Xiaochen alone can't make the final decision in heaven battling city. Look, how many experts have come? Other than us, there's also the people from the nine divisions, some of the young masters on the God tier Masters Ranking, the leaders of the provinces, the nobles ... Hou Xiaochen, are you going to offend everyone in the world?"
         "Or does hou Xiaochen really think he's the Silvermoon King? When did Silvermoon become his?"
         These words were despicable!
         However, Chief Steward Yu was extremely calm,"what about the Silver Moon King?" He was the king of the Silver Moon! What about the nine divisions? So what if it's the imperial family? Even in Silver Moon, he had to sit still! If you're not convinced, you can try!"
         “……”
          The silence around them was frightening.
         This was one of hou Xiaochen's most trusted men, and he had just said something like that!
         It was simply unbelievable!
         What was hou Xiaochen thinking?
         Or rather, was Yu Luosha trying to trick hou Xiaochen on purpose?
         Even green Moon was extremely surprised. Was this guy crazy?
         Chief Yu was still calm."What are you looking at? the Minister went to the royal family and Tian Xing city to ask for a royal title. With the attitude of the royal family, they would love to make the Minister and the nine divisions fall out. Can't they just give a mere royal title?" What's so great about the Silver Moon King!"
         This was what arrogance was!
         However, his words made the surrounding crowd fall silent. It was possible!
         Lu Yue frowned, not wanting to continue arguing with her about this. She only said coldly,""Tsunami and the others went to the Cang mountains and lost contact a long time ago. Maybe in a few days, Li Hao will come back by himself. Are you going to offend the world for Li Hao?"
         It was true that they had lost contact, but it was also true that they did not want to recall it!
         No one wanted to capture Li Hao more than the members of Red Moon, and they were even more unwilling to give Li Hao time to grow. If they couldn't capture him, they would kill him!
         Everyone was not giving in to each other because of this matter.
         At this moment, another group of people suddenly appeared in the distance.
         This group of people were not strong. Under the escort of a group of soldiers, they quickly rushed over.
         A moment later, an old man appeared in front of everyone. He was a little breathless, and after breathing for a while, he finally smiled. "It's all here, that's good!"
         "Everyone ... Listen to me. Silver Moon is currently in a state of chaos with heavy casualties. The civilians can't stand the disturbance either ... The administrative Bureau has ordered all parties to stop fighting and focus on negotiations!"
         "The Ruins of Heaven battling city are left behind by the ancients and not owned by one family. The essence of the ancient civilization is taken by the present, regardless of region, strength, or weakness. No more reckless weapons are allowed ..."  The old man shook his head and spoke in front of the group of powerhouses as if he was reciting a book. At the end, he said,""Director Zhao has ordered that everyone can enter the ruins. However, the ruins are located in Silver Moon, and silver Moon is the host. If anyone enters ... They can compensate you. As for the details, you can discuss it with the night patrollers."
         "I hope all the powerhouses will think twice before acting! The director pities the Silver Moon citizens and doesn't want the war to continue ... If you're still not satisfied, director Zhao has already said that we will cross the canyon and fire ten city destroying bombs every month. Every time it opens, we must fire the city destroying bombs ... Everyone, think twice before you decide to force your way in!"
         The old man finished speaking in one breath. He panted and laughed."This is an official order from Silver Moon. All parties must bear this in mind!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Director Zhou, the three major organizations are still chasing after the centurion of the Wei Wu Army. Are we just going to ignore them?" Jin Jin was a little unhappy.
         Director Zhou sighed,"everything is decided by the heavens!" Li Hao...Made the first move, and now ... He's already entered the Cang Mountain region and is no longer under Silver moon's jurisdiction. I can only hope that he will take care of himself. "
         "However, as long as Li Hao enters the Silver Moon territory again, if the three great organizations still insist on hunting him down ... The administration will definitely report this to the nine divisions. All officials in the Silver Moon territory must join forces to kill him!"
         "Right now, Silver Moon is still the dynasty's world!"
         Director Zhou was filled with righteousness and looked around,"The administration Bureau doesn't care about anything else. If the people of the nine divisions don't listen to our orders at that time, they will be traitors! Unless this Silver Moon is really taken over by someone else, no one can change the fact that the administration of state affairs has convicted you of treason. Even if the nine divisions hide, they will still be wanted by the world!"
         In the surroundings, some of the experts in the dark cursed in their hearts!
         This old fellow really had a good bureaucratic tone!
         At this time, they still had to buy it. Otherwise, they could join the three major organizations or be a rogue cultivator. Otherwise, if they mixed around in the nine divisions, they wouldn't be labeled as traitors by the general Administration. Even if they could file a complaint, it would be a big problem!
         After director Zhou finished, he took a deep breath,"then I will stop here. Everyone, we must make peace!" Silver Moon is willing to let bygones be bygones even though the three major organizations are Darksider organizations. As long as they turn over a new leaf and repent, our agency is willing to open the door to convenience for the three major Darksider organizations ..."
         The term 'Darksider organization' made the powerhouses from all three sides inexplicably angry!
         "Killing is not the solution to the problem," director Zhou continued."The director does not wish to see you guys kill again. From today onwards, Silver moon's official arrest warrant for the three major Darksider organizations will be temporarily suspended! I hope that everyone will obey the Silver Moon laws and not make any mistakes!"
         After he finished speaking, he turned and left.
         At that moment, be it the three major organizations, the other onlooking powerhouses, or the night patrolmen, they were all speechless!
         This Administration Bureau had actually intervened at this moment. It was really ... Unexpected!
          Was this to give both sides a way out?
         Otherwise, it would really be difficult to resolve.
         Deputy Director Zhou, who left, came and left in a hurry. When he got on the small car, he turned back and looked over. He shook his head and sighed,""A bunch of boorish men. They fight all day long. You kill me, I kill you ... There's no end to them. What's the point of killing!"
         If you want to kill, just kill them all at once.
         Otherwise, would they really fight to the death when they were obviously evenly matched?
         All of them stiffened their necks, but no one came to smooth it out. Forget it, forget it. The administration Bureau would just act as a lubricant. They hoped that with this step, everyone would be able to explore the remains properly.
         Whatever grudges they had, they could settle them in the ruins.
         It wouldn't have much of an impact even if they were all killed.
         Thinking of this, the old man felt that it was better to let these bastards enter the ruins. The earlier they entered, the earlier they would stop. The good silver Moon had been led astray by these bastards!

         Cang Mountain.
         Li Hao's group moved forward quickly. Sure enough, after passing the territory of the four great demon beasts, there were only a few great demons resting in the forest.
         However, the goshawk was still in the air.
         They seemed to be following him, but also escorting him.
         Perhaps they were worried that Li Hao's group would attract the two top martial masters 'attacks again. After all, the four great demons already knew that the swordsman's daughter was among them.
         This was only secondary. In addition ... There was the inheritor of the devil!
         Three of the four greater demons were actually still a little afraid of Yuan Shuo. The image of his might was still lingering in their minds. Even though Hong Yitang had said that Yuan Shuo was slightly behind, the few greater demons still didn't think that he was someone to be trifled with.
         ……
         After walking for a day and a night, they had traveled more than 500 kilometers. This was the limit of Li Hao's group on this rugged mountain road.
         Li Hao could continue, but the others in the team couldn 't.
          As his panting intensified, Li Hao stopped.""Stop and rest!"
         As soon as he said this, many people fell to the ground.
         The high level of mental tension, coupled with the running, made many people tired.
         At this moment, Hong Qing walked over. Hong Qing, who was inside the black banner, was already drenched in sweat, but he still endured it.
         She usually didn't dare to talk to Li Hao, who was quite fierce.
         However, at this moment, she still took the initiative to come over and said with some apprehension,""Guild leader!"
         "Is there something?"
         Li Hao was a little confused. Did the second generation of martial artists feel too bitter?
         "That ... That ... My swordsmanship seems to have improved recently, but I still feel that I'm lacking when it comes to momentum. The commander is a swordsman, and the current number one swordsman in Silver Moon. Can you ... Give me a pointer or two?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's expression changed when he heard this.
         Give you some pointers?
         And the number one swordsman?
         Your father is much stronger than me.
         However, after some thought, he realized that Hong Yitang had hidden his strength well, so he didn't say much."If you have any questions, you can ask them. Not only you, but the others as well."
         Hong Qing was overjoyed!
         At this moment, they felt that Li Hao was indeed a martial arts Grandmaster.
         "I'm skilled in swordsmanship, and I have some ideas about momentum," she said hurriedly."But the key to momentum lies in the appearance of the divine intent. I have many ideas in my mind, but I can't bring them into play. I can't show the sword momentum I want ..."
         She had some thoughts about sword force, but she had never been able to truly display it.
         Li Hao immediately understood what the problem was.  It wasn't a difficult problem.
         He thought for a while and said,"it's lacking excitement."
         "Exciting?"
         "In a truly satisfying battle, the enemy is either too strong or too weak. There's no feeling of being evenly matched. That day when I fought with sun moxiian, you also saw it. "
         "That day, I condensed sword force ..."
         "You're not pretending?"Hong Qing was startled.
         “……”
         Li Hao was stunned for a moment. After a long while, he finally understood what she meant.
         He looked at the other people in the team and laughed. Obviously, these people all thought that he was pretending in the previous battle. He didn't really break through the hundred States, but just pretended to be evenly matched.
         Li Hao didn't explain anything. He continued,""Many of you lack such opportunities. This is indeed a kind of opportunity to find an evenly matched opponent, an enemy who doesn't care about life and death, willing to fight with you. Let you fight to your heart's content and stimulate what you want to learn!"
         "If you meet such an opponent, then it won't be too difficult for you to display your Shi."
         "Of course, there are other ways."
         Li Hao continued."You'll see a stronger Shi, but your comprehension might not be to your liking. If you encounter a sword Shi of the same origin, you might gain something different."
         He thought of Hong Yitang. If Hong Yitang showed it to his disciples, perhaps ... These people would be able to comprehend sword force.
         But Hong Yitang didn't do that. Li Hao vaguely knew this.
         Maybe ... He didn't want everyone in swords gate to follow his path.
         In martial arts, especially momentum, one's own comprehension would definitely be better than others '.
         However, Li Hao also knew that not everyone was like Hong Yitang. Not everyone could surpass their master. Hong Yitang's expectations of his disciples were too high.
          In fact, it was best for the earth overturning sword to personally display its sword power to the disciples.
         Hong Qing was a little hesitant, but he still said,""Guild leader, can you show us your sword intent? Let's see how powerful a true expert's sword energy is. "
         Li Hao was speechless.
         If he didn't know that this woman didn't know about her father's situation, he would have thought that this fellow was mocking him.
         Instead of learning from his powerful father, he wanted to learn from Li Hao.
         It wasn't impossible for him to reveal his sword intent. Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded."Yes, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to gain anything. Besides, my sword intent is not perfect now. If I can improve further ... Maybe I can give you some inspiration. When my teacher stepped into the Qian dynasty, I was there, and I learned a lot."
         "I suggest ... You guys wait a little longer."
         When he fused the five swords and formed a complete five elements sword, he might be able to gain something from observing it.
         "Alright," Hong Qing said."We'll wait for our commander to perfect his sword essence."
         In fact, he felt that it was only natural that Li Hao was unwilling to teach him.
        
         Li Hao didn't say anything else.
         He was telling the truth. Hong Qing and the others were observing his sword essence now, so they would not gain much.
         A moment later, everyone began to cultivate.
         Those who had broken through the late 100th stage were all busy trying to comprehend.
         For those who broke through the middle stage, they still had time to advance and enter the late stage.
         ……
         Meanwhile, Li Hao also began to train.
         When he cultivated, he could actually drive everyone else to cultivate as well. The attribute-less mystic energy that he emitted, after being extracted by sword energy, was actually a little stronger than ordinary attribute-less mystic energy.
         It would be of great help to everyone in strengthening their physiques.
         Li Hao, who had a large amount of mysterious energy, would not just leave it be. He would become someone else's trophy sooner or later.
          At that moment, he began to extract the mysterious energy for cultivation.
         His five viscera had previously reached the level of 1500 cubic meters.
         Under normal circumstances, the sword energy extracted from a divine power Stone could be used to extract close to 300 cubic meters of mysterious energy. The difference between the two was not too great.
         This time, Li Hao had collected a lot of divine power stones.
         At that time, in order to save Hong Yitang and the southern Fist, most of them were used up. In the end, there were about 160 Yuan left. According to the extraction efficiency, he could extract about 45000 cubic meters.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, might not be able to absorb so much mysterious energy.
         The body, at a certain stage, still had its limits.
         This time, Li Hao's goal was to absorb 5000 cubic meters of energy from his five internal organs, as well as his body and bone armor. His five internal organs needed 17500 cubic meters of energy, while his body and bone armor needed about 8000 cubic meters.
         This way, his physical body, bones, and internal organs would all reach the standard of 5000 cubic meters, which was three times stronger than now.
         In this way, even if the sword momentum wasn't strong enough, Li Hao would still experience a huge improvement.
         An absorption rate of more than 25000 cubic meters ... Under normal circumstances, even a top-notch rising light would not be able to absorb it. However, a Martial Master had always been in the stage of strengthening the Super Lock, so it was not impossible.
         He sat down cross-legged.
         As Li Hao thought of this, he thought of his teacher. Before his teacher left, his heart had absorbed 1000 cubic meters of fire energy and nourished his five internal organs for some time. However, his heart had been injured at that time, so his teacher's five internal organs might not have been very strong.
         From the looks of it now, it was only about 1500 cubic meters. Even if he had killed some people of the Crimson Moon and extracted the blood God, Li Hao felt that without the help of a sword, the absorption efficiency would be limited.
         If a teacher could reach the standard of 2000 cubic meters, then the heavens must be thick.
         He was still unable to surpass his teacher in terms of aura, but in terms of the nurturing of his body and five viscera, he would probably completely surpass his teacher after this.
         Li Hao smiled.
         The next moment, a wave of energy filled the crowd.
         At this time, whether it was Li Hao, Liu Long, or anyone else in the team, they were all silently absorbing the overflowing energy to cultivate.
         To them, the strength of their physical bodies didn't seem to be of much help at this moment. The strengthening was limited.
         However, they also knew about the accumulation of spirit and that it was related to the strength of the five internal organs.  At this moment, they were all filled with anticipation. They were looking forward to the day when they would be able to comprehend force. Perhaps ... They would be able to walk the path of spirit accumulation.
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Time slowly passed.
         In the blink of an eye, another day had passed.
         It was already September 22nd.
         In the mountain forest, the small valley where Li Hao and the others were located was now filled with energy. In the sky, an Eagle was hovering several times, but it didn't dare to land. It only watched from a distance, somewhat confused and surprised. Were these people cultivating?
         Such dense energy!
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao's body was constantly emitting rumbling sounds!
         The power of lightning shook the bone armor.
         The wind-type energy was also strengthening his body. Among his five internal organs, the Super Lock was getting stronger. Previously, it could barely lock the golden sword force, but now it was completely locked.
         The golden sword force could no longer struggle!
         Near Li Hao, Liu Long's internal organs were also shaking. His blood was surging non-stop, and waves were rolling around his kidney. Liu Long had tried to lock the force into his kidney several times, but he was always a little off.
         His five internal organs were still not strong enough!
         At this moment, he had yet to reach the level of force-lock, and once he did so, it was the precursor to entering the level of spirit accumulation. This also meant that this Martial Master, in terms of realm, could be considered one of the three yang superpowers.
         In fact, his combat power might even surpass the three yang initial stage.
         Liu Long was next to Li Hao, absorbing a lot of energy. Attribute-less energy focused on strengthening the whole body, and didn't have much specific target. This allowed him to absorb the energy released by Li Hao for the whole day, and it was enough to make his whole body stronger.
         But ... It was not enough!
         At this time, he had not reached the level where his five viscera could exceed an average of 500 cubic meters.
         No matter how much attribute-less energy he absorbed, it did not have the special effect of rapidly strengthening his five internal organs.
          Just as Liu Long was feeling frustrated, regretful, and was about to give up ...
         Suddenly, a surge of energy seeped into his body.
         Liu Long was shocked. He raised his head and opened his eyes. Li Hao also opened his eyes and glanced at him. Without saying anything, he closed his eyes and continued to cultivate. However, waves of five elements power seeped into him from Li Hao's side.
         It was obvious that Li Hao had sensed something and extracted the power of the five elements to help Liu longyun's five internal organs.
         Liu Long's expression changed, but he did not say anything.
         In his heart, it was hard to understand.
         He actually knew some things about the spirit.
         He also knew that the five internal organs contained the spirit. It was best to have Five Forces, but to have one force ... Would such a spirit really be very powerful?
         Even if it was comparable to the three suns, what would happen next?
         He could only continue to strengthen this force. What else could he lock in the other four internal organs?
        
         He knew that Li Hao's goal was to merge the five sword forces, and he also knew that Yuan Shuo's goal was to merge the five birds force. However, he ... Could only nurture the water force of the ninth refinement force.
         At this moment, Liu Long felt a little uncomfortable and aggrieved.
         Was there really no future for him to fight against a thousand people alone?
         Must it be perfect?
         At this moment, he thought of his father ... The second spear user of Silvermoon back then, the powerful silver spear. His father's fame had spread all over the world because of his Fire Dragon Spear.
         "So ... The ninth-form force doesn't mean that one can only sense water force. Perhaps ... One force can also be divided into Five Forces!"
         Liu Long thought in his heart, but he could only think about it. In the end, he sighed. The current him did not have such insights and gains. It was impossible for him to transform his Shi into five Shi out of thin air.
         Let's talk about it after entering the spirit accumulation stage.
         He no longer thought about it, nor did he care about the energy that was flowing into his body. He kept what Li Hao gave him.
         As Li Hao grew stronger, the opponents he encountered became more and more terrifying.
          As a warrior master, although he had made rapid progress and could even deal with the late stage or even the peak of the sunlit realm, it was still far from enough!
         If he could lock the water force in his kidney this time, perhaps he could deal with the three yang.
         ……
         Li Hao was also cultivating. While he was cultivating, he noticed Liu Long's condition and gave some of the five elements to him.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After that, Li Hao didn't care anymore.
         The team leader knew how to lock down the enemy's momentum, but it was hard to say if he would succeed.
         After all, the captain had only been in the thousand combat division for a short time, and unlike Li Hao, he didn't have a sword that could be used as a cheating device. A large amount of sword energy had made Li Hao's body stronger than expected, perhaps only second to the current Southern Fist.
         Nanquan's powerful qi and blood meant that his body wasn't too weak. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to withstand the powerful qi and blood.
         The mysterious energy was absorbed, extracted, and digested by Li Hao ...
         The divine power stones were also breaking.
         A large amount of energy surged into Li Hao's body.
         His five internal organs were rapidly strengthening.
         ……
         In the blink of an eye, another day had passed.
         In the group, many people were already full. At this moment, they walked out of the cultivation circle to practice their fist techniques and sword techniques ...
         Some of the martial masters who had broken through the middle stage of the 100-odd years were constantly consuming their energy. They only wanted to go in and absorb a little more. Perhaps they could enter the late stage. In the past two days, many martial masters had entered the late stage.
         In the team, other than Li Hao and Liu Long, there were 49 martial masters. Currently, more than 30 of them were in the late-stage of breaking through 100, while a small number of martial masters were still in the mid-stage.
         In the later stage of the bag opening realm, inner strength could be released from the head, but it was still difficult for some people.
         But originally, these people were only at the tenth realm.
         They only left white moon City with Li Hao on the 15th of September. It was now the 23rd of September. In less than ten days, they had improved rapidly.
         In the team, a few martial masters who had broken through the late-stage 100 were also working hard.
         This included Li Heng, Wu Chao, and even Chen Jian, who were originally in the middle stage ...
         These people were all working hard in the direction of gathering momentum.  Liu Yan, who was already in the late stage, was also constantly brandishing her twin daggers. In the team, there was no communication at all except for the sound of martial arts practice. From time to time, everyone would glance at Li Hao, who was still frantically absorbing energy.
         At this moment, apart from Li Hao, only Liu Long could continue to absorb energy.
         As for Liu Long, the sound of chains being dragged could be heard from time to time, causing some people to be filled with doubt.
         The sound of chains!
         Where did the sound of chains come from?
         As for the accumulation of spirit, these people had no way of coming into contact with it. It was still a long way from them.
         This was perhaps the longest time Li Hao had ever spent absorbing a superpower.
         ……
         Until 24th of September.
         The sky was already dark. Li Hao let out a long breath and opened his eyes.
         Three days and three nights!
         The continuous absorption of the mysterious energy made him feel like he had been reborn.
         Sensing the strength of his five internal organs, he found that they were almost 5000 cubic meters. At this moment, Li Hao even felt that his five animal technique might not be weaker than his sword force.
         Shi didn't increase by much, but it felt a little full.
         This time, he consumed a lot of mysterious energy. Li Hao himself consumed more than 20000 cubic meters, and Liu Long, who was beside him, also absorbed thousands of cubic meters of five elements energy under his care.
         In total, he had consumed close to 30000 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
         He had also used up 110 divine power stones.
         There were only about 50 divine power stones left in the storage ring, but there was still quite a lot of mysterious energy, more than 40000 cubic meters, and various attributes.
         Li Hao stood up and took a deep breath.
         A punch was thrown!
         BOOM!
         A loud noise rang out. The power was slightly greater than expected, but Li Hao frowned slightly. The explosive power ... Was not as strong as expected.
          He sensed it carefully ... This time, he found some problems.
         His five internal organs were too strong, his body was very strong, and his bones and bones were not weak either. However, his qi and blood had become his shortcoming, and he could not keep up. When his body's five internal organs were strengthened, his qi and blood would also be strengthened.
         However, the speed of strengthening could not keep up with the rhythm.
         "Southern Fist ..."
         He thought of the extremely powerful qi and blood power of the southern Fist, which was more than a level stronger than his own.
         How did the southern Fist achieve such a powerful qi and blood despite having ordinary internal organs?
         His body was now extremely strong, but as his body grew stronger, Li Hao also discovered that there were too many areas in the human body that could be strengthened. If he didn't want to leave any shortcomings ... It was almost impossible.
         No wonder those martial masters all walked their own paths.
         He had to have strong qi and blood, strong physical body, strong sword force, or strong saber intent ...
         Hong Yitang's sword force was very strong, and his body wasn't weak either. However, even someone as strong as Hong Yitang seemed to only be strong in his body and sword force, not his five internal organs.
        
         There were also huge shortcomings.
         "It's too difficult to be an all-rounder as a Martial Master. "
         Li Hao sighed inwardly. With a light wave of his hand, the golden sword force burst forth. The instantaneous burst of golden sword force should have broken through Li Hao's body, but this time, it burst out from his fingertips.
         This time, only his finger was bleeding.
         In the past, his entire finger would have been blown up.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao familiarized himself with the new power. He didn't lose control of it, but he was still unfamiliar with it. As he got used to it, his control over the new power gradually reached a point where he could do as he pleased.
         His strong body even led to the development of the ninth-refinement force.
         Li Hao's muscles wriggled as he lightly punched out. Once, twice ... In an instant, he punched out eight times.
         The eighth fold was no longer a burden to him.
         However, the ninth fold still did not appear.
          Li Hao slightly frowned and punched again. Once, twice ... Or eight times.
         He kept trying, and not far away, the sound of chains could still be heard from Liu Long's body. That was the sound of him constantly suppressing the water wave force. It seemed like he had entered the locking force stage. Once he managed to lock the water wave force, he would be considered to have stepped into the spirit accumulation stage.
         However, Li Hao didn't know what Liu Long's next step would be.
         He could only strengthen it first.
         Back then, his teacher had tried to figure out the way to accumulate spirit according to his cultivation technique. Li Hao didn't have the ability to overthrow some of his teacher's ideas or change some of his cultivation methods. For example, the five internal organs could accumulate one force. Li Hao had thought about it, but he didn't know how to do it.
         He didn't care about Liu Long anymore and kept punching, again and again.
         When the sky was completely dark, Li Hao punched out. Indistinctly, a Ninth Wave appeared ... But it still felt a little lacking and not as smooth as before.
         Li Hao, however, smiled.
         Not bad!
         It was enough. This meant that he could make the ninth fold. However, he was not skilled enough. He needed more time to master it. As long as he persevered, he would be able to complete the ninth-stage of the refined force in no time.
         At this time, Li Hao walked to Li Heng, who was practicing martial arts in the distance.
         Li Heng was originally practicing his swordsmanship. When he felt someone behind him, he turned around and was shocked. He hurriedly stopped his cultivation."Guild leader!"
         Li Hao nodded slightly and smiled.""Not bad swordsmanship. Willow catkin
         Li Heng revealed a smile, but it was hidden under his black cloak.
         "Guild leader has good eyes. The catkin sword is very strong, it's just that ... I haven't trained it to perfection."
         "Is the Willow catkin sword divided into different levels?" Li Hao asked curiously.
          "Mm, split!"  Li Heng didn't hide anything. Seeing that Li Hao was in the mood to chat with him, he tried to figure out Li Hao's thoughts while saying,""The Willow silk sword actually doesn't have many layers, only four in total."
         "The first level is the basic entry. You'll have reached it once you learn the breathing technique and the sword move."
         "The second level, inner strength transforming into swords. This is a little difficult ..."
         Li Hao nodded and thought, that's quite impressive!
         He had only managed to transform his inner strength into a sword when he had broken through 100 levels of perfection. It was precisely because he had completed this that he had stepped into the great circle.
         Obviously, this level's upper class required the strength to break through 100 perfection, and Li Heng seemed to be lacking a little.
         "At the completion of the second level, there's a chance to naturally comprehend sword force."
         "I think I'm almost there ... However, even if I can successfully transform my internal energy into a sword, I'm still far from mastering the Willow silk sword." Li Heng smiled.
         "The third level, the sharp sword has no edge!"
         "The fourth level, willow catkins follow the wind!"
         Li Heng laughed dryly."I didn't say this. It's recorded in the secret technique. If you succeed in the third level, it means that even if you hold a sword without a edge, you can still exert the sharpest effect. This is also the core pursuit of the Willow catkin sword. The Willow catkin sword is created by imitating the Willow branches and the floating willow catkins. At its peak, it'll be like the Willow catkins. With the wind blowing, it'll drift with the wind. Wherever it flies, it'll kill. Wherever there's willow catkins, there'll be sword intent ..."
         Li Hao nodded. After thinking carefully, he realized that this state must be very powerful.
         They were like willow catkins, light and floating. When they moved with the wind, wouldn't it feel like ten thousand swords had shot out at the same time?
         "Can you teach this secret technique to others?"
         Li Heng was stunned. Spread?
          Hesitating, he glanced at Li Hao and said,""Guild leader, you mean ..."
         "I want to learn."
         Li Heng was stunned. Although the Willow silk sword wasn't weak, it wasn't even at The Seventh Sword.
         Where's Li Hao?
         He knew the five birds technique, the Shadowless Sword, and the nine-refined force ... These were all passed down from the 36 heroes back then. The strength of these people proved the power of their cultivation techniques.
         It was not always better to have more secret skills.
         Moreover, there was also the successor of the earth overturning sword here. The earth overturning sword was also much more famous than the Willow catkin sword.
         He gave up on learning the overlaid sword and wanted to learn the catkin sword from her?
         While Li Heng was thinking, Li Hao said,"you're probably the only successor of the Willow catkin sword, which is equivalent to the leader of the branch of the Willow catkin sword. You're qualified to inherit it." "Of course, I won't force you. You can state your conditions, or you can't tell anyone ... It's fine. As a Martial Master, it's a basic requirement that our sect's core secret techniques are not taught to outsiders. I won't hold a grudge over this, so you can rest assured. "
         Li Heng laughed drily."That's not what I meant ... It's just ... It's just ... Leader, you know so many secret techniques. Why do you want to learn the catkin sword? if I remember correctly, you also know the Shadowless Sword, right?"
        
         "Yes."
         "The Shadowless Sword is far more famous than the catkin sword."
         ,m "I'm useful,"  Li Hao said a few simple words, and Li Heng pondered for a moment before saying,""To tell you the truth, my cheap master died not long after he taught me. Before he left the silver Blizzard city, he did say that he didn't want the legacy of the Willow catkin sword to be lost ... But ..."
         Li Heng steeled his heart, gritted his teeth, and said,""However, you need to be a disciple of our sect! Guild leader, if you want to learn, it's not difficult ... But ... But you have to become a disciple of my Willow silk sword branch!"
         Frowning, Li Hao thought for a while and said,""Is being an in-name disciple okay? I don't want to learn the third or fourth level. I only want to learn the second level, the unique inner strength sword technique. "
         An in-name disciple!
         Li Heng pondered for a moment and nodded. "It's fine if you don't want to learn the latter part, but ... You won't have the essence of the catkin sword, so you can only learn the general idea. "
         This was equivalent to Wang Ming and the others getting the basic five birds breathing technique, and not the five birds breathing technique. In-name disciples couldn't learn the core.
         Li Hao didn't care. He explained,""My teacher is still alive, and the five birds sect is still around. If my teacher is no longer around, I don't care. I don't even care if I become the core disciple of the Willow catkin sword ... Now, unless my teacher is killed in the central region, otherwise ... I can only be an in-name disciple."
          “……”
         These words sounded a little awkward.
         Li Heng thought to himself,'are you hoping that your teacher will be beaten to death or not?'
         "Also," Li Hao said,"I won't take it for free. Even if I become an in-name disciple, I don't want to be your ... Or your teacher's in-name disciple. Can you take me in on behalf of your Grandmaster?"
         “……”
         Li Heng was stunned for a moment. This works too?
         Li Hao explained,"I'm not taking advantage of you. It's because my teacher and your teacher are of the same generation. Liu Xu sword and five bird King are of the same generation." If you take me in as an in-name disciple, then ... My seniority doesn't matter, but it will lower my teacher's seniority. These senior martial masters care more about this. "
         "If I were to become Liu Xu Jian's disciple in name, then this problem wouldn't exist."
         Li Heng felt helpless. There would be a problem. He ... Would have another martial uncle!
         However, on second thought, it was not a loss.
         Even if Liu Xu Jian was still alive and knew about Li Hao's situation, he wouldn't care even if Li Hao became a core disciple, let alone an in-name disciple.
         How good would it be for a swordsman who had comprehended many sword forces to join the Willow catkin sword branch!
         Li Hao continued,"in order to let the catkin sword rest in peace, I can provide the sect with 5000 cubic meters of mysterious energy and 10 divine power stones."
         “……”
         Li Heng was dumbfounded.
         It's only the first two levels of the cultivation technique, do you have to give so much?
         Could it be that the first and second levels of the Willow catkin sword technique were peerless secret manuals?  He couldn't figure it out, but after some consideration, he nodded.""I can ...... But, guild leader, giving so many things, you ...... Are not taking special care of me, right? Is it because I'm too talented, so you don't want to hold me back?"
         Li Hao was stunned.
         Why would this fellow have such a thought?
         At this moment, Li Heng was certain of this. Thinking of this, he said, somewhat touched,""Leader, you don't have to do this. Even if I'm talented, I've been delayed for a few years. There are people in the group who are younger than me and have more prospects ... It's not appropriate to waste so much on me alone. It will also make others feel unfair ..."
         Li Hao silently watched his performance. After a while, he said,""I need the catkin sword to perfect my sword force. It ... Has nothing to do with you."
         Li Heng was stunned and speechless.
         Is that true?
         Forget it, he was too lazy to think about it. He nodded and said,""Alright then, leader. If you insist on giving it to me, then I'll take it."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com 5000 cubic meters of mysterious energy for 10 divine power stones was a sky-high price!
         It would be worth it even if he were to teach them all, let alone just the first two levels.
         However, Li Hao wanted to follow the rules of the martial arts world and was unwilling to join the Willow silk school. Li Heng didn't say anything more and quickly told Li Hao some of the basic contents of the first and second levels, including the core breathing technique.
         It wasn't too difficult. Li Hao's memory was very good, so he instantly memorized it.
         Li Heng showed him a few more times, and Li Hao quickly understood the core of the Willow silk sword. However, the stage of transforming his internal energy into a sword might be a bit troublesome, as Li Hao had already transformed his internal energy into a sword once before.
         This time, he might need to find another way to complete the second level of the Willow silk sword.
         As for whether or not he could comprehend wood sword force after he succeeded, Li Hao wasn't too sure.
         While they were learning and teaching, the sound of chains rattling could be heard in the distance.
          The next moment, a loud roar was heard!
         There was no blood at the corner of Liu Long's mouth, but there was a slight pain in his kidney. At this moment, he frowned and roared. In the next second, he stood up and punched out!
         There was a loud boom!
         A powerful wave instantly swept across the world.
         In the blink of an eye, the waves exploded!
         At the moment of explosion, a chain broke out of the waves and pierced the void.
         Liu Long let out a long breath, and everyone around him also looked on in horror.
         This explosive power seemed to be much stronger than before.
         As for Li Hao, he also quickly rushed over. He glanced at Liu Long and suddenly sighed.
         Liu Long was a little confused. Wasn't this something to be happy about?
        
         He had succeeded in accumulating his spirit lock force!
         Although he only had one force and his five internal organs were not as strong as Yuan Shuo 's, so his combat power was definitely not as strong as Yuan Shuo's when he had just accumulated spirit. However, no matter what, he was already at the accumulation spirit. At this moment, Liu Long felt that he could deal with the three suns!
         You've improved so much in such a short time. Why are you sighing?
         Li Hao, on the other hand, hesitated. After a while, he chose to send a message."Boss, in the future ... You should strengthen your kidney more. Your kidney can't withstand the impact of the waves, maybe ... Sigh!"
         His kidney was lacking!
         Only then did Liu Long come back to his senses. He was a little speechless. He glanced at Li Hao. This brat was actually thinking about this at this moment. F * ck, is there something wrong with him?
         He was able to transmit his voice now, so he said,""Don't think too much. As a Martial Master ..."
         "Even so, we still need to carry on our ancestral line and find a wife!"
         Li Hao interrupted him. Poor boss. He had to use water force first, but his kidney was not strong enough. Now, all the power in his kidney was used to lock the force. It seemed that it did not have any other functions.
         And teacher, the last time he forcefully used the water Tiger, perhaps ... It was the same.
          However, his teacher was old, so it didn't matter.
         Boss is at the prime of his life.
         Liu Long was completely speechless and couldn't be bothered to pay attention to him. This guy really spoiled his mood at such a happy time.
         He looked at the sky and saw that it was pitch black.
         He said,"it's the 24th, right? it's almost the 25th. We're still very far from the transverse Canyon. I've wasted a lot of time. Can we make it in time?"
         From the Silver City to the other side of the transverse Canyon, they had to cross at least 3000 li. Li Hao's group had only traveled a thousand li, and they still had half of the journey left.
         Even though the road was easier to walk on, it would still take a lot of time to rush from the transverse Canyon to the ruins.
         At this moment, he could leave the Cang mountains and head directly to the crosscut Canyon, which would be faster.
         If they went out from here, they would probably reach another city in yinbei.
         It was easy to hide one's tracks in the Cang mountains, but it was too difficult to travel.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"if we go from here to the other end, we can hide as much as possible." If we go down the mountain from here, we might encounter some people and cause some accidents ..."
         It wasn't that they had to go that way, but that way, it would be easier to hide and avoid trouble. Once they reached the ruins, hou Xiaochen and the others would be there, and there wouldn't be any more large-scale battles.
         However, a group of experts from the three major organizations had died. They might not have enough power to stop them.
         Li Hao guessed that there was a 99% chance that the remains would open this month.
         With hou Xiaochen's personality and the large organizations, there was no way he wouldn't open it. He was more than happy to open it so that these people would be sent to their deaths.
         Therefore, after thinking for a while, in order to make it in time for the opening of the relic, Li Hao said,""Then let's go down the mountain from here and hide our tracks. If we can hide, we'll hide. Otherwise, we might not make it in time."
         He still chose to go to the ruins first.
         As for why Banshan and the others didn't appear after they came out and were discovered ... What does that have to do with me?
         Li Hao thought for a while and stopped thinking about it.
         The group of people quickly began to walk through the mountain forest, preparing to go down the mountain.
         Above their heads, the huge Goshawk escorted or monitored them all the way until they passed through the forest and walked out of the Cang Mountain range.
         At dawn, Li Hao's group had entered a small city.
         It was also one of the 16 cities in the North of silver. However, at this moment, Li Hao and the others had all taken off their black armors and loaded them into a big cart. Li Hao and his group had also transformed into a martial arts school escort team that was walking in the North of silver.
         With the rise of superpowers, transportation was no longer easy. Nowadays, some martial artists and weak superpowers would choose to become escorts to help large companies transport supplies.
         At this moment, Li Hao's group disguised themselves and escorted a carriage of black carriages toward the transverse Canyon.  ……
         At the same time.
         In the valley of the broken mountain.
         When Hong Yitang and Nan Quan saw the goshawk flying back, they also left without looking back.
         The four great demonic beasts watched the two of them leave.
         They had said that they would leave in a day, but these two had stayed in this area for several days.
         As a result, they did not dare to separate rashly, in case they were attacked one by one.
         After they left, the Golden Eagle's psyche fluctuated and said,""Let's go!"
         "The devil's successor has also left."
         "It seems that these Silver Moon martial masters are all related."
         “……”
         The few great demons conversed for a while. The two of them waited until Li Hao left before they chose to leave. This made them realize that the martial masters of Silver Moon were sometimes very United.
         Of course, it was also because Li Hao had helped them suppress the changes.
         The ferocious Tiger's mind was also stirred."Silver moon's territory ... It's best if we don't rashly set foot in it. The situation is very complicated. There might not be just these few guys; there might be even stronger existences!"
         The Golden Condor replied via voice transmission,'there's definitely one, and ... It's also possible that it's a demon expert! I've once flown past the Cang mountains and stepped into the land of the Silver Moon. In the end, I didn't fly far before I felt a sense of suffocation! It's not just one, it's everywhere. I suspect that there are many top-tier experts in the Silver Moon land, and there are also powerful demons ... I think I saw a turtle ..."
         As soon as he said this, the great demons 'expressions became extremely grave.
         The Cang mountains and the Silver Moon were too close. It was no wonder that some powerful existences in the Cang mountains were never willing to head to the Silver moon in the south. Most of them would head to the Li Dynasty in the North.
         "The Skygold Lotus is maturing this time, and the next time it ripens will be in another five years ... Are we just going to wait here? Or ... Should we go to the North ... To the Li Dynasty to take a look?"
         This was the Tiger's thought. It didn't want to stay here anymore.
         Originally, he didn't feel too much pressure, but now, he was under a lot of pressure.
         The Golden Eagle's psyche fluctuated."The North isn't safe either. It's even more dangerous. There are many powerful cultivators in Dali ... I've seen one of them tear apart a Jade moon rhinoceros that was as powerful as me."
         The giant ape also spoke at this moment, and a violent spiritual fluctuation was emitted from its mind."What are you afraid of? There were many experts in the Li Dynasty, but they were all very direct. The people known as the barbarians were more direct. Whether they were strong or weak, it was obvious at a glance that they were stronger than Silver Moon! They all look weak, but in reality, they are extremely powerful ..."
         It was just short of saying that Silver Moon was a sinister villain!
         In fact, that was what he meant.
          The Golden Eagle thought for a while and nodded its huge head.""Then let's go to the North ... We need more resources, more treasures, and more powerful people ... The Silver Moon is full of secrets, and I can feel it. Some of them are awakening ... We'll come back after we take this step!"
         The three of them were all in the process of transformation. Although the great snake was a little weaker, it was almost there.
         At that time, if all of them could advance, they would be above the rising sun at Silver moon's side. With four above the rising sun, they would not be suppressed and beaten up if they went to Silver Moon, right?
         After making their decision, the four great demons were decisive. They would leave the broken Mountain Valley to the three yang lesser demons. After all, there were still five years before the heavenly Golden Lotus ripened.
         The few great demons were extremely decisive. They quickly left and headed north.
         "I just want one petal. Three golden lotuses. You guys can split them!" The Python couldn't help but say.
         As it took the initiative to speak ... A moment later, it was given the Golden Lotus petal that it had been dreaming of. As for the Lotus seed, it naturally didn't get a share.
         This made the snake very desperate. The gap between him and the rest of them would only get bigger!
         As for the other three great demons, their eyes were all smiling. It was fine as long as they were tactful. Otherwise, it would be difficult for everyone to share.
         On this day, Li Hao went south while the four demons went north. They entered the Li Dynasty, which no one in the star dynasty had mentioned for a long time.
        
         Hengduan Canyon.
         As the time for the next opening of the ruins drew closer, there were already some buildings here. Some of the supers no longer slept in the wilderness and chose to build houses on the spot.
         Not only that, a group of merchants even appeared.
         They were selling mysterious energy and even divine energy stones!
         Of course, not only that, there were also people who sold ancient weapons, antiques, ancient books, and secret martial arts techniques that were hard to distinguish between real and fake.
         Heaven battling city, in such a short time, had actually given birth to a deformed market in this Canyon.
         The reason why it was abnormal was that only the strong had the right to set up a stall here to sell goods or had the protection of a powerful force. Otherwise, if one sold things here, they would have the life to sell but not the life to spend.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The three major organizations had also openly established their own strongholds here.
         They each took their own place and waited to enter the ruins.
         At this moment, a figure flew into the sky and attracted the attention of the supers in the canyon.
          "Everyone, I am Hao lianchuan, the deputy head of the Silver Moon Nightwalker!"
         "According to the agreement between the parties, apart from the three major dark energy organizations, the heaven battling city ruins will open on the 28th of this month. After it opens, it will remain open for half an hour. Anyone who wants to enter will have to pay 10 cubic meters of mysterious energy from Starlight and ten decapitation realms, 30 cubic meters from breaking hundred and dark Moon, and 100 cubic meters from Sunblaze and thousand fighting! One divine power Stone for the three suns, ten for the rising sun ... This will be the fee for Silver Moon to maintain the opening of the ruins!"
         As soon as these words came out, there was an uproar.
         It was fine for the weak, but even if it was 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy, it was not too expensive.
         However, the divine power Stone!
         The Tri-sun realm required divine energy stones to enter. It was too expensive!
         At this moment, a three-Sun Expert in the canyon said,""Minister kui, isn't it too much to ask for a divine power Stone for the three suns? As far as I know, heaven battling city is divided into an inner and outer city. There are almost no treasures in the outer city, only the inner city, and the inner city is extremely dangerous ... You have to risk your life to explore it ..."
         Hao lianchuan looked down at the man and said calmly,""Then we won't go in! It's so dangerous, why go in?"
         That person's expression was somewhat unsightly, but thinking that this was the other party's territory after all, he suppressed his anger and said again,""Does that mean that the three great organizations and silver moon's officials are all free?"
         "Of course, the three Darksider organizations will have to pay some other price. You don't have to worry about that!"
         "Minister Xi, what about the other province's night watchers or official organizations ..."
         "Pay up!"
         Hao lianchuan did not stand on ceremony and said loudly,""It's fine if you don't want to pay, but you'll have to join my Silver Moon Nightwalker first. The situation in the other provinces is still unclear, but you can join my Nightwalker first to do a qualification check in case any criminals impersonate you. Once you pass ... You'll naturally be free!"
         Nonsense!
         Everyone was speechless.
         What qualification examination? if you really join the Silver Moon Nightwalker, you'll be in big trouble. As a Nightwalker, how dare you disobey your superior's orders?
         If I want you to be cannon fodder, you will be cannon fodder.
         The three suns were extremely depressed and said loudly,""What if we don't have the divine energy stone?"  " 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy is fine too!"
         It wasn't cheap either, and the value wasn't much different.
         If he asked again what he could do without mystery ... Then he would not go in.
         What else could he say?
         Below, the originally noisy crowd quieted down.
         After a while, a young man smiled and said,""Is there a limit to the number of people who can enter?"
         "There are no restrictions!"
         "Other than that, the remains will not be opened until three days later!" Hao lianchuan said loudly.
         In the past, it would be opened at 12 o' clock every night.
         This was also the key to why many people had escaped last time.
         The moment he said that, there was a commotion. Some superpowers frowned and some were even dissatisfied."Then we only want to explore for a day or two. Doesn't that mean we have to wait until the last moment to come out?"
         It would be much safer to get out early after getting something good.
         If they all came out together ... Would it be a good thing for the unaffiliated cultivators who had obtained the treasures to come out together with the other experts?
         He wouldn't even know how he died!
         "This is for everyone's safety!" Hao lianchuan said in a deep voice. Otherwise, if an expert were to barge in or sneak in halfway through the opening, it would bring greater danger to everyone! In order to prevent this from happening, we will seal off this place in advance after everyone enters. The Wei Wu Army, the night patrollers, and the garrison will be stationed here, and the city-destroying bomb will lock onto the area. Only at the last moment when everyone has come out will the seal be opened!"
         "If you think it's too dangerous, just give up. You can't ignore the safety of others for the sake of an individual!"
         "Also, Silver Moon won't be responsible for any risks or dangers that may arise after we enter the remains!" Hao lianchuan added. The ruins are dangerous, so be careful when you enter!"
          This did not matter to them. No one was counting on Silver moon's side to still be responsible for their safety after they entered.
         That's impossible!
         It was very quiet below, and the three great organizations were silent as well. It was obvious that the two sides had made an agreement.
         As for what they had to pay, that was unknown.
         ……
         In a military camp above the transverse Canyon.
         This place was now sealed off and taken over by the garrison. The garrison was also responsible for the safety of the periphery of this relic exploration. It was said that there were even city-destroying bombs prepared here, which could be launched at the cross-section Canyon at any time.
         At the center of the camp.
         It was no longer as simple and crude as last time. Instead, houses were built and reinforced with earth, and there were even plants planted with wood.
         It was no longer barren, and there was even some green.
        
         At this moment, several important figures were gathered in the big house in the middle.
         They were hou Xiaochen, Huang Yu, Hu dingfang, Ren tianchuan, director Zhao, Deputy Director Zhou, Kong Jie, Hu Qingfeng ...
         A group of powerful and influential figures were all here.
         Ren tianchuan, the commander of the White Dragon Army.
         At this moment, it was this person who was speaking. A map appeared in front of him, a very dark map. He said to the crowd,""This is The Map of Heaven battling city's inner city, but it's not very detailed. It's only a plan made according to the people who entered last time."
         "Our military has Divided Heaven battling city into five regions!"
         "The direction we entered from is the East Side of Heaven battling city's inner gate!"
         "The East. When you enter the outer city, the first thing you see is the East. This is a residential area. There are some businesses, but they are not mainly commercial. "Next up is the North. According to the last Exploration, the North might have been a military area back then. It's said that some people even saw airplanes ... They haven't explored it yet."
         "The South. This should be a real commercial area. Some people have seen many shops."
         "The West is the industrial area!"
          He separated the people and continued,""The residential area, the military area, the commercial area, the industrial area ... The central tower is the landmark, and it's the true core area of heaven battling city. There's the city Lord's mansion, various offices, and even a large number of ancient books in the secret book area."
         "And in the entire heaven battling city, only one golden-armored warrior has appeared ..."
         In the crowd, Hu Qingfeng quietly listened, remembered, and observed.
         As expected, he had obtained a lot of secret information by joining the high-end meeting as a Night Watcher.
         In fact, everyone in heaven battling city's inner city was in the dark.
         As for Silver Moon, he still had some information to gather. Just the division of these five regions was worth celebrating.
         In terms of wealth, the commercial district had the most, but the Military District might have a large number of divine power stones as reserves. As for the industrial area, it was hard to say at the moment. What kind of industrial system was developed in the ancient civilization?
         If it was a military system ... That would be incredible!
         At this time, a young man in the crowd suddenly said,""Just how strong is this gold-tier powerhouse? did Silver Moon analyze it?"
         Everyone turned to look at the man.
         Hu Qingfeng was no exception. He took a look and cursed in his heart,"pretentious B * stard, you talk too much!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This young man looked like he was in his twenties. He was handsome and very sunny.
         Hu Qingfeng knew this person.
          It wasn't a part of the night watchman system, but someone from the Division of Administration. The Division of Administration was the direct superior to the administration Bureau. In name, it was the leader of the nine divisions.  The young man in front of him was from the Division of Administration and had come from Tian Xing city.
         This time, the people from Sky Star City also had the intention to participate. Everyone else had remained silent, but this fellow had openly entered the Silver Moon administration and participated in this exploration under the official name.
         Hu Qingfeng knew this person, and he was quite famous. He was Qi gang from the Division of Administration.
         Just like the few heaven-blessed divine Masters from the inspection Office, this man was also a heaven-blessed Divine Master, and he was very powerful. He was in the middle stage of the rising light realm, which was slightly more powerful than Hu Qingfeng, and his strength was on par with the geniuses of the night patrollers.
         These people were all on the God tier Masters Ranking.
         There were 99 Masters on the God tier masters list, including the nine divisions, the royal family, the three major organizations, the seven divine mountains, and the wealthy families of the four Seas.
         In the field of superpowers, the three major organizations were extremely powerful.
         The superpowers of the seven sacred mountains were not very strong, but they were all guarded by peerless powerhouses. For example, sky sword from Silvermoon was the owner of one of the sacred mountains, and there were people from his sect who had come out of the mountains.
         The other divine mountains either had the powers of the top martial masters or great demons.
         Yes, there were even big demons on the God tier masters list.
         However, it was not easy to distinguish the age of the great demons. Many great demons who had risen in recent years had been stuffed in regardless of their age.
         It mainly depended on the age of the demon's awakening. If the demon was less than ten years old, it would not matter how old it was before awakening. In fact, it was not that old before awakening. In the past, before the rise of superpowers, the demon would not have lived for more than a few years.
          The Masters from these forces divided the God tier Masters Ranking. There were also some independent Masters who traveled alone. They were god tier Masters who were born with super powers and were extremely powerful.
         Compared to these people, Hu Qingfeng was nothing.
         Hu Qingfeng's mind was filled with wild thoughts. He thought of LAN Yue, who was also on the God tier master list. He was the only one on the list of July of the Crimson Moon. The others were either too old or too weak like Ziyue.
         One of the Yama's ten Palace Masters was also among them.
         There were also elders in the Feitian Elder Council.
         Among the night watchers, a few geniuses were on the list. Qi gang was one of the three geniuses from the administrative division. He was very young, only 26 years old, but his powers had been activated for nine years. In just nine years, he had entered the mid-stage of the rising light. He was extremely terrifying!
         ? He was also an expert in the metal element. It was said that he had a body full of metal-element powers and was extremely powerful.
         The God tier master roll hadn't been widely publicized yet, so Hu Qingfeng knew that these Silver Moon country bumpkins might not know about this person's situation.
         If they knew, they might not welcome him.
         Just as he was thinking about this, hou Xiaochen smiled and said,"Envoy Qi, it's not easy to judge the specific strength. From the current situation, this gold-tier warrior's strength is probably between the peak of the rising light and the transformation of the rising light."
