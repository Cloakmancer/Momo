The floating light in the West was quite a distance away from the Dragon field in the South.When he was at Level 1, Li Hao would have needed at least a few days to get there. Now, he only needed a day to reach the perfection of Level 3.Of course, to a third stage venerable sovereign, it still needed one day. From this, one could see how big the heaven was.Tianfang's population wasn't considered too big.Most of the places were empty.The energy was extremely rich, but there were no natives here in the strict sense. Almost all of them were foreigners.……A day later.Li Hao arrived in the South and entered the return Dragon field.The boundaries between worlds were all set up by small barriers.It wasn't too strong, and venerable sovereigns could pass through it easily.This time, Li Hao had slightly altered his appearance. He no longer had his previous appearance, but looked more resolute and rough. His style of clothing was also completely different from Silver Moon 's.The number of venerable sovereigns who had returned to the Dragon field might be the most among the other fields.This time, the return Dragon Emperor had brought a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns with him, but he had left behind quite a number of initial-stage venerable sovereigns, which was more than what he had left at the floating light region.Li Hao had just entered the return Dragon field.A first level venerable sovereign floated over."May I ask which fellow Daoist has returned to the Dragon field?"The venerable sovereign floated down.The venerable sovereigns of the Dragon field were similar to the venerable sovereigns of the Dragon return sect. No matter if they knew each other or not, they would never hit a smiling person. They were generally relatively polite."White light of the world of desolation!"Li Hao's face was cold."I came to Tian Fang to find opportunities. Please forgive me for disturbing you!"The frigid world?The venerable sovereign was somewhat confused, but he did not care too much. There were simply too many Middle Worlds in the primal Chaos. Great worlds were still alright and were more or less famous, but some small and medium-sized worlds had little contact with the outside world. There were also very few venerable sovereigns, and they were almost unknown.He had never heard of the frigid world. It was not a major world, nor was it a well-known medium-level world.In that case, there was nothing to be afraid of when he returned to the Dragon field. The forces of the rank six venerable sovereigns did not need to be afraid of these unknown worlds.Of course, the other party's aura was not weak.He was probably a third level venerable sovereign, which was the peak of the beginner level. This venerable sovereign was rather polite."Then you've come to the right place. There are many places with Taoist connotation in the Dragon field. They are all left behind by high-level venerable sovereigns. There are the famous Coiling Dragon Well, Fire Mountain, Dark Demon Ridge ... All of them were left behind by the top experts of Tian Fang in the past.""Except for the dark Demon Ridge, you can enter the other Taoist connotation for free and comprehend at will ..."The venerable sovereign gave a brief introduction and said,""Recently, the temple master has gone out for some business. Only venerable Emperor Kong Ji, who is a rank five, is in charge of the Hui long temple! He's a man of few words and rarely shows his face ... It's not very convenient for him to receive you, fellow Daoist. "A third level venerable sovereign was a pretty good position. Under normal circumstances, it would be better to rope in venerable sovereigns from unknown worlds.It was normal to rope in a rank three venerable sovereign.However ... This time, only one middle-stage venerable sovereign remained in the temple, and this person was not in charge.He had heard that a friend of the temple master would come in a few days to help with the management of the Huilong temple. But he had not come yet."It's fine!"Li Hao smiled."I took the liberty to visit. I entered the floating light region to look for opportunities with a few fellow Daoists. However, the floating light region doesn't have a suitable place for my Taoist connotation, so I took the liberty to come to the Dragon field. It's said that the Dragon field is the strongest of the four tianfang regions ..."How many other fellow Daoists are there?The venerable sovereign of the Hui long temple was moved. That was not simple. There was a difference between one venerable sovereign and several venerable sovereigns."Fellow Daoist's companions ... Are still in the floating light region?""There are two other fellow Daoists on this trip, and they're both at the 2nd stage ..." Li Hao nodded.This was not weak!One rank three and two rank two!"If you don't mind, a middle-stage venerable sovereign will return to my temple in a few days. You can come to my temple to discuss the Dao then ..." The venerable sovereign said.The return of a middle-stage venerable sovereign?Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He smiled and nodded."If there's nothing else, I won't bother you and will naturally go! Listening to a senior's advice was also an opportunity! In addition, I have a favor to ask of you. I wonder if you can help me with it?""Daoist baiguang, please speak!""I'm new here and I'm not familiar with the Dragon field. Can you arrange a guide to show me the way ...""This is simple!""If you don't mind, I'll lead the way," the Daoist quickly said.Li Hao shook his head."Fellow Daoist, as a venerable Emperor, you have many things to do in Huilong temple. Since venerable Emperor Huilong is not here, you all have important responsibilities. How can you disturb us?" We'll just arrange for a Dao integration cultivator to be there ...""The daomerge?"The man was stunned. Li Hao explained,"that's the name of the realms in the world of grayfrost ... I'm confused. It's only below venerable sovereign ... I don't really care about what's below venerable sovereign in tianfang ..."​ The daomerge was Silver moon's specialty.Silver Moon did not go out either. Li Hao was not worried that anyone would find it strange, because there were too many worlds and too many names of realms. Who would care about the names of those below venerable sovereign?"This is simple!""I still have a small request," Li Hao said."I don't want to trouble you again." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"my friends might come in a few days. One of them is not a human but a Chaos Beast. It would be best if you could arrange for a demon to be my guide."The other party nodded. This was also simple. The Huilong temple did not lack such people.

Chapter 2761 What A Coincidence (3)
There was no lack of such demons.A third level venerable sovereign was not a weakling. It was an opportunity for him to be snatched by others."My friend is from the dog Race and doesn't like the competition between land demons. If there are flying demons or water demons, it would be most suitable! It's best ... To be good at defense. "The venerable sovereigns on the other side were stunned. Why?Li Hao was a little embarrassed. He said in a low voice,""Fellow Daoist, please don't laugh at me. My fellow Daoist from the Chaos Beast race is a little irascible. He would ... Would ... Would often spar with me. Of course, I'll compensate Huilong temple. If the guide dies, I'll compensate his family with 100 Dao crystals ..."100 great Dao crystals!It wasn't too much, but it wasn't too little either. For those below venerable sovereign, it was still okay.But ... The venerable sovereign understood.His friend, the Chaos Beast Thearch, might like to eat and not spar. Chaos beasts had always been like this.This was the real 'meat bun hitting the dog'!Under normal circumstances, the Huilong temple didn't like to agree to this kind of thing, but it wasn't a big deal. It was actually worth it to make friends with a few venerable sovereigns after the death of a few.Anyone below venerable sovereign had no human rights.If he died, then he died!However, in this case, the guide could not be randomly selected. Some people were still taken care of by some venerable sovereigns.He wanted demons of the water element and flying element ... Was he being picky?He had to be ignored, have strong defense, taste good, and have decent strength ...After thinking for a while, a person came to the venerable sovereign's mind.Giant pincers!It was not good to send the other Heavenly Kings, but this one ... He had served venerable Emperor Hao Yue before. After venerable Emperor Hao Yue left, he could not be touched easily.However, Ming Hao and his group had all died, so some people guessed that Hao Yue was the Silver Moon King.The pincers were also affected.The venerable Emperor of the Hui long sect had even personally summoned this person, but he did not manage to get anything out of him. The venerable Emperor of the Hui long sect also did not directly deal with the giant pincers. At least, Kong Ji was still here. Although he might not care, Kong Ji and Hao Yue were good friends.However, if he was accidentally killed by other venerable sovereigns, he would be able to get rid of an eyesore for the Supreme Emperor of the returning dragon clan. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  As a cultivator of the Dragon returning temple, the giant pincer's task was to receive them.You can't just not do anything, right?Serving a level three venerable sovereign was an opportunity. As long as he didn't say anything, the other party might eat him. Even if he was alone, he wouldn't say anything.If he died, then he should just die.Many thoughts appeared in his mind. At this moment, there were no good candidates. The giant pincer was free, so it was a good choice!"It's just a small matter!"The venerable sovereign laughed."Daoist baiguang, you're too polite. Please wait for a moment. I'll send someone over. As for compensation, you don't have to!" Huilong temple has always made friends with people from all over the chaotic world. It's a small matter!" He was only a first-stage venerable sovereign. Although he was a member of the Huilong temple, he had his own network, which was what they all did. What does the death of a venerable sovereign have to do with me?It was a good deal to exchange the good feelings of the venerable sovereigns with the cultivators who were abandoned by Huilong temple."Thank you, fellow Daoist. May I ask how I should address you?""Return to the Dragon Temple, Yu Chen!""Thank you, fellow Daoist Yu Chen!" Li Hao smiled brightly.As for whether it was a giant pincer, it was not clear, but there was a high probability.It was probably hard to hide the fact that Ming Hao had been killed by him. It was normal for a small figure like giant pincer to be sent out to be abandoned.It wasn't easy to kill the people from Huilong temple, otherwise, it would make people uncomfortable.But if an outsider killed him ... Then he would die. People died every day in tianfang world. It didn't matter if he was below the venerable sovereign level.……Back to the Dragon Temple.Since Li Hao's departure, the giant pincers had been Living a Good Life. After all, he was venerable Emperor void's good friend, and since he was serving Li Hao, he was basically Li Hao's man.He could even be related to a fifth stage venerable sovereign.But soon, the pincers 'days were no longer easy.The giant pincer didn't know Li Hao's true identity, but it knew that he wasn't simple. In fact, it could vaguely guess that Li Hao wasn't telling it, but it didn't hide anything from Kong Ji when they talked.If Kong Ji knew, the giant pincers would naturally be able to tell.However, the giant pincer didn't expect that the Silver Moon King would be able to kill all the venerable sovereigns.He was already shocked when Li Hao killed Supreme Emperor Tian He.However, this time, it had even attracted the attention of Red Moon master, which was earth-shattering!However, he was also unlucky.When the Dragon Emperor summoned him and asked him some questions, he told him some simple things. In fact, he didn't know much about it. However, he knew that Kong Ji had known Li Hao's identity since he had talked to him. He didn't dare to mention that.Huilong didn't get anything out of him. Although he didn't pursue the matter, he was obviously very dissatisfied with him.If it wasn't for the fact that the Huilong temple was a force that needed to recruit people and that he didn't want to fall out with Kong Ji, Kong Ji wouldn't care about a Pincher. In the end, the Huilong Emperor would have chosen to ignore this person!However, the life of the giant pincer began to be difficult!Many people in the temple could tell that they had been ostracizing him these days. If it wasn't for Kong Ji, he wouldn't have lived to this day.Recently, the giant pincer had been considering its future. It was considering ... Whether it should leave the Dragon Temple.While the emptiness was still there, there might still be a chance to leave now.

Chapter 2762 What A Coincidence (3)
When Kong Ji left, he might not have the chance to leave again.At this moment, the giant pincer was thinking about something in his small room. Suddenly, his communication Jade flashed, and he had a bad feeling. He opened it and frowned.To be a guide for a third stage venerable sovereign!Moreover, it was a personal message from venerable Emperor Yu Chen.Under normal circumstances, this was a good thing. However, how many people were waiting in line for such a good thing? would he have a chance to do it now?In the past, it was possible.The giant pincer was a little uneasy.However, as a member of the Huilong temple, he couldn't refuse before he betrayed the temple.He sighed inwardly. Even though he knew that it might not be a good thing, he still chose to accept the mission. He did not look for venerable Emperor Kong Ji. He was not familiar with him, and he seemed to have entered the dark Demon Ridge recently. He could find him if he wanted to ... However, he was not even a venerable Emperor, and the other party was the Son of God of light. Why would he want to annoy him?Very quickly, the giant pincer walked out.There were also other powerhouses around, all waiting for their missions.At this moment, he saw the giant pincer walk out and walk out.Some people took a look and were surprised.Someone received the news and transmitted a message,""Giant pincer seems to be going to receive a rank three venerable sovereign!""Really? This guy seems to be related to that person ... Why would he be given this opportunity?""It might not be a good thing! I think it was an order from sovereign Yu Chen. "Everyone's heart moved, but that might not be a good thing.Supreme Emperor Yu Chen was a follower of Supreme Emperor Hui long ... Anyway, he was good at reading people's minds. Since Supreme Emperor Hui long did not like the giant pincers, would Yu Chen give them a chance?It seemed to be a dangerous job.This kind of thing seemed to be quite common.Some people revealed a gloating smile. The giant pincer's recent progress wasn't slow, and it even showed signs of stepping into the half-step sovereign realm. Once it became a half-step sovereign, it would be a reserve sovereign venerable, and its status in the Huilong temple wouldn't be low. When one became a venerable sovereign, they would be the master.They all had the same job and the same strength, but the giant pincer was one step ahead. Everyone was jealous, so who would be happy to see him advance from a servant to a master?Before this, everyone could only be envious, but now ... Someone laughed maliciously.This time, this guy might be finished.Venerable sovereigns 'personalities were ever-changing. It was normal for some venerable sovereigns to eat humans and demons, while others were fickle and killed people at will. Under normal circumstances, as long as it did not involve venerable sovereigns, the Huilong temple would not say anything.Obviously, the giant pincer might encounter such a venerable sovereign this time.Someone watched the giant pincers leave and laughed loudly."Giant pincer, looks like you've taken on a good mission again. Don't forget your brothers after you become a venerable sovereign!""What good luck!"Some people also laughed, but their laughter was filled with malice. In front of him, the giant pincers did not say a word as they crossed the sky.For a power like the Dragon returning temple, the people at the bottom were not United. In fact, it was the same for the people at the top. They were all cultivators from all over the world. They were not from the same world, the same race, and the same civilization.In the chaos, a world was a collective. It was difficult for things that were not of the same world to merge together.They were both doing it for their own benefits.He had been glorious in the past, but now he was in dire straits. It was normal for these people to be jealous and envious of him, wishing that he would die early. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In the past, he would have been furious.But today ... He was not as angry as he had imagined.He was different from these people.He had once served Li Hao and listened to Li Hao and venerable Emperor void's Dao discussion. One was the famous Silver Moon King, while the other was a rank five venerable Emperor who had re-cultivated the great Dao after rank eight ...These people would never have such an experience in their entire lives.Even if there were experts discussing the Dao, these people would not have the right to listen. However, he had listened to the Dao of two top Dao Masters alone.The giant pincers suddenly had a feeling of superiority.The heavens I've seen are not what you can see. Even though I've died this time, my vision and my world are still higher than yours.It was just a pity that ... In the end, he was not able to enter the venerable sovereign realm.It was a pity that he had missed the chance that venerable Emperor Hao Yue had given him.It was a little regretful!……After a while.The giant pincers had arrived.At a glance, he saw Li Hao, who was standing beside Yu Chen. He was very boorish, completely different from Li Hao. However, the giant pincer was a little confused. This venerable sovereign ... Although boorish, he seemed somewhat familiar at first glance.He didn't dare to say or look. He quickly landed on the ground and respectfully greeted,""I'm the giant pincers of the returning Dragon. Greetings to venerable sovereign Yu Chen and the seniors!"Yu Chen smiled and looked at Li Hao."Fellow Daoist baiguang, let giant pincer accompany you on a tour. Giant pincer is not bad. He's about to enter the half-Emperor realm!" In my Dragon return temple, he's ... He's also a top-notch Dao integration stage super mighty figure!""Giant pincer has been a guide for many venerable sovereigns," he continued."He didn't just return to the Dragon field. He knows a little about other fields. If you want to return to the floating light field, you can bring him there too."He smiled brightly and looked at the giant pincers with a dignified expression,""Entertain Thearch white light well! Venerable sovereign white light is a third rank venerable sovereign, and he has several good friends who are all venerable sovereigns. They're all searching for the Dao in tianfang, so there can't be any mistakes, or else ... You'll be punished!""I don't dare!"The giant Pincher had a solemn expression as it sighed in its heart.He's dead!Emperor Yu Chen must have wanted to kill him to please the Dragon Emperor.At the same time, he felt that this venerable sovereign Yu Chen was too boring. Why did he have to go through so much trouble to kill a non-venerable sovereign like him?

Chapter 2763 What A Coincidence (3)_4
On the side, Li Hao smiled."Daoist Yu Chen, you can go and do your work. I won't waste your time. This ... Little friend can come with me!""Then, Daoist baiguang, please feel free to do as you please. If you need anything, call me at any time!"Yu Chen smiled and did not stand on ceremony. He knew that this person probably did not want a venerable sovereign to accompany him and still had some hope for the Taoist connotation ... This was what every venerable sovereign who came here looked forward to.He also understood the other party's thoughts, so he beckoned to them and quickly left.After the other party left, the giant pincer said calmly,""Senior white light, where do you want to go?"Li Hao smiled and glanced at the giant pincers.From the looks of it ... He had really become cannon fodder. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Although he had tried his best to avoid interacting with people from Tian Fang, he had still implicated one person. Of course, Kong Ji was one of them. He was not afraid of trouble. As long as trouble was interesting, he would be happy to find some fun in his lonely life."How about going to the Coiling Dragon Well?""Is there a Taoist connotation over there?" Li Hao asked with a faint smile."Very few ..." "The Taoist connotation has disappeared in the Coiling Dragon Well," the giant pincer said seriously."It's hard to find any Taoist connotation now."Li Hao laughed,"really?" However, I heard that some time ago, someone had gained enlightenment of the Taoist connotation there. ""That's a coincidence," the giant pincer said after some thought."It's actually very difficult.""Coincidence? I heard that it was caused by the Silver Moon King. Is that true?"The giant pincer was shocked, but it pretended to be confused."This ... I'm not too sure. Where did senior hear this from? Silvermoon King, have you ever been to my Skyland world?""Yes, I have. Weren't you the guide?"The giant pincer was shocked!Who was this person?How did he know?Li Hao smiled."Giant pincer, I haven't seen you in a few days. Why are you so quiet?"“……”The giant pincer was shocked. It looked at Li Hao in disbelief. It was impossible!Wasn't that person still in the depths of chaos?It was said that he was in contact with new martial. He even heard that the reason why the venerable Dragon Emperor and the others went to the chaos this time was to deal with new martial, and the Silver Moon King was also among them.Everyone felt that this person was currently considering neo martial!It couldn't be him!While he was thinking, Li Hao smiled."Alright, it's boring to think too much. Did anything happen after I left?" Did anything else happen after Minghao and the others died?"“……”The giant Pincher trembled and only spoke with difficulty after a long time,""What do you mean, senior?""Alright, we've talked a lot on Mount Huoxing, Coiling Dragon Well, and when we were killing Tianhe. Let's not talk about this anymore."While walking, Li Hao said,""Where is Kong Ji now?""Senior ...""Have you forgotten what I said? you can look for me when you're about to become a saint Emperor." The giant pincer was instantly shocked by his words."My Lord!"The giant pincer was surprised, happy, and scared. How could it be?"Your Excellency ... You ... You're back?""Surprised?" Li Hao laughed.The giant pincer said in disbelief,"it's a surprise, it's too surprising!" Everyone says that you've killed all the venerable sovereigns and are now fleeing in the direction of new martial arts to meet up with them. Why is Your Excellency here?""I came back to take a look."The giant pincer was shocked, but it did not ask any more questions. It hurriedly said,""After you killed those people, the red moon sent news that they want to kill you. There will be many rewards. It is said that the venerable sovereign Hui long and the others have recruited many experts. Four sixth stage experts and dozens of middle stage venerable sovereigns have gone to the depths of the chaos to kill the neo martial artist. It has only been ten days since they left!""So many people?""Yes,""Venerable Emperor void is still in the Dragon Temple, but ... He seems to have gone to the dark Demon Ridge. He hasn't appeared recently. Also, a middle-stage venerable Emperor might be coming to the Dragon Temple soon. It's said that ... He might be from the cloud world!"The giant pincer was a member of the Dragon Temple, so he knew a lot of information. He said hurriedly,""The venerable Dragon Emperor and senior Kong Ji might not be on good terms. That's why he's worried about leaving the Dragon Temple to senior Kong Ji.""How many venerable sovereigns are there in the Dragon Temple?" Li Hao nodded."Not including senior Kong Ji, there are 16 more, and they are all low level venerable sovereigns! There were originally 12, but after the two nearby regions joined, there were 16. The two nearby region Lords left with Hui long Emperor. "16th place!Li Hao knew that Huilong didn't take any low-rank venerable sovereigns with him.Of course, the few from The Dark World had all been killed. Otherwise, there would have been even more.Back to the Dragon Temple!The Dragon Emperor was a great enemy.'This bastard. The last two times he isolated the dark Demon Ridge, it was to deal with me.'Now, he had even brought people to hunt for neo martial artists ... This was a true enemy.The Dragon returning temple should be backed by the cloud world.The great cloud world seemed to be targeting neo martial.16 venerable sovereigns ... That was not a small number.As for Kong Ji, since he had disappeared, he might have gone to the Dao chess game to comprehend the great Dao.This thought appeared in his mind, it was better to be quick than late.Thinking of this, Li Hao asked, when will Yunxiao's venerable sovereign arrive?"It's in the next few days!""Are all the venerable sovereigns who returned to the Dragon Temple here?" Li Hao nodded."A few of them are not here. I don't know the details. After all, they are all venerable sovereigns. I can't track all of them."Li Hao nodded again.After thinking for a while, he smiled."I want to kill them all this time. Do you think it's too cruel to kill all the venerable sovereigns in the Huilong temple?"

Chapter 2764 What A Coincidence (3)_5
The giant pincer was shocked!How ruthless!Of course, this seemed to be his style. He looked kind, but in fact, he was extremely ruthless.How many venerable sovereigns had he killed?To be honest, except for the destruction of the great world, the number of venerable sovereigns who died in the other battles was not as many as this one. Even if most of them were weak venerable sovereigns, they were all strong!"Sir, if all 16 of them are here, it'll be extremely dangerous.""I'm fine. "Li Hao smiled."I'm just asking if there are any venerable sovereigns in the Dragon Temple. If they're kind ... It's also a way for me to comfort myself. If you say no, I'll have to be ruthless!"“……”The giant pincer was a little scared, but it still quickly said,""Kind ... This ... It's hard to say. At the venerable sovereign level, it's not something that a lowly person can understand."Li Hao nodded."In that case ... Let's serve our own Masters. There's nothing worth paying special attention to, right?"The giant pincer did not say anything else.Li Hao calculated for a moment and said,"however, these venerable sovereigns may not be together. They may be separated, which will be troublesome. By the way, the venerable sovereign from the cloud world is here. Will these people come back?"The giant pincer nodded,'if I'm in tianfang, I'll be back! The venerable Emperor of the returning dragon clan had given an order before he left. When he was not around, this person was in charge of the returning Dragon Temple and was his best friend ... We all know that he should be from the great world behind the venerable Emperor of the returning dragon clan! Those venerable sovereigns also want to make friends with the venerable sovereigns of the macro worlds, so as long as they are not trapped or can't come back, they will come back. ""That's not bad!"Li Hao smiled. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If all of them came, there would be 17 of them, 16 low-stage venerable sovereigns and one middle-stage venerable sovereign.Of course, there was also Kong Ji, who might not have the time to pay attention to him now.Huilong temple, Dark Demon Ridge.Li Hao pondered for a moment. A level eight venerable sovereign ... Borrowing the power of a level eight venerable sovereign would be asking for his life. It was too dangerous.I can't borrow it!He had his own demands for going back to venerable Emperor Longguan. On one hand, he wanted to gather energy so that he could enter the game ... He didn't need energy to enter the game, but he couldn 'T. He had to get out of the game first, or he would be trapped.On the other hand, to create signs of the recovery of the great Dao universe ... Wouldn't he need more energy?Otherwise, the commotion would not be big enough.Last time, when he borrowed level six power, Tian Fang's own universe of the great path seemed to show signs of recovery. If he borrowed Level Seven or level eight power this time, Tian Fang's own universe of the great path would definitely have some movement.Such a huge commotion was more suitable to deceive everyone.The real and the fake were mixed together.Only by killing all the venerable sovereigns who had returned to the Dragon field could he hide it.Otherwise ... It would be hard to hide it. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation is coming, and it'll be easy for people to guess that I'm here."Therefore, killing the venerable sovereigns and the witnesses will hide my tracks.Otherwise, if he appeared here and the great Dao universe appeared ... People would probably be able to guess that it was related to him.If he didn't kill these venerable sovereigns, he could also fake it ... But the movement of the fake would be too small.Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Besides, it would be best to go back to the Dragon field if it was fake.This place was right at the entrance of the southern realm, and it was convenient for the venerable Dragon Emperor and the others to return."Giant pincer, help me do something!""Milord's orders!" The giant pincers responded hurriedly."In a few days, that Yunxiao venerable sovereign will arrive ... Help me close the southern gate," Li Hao said.The giant pincers were stunned.Looking at Li Hao, he was a little scared.""Close the realm gate?""Right!"Li Hao nodded."The opening of the realm gate will cause too much of a commotion. I'm afraid I'll get into trouble!" In addition, if a chaos lightning tribulation appeared ... The realm gate would be closed, temporarily preventing the lightning tribulation from entering the great world! I was hoping that Kong Ji would take action, but he seems to be in seclusion, so I won't look for him for the time being. If venerable sovereigns are here, can you kill a few of them at the realm gate?"The giant pincer was shocked, but it still quickly said,""There are only a few Heavenly Kings near the realm gate. I'm about to step into the half-step sovereign realm. I can kill them!"Li Hao laughed."They're all your colleagues. You're going to kill them just like that?""We're only gathered together for benefits ..."The giant pincer said hurriedly.Li Hao smiled. He didn't care too much about this.After some thought, he continued,"you've been at the realm gate for a while. You should be familiar with it. Anyway, just help me close the realm gate. It's not too difficult! In addition, I want to create a Taoist connotation in fire element mountain or Coiling Dragon Well to attract all the venerable sovereigns here ... Do you think they will all come?""My Lord, are you going to take action on the day the venerable sovereign of the cloud world arrives?" the giant pincer asked quickly."Yes,""Then ... As long as Yunxiao's venerable sovereign arrives, they'll follow!"He then added,"we still don't know the specific situation of the cloud world's venerable sovereign. If we know his attributes, it'll be easy to choose if it's either the fire element or the path of the physical body. If it's an elemental great Dao, then it'll be at the fire Mountain. If it's not an elemental great Dao, then it'll be best to go to the Coiling Dragon Well. The path of the physical body is suitable for all cultivators."Li Hao nodded. This was a good idea."The cultivators of the cloud world are mainly elemental-type cultivators. Therefore, for now, the fire element mountain is more suitable," the giant pincer added.As he spoke, he hesitated."The cloud world's venerable sovereign is here. I'm afraid it's level six. Senior Kong Ji is level five. The other party should be stronger to prevent senior Kong Ji from causing trouble."

Chapter 2765 What A Coincidence (3)_6
"Sixth-rank is good. Otherwise, I feel like I'm losing out.""Good news!" Li Hao smiled.The fire element mountain was the territory of a seventh rank venerable sovereign.He had seen Daoist flame...And he had felt that he was very powerful.The key was not to kill these venerable sovereigns, but the chaos lightning tribulation would definitely come after they were killed!At that time, it might even be a seventh-grade lightning.If he were to kill them, it would be best for him to leave behind a large amount of energy to defend against the lightning. Otherwise ... He would be in deep trouble. If he were to exhaust all of his energy like before, he wouldn't be able to deal with the lightning of the seventh step with just his third step strength.Before this, it was only Grade 6 lightning."Oh right, there's another thing ...""Milord's orders!""If you need it, help me get the void out!"Li Hao smiled and said,"he should have entered the dark Demon Ridge ... After I kill him, I might undergo a Heavenly Tribulation!" The lightning tribulation is difficult to overcome. If you can, there's no need to disturb him. If it's difficult to overcome, you can enter the dark Demon Ridge and help me call him out. ""Of course," the giant pincer said hurriedly."But ... Can I shout it out?""It's not a big problem. After I've killed all the venerable sovereigns, you can enter the dark Demon Ridge if you need to at the critical moment ... There shouldn't be any danger now, and there shouldn't be any sinister puppets. Just go straight to the divine Hall and call him out."On the other hand, Dao chess was not in seclusion. They were just comprehending the Dao. If there was a big commotion, they would naturally hear it."Just say my name. If Kong Ji can't hear you, shout chess!"Dao chess?The giant pincer did not understand, but it remembered it.He nodded.Li Hao gave some instructions and made his preparations.He had to be quick. Otherwise, it would be troublesome to rush back when the Supreme Dragon Emperor and the others were far away. He had to think for them. He was afraid that if they were far away, he would not be able to receive any news. That would be even more troublesome.Just come!He turned his head and glanced in the direction of the Huilong temple. This time ... I'm going to kill!Also, was the sixth level venerable sovereign who had been tracking him from the great cloud world?Could it be that person who came this time?If that was the case, then things would be interesting. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The reason he thought so was that the cloud world was still very far away from here. If that person was from the cloud world, he would have gone back to Huilong and the others, so there was no need for this person to follow him.It just so happened that the distance wasn't too far, and with Tier 6 power, it would be easy for him to come to the Skyland world.If ... She just happened to finish him off.Last time, when he escaped, who knew how much that guy had seen."Seventh-rank fire elemental power ..."Li Hao thought to himself that it wasn't a big problem to borrow it. They had already had a dispute last time, anyway. There was nothing to be afraid of a second time.However, the borrowed seventh-tier was not the real seventh-tier after all.Hopefully, it would not be too weak and last for a long time. Otherwise, it would be really difficult to transcend the Tribulation.……At this moment, Li Hao decided to go on a killing spree.Meanwhile, in the chaos.A sixth stage venerable sovereign was also rushing toward Tian Fang.Li Hao had guessed right!The person who came was the sixth level venerable sovereign who had escaped last time. He had come out of the clouds and had not returned. He had just been preparing to return a few days ago when he received an order to take over the Hui long temple in place of Hui long.Of course, this was also for his own good. Venerable Dragon Emperor and the others were going to fight venerable sword.As Yunxiao's direct descendant, it was safer for him to stay in Huilong temple.Moreover, Yunxiao did not want to face neo martial directly at this moment. Huilong was only an external force. He was the venerable sovereign of the cloud world, a true venerable sovereign of a great world. It was easy for others to find out the origin of his great Dao of the great world."Tian Fang ..."This person looked into the distance. Tian Fang wasn't far from him.Although Tian Fang used to be in a rank nine world, it was now just a nest for itinerant cultivators. He knew that many high-level venerable sovereigns were keeping an eye on this place, but it seemed that they had not found anything.If he didn't have to, he wouldn't have bothered to go to Tian Fang.There weren't many opportunities, and those so-called Taoist connotation places hadn't had any Taoist connotation for many years. He had been to the dark Demon Ridge and didn't sense anything. It was a waste of time."Empty ... Son of God of light ..."This was what he needed to pay attention to on this trip.However, his opponent was only at the fifth step. Even if he was the Son of God of light, he was not afraid."Last time, I heard that the universe of the great Dao appeared in tianfang world ... I don't know if it's true or not!"He started to think again. Previously, the realm Lord had asked him to return to the Dragon Temple with the same intention. He wanted him to investigate carefully.After all, Hui long and the others were only itinerant venerable sovereigns, not real venerable sovereigns of major worlds.He might not be able to discover the great Dao universe.As for him, as a sixth level venerable sovereign of the great world, he might be able to sense something different.When he thought about this, he still had some expectations.He hoped that this trip to Tian Fang would bring him some benefits. As for venerable the sword ... Forget it, he'd better stay away from him. The Silver Moon King from before was clearly not strong, but he had provoked a rank six Primal Chaos lightning tribulation. It was terrifying.The chaos was too complicated, so it was safer to go to tianfang.……Just as the venerable sovereign was about to arrive, Li Hao was immersed in the fire Mountain, sensing the weak fire elemental power and never left.This place ... Was the graveyard where he was going to ambush and kill all the Hui long emperors.On the fourth day, Qian Wuliang and Heibao arrived at the fire Mountain before Yunxiao's venerable sovereign.The two of them also began to involve Silvermoon's great path universe, trying to see if they could descend here.It was not a secret that the three venerable sovereigns had arrived here. Some venerable sovereigns of the Hui long temple knew about it, but no one came to disturb them. Li Hao had told them before and did not hide anything, so the venerable sovereigns naturally would not disturb their enlightenment.

Chapter 2766 What A Coincidence (3)_7
In fact, they didn't think they would be able to comprehend anything. They had been to this place countless times.……On the fifth day.A human figure appeared near the southern realm gate.Yunxiao's venerable sovereign had arrived!Near the southern realm gate, a venerable sovereign came to receive them with a flattering smile. A sixth level venerable sovereign from a macro world was extremely mysterious and powerful, which made people feel fear."Greetings, senior!"A third level venerable sovereign from the Dragon return temple smiled obsequiously while the cloud heaven venerable sovereign said coldly,""My name is Chi Yun!""Greetings, venerable Emperor Chi Yun!"The rank three venerable sovereign was even more respectful.He knew this person.The cloud world's venerable sovereign Scarlet cloud!A sixth rank venerable sovereign was skilled in the power of fire. It was also a coincidence that the other party was also a fire-element cultivator. Of course, this person had also been to the fire element mountain before but had not gained anything. Therefore, Chi Yun did not care about the fire element mountain this time. Those abandoned Taoist connotation was of no use to him! "Gather all the venerable sovereigns!"Chi Yun didn't bother to say anything more to this person. He had never taken wandering venerable sovereigns and venerable sovereigns of the great worlds seriously, unless they had reached the middle level. The lower level venerable sovereigns were too weak."Senior, please follow me. The other fellow Daoists are already waiting for you in the Dragon return Hall!"Chi Yun nodded slightly, he was still quite aware of this.As he flew back to the Dragon returning temple, he said,""Where's the void?""He seems to have entered the dark Demon Ridge for closed-door cultivation.""Closed-door training?"Chi Yun laughed."That's good. Otherwise, if you encounter someone who's not easy to get along with, you'll give up your good Son of God of light and come here to comprehend the power of darkness. Light to darkness? You're quite ambitious, but unfortunately, you've neglected the essentials and focused on the trifles!"He had criticized the Son of God of light, but the rank three venerable sovereign did not dare to.At this moment, he could only laugh drily without saying a word."I don't think so." Chi Yun didn't care."I heard that there was a change in the Tianhe zone last time, and there were signs of the great path universe?""Yes, I think so. I don't know the details. Only a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns have been there."Chi Yun nodded slightly and did not ask any further.He would know when he went back to take a look.At this time, he was almost at Huilong temple. He turned his head and looked into the distance. It was very far, but not too far for venerable sovereigns. It seemed to be the fire Mountain. At this moment, there seemed to be some fire power overflowing. This place had been abandoned for many years, so where did the fire element power come from?He was a little puzzled and looked in that direction.The Dragon returning Hall was already in front of him.The other venerable sovereigns came out of the hall to welcome the top venerable sovereign from the macro world.As for Chi Yun, he turned his head to take a look and was a little puzzled,""Have there been any movements from Mount Huoxing recently?"The crowd looked at each other. A first level venerable sovereign, who was venerable sovereign Yu Chen, thought of something and hurriedly walked out, saying,""Senior, there is no movement. It's just that a few venerable sovereigns have come recently and are comprehending the Taoist connotation there.""The Taoist connotation?"Chi Yun laughed in spite of himself. There was no Taoist connotation there now.However, in the next moment, he frowned again. Not only him, but the other venerable sovereigns were also a little confused. A wave of heat hit them, and they could feel a fire power overflowing from far away."Huh?" Chi Yun was startled.What was going on?At such a distance, the fire element power was spreading ... This ... His expression changed. The next moment, he seemed to be pleasantly surprised."The Taoist connotation?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The other venerable sovereigns were also shocked!In the next moment, some venerable sovereigns started to flatter him crazily,""As soon as senior arrived, the fire element mountain, which has been silent for many years, suddenly erupted with a Dao accumulation. This is the good fortune that senior brought! He's a top-notch venerable sovereign from a large world, and it looks like even the disappeared venerable sovereign Tian Fang has to give him face ..."Bullshit!Chi Yun cursed in his heart. Supreme Emperor Tian Fang, a rank nine Supreme Emperor, would he give me face?Of course, he did not say anything.At this moment, there was a strange look in his eyes. He was really ... Lucky.He was a fire-element cultivator, and his Taoist connotation exploded the moment he came. His luck was really good!"Let's go and take a look!"He didn't bother to exchange pleasantries with the others and quickly rushed over.He didn't have the mood to take these people with him ... But he had just arrived, and everyone was welcoming him. The venerable sovereign rarely saw his Taoist connotation explode. Since it was a coincidence, he naturally couldn't drive them away.Then let's go together!Anyway, if he really had the Taoist connotation, these guys wouldn't dare to compete with him!At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns were also a little excited. However, they also felt that even if there was such a thing, it was not something they could comprehend. For a moment, they felt a little regretful. If this person had not come, they would have had a chance since they were all low-ranked venerable sovereigns. What a pity!A group of more than ten venerable sovereigns quickly moved towards the fire element mountain. The scene was extremely spectacular.

2767 Chapter 458
Fire element mountain.The flames rose and the sky changed color.An incomparably vast pressure spread in all directions, shaking the heavens and earth.In the void, a Daoist appeared indistinctly, but it was extremely blurry. At this moment, there seemed to be a faint sound of the great Dao echoing in the void, moving the hearts of people.The sound of the great Dao!It was as if a top-notch expert was transmitting the Dao from a distance.Dao was the true Dao.A human might not be a real human.A year ago, Li Hao had traveled through time here and learned a Tao technique. Today, he was vaguely talking about the Tao of fire. The Tao was indeed the truth, the principle of a Level 7 Expert.The chiyun tribe had yet to arrive, but their expressions changed drastically when they heard the Dao voices.As a cultivator of the fire element, he could tell whether it was true or false.He himself was a Grade 6 cultivator, only a grade away from Grade 7.One could tell that this was a true advanced venerable sovereign, a venerable sovereign of the fire element, who was preaching.It was said that the fire-element cultivator here was the five-element emissary of the tianfang world in the past. The fire-element cultivator, Daoist huoyan, cultivated here.Rank 7 venerable sovereign!Chi Yun felt that it was unbelievable. He couldn't believe it.How could it be?Did his arrival really trigger the Taoist connotation of this place?Otherwise ... How could there be such a coincidence?Such an opportunity, such luck, made him excited, but also a little nervous.A Grade 7 cultivator!In fact, there were such people in the cloud world, but there were no seventh level fire-element cultivators in the cloud world. Even the high-level venerable sovereigns in the cloud world did not dare to say that they knew more about the Dao than the high-level venerable sovereigns in tianfang world.At this moment, Chi Yun felt that his opportunity had arrived.Perhaps ... The rank seven opportunity would be in Tian Fang.He increased his speed and was the first to arrive at the fire element mountain.At this moment, flames were spreading all over Mount Huoxing. In the void, the flames formed a human figure, which was exactly the Daoist huoyan that Li Hao had seen. It was extremely lifelike, but upon closer inspection, one would find that it lacked some charm. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Even so, it was still frightening enough for Chi Yun.He stood under the giant and was a little excited. He was scratching his head. He heard the Dao voice but he couldn't hear it clearly. Some parts were suddenly blurred.However, he didn't dare to mess around, afraid that if he broke the Taoist connotation, it would be troublesome.At this time, venerable sovereigns arrived behind him.Chi Yun was a little unhappy.These bastards!"Don't go near the Taoist connotation!"He shouted in a low voice.If these B * stards got close to the shadow and caused the sound of Taoist Huo Yan's Taoist connotation to dissipate, even killing them would not be enough to pay for it!He himself was being very careful, but these guys were all very carefree. Some of them even wanted to rush into the Taoist connotation. If Chi Yun had not endured it for a while, he would have wanted to kill them. Even if he wanted to check his Taoist connotation, now was not the time.He would have to wait for a while until he finished listening to Huo Yan's explanation of the fire element Dao. A seventh rank venerable sovereign like him, and one from an ancient ninth rank world at that, would definitely be able to use his words as a reference.The venerable sovereigns around him quickly fell silent and didn't dare to speak.Their eyes were burning with passion, but they didn't dare to say anything and just listened quietly.This Taoist connotation was a little different from the Taoist connotations of the past.In the past, there was no such sound of the great Dao. One had to comprehend it by themselves. They had also encountered the eruption of Taoist connotation, but it was only a vague feeling. One had to enter it by themselves and comprehend it silently. Everyone had different insights.But today, there was actually an ancient expert directly imparting the Dao!This was unbelievable!The fire element mountain could actually produce such a Taoist connotation?It was equivalent to a high-level venerable sovereign preaching in front of you. Such an opportunity was hard to come by in their lifetime.……At this moment, someone was standing inside Daoist huoyan's shadow. It was Li Hao.It was presented in front of everyone.However, at this moment, no one discovered it and no one dared to act rashly.The voice of the great Dao was real, and so was the preaching.The more powerful one was, the more one would understand how real, ancient, and useful the grade 7 Dao was.Since that was the case, who would dare to attack The Phantom?No one dared to!Even if they did not cultivate the fire-type Dao, they would still want to listen. Even if they were all seventh rank venerable sovereigns, it was a good thing to hear the other seventh rank venerable sovereigns 'explanation of Dao.Therefore, Li Hao, who was hiding in the shadow, was not afraid that these people would rush in to kill him or discover him.As long as I hide well, no one will dare to find me. No one can find me.Yes, he didn't dare.Looking at Chi Yun's current state, who would dare to break in and destroy the illusionary figure ... He could kill!Daoist huoyan's shadow was shaking.It was as if he was saying,'if you touch me, I'll collapse ...' In such a situation, who would dare to barge in?Wasn't he afraid that a little investigation would cause The Phantom to dissipate and the great world's rank six venerable sovereign to go crazy?……In the shadow. Li Hao's voice was loud, but it was intermittent, making it hard to hear clearly. It was a little uncomfortable. When it came to the key point, his voice seemed to be much softer.At this moment, Chi Yun was feeling a little uncomfortable.It was as if it had broken at the climax. That feeling ... Made him want to break the shadow.He carefully shifted and got closer to the shadow.When he realized that it sounded more realistic, he was instantly overjoyed.Just as he was about to get closer, the shadow trembled as if it was about to collapse. He was so frightened that he hurriedly stopped, and his movements became much smaller. He slowly approached it bit by bit, and only when he found that the shadow was no longer moving did he feel a little more at ease.

2768 Chapter 458
As he listened, he moved closer. His movements were very slow and careful. He wasn't even this careful when he was serving the Lord of the clouds.The cloud Master was a level eight venerable sovereign. He was stronger than the person in front of him when he was still around.But ... The Lord of the clouds was not a fire element cultivator.Moreover, the cloud Master would not preach for no reason. At their level, they rarely preached.……The cultivators below didn't dare to get close. At this moment, each and every one of them was listening attentively. They were intoxicated and somewhat happy.However, there was one person who was a little confused.Yu Chen!At this moment, he felt a little strange, not because of the Taoist connotation. The Taoist connotation seemed real, and there was no way to fake it. From the looks of it, unless a rank seven venerable sovereign faked it, Chi Yun would not be so anxious.What he found strange was that before this, Supreme Emperor white light and the others had been cultivating here. Today, the Taoist connotation had appeared, but they had disappeared. It was strange.Logically, these people should have appeared immediately when the Taoist connotation appeared.Or could it be that he sensed Chi Yun's aura and escaped because he was worried and afraid?He was a little suspicious, but at this moment, no one cared about this, nor did they care about this.There was a sixth-level venerable sovereign of a major world here.As for the Tier 3 and Tier 2 demons, even if they were hiding nearby, even if they had some ideas ... What was the use?It was completely useless!"Should we inform the void Emperor about the appearance of the Dao accumulations?" someone asked."Idiot, are you looking for death? Kong Ji was the son of the God of Light. Who was venerable Emperor Scarlet cloud? The venerable sovereign of the clouds!"Someone cursed in his mind.On any other day, even if the venerable Dragon Emperor was here, he would hesitate to inform Kong Ji. However, since this was a rank six venerable Emperor from a great world, and an enemy of the divine light realm ... He could not afford to not kill Kong Ji.And even called for someone to listen?If Chi Yun knew about it, he would have to kill him. If he didn't dare to kill the Son of God of light, he wouldn't dare to kill a low-rank venerable sovereign like you."That's true ..."The man was a little embarrassed. He just wanted to please Kong Ji. After all, Kong Ji had a high status. However, he soon came back to his senses. Hui long temple was supported by the great cloud world. If he informed Kong Ji, he would be making peace with the other party.He didn't think too much about it and just listened.This was a rare opportunity!Looking at the sound of the great Dao, it might not last long. Listen to it more. Even if you don't understand it, you can still remember it first.As for venerable Emperor Scarlet cloud, he was still approaching.He also realized that as long as he moved slightly, it wouldn't affect The Phantom. Moreover, every time he got closer, he could hear it more clearly. He was even more delighted.He even had a feeling that ... There seemed to be a universe hidden in this Phantom, a universe of the great Dao.It was an incredible feeling! But at this moment, he didn't dare to explore it rashly. He only felt that this place was extremely magical. As a sixth-level venerable sovereign of a great world, he had a wide range of knowledge and knew the mysteries of the great path universe.That hazy feeling of great Dao was exactly the same as when he comprehended the Dao of the clouds normally!He even had a thought ... Could it be that ... Tian Fang's great Dao universe was about to recover?Was it resurrected at this moment?Oh my God!Even though he had reached the sixth rank, he was still overjoyed. If that was the case, it would not be difficult for him to reach the seventh rank.It was extremely difficult to go from Grade 6 to Grade 7.The huge cloud world had existed for countless years. The cloud land was at least a million years old and might not have been the first cloud Lord. Anyway, Chi Yun did not know what had happened a million years ago.However, there were only five advanced venerable sovereigns in the great cloud world.The Lord of the clouds was at level eight, while the remaining four at Level Seven were all old-school venerable sovereigns. They were almost from the same era as the Lord of the clouds, having lived for more than a million years.As for those who came later, Yunxiao had not given birth to any high-level venerable sovereigns in the past million years. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This showed how difficult it was to reach the advanced venerable sovereign level!Of course, there was another reason. It was because the Lord of the cloud had not advanced to the ninth level. If a seventh level was born, the cloud great Dao universe would not be able to accommodate it.A million years had passed, yet no advanced venerable sovereign had been born! Would he have the chance to advance to the advanced level here today?Then, he thought of another legend. If one advanced to a high-stage venerable sovereign in Tian Fang, he had the chance to become the master of Tian Fang. However, the premise was that he was not a venerable sovereign of the great Dao universe. Of course, this was only a legend. Could a venerable sovereign of the great Dao universe not advance here?If I really find the Tian Fang great Dao, it's not impossible for me to escape from the clouds!Countless thoughts appeared in Chi Yun's mind.Although he was still listening to the voice of the great path, at this moment, some thoughts emerged. There were too many venerable sovereigns here. Once the great path universe really appeared, although these people were weak, would they join forces to fight with him?What wouldn't venerable sovereigns dare to do for opportunities?16 venerable sovereigns!Even if they were all beginner venerable sovereigns, he was not an advanced venerable sovereign. If they really joined forces to kill him, he would also feel uncomfortable. Once the battle caused too much commotion, it would lead to other venerable sovereigns from other regions coming over, which would be even more troublesome.At this moment, he even had the intention to kill.And all of this was because of Li Hao.A weak universe of the great path appeared inside the shadow, and a human face appeared indistinctly-Qian Wuliang!The sound of the great Dao was mixed with a little bit of extremely weak bewitching power.Bewitching people's hearts!If Chi Yun was bewitched, it would be the best. He could kill the other venerable sovereigns directly and get injured. At that time, it would be easier to deal with them.If he wasn't bewitched ... It didn't matter.

2769 Chapter 458
He lured the opponent closer step by step. In a battle between experts, the opponent was extremely close. It was also an opportunity to kill quickly.Li Hao continued to preach!The red Cloud continued to approach.Even the venerable sovereigns behind him were approaching carefully. Chi Yun's expression changed as if he was unhappy, but he didn't show it. These guys really deserved to die!This Grade 7 path, is it something you guys should listen to?Can you understand what I am saying?What a waste of opportunity!Moreover, the Taoist connotation of this place might be reduced because of these people. Could these bastards at least bear the responsibility?The more he thought about it, the angrier he got!He really wanted to kill them!……At the same time.The southern realm gate.A group of guards were still standing guard out of boredom.In the primordial chaos, it was quite normal for people to go away for months or even years.After the return Dragon Emperor and the others left, no one came to the southern realm gate.It was very quiet!The few who stayed behind were all cultivating, waiting for the next person to arrive.They only had one mission here, which was to find venerable sovereigns that they could rope in, not to stop anyone. For example, when Li Hao first came, the giant pincer welcomed him warmly, hoping that he could join the returning Dragon Temple.At this moment, the teleportation array trembled slightly.The few left-behind guards looked back and didn't really care.In tianfang, the teleportation formation could be used at will as long as you didn't break it on purpose. There were also a few people under venerable sovereign guarding the formation. They weren't venerable sovereigns, and venerable sovereigns weren't that free, nor were they that cheap.Guarding the gate and overseeing things were not the duty of venerable sovereigns.Any venerable sovereign, regardless of their rank, was the master of Tian Fang. No master would guard the door.The few left-behind guards turned their heads and saw a familiar face.Someone saw the giant pincers and laughed."Giant pincer, what are you doing here?"Another guard joked,"could it be that you're preparing to run?" Giant pincer, the chaos is outside. You're not a venerable sovereign, so you'd better stay in tianfang. If you run, you'll die! By the way, didn't you accept a mission to serve the venerable sovereigns from the floating light region? You still have time to run around?"It was the giant pincer.At this moment, the giant pincer scanned the area. There were not many guards nearby, and they were all acting as guides, replacing one guard with another. Under normal circumstances, there would be six guards here.He had also been here for many years.According to neo martial, these six were all at the Heavenly King level. Some were strong and some were weak.According to Silver Moon, they were all at the fourth level of Dao integration or above, and the stronger ones were even at the eighth level. Only a few were at the ninth level, which was the peak of the Heavenly King realm and they were all working hard to become venerable sovereigns. The giant pincers glanced at them and then looked out of the chaos.The mission Li Hao gave him was to kill the guards and close the realm gate if dark clouds vaguely appeared in the chaos.At this moment, the dark clouds had yet to appear.The giant pincer looked at the few of them and smiled.""I came here to take a look. That senior white light said that he might have other companions who might come. He asked me to guard here for a few days. If they come, I'll bring them over together." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  As soon as he said this, the few of them cursed in their hearts. I haven't met venerable sovereigns for a few days, and now you have to take them away. How unlucky.However, when they thought that this batch of venerable sovereigns might not be anything good, otherwise, Supreme Emperor Yu Chen would not have handed them over to the giant pincer. Everyone was relieved. With a few more venerable sovereigns, you should just die early!They were all competitors, and the giant pincers were not weak. Otherwise, they would not have had the opportunity to receive Li Hao last time.Such a person was a competitor to the guards.With one less, they would have a greater chance of receiving venerable sovereigns the next time they came.At this moment, the giant pincer looked out of the chaos. A dark cloud began to appear out of thin air. The guards were a little puzzled and looked into the distance. What was that?The giant pincers knew that Li Hao had probably taken action.He shuddered.Killing these guards ... Was equivalent to officially rebelling and returning to the Dragon Temple.But ... Who would care?The Huilong temple had provoked this person, and their existence was a problem."What's that?"The giant pincer shouted. Initially, there were some people who did not pay attention to it, but at this moment, they quickly looked into the distance. Some people saw the dark clouds and felt a little strange."This ... This ... Could this be the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?"There didn't seem to be anything else in the primordial chaos apart from the chaos lightning tribulation.But ... Why would he appear here?Of course, he had heard that the Silver Moon King would often appear in the place where he lived, but he was far away from here. Perhaps he had a battle with the Hui long Emperor and the others, so he would not be here.Then this thing ... Where did it come from?The guards were a little puzzled."Quickly inform the temple that there's a change in the chaos ..."Someone reacted and informed the venerable sovereigns who had returned to the Dragon Temple.As they were talking, someone noticed that something was wrong. He turned around and the next moment, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets!A huge crab appeared in front of him.As for the two guards behind him, they had been silently cut off by the huge pincers!He died without a sound!The pincers were already infinitely close to the level of half-emperors. According to Silvermoon, they had already surpassed the ninth level of the Dao integration stage or had combined the Dao of illusion and the Dao of truth ... They were not much different from half-emperors.However, there were only a group of Heavenly King-level existences here. The weaker ones had just stepped into the Heavenly King realm.
