What they were worried about was that if too many level eight venerable sovereigns left, not only would the outside world be dangerous, but Samsara's own land would also be dangerous.Fu Sheng also understood this, but ... Do you want me not to pursue him?How was that possible?It was impossible!It was simply a nightmare to not care about the iron eater!The two grade 8 experts behind him looked at each other helplessly. It seemed like Fu Sheng was determined.Even if there was a trap, he had to step into it.But ... Could it be a trap?They didn't know either. However, it was impossible for three rank eights to hunt him down at the same time for the sake of iron-eating. It was too dangerous. The Samsara Emperor was still in seclusion and trying to break through to a higher level.It would be even more troublesome if the enemy attacked."Men, quickly mobilize two ... No, four rank seven experts to follow venerable sovereign Fu Sheng. If there's any danger, you'll be held responsible!"They were worried that two rank 7s would not be enough.If there were four of them, they would be able to fight even if they encountered a grade 8.This way, even if there was a trap, unless the other party sent several level 8s, it would not be easy to take down Fu Sheng and the others. Under normal circumstances, one level 7 and one level 8 would be enough.But ... At this stage, how could they be at ease?Soon, the four rank seven venerable sovereigns gave chase.Venerable sovereign fleeting life sensed it but didn't say anything. He didn't think it was necessary. Of course, with the cooperation of four seventh-tier cultivators, if they caught up with the other party, iron Shishi would be dead for sure. He would have no way to escape!At this moment, venerable sovereign fleeting life was chasing after the other party's aura with a cold and sharp gaze. A trap?He knew a little about the iron-eating business. He had never come out of the square region, so how could he have any accomplices?Silver Moon?Neo martial?Or ... Could it be that the great emperor of the monster race in the South, the Supreme Emperor of spring and autumn, had extended his influence over and taken in the iron-eating beast? Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Otherwise, a monster race venerable sovereign who had offended long Zhan, the Overlord of the four regions, ordinary worlds would not dare to easily take in the other party.No matter what, no matter who it was ... No matter if there was a trap or not, when he saw the iron eater, he would not let this matter rest!On this day, powerful auras swept through the chaos. No one paid any attention to the boundaries of the nine Heavens. The iron-eating venerable sovereign was fleeing for his life!He didn't know how to escape. The human King didn't say anything, he just said ..."Run."He could run however he wanted, the faster and further the better!But ... How could he run?Where are you going?Could it be that the human King had run away after seeing more experts?A level eight ... The human King said that at most two level Seven experts would come. Good Lord, why were there four?The human King had entered level eight. In other words, even if the human King brought iron Harrier to deal with Fu Sheng, he and iron Harrier might have to face the encirclement of four level Seven venerable sovereigns from the level eight universe?This ... Wasn't this still very dangerous? Is this still called fishing?Also, why is Fu Sheng, this bastard, so timid? he's a rank eight, yet he met his enemies at his doorstep with four rank seven venerable sovereigns. In the world of reincarnation, were all rank seven venerable sovereigns so lacking in dignity?To be a hatchet man?Four of them had been dispatched at once, which was comparable to the number of experts in a type 8 world.It was said that Samsara only had a dozen rank Sevens. Was it appropriate to send out a third of them just to kill him?Iron eater, who had always wanted to be strong, couldn't hold it in anymore.Human King, where are you?When are you going to make your move?Fu Sheng's speed was extremely fast. If it wasn't for the fact that he had to take care of the grade 7 experts behind him, he might have already caught up.……The iron eater venerable Emperor continued to move.As he ran and ran, a world seemed to appear in the distance. He couldn't care about it anymore and escaped from the side of the world.In the world, a group of people was observing the world. Suddenly, Li Hao looked outside. The next moment, he appeared near the realm gate. Then, he opened his mouth, and beside him, Kong Ji was also dumbfounded.After a long time, he looked at Li Hao and asked,"is it ... Iron-eating?"Strange!How did he meet the iron-eating Thearch here?They had just arrived in the firmament world and were still looking at the world.It was like visiting a house.However, before he could do anything, he actually saw the iron eater Supreme Emperor. That iconic big iron stick and those huge black and white eye circles. Who else could it be other than him?He definitely wouldn't have mistaken her for someone else.Li Hao shook his head, not sure.However ... In the next moment, his expression changed slightly, and he instantly retreated behind the realm gate. At this time, a level 8 aura also emerged instantly. His voice was cold and spread in all directions,""I am the reincarnation realm, Fu Sheng! I'm currently chasing after a blood feud and I'm passing by various worlds. If I've offended you in any way, please forgive me. If there's a world Lord who's willing to stop me, I'll definitely reward you heavily!"Reincarnation, floating life Emperor.At that moment, Imperial venerable Kang Han's face was filled with shock. He said in a low voice,""A rank eight venerable sovereign in the world of reincarnation ..."Li Hao was confused. Iron eater had an enemy here?How strange!'Alright, that's not the point. The point is that he can really cause trouble. Fortunately, I didn't go with him at that time. Look, I've just come out and I'm already fighting with one of the most powerful forces in the Eastern Region!'He didn't stop!Why did you run to the Samsara world for no reason? you obviously met him. The chaos is so big, can't you avoid him?Just as he was thinking about it, he felt 4 more Grade 7 auras."Five experts, one level 8, four level 7 ..." He was stunned."This iron eater is in big trouble!"It looked like they were about to be caught up.The two sides were not far from each other.

Chapter 3381 Four Pack Wolves (3)
This was the seventh layer of heaven, and it seemed that they would have to continue chasing for a while. However, it was obvious that the iron eater's speed was not as fast as the other party 's. If it wasn't for the fact that the other party had to inform them when passing through a Jie to avoid misunderstandings, they would have caught up with it long ago.An outsider like the iron-eating Supreme Emperor could be ignored, but a rank eight Supreme Emperor of the world of reincarnation suddenly led four rank seven Supreme emperors to run amuck. Who wouldn't be wary of this?"Greetings, senior Fu Sheng ... It's a pity that I didn't hear the message earlier and didn't have time to stop him. If I had known earlier, I would have definitely stopped him ..." Li Hao said.He had transformed into Xiao Chen's voice, but venerable Emperor Fu Sheng didn't stop. He didn't care too much. In fact, he just wanted to tell everyone that he was chasing after the enemy and not to deal with them.As for the other world overlords, it didn't matter if they acted or not.He didn't even bother to say any more polite words, but since someone had responded, he still replied,""It's fine!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared!Wu Shan and the others all looked at Li Hao. You're really bold. We're outsiders and thieves here. Aren't you afraid that they'll really stop and discuss with you to let you meet them outside?You're really bored!Li Hao didn't care. He touched his chin, looked in the direction that the group of people had left, and smiled."Iron-eating Thearch ... You're quite bold. It's said that the world of reincarnation is in the ninth heaven, right? He actually ran to the nine Heavens and even to the vicinity of the world of Samsara ... What a coincidence!"Why did he feel that it was a little ... Not quite in line with the iron-eating Emperor's personality?He was upright, not crazy.Since it was a blood feud, he should know something about it. It didn't make sense for him to go straight to his enemy's territory as soon as he left Sifang region, right?Are you tired of living?Li Hao glanced into the distance and chuckled.""This is really interesting. This style ... Is a little ... Unusual!"On the side, second cat was deep in thought and nodded.Yes, it was an unusual style.This style ... Was vaguely familiar.Li Hao laughed again."It's such a big commotion that experts from all over the nine Heavens are going to watch the show. Six high-level experts appeared. One fled, five chased, and an eighth-level expert killed a seventh-level expert. They traversed the world ... It's such a big commotion ... Why does that person want to cause trouble wherever he goes?" The others were still in a daze, but second cat understood.The human King?Could it be related to the human King?Who knew? looking at the iron eater's situation, it was too coincidental, so coincidental that ... It felt like it was deliberately looking for trouble. In the entire four-sided domain, who would dare to find trouble and fish so unscrupulously ... Other than the human King?Li Hao smiled."That senior of ours is always so understanding. Although I, Silver Moon, have taken the blame for him a few times, I have to say ... He always brings us some surprises!"After saying this, he paused and smiled."Since that's the case ... Then ... Let's make a killing. I owe him a seventh-tier universe. Hmm, this is not bad!"He looked at the firmament world and laughed,"Get to work. Pack up the firmament world and bring it away. Put all the people into the world of faith ... Hmm, it's hard to believe in it. I'll trick some of them into believing in it first. I'll talk about the ones I can't believe in later ... As for the rest, I'll destroy them first and pack up the entire world ..." After he finished speaking, he glanced at Emperor firmament, whose expression had changed drastically, and laughed."It's really unfortunate. I'm going to be busy. I'm afraid I don't have time to play with you."Emperor firmament's expression changed drastically!"You guys ..."In an instant, a sword flashed over and beheaded him!The universe of the great path instantly fluctuated, causing a great commotion. But at this moment, who would care?In the vicinity, six powerful auras were emerging. This place was somewhat frightened and fluctuated the great path universe, preparing to defend. What was so strange about it?Li Hao instantly stepped into the Dao universe.In the blink of an eye, they arrived in the depths of the universe.A daosource star appeared.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  It was huge, like a heart.Xiao Chen's main cultivation path was not too special. Li Hao simply comprehended it, and at this moment, there were still fluctuations of Xiao Chen's will. It shook violently and roared madly,"You can't kill me. If you kill me, the chaos heavens realm will definitely learn of this ....""Huntian, do you know who I am?"Li Hao chuckled."Even if I know ... I won't care about it soon. In this place, even a rank eight can die, and the one who died was a rank eight in the world of Samsara. Who would care about your life or death?"Xiao Chen was shocked. What did he mean?Was he saying that Fu Sheng would die?How could this be?Before he had time to think, Li Hao rushed into the daosource. In the blink of an eye, the stars of the great path were torn apart like silk. With a rumble, the level Seven daosource was completely torn apart!The entire great path universe instantly shook.Xiao Chen's illusionary figure appeared and roared in fear,""I ... I can surrender ... I'm the Lord of the type 7 realm ..."A top-notch existence!A tier 7 was considered an expert anywhere. Even if they surrendered and signed a great Dao agreement, they would not dare to go against it.I can surrender!However, Li Hao's head ached when he heard this. Even he disliked his side. More and more experts were joining, and he was almost out of control. He was not willing to accept strangers.Wu Shan, the Thunderbolt master, Kong Ji, and Sen LAN had either been working together or observing each other for some time ...

Chapter 3382 The Four Pack Of Wolves
In any case, they all shared some common topics.You're a guy who wants to kill me, so we don't have anything in common.BOOM!The sword rippled, and in the blink of an eye, The Phantom collapsed.The venerable sovereigns in the entire firmament realm quickly sensed it and their expressions changed. The great Dao of the entire world shook violently, and the world was also shaking violently. Kong Ji and the others also took action!It was too easy for a group of seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns to deal with a group of venerable sovereigns who did not have any advanced level venerable sovereigns!At this moment, the Queen also began to work.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  This time, these people did not believe in her.But ... A Tier 4 Queen was not something a Tier 1 queen could compare to. Although this was a large world, and it had been relatively stable before, so people's hearts were not so easy to subdue, so what?On one hand, she used her Silver Moon body to fool the people. If she could fool everyone, there would be people who would believe her.On one hand, the appearance of the divine Kingdom was like a heavenly world.Believers would take the initiative to enter the divine Kingdom. However, Asura hell appeared under the divine Kingdom today. It was like Lin Hongyu's hell of death. The Queen's voice sounded,""Those who believe in me, enter the divine Kingdom! Those who don't believe in me will be sent to hell and sink into oblivion for all eternity!"There were all kinds of torture and demons with the aura of death in hell ... There was even a female demon. On closer look ... It actually ... Actually had some resemblance to Lin Hongyu.Li Hao had just walked out of the Dao universe when he saw this scene. His expression changed slightly.On one hand, they were shocked that the Queen had actually opened up a different area. Within the divine Kingdom, she had even opened up the so-called hell, which was something to be surprised about.However, the next moment, he was a little speechless.Are you looking for trouble?Why did the Demon King of Hell ... Look like Lin Hongyu?"Lin Hongyu is not here. She went to the great li realm to gain enlightenment of life and death to build her own hell of death. You are here to build her hell of being a Demon King."If I see you one day ... I'll definitely cause you trouble.He was looking for trouble!Li Hao couldn't be bothered. He instantly appeared between heaven and earth and grabbed with his hand. In the entire world, countless great Dao laws collapsed. The entire world was rapidly compressed by him, and countless creatures fled frantically.Some entered the God Country, some were directly absorbed by hell, and some wanted to leave the realm, but before they could do so, they were instantly destroyed!Nirvana wasn't death, it was just the destruction of everything.It could still be resuscitated.Above, the void was also destroying everything, not allowing any living being to escape and leak the news.The dead creatures were also absorbed into the Queen's hell.Just like that, the countless living beings in the grade 7 world were all sucked away in the blink of an eye.The entire world was being compressed crazily. A rank 7 world would be very large if it wasn't compressed. However, in Li Hao's hands, it gradually began to shrink.As for whether or not the disappearance of a rank seven world would be observed and noticed ...  Usually, it would be fine, but not today.After today ... What does it have to do with me?The human King did it!The neo martial human King was fiendish. It was possible that he would be unhappy with a tier 7 world and shatter it with one slash.Am I right?Who would care about a seventh rank venerable sovereign? even if he was huntian's subordinate, he could also be from another eighth rank world. There would definitely be more than one or two people who wanted to kill huntian's eyes and ears.At this moment, Li Hao's smile was extremely bright.After a while, the world fell into Li Hao's hand like a small ball with a boom. He did not need to carry the creatures in the world with him, and he could directly compress them. Although a level 7 great world was extremely heavy, it was not a problem for Li Hao.Throwing the world to second cat, Li Hao smiled and said,""Senior second cat, I'll have to trouble you. Take it first, I'll use it to pay my debts later."Return to who?The human King.He looked into the distance and could vaguely sense some auras. He laughed,""There's going to be a good show this time. I'm afraid everyone is watching ... Let's go to the Gemini twins!"Everyone's eyes flickered, and they laughed. "You're not going to exchange anymore?""They're going to kill me, what's the point of exchanging?"Li Hao smiled and disappeared instantly, heading straight for the eighth heaven. There was one level-eight Supreme Emperor in the Twin universes, and there seemed to be six level-seven Supreme emperors. They were not weak, and they ruled over the native universe. They were even stronger.He wasn't afraid, but it would be difficult to quickly take down the other party.The Thunderbolt master and Sen LAN didn't come. If they did, they would have a high chance of success.Countless thoughts appeared in his mind. He did not return to look for the Thunderbolt master and the others. Instead, he quickly said,"Senior Wushan, he knows you. Second cat, he should also know Emperor Cang. The two of you are slightly behind ...""I disguised myself as firmament dust and something happened. The other party must have felt some changes. Hehe ... This is a good opportunity. As expected, the heavens are helping me ... No, the human King is helping me ... No, the human King is always like this ... I like him!"Li Hao smiled.Is the heavens helping me?It wasn 't.It was the human King!Was the human King doing this on purpose?No, it was because the human King wanted to stir up trouble on his own. It was good. The human King's personality was a headache, but it also made people happy. With him around, one would never have to worry. This place was too peaceful and quiet, making one unable to perform.With him around, it was the only chance for those who wanted to fish in troubled waters.It was a rare opportunity.If he took advantage of this now, someone might have reacted if he waited a little longer.Li Hao was extremely fast.

Chapter 3383 Four Pack Of Wolves (1)_5
He continued to shuttle back and forth, even stepping into the river of time, his speed becoming faster and faster.……Very quickly, the Twin universes appeared in the eighth heaven.Although it was divided into Nine Heavens, there were no obvious barriers. Other than the slightly denser chaotic force acting as a barrier, the eighth and seventh heavens were all in the same spatial dimension.At that moment, Supreme Emperor di yang also felt some movement. After chasing for so long, iron eater Supreme Emperor and the others were not too far away from the Twin universes.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Just as Supreme Emperor di yang was frowning ...Suddenly, an aura from the outside world spread over.His expression changed slightly. Xiao Chen had just left not long ago. Why had he returned?It seemed that he had not left for long.He quickly disappeared and reappeared near the realm gate. At that moment, Emperor Xiaochen's aura seemed to be fluctuating and unstable. He was panting, but he looked overjoyed."Senior di yang, great news!"What?Di yang was slightly stunned. Li Hao pointed into the distance."Senior, did you sense it?"Di yang frowned slightly and said calmly,"I have a feeling. It seems like there is some turbulence. What's wrong? do you know?""Reincarnation sovereign fleeting life is chasing after iron eater sovereign from four regions ..."So that was how it was!I thought it was something important.He didn't care too much and only frowned slightly.""Is there a need for such a big formation to chase after a tier 7?"Don't tell me he has ulterior motives.Intimidate everyone?Or was he doing something in secret?He instantly fell into deep thought, while Li Hao hurriedly said,""Senior, you might not know this, but iron-eater and the neo martial human King have already secretly joined forces. This means that ... The neo martial human King is preparing to ambush venerable sovereign fleeting life!""What?"Thearch earth yang was stunned.Looking at Li Hao, Li Hao was ecstatic.""Senior di yang, this is your chance! "Our original intention was to deal with and kill the new martial artists. Now, the other party has taken the initiative to come to our door. The new martial human King has entered the eighth rank and must be extremely arrogant. That's why he dared to ambush a rebirth level eight! This is our chance ... We'll benefit from this! "Since the other party is ambushing us, they must have some confidence. However, Samsara isn't to be trifled with. No matter who dies, it's not a loss for us ... Senior, even if we gather people and set up an ambush, the other party won't believe us. At this moment, there's still someone who dares to set up an ambush behind us. The human King thinks that no one knows, but our chaos heaven realm has powerful intelligence. We've received the news long ago ..."Di Yang's eyes flickered, and he felt a little cold.Human King? New martial!Last time, he was defeated by neo martial and fled in a sorry state, almost dying there. He also hated neo martial extremely. The Dragon Master was the enemy who killed his brother, and neo martial was the enemy who humiliated him!Don't let them off!His eyes flickered,'if a neo martial artist ... Steps into level eight, even Fu Sheng ... Will be in danger! We'll ambush them. Have you gathered all your men?"Li Hao said hurriedly,"not so soon, but soon. In a short time, we've only gathered one level eight and a few Level Seven ... They're on their way, but not so soon. I didn't expect a conflict to break out so soon. Time waits for no one. Senior, do you want to make a move now, or ... Wait a little longer? "Wait a little longer. I can still gather a few powerhouses to come, but we might miss this opportunity ...""The chaos is too big," he said anxiously."It's probably very difficult to get there quickly. At present, we can only confirm that there's one rank-8. As for rank-7, there's at most two or three ...Di yang also quickly calculated. One level 8, including himself, that was two.As for the seventh step, he had six more on his side, while firmament's side, including him, might have three or four ...Two level 8s and about ten Level 7s. Not weak, definitely not weak! As for Fu Sheng ... Because he was far away, he couldn't feel it clearly. He asked,""How many people did Fu Sheng bring?""Four rank seven!"Di yang nodded slightly and judged again. With four of them and Fu Sheng, it would not be easy for neo martial arts to take down the other party.As these thoughts flashed through his mind, he looked at Li Hao and said in a low voice,""Are you sure that the grade-8 you summoned will be able to arrive in time?""I'm sure!"Li Hao nodded and said,"but I can't guarantee the exact time. However, if they don't come ... We can give up. We just need to follow them. We don't have to attack now. We can delay for a while. When I gather enough people, it might be more stable ..."More stable?How long would that take?This was indeed a rare opportunity!"Are you sure that neo martial and iron eater are mixed together?""I'm sure!"Li Hao said solemnly,"this is the news sent back by my chaos heaven universe's spy. It can't be fake. Senior, don't worry. Chaos heaven has been planning for the chaos for many years and has been paying close attention to the four-sided domain. Otherwise, it wouldn't have known that senior Tian Yang ... Cough, cough, it wouldn't have known so much about the four-sided domain!"He said sternly,"this time, iron eater provoked Fu Sheng and took the initiative to appear in the nine Heavens to lure Fu Sheng out. It must be an ambush set by the human King to kill the strong!" Of course, if senior di yang feels that it is inappropriate ... We can send a message to the world of reincarnation and ask the Samsara Emperor to take action personally ..."Di yang didn't say anything.Why did he have to inform Samsara?The world of reincarnation was the target that all the rank eights in the East feared. It would be best if a rank eight died, as it would be equal to the extreme Ice world. He was happy to see one rank eight and four rank Sevens less.

Chapter 3384 Four Pack Of Wolves (1)_6
Why would he inform the world of Samsara?It would be good if he really died!The best outcome would be for both sides to suffer heavy losses, and perhaps ... He could even sit back and reap the benefits."I can do it, but ... I can only do it myself ... At most, I can bring three level 7s ..." He quickly said.He was prepared to leave three tier 7 experts to guard the land in case of any accidents.Li Hao frowned slightly."This ... It's not impossible. It's just that if the human king and emperor Cang have entered level eight on neo martial, and there's also a Supreme neo martial artist on my side ... I'll be fine. I can wait a little longer. We'll take action when the opportunity arises. If there aren't enough experts on my side, we can wait for the next time ..."Supreme Emperor di yang frowned slightly.After hesitating for a moment, he quickly said,"take the four of them with you. Let's take a look first. Leave two level 7s to guard the Twin universes ... Otherwise, it will be very troublesome if any changes occur. With two level 7s, even if there are level 8s attacking, they can hold on for a while and wait for me to return!"Li Hao nodded."It's only right. The Gemini is the master, and huntian also hopes that the Twin universes can continue to exist here and take root in the East. If the Gemini universe is destroyed, it will be a huge loss for huntian!""Then, let's not delay ... Shall we set off?" he quickly added."Alright!"Supreme Emperor di Yang's eyes flickered as he looked into the distance.Neo martial human King?What a crazy guy. You just left the four-sided domain and you're already challenging Samsara. You're too bold!"It's okay if I can't kill you this time. By then, not only will Samsara kill you, but I will also kill you. Huntian will also kill you. Even the type 8 powerhouses in the Eastern Region might kill you!"Because you're too unstable. You're an unstable element that destroys stability!Soon, he mobilized four level 7s and quickly said,""Come with me. Conceal your auras and be careful!"He then looked at the two Grade 7 guards and said in a low voice,""Look after the realm gate. Before I return, no one is allowed to enter! You two will be stationed near the realm gate, one inside and one outside, ready to support at any time! If there are any changes, directly shake the great Dao universe, and I will return in time! Remember, you can't go out, even if someone provokes you. Don't do anything rash!"With Samsara's previous experience, he had been worried that someone would do this to him.There was no way the two tier 7 experts could leave. As long as no one had entered the realm and was unaware of the situation, there was nothing to be afraid of.As long as there was no problem with these two rank-7s, even if the others came, they wouldn't dare to act rashly against the twins without knowing if he was there or not.He looked into the distance at the slightly chaotic heaven and earth.I'm not as impulsive as Fu Sheng!He was too flamboyant!This time, I'm going to keep a low profile and act in the dark.A fall into a pit, a gain in your wit. Being too flamboyant would not have a good end.The two seventh level venerable sovereigns who stayed behind nodded their heads rapidly. They didn't dare to say anything and were both solemn. Of course, they were also at ease. After all, other than them, no one else knew that the world Overlord had left.It was not a big problem."Let's go!"Supreme Emperor earth yang did not say much, and Li Hao quickly followed. At this moment, he was only a fake, disguising himself as Supreme Emperor firmament through the river of memories. Everything was fine except for the fact that he could not really fight.If he really attacked, he would be exposed.He was also bold because of his skills!He was certain that di yang would not attack him. That was enough. He could lure the snake out of its hole and lure the other party out instead of staying in the great world. Otherwise, it would be difficult to deal with.As for the human King ... No matter if he dealt with this group of people or the human King dealt with Fu Sheng and the others, both sides would have a plan.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Of course, the human King might not know that he was also nearby.Regardless, as long as he made a move, he would know even if he didn't know.Neither of them spoke, but Li Hao was already prepared to provide support. He felt that the human King ... Might have come alone. Otherwise, how could a Supreme neo martial artist let the other party have such a good time when he had just come out?Li Hao believed that the human King was strong, but he had just reached level eight. Could he really kill Fu Sheng and four level Seven venerable sovereigns so easily?There were also some great worlds in the nearby area. Once they interfered, there would be many changes. Human King, have you ever considered this?Probably not.Sometimes, the human King would not even consider that the other party might have the thought of running away if he could not win. He would not care about these unexpected factors at all. This was because thinking too much would actually wear down one's confidence sometimes.At this moment, Li Hao fluctuated the river of time. With the ethereal extent in the hands of several other experts, he quickly sent a message: "Follow me and keep a distance. Come out when I tell you to ... Senior Wushan, you must conceal your aura!"At this moment, he was also observing the Earth Sun.When he realized that the other party was unmoved, he felt at ease.Weak chicken!There was no other reason. He didn't sense any time fluctuations. He was just a weakling. Of course, this was just a thought. Today, the only one who could clearly sense the time fluctuations was the Dragon Lord.That would be a real problem!……At the same time.Outside the world of reincarnation.In the void.Two figures were faintly visible. The Dragon Lord's face was cold. Suddenly, he laughed indifferently."I knew that they wouldn't be so obedient. Samsara would definitely have a conflict with them. But I didn't expect that it wasn't li Hao who accepted them, but ... The human King!" Yes, looking at the style, he must be a human King!This was not Li Hao's style.This was even more interesting.He had also come out. Not only had he come out, but he had also gone straight to Samsara, because he felt that Samsara would have a conflict with that group of people sooner or later.As it turned out, his guess was right.However, he was wrong.Iron eater actually followed the human King.But that's good!At this moment, he showed a smile and threw a mask to Hong Yue. It was a special mask with a special aura fluctuation. He smiled gloomily and said,""Wait! Waiting for Fu Sheng's emergency, waiting for Samsara's rank eights to come to their aid ... Killing a rank eight! "Brother Hongyue, I trust you. I hope you won't let me down. At the very least, help me stall a rank 8. Otherwise ... This time, there must be someone dead. If it's not that person, then it might be someone else!"“……”Red Moon sovereign wanted to curse at this moment!A threat!It was a blatant threat. If he didn't stop a rank eight, he would be the one to die.Damn it!This group of bastards, this group of lunatics, this group of animals.Samsara was a powerful force, but in the end, they were all coveting the other side.The Dragon Lord actually also wanted to ambush and kill the other party's powerhouse!The Dragon Master, on the other hand, looked indifferent. Of course, he had to be killed. The Samsara was a threat to the dragon clan when they left the four-square region. If he could get rid of a few rank eights this time, he would not be afraid of the Samsara Emperor alone!The other party might not be as strong as him.However, the four great rank eights were very troublesome.Since the opportunity had come, how could he miss it?He laughed, and it was a meaningful laugh. As expected, it was the right move to chase out new martial and silver Moon. This was a very good step!At this moment, the entire world of reincarnation remained silent.However, he didn't know that he was already being stared at by many pairs of eyes, like a Wolf!

Chapter 3385 Three-Sided Attack (3)_1
Four packs of wolves appeared.The Eastern Region had been quiet for many years. The overlords had been fighting each other, but a rare war had broken out.Now, the four-sided region was in turmoil. The wolves were released and were eyeing the area like tigers watching their prey.……At this moment.In the seventh heaven.Iron eater was still caught up and stopped.A single metal cudgel shattered the sky, shaking the earth and causing energy ripples to sweep through the world.The iron-eating Emperor transformed into a giant bear and roared,""You killed my brother in the past, and you still dare to pursue me today. You're courting death!"Venerable monarch fleeting life's face was cold.No one would care about what they did, they would only care about what others did to them.He only remembered the humiliation he had suffered in the past.Just like today, iron-eating's iron staff hit him so hard that he vomited blood and all the bones in his body were broken. If long Zhan had not appeared to stop him and if long Zhan had not feared Samsara, he would have died that day.And now, it was time for revenge.A millstone-like weapon appeared in his hand, suppressing the heavens and earth. Life and death, reincarnation, and reincarnation were the rules of the world. He was also an expert in the Dao of life and death, although not as strong as the reincarnation Emperor.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  However, at this moment, as soon as the millstone appeared, it was as if the sky and earth had changed colors. The power of a level 8 martial artist swept through the world!Countless vengeful spirit-like creatures appeared in the sky and covered the iron eater. The howls of the countless vengeful spirits disturbed people's hearts.Be it the demon race or the chaos race, they were not good at nurturing gods.His body was strong, but his God was weak.For many years, Fu Sheng had been thinking about revenge and how to kill iron Shishi. Now, his chance had come.A peak seventh-rank iron eater was very strong ... But without the world's blessing, no matter how strong its body was, it was definitely not a match for an eighth-rank one.Countless vengeful souls were howling. There were humans, demons, and beasts of primordial chaos.Among them, there were many demons. Among them, there were even some iron-eating beasts that seemed to have turned black.At this moment, venerable sovereign fleeting life was no longer as gentle as he was in the world of reincarnation. His eyes were cold and his face was filled with hatred. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice,""Did you see that? Iron eater, haven't you been hiding in the four-sided domain? Over the years, I've traveled the Eastern Region and killed all the iron-eaters, waiting for this day!"The iron eater Thearch was furious!At this moment, he was holding an iron rod and crushing countless vengeful souls. He roared,""You bastard! Is this all you've got? an eighth level venerable sovereign?"The grudges of the past could no longer be traced back to right or wrong.However, in order to vent his anger, he had massacred all the iron-eating people in the area ... The iron-eating venerable Emperor was still furious.The countless vengeful souls covered the sky and the earth, wrapping around iron eater sovereign layer by layer. On the outside, venerable sovereign fleeting life was smiling coldly, as if he was a different person from usual.He was going to torture him to death!Of course, it was also to be safer and to have more confidence in killing the other party. At this moment, he was still very vigilant and did not let his anger completely get to his head. The four rank seven venerable sovereigns surrounded him, and he had only used the vengeful soul path of the reincarnation cycle.He would consume the iron first!If no one appeared, it would be easy for him to kill the iron eater. He wasn't in a hurry.Whoever wanted to take advantage of the battle and sneak an attack on him ... He was thinking too much.……In the distance.In the dense chaotic force, Supreme Emperor earth yang frowned slightly. Beside him, Li Hao also raised his eyebrows slightly.This venerable sovereign fleeting life was more difficult to deal with than he had imagined.The way of life and death?So many vengeful souls. How many living beings had been killed to create so many vengeful souls?Most importantly, these vengeful souls were able to entangle the iron-eating Supreme Emperor.If the human King wanted to launch a surprise attack ... It would probably be a little difficult this time. The four rank seven experts had been guarding around venerable Emperor fleeting life. Although venerable Emperor fleeting life had consumed a lot of energy, it seemed that he had taken precautions.Under such circumstances, Supreme Emperor earth yang was worried that the human King would not show up. Li Hao was wondering if the human King could deal with these people if he showed up.One at the eighth step and four at the seventh step, and it seemed that they were prepared, not a surprise attack in the strict sense ...At this moment, Li Hao was worried for the human King.This time, he might lose the bait, which was the iron eating Supreme Emperor.Supreme Emperor di yang was also a little unhappy.Fu Sheng ... Wasn't so young and impetuous. He thought that Fu Sheng would lose control because of hatred and fight with the iron-eating Mantis, only to be sneak attacked by the human King ...But now ... He was very disappointed.……On the other side.In the chaos, the human King crossed his arms. He was no longer dragging his large saber, but holding it in his arms. Behind him was another iron-eating beast. At this moment, the iron-eating venerable sovereign, iron spade, had a worried expression.This ... This is going to be troublesome.The four tier 7 experts didn't split up. There were more than two of them as expected. That wasn't all. The enemy from back then didn't even make a move, and his big brother was entangled by a portion of their vengeful souls.On the one hand, iron Harrier was worried about his big brother's safety, but on the other hand, he was shocked by the other's methods.So strong!Fu Sheng had not been this powerful back then. Otherwise, he would not have been almost killed by the iron eater Thearch.Then, he looked at the human King, who was unflustered ... This ... This wouldn't do.Tie Zheng wanted to speak a few times, but the human King would always turn around and look at him, forcing him to swallow his words.If the human King still doesn't make a move, my big brother will be finished.

Chapter 3386 Three-Pronged Attack (2)
Iron Harrier was anxious!The countless vengeful souls could be considered a spiritual attack. To the demons and chaos beasts, this kind of attack was the most troublesome. They were very strong in terms of their physical bodies.However, when it came to spiritual-ranked killing techniques, they were extremely harmful.Iron Harrier couldn't help it!In the past, there were five brothers of the iron-eating clan who rose to power, just like the current Overlord of the world of five elements. However, Fu Sheng had killed two of them back then. Later, the red moon attacked and killed one. Now, there were only him and his big brother left.The iron-eating realm was also lost.If big brother were to die in battle here ...Wouldn't the iron-eating race have no hope?They had too many enemies, too terrifying. Hong Yue, Fu Sheng, Dragon Lord, they were all grade 8 ...Was he counting on him to take revenge?At this moment, he wanted to make a move. The human King, unlike his usual joking and scolding, turned his head and looked at him with a solemn expression. His eyes were cold as he transmitted a message,""Watch! Wait! When your big brother is about to die, when this guy feels that he's in the bag, when he's at his most relaxed, whether he's relaxed or not, I'll naturally make my move!""But ...""No buts!"The human King was incomparably solemn. He looked at him and transmitted,""You can only listen to me! You can only listen to me! Otherwise...If you go, you'll only be sending yourself to your death. You'll die with your big brother! If you want to follow me and take revenge, what's the big deal with taking some risks? After this, you brothers will get lost. If you want to take revenge, you can do it yourself!"At this moment, the human King was extremely domineering and cold.Where was this?What kind of danger was this?Just wait!When the iron eater was about to run out, or when it was on the verge of death, that would be the chance.If he attacked ... It would be a sure-kill strike!Even if he couldn't kill Fu Sheng in one blow, he would at least wipe out the grade 7 experts around him.……Time slowly passed.The iron-eating Paragon Emperor, who was surrounded, roared madly and waved his iron staff wildly, shattering the sky and earth and crushing countless vengeful souls.The aura of death filled the air.Many of these vengeful souls were at the venerable sovereign level.However, at this moment, it was still shattered by a stick.Venerable sovereign fleeting life was also very distressed. Although these vengeful souls weren't all of his strength, he had spent a lot of energy and paid a huge price to collect them bit by bit. Now, countless of them had been destroyed by this reckless guy. He might not be able to use this move in the future. Fortunately, the iron-eating venerable sovereign was also surrounded by death Qi and his spirit was being attacked. Although he didn't look like he was seriously injured, the mental damage made him go crazy!He smashed his way towards venerable sovereign fleeting life. His peak rank seven aura spread across the world as he roared,"beast, do you dare to fight me face to face?"Venerable monarch fleeting life's face was cold.Why did I have to face you head-on?It would be idiotic to not use any means. He laughed when he saw the iron eater Emperor going crazy. This might be the best outcome. Although the collapse of the vengeful spirit had exhausted him, it was worth it to kill a peak rank seven enemy so easily."Iron eater, kneel down and beg me ..."Fu Sheng provoked him and smiled. The angrier, the crazier, and the more crazy his enemy was, the happier he was."Roar!"His roar reverberated in all directions. The iron cudgel was like a giant pillar that reached the sky, striking madly in all directions. Venerable sovereign Fu Sheng waved his hand gently, and the four great sovereigns also attacked at the same time, shattering all the aftershocks.This little bit of aftershock couldn't hurt them.The seventh rank venerable sovereigns felt more at ease now. They looked around and remained vigilant.With such a huge commotion, they had to be careful of outsiders interfering.……Li Hao continued to watch in silence.Di yang, who was at the side, couldn't hold it in any longer. He transmitted a message,""Xiaochen, are your people not here yet?""Soon ..."Li Hao also sent a voice transmission."Don't worry, senior. Besides ... The situation isn't right now. We might not have the chance to attack. Even if the human King is nearby, he might not dare to attack ..."Di yang was a little depressed.That was true!Fu Sheng, this little thing, was very vigilant.BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the heavens and earth. Di yang looked at the battlefield again. The huge iron eater Emperor was trying to break out of the encirclement but was once again killed by the five experts. Once again, he was surrounded by countless vengeful souls. The vengeful souls were also continuously being destroyed.However, at this moment, it was still boundless.This Fu Sheng had killed many people over the years."The Dao of life and death, you do have some ability ..."At this moment, Supreme Emperor di yang also sighed, but he shook his head and said,""However, there are countless vengeful souls, and their quality is not very high. If I had the ability to kill thousands of venerable sovereigns and surround them with vengeful souls ... A level Seven venerable sovereign would have been killed long ago."Li Hao didn't say anything, only observing.Vengeful souls ...The Dao of life and death was different for everyone. Li Hao's Dao of life and death only had the reincarnation cycle. His other abilities were all mediocre.Lin Hongyu's way of life and death created a hell of death, which could turn the dead into undead guards.'Floating life' actually made use of the vengeful souls of people after death ... In fact, it was the other party's spiritual transformation, turning into something like a dead soul, each with its own characteristics.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Then could this Fu Sheng walk the path of life and death?What about the reincarnation Emperor?Would he be able to survive?He was a little puzzled and could not make a judgment.

Chapter 3387 Three-Sided Attack (3)
If it was possible, it would be terrifying. Who could kill a peak rank eight venerable sovereign nine times? of course, the premise was that after killing the other party once, the other party could resurrect continuously, and each time, he had to prepare enough energy to resurrect a rank eight venerable sovereign.At this moment, venerable monarch fleeting life made his move again.This time, it wasn't a vengeful spirit, but a towering tree. It appeared between heaven and earth, and its branches covered the entire battlefield like a Dao domain. Countless life-force was extracted by the tree! The iron-eating Thearch soared into the sky and broke countless branches, but his body continued to exude vitality."Roar!"A shrill cry was heard once again as the iron eater Thearch charged forward. He was clearly at the peak of the seventh rank, but he felt extremely uncomfortable here. Fu Sheng did not even want to clash with him head-on.In the next moment, a surge of energy and vitality emerged from his body. He was going to fight with his life on the line!The gargantuan body of the demon appeared between the heavens and the earth like a star. It blew up countless vengeful souls from all directions. At this moment, all the vengeful souls exploded!The flesh and blood on the iron-eating creature's body seemed to have melted at this moment, revealing its white bones. With the iron rod in its hand, it smashed the towering tree into pieces!Venerable monarch fleeting life grunted and laughed.The powerful iron-eating Emperor's body had been completely worn out by him, and his qi and blood power had been depleted by more than half. His aura had fallen from the peak of the seventh rank to barely the seventh rank.One could only imagine how much damage the other party had suffered.At that moment, the iron eater Emperor had no way to escape."Kill him!"He didn't want to trap and kill the other party anymore. The longer he waited, the more dreams he would have. Now was the right time.In an instant, the five powerhouses charged at the iron eater Thearch at the same time.At this moment, the void fluctuated as if some experts had appeared. Venerable monarch fleeting life's eyes turned cold as he shouted,""I knew someone was waiting for me!"He raised his hand and smacked out a palm. It was extremely powerful!There was no trace of her pale face from before.The void fluctuated.There was a loud boom!An iron-eating beast fell from the sky, covered in blood and spitting out blood. Death energy surrounded it as it roared,""We'll die together!"An explosive force emerged from his body, showing signs of self-destruction.A seventh level venerable sovereign was about to self-destruct upon meeting him.Venerable sovereign fleeting life was stunned and frowned slightly. Seventh rank?Not level eight?The next moment, his expression changed slightly. A trap ... No, a bait.Damn it!Behind him, the four tier 7 experts were slightly slower. At this moment, a long blade silently appeared. The human King's expression was calm as he slashed at one of the cultivators. This blade seemed to be able to cut through the world.The four seventh level venerable sovereigns seemed to have been instantly enveloped into a vast and boundless universe.This universe seemed to be isolated from chaos, heaven and earth, and the great Dao universe.There was only this blade in the entire world!   Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  The seventh rank venerable sovereign was terrified and shouted,""Kill!"The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns attacked at the same time, but the long saber was faster than them. It was so fast that it seemed to suppress all four of them!The entire world seemed to have turned into a cage.Dao laws started to appear in the world.One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand ...In the sky above the entire universe, all the Dao laws except this saber seemed to have merged into one thing ... It was ... A person!A person who looked exactly like the human King!It wasn't anything else, nor was it a blade, spear, sword, or halberd. It was just a man. The human King had fought countless battles in his life. He only believed that he could solve all dangers.He could only solve any problem by himself.Believe in him?No, it's just that the ultimate Dao can only be himself!Other people's DAOs were the river, weapons, all living things, heaven and earth, the sun, the moon ...He wasn 't!His Dao, the convergence of thousands of DAOs, would eventually converge into his own appearance.What he cultivated was not yin and yang, not life and death, not anything else but himself!"Little shrimp, what are you jumping about for!"A scornful laugh resounded through the heavens and the earth. The blade slashed out. To the outside world, it was a silent slash. However, in the eyes of the four rank seven venerable sovereigns, it was as if the world had collapsed and the heavens and earth had been destroyed. The blade descended ...A Grade 7 expert's soul was destroyed, his great Dao was broken, his body was shattered, his bones disappeared, and his Dao origin was shattered ...The slash was extremely clean and neat!A seventh-level venerable sovereign from a top eighth-level great cosmos had perished silently.……Thearch di yang was shocked!When iron Harrier appeared, he was excited for a moment. He thought it was the human King, but it was struck out by Fu Sheng. He was a little regretful that it wasn't the human King. But who would have thought that in the next moment, he would see the human King attack.One slash, ordinary and unremarkable.However, when the blade landed on a rank seven venerable sovereign, he didn't struggle. He didn't roar. He didn't do anything ... He died.His soul was destroyed!Li Hao was also shocked, and his expression changed slightly.He had once killed long Xuan with a single strike, but it was only his physical body. He had only been cut into two. He still had to kill his Dao source and make another strike. Moreover, it would cause a huge commotion. The others had to create an opportunity for him ...However, today, the human King had struck with his saber and the four rank seven venerable sovereigns had retaliated. One of them had been killed with a single strike, and nothing had happened.It was so quiet that it was as if ... The grade-7 in front of him was just an illusion. He was as light as a feather, and he had disappeared.

Chapter 3388 Three-Sided Attack (3)
At this moment, Fu Sheng had just sent the level 7 iron Harrier flying with one palm. He looked back and was shocked.This was ... The rumored neo martial artist King?Damn it!One blade, without a sound, killed a seventh-rank on the spot. It was simply unbelievable. It was too fast. Even if an eighth-rank could kill a seventh-rank, it couldn't be done so easily ..."Damn it!"Fu Sheng roared and turned around to fight the human King. Behind him, the iron-eating venerable Emperor, who had turned into white bones, roared madly and smashed the sky with his iron staff!It went straight for Fu Sheng!As for the human King, he chuckled with a contemplative look on his face."Killing my brother is the same as killing me. If you dare to provoke my brother ... I'll exterminate your entire family!"Another saber attack!The three tier 7 experts had also regained their senses at this moment. They roared in madness and attacked him one after another. A River of Life and death appeared in the sky and earth, circling the sky and earth. The death Qi covered the entire region.As the human King's Blade descended, it was the same as before. Another blade was struck out ... BOOM! This time, there was an incomparably loud sound. A Grade 7 monster was instantly shattered.As for the human King, his body froze slightly as he gasped for breath.Killing a rank seven with one blade was still a little tiring.It was a pity that he hadn't reached his true peak. With four tier 7 experts blocking him, he had only killed two of them, and he was already tired. How embarrassing.In the past, I killed those weaker than me with a single slash.And now ... He was old.The human King sighed in his heart. He was more than a thousand years old, not young anymore. He had only killed two level 7s, and he was already tired ... How embarrassing.In the next moment, he did not swing his blade again, but instantly appeared between the two living rank-7s.The entire area seemed to have turned into a small cage.The human King chuckled,"this is the art of eternal peace!" Take a good look ... Can you guys do it in a close combat?"Before the two level 7s could come back to their senses, they were still thinking about how to resist the blade ... The other party approached in an instant. In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of fists appeared. At that moment, it was as if the entire world was completely shattered!The human King was like an ancient giant beast as he attacked crazily. Tens of millions of punches rained down at an unbelievable speed. One punch stacked on another. The two tier 7 experts wanted to retreat, but there was no way to do so. They couldn't retreat at all!At this moment, they finally revealed their fear.How did this happen?What was this?Four seventh-rank fighters could fight eighth-rank fighters, but in front of this eighth-rank fighter, this human king who was said to have just advanced to the eighth-rank, two of them were killed instantly. In the blink of an eye, the two of them seemed to see the meat paste beside them. The meat paste turned into fine powder, and the fine powder disappeared with the wind ...Those were their physical bodies. In the blink of an eye, two tier 7 physical bodies were completely crushed into dust. The blades of human Kings were very famous, but not many people knew about the close combat of human Kings.Today, someone found out.This was because those who knew about it would usually be dead. Therefore, the human King was very regretful. His close combat techniques, the art of infinite immortality or the art of infinite Masters, were almost lost and no one knew about them.What a pity!BOOM!With a loud explosion, heaven and earth shattered, and the surrounding chaotic force exploded. The two tier 7 experts were completely annihilated!In the blink of an eye, the four tier 7 experts were killed by the human King!In the dark.Di Yang's mouth was wide open and his eyes were filled with shock!So strong!He could kill a level Seven, but if there were two of them ... He would have to pay a price and spend a lot of time to kill them. Three ... That would be difficult. Killing even one would be troublesome. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Four of them ... Then let's just force ourselves to fight. It would be difficult to even win, let alone kill anyone.To kill four seventh level venerable sovereigns in the blink of an eye, unless he joined forces with his brother, and they had to pay a high price, there was a high chance of success.However, at this moment ... The human King was only one person.Was this still a cultivator who had just advanced to the eighth step?Li Hao's eyes flickered. He estimated that he had at least 5000 rays of power. The power of a human King was beyond his imagination. He had thought that he was already very strong at the seventh level of the human King realm, and that he would probably not be weak at the eighth level.He had at least 4000 traces of power, but it seemed that he had still underestimated him. This person had at least 5000 traces of power.Even if he was weaker than the Dragon race, how many years had it been since the Dragon Lord entered peak tier 8?The human King was only a thousand years old.……"That's impossible ..."Fu Sheng roared in shock and disbelief. Four level 7 experts were killed in an instant!At this moment, he wanted to escape.However, in the next moment, he managed to calm himself down. The face of the human King not far away was flushed red as he breathed in and out crazily. Even a human King wouldn't be able to take on four rank 7s in an instant. At this moment, he wasn't putting on an act, although human Kings liked to put on an act.At this moment, the human King's breathing was extremely heavy. He bared his teeth and laughed. "I'm old, but it's still okay. I'm still ... Fit and strong!"I can still kill a tier 7."You ..."Fu Sheng's expression changed slightly and he said nothing more. At this moment, he sensed something and his eyes lit up. The next moment, he struck out a palm towards the human King.Many people were actually paying attention to this battle.Even though they were far away, there were still people paying attention.Even in the Samsara realm, there were experts who had been paying attention. However, no one expected the power of a human King to be beyond imagination. In an instant, he killed four rank seven experts. At this moment, the power of the great Dao of Samsara even began to spread.

Chapter 3389 Three-Sided Attack (3)
There was an expert who wanted to descend here!The master of Samsara?Fu Sheng thought to himself, but he quickly determined that it was probably not. It should be the other two uncles, the Samsara Emperor, who had been in seclusion recently. They were really in seclusion and were not pretending. There was no need to pretend.Furthermore, such a top-notch existence would rarely leave their homeland, or else the danger would increase greatly.Although they were not the Masters of the great Dao, the two level-eight cultivators had some special authority in the great Dao universe. At this moment, they felt the danger of Fu Sheng and the death of four level-seven cultivators, and they could not care about anything else.He immediately began to locate Fu Sheng's position and teleported through the top great Dao universe to arrive here!It was because of this that Fu Sheng chose to stay.As for the human King, he had also sensed something. He cursed in his heart for a while, but he wasn't afraid. Even if the master of Samsara were to descend, he could just run away at the worst. Now, it seemed that it might not be the case. He still needed a little speed and time ...Unfortunately, there was a high chance that he wouldn't have enough time to kill this level 8.Unlucky!The speed was really fast, even faster than expected.However, it was enough to kill four rank Sevens for now.The human King was already preparing to retreat!……In the dark. Supreme Emperor di yang also sensed it and frowned slightly. So fast, has the reincarnation realm gone crazy? a few rank eights came and went as they pleased. It seems that they attached great importance to Fu Sheng. Are they not afraid of any traps?If he really fell, it wouldn't just be the end of a grade 8.He was really bold!On the human King's side, the other people from neo martial had not appeared yet.If it really did appear ... Could it be that reincarnation would personally descend?Li Hao also frowned slightly. The great path of the universe was fluctuating, and the world was shaking. It seemed that an expert was coming. However, Li Hao did not stop at this moment. Instead, he took advantage of the fluctuation to send a message.At this moment, the Dao chess piece far behind also fluctuated its own universe. Dao chess had the ability to teleport, but the fluctuation was not small.Normally, they would not teleport away.But now, since the universe of the great path of reincarnation was fluctuating violently, no one would care if there were more fluctuations.Li Hao was not afraid! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  As long as he killed di yang and the others, even if the Samsara realm experts arrived, they could just meet up with the human Kings. They could escape, kill, or fight ... They still had a chance.What was there to be afraid of?Moreover, the human King had killed four tier 7 experts in an instant ... To be honest, Li Hao felt pressured, but he also felt ... Impulsive!If a human King could kill four tier 7 experts in an instant, could he?What a joke.Let alone four, even one would be difficult. As for the eighth level of human King, I'm only at the sixth level ... Human Kings have only just entered the eighth level, and I can be considered a seventh level. In fact, the difference is only one level ...He could kill four of them in an instant ...Li Hao gritted his teeth, and a spatial fluctuation appeared behind him. At first, Supreme Emperor earth yang thought that it was a fluctuation from the Samsara universe, but the next moment, he felt that something was wrong.What was it?There seemed to be the aura of an expert ... "My people seem to have arrived ..." Li Hao said just as he was thinking.Your people?Just as this thought appeared in his mind, his expression changed.The four level Seven venerable sovereigns beside him didn't feel anything. At this moment, Li Hao didn't hide anything. The thousand-world sword that he had prepared long ago struck out instantly!He went straight for a rank seven earth yang Supreme Emperor, who was not rank eight.He couldn't kill a stage eight expert with one strike. Even if this stage eight expert had left his homeland, he still couldn't kill him with one strike. As for a stage seven expert, if he caught him off guard, he still had a great chance.The sword slashed out, and the sword intent burst out!Sword Saint?Neo martial?This was di Yang's first thought. In the next moment, the Wushan Supreme Emperor struck out with his palm. A familiar aura burst out, which made di yang instantly furious. Wushan, it's really a neo martial ... No, other than Wushan, the others 'auras are different?What was going on?As soon as this thought emerged in his mind, a loud boom was heard. The long sword split the sky and earth. Under the sword, a seventh rank venerable sovereign who was completely unprepared was killed on the spot!Li Hao's face also flushed.It instantly returned to its original state."You are ..."Di yang was furious!This was ... The Silver Moon King?Although he had never seen it before, he knew a thing or two. Damn it, bastard!How did he disguise himself as Xiao Chen?Li Hao, on the other hand, ignored him and looked behind him. The human King was also looking in his direction at this moment. After exchanging a glance, the human King suddenly smiled. Little guy, are you trying to prove yourself to me?Or could it be that the Silver Moon King wasn't any weaker than the human King?You're at the eighth step, so I'll kill a seventh step as well?In an instant, Kong Ji, er Mao, Wu Shan, and Dao Qi attacked at the same time. Together with Li Hao, the five experts exploded. Li Hao killed one with a single strike, while Kong Ji, er Mao, and Dao Qi worked together to kill a tier 7 expert in one blow!Wu Shan had stopped di yang, so the remaining three seventh rank venerable sovereigns were still in a daze.In an instant, six godly fists erupted, far more powerful than before.BOOM!The fist of the six paths covered the sky and the earth. The two cats swallowed the sky and the earth, cutting off the force of the summoning. The chess pieces covered the entire area, dragging the other two rank seven venerable sovereigns into space.BOOM!Another seventh rank venerable sovereign was smashed into pieces by the fist of six paths."Bastard ..."Thearch di yang roared madly and angrily.Bastard!I've been tricked!However, Li Hao's group was too fast, so fast that it was inconceivable. This sudden attack caught venerable earth Yang by surprise. One second ago, he had been planning to take over the human King's position, but in the next second, he had turned into the Silver Moon King.
