Did the top powerhouse of new martial arts also leave with the master of Tian Fang back then?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.The Dragon Master took a deep breath. Be it Tian Fang or the primal Chaos, they were both filled with secrets that he didn't know about. Now, a ninth stage venerable sovereign had emerged in the primal Chaos outer domain and swept through the primal Chaos!This was only what he had shown. Was there really only one true ninth-rank?Just as he was thinking, he suddenly frowned.He looked out. This look seemed to see through heaven and earth. In the distance, there seemed to be a world that was sinking, avoiding the Path of the Dragon world.He didn't know who it was, but it was probably the so-called Black Dog world.From the outside, it was a rank 6 world.It was a reward from the fire Phoenix.There were many worlds like this, and he usually didn't care too much about it.What caught his attention was not this, not even the trembling Black Dog ...These were not the targets that he was concerned about.What he was concerned about was ... That there seemed to be another great Dao power in the chaos. It was not the power of the Dragon Realm, the power of Chaos, or the power of the fire Phoenix.It was ... A power that could not be seen, could not be touched, but seemed to really exist.That was strange.The look in the Dragon Master's eyes changed gradually. In his eyes, it was as if heaven and earth in all four directions had appeared. The next moment, he disappeared into thin air.……Li Hao was currently avoiding the dragon world.He was also a little nervous.They really did pass through me. How terrifying. Four tier 7 Dragons carrying the world on their backs flying. What a Grand display. I can't wait for the whole world to know that the dragon world has set off!Of course, he felt that a small figure like him would not attract anyone's attention.But the next moment, Li Hao's heart almost stopped beating.The last time he had met Red Moon master, he had not been this worried. But at this moment, he felt uneasy and heavy. How could this be?Why would an eighth-rank figure care about a small foreign world?Even if this place was the enemy's territory.But ... Would an eighth level figure have the time to care about a fifth level venerable sovereign?He pretended not to notice ...In the next moment, he could no longer pretend. He suddenly raised his head as if he had just seen it. His eyes were instantly filled with fear, uneasiness, and uneasiness ... please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Dragon Lord didn't look at him, but looked around. After a while, he looked at the Black Panther Li Hao had possessed and said indifferently,""You know me?""I ... I don't know ... But I know at a glance ... Greetings, Dragon Lord ...""No need to be so polite!" The Dragon Master did not say much and was just a little puzzled. He opened his mouth and said,""You came from the fire Phoenix realm. Has anything happened in the fire Phoenix realm recently?""The ..."Li Hao was puzzled. Not to capture me?He was a little puzzled and shook his dog head.""I don't think so ... No, I think so. Supreme Emperor Feng Shan said that the local Supreme emperors of the fire Phoenix realm are going back for closed-door cultivation ... Could it be that the realm Lord has advanced to level eight?"Bullshit!The Dragon Master didn't ask any more questions. His eyes continued to sweep the surroundings, and he frowned again.That was impossible!"I seem to sense a weak special power nearby. It seems ... Like it's called the bed universe, but it doesn't feel like it.That's strange!He didn't know, and neither did Li Hao. In fact, this was a change brought about by Li Hao's river of time. As the Silver Moon Emperor scattered, he took away some small realms and formed a large net. Gradually, some illusory power of time began to spread.Fortunately, Li Hao didn't leave the space-time star here, so only some energy spread.It was faintly discernible and did not condense into a single spot.The Dragon Lord continued to sweep his surroundings. Gradually, he looked into the distance, and the direction of his gaze ... Was precisely the region where the rat world was located. The Dragon Lord was a little puzzled. Was it over there?Close to the tianfang region?He looked over there, while Li Hao carefully stole a glance at the Dragon Lord ... The next moment, his heart trembled!Was this looking at the heavens or the little world that director Zhao left behind?It can't be!The distance was extremely far!Not only that, there was nothing there that could attract the Dragon Lord's attention ... No, time star!In an instant, Li Hao seemed to have guessed something. At this moment, he didn't move or dare to make a sound, but he was shocked. How could this be? it was actually very difficult to detect the power of time.Time was everywhere!Did the time star attract the Dragon Lord's attention?'Or did I misunderstand? he's just looking at the sky region ...',m At this moment, the Dragon Lord no longer said anything. He lowered his head and looked down at Li Hao. He was extremely calm, and his voice didn't seem so majestic anymore. In fact, it even sounded a little gentle. "It's fine. I'm tired of staying in the dragon world, so I came out to take a look. I heard that you're the newly appointed Lord of the Fire Phoenix World. Not bad, cultivate well and strive to reach the sixth rank as soon as possible. After the sixth rank, you'll conquer a seventh rank world and have a chance of reaching the seventh rank!""Many thanks for your guidance, Dragon Lord!""I didn't give you any pointers. The key to cultivation is sincerity. Blindly devouring the world is not the way of the king. The key is to comprehend the Dao!"The Dragon Lord seemed to have some thoughts and said with a faint smile,""Devouring the world is just a process of laying the foundation. If one's Dao is not strong enough, even if one reaches Level 7, it's nothing! The chaos race has a natural advantage when it comes to Dao enlightenment. The Dao of chaos isn't inferior to the Dao of a world, only stronger. The Dao of chaos is a bit more chaotic, but it's also more comprehensive ..."He said a few words casually and looked at the Black Panther. Without saying anything else, he disappeared into thin air.As a rank 8 master, he had no intention of forcefully spying on a medium-sized world.

Chapter 3191 Tacit Understanding (1)
Furthermore, the changes that they had sensed did not come from here. The moment they entered the dragon world, their voices reverberated in the ears of the tier 7 Dragons."Speed up. Head to the tianfang region quickly and stop at the border for a while!"The four giant Dragons instantly exploded without a word. The huge Dragon World passed through in an instant, bringing with it a huge wave of chaos.As for the Dragon Lord, he silently sensed that faint energy.It seemed to have spread throughout the entire area. It was very weak in other places, but ... Near the border between the heaven and Dragon field, there seemed to be ... A ball of light!What kind of energy was this?The Dragon Lord was puzzled. In the past, he didn't seem to have noticed it.​ At that moment, he couldn't be bothered to continue walking slowly, nor was he interested in going to the fire Phoenix realm to take a look. Previously, he had planned on going there to have a look and communicate with the fire Phoenix, explaining some things.But now, that energy had piqued his interest.……The dragon world quickly disappeared.Li Hao, on the other hand, watched silently. Seeing that his opponent's speed was at least ten times faster than before, he frowned.The Dragon Lord suddenly appeared and then ... Left in an instant.I'm handsome?Handsome, he was still a Black Panther.It shouldn't have anything to do with me. Otherwise, he would have killed me with a single punch. Why did he suddenly appear here and then ... Leave so quickly? his speed was much faster than before.He was no longer moving slowly."Time star?"Li Hao's expression turned grave. It couldn't be.He had used it before in front of Level Seven and level eight, but no one cared. Why ... Could it be that the time and star had left him, causing some fluctuations? because he was forging the river, the power had leaked?At this moment, he was a little uneasy.Although it might not be what he had guessed, if it was really going after Time and Stars, then it would be a big problem."The time star was left in the rat world, director Zhao was still there, and the King and Queen of Dali were still there, continuing to gather all the humans ...Li Hao took a deep breath. Perhaps it was time for them to retreat.No matter what, it was better to be careful.Also, the Dragon Lord was a little terrifying.The other party could actually sense the power of time ... That was a little unusual.When the dragon world was far away, he quickly entered the Silver Moon.At this moment, two cats and great destruction were inside the Silver Moon, frantically suppressing the great path universe to prevent others from discovering their fluctuations. Li Hao took a deep breath and instantly appeared in front of two cats."Senior ermao, can a type 8 powerhouse sense the existence of time and space?" Second cat was confused and shook his head after a while."I don't know," please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao was speechless."Just now ... The Dragon Lord suddenly appeared here for a moment and then disappeared. The dragon world accelerated towards the sky. Do you think it could have sensed the Time and Stars?"Second cat thought for a moment and nodded,"it's possible!" Time and star ... After all, it's only an embryonic form and still very young. It's not very powerful by itself ... You're also connected to many Ethereal Plane, causing some energy to overflow ... However, if the other party can sense it, it means that the other party is very sensitive to the great Dao and has even comprehended many DAOs because time and star have many, many DAOs ..."A rank nine venerable sovereign usually needed to comprehend many great DAOs to weave a Dao net. For example, the master of Tian Fang had comprehended 9999 DAOs.Such an existence was terrifyingly powerful. Any change in the great Dao would attract the attention of the other party.Time and Stars were also the convergence of thousands of DAOs.Those who didn't have a deep understanding of the Dao wouldn't be able to sense anything, but those who had a deep understanding of the Dao might be able to sense some of the changes in time and space.Li Hao's expression changed."It's not convenient to activate the river of time now. Otherwise, I'm worried that the other party will sense us. It'll be difficult to inform director Zhao ..."He furrowed his brows. In terms of speed, he was definitely not as fast as his opponent.How could he inform director Zhao?It was better to be safe than sorry.What if ... He was really sensed?Li Hao had not expected this. He had thought that no one would notice.Second cat saw that he was worried and thought about it,"You think that the Dragon Lord might have really discovered it? "If that's the case, then the other party is too strong. I suspect that he's even at the peak of rank eight and has comprehended more than 5000 great DAOs. He might even be weaving a net of 10000 DAOs!"Otherwise, it would not be so easy to sense the fluctuations of time."Now, if the enemy is heading in that direction, there's only one way ..."Li Hao looked at it. Second cat, perhaps you know more about Time and Stars than me."Time is everywhere, but the past and the present are the only things!"Li Hao fell into deep thought."So, there can only be one time star ... It's in the world of rats now. If it disappears, it's gone. It doesn't exist in the world of rats anymore!""Senior, you mean ..." Li Hao raised his eyebrows."Try to enter a certain moment in the past and take away the time star. This way, the current time star will also disappear from its original place!"Li Hao raised his eyebrows.Is this a joke?"It should work!""At least, this is the only time star!" Now that the other party has sensed it, I can only take back Silvermoon's great Dao universe. The time star was here to begin with, so I can hide better by entering the great Dao universe ..."

Chapter 3192 Tacit Understanding (Part 7)
Li Hao considered for a moment."But I don't have time and Stars now. How can I immerse myself in the past?""You're the master of the time star. Even without the time star, you should be able to immerse yourself in it ... You just haven't tried it! Your Dao should have already intertwined with time, and it's very difficult to distinguish it clearly!"Li Hao thought for a while and nodded. He would give it a try.If it really didn't work ... It didn't mean that there was no way.It all depended on who was faster.For example, now, he could activate the chess mark and let the chess piece come out from tianfang. He could quickly head there and take away the time star. Or he could activate Lin Hongyu's life star and death Star and directly injure her. Perhaps Lin Hongyu could understand ... Anyway, communication in the chaos was really troublesome.Li Hao was also helpless.At this moment, he didn't say anything more. He quickly tried to immerse himself in it. At this moment, there were thousands of thoughts in his mind. The Dragon Lord might be ... Stronger than all the other tier 8 experts. This was the terrifying part.……After trying for a while, Li Hao gradually had some feelings.A moment later, the power of time seemed to appear in his eyes. At this moment, he did not dare to go out. He hid in the Silvermoon great path universe.Gradually, he began to immerse himself in the past.This time, he didn't need to go anywhere else. He just needed to stay here, because Time and Stars were already in the universe of the great path.After a long time, Li Hao opened his eyes.It was as if they had really returned to the past. The universe of the great path was extremely weak and small. It was as if they had returned to the time when the stars and time first met.Everything was frozen!Li Hao's figure was also faintly visible.According to second cat, there was only one time star. The time star that he was looking at now was actually the same one in the rat world. However, it was projected in two places, one in the present and one in the past.At this moment, he felt that the Dao of time was extremely complicated. How could Zhan Tiandi form such a great Dao origin? What a terrifying character!Not daring to waste any time, Li Hao instantly condensed his figure and grabbed at the time star!The power of time also appeared in his hands.The time star seemed to have met Li Hao for the first time. It resisted and tried to escape, but Li Hao grabbed it as if he had grabbed something solid.Li Hao's heart trembled. Could it really work?When one was immersed in it, it was often just an illusion!But now, it seemed that they had really caught the real thing.……At the same time.The world of rats.Director Zhao was stunned. He looked up at the sky. A star was originally floating there, but at this moment, it was as if an invisible hand had appeared ... The next moment, the time star was ... Gone!He was stunned!How was that possible?It's finished! This was Li Hao's origin of great Dao. Had it been stolen?'This ... This is impossible!If even this thing was stolen ... Did that mean that Li Hao was killed?The next moment, King Dali and the Queen flew over and looked up at the sky. They were all stunned. Not only that, as the stars of time disappeared, even the river of time disappeared. The little realm that was still absorbing energy suddenly trembled.The ethereal extent that enveloped the rat world suddenly trembled violently, and then ... It suddenly shattered like a dream!The three of them were shocked!How could this be?Director Zhao frowned. This change was unexpected. He was worried that something had happened to Li Hao. At this moment, the Queen suddenly said,""He took it himself, right?""What?"Director Zhao looked at her and the Queen explained,""Other than him, who else can take it? If he was really a top-notch expert ... Would he still need to steal? Just take it away and kill us! He took away Time and Stars, causing the ethereal extent to shake and shatter. Now, even the power of belief is overflowing ... If that's the case, we can't hide this place anymore!""This ..." Zhang xuan frowned."We've been carrying out a secret operation all this time, but we're taking this with us now. Either we're in danger, or we're being told that we can't hide this place anymore ..."Director Zhao came back to his senses and nodded,""Not bad! Maybe ... Something has happened. Let's go!"As he said this, he looked at the countless humans in the little realm. At this moment, their faith had already gathered. But now ... What should he do?He had been exposed!It could no longer be concealed!Even though it was only a stage one World, it would still be very troublesome for them to take it away. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Abandoned?Or what?He looked at the Dali King and then at the Queen."Let's go ... These people, are you still going to take them away?"The Queen frowned and was silent for a moment.Take him away?There were too many!Not easy to lead.Unless ...At this moment, she glanced at the king of Dali, suddenly exhaled, and laughed,""It wasn't easy to gather some faith, and I can't bear to throw it away ... How about this, you might have forgotten that I'm ... Silver Moon!"The two of them were stunned. What did he mean?The next moment, the Queen laughed,"the Silver Moon is a world of its own, and also the will of the heavens. It is also the first God of the Silver Moon!" And I am the substitute of that God. Of course, now, I am the original body!""I will prove my Dao with faith and form the Silver Moon Divine Empire!""A divine Kingdom is like a world, but it isn 't. It's a Kingdom of my faith ... I can let these people enter and continue to provide me with faith, and I can take them away at any time!"At this moment, she seemed to have made a decision. She would no longer wait.Just as the two of them were still in shock, she suddenly transformed into a Silver Moon. She was incomparably huge and shone brightly in the sky. In an instant, the Queen's voice reverberated through the sky and earth!

"Those who believe in me, enter my God nation!""This world is filthy. Follow me to my God nation and become my people ... I am a heavenly God, and my God nation will last forever. Prove my God Dao and prove the god of chaos with me!"In an instant, the world seemed to collapse.Below, countless humans were fanatical. It was as if a divine Kingdom had appeared before their eyes. It was huge, with brilliant flowers and countless palaces. It was like a world of paradise.At this moment, countless people unconsciously took a step forward. In an instant, they seemed to have stepped into a divine Kingdom!The king of Dali took a deep breath and looked at the Queen. He then sent a message to director Zhao,""This woman ... She's not simple. Old Zhao, be careful. She's actually building a kingdom of faith here ... If this is not handled properly, she might really become the chaos 'will one day ..."Eh?Director Zhao was shocked. Was that possible?He didn't know much about the path of faith, but at this moment, he was already in disbelief. Could it be that someone could really become the chaos 'will?Did the chaos have the will of the heavens?He didn't understand, but the Queen's aura instantly skyrocketed. In the blink of an eye, she became a venerable sovereign, and countless humans entered the divine Kingdom.With just a thought, they could enter the divine Kingdom. The prerequisite was that they had faith.And most people believed in it.Soon, the entire little realm seemed to be empty. The Queen suddenly turned into a Silver Moon and devoured the entire little realm. Before the other two could react, she had engulfed them and disappeared without a trace!Until they left.The dragon world, which was at Li Hao's side not long ago, suddenly appeared here. As soon as the Dragon Lord appeared, his expression changed slightly, and he snorted coldly."The power of faith? Someone dares to prove his belief in the God in the Dragon field!"He frowned. Was that the power of faith that he had sensed earlier?It didn't look like it!But ... He followed his senses and felt an extremely dense power of faith!There was someone here who had proven his way and become an Emperor. The key was that it was a very special God of belief. He had seen some venerable sovereigns who had proven their way, but ... They seemed a little different.What was different? He sensed for a while and his expression changed. This ... Didn't seem to be a pure belief. He raised his head and looked at the primal Chaos void, frowning.Did he meet a lunatic or a psychopath?The other party ... Seemed to have relied on the primal Chaos void to vindicate his Dao as a God of faith. He did not know what was so special about him. He only knew that this madman might be completely devoured by the primal Chaos!The great Dao all had to have a place to rely on. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  That person just now, perhaps ... He had completely relied on his great Dao into the chaos, and was even more of a Chaos Beast than a Chaos Beast!"Strange ..."The Dragon Master looked into the distance and didn't continue to pursue. The other party should have escaped. He was a little shocked. The other party knew that he was coming?He was extremely fast! However, the other party had proven his Dao and arrived instantly. If he had not only told the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns, he would have suspected that someone had betrayed him!He had only mentioned it to the four rank seven venerable sovereigns and rushed over to stop for a while ... And the other party had already run away.What a coincidence!He glanced at the four dragons and quickly suppressed his emotions. Impossible. These four were the foundation of the Dragon race. It was impossible for them to betray me. It was also too late.It could only be said that it was indeed a coincidence.Or could it be that the power of faith was special and could sense danger?Later on, he could capture a few people who had proven their Dao with faith and ask them.He put the guy who had escaped aside and looked around. It was at the edge of the Dragon field, but one of its worlds had been swallowed, so it was still a little provocative. He quickly said,""Send a message to all sides. Find a venerable sovereign who has proven his Dao with his faith. If you see him ... Capture him alive!"He would think about the rest later. He was already leaving the Dragon field, so he didn't have time to find that guy.The God of faith ... It seems that he has his eyes on the countless humans in the Dragon field!Clearly, a human had proven his Dao.

Chapter 3194 Everyone Has Their Troubles (1)
At the edge of the Dragon field.A rank one small world was devoured by someone. Furthermore, the person relied on chaos and faith to vindicate Dao.If it was any other day, the Dragon Lord would still be a little interested in this kind of power of faith that could attract his attention. It seemed like it would not be a bad idea to capture it and study it.However, he had a more important mission at the moment.And ... He had sensed something.Someone was coming!The Dragon Master ordered the people of the Dragon field to catch them. He didn't care about this side anymore. He quickly brought the four venerable sovereigns, controlled the dragon world, crossed the boundary barrier, and entered the tianfang region.……Tianfang region.The two eighth level venerable sovereigns had come to welcome him personally. It could be said that they had given him the most face.The clouds and the red moon!The moment the dragon world appeared, the two level eight venerable sovereigns looked at each other and smiled.The Dragon Lord had arrived!As a result, all of the tier 8 experts would participate in the battle, so there was no need to worry about any tier 8 experts taking advantage of the situation.Otherwise, if the Dragon Lord did not come, it would be very difficult for the Great War to erupt completely."Dragon Lord!""Welcome!"The two eighth level venerable sovereigns arrived together. Yunxiao laughed and said in a clear voice,""I thought it would take some time, but I didn't expect the Dragon Lord to come so quickly. You're indeed the Overlord of the Dragon field! You're also so decisive in your actions. "The Dragon Lord smiled but did not say anything.If he had not sensed a different aura earlier, he would not have arrived so quickly.Take it slow, what's the rush?At that moment, he smiled when he saw the two venerable sovereigns acting so lovey-dovey. They looked like they were in the same boat, but he didn't know what they were thinking.Everyone in the world knew that these two would fall out sooner or later.Of course, he would not be like that now.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "I'm not late, am I?""It's not too late!""However, it'll be too late if I come any later!" Thearch Yunxiao laughed. "Recently, tianfang has shown signs of recovery. Our idea is to take down new martial first and then divide tianfang. At that time, we'll see what everyone can do ... Otherwise, if tianfang recovers first, it won't be easy to deal with once new martial takes advantage of it!""Is Tian Fang really going to revive?""Soon!"The cloud Master did not hide anything. It would be soon, including the great Dao stars that he had obtained. Recently, they had been shining. He had thought that it would take some time, but now it seemed that it would not be too long before the tianfang universe would be completely restored.In that case ... He had to solve the problem of neo martial first. Although neo martial was only a level Seven world, the more he got to this point, the more he felt that the other party was difficult to deal with. It was fine if they were difficult to deal with, but everyone used to live in peace in level eight worlds, so it didn't matter.​ However, this group of bastards from neo martial massacred everywhere. Most importantly, they were specifically targeting the great world!In the past, everyone had devoured worlds too, but they were all small and medium-sized worlds.Who would pay special attention to a level Seven or eight world?Killing the weak, everyone was killing, and there was a tacit understanding between them. It was natural to swallow the weak and the strong. The chaos was the law of the jungle, but today, someone had broken this unspoken rule.If he dared to offend his superior today and devour the Crimson Moon, he would be in the clouds tomorrow!This kind of rule-breaking fellow, whether there was enmity or not, he had to be dealt with!The Dragon Master did not say much and nodded slightly.""Tian Fang is about to recover ... I should get rid of him before that ...""I just stayed in the dragon world for a while," Red Moon master suddenly said."Did you see something interesting, Dragon Master?""It's nothing. A new emperor has just been born ..."It wasn't a big deal. Furthermore, it was the human race that vindicated Dao, so he didn't want to say much.After all, they were both humans.At their level, especially Hong Yue and the others, they didn't care about race at all. They only cared about strength because the human race was the Overlord.Red Moon master, however, was looking for trouble.""New emperor? Becoming a monarch through faith?"The Dragon Master frowned slightly.Why was this guy so concerned?"The world where the little mouse is, right?" Red Moon master asked."Daoist Red Moon, why are you so concerned about a small world?"The Dragon Master smiled, but Red Moon master did not have the intention to mention it. At this moment, she said hesitantly,""The Dragon Lord didn't pay attention to it before, so I didn't pay much attention to it. I saw the Dragon Lord lingering over there, and I was also attracted once before ..."The Dragon Lord was stunned.The next moment, he seemed to have realized something. He looked at Red Moon Emperor and his eyes moved slightly.Could it be ... That this fellow had also sensed that special power?He could sense it, but he also knew that the special fluctuation was very mysterious. Under normal circumstances, it would be difficult to sense it if one did not have enough great Dao Comprehension. Could it be that Hong Yue was hiding her strength?At this moment, the Dragon Lord did not think about anything else. A rank eight venerable sovereign could be attracted by a rank One World.Other than that special fluctuation, what else could it be?Red Moon master, on the other hand, did not think about this. He had been attracted by it because he had felt some power of desire. He had not felt the power of time at all. The two of them were not on the same point.However, the two of them were indeed attracted.For a rank One World to attract the attention of two rank eights, it was obvious that there were problems.At this moment, the Dragon Master smiled."It seems that brother Hongyue also felt that something was amiss ... I felt the same way. However, the other party had escaped in advance and sensed that the two of you were waiting for me here. I couldn't let you two wait for too long, so I didn't care anymore and came here."

Chapter 3195 Everyone Has Their Own Troubles (2)
Red Moon master nodded, then said,""I'm now suspecting ... Whether it's related to Silvermoon's side?"Silver Moon?What did this have to do with Silver Moon?The red moon Lord could not help but think this way at this moment because he had felt some power of desire. Back then, he had been affected by the stench and did not have the mood to think much about it. Now that he saw that the Dragon Master was also attracted to it, he naturally thought back for a moment, and felt that ... He might have been fooled.That place was probably where the Silver Moon King had stayed before!,m That damned guy!If that was the case, he would have missed the best chance to kill him. It was such a pity."Silver Moon?""That's right, Silver Moon!""Last time, the Silver Moon King took advantage of my absence to attack the Crimson Moon world with venerable the sword and the others," the red moon master said."I suspect they'll do the same this time. Now that the dragon world has left ... Although there's no dragon World, there are still many rank Seven Worlds in the Dragon field. I think the Dragon Lord can't be careless. It's best to leave a rank seven venerable sovereign behind to hunt them down. Or maybe the two of you ...""Thank you for your advice, brother Hongyue," the Dragon Master replied with a smile.It was a good suggestion. Of course, there were also many selfish reasons. This was because he had brought four rank-7s with him. Red Moon did not have any rank-7s, and cloudsky only had two rank-7s. With four rank-7s joining forces and an eighth-rank great world ... It could be said that he could even fight them one on two!Now that he had asked him to keep the two of them behind, it was said that it was just in case. He wanted to kill the Silver Moon King for revenge, but he also wanted to weaken his strength.Silver Moon King?  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ I know that you were ambushed, but the Silver Moon King didn't have any seventh level beasts with him this time. You might not know this, but in the Dragon field, the other 11 seventh level beasts are all one!Do you understand?They were one!His Dragon field was not the red moon field that was full of loopholes.Of course, it was still necessary to be careful. The Silver Moon King and Kong Ji had joined forces. After all, they had killed a seventh level venerable sovereign before. Was the person who had just escaped Silver moon's men?The Dragon Lord was not too sure, but he still said,""It's fine if it's a seventh-rank beast ... Dealing with the new martial artists is more important. However, I'll issue a kill order to the Dragon field to hunt down the Silver Moon King and the others! It's still difficult for human cultivators to sneak into the dragon field ...""Fellow Daoist Red Moon, your understanding of the great Dao is not shallow. It seems that even without the world to rely on, you are still extraordinary ... Congratulations!"“……”What the hell?The red moon Emperor was speechless. I asked you to kill the Silver Moon King, and you're here to congratulate me?Are you mocking me?What's going on?For a moment, he couldn't figure out what this guy was thinking. He raised his eyebrows slightly and didn't say anything.On the other hand, venerable sovereign cloud's thoughts were wavering.What did that mean?Just as they were talking about Silvermoon, why did the Dragon Lord suddenly congratulate Redmoon?Strange!The Dragon Lord thought that since the red moon Lord was able to sense that special fluctuation, there was a high chance that he was hiding a lot of his strength. Everyone knew each other. If I could sense it, and so could you, then you and I ... Should both be at the peak of the eighth rank!He had to be more careful with this person. He couldn't be underestimated!Before this, he really couldn't tell and even thought that this person was a bit of a waste. Now, he couldn't help but think more. Was the Crimson Moon world really broken into by accident?It wasn't that ... He was doing this on purpose!At this level, he was free from the restrictions of the world. So what if he lost the great path universe? this person should be weaving his own great path domain, right?If that was the case ... It would be even more terrifying!In fact, the Dragon Master sometimes had such thoughts. The current Dao universe was, after all, an external one and not one he had constructed. In fact, he felt that if he wanted to enter level nine, he might have to break away from the Dao universe. At least, he had to break away from outsiders.If he wanted to construct it, he had to construct it himself.Perhaps, this was the true path to step into the ninth step.If the red moon master did it on purpose ... Then this person was a little terrifying. He might even be more decisive than him, giving up as he wished.Smart people always thought more.But he couldn't stop himself from thinking about it!Yunxiao didn't seem to feel anything at all, but it didn't seem to be the first time Hong Yue had noticed it. Could it be that she had sensed it a long time ago?In addition, was what he had sensed earlier really the power of faith?Why was it different from the faith he had felt before?A Silver Moon person?What kind of energy was it that made him feel a little difficult to figure out?Also, what level had Hong Yue reached?10,000 DAOs return to one ... How many DAOs return to one level had this person reached?Four thousand, five thousand, or six thousand ...At this moment, Dragon Master only looked at Red Moon Emperor silently. He ignored Yun Xiao who was beside him. A person who could not sense that special power was not worthy of his attention, even if the other party was also at the eighth rank!It was still not worth it for a guy with a Dao universe.Of course, the other party might be playing dumb. The venerable sovereigns of the human race were all very cunning.Red Moon sovereign was also playing dumb.But since you've already mentioned it, and everyone knows it, is there a need to play dumb?At this moment, venerable Emperor Red Moon was thinking hard. What was this guy trying to do?We don't have any grudges, right?You suddenly congratulated me, wasn't this asking Yunxiao to be on guard against me?On purpose?As expected, these beasts of primordial chaos weren't anything good!He put on a fake smile."There's no need for congratulations. We'll be able to breathe a sigh of relief when we win the new martial arts!""As for new martial arts, if brother Hongyue is willing to contribute, it's only a matter of time before we take down the other party!"The Dragon Lord smiled faintly. 'We both know each other. If we really work together, be it the human King or Emperor Cang, it'll be easy for us to deal with one each, right?'

Chapter 3196 Everyone Has Their Troubles (3)
“……”F * ck!Red Moon sovereign felt that this guy was targeting him. Who didn't help?He was a little speechless. He was the one who had roped in the other party, and now this fellow was treating him with such an attitude. He was a little confused. Did I provoke you?Aren't you deliberately setting me up?,m How strange!The two of them did not want to say it out loud and only thought in their hearts. At this moment, they still maintained a peaceful expression on the surface. The Dragon Master did not say anything more and just took some precautions!However, he also wanted to warn the other party that he knew his background!You can deal with Yunxiao, but you'll have to think twice if you want to deal with me!Looking at the Lord of the clouds ... This fellow would not have a good ending.Speaking of which, Hong Yue had even given up her own great path universe. In that case, if she really wanted to deal with Yunxiao, it was probably not for the great path universe. Was it to eliminate her opponents one by one?What a good plan!If he lost the Dao universe, he could dispel some of Yunxiao's suspicions. Otherwise, it would be unbelievable for him to approach a level eight without careful consideration. Everyone would be on their guard against him.Now, Yun Xiao did not have such precautions. Although he felt that the Crimson Moon was very cunning, he would not have thought that the other party had given up on the Crimson Moon universe of their own accord.Thinking further, when Red Moon dealt with neo martial, was she waiting for this day?He was waiting for new martial to break through his Dao universe. Otherwise, how could he have a legitimate reason to give up the Dao universe?He was a ruthless person!The more he thought about it, the more he felt that the Crimson Moon was terrifying.Today, a small world had allowed him to see this fellow clearly. It was worth it!The Dragon Lord suddenly laughed,"Silvermoon, it's no big deal!" "The new martial artists are the key. There's no point in you two staying here. I'll send people to hunt them down. It's a joke for a few eighth level venerable sovereigns to discuss how to deal with a fifth level venerable sovereign. Let's go and take a look around tianfang world!""Alright!"The cloud Master had no objections, but Red Moon master had been targeted. At this moment, it was not appropriate for her to say anything.He was a little annoyed.Beasts of primordial chaos, even their brains had problems.Also, what made him a little annoyed was that the Silver Moon King might really have been hiding in that small world, but the Dragon Lord didn't seem to care. Was it because he really didn't care, or did he think that keeping the Silver Moon King would only disgust him?If an eighth level venerable sovereign had discovered something unusual, how could he have let someone escape?What a joke!As for the Dragon Master, he did not care about what he was thinking. As for his escape, if it really had something to do with Silvermoon, and the other party had discovered the abnormality, it might have something to do with that special energy.If these two weren't here, he would have been interested in going back to take a look.He searched for it.If he wasted too much time, the two of them might not be able to stay idle and go to the Dragon field to watch the show ... That would be troublesome. He had no reason to stop them from entering, but he also had no reason to lure them into the dragon field. ……The group of people took the dragon world and headed straight for tianfang world.At the same time.In the darkness, the Queen was extremely excited as she flew towards the chaos. At this moment, she couldn't even tell what she was.God?People?Chaos Beast?Or was it heaven's will?Or something else?Who knows!She only knew one thing. When faith corroborated the Dao and her great Dao appeared, she didn't rely on the Silvermoon great Dao universe. Instead, she relied on chaos!However, because it was a path of faith and he had even established a special divine Kingdom, ordinary methods of support were useless.And so, she thought back to how Silvermoon's true body had been able to fuse with the moon. She had completely fused her Dao into the primordial chaos, but as for what the consequences were ... She wasn't too sure.She only knew that at this moment, she ... Was a little abnormal, as if she was about to be dissolved by chaos!Yes!If not for the existence of the power of faith, she might have been dissolved by the constant birth of faith.In fact, a normal venerable sovereign would not do this, not even a Beast of Chaos. It was too stupid, too impulsive, too crazy ...He completely relied on the great Dao in the chaos.However, the chaos was boundless. One's Dao would constantly melt away with the chaos. Under normal circumstances, there would only be one outcome ... One's Dao would soon be completely diluted and melted away by the chaos.In conclusion, the venerable sovereigns who did this were probably all dead!The Queen wasn't very clear about this. She didn't have any good inheritances, and she didn't even have a world. She only had a good understanding of itinerant cultivators. She only felt that ... This would definitely be very impressive. Other people could fuse with the world, and she could fuse with the chaos. Wasn't that impressive?Although she felt that she was melting away ... She also thought that if 3 billion was not enough to keep subduing the human race, then 30 billion, 300 billion ... She could keep generating faith and naturally offset the melting power.In fact, at this point, this was the only way to save her life.The Queen didn't know, the Li Dynasty King didn't know, and director Zhao didn't know. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  They only knew that it was a close call!Not long after they escaped, they sensed an extremely powerful aura descending. The dragon world was so big, and anyone who wasn't blind knew what was happening.At this moment, the three of them entered the void."Fortunately, we left early, otherwise ..." Director Zhao rejoiced.It was too dangerous!To his surprise, the Queen's reaction was fast. She actually understood what Li Hao meant. It was obvious that it was Li Hao's warning, but he didn't use the stars of time. Instead, he took the stars away. It was too subtle.

Chapter 3197 Everyone Has Their Own Troubles
I don't even understand it!Why did you understand it?The Queen seemed to know what he was thinking and sneered,""Li Hao is extremely confident. Since he dared to leave the time star here, how could he let it be taken? Since it wasn't taken by anyone else, it must have been him who took it. However, he shouldn't have taken it without any warning and exposed us ... The Li Dynasty King and I don't care, but he obviously wouldn't let the Silver Moon Martial Master die!"If she and the king of Dali were the only ones present, she would only think that Li Hao was going to trick her again!However, since director Zhao was here, Li Hao wouldn't kill them on purpose.It was obvious that he was in danger.If the power of faith was exposed, it would mean that they had to leave quickly.Thinking about it simply, it was very clear.Director Zhao laughed and then felt a little scared,""It's all thanks to fellow Daoist lingyue's warning ... Oh right, lingyue, you can directly vindicate your Dao ... It'll be fine, right?" Queen was what people called her in private, and only Li Hao called her that.The other party had said to change his name to lingyue, so everyone just called him that."It's nothing, I just feel a little ... Bloated!"The Queen replied. Beside her, the king of Dali frowned slightly,""It's expanding. Is your God nation too big? why do I feel like ... You're constantly expanding and about to explode?"The other party had already proven his Dao as a venerable sovereign, but he had not.Moreover, the power of faith has been instantly absorbed by her. What should I do?You're really not a good thing!Also, the Queen beside him had returned to her human form. However, her body was indeed expanding at a very fast speed. It gave people the feeling that ... She was about to explode?What was going on?The Queen didn't know what was going on. She lowered her head and took a look. The next moment, her expression changed slightly. How could this be?She was swelling up like crazy! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  What the hell?Soon, she extracted some of the power of faith born in the divine Kingdom and suppressed it. However, she felt that she could not suppress it. Billions of humans were frantically generating power of faith at the moment, but ... It was still difficult to maintain.She also didn't understand and was a little suspicious. Director Zhao also took a look and found it a little weird. After a while, he said,"It doesn't matter. Let's retreat and go find Lord Marquis! Maybe it's because he just vindicated Dao and can't suppress his realm, so it's not very stable ..."The three of them did not have much experience.At this moment, he could only go to Li Hao.……At this moment, Li Hao was staring at the stars in front of him in a daze.He looked at it for a long time and then looked at second cat."If ... I mean if someone took away my time stars in the past, does it mean ... I can't control time anymore?"Second cat looked at him for a long time before saying,""What do you mean?" Li Hao looked at it for a long time before saying, you know."He's dead. ""Other than him, no one else can take it away," second cat sighed.Li Hao nodded. Yes, he was talking about Zhan Tiandi.Thinking of this, Li Hao said,"I'll just borrow it for a while for reference. I'll return it sooner or later. I don't care if he's dead or not, whether he can be resurrected or not, but before you want to take it away ... Can you tell me? after all, I've used it for a long time, and I have some feelings for it!"Second cat looked at him again and said,""Why do you want to create your own ...""Because that's what belongs to me. I'm a little worried about the gains and losses!"Li Hao exhaled."The more magical time is, the more afraid I am. When you're used to it and it's suddenly taken away ... I'm worried that I won't be able to withstand such a blow! So, I think ... I might as well do it myself! It'll be best if you succeed, but if you don 't, at least you'll be mentally prepared. At least you won't have your Dao heart collapse after being taken away!""Do you think they've run away?" he changed the topic."You know better than me, if director Zhao's star Dao is still there, then he'll run ..."Li Hao nodded. Right now, he was in the Dao universe, so director Zhao shouldn't be dead.Then he must have run away. Or perhaps, the Dragon Lord's goal wasn't that place but to scare himself.Since he was fine, that was good.Li Hao was relieved, but then he asked curiously,""Second cat, do you think that after reaching Level Seven, if you want to enter level eight, other than devouring the great Dao universe, the advancement should be related to Dao. And currently, from the master of Tian Fang's 9999 great DAOs as one, it should be related to the strength of the Dao network.""I've observed the Dao net of a rank seven venerable sovereign. There are about three to four thousand of them ... Are there more rank eight venerable sovereigns? Or is it simply that the great Dao is stronger, and has nothing to do with the number of Dao nets?"Second cat was speechless. You're asking me?How would I know!"I don't know,""You don't know?"Nonsense!Second cat despised this guy now. He used to like him asking questions. The way he asked questions was like him when he was young. He was curious, curious about everything, and the teacher could answer it.But I'm not a teacher.I still don't know a lot of the things you're asking me about, and you're still asking!What's the point of asking!Asking a bunch of questions that I don't know, does it make you seem very powerful?Second cat was very annoying!Second cat didn't know, so Li Hao could only guess,""I think it's more like walking on two legs. For example, the net of great Dao has 3000 great DAOs. If you become a seventh rank venerable sovereign, there are two ways to reach the eighth rank. First, if you strengthen yourself with the 3000 great DAOs, you can reach the eighth rank directly!""Second, increase the number of great DAOs. Increase the number of great DAOs in the Dao net and reweave and add them. Perhaps, when the number reaches four to five thousand, I can also enter level eight ..."

Chapter 3198 Everyone Has Their Troubles (1)
 You've already said so yourself, why are you still asking me?Li Hao continued, what I'm curious about now is how a level 8 martial artist can reach level 9. To learn from the master of Tian Fang and combine 9999 great DAOs into one? Also, was the master of Tian Fang considered strong among the rank 9 experts? If I count ... Does it mean that I don't need so many? maybe 9000 great DAOs, or even less, and I'll be level nine?"“……”Second cat didn't say anything. I don't know. Don't ask me, you can guess.This guy was only at the fifth step!Isn't it annoying to think about this and that all day long?Li Hao answered his own question,'I don't know about all this at the moment, but I do know that the path of a venerable sovereign is actually based on the number of great DAOs and the strength of the great DAOs! Comprehending the Dao is actually the right path. I feel that devouring will never reach the ninth step!""And now, I have a small guess about the Chaos Beast's level Seven Dao vindication ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and said,'if they vindicate Level Seven, they can only construct a Dao net according to the methods of itinerant cultivators or world Lords, but are all chaos beasts so talented? I don't think so. I think it's very likely that the ten thousand chaos DAOs are originally a Dao net. These chaos beasts rely on the chaos great Dao ... The chaos great Dao, or the chaos World, I think it can also be seen as a universe ... A great Dao universe!"However ... Li Hao added,"this method is useful against chaos beasts. It's best that humans don't try it!""Why?"Second cat asked.Li Hao smiled."The human body is not as strong as a Chaos Beast 's. Chaos beasts can devour worlds!" I suspect that chaos beasts vindicate the Dao in chaos because the power of Chaos can't burst them. But for humans ... Even if they cultivate the Dao of the physical body, they can still burst! "The two of them are actually not of the same system, and their physiques are different ...""If a normal human tries to imitate a Chaos Beast, I suspect that they'll end up exploding from the ever-expanding power of chaos!""If someone completely relies on chaos for his Dao, such an idiot will not live long. He will be completely melted by the chaos great Dao. It's not melting, but the infinite power of chaos will assimilate you. You can't resist it at all. In this way...You will be completely integrated with chaos!""The Beasts of Chaos, on the other hand, can be resisted. They were born in the chaos and are used to it. They survive to adapt to the chaos, but humans are different ..." Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Second cat nodded. It made sense and said,"Therefore, even the itinerant cultivators of the human race will not directly rely on the great Dao to enter the chaos. They will only mix into the chaos and not completely rely on it. Therefore ... There shouldn't be any fools like you said."Li Hao nodded. That was true.Even the ignorant venerable sovereigns usually vindicated their Dao in the world and would not come into contact with chaos as soon as they came. In this case, they could rely on the world in the early stage and did not need to rely on chaos. After he left the world, he knew more, so he probably wouldn't dare to do anything.At this thought, Li Hao smiled and said,""However, if we really do this and succeed, we might be very powerful. That's why I think that chaos beasts might be stronger than humans of the same combat power. Of course, humans have their own advantages. They are proficient in Daoism, so it's hard to say who is stronger. I just ... Envy the strength of the other party's physical body. No wonder they can accommodate a world. You must know, when I was cultivating the physical body Dao, I hoped that my cells could become the walls of the world ... Chaos beasts can naturally do it!"I'm so envious!Second cat thought for a while and shook his head,"How do I succeed?" If one merged into the chaos, the power of Chaos would attack them at all times. If they learned from itinerant cultivators and merged part of it, it would be useless. Instead, it would mix the great DAOs. If they merged all of it, they would accept the power of the entire chaos ... Unless they found a completely sealed area and no longer accepted any power of chaos. That way, they would not be able to become stronger! If you want to become stronger, you have to come out and accept the power of Primal Chaos ... You have to know that even a sealed world is actually absorbing Primal Chaos power ..."There was no way to resist it!He would die sooner or later. It was just a matter of time.It wanted to roll its eyes. Why was Li Hao always thinking of ways to court death?"That's true ..." Li Hao nodded in agreement."However, if we have the ability to resist and even digest the power of Chaos that's present all the time, wouldn't we be able to do it?""Unless you're an eighth or ninth level venerable sovereign, but once you're at that level ... What are you trying to achieve by doing this? To absorb more chaotic force? Wouldn't that be putting the cart before the horse? At this time, what you should consider more is that you've purified the power of your great DAOs, not that you lack energy. "That's right!Li Hao nodded.That's right, that's true.He shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He had only thought about the possibility of a Chaos Beast advancing to the seventh rank. Anyway, he would not do this. He had no confidence and was completely gambling. He might not even win. Even if he won, there might not be many benefits ... This kind of thing, whoever was stupid would do it.He didn't say anything else, but he was a little excited.""The dragon world is really gone!"I was right!Er Mao didn't say anything. The dragon world was gone, but there were still many rank Seven Worlds here. Why did he look like he was the strongest in the world other than rank eight?This guy was a little too arrogant.It expanded!

Chapter 3199 Everyone Has Their Troubles (1)
Did you forget that you were so scared that your face turned white?There were several Tier-7 great worlds nearby."Now, all I have to do is wait for those sector Lords to walk right into my trap, and for Silvermoon and the others to arrive ... I'm going to first slowly devour these worlds and quickly expand toward the dragon world ...""The Dragon Lord is not to be trifled with. I suspect that this fellow is the strongest existence in the four-direction region today!""Then don't provoke ..."Before second cat could finish, Li Hao shook his head."If I devour these worlds, even if I don't provoke him, he will still deal with me! However, I'm not willing to not devour these worlds. I'm doing this for justice ..."Go to hell!Ermao didn't bother to expose him. It was half and half. Li Hao probably felt some pity for the humans after seeing how miserable they were. After all, he was too young.However, it was also impossible to say that it was entirely for the sake of the human race here.It just so happened that they were doing it together.Saving the human race could be used as a flag, strengthening oneself and strengthening the world would be beneficial. There was no delay in both. Er Mao reminded,"You have to know that if you were to put so many humans together, you would need an incomparably huge world! However, if you were to bring such a huge world with you ... It would be impossible for you to take it away! At that time, once he was left behind ... He would instead be giving it to the Dragon Lord! It would've been troublesome to kill them One World at a time, but once they're left behind, the other party can kill them all!"Li Hao nodded. That was true.It was a big problem!Moreover, were the humans of the rat world ... Still alive?Old Zhao and the others had run away, but it was not easy to take those people with them. After all, it was a small world. They were too weak. If they were medium venerable sovereigns, they might have a chance of escaping with a small world.However, it would be difficult for director Zhao.Previously, he had only wanted to occupy a great world and let these humans go. However, once he was defeated and fled, leaving behind a world full of humans ... Damn, wouldn't the chaos beasts hold a man-eating feast?Li Hao frowned."It's a problem. I'm not a Chaos Beast, so it's probably not easy to carry me. The Black Panther is only at level five, and it's already difficult to carry Silver Moon. There's no hope of carrying another great world ... Unfortunately, the Black Panther is not as good as Emperor Cang ..."Then, he sneaked a glance at second cat.You and Emperor Cang are one family.Emperor Cang can do it, but you ... Can 't?Emperor Cang brought along a peak rank seven world and could run anywhere he wanted. You ... Can 't?Second cat really wanted to kill him with its tail!Yes, it knew that this fellow had its eyes on it again.Second cat was a little unhappy,"I'm not a big cat, that's one of the reasons!" Second, the big cat was a neo martial world and was one. It was born in the great path universe. This point was the key. It was very special. According to logic, the great path universe could not give birth to living creatures. Without the source of the world, how could it give birth to living creatures? However, big cat was born from the universe of origin ..."Li Hao was startled. At this moment, he froze.He was speechless for a while!Yes, the great Dao universe!Emperor Cang was not born from a world, but from the great Dao universe. This ... Great Dao universe, how could it give birth to living beings?He had never thought about this before.He was stunned and looked at second cat. After a long while, he said,""That's right. Back then, how did the celestial Thearch of the new martial arts world create Emperor Cang in the great Dao universe ... This ... Shouldn't be!"Wherever there was life, there must be a source of the world!The origin of the world was only born in the world, while the great Dao universe was not a world. The universe of the great path was only a unique space formed by the great path. Unless ... This universe of the great path could give birth to the source of life on its own. However, if that was the case, it meant that the universe of the source could actually give birth to life.However, on the side of neo martial, other than Emperor Cang, it seemed that no one else was born from the great Dao universe itself.Why was that so?The celestial Thearch was only a sixth rank venerable sovereign. How could he have done this?Second cat wagged its tail."It's hard to say. So, big cat is very special, and I ... Am not as special as it. We are said to be one, but big cat was really born in the universe of the great path. What about me? "I'm just a projection, so there are still some differences in essence. I wasn't born from your Silvermoon great Dao universe, so naturally, I can't be like the big cat, completely integrated with the world and the great Dao universe, and can be taken away as and when I want to. In fact, the new martial and the big cat are almost completely integrated, without any rejection. This is the key to its freedom!"Even beasts of primordial chaos could not do this.They did not come from this world.As for Li Hao, he was stunned again."That's right. Chaos beasts were born from chaos. Do you think ... Chaos also has an independent origin of the world?"“……” Second cat was also stunned. After a while, it nodded."I ... Should? It's normal. If chaos can give the world a source of life, then ... Then chaos itself should have ... Should be like this. "Li Hao nodded in agreement.At this moment, Emperor Cang's appearance was an accident. How could life be born in the great Dao universe?That's strange!It seemed that no one had mentioned it in neo martial.If the great Dao universe could give birth to living beings, they would be like Emperor Cang in the future. They could take the world with them and travel around perfectly. Even the beasts of Chaos would be envious."So senior second cat ... Can't take the great world with him?"Second cat was depressed."I can only be considered a Beast of Chaos. I can't be considered a creature of the universe of the great path. So, unless I reach the seventh level, I can drive the seventh level world, but it won't be too fast. Do you understand?""Understood!""There's still a difference between you and Emperor Cang ..."Li Hao nodded with a hint of regret.Second cat rolled its eyes again and said,"of course!" "However, big cat also has a weakness. That is, it was born in the neo martial world. Therefore, it can only be perfectly compatible with the neo martial world ... If it wants to lead other worlds, it's actually the same!"Wasn't that enough?Li Hao didn't say this. He only said regretfully,""It's a pity that the Black Panther wasn't born in the Silver Moon universe. Otherwise, it could run with the Silver Moon and no one would be able to see it. What a pity!"This person was not content at all!Second cat didn't care about him. There's only one big cat in the world. Otherwise, why would I be called second cat?As for Li Hao, he didn't say anything else. Instead, he was thinking ... That's right. Since I want to save so many people, whether it's out of anger or out of genuine intention, even if it's just for show ... I can't just abandon them!There were too many people, and silver Moon could not let them go.How many people would it take to devour so many worlds?Can't it only be stored in a level 7 world?If that's the case ... How am I supposed to take away a level 7 world?What a headache!I don't have a seventh rank Chaos Beast on my side. Even if er Mao really did enter the seventh rank, it's not a matter of whether it's willing or not. Even if it's willing, it's still very troublesome.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt a little troubled.Everything was going smoothly, but this ... Was a bit of a headache.At this moment, he really wished that there was someone like Emperor Cang who could possess a great world and leave and stay as he wished. Unfortunately, he didn't have the ability to do so.As for his great Dao River, it contained many void realms.However, the Mirage was, after all, just a Mirage.It wasn't true!People would starve to death sooner or later if they were stuffed in because the ethereal Plane couldn't grow crops and give birth to any life. If they really went to the ethereal Plane, they would die sooner or later even if they didn't die for a while!There was finally a problem on the road of construction, a problem that Li Hao couldn't solve.Unless, his own River of Dao could also give birth to a source of life.That was obviously impossible!If I had that ability, I would have become the Overlord of the world. Why would I need to run away with others?"Why could the new martial great Dao universe give birth to Emperor Cang?"Li Hao fell into deep thought again. At this moment, he was in a trance. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Strange neo martial!Could it be related to Zhan Tiandi?It should be impossible.Time didn't have the ability to create the source of life, right?But ... That might not be the case![PS: tomorrow is the fourth round of DNA testing, but it might be late again. It might be normal recently. Who knows how many rounds there will be? don't worry, everyone. The epidemic will disappear soon. All the best!]
