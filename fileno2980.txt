‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùIt was empty and silent.He was a little interested."This Dao is not bad. I'll try to comprehend it according to your train of thought. According to you, this Dao has different sides. It seems that our comprehension of Dao is still flawed."One Dao had many solutions.Li Hao nodded. In fact, it was not a bad idea to isolate one.One Dao for two purposes!It could be guarded against and cultivated.It's just nonsense, it's too inelegant.Thinking of this, Li Hao smiled."This technique is isolated from all other DAOs. It's immortal and proudly stands alone in the world. On the contrary, it's extremely filthy ... It's too inelegant to talk about farts. This technique cultivates the body and connects the heavens and the earth. The aperture that farts should be the aperture that connects the heavens!""The heavenly aperture?""What a waste of a good name!" Kong Ji laughed.Li Hao laughed and said,"that's not necessarily the case. Who doesn't have some filth in their body?" Eliminating filth is such a meaningful path. The heavenly aperture is worthy of its name!"Kong Ji thought about it and nodded.That's right!One law could separate 10000 DAOs, one law could cultivate one's body, external cultivation of defense, internal cultivation of one's self, reborn. A Dao of 4000 squares was indeed more powerful than imagined.The two of them didn't say anything more and continued to cultivate.The mysterious man sighed in his heart.He was a cultivator!As expected, there wasn't much future in cultivating the Dao step by step. It was the same Dao, but the two of them had obtained completely different results. However, there was no conflict. Instead, it was inclusive, and both of them had the heart to cultivate the Dao.If it was someone else, they might have already fought until their heads were bleeding.Why?If he fused them together and studied them to the extreme, he might be able to create an extremely powerful cultivation technique.A dual cultivation technique!As he watched the two of them continue to move forward, the mysterious man felt that this time, the two of them would probably be able to reach the 6000th step. As for the 7000th step, it was hard to say. If they really could reach the 7000th step, the two of them would definitely be able to reach the 7th step.Seventh rank, high level venerable sovereign. He was an expert in the entire Primal Chaos.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Three days passed in the blink of an eye.Tianfang world was not very peaceful. In the past few days, many Taoist connotation had been destroyed. The major worlds had not given up on destroying the Taoist connotation and drawing out the great path universe.The result ... Was obviously a failure. Not only did they fail, but they also caused great losses. Some of the Taoist connotation had remnants of it. These people destroyed the Taoist connotation, which meant that they had destroyed the remnants of the Supreme Emperor's Taoist connotation. There were several places that exploded.Even a few low-level venerable sovereigns had fallen.However, compared to a level-nine great path universe, this was nothing, and not many people cared too much about it.He was already dead anyway, and it wasn't like he was the one who died.Recently, venerable sovereigns had been running rampant in the entire Tian Fang.The Dragon returning temple had also become a forbidden area. Some people wanted to go to the dark Devil Ridge to take a look, but before they could Enter the Dragon returning temple, they were directly defeated by Wu Shan and almost killed a venerable sovereign.It was obvious that someone was testing the waters.The result was obvious. Wushan didn't want anyone to enter, and the dark Demon Ridge might really have a chance of drawing out the great Dao universe.As soon as the news came out, countless experts were making arrangements.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Crimson Moon world.The red moon master was merging with the forest world. With the addition of the forest world's venerable sovereigns, the red moon's losses were also replenished. More than ten venerable sovereigns had died before, and a large number of them were rank six. Today, although there were not many level-six Senlan, with the integration of Senlan and the addition of dozens of venerable sovereigns, the entire Dao universe had become stronger. On the side of Red Moon, some people had also begun to advance.Even though no grade 7 experts had appeared yet, only the Sen LAN sector Lord and AI Hong, but there were a few peak Grade 6 experts who had already glimpsed some Grade 7 Dao.This also meant that on the day Senlan completely integrated, perhaps ... The Crimson Moon could give birth to one or two more rank-7s.This calmed Red Moon master's previous irascibility.His mood was much better now!Although the sword Saint and the others had not been found, and the whereabouts of neo martial had not been revealed, it was certain that neo martial was not near the Crimson Moon. Otherwise, they would have made a move earlier.Previously, Hong Yue had lost three of his rank 7 venerable sovereigns, causing his mental state to be slightly unstable. Right now, with the addition of the Senlan realm Lord, his combat strength wasn't weak at all. In this case, although Hong Yue's strength was still slightly weakened, she was about to recover to her peak.In the huge Hall.Red Moon master sat at the top. Below her were sector Lord Sen LAN and venerable Emperor Ai Hong. Below her were some rank 6 venerable emperors, including Yan Fang.

However ... Now that the new martial artists are missing and Tian Fang is in chaos, I, Hong Yue, won't be hated at this moment. Senlan, you don't mind, do you?"Sector Lord Sen LAN shook his head,"it's better to keep a low profile."Red Moon master smiled and nodded.Previously, when the Senlan realm Lord had dared to stop him, he had wanted to kill him. But now, he admired him a little more. Being a world Lord was different. He had more freedom than the other Type 7 experts in the Crimson Moon realm.Of course, this was also because the other party had integrated into the Crimson Moon and was now one of them.Sector Lord Sen LAN could still escape ... If they completely fused, it would be hard for him to escape. He could still do it now, but ... Was red Moon Lord still worried about this?He was the master of the red moon. If the other party dared to leave, it would be difficult to even protect the seventh-rank.

2981 Chapter 489
In one or two years, if they wanted to leave, they would have to give up all their energy. Would Senlan do that?He didn't say it out loud. At this moment, he smiled and said,""Some days ago, there were some problems with the Crimson Moon and neo martial arts took the initiative, which made them laugh at us. Now ... I, the Crimson Moon, have recovered a lot. There are two things to do at the moment. First, find the foundation of neo martial arts!""Second, the change in tianfang!""I don't need to say anything about the first thing. The second thing is that the great Dao universe has appeared in tianfang. Hong Yu and Ji Huo went there before ... Unfortunately, they were killed by the two bastards, Wu Shan and the neo martial human King. This caused my Hong Yue to become the one with the least infiltration and understanding of tianfang in the four-sided domain.""Not long ago, Wu Shan took action again and fought against yaoyang. The neo martial human King also appeared ... Wu Shan left very quickly and took charge of the dark Demon Ridge. There are some rumors in Tian Fang that the dark Demon Ridge is the key to opening the great Dao universe!""In addition ... Wushan might hope to open the great path universe and take the opportunity to escape from Yunxiao. Yunxiao didn't hide this matter. Since sovereign Yunxiao released the news, he's either plotting against someone or ... It's true. He wants to use the spread of the news to force Wushan to not leave. Otherwise, Wushan's enemies will all kill him!"As a rank eight Lord, he was still very concerned about Tian Fang's matters.Otherwise, he wouldn't have allowed two tier 7 experts to go over.He just didn't expect such an outcome.Now that the new martial human King had stayed there and refused to leave, it was very likely that Wu mountain had formed an alliance with him. Now, the dark Demon Ridge might be the key to opening the great Dao universe, and it had been occupied by Wu mountain!A level-nine universe. In fact, Red Moon master could tolerate this place being taken away by others, such as Wushan. However, he definitely couldn't tolerate this place being taken away by a human King.Once the human King was seized, it would really enter level eight ... Red Moon master was very clear that if the human King really reached level eight, he ... Might not be able to defeat him.That was the truth!Hundun wasn't just about age.It wasn't that whoever was older and had advanced for a longer time would be stronger.The neo martial human King cultivated both yin and yang, and his Dao of saber had reached perfection. It was said that he not only cultivated yin and yang, but he might have opened up a new Dao within yin and yang, a new world!If such a guy really entered level eight, Hong Yue would be in trouble!He looked at the two rank 7s."Do you two think that I should get involved in tianfang's matter?" he asked.As soon as these words came out, AI Hong's expression changed! Only two rank seven venerable sovereigns had died!If he were to go ... To be honest, he was afraid.Wu Shan, human King, these people had all killed him at the seventh level of the Crimson Moon. "My Lord ... There are many Lords of major worlds over there now. I heard that Chi Yang, Dragon Lord, light, and cloud sky, a few level eight venerable sovereigns, are all eyeing them covetously ..."AI Hong said in a low voice,"I think that at this stage, we should spend more time and energy to conquer the three worlds nearby. We should take advantage of the fact that the others are too busy to deal with other things and recruit the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns!" The Alliance is too weak now. They even tried to attack the Crimson Moon ..."In short, he didn't want it to be over.He hoped that the red moon master would also give up and stay here to take down the three worlds near the red moon. By then, it might not be too bad.This way, it was even safer.There were only four seventh level venerable sovereigns in the three great worlds, but Hong Yue had two seventh level venerable sovereigns and one eighth level venerable sovereign ... There was a chance to take them down together, but if they were to take them down one by one, the chances would be even greater!Moreover, it was very safe.The red moon master did not say anything.ai Hong's words were not without reason.However, he glanced at the Sen LAN realm Lord and smiled,""Senlan, what do you think?""Me?"Sector Lord Sen LAN was a little taken aback, I've just joined. At this moment, he swiftly replied,"What Lady Hong Yue said makes sense, and so does venerable Emperor Ai Hong! Tianfang is in turmoil and there are many grade 8s. Even if Daren goes ... He might not be able to succeed! Moreover, whether it would open or not was just a guess, and it might not be true! It might take tens or hundreds of years or even longer!"  Best novel online free at‚Äã ùïüùï†ùïßùïñùïùùïìùïöùïü  "As for subduing the three worlds nearby ... I think it's more realistic!"The forest orchid sector Lord said a few more words before continuing,"Of course, on Tian Fang's side, if the great Dao universe really opens, the ninth-tier great Dao universe ..."He sighed with emotion."At that time, if the red moon had missed it, no matter if the other tier 8 martial artists or the neo warrior human King had taken it away, it would have been impossible for a tier 9 to be born. Otherwise, the neo warrior human King would have stepped into the eighth tier!"It was all nonsense.Everyone knew about this situation!Therefore, Red Moon master was slightly hesitant."My Lord, why don't we conquer the three worlds first? if tianfang universe hasn't opened yet, we'll have a chance ..." AI Hong said hurriedly.Red Moon master nodded.Sector Lord Sen LAN frowned,"I'm afraid ... That something might happen midway. If the tianfang great Dao universe really appears during the subjugation process, should we give up or head over?" They could either focus on one side or ... Give up on both! Otherwise, if the red moon and the three worlds were in a war, would Lady Red Moon stay or leave? If we leave, the three worlds will counterattack. If we don't leave ... Tian Fang won't have a chance at all. It'll be difficult to escape!"AI Hong's words make sense, but are you sure that the tianfang great Dao universe won't open during the process of subduing?

Chapter 2982 Only Lacking An Eastern Wind!
If it did appear, not only would you not be able to take down the three worlds, you would also be offending them. At that time, if you went to tianfang, you would be in big trouble. If you didn't go ... You could only watch as they took you down. You couldn't do anything about it!This could be considered a sincere word!Although venerable sovereign AI Hong felt that this outsider was against her the moment she arrived, she didn't say anything after some thought.If such a situation really happened, if he insisted on it today ... Red Moon master would definitely blame him, and that would be very troublesome.Sector Lord Sen Lan's considerations weren't wrong.What if it was really such a coincidence?Red Moon master was obviously clear about this. Otherwise, she wouldn't have made things difficult for him. At this moment, she also said,""What Senlan said makes sense ... But if we don't care about either side, we'll completely miss the opportunity. Now, I'm thinking about choosing one of the two ... I can give up on taking in the three worlds for the time being, or I can give up on tianfang!"He looked at the crowd."What do you all think?"The others didn't dare to make a sound.At this moment, Red Moon master suddenly looked at a corner, where a venerable sovereign had shrunk himself, and said,""Huai King, what do you think?"As soon as he said this, the entire Hall fell silent. The next moment, countless people looked at him with disdain.Huai King?That rebel from new martial!'This shameless guy has lost all the face of a venerable sovereign. He kowtowed to the red moon master in front of countless venerable sovereigns ... To be honest, even the venerable sovereigns of the red moon had never done this before.'If he wasn't a venerable sovereign, he might have done it before.However, at the venerable sovereign level, no one would do this, and red Moon master would not force it.Venerable sovereigns all had dignity.More importantly, the red moon Lord really didn't kill him, and she actually asked King Huai such an important question ... What the hell.King Huai, on the other hand, was somewhat apprehensive. He carefully walked out and directly prostrated himself on the ground."How can I participate in such an important matter? However, I can only add one thing to my master's question ... I know neo martial too well!"He hurriedly said,"my Lord, neo martial has disappeared. Before this, Heaven's Fate and I were just bait thrown out by the Supreme neo martial. In the end, when we killed ... Killed ... Killed Sir awakening God, neo martial actually didn't appear. This means that they have abandoned us. It means that they have a bigger goal, which is more important than the seventh rank!""Neo martial must be a great disaster for the Crimson Moon!"He braced himself and said,"the biggest problem with neo martial arts is that there are many experts, but many people can't step into the seventh level. It's not that they're not strong enough, not that their Taoist connotation is not enough, not that their Foundation is not deep enough. Some people in neo martial arts are too talented!" "However, many people died in the battle against the heaven sovereign. Later, they were resurrected by the human King and their yin and yang were reversed. However, the yin and yang of Xin Wu were imbalanced and there was a serious lack of yang energy. Some venerable sovereigns also lacked yang energy ..."  Best novel online free at‚Äã ùïüùï†ùïßùïñùïùùïìùïöùïü  "Now, neo martial has disappeared, and they don't even care about Crimson moon's territory ... If it was before, when neo martial's territory was here ... I'll say ... I'll say something disrespectful. Crimson Moon might be ... Much worse than now!""Therefore, whether it's tianfang or the three major worlds, I think that these are all opportunities. However, neo martial is a crisis!"He swallowed his saliva and said,"what my Lord should do is to investigate which major world in the square region is a world of extreme yang and strength. Neo martial is most likely planning this. Of course, the second possibility is ... The other party has gone to Tian Fang in hopes of seizing Tian Fang!" There are only two possibilities. ""Both of these can help neo martial artists enter grade eight!""Yes!" He raised his head with an uneasy look."Neo martial artists are very scary!"At this moment, someone sneered,"you're scared out of your wits, right?" How come I didn't see that the neo martial artists are so scary?"As he spoke, he glanced at King Huai with some disdain.Aren't you a neo martial artist?King Huai was a little embarrassed, but he quickly suppressed it and lowered his head."My Lord should be clear about this. New martial artists ... Are extremely difficult to deal with! I can't represent neo martial. In fact, I can only be considered a venerable sovereign of the yin-yang world, not a neo martial's venerable sovereign! The real neo Martial Emperor is the human King, Supreme, sword venerable, blood Emperor, and others, not people like me and Tian Ji. ""I can guarantee that new martial arts must be planning to advance, which is more important than dealing with Red Moon!"He looked at Red Moon master."My master seems ... Seems to have neglected this ... Or ... My master has already made arrangements. I'm too inexperienced. But my master must find out the specific whereabouts of neo martial!" "Venerable the sword and the others just happened to be there. They don't represent the whereabouts of the neo martial arts main force ..."Red Moon master's eyes flickered.Neo martial ... Was planning to go to the Sun World! As for forest orchid master, she also glanced at Huai King. Her eyes moved slightly, but she did not say anything. It had to be said that this possibility was still very high. However, everyone's attention had been drawn away by venerable the sword and the human King. They could only be sure that the other party was not in the red moon region.Listening to what he said ... New martial might have a big plan!"Extreme yang world?""It's hard to say," she mumbled."But as far as I know, there aren't many extreme yang worlds in the chaos. The rank 8 crimson sun World is one, and there's a rank 7 scorching sun World in the Crimson sun region. There's also a rank 7 Diamond World in the Dragon region. The world of light is also considered the path of yang ..."Was neo martial planning for these worlds?He frowned slightly. What King Huai said was not unreasonable. On the contrary, it made a lot of sense!

Chapter 2983 Only Lacking An Eastern Wind!
We can't neglect the whereabouts and actions of neo martial's local forces!People like the human King and revered sword might just be bait thrown out by the locals to attract people's attention. Although the neo martial artist human King was the boss, it was normal for the boss to come out as bait in order to advance the neo martial artist.Originally, he had put this matter aside, but now he was interested.""Huai King, you mean ..."King Huai swallowed his saliva and carefully said,"My Lord, right now ... Right now, everyone is thinking that we only have two choices! "It's either tianfang or the three great worlds. My idea is ... Why don't ... We set up an ambush in an extreme yang world, a level eight great world. I think it's very difficult for the current neo martial artists to break through, and the chances of breaking through to Level Seven are very high. So, scorching sun or Vajra, why don't we choose one and set up an ambush on one? once the neo martial really attacks, we ... Attack the neo martial!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe entire Hall was silent.Many venerable sovereigns looked at him with disdain.Some of the newly-joined venerable sovereigns were sneering.Betrayers were often more ruthless than outsiders!This Huai King was truly ruthless.He was a neo martial artist and understood neo martial very well. Now, he wanted Red Moon to ignore everything else and attack neo martial directly ... If it really succeeded, neo martial's native land would be destroyed. Even if the human King was outside, he wouldn't be able to cause too much trouble.But ... At this moment, AI Hong said coldly,""My Lord, just listen to King Huai's words and forget it! There was too much uncertainty! Moreover, one is in the chiyang domain and the other is in the Dragon domain. I don't have a 100% chance of crossing the domain ... If that's the case, I'd rather choose between the three worlds and tianfang!"It was hard to say whether King Huai's words were true or false. In any case, the suggestion he gave was more of a gamble.Everything was just King Huai's guess!He was a neo martial artist's low-level venerable sovereign, but he could actually determine the specific whereabouts of neo martial artists. To be honest, most people did not believe it. This person was even a neo martial artist powerhouse. Perhaps ... There was a trap!‚Äã The level of trust was very low!Red Moon master had actually thought of something, but now, seeing that AI Hong and the other venerable sovereigns were disdainful, he thought for a while and said,""What if the goal of neo martial arts is the world of light?"King Huai was a little nervous,"then ... Then it's in Tian Fang!" Of course, I don't think it's likely to be a world of light ...""Why?""First, the enemy is a rank 8 world! "Secondly, the Son of God of light and the Silver Moon King Li Hao are on good terms. In fact, it is possible for them to be roped in to neo martial. The two have a very close relationship. As far as I know, in order to kill awakening God Thearch, the master of light might have personally moved the Son of God Of Emptiness here. Otherwise, he would not have come so quickly. That day, I even ... Vaguely sensed an extremely powerful aura!"King Huai continued,"from what I know, when venerable sword and the awakening God venerable Emperor met, I heard that the lonely deity was still in Tian Fang at the time. In the end, even a seventh rank venerable Emperor would need some time to get here. The lonely deity came very quickly ... Could it be that the Lord of Light personally sent him here?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe venerable sovereigns who didn't pay much attention to him before were stunned.That's right!According to the intelligence reports, lonesome void had still been in the Skylands world at the time.At this moment, two wandering cultivators in the crowd had a thought ... King Huai ... Didn't betray him?They were all too clear about this!They knew very well how Kong Ji had come out.This matter was also a mistake that Li Hao had made. He and Kong Ji had both forgotten about this matter. They had forgotten that Kong Ji had actually appeared in Tian Fang that day. In the end, he had appeared in the Crimson Moon region in the blink of an eye!How did it come?Why did they come so quickly?Although no one seemed to remember this matter now, and no one seemed to have noticed it, King Huai had taken the initiative to bring it up. Not only had he brought it up, but he had also brought up a bold idea. It was a gift from the radiant sovereign!King Huai continued,"I've heard that the radiant sovereign's heart aches for this son of his, and that he's his only son. He hopes that he can inherit the divine light plane. However, the Lord of the eighth step is an undying and imperishable existence! "If the empty deity continues to stay in the light, his limit will be at the seventh rank. It'll be difficult for him to make another big breakthrough to the eighth rank ... Now, if we can form an alliance with neo martial and destroy the Crimson Moon, there's ... There's a possibility that neo martial will give up the Crimson Moon ..."King Huai said nervously,"I'm just making some speculations. It doesn't mean it's true. Perhaps Kong Ji has other ways to quickly arrive, or it's just a clone that appeared in Tian Fang. It's all a smokescreen ... Everything depends on my master's judgment!"Red Moon master laughed. She looked at him and suddenly said,""Previously, Senlan advanced. You guys had a chance of advancing, but I suppressed it. Do you hate it?""No, no, no!""Being able to live is my greatest desire!" King Huai hurriedly said."Hahaha!" Red Moon master laughed out loud. Soon, with a wave of his hand, a powerful great Dao power engulfed King Huai. He laughed. "You're very interesting. To be able to live in neo martial arts until today, you're indeed extraordinary! Since you're only one step away from the 3rd tier ... I'll fulfill your wish today! King Huai, stay in the red moon. The red moon needs a wonderful person like you!"This is so interesting!Although the other party was not strong, so what?He was too powerful. He didn't dare to stay. Advancing from rank two to rank three was nothing.In the next moment, King Huai's aura rose sharply. In an instant, he broke through the barrier of the second stage and stepped into the third stage. He originally had the hope of directly entering the third stage. At this moment, King Huai was overjoyed and hurriedly prostrated himself,"Thank you for your help, my Lord!""Hahaha, you're the interesting one!"Red Moon master laughed."But ... We can't be sure of neo martial's whereabouts, and it's hard to judge. Sun World is in another region ... But it doesn't matter. If we can't destroy neo martial, how about we destroy the human King?"He laughed. At this moment, he seemed to have made a decision.According to King Huai, if light was not the target of neo martial, then neo martial's territory was not in Tian Fang ... In Tian Fang, there was only one neo martial human King!Even if the two sides were cooperating, cooperation was just cooperation. What did it matter?Red Moon master made a decision.He had to put the three worlds aside for now. He had to plan for Tian Fang. He had been a little hesitant before, but now he had made up his mind!Of course, he didn't follow the forest orchid sector Lord and Huai King's wishes. These two were new and he didn't fully trust them.Since that was the case ... He would just do as he thought!Tian Fang, I, Hong Yue, also want a share!Killing the human King would be the best outcome. Even if he couldn 't, the Lord of the clouds would definitely be unwilling to let Wushan leave the clouds. This was also an opportunity. He and Yunxiao had made some agreements long ago, but it was a pity that Wushan had broken them.This time, he could go and discuss it again.He didn't directly tell them his plan.As for King Huai, he did not say anything. However, according to his judgment ... There was a high probability that this person would go to Tian Fang.As for the other party really agreeing to ambush neo martial ...Ambush, my ass!Don't you need time to travel?Neo martial had been planning for a long time. Perhaps it would be launched soon. If the red moon Lord really chose this way, it would be like drawing water with a wicker basket. Of course, in that case, there might still be a chance to protect their old nest!"People!"King Huai sighed in his heart. It was not a good thing to play with one's desires. Sometimes, Hong Yue's Dao would expand one's desires too much, affecting one's enemies and oneself at the same time.To Red Moon master, seizing the tianfang great Dao universe and killing the human King would maximize his benefits!As the owner of desire, once he had a desire, it would inevitably expand infinitely.In addition, the Huai clan King and the forest orchid sector Lord's words seemed reasonable, but everything they said seemed to be saying that going to Tian Fang was useless. These two people had already surrendered, but when they said this, it made him even more rebellious and even more confident in his own decision.This person must go to Tian Fang!He was halfway done with his big plan!Now, all he needed was an opportunity. The tianfang great path universe would truly open and strengthen Red Moon Lord's thoughts. He would feel that his decision was correct. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  I can only do this much.King Huai lowered his head, digesting the power of the great Dao and stabilizing his cultivation. He also ignored the envious, jealous, and disdainful gazes around him.Why are you all looking down on me? you people ... Will all die sooner or later!All of them were so stupid that they didn't even know it!Could everyone cultivate the path of desire?If one wasn't a peerless genius, if one wasn't strong-willed, then one would be a fool. Red Moon Lord could still suppress them, but these people couldn 't.

Chapter 2984 Exiting Seclusion (1)
Everyone was playing the role they were supposed to play.Some people acted seriously, but in the end, they couldn't even tell if they were acting or if life was really like this.Who said that life was not an act?King Huai was acting.At this moment, Li Hao was also acting.The role he played was the Dao.In Dao chess, Li Hao seemed to have become a Dao himself. He played different DAOs and different Dao Masters, built different Dao nets, and sensed different cores of the great DAOs.Comprehending the Dao was a form of entering the Dao.If you don't completely immerse yourself in it, how can you comprehend Dao?4400 squares.Li Hao paused for a long time. This path was the path of acting, the path of an actor. Or, according to others, it was the path of imitation. Imitation was actually not a very powerful path.Otherwise, it wouldn't just be one of the small grid lines and not a whole number of thousands.However, to Li Hao, all DAOs had their own unique characteristics.Even the worst Dao, such as the Dao of attachment, had its own unique points.In the long river, the number of stars and the number of little realms had increased, but they did not grow. The number was much more than before. It was no longer 360 little realms. At this time, it had reached 400 little realms.Fire element world.The appearance of 10000 DAOs, the real appearance of 10000 DAOs. Although many of them were just imitations, there was still some charm to them. This was Li Hao's imitation.The Dao net was no longer an extremely simple and crude fire path. It was a Dao net formed by some other trash paths.At this moment, the Dao network had more than 4000 great Dao.Li Hao was weaving!The entire fire elemental realm was madly expanding. The ferocious tiger within the realm was now incomparably powerful and its aura was monstrous.The Dao of the Dao he had walked through was all displayed in it, but it was mainly of the fire element. Li Hao was weaving a true small world. At this moment, his little world of fire was not much different from a real small world, except that it could not give birth to life.There were actually not many DAOs in a small world. The Dao net in a small world could be as many as a few thousand, or as few as a few hundred.He used the Dao of imitation to imitate the Dao he had comprehended before. Although it was still inferior to the real Dao, it was enough for Li Hao.After copying 4400 great DAOs, which were mainly of the fire element, Li Hao found something different.The fire elemental world started to look illusory.Space?He had previously guessed that the fusion of 9999 great DAOs, according to the arrangement of the Dao chess, would form space.Now, it seemed that his guess might not be wrong.Perhaps the way of chess was the true inheritance of the master of tianfang.After imitating more than 4000 great DAOs, and they weren't even the original great DAOs, the fierce tiger in the fire elemental realm seemed to be faintly discernible. It seemed to have the ability to travel through space!The master of tianfang probably didn't expect that someone would be able to use an unremarkable imitation Dao to such perfection when they reached the 4400th square.At this moment, he began to weave a true Dao web ... Even if the Dao was not too real.Ferocious Tiger leap!It shuttled through space...Only, the distance it travelled through wasn't large, and the area it covered wasn't large either.But to Li Hao, it was a form of motivation. He was even a little excited!If he continued to imitate it, even if he could not truly comprehend 10000 DAOs, he might be able to comprehend the space Dao in the end.Space ... Seemed to be more complicated than he had imagined.It wasn't just the power of one Dao, but the fusion of 10000 DAOs.Li Hao had been stuck at the 4400th square for too long.The mysterious man was confused.4400 squares, just a small path!Previously, the gap between Li Hao and Kong Ji was only 500 squares. Based on their speed and the increasingly difficult situation, Li Hao might be able to catch up to Kong Ji very soon. Even if he couldn 't, he would keep closing the gap.However, Li Hao stayed at the 4400th square for a day.On this day, Kong Ji had already crossed 5000 squares. This guy was very fast. At this time, he was already moving towards 6000 squares. As for Li Hao ... He still had 4400 squares.Did he encounter a problem?The mysterious man was confused.It's not the great Dao of the thousand, but just a small Dao. Why did it stop here for so long?The shadow knew a little about the 4400 squares of Dao and had the ability to copy them.For cultivators, it had some disguising effects, but the effect wasn't very good. Disguises were fake after all. This kind of great Dao was suitable for those who were sneaky. The real experts didn't care about it.No matter how real he was, it was still fake.But was such a small path difficult for a genius like Li Hao?He didn't understand! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Or was it that Li Hao's perception was wrong, and he couldn't cross it?The mysterious man wanted to remind them several times ... But gave up in the end. As a witness, he couldn't participate in it and tell them how to comprehend it. Besides, Li Hao's comprehension might be different from what others imagined.Despite his curiosity, the mysterious man didn't say anything. As long as Li Hao persisted, the chess game would continue to play.Moreover, the two of them hadn't been inside for too long. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Just as the shadow was thinking, Li Hao's body suddenly became filled with fire element.A ferocious Tiger was faintly visible.The illusory figure's vision blurred for a moment, and the Tiger seemed to have disappeared. Taking another look ... It had indeed disappeared. The illusory figure was a little bewildered. In the next moment, his heart jolted in shock. He turned around and saw a massive tiger staring at him.The mysterious man's eyes changed dramatically!What?When did this Tiger come?Where did it come from?How could it appear in an instant?Shuttle?Space?Or something else?

Chapter 2985 Exiting Seclusion (2)
The Tiger's eyes were also somewhat dazed. It didn't seem like a real Tiger, but ... Li Hao!The Tiger's eyes were filled with confusion. It looked at the shadow for a moment before it disappeared again and returned to Li Hao. Li Hao stood up and walked out of the 4400th square.He ignored the shadow.The mysterious man couldn't hold it in anymore. His eyes changed and he said in a deep voice,""Fellow Daoist Li Hao, just now ..."Li Hao raised his head and said with some embarrassment,""I can't help it. I'll try out a minor Dao I just comprehended." Go to hell!What small path?A ferocious Tiger instantly appeared beside him. One had to know that even if one was only at the absolute peak, one could tear space and arrive instantly. However, the definition of tearing space in this world was completely different.The so-called space in the eyes of a Paragon, in the eyes of a true expert, was just the path of a Dao, from one end of the Dao to the other.There were huge limitations to it, and its characteristics were obvious and it caused a huge commotion.If the true Dao of space was like this ... Then how could a space venerable sovereign be considered an extremely powerful venerable sovereign?Just now, Li Hao's instantaneous appearance without any great Dao fluctuations felt like he had appeared out of thin air.Why was it like this?The master of tianfang ...What did Li Hao learn?At this moment, the mysterious man looked at Li Hao in confusion.""Did you gain some comprehension of space?""No, I didn 't!"Li Hao shook his head and denied it.He really didn 't.It was just a pseudo-space. Firstly, it was not real.Second, the Dao was incomplete.Compared to the true space, it was far inferior. The true Dao of space was not that simple. He had only tried it, but it was only a teleportation of consciousness, mixed with some force. Even his main body could not teleport instantly.Was this considered the way of space?It didn't count!It wasn't even considered superficial!Of course, it could also be considered as superficial.Li Hao was still a little happy. His long comprehension had not been in vain. It was not bad. Of course, he did not dare to compare himself with the master of Tian Fang, as that would be too unfair. The true great Dao of space must be unbelievably strong!He had only learned a few scraps, so how could he dare to say that he had any comprehension of space?Are you lying to me?The mysterious man cursed!No comprehension?If he didn 't, how did that Tiger appear?He didn't even react.Although he was cursing, the mysterious man didn't say it out loud. He only said with a serious tone,""The Dao of space is not simple! A real space was not like a small world where a crack could be considered space ... A real space would reverse time and space, and there would be no heaven, no earth, no chaos! With a wave of the hand, the world is complete ..."Li Hao was stunned for a moment before he nodded.He knew that it was very powerful, but according to the illusionary figure ... It was even more terrifying.Did this realm have a world origin?It was fine if he didn't have it ... Although it was terrifying to outsiders, Li Hao could still accept it. However, if he could create an origin with a wave of his hand, it would not be terrifying, but horrifying!Li Hao felt that it was normal for a level nine venerable sovereign to do this. However, if he could create a true world with a wave of his hand, then that was not normal. He was a true master of creation!With a wave of his hand, he could create all things and living creatures.Even chaos could be created!The mysterious man wanted to say something, but Li Hao said,""Senior, can a wave of the hand create a world and give birth to life?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWas this the main point?The mysterious man was speechless. After a while, he snorted and said,""I don't know,"That's not my main point. The main point is, did you have any comprehension of space?"I don't think so!"Li Hao answered his own question."If it can, it means that back then, a large number of venerable sovereigns could appear in Tian Fang. Countless venerable sovereigns, at least 9999 venerable sovereigns!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùAlright, I don't understand what you're saying.He probably understood a little.Do you really think that the master of Tian Fang can casually create 9999 Dao worlds?This ... Forget it, it's not good to belittle or exaggerate at this moment, so the virtual image could only say,""The void has entered 5400 squares. You're 1000 squares behind him!"Previously, one had 3000 slots while the other had 2000 slots.The difference was also a thousand!But now, it was still 1000, which actually meant that Li Hao was much slower.Li Hao smiled."It's fine. I'll try my best to reach more than 5000 squares. It's a 50 - 50 ratio. It's not necessarily a good thing to eat too much at once. Kong Ji needs to comprehend life and death, Nirvana, recovery, light and darkness. He needs to go further to comprehend the core that he wants to comprehend. I don't need to do that."Right now, he was also pursuing the Dao of the two extremes. However, the two extremes were not considered the core. The true core was the power of 10000 DAOs. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  The mysterious man was speechless.You F * cking ...Forget it, I don't want to curse.He shouldn't have cursed!I had high hopes for you, but this kid didn't give me any face at all.Li Hao chuckled and continued playing."I see that you've gained a lot," the mysterious man asked."Are you still unable to reach the fifth-tier?"To be honest, Li Hao had gained a lot. In the Shadow's eyes, reaching the fifth step shouldn't be a problem.It was terrifying!However, he also felt that it was only natural.Li Hao shook his head."It doesn't matter if it's level five or level six. What's stopping me now isn't my comprehension. It's the power of a great Dao!""You're still short of Dao crystals?""Actually ... Dao chess also contains a lot of power of the great Dao ..." The mysterious man said after some thought."Thank you, senior, but forget it." Li Hao sighed.Don't you need it?"I've done some calculations," Li Hao said."If I want to perfect my Dao and reach level five, let's not talk about other things. At this stage, I've calculated ..."To perfect the 400 little realms, one realm would require at least 10 million great Dao crystals.

Chapter 2986 Exiting Seclusion (3)
It was comparable to the value of a small world!About ... 4 billion?It might be a little less. After all, he had already perfected a part of it, so he could count it as three billion great Dao crystals.A medium-scale world could only be sold for more than 100 million, which was equivalent to dozens of medium-scale worlds.He wouldn't have known if he hadn't counted, but after counting ... Li Hao sighed.The fifth step was so difficult.Why did he want so much?" 3 billion great Dao crystals!""What?"The mysterious man was stunned. Are you kidding me?How much?3 billion?Do you want to advance to the fifth tier or the seventh tier? if you want to advance to the seventh tier, I can understand that you need so much, but you ... Are only advancing to the fifth tier, okay?"Senior," Li Hao explained,"eating a lot means that your Foundation is strong. I can't say that I can defeat all middle-stage venerable sovereigns when I reach level five, but there aren't many middle-stage venerable sovereigns who can match me ..."With the power of 400 Jie, Li Hao didn't dare to say that he could blow up a level 7 martial artist, but he felt that if he could really enter Level 5, even if he wasn't as powerful as the current venerable sword, the gap shouldn't be too big.That was why he had to plan more.Only a rank eight world can satisfy my needs.At this moment, the virtual shadow frowned slightly.""Even Tian Fang's master wouldn't have consumed so much energy during this period of time, and his battle-power wouldn't be weak either! Are you on the wrong path?"It wasn't that the more consumed the better!Was the master of Tian Fang strong?But at this time, the consumption should not be so great.Li Hao smiled and didn't say anything.He and the master of Tian Fang did not walk the same path. He was walking the path of gathering true worlds and creating the mini chaos. It was not a copy. It was not simply creating a Dao domain, but ... A world!If it was just a simple Dao domain, it would naturally be much simpler.Li Hao, on the other hand, hoped to create a real world. Even if he couldn't create a world origin, it didn't matter. At the very least, it would be interesting to build up the foundation.Many years later, if he died and the river still existed, and someone entered it, perhaps ... They would really think that they had entered the chaos and entered the era of myriad realms!If one were to fish out a small world from the chaos and place it in the river before a venerable sovereign was born in it, once a venerable sovereign was born, he would walk out of the world and enter the chaos ... At one glance, all the worlds would be destroyed and there would be no life. Would they mistakenly think that the chaos had been destroyed?How interesting!He really wanted to try! However, after thinking about it ... Forget it, he didn't have the time to do all this. Besides, Changhe was still very young at this stage.Li Hao didn't say anything and continued to comprehend the Dao in Dao chess.He wanted to perfect his Dao of copying. The more he copied, the more space he would comprehend. Not to mention anything else, with the underhand technique, he could be an assassin in the future, an assassin who suddenly appeared and killed with one strike!This method was not bad.This time, he seemed to have gained quite a lot. Li Hao was in a good mood. Dao chess was really a treasure. Every time he entered, he felt that he had gained a lot.At this moment, Li Hao set a small goal for himself.This time, he opened another 100 little realms.Actually, it wasn't difficult.He had gathered 500 Jie!Alternating between reality and illusion, completing the true thousand paths of cultivation, and then using this as a Foundation to expand the 500 little realms, maybe he didn't need to expand all of them, but just expand a part of them and he would be Level 5?Having said that ... At this stage, there wasn't much of a barrier between the fourth and the sixth tier. From the fourth to the fifth tier, there was only a slight difference in the degree of comprehension of a Dao and the strength.When his strength reached the fifth step and the fourth step, wouldn't he be the one in charge?At the current stage, what difference would it make if he said he was at the fifth step?It could only be said that in the eyes of outsiders, the stars formed by his core Dao, life and death, Nirvana, and revival had not reached the fifth stage on their own! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Li Hao was enlightened.Outsiders didn't look at you as a whole, but a part of you, the most prominent part.Of all Li Hao's great DAOs, the strongest was still the life, death, and Quietus star, which was only a level four great Dao. In fact, the other small realms did not even have the power of a level one Supreme Emperor great Dao.Therefore, they couldn't see the accumulation of the DAOs, and Li Hao hadn't formed a complete Dao net yet. These people could only see the strongest DAOs."I see!"Li Hao realized something else. In other words, even if a level nine venerable sovereign concealed his strongest great Dao, outsiders would only see the strength of his other great DAOs. If his opponent's second strongest great Dao was only level one, outsiders would only see it as a level one venerable sovereign."Interesting!"Li Hao laughed. If that's the case, if my life and death Star isn't strong enough, even if I have all my tools and don't build a real Dao net, these people will only see a level four venerable sovereign?It was a good way to naturally hide one's strength!Of course, ordinary people couldn't do it. Even if an ordinary person really cultivated a few more great DAOs, the effect wouldn't be as good as imagined. To stack the effect, he would need at least a few hundred great DAOs, right?Li Hao continued to comprehend the great Dao in delight.The shadow was lost in thought.‚Äã When Li Hao entered Tian Fang for the first time, what the mysterious man saw was only the continuous use of force to counter force. In fact, the mysterious man was very worried that Li Hao would walk into such a cycle. If that happened ... Something big would happen to him sooner or later, and he would die in the passage of time!However, this time, when Li Hao entered this place again ... He could not see much of time.

2987 Chapter 490
Li Hao seemed to have sealed time.Even if he didn 't, he didn't have much time on him. During this period of time, he didn't seem to use time very much. Even if he did, he didn't use it like before, where he kept borrowing power without restraint.Was it because he sensed danger, or did he change his mind and escape from time?The temptation of time was so great!Could he escape?"Think about it. You're just a first rank venerable sovereign, but you can even borrow the power of a seventh rank venerable sovereign ... You're infinitely expanding, and you have endless desires. If it were someone else, they might be thinking that I can borrow the power of a ninth rank venerable sovereign and unify the chaos!By then, would he still need to cultivate?Desire was very scary!Li Hao, on the other hand, might have gotten rid of this desire ... Ordinary desires could no longer restrain such a person. The Crimson Moon Lord of the Crimson Moon world, a rank eight venerable sovereign, must have an extremely strong Dao of desire.However, could his path of desire ... Really affect Li Hao?It affected a fellow who had been separated from time.Even if he was only a fourth stage venerable sovereign!Everyone had desires that could be restrained. This was the most terrifying thing.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"Still not coming out?"Wu Shan, however, was growing impatient.The Silver Moon King and Kong Ji had already been inside for seven days!These seven days had been very torturous for him. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  People kept probing him. In all directions, many Taoist connotation places were broken, but they still couldn't draw out the tianfang universe.And now, there were more and more seventh rank venerable sovereigns around.Many seventh rank venerable sovereigns had started to give up other Taoist connotation and set their eyes on the dark Demon Ridge.They didn't make a move, but from the start, they had been hiding. Now, someone had begun to test them.BOOM!The void fluctuated, and the power of the great path swept out. Wu Shan's face was cold. Without saying anything, he struck out with his hand, and the five Finger Mountain pressed down. He shouted coldly,"Qi Shui, do you want to die?"In the distance, a female venerable sovereign, who looked like a water god, showed her true appearance. She smiled gently and said,""Fellow Daoist Wushan, you misunderstand me. I saw that the fog around me was blocking everyone's vision, so I cleaned myself up. If fellow Daoist is unwilling, I can just give up. There's no need to do this ..."His words were gentle and soft, but Wu Shan was incomparably cold.This guy!These people were here to test the waters.It was already difficult for a level 8 great world like cloudsky to suppress them. It wasn't that they weren't afraid, but ... They weren't afraid of Wushan!Because there were more and more rumors recently.Wushan was ready to give up on Yunxiao and leave Yunxiao.Wushan knew who had spread the news. Who else could it be other than Yunxiao?Why so?This was the only way to make Wu Shan understand that without the backing of an eighth rank world, there was no powerful world behind him. Even if he was at the peak of the seventh rank, he had no power! Although you've put in a lot of effort all these years, don't forget who's your true source of confidence!If you want to leave, you can ... Think about it carefully.You're only at the seventh-rank, and there are many seventh-rank world Lords. Who would be afraid of you?Wu Shan understood what the cloud realm Lord was thinking.The more this was the case, the more impatient he was.So what if there was no cloud?If not for the fact that there were still people waiting in the dark Demon Ridge, he would not be afraid of these people at all. Even if someone dared to make a move, as long as he could kill one, the others would not dare to make a move at all!‚Äã He understood these guys too well.If he didn't care about the dark Demon Ridge, he would go and kill this woman now. The surrounding Level 7s would be extremely afraid. But now, he couldn't just leave like this, because if he left, someone would definitely enter the dark Demon Ridge!How hateful!They weren't done, were they?To go into seclusion for seven days at such a critical moment ... It's really asking for my life. We're only cooperating, not your Dao protector!He was a little unhappy!Last time, he had helped out once, but that was a cooperation. They had agreed that he would accept any danger.This time, it wasn't like this!This time, these two fellows thought that he was their Guardian, right?This Kong Ji fellow was even more detestable. His father was nearby, so why didn't he let his father come?Also, Silver Moon King, aren't you on the same side as the human King?The human King is also nearby, so why don't you ask the human King to protect you?Why me?Wu Shan was still in a rage. The auras of the experts around him were increasing, and his expression was unsightly. At this moment, not far away, a man stepped through the air. The deep sea Thearch no longer had complicated feelings, but a calm expression."Wushan, let Huilong take over the Huilong temple. This is his territory. Qi Shui's harassment is a provocation to me, Yunxiao. Today, you and I will work together to kill Qi Shui ... Since it's not convenient here, let's go outside the chaos!"Wushan didn't speak.Returning the Dragon to take over, leaving, deep sea helping him deal with Qi water ...It seemed like there was no problem, and Yunxiao even attached great importance to it.However ... Giving up on this place meant that he ... Had chosen to give up on escaping and return to the clouds.In the distance, venerable sovereign Qi Shui raised his eyebrows slightly and smiled. He wasn't too afraid.She understood what Deepsea meant.Was she afraid?He wasn't too afraid.Not to mention whether Wu Shan would leave or not, even if he did ... He had the guts to test her, so he naturally had some confidence. At this moment, she was very interested to see if Wu Shan would leave. Not only her, but many others were also watching.Wushan's departure meant that he would never leave Yunxiao again. Moreover, he had also given up on tianfang universe.Would he?Wu Shan gave the answer. He coldly looked around."If you think about it, it's easy. Kill me! I already said that the dark Demon Ridge has nothing to do with tianfang universe. If you don't believe me, then I can't do anything about it!"

"Since it has nothing to do with you, why are you still blocking us?" Thearch Qi Shui chuckled.Wushan didn't speak.Everyone was even more certain that this place was related to tianfang universe.The deep sea Thearch was no longer polite. At this moment, he was extremely profound."Wushan, if that's the case, why don't you hand over the dark Demon Ridge to me? Whoever you want to deal with, go ahead. Yun Xiao will escort you, and I will guard the dark Demon Ridge for you!"Wu Shan glanced at him, his eyes cold."Get the realm Lord to come personally!"Deepsea looked at him for a long time before she looked around."Everyone has seen Wushan's attitude. This matter has nothing to do with me, Yunxiao! I, Yunxiao, am willing to open the dark Demon Ridge to the public and even destroy it ... But now, the one who is stopping everyone is not me, Yunxiao!"He didn't say anything else. That was enough."Deepsea, you mean ... Wushan can't represent Yunxiao. At this moment, Wushan's attitude doesn't represent Yunxiao's attitude, right?""Yes!"Deepsea replied and disappeared immediately. It was as if she was telling the others that they could do whatever they wanted. I, cloudy heavens, don't care anymore!Wu Shan didn't mind, and only coldly looked at Qi Shui.He was once again a little angry. Why didn't these two bastards come out?"He's out ... It's best to take Dao Qi with him. If he takes Dao Qi away, the dark Demon Ridge won't matter. I'll give it my all. Even if I can't kill Qi Shui, I'll let this woman know what's called savagery!"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the dark Demon Ridge.Seven days passed by in a flash.At this moment, Kong Ji spat out a mouthful of blood and walked out from a pile of Dao. He coughed and shook his head. He looked at the illusionary figure and said with some regret, "I've overestimated myself!"" 6999 squares!""Unbelievable!" The mysterious man praised.The other party had tried to break through the 7000 squares several times but had failed. He had even suffered a backlash from the great Dao several times and had suffered quite serious injuries. Of course, to Kong Ji, the Dao of revival and the Dao of life could allow him to recover very quickly.  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  But he couldn't pass 7000 squares.This also meant that his comprehension of the Tao technique had not truly reached the seventh rank. There was still a gap to go before the seventh rank."It's a pity." He felt a little regretful."I have some comprehension of life and death, light and darkness, and Nirvana. However, it seems like I'm still short of the last breath. I can't completely merge them into one and step into the seventh rank in one go!"What a pity!7,000 cells was actually a type of grand fusion path!In this stage, he had tried to merge his two extreme Dao every time, but he had failed. This meant that he was still lacking something."It's already very powerful!"The shadow said,"it's true. Don't belittle yourself. In fact, some seventh level venerable sovereigns may not be able to reach this step. The seventh level beings from eighth level worlds, including some seventh level Lords, are like you. They can only reach the 6999th square.""The great fusion is actually a relatively difficult stage. Back then, there were people from all five paths who couldn't pass it."The mysterious man consoled him with a few words."Last time, you asked for 5000 slots in advance. Now, you've passed 6000 slots. You can make another request," he said.Kong Ji looked at Li Hao, who was still trying to pass the levels not far away."Let's wait for a while!"The shadow didn't say anything else.He also turned to look at Li Hao.5000 squares!This guy had been stuck at the 5000th square for a long time. As for Kong Ji, he was already breaking through 7000 cells.The gap was huge!However, Kong Ji frowned slightly." 5000 slots. It's the metal-elemental Dao. It's the strongest killing Dao among the five elemental DAOs. It's not too difficult ..."The mysterious man wanted to say the same thing.While he was speaking, the power of the five elements suddenly appeared on Li Hao's body. The next moment, a Tiger, a small tree, a sharp sword, a wave, and a huge mountain appeared on his body.Five elements as one!In an instant, the five elements fused, and five regions appeared, overlapping with five realms.He was silent and didn't say anything.Ëâπ!You're combining the five elements.No wonder he was so slow.BOOM!With a loud noise, the five elements combined into one and the five boundaries were superimposed. An aura of the peak of the fourth stage spread out. This also meant that under the combination of the five elements, Li Hao's realm was at the peak of the fourth stage in the eyes of outsiders.It was slightly stronger than the life and death, Nirvana, and recovery combined. Those were only Grade 4 and not at the peak.However, it was still not at the fifth step.Li Hao exhaled and stepped out of the chess board. He laughed."Interesting!"The five elements were united again!Of course, the fire element was still the strongest, and it was still mainly fire element.Li Hao looked at Kong Ji and asked, brother Kong Ji, have you finished?"No, 7000 cells, great fusion. I didn't pass!""Amazing! He's walking so fast!" Kong Ji was speechless. Was it powerful?Perhaps.Although this bastard only walked 5000 squares and gave up directly."You're not leaving?""I'm not leaving!"Li Hao laughed."It's been seven days, and no one has come to disturb us. That senior Wu Shan might still be outside protecting us. We can't go too far!" I've already gained a lot. I feel that this cultivation is equivalent to several years of my own comprehension!"Li Hao sighed and laughed.The harvest was not small!Everything was ready, the only thing lacking was money.Now, if you give me billions of great Dao crystals, there won't be any barriers. I can directly cross five levels in one step and combine 500 worlds into one. Tsk tsk ... I can blow up a level six!Li Hao laughed!From the aura, he was not much stronger. He had only stepped from the fourth rank to the peak of the fourth rank.But in fact, Li Hao had gained a lot this time."Senior, the dark Demon Ridge is no longer safe."

Chapter 2989 Exiting Seclusion (6)
Li Hao said,"I have 3000,4000, and 5000 slots. I can make one or three requests each. Am I right?""Yes,"The mysterious man nodded."First, senior, can we change the location of the game?" Li Hao asked.The mysterious man laughed,'change location? Where to?""If we're still in tianfang, the universe aura of the Dao chess won't leak out ... Right?""Yes,"Li Hao smiled."Then, senior, if you're interested, you can stay with me for now. I'll send you in after I open tianfang universe. How about it?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùGood Lord, I thought you wanted me to go with you, but you want me to stay in the godforsaken tianfang universe.The mysterious man thought for a while and nodded."Sure. It's within the rules. Since you're willing to make such a request, I'll naturally satisfy you!"Li Hao smiled."That's good. Second, I need you to teleport my brother to the Crimson Moon again."Good fellow!"What?" the mysterious man laughed."Is it only once for two people?""That can be considered two requests," Li Hao said with a smile.The mysterious man thought for a while."Forget it. Just one. It's the same whether it's one or two. However, I can only teleport you to the place we were at last time. I can't teleport you too close to the Crimson Moon. The Crimson Moon is also a level eight great world, and it will affect you."That's enough!Li Hao nodded.Since it was only a condition, Li Hao didn't hold back. He continued,""As for the third condition, senior, after you enter tianfang universe, help me conceal the Silvermoon world. Regardless of whether anyone enters ... Help me conceal it. With senior's ability as a level-eight great universe, it shouldn't be a problem, right?""Sure!"The mysterious man agreed without hesitation.Li Hao's three conditions weren't too difficult, but they were both very troublesome.Seeing that Li Hao's conditions didn't involve him, Kong Ji also said,""I can also make a request, senior. My request is much simpler. Give me a chance to teleport back ... Of course, I'm not limited to one person. One time is enough. I'll pay for the teleportation energy myself!"This was a backup plan."Sure!" The mysterious man nodded.Neither of them mentioned taking the path go with them. At this stage, they were still lacking. When they really reached the 7000th square and were confident of achieving the seventh rank, then taking the path go would be a matter of course.Teleport in and out, change of position, protect Silver Moon ...The four conditions were considered to have arranged a backup plan.What he had to do next was simple. He had to open tianfang universe.Li Hao looked at Dark Demon Ridge ... Borrowing the power of an eighth-stage powerhouse would definitely open tianfang universe. If he borrowed the power, the price would be extremely huge. Without borrowing the power, it would actually be very difficult for Li Hao at his current stage to open tianfang universe, as tianfang's power of inheritance was not enough.However, the price to pay for borrowing power was very high, and the secret agent might not be willing to borrow power.Li Hao pondered for a while and suddenly looked at the shadow.""Senior, can you lend me your strength once?"It's better to borrow chess than to borrow an agent.It was a level-eight great cosmos after all!It might not be weaker than the eighth-rank, and it was still alive. Of course, did Dao chess really have the strength of the eighth-rank?That might not be the case!Perhaps, it was not as good as before, but even if it was not as good as before, borrowing power was borrowing power from the past. In the past, at his peak, the power of Dao chess was at the eighth level, right?"You ... Borrowed power?" the mysterious man was stunned.Didn't he say that Li Hao had gotten rid of it?Li Hao explained,"I'm going to open a heaven universe, and by the way ... I'll cooperate with senior Wu Shan outside. I don't have to borrow the power of an eighth-level magician. Seventh-level magicians are enough ... I'm afraid I can't bear the eighth-level magicians, but seventh-level magicians are more than enough!" If it's level 7, it'll be easier for us to move around. It won't take too long, just one minute!"The Dao chess is still there, so there's room for discussion. There's no need to lend it to me all at once.Otherwise, the price would be too great.Just a little would do!One minute was more than enough. "To be honest, I don't even have the power of the seventh step to lend you ... Of course, if you use time to go back in time, it's still possible!" "However, the price is not small. Even if it's only the power of the seventh step, even if it's only for a minute, you'll have to pay a great price. Of course, as the main body borrowing the power, I won't ask for too much from you. But as for the price of time power ... I've thought about it, perhaps you'll need to help me recover my full strength!"Li Hao was startled."Is it difficult?"The shadow fell silent for a moment before nodding."It's not too difficult. It's just ... Annexing an eighth-tier great cosmos!" To make up for my deficit ..."Was it difficult?It wasn't too difficult!This was called human speech?That's right, the other party wasn't human to begin with.He had only borrowed the power of a seventh-stage creature for one minute, but Li Hao had to pay the price of an eighth-stage great cosmos and a seventh-stage lightning bolt. Even if he could block it this time, it would come again.At this moment, Kong Ji couldn't help but take a deep breath."The cost of using the power of time is too great! If it's only rank seven power for one minute, even if I hire a rank seven venerable sovereign for a year, I can't ask for an rank eight great world!""Even if I were to hire an eighth-grade one, it wouldn't be that expensive. I'll pay you the world you control just for one hire?The eighth-grade one can give you a massage every day!The mysterious man sighed,'this is the price of time, a hundred times or a thousand times! "Therefore, you'll have to pay a huge price when you meet those people in the future. Fortunately, the strongest one you've borrowed is only at the pseudo seventh rank! It should be a little easier than a great Dao universe ..."The effort and gain were not proportional.But for Li Hao, even if it was not proportional, he had no choice but to do so.At this time, Kong Ji shook his head."Forget it, Haoyue. It's just a minute. If you need it, I can find uncle yaoyang or my father. Even if you go to the human King, you don't need to pay such a huge price!"It was too terrifying!"A level 8 great world? what we're planning isn't a level 8 great world. We're only planning on their storage. It's not enough even if we work for you. We'll have to pay you.Li Hao was also helpless. The price was too great!After much consideration, Li Hao nodded and said,""Alright!" The mysterious man was startled. 'You agree?'Kong Ji was also speechless. Why?  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  Li Hao laughed and said,"it's not bad to borrow it for free!."Borrowing it for free?The mysterious man was a bit absent-minded, but Li Hao smiled.""Even if senior didn't say it, if there was a chance, senior could help me a few times, and I would naturally find a way to help senior recover. Now, it's equivalent to borrowing strength for nothing, so I won't take the initiative to help senior recover again ... Isn't this a free profit?"The shadow was stunned for a while and didn't say anything.Kong Ji thought about it and felt that it made sense.That's true!In other words, the price he had to pay for borrowing the power of the seventh step for one minute was only one lightning tribulation. This wasn't a big problem.Would Li Hao help Dao Qi recover?As long as the opportunity was right, they should. After all, the path of chess had helped them many times. Even if Li Hao had asked Kong Ji to obtain the path of chess ... It was only obtaining, not destroying. The path of chess was a weapon to begin with.Kong Ji turned his head and thought,"Dao chess has been restored. Li Hao's original intention was for me to be in charge of Dao chess. Does that mean that he's working for me this time?"Thinking about it, Kong Ji also smiled.So, in the end, I'm the one who earned it?It seemed ... Rather embarrassing!Li Hao glanced at him. What are you laughing at?She turned around and roughly understood his thoughts. She smiled and looked at the illusory figure."By the way, senior, brother Kongtong wants to go through 7000 squares and asked you to follow him. I've only gone through 5000 squares, so it looks like my chances aren't as high as brother Kongtong's ... Senior, you and brother Kongtong will be family from now on!"Kong Ji didn't say anything, but the shadow was a little depressed.""We'll see!"...""What did that mean?Didn't you say that I can take you away after 7000 cells?What did he mean by 'let's talk about it'?The shadow didn't say a word. With a time cultivator here, I don't really ... Like you, a cultivator of the six paths and three extremes. What should I do?If it was another time, you're actually quite good!
