        Chapter 216: Origin god weapon (4)
        Translator: 549690339
        “But now, elder Yuan has to go. Even if we promise not to let him go, the other organizations also want him to go, because he knows that ancient site very well.”
        
        “Three years ago, the night patrolmen investigated once, but they suffered heavy losses. Three sunlit experts and many Dark Moon experts died.”
        
        “At that time, elder Yuan was also badly injured ... In the past few years, the night patrollers and other organizations have also investigated and the results are that they have all suffered great losses. Therefore, as the person involved, it is necessary for elder Yuan to go. However, he was able to kill three suns, so everyone needs more time to prepare.”
        
        Li Hao finally understood.
        
        “They’ve been talking about the various organizations. Are they Red Moon, flying heavens, and Yama?”
        
        “More than that!”
        
        Li Meng explained again,”the three major organizations are the three most powerful organizations in the field of superpower!” All sorts of small superpower organizations also spring up like mushrooms after the rain. Every year, some emerge, some are destroyed, and some grow stronger!”
        
        “The night patrollers and the three major organizations are the first level in the field of superpowers. There are still some weaker ones.”
        
        “It’s so chaotic?”
        
        As soon as Li Hao finished speaking, he stepped on the brakes, and the inertia almost sent them flying. Fortunately, they were all supers and could still stabilize themselves. However, they were all speechless. This guy almost drove into the river!
        
        Li Hao didn’t take it seriously. He became interested and continued to drive. He asked,””Sister li, the night patrolman didn’t care at all? They either kill them to establish their might or recruit them. Why are there so many organizations popping up?”
        
        Li Meng didn’t say anything, so Wang Ming impatiently said,”How can it be that simple! Supers are trained and easy to deal with. Some God-favored priests were supers from the beginning and improved at a terrifying speed, even faster than us night watchers ... You didn’t even notice him, and he became a sun glory or even three suns! They didn’t break the law, and just because they are supers, we have to pay the price and kill them?”
        
        As he said that, he added,”as for the enlistment ... There is one too!” However, there were some supers who were not willing to accept it, so what could they do? The world is so big, if you catch him, he’ll run away. If you force him to join, you’ll be disloyal and it’ll be more troublesome. ”
        
        At the end of his sentence, he sighed.”The key is that the night patrolmen lack the attraction to supers!” The three major organizations are more attractive to them than the night patrollers!”
        
        “Why?”
        
        Li Hao was curious. Was the official endorsement not as popular as the three major organizations?
        
        This was also something that he could not understand.
        
        The government had all the advantages. When they first rose up, they even had firearms as a deterrent. However, they did not have as many experts as the three major organizations. How useless were they?
        
        “AI!”
        
        Wang Ming sighed. Li mengxin was straightforward and a little unwilling, so she directly said, “It’s all because of the mysterious energy! The founders of the three major organizations have been superpowers for an even longer time. They have accumulated in secret and seem to have occupied a few large ruins or other things ... Anyway, they can produce large amounts of mysterious energy. ”
        
        “As for the night patrollers, they started a little late and missed the best opportunity. They didn’t manage to occupy some of the ruins that produced mysterious energy, nor did they obtain any important treasures. Even if there were any that could absorb mysterious energy, there were very few of them.”
        
        She was also a little dejected.”Say, how can they not be as mysterious as them? how attractive can they be to supers?” Right now, the central region is in chaos because of this. The night patrollers are the main force of the chaos!”
        
        Wang Ming coughed lightly.
        
        Li Meng disagreed,”that’s true!” The Nightwalker’s headquarters ... Not just in Silver Moon province, but also the central headquarters. Some powerhouses were not willing to be controlled by the three major organizations, so they secretly annihilated some small organizations and seized some relics and supernatural items that produced mysterious powers. “In the end, they were discovered. They did not do it very discreetly. Now, the three major organizations have launched an attack and are fighting in the central area. They are forcing the night patrolmen to hand over the murderer. In addition, some people are taking advantage of the situation. It’s almost a pot of porridge over there!”
        
        “Because of this, places like silver Moon province are very low-key. The night patrollers usually don’t dare to cause trouble rashly because they’re worried that the surrounding areas will be in complete chaos again. Furthermore, the central area won’t be of much help to us. It’s already good enough for those people to hold back the three major organizations and those chaotic organizations.”
        
        At this moment, Li Hao was a little surprised.
        
        “You’re saying that in the central region, the night patrollers went to snatch these things ... And then ... They were beaten up?”
        
        “En!”
        
        Although it didn’t sound nice to say this, Li Meng couldn’t help but laugh.”What you said isn’t wrong, they were beaten up by a group of people! I’ve heard that the powerhouses above the three suns have fought several times! “The night patrolman’s family can’t beat all of them ... However, they’ve also gone crazy this time. They even fired several city-destroying bombs. Of course, many people died. Anyway, both sides are afraid of each other, so it’s very chaotic over there now.”
        
        Li Hao suddenly laughed.”Interesting. So, the night patrollers are considered powerful in the central area?”
        
        He actually dared to exterminate the entire sect and steal their treasures!
        
        Before this, he thought that the night patrollers were all very useless ... Cough, cough, they were all very helpless.
        
        For example, Silver Moon province had to give up some cities.
        
        In the end, they started fighting?
        
        And it was the night patrolman who started it!
        
        It was unexpected.
        
        Seeing that Li Meng had said what he shouldn’t have, Wang Ming could only say, “It’s alright! Actually, this matter ... Was not pleasant to hear. It wasn’t as if they were going to go out of their way to fight with the large organizations. After all, everyone would suffer great losses in a fight. It was mainly because a few young god tier Masters were not afraid of anything and felt that being mysterious was not enough, so they secretly joined forces and found a small organization to directly exterminate the entire family and steal the treasures!”

        Chapter 217: Origin god weapon (5)
Translator: 549690339
“At first, no one knew about it. Later, it was exposed. But now that things have come to this, no one can back down, so they started fighting.”

“It was like a powder keg and almost exploded. This was the fuse that ignited the central region.”

Wang Ming sighed with emotion, then shook his head.”Those god tier Masters aren’t easy to deal with! I heard that the two sides were still negotiating and didn’t start fighting at the beginning. Those guys killed the grandson of the Yama leader and took away an important treasure! This time, the Yama was completely enraged, and he didn’t even want to negotiate ...”

Li Hao was a little dazed,’these few ... Are so fierce? Don’t tell me you have ulterior motives and are deliberately starting a war?”

“I don’t know. I don’t think so. Even if ... It’s not a big problem.”

Wang Ming laughed dryly,”I heard that treasure is extremely important!” The Yama’s grandson had only secretly taken it out to show off. In the end, he was killed by them and handed it directly to the Nightwalker headquarters. In the end, when a few important figures in the headquarters obtained the treasure, they couldn’t hold it in and started fighting immediately! He had heard from Huang zhuncheng that the treasure could produce a large amount of mysterious energy! It might even have a special mysterious energy that can help identify a person’s physique!”

Li Hao was somewhat surprised. Strengthen his Constitution?

What did that mean?

Wang Ming explained again,”that is to say, if I use it on you, I can find out which type of mysterious energy you’re matched with, and it’ll directly guide you to it, so that your success rate of advancing to super is as high as ninety percent!” This isn’t just an ordinary high level. You have to know that we’re all randomly guiding them now. Whether or not they succeed is all random. ”

“How can there be so many mysteries to waste!”

“If this thing is useful, then with 10 people guiding and 9 succeed...The night patrolman’s strength will definitely soar! On one hand, we have a large population. On the other hand, we’re more stable internally and have a sufficient selection system. We can choose the best among the best. ”

“In the past, the three great organizations were powerful probably because of this. They were able to identify the type of body constitution that was suitable for cultivating mysterious energy, and they could succeed by directly guiding it ... Don’t you think this is a valuable treasure?”

Li Hao took a deep breath and nodded. Treasure!

The night patrolmen were left behind probably because they lacked this.

If he were a big figure on the night patrol, he would definitely not return the items at this time. At most, he would start a war. Even if he lost some soldiers, he would still fight. Anyway, he would not give them the items!

No wonder the central region was said to be on the verge of destruction.

At this moment, Li Hao felt that he had learned something new. He had suddenly understood the core of the central continent’s chaos.

Sure enough, these people from white moon City knew a lot. Even Yuan Shuo didn’t know about this, let alone Liu Long, but Wang Ming, a mere Yue Ming, knew everything.

“Then ... The treasure is still in the hands of the night patrolmen?”

“Of course. Otherwise, the war would have stopped long ago.”

Wang Ming laughed.”It’s a crazy fight over there anyway. But ... There’s an advantage to chaos!”

Wang Ming sighed with emotion.”I heard that there’s too much fighting over there, and they’re improving very quickly. Originally, there were very few people above three suns, but I heard that someone recently advanced again, and he’s still young. “All the large organizations have joined the battle. The three large organizations are trying to stop the night patrollers from growing stronger. The small and medium-sized organizations are hoping to take the treasure away. They also want a share of the loot. Once they get their hands on the treasure, they can identify the physique and strengthen themselves. However, they can compete with the large organizations!”

That was why the central region had attracted too many supers.

The more battles there were, the more opportunities there would be. Many people had advanced, and there were many people dying every day.

Anyway, there were people advancing and becoming supers every day.

Hu Hao, who hadn’t said much all this time, suddenly said,””It’s best if the war doesn’t stop so soon. Otherwise ... I’m afraid Minister li and professor Yuan will be in trouble!”

The Crimson Moon expert didn’t have time to deal with them now, because it was really difficult to mobilize more experts.

However, once the war in the central region was over, Yuan Shuo would not be able to stop them in the small silver Moon province.

Li Hao, however, didn’t care too much. He smiled and said,””It’s fine if they come. Our Silver City branch isn’t weak!”

“……”

The few of them ignored him.

He didn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!

Do you think you can fight the Crimson Moon just because you broke through a hundred nether barriers in a few months?

You must be joking.

This guy really doesn’t understand the cruelty of the supernatural realm.

Li Hao, on the other hand, was satisfied.

He had gathered a lot of information in an instant.

Even if the next rainy season came, they might not be able to dispatch a large number of Masters to attack because the central region was holding them back. They could not escape easily.

If there were too few of them, perhaps they could be slaughtered and eaten one by one.

As for the central region ... Li Hao didn’t want to go there to die at all.

Didn’t you hear what they said?

The three suns and above were constantly fighting, and some of them even died. It was too terrifying. Even if the teacher went there, he would die.

However, Li Hao was very interested in the so-called treasures and relics that could give birth to mysterious energy.

He was wondering if his small sword could also continuously produce special mysterious energy.

Or was it completely gone after it was done?

Thinking of this, Li Hao suddenly asked, right, are those mysterious energies infinite? For example, after some treasures have absorbed all the mysterious energy, can they continue to be born?”

Wang Ming explained,”all the large organizations have ways to solve this problem. They can even convert some things to produce mysterious energy, or fill it up. In any case, treasures are needed as intermediary objects! These treasures had a special name in the superpower realm, the misty origin divine weapon! Any organization that has an origin weapon is worth paying attention to. It means that they can continuously give birth to new supers!”

Chapter 218: Origin god weapon (6)
Translator: 549690339
An origin divine weapon!

It could be replenished, it could be converted ...

At this moment, Li Hao’s heart stirred.

Why did he feel that the weapons of the eight great families were all origin divine weapons?

No way!

The eight great families might have eight weapons, but of course, they might not. After all, in the folk songs, there were some people who didn’t use weapons.

If it was an origin god weapon, eight pieces at once ...

Hiss!

“Then ... Was the sword I gave you last time an origin divine weapon?” Li Hao asked tentatively.

Wang Ming couldn’t help laughing,”how’s that possible?” It’s not that easy to get an origin god weapon, but ... I’m not sure about your sword’s sealed state. If it’s really an origin god weapon ... Then it’ll be terrifying. I don’t know how many origin God weapons Hongyue has taken away. If so ... I hope it’s not. Otherwise, it’ll be too terrifying if Hongyue’s power rises sharply. ”

Li Hao felt that it was possible.

An origin divine weapon!

In this case, the eight great families really weren’t simple in ancient times.

Every family had inherited an origin divine weapon, which was the foundation for the establishment of a large organization. Without an origin divine weapon, without a stable source of mysterious energy, how could they last long by only killing people and snatching their mysterious energy?

For example, the demon-hunting team relied on killing people to steal their treasures. If not for Yuan Shuo’s participation this time, they would have been completely annihilated.

At this moment, he remembered the words ‘origin divine weapon’.

Then, he thought of the special energy in the small sword that was getting lesser and lesser. How could he replenish it?

This kind of energy was too useful.

Li Hao’s heart ached when it was used up.

“Old Wang, are there any origin divine weapons in the other branches?”

“You’re joking! In the entire Silver Moon province, only Whitemoon city has night patrollers, so every year, a batch of supers is born. We are all supers born from that origin god weapon. ”

Wang Ming explained a little more.”That’s why powerhouses keep watch in Whitemoon city all year round. Minister hou doesn’t leave the headquarters all year round. He’s always there to prevent the origin divine weapon from being seized.”

The Minister hou he was talking about was the No. 1 Nightwalker of Silvermoon province, the real boss.

A clear three-sun powerhouse!

At this time, Li Meng also interjected,””Origin God weapons can not only produce mysterious energy. As far as I know, they can also produce some special mysterious energy. I’m not sure how special it is, but I heard from some seniors that when superpowers first appeared, some people didn’t know how precious special mysterious energy was and directly absorbed the mysterious source in the origin god weapon ... It was too wasteful and extravagant! However, the effect seems to be super good. Many of the solar and three sun Espers actually absorbed the energy back then. ”

Energy!

Li Hao’s expression didn’t change, but he was shocked again.

The energy I absorbed ... Sword energy, saber energy, could it be the so-called Origin Energy?

Origin divine weapons gave birth to a special mysterious energy. Why did he feel that his sword was an origin divine weapon?

Wang Ming also ridiculed,”the older generation of supers have no knowledge and are just messing around!” No one is doing such a thing now unless everyone has one. Otherwise, origin God weapons are the prerequisite for the birth of a large organization. Who would blindly make one?”

Li Hao thought of his teacher. Did his teacher ... Not know about this?

He had thought that his teacher knew everything.

If he had known, his teacher would have guessed that the swords and sabers might all be origin God weapons.

“The origin god weapon ... Does everyone know about it?”

“How could that be? in the past, no one knew about it. In Silver Moon province, only Minister hou knew about it. Later on, during the war in the central region, the news of that treasure spread, and only then did people know about it. Only then did we know about the existence of the origin god weapon.”

Li Hao nodded. He understood now. Perhaps his teacher really didn’t know about it before. When the news spread, his teacher stayed in the Silver City all the time, so he didn’t know much. The night patrolmen wouldn’t tell him everything.

Li Hao was overjoyed. There were also things that his teacher didn’t know, and he had to tell him later.

An origin divine weapon!

He and his teacher each had one.

He just didn’t know how to produce an infinite amount of mysterious energy. Or rather, what Li Hao needed wasn’t this, but how to endlessly replenish his special sword energy and saber energy.

Once he had an idea, there would be a way to solve it.

Thinking of this, Li Hao was even more delighted.

With a loud bang, Li Hao’s train of thought was interrupted. The car had crashed!

Wang Ming sighed, and so did Li Meng and Hu Hao.

He should have expected this!

I shouldn’t have talked to this guy. Now, it’s better to let Hu Hao fly with me.

Li Hao was a little embarrassed. He got out of the car to take a look, then quickly got back in. “It’s fine, I hit a stone block, I can still drive!”

After saying that, he restarted the car and continued driving.

……

When they arrived at the entrance of his small courtyard, the three superhumans stepped out of the car, their legs shaking.

The car that Li Hao had just picked up was also in a mess.

Li Hao sighed. My car!

He was destined to never be rich in this life.

Look, this was such a good car. If they were to repair it ... Li Hao suspected that he wouldn’t be able to afford it if he didn’t pay him.

……

Li Hao was a little uneasy during dinner.

They thought that Li Hao’s heart ached for the car, but Li Hao actually didn’t have any. Even if he did, it would only be a small portion. He was more concerned about the origin divine weapon and the eight great families.

The origin divine weapon of the eight great families.

If Hong Yue had known that they could still use the weapons of the eight great families, she would not have given up.

Even if they didn’t mention the eight trigrams diagram above the Silver City, just an origin god weapon was enough to make them unwilling to give up.

One should know that the central region was almost willing to fight to the death for an origin god weapon.

Now, the red moon did not make a large-scale move, perhaps because she was worried that other people would be attracted.

“In that case, I have to be more careful. They want to kill me not just for gossip, but also for weapons ... I hope the sword from the night patrolmen can be hidden from them for a while.”

……

While Li Hao and the others were eating.

White moon City.

“How dare you!” He shouted, his voice reverberating in all directions. You’re looking for death!”

A loud boom rang out.

A moment later, a group of people quickly gathered in front of an important warehouse. An expert with shoulder-length hair looked around with a cold face. After a long time, he said,””Go back, it’s fine!”

Everyone left.

After they had left, the man looked at Hao lianchuan, who was not far away, and said in an icy voice,””There doesn’t seem to be any precious treasure here ... Only the sword you brought back from the Silver City!”

This was the night patrolman’s Silvermoon province headquarters!

The other party actually dared to come here.

He was too bold!

“Minister hou, Is He Dead?” Hao lianchuan asked in a low voice.

“He ran away!”

Hearing this, Hao lianchuan’s expression changed. He ran away in front of the Marquis?

“An earth element expert!”

The man coldly said,”eight great families ... Weapons ... Crimson Moon ... They may not be from Crimson Moon, but it seems that many people are paying attention to the eight great families” weapons. ” You have to pay attention to the Silver City. Now that they are separated, they might not send too powerful existences there, but ... Once Yuan Shuo leaves, it’s best to bring Li Hao to white moon City. Otherwise, some people won’t be content with their place. ”

“Understood!”

Hao lianchuan nodded and could not help but ask,””Eight great families ... What’s the situation?”

“It’s hard to say. It’s been too long. We can’t dig out all the secrets. ”

The man sighed,”that Hong Yue leader, Ying Hong Yue, might have obtained some ancient books related to the eight great families. In short, you just have to keep a close eye on her!” Also, that Li Hao...Give him more attention!”

After saying that, he suddenly said coldly,””If these people don’t give up, maybe ... We can use this opportunity to get rid of some of the rioters.”

Hao lianchuan nodded.

The opportunity was right, but he was afraid that ... The night patrolman was not strong enough to take this sweet potato.

“Also, tell Yuan Shuo that the relic exploration is scheduled for the end of next month.”

“I know.”

Hao lianchuan turned around and left. When he reached the door, he suddenly turned around and asked,””Hou bu, can you transfer more experts from the central region to assist?”

“No!”

The man shook his head.”That’s impossible. They can’t hold on any longer. They’ve asked me to go and help them several times with the origin god weapon, but I refused. As for Silver Moon province, if I leave, I’m afraid you won’t be able to hold on.”

“AI!”

With a sigh, Hao lianchuan left, feeling a little helpless.

Both sides were in a tight spot!

Otherwise, more people would have gone to explore the ruins instead of only him, the three suns, leading the team. This exploration might not have been very safe.

Chapter 219: Blizzard Silver city’s dark wave (1)
Translator: 549690339
It was the second day after the night patrolman division was established.

Li Hao rode his broken bicycle again. He had no choice. The collision yesterday was unsightly, and he couldn’t even light the ignition this morning. Li Hao was so angry that he almost smashed this broken bicycle.

It was not useful at all!

The new house was some distance away from the inspection Office, further than the old house. It would probably take half an hour by bike.

However, Li Hao’s cultivation had already surpassed a hundred, so he wouldn’t feel tired.

On the bluestone path in front of the gate, Li Hao was riding his bicycle leisurely.

A moment later, a luxury car drove over on the road of the neighborhood next to the trail.

It was much more luxurious than Li Hao’s car.

Li Hao didn’t turn his head. Instead, the window of the luxury car next to him rolled down, revealing the face of the man who had a conflict with Liu Yan yesterday. He had a faint smile on his face and looked very gentle.

Of course, he wasn’t as calm when he was handcuffed by Liu Yan yesterday.

“Little brother, do you still remember me?”

Li Hao turned his head and looked at him. He nodded slightly.”I remember. President Qiao from Qiao’s mining company. Sister Liu told me about it.”

“Go to work?”

“Yes,”

Li Hao’s expression was calm, and he didn’t really want to talk to him.

“Ride a bike? Do you want to take my car?”

Qiao Peng seemed to be very angry as he laughed,”I was just playing around with Liu Yan yesterday. I have to go to the patrol office to settle some matters. How long will it take you to ride? come on.”

“No need!”

Li Hao politely refused.”Sister Liu said that her husband was killed by the security Captain of your Qiao’s mining company ... Stay away from me. Otherwise, I’m afraid I can’t help but arrest you!”

Qiao Peng raised his brows and quickly sighed,””This was really an accident. I’ve actually been trying to make up for it all these years. To put it bluntly, I pursued Liu Yan to make up for everything ... Otherwise, with my status, there’s no woman I can’t get. Little brother, you don’t understand. She was hurt too deeply, so I should give her a sense of security. And I ... Can heal her wounds.”

Frowning, Li Hao ignored him and continued riding.

In his heart, he was thinking, are you acting with me?

Everyone was about the same!

He was also acting half-truthfully. It was said that this guy in front of him might be related to the Yama, so there was no need to completely fall out and offend him in one go.

Also, this guy came to chat with him for no reason ...

Was it because of the eight great families?

Just because he was the successor of the eight great families, this guy wanted to take the opportunity to get close to him?

Seeing that Li Hao was ignoring him, Qiao Peng smiled,””Forget it. Perhaps you don’t understand. You’ll understand when you’re older. Young people don’t understand these things. We’ll be neighbors in the future. You can come over to my place when you have time.”

As for why Li Hao could live here, he didn’t have any doubts. It was easy for a night patrol to find a good place.

Furthermore, he had received news that the fellow before him had actually become the Deputy Minister ... This was not too surprising. After all, Yuan Shuo was still around.

The luxury car gradually drove away.

Li Hao looked at it for a while, then stopped. He rode his little cart and continued to rush toward the inspection Office.

Qiao Peng!

He remembered this name.

Perhaps this guy had even dug up his own ancestral grave.

……

At the law enforcement building.

It had now become a branch of the night patrollers.

Up until now, there were only nine official members in the night patrollers ‘branch. But other than them, Li Hao had recruited ten people from the inspector Bureau to join them. They were mainly in charge of daily and logistics work.

Today, the night patrolmen were officially open for business.

Li Hao had his own office in this building.

A silk banner was hung in the office.

Li Hao was a man of his word. He really took the pennant that Zhou He had given him and hung it as a merit.

This was the first silk banner he had received in his life, so he had to pay attention to it.

Besides, Zhou He had given him a house, a car, battle experience, and even his life ... No matter what, Li Hao should remember his good deeds.

Just as he entered the office, Liu Yan knocked on the door. Without waiting for a reply, she pushed the door open and entered. “Let’s go. Stop looking at your banner. The boss is calling for a meeting!”

“A meeting this early?”

“Boss is very efficient!”

Liu Yan smiled and looked at Li Hao.””Did you sleep well last night? Are you scared?”

“I’m not afraid. ”

Li Hao hurriedly shook his head. I don’t dare to say that I’m afraid. If I’m afraid, are you going to move there?

That would be terrifying!

The two of them walked and chatted as they headed upstairs to the conference room.

……

In the conference room.

When Li Hao arrived, almost everyone else had arrived as well, with Wang Ming right after him.

As soon as everyone sat down, Liu Long entered the meeting room with a gust of wind.

He didn’t sit down and went straight to the point.”The Silver City’s night patrol Division has been established. Since Dou Qian is still in charge of the Silver City, we should do what we need to do immediately!”

“I’ll make a long story short!”

“In Silver City, there was no official superpower organization,” Liu Long said in a deep voice. “The inspection Division has always been in charge of the city’s security system! We don’t have any troops here, and the inspection Division is the largest and only law enforcement agency!”

“However, it’s impossible for a city with a population of a million people to be filled with ordinary people. There are martial masters and supers in Silver City ... It seems that there are not many dark moons, but there are Starlight Masters!”

After saying that, he added,”in Silver City, there are a few places that we need to pay attention to!” First, the ancient academy of Silver City. Li Hao was well aware of this. Second, Silver city’s Administration Department will be in charge of the People’s livelihood. It will not interfere with the inspector’s office. ”

Chapter 220: Blizzard Silver city’s dark wave (2)
Translator: 549690339
The Silver City’s Administration Department was in charge of other matters besides military force. The entire Silver City was stable not only because of the law enforcement Inspector, but also because of the assistance of other departments.

The Silver City’s Administration Department and the inspection Division didn’t belong to the same system, but they were both official systems. The two sides didn’t interfere with each other, neither did they involve themselves in politics.

“Third, there are 18 dojos in Silver City. I’m talking about dojos that are opened by official martial masters!”

“Fourth, Silver city’s six major corporations!”

“These places are more or less filled with martial masters and supers,” Liu Long said in a deep voice.”Some of them work for the major forces, while others are the founders. These people are the main source of the instability of the entire Silver City!”

As for the inspection Office, there were also martial masters. Liu Long and the others were martial masters, and mu Sen also had martial masters.

As for supers, there were none ... Even if there were, the inspection Office would send them directly to the night patrollers, unless they were unwilling to join the night patrollers. However, almost no one would be unwilling to join the inspection Office when they became supers.

This also led to a special situation. There might be a few supers in other places, but the inspector’s office did not have one.

Of course, he had one now, and it was more than one.

Everyone looked at each other. Wang Ming had had dinner with Liu Long yesterday, so he was willing to say a few more words today.”Chief Liu, what do you mean?”

“Clean up, comb!”

Liu Long was straightforward,”in the past, the inspection Office didn’t have enough authority and strength, so they let some people go!” Now that the Nightwatchers have been established, we must let all the major forces in Silver City know that Silver City is still under the government’s rule!”

Wang Ming didn’t say anything else.

Li Hao, on the other hand, said,”boss, what goal do we need to achieve?” Establish our might?”

Li Hao chuckled.”If it’s just to show off their might, boss’s previous attack had already done the same. It’s impossible that they don’t know that boss killed three supers!”

It was just to establish his might, so there was actually not much need for that.

Liu Long said in a deep voice,”it’s not just to establish our might, there’s also ... A portion of our forces that are hiding and accepting evil!” We didn’t have the power to clean them up before, but now that we’ve become night patrols, we have the right to clean up these parasites!”

After saying that, he said bluntly,”there’s one more thing, to earn some extra money!” “Killing supers who have broken the law and seizing their mysterious powers is also an important source. Otherwise, if we count on the higher-ups to allocate funds, the Nightwalker headquarters will only give us a quota of 10 cubic meters every month! 3 squadrons for City Patrol, 1 squadrons for inspector, and half a squadrons for patrol. You can distribute the extra. ”

The night patrolman team consisted of nine people, one city patroller, three investigators-Li Hao, Liu Yan, and Wang Ming were all investigators. The others, including the two supers, were only level one investigators.

According to the above salary, 8.5 cubic meters a month was enough. 10 cubic meters was not a small amount.

In terms of money, Li Hao’s monthly salary could reach a million!

Of course, that was a black market.

In any case, the benefits of giving one cube of mysterious energy a month were actually quite a lot. This was also one of the reasons why countless people were so eager to become night watchers.

However, to Liu Long, it was too little.

Three cubic meters. In the past, he felt that it was still okay, and it was a stable income. 36 cubic meters a year was already a lot.

But now, he felt that it was not enough.

This was because everyone had become stronger. For someone like Liu Yan, who only had one party a month, it was not enough for her. As a Martial Master with over a hundred martial masters, it was difficult for her to even strengthen her body with such a small amount of mysterious energy, let alone advance to a super.

Therefore, he needed more mysterious energy.

Wang Ming and the others ‘expressions changed slightly at such an undisguised statement.

Liu Long directly said that killing people to steal their mysterious energy. This ... Was too brutal. Were all the local powerhouses like this?

Li Hao didn’t care about this. He thought for a while and said,””It’s easy for everyone to be in danger this way! The night patrollers are not invincible. Once we force some supers to join the arms of other hostile superpower organizations, we will be considered to have done the wrong thing. ”

Liu Long frowned.

In the past, he had the final say. What did Li Hao mean by this? was he going to reject his suggestion?

To be honest, he was only here to make an announcement, and everyone just had to follow his instructions. He didn’t like people to contradict him. He was used to this style, not even Li Hao.

Li Hao seemed to know that Liu Long was not satisfied. He bared his teeth and revealed an innocent smile. “Boss’s main goal is to ensure the Silver City’s peace and stability. At least, there won’t be any internal problems.”

Liu Long slightly nodded.

“That’s why I think we should use peaceful means before resorting to force!”

Li Hao suggested,”first, send out notices and official letters to all the official martial masters and supers in the city. Invite them to meet with the night patrollers. Report to them and give them special passes!” With the special qualification pass we issued, you can move freely in the city. Because of their destructive power, we have to pay special attention to them. People who don’t cause trouble won’t mind. ”

“I took a look, and white moon City seems to be doing this too, right?”

Li Hao looked at Wang Ming, who nodded slightly.”Yes, but there are many experts in the White moon City. As long as some experts don’t go too far, the night patrollers won’t care too much. It’s fine as long as they don’t cause trouble in the city.”

Li Hao laughed,”this shows that this measure is very appropriate!” To establish order for the supers! It’s just that Silver City was too small before, and there was no official organization, so it hasn’t been implemented in Silver City. This time, I suggest that we officially implement it!”

Chapter 221: Blizzard Silver city’s dark wave (3)
Translator: 549690339
Liu Long looked at him and was silent for a moment before saying,””Continue!”

“Those who have reported and have a qualified pass are legal and compliant. Those who don’t ... Are stowaways and people with ulterior motives. Only then do we have a legitimate reason to enforce the law!”

Liu Long frowned,”take off your pants and fart!” Of course, I’m not saying that it’s not good, but I don’t think it’s necessary!”

Li Hao laughed.”Boss, we’re government officials, not members of those supernatural organizations outside. We still have to stand on the moral high ground and the high ground of the law to carry out the ruling and trial. We can’t treat ourselves as supers in the wild!”

Liu Long’s style was like this, somewhat rough.

It wasn’t a big problem in the past, because the demon hunting squad was just a supernumerary organization in the past. But it was different now, everyone was a regular army.

Then he couldn’t do that!

Having studied at the ancient academy for a few years and under Yuan Shuo’s tutelage, Li Hao was well aware that sometimes, one could avoid a lot of trouble by following the law.

He stood on the high ground and made the judgment!

He didn’t want to be caught by others ... After all, the Silver City’s strength was average, and they needed the support of their superiors. It wasn’t an independent kingdom, so they could do whatever they wanted.

The Silver City and the White moon City were not completely separated. Some of the big shots in the Silver City could also get in touch with the White moon City.

“Also, I believe that most people still have justice in their hearts!”

Li Hao continued,’boss means to directly charge at the door and kill! It’s too bloody and violent, and it’s easy to make the people of the Silver City panic. I don’t think it’s the right time now. We can use the other’s strength to fight, and we don’t have to do it ourselves. ”

He didn’t make a move?

Liu Long looked at Li Hao again, and Li Hao explained,””For example, there are martial masters and even supers in the administration department, and there are also supers in the ancient academy ... Strictly speaking, these forces are all in the same camp! There’s a rule for the night patrolmen. In any area where there are night patrolmen, all the supers and martial masters are under the night patrolmen’s command. We can borrow martial masters and supers from all over the world to join forces to suppress those offenders!”

“This way, we can share some of the pressure. It won’t be all concentrated on us.”

“Otherwise, it’s very easy to attract the resistance of the entire Silver city’s extraordinary power. It’s not good for us to establish a foothold in the Silver City!”

“Of course, I’ll listen to you, boss,” he added.”If you think it’s better to kill our way through, I’ll follow your orders!”

Liu Long fell into deep thought.

Liu Yan smiled and said,”boss, it’s time to change our way of thinking. We’ve always done this kind of thing in secret ... I’m not used to changing to the front all of a sudden!” But Li Hao is right, we are the government, we are justice, we can’t act like bandits!”

“Boss, maybe ... It’s better to enforce the law directly!” Chen Jian also laughed. When we were in the law enforcement team, we were all open and aboveboard. Later, when the demon hunting squad was established, our place became a basement. Actually, there was a time when I always felt that we were the sinful ones!”

Using the basement as a base and living in the dark every day, that feeling ... Was indeed a little sinful.

He shouted that justice would last forever, but in fact, he was only comforting himself sometimes.

Now that Li Hao said this, Liu Long and the others didn’t understand for a while. After all, they were used to it. They had been like this for several years.

However, after thinking about it carefully ... And thinking about how he had been so open and honest when he was in the law-enforcement team, Liu Long also became slightly distracted.

It wasn’t that he hadn’t thought about it, but that he was really used to doing things in the dark.

And this was actually the style of the night patrolmen.

Night patrolman!

As the name suggested, they appeared at night and patrolled the area. This was what a night Watcher was, so everyone was used to being sneaky. One day, Li Hao suddenly said,”let’s do things openly.” Not only Liu Long, but Wang Ming and the others were actually a little unaccustomed to it.

Seeing that Liu Long was silent, Li Hao carefully said,””There’s one more thing, boss. I suggest that we can’t push all the forces of the Silver City to the opposite side. If we fight one on one, it’ll be more beneficial for us to establish ourselves in the Silver City!”

“We are the nemesis of evil. However, if some people only make small mistakes ... Like pilfering, some supers might have done it before. We can be more lenient.”

Liu Long didn’t say anything, he was thinking.

“Minister Wang, what do you think?”

Wang Ming was speechless. What do I think?

I don’t know anything, I’m not looking!

“I don’t have any objections!”

“Also, I have a small suggestion,” Li Hao continued.

“Speak,” he said.

“Boss, you know we’re short of mysterious energy. How much can we get by killing people?”

Li Hao suggested,”currently, some organizations and some powerful big shots have secretly exchanged material things with some mysterious powers from the black market, the night patrollers, or other supernatural organizations. This is the reason why Silver City can produce a portion of supers.”

“I’m thinking, can we ...”

Before he could finish, Liu Long interrupted,”You can ‘t!”

On the side, Wang Ming also frowned.”We can’t encourage this trend. It’s understandable that you want to get the mystery, but we can’t encourage them to secretly trade and even have the night patrollers endorse them! In this way, it’s easy to lose control of superpowers. Everyone is doing it in secret, but once you openly support it, it’s easy to cause a greater disaster. Li Hao, you have to know that some people are willing to do anything for their own benefits! Darkness is darkness. Once darkness becomes light, it will be difficult to maintain order!”

Chapter 222: Blizzard Silver city’s dark wave (4)
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao nodded thoughtfully and didn’t say anything.

He did have such thoughts and wanted to obtain more mysterious energy through these channels.

However, what these two said made sense, so he didn’t insist. Otherwise, if things went out of control, the Silver City would be in trouble.

Liu Long didn’t say anything else,”then I’ll send official letters to all the families!” It would be best if he could come and register. If he couldn’t ... He had to establish his might! In the past few years, there are still some problems in Silver City. Li Hao, you know the most about some unsolved cases. Even the murderer can’t be found. There’s a high probability that it was done by these people, but it’s a pity that they’ve done it cleanly, and we can’t find any evidence. ”

“Let’s sort out the entire Silver City first. It’ll be easier to find people if there are any more problems.”

“Boss, I’ll deliver the official letter to show my sincerity!” Li Hao took the initiative to ask.

“You’ll go?”

Li Hao nodded.

This was an opportunity for him to find out how many supers there were in the Silver City.

Yes, a ball of light!

As long as it was a super, he could see the light balls. Whether it was Starlight or Dark Moon, the stronger they were, the easier it was to see them. This was much more reliable than the Super detector.

The range of observation of the Super detector was too small, and it could suppress the mysterious energy fluctuations, so it could not detect anything. Although it was difficult for the weak to suppress it, it did not mean that it was impossible.

Since he had decided to stay in the Silver City for the time being, Li Hao also wanted to understand the situation in the Silver City.

At the same time, he wanted to see how many experts were hidden in the Silver City.

Yes, he was sure that there was.

Especially after the matter of the red moon and the eight great families had been exposed, who knew how many supers had poured into the Silver City.

In addition, he might be able to take the opportunity to explore the Qiao’s mining industry.

This was one of the six major corporations in Blizzard Silver City. Under normal circumstances, Li Hao would have no reason or excuse to go there, but now was the perfect time.

Liu Long considered for a moment and nodded,””Good! Do you need our help?”

“Yes, I do. Minister Wang, come with me!”

Li Hao smiled.”He’s a superhuman from white moon City. He’s a Big Shot. Ordinary people don’t dare to reject him!” His appearance also represents our sincerity and determination. Unless you want to completely shed all pretenses of cordiality with the night patrollers, you should listen to him!”

“Alright!”

Wang Ming wanted to say something, but he didn’t want to go.

Damn it!

Li Hao, why do you have to drag me into this?

Weren’t hu Hao and Li Meng here as well?

The two of them were also from the White moon City.

Wang Ming was mentally exhausted. He really didn’t want to do any work when he came here and let Liu Long and the others do whatever they wanted, but now they had to drag him down with them.

……

After the meeting.

Li Hao pulled Wang Ming and walked out together.

Wang Ming was a little reluctant, and couldn’t help but say,”Li Hao, for such a small matter, you can just find someone. Why did you come to me?”

“An able man does more work!”

Li Hao laughed and said in a low voice,””Old Wang, do you want to make a contribution and return to white moon City earlier?”

Wang Ming’s eyes flickered.”How?”

“For example, finding the secret of the eight great families of Silver City, or finding the stronghold of the three major organizations here, or killing some fugitives, or directly advancing to sunlight ... There are too many ways to do so.”

“Does this have anything to do with you pulling me to deliver the official letter?”

“Of course!”

Li Hao nodded with a smile,”this way, we can better understand the silver Blizzard city’s secrets!” Staying in the office all day, was he supposed to wait for clues to appear? Old Wang, we’re both still young, and I want to be promoted as well. So, let’s do it together. ”

Wang Ming was a little moved, and after a long while, he reluctantly nodded.”Alright!”

Li Hao smiled. He knew that this guy was easy to ... Persuade.

If the situation allowed, he actually wanted to go to the Qiao’s mining area to take a look.

It was because Liu Yan had said that something seemed to have been discovered at the mine. The Qiao’s mine was in the suburbs and not too far from the city. They had been mining for many years and seemed to have some mineral resources.

However, for a big enterprise like the Qiao ‘s, it was not that they did not make money from mining such a small mine, but the money they made was not in line with expectations.

Some people said that the Qiao’s liked to give back to their hometown. They mined in the Silver City, providing more employment opportunities for the Silver City, and also providing more taxes for the Silver City. Li Hao didn’t take it seriously. Businessmen pursued profit, and the Qiao’s didn’t have such good intentions.

However, he couldn’t go to the Qiao’s for the first stop.

……

In the afternoon.

Li Hao and Wang Ming were going together. This time, Wang Ming was the one driving, and he would rather die than let Li Hao drive.

This guy’s driving was too much for him, a superhuman.

“Where should we go first?”

“The Silver City’s ancient Academy!”

Li Hao chuckled.”That’s my alma mater. Although I dropped out, I still want to see how strong the ancient academy is. I remember that when some professors go out, the ancient academy’s security team will be in charge of their own security.”

The ancient academy should have some strength.

Not counting the teachers, Li Hao felt that there might also be some powerhouses.

The ancient academy mainly focused on the exploration of ancient civilizations, but there were many other important specializations. When Li Hao was in the ancient academy, he vaguely heard that the ancient academy also explored other areas of ancient civilizations.

……

Silver City ancient Academy.

Li Hao was too familiar with this place.

This time, he was here for work.

Vice director’s office.

Hearing Li Hao’s purpose for coming, the gray-haired Vice President sighed with emotion.””When you were studying at the ancient academy, I felt a little regretful that you dropped out halfway. I didn’t expect that you’d be able to forge your own path after entering the inspector Bureau. It’s not a loss.”

“The ancient academy does indeed have a team of guards. Your teacher is well aware of this. Some of them even received guidance from your teacher.”

Chapter 223: Blizzard Silver city’s dark wave (5)
Translator: 549690339
The gray-haired Vice Director quickly added,””There’s nothing to hide. Silver City didn’t need to register in the past, so we didn’t report it. Since you need to report this time, I’ll ask Captain Chen from the guard team to come over. You can communicate directly. ”

Li Hao nodded. He actually knew Captain Chen.

However, since he was here on official business, he had to first inform the ancient academy.

The vice principal made a call, and not long after, a ... A man as strong as a bear strode in.

When he saw Li Hao, he smiled, and when he saw Wang Ming, he frowned slightly.

“Captain Chen!”

Li Hao laughed.”Sorry to disturb you. We’re here because the Silver City’s night patrollers are establishing a branch. We need to register some of the extraordinary powers in the city. At the same time, we’d like to invite all the members of the extraordinary system to participate in the opening ceremony of the night patrollers in three days!”

He directly explained everything and laughed,””The ancient academy is the place I’m most familiar with, so our first stop will be the ancient academy. I believe that with Captain Chen here, he will be able to cooperate with us.”

“Of course!” Captain Chen nodded.

“And this is?” he looked at Wang Ming after saying that.

“He’s from white moon City. He’s an important figure, Minister Wang Ming!”

Wang Ming was speechless. Li Hao, this guy, introduced everyone he met like this. A Big Shot of white moon City ... Was he afraid that others wouldn’t know he was a big Shot?

“Nice to meet you!”

Captain Chen nodded but did not shake hands. Between the strong, it was better to stay away from each other.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, the other party did not hide anything.”The ancient academy’s guard team isn’t big, with a total of 40 people. However, there aren’t many who have truly stepped into the ten decapitation realm, only seven of them. Including me, it’s 8 people ...”

While registering, Li Hao asked,””Captain Chen, you didn’t hit 100?”

“No, just a little bit more.”

“She’s about the same as the former captain Liu of your law enforcement team,”Captain Chen said with some regret,” but I heard that she’s broken through a hundred?” Is it true?”

“Yes.”

“I’m envious!”

Captain Chen was a little emotional and envious. He did not expect to become a super, but he did have the idea of breaking through 100. Unfortunately, he had not been able to do so.

Being able to slay a peak tenth realm cultivator was not considered weak.

However, Li Hao still asked,””We don’t even have a single superhuman in the ancient academy?”

“How should I put this ...”

He thought for a moment and said,”actually, there’s also one, and he’s not an ordinary Starlight master, but a moon underworld master!” This is also one of the reasons why the ancient academy is relatively stable. However, that person hasn’t been in the ancient academy recently and has gone to another city. ”

Li Hao nodded and didn’t ask further.

He then followed Captain Chen to the guard station to take a look. After a simple inspection, he quickly left the ancient academy.

……

On the road.

Wang Ming frowned.”Li Hao, just a simple check?”

He felt that Li Hao was being perfunctory!

He just looked around and registered. There were no other measures.

Just this?

More secrets could be discovered?

They could discover supers?

You must be joking!

Li Hao smiled and said casually,””They’re all martial masters. It’s not easy to investigate. Could it be that they’re really fighting?”

“Then they should at least bring a super detector. If they don’t bring this, who knows if they’re hiding something?”

“My teacher is here!”

Li Hao was speechless.”Teacher’s senses are very strong after entering the thousand warrior dimension. If there’s really something wrong with the ancient academy, he’ll notice it at once.”

It was only then that Wang Ming remembered this, and he was instantly speechless.

Li Hao didn’t say anything more. In fact, he just hoped that the other forces in the city would soon learn of this inspection method and feel that he was just being perfunctory and wouldn’t take it too seriously.

This way, even if there were supers, they would not leave immediately.

As long as they didn’t hide and stayed in the major forces, they wouldn’t be able to hide from him!

……

Sure enough.

When Li Hao and Wang Ming left the ancient academy, some forces received the news.

Li Hao and Wang Ming went to the ancient academy for an inspection perfunctorily.

He didn’t check at all, just to show his face. He just registered a little and it was done.

……

Qiao’s mining industry.

In the huge office.

The white-haired President of Mrs. Qiao smiled slightly and glanced at his son in front of him.””It’s just a formality, later if someone comes, you go receive them and register, don’t be completely perfunctory ... On Mrs. Qiao’s side, register everything that needs to be registered! The few ten decapitation realm cultivators and the two Starlight Masters ... Have all been registered!”

Qiao Peng smiled and nodded,”father, I know what to do.” Then this Li Hao...Do we need to get in touch with him more?”

“You can make contact with him appropriately ... But don’t get too close to him. There are many people watching him now.”

“Understood!”

“Are you sure ... There’s no problem with Liu Yan?” Mr. Qiao asked after some thought.

“I don’t think so!”

Qiao Peng said in a low voice,”it was handled very quickly!” I believe that guy didn’t have the chance or the time to say anything to Liu Yan. I’ve been testing her for the past few years, and although Liu Yan is very impatient with me, she doesn’t have that kind of bone-deep hatred towards me ... She’s been keeping an eye on the Yama. ”

“That’s good!”

The president of Mrs. Qiao nodded. He didn’t want to deal with Liu Yan unless he had to.

He was the vice-captain of the law enforcement team of the inspection Division, and his relationship with Liu Long was still unclear.

If things got out of hand, it would not be a good thing.

If something really happened to an ordinary patrol, it would be fine. However, Liu Yan was no ordinary person. The other party was a patrol. If a patrol died, even if the night patrolmen were not strong enough, they would still get involved.

Chapter 224: Blizzard Silver city’s dark wave (6)
Translator: 549690339
Her husband was dead, but it wasn’t like the patrol envoy of the inspection Bureau had died. The night patrolmen naturally couldn’t be bothered to get involved in the feud between her and the Yama. They had done their best by issuing a wanted order.

Qiao Peng saw that his father had stopped talking, so he whispered,””Father, there are more and more people paying attention to the Silver City. “Also, our progress is very slow. If this continues, I’m worried that we’ll be exposed.”

“No rush!”

President Qiao smiled.”You can’t eat hot tofu in haste. We have been rooted here for many years. Others can’t compare to us.” In addition, don’t make any more moves there in order to avoid attracting attention. We’ll talk about it later. ”

“Alright!”

Qiao Peng nodded.

Old master Qiao looked at him for a while and suddenly said,””It doesn’t matter if you act a little silly and stupid in front of others. But don’t be stupid at the critical moment! On the Yama’s side, the Yama’s grandson was really dumbfounded! He had been flattered to the point of forgetting himself and was actually bold enough to steal such a precious treasure to show off ... His mind was not clear! It’s fine if he’s dead, but he even dragged the entire Yama into the mud. Don’t learn from him!”

“Don’t worry, father!”Qiao Peng’s face turned serious.

“En!”

“That’s good.” Old master Qiao nodded.”Also, don’t complain about being suppressed all these years and not allowing you to become a superpower.” You’ve only developed your superpower for 20 years. It was unstable before, but now ... It might be stable. When this is over, you can advance again. By then, it won’t be over with just a month. ”

Qiao Peng was overjoyed and quickly nodded.

This was what he had been looking forward to!

All these years, he had not been able to become a super. On one hand, he did not dare to be too flamboyant, and on the other hand, his father had been suppressing him, not allowing him to become a super.

“Father, then ... Then after I advance, I can take some things from there ...” He could not help but ask.

“Shut up!”

Old master Qiao’s face turned cold,”I just reminded you and you forgot?” Stupid! Forget about this, forget about everything else. Remember, we’re just a company, a legitimate company, and we’re only mining. Forget about everything else!”

“Understood!”

Qiao Peng’s face was solemn, and he didn’t dare to say another word.

In his heart, he was a little expectant, a little excited, and a little unwilling ... After working hard for so many years, was his father really going to hand over all those things to someone else?

Of course, they could not afford to offend the Yama.

However, they might not know what they had discovered.

The central region had restricted too much of their power.

If not for that, be it the red moon or the Yama, there would have been experts coming over long ago.

The secrets of the eight great families were more mysterious than he had imagined.

As a local snake that had taken root in Silver City for many years, Mrs. Qiao’s information might not be less than Red Moon ‘s, but she also hid many things.

Qiao Peng slowly backed out of the office as he thought about this.

In the office, old master Qiao looked out the window and was silent for a while. Suddenly, he said,””Be careful. Get close to Li Hao and see if there’s anything special ... Don’t let him discover you. Maybe ... We need his blood to open that place.”

“Too many people are watching him!”

In the dark, someone replied softly.

“I know. That’s why I’m just taking the chance to observe him when he comes. I’m not going to do anything now.”

Old master Qiao said tiredly,”it’s been a few decades. I’m not willing to give up just like that ... Although I know that if I really do it, I’ll be pulling chestnuts out of the fire ... Don’t forget that the development of superpowers has only been 20 years. It’s not like there’s no chance of catching up! If it had developed for a few hundred years, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have had any thoughts about it. ”

In the past 20 years, the superpower organizations had been constantly changing. Some organizations were established today and destroyed the next.

Everything had not stabilized yet!

Even the three major organizations did not mean that they were impregnable.

At this moment, everything was possible.

Old master Qiao did not have such great ambitions to be able to go against the three major organizations. He only hoped that his side would be able to make up for the efforts they had made over the past decades.

“Understood!”

The voice in the dark disappeared.

Old master Qiao lay on the chair alone and continued to look out the window.

The eight great families ...

Silver City!

He was afraid that everyone had underestimated the Silver City and the eight great families. From the information he had obtained, he could tell that the eight great families during the ancient civilization were beyond imagination!

At that time, the Silver City might have been the absolute core of the entire earth!

Whether or not the Qiao family could rise up would depend on all of this.

Chapter 225: Mrs. Qiao (1)
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao visited several shops in the afternoon.

It was almost all perfunctory.

They would meet face to face, notify each other, and make a simple registration. When they felt that they needed to be checked strictly, they would just go through the motions and take a look.

Wang Ming was about to die of anger!

Just this?

And you said you’d make a contribution to your father!

To investigate the strongholds of the three major organizations?

He was now seriously suspecting that Li Hao’s purpose was just to eat and take.

That’s right, this guy didn’t do much. He did receive some things, but they weren’t anything good. They were just some specialties from some companies and Martial Arts Centers. This guy didn’t reject anything!

All of them!

In the car.

The next stop would be the last stop of the day, the Qiao’s mining.

Wang Ming’s face was cold.

He didn’t like Li Hao’s style, so he didn’t want to talk to Li Hao on the way.

Li Hao, on the other hand, took the initiative to start a conversation.”Old Wang, don’t be angry. The tea leaves from that shop just now are pretty good. You can get half of them later.”

“Don ‘t!”

Wang Ming replied coldly.

He was an expert of the full moon Dark Moon, and he didn’t come with Li Hao for some tea leaves. He wanted to make a contribution, not use the name of a Night Watcher to do something like that, like Li Hao did!

If you’re really greedy for a few dozen or a hundred cubic meters of mysterious energy, I’ll still think highly of you.

Good fellow, you’re greedy for so little tea leaves, fruits, and so on. Isn’t it embarrassing?

Li Hao laughed.”You don’t understand. If you accept it, everyone will feel fine. If you don ‘t, they’ll feel bad.” Silver City is just a small place, and we’ll see each other all the time. It’s not a big deal, so there’s no need to make things unpleasant. This is how the grassroots work. ”

“Bullshit!”

“You have to remember that you’re not a third-level patrol inspector now, you’re a patrol envoy!” Wang Ming was a little annoyed. You’re the deputy head of the night patrol’s branch in Silver City. You’re a high-ranking member of the Silver City. There are no more than five people in the entire Silver City who have a higher status than you! You’re like a little wimp, even if you don’t find it embarrassing, I do!”

“Forget about the ancient academy,” Wang Ming angrily rebuked,”that’s where your teacher teaches. It’s an Academy, a Palace of knowledge! It’s fine if you’re polite. As for those small dojos and companies, they were nothing. In the eyes of the night patrolmen, they are nothing!”

Li Hao laughed.”You can’t say that. Even if you become a super, you can’t look down on ordinary people.”

“Get lost, I don’t want to talk to you!”

Wang Ming drove gloomily in a bad mood.

Li Hao laughed again.”Don’t misunderstand,” he said in a low voice.”I’m just trying to lower their guard and get more clues.”

“Hehe!”

Wang Ming sneered,”what did you find?” Tell me about it!”

Li Hao sighed and took out his notebook.””In the afternoon, we went to the ancient academy. There were six dojos and a big company, the Milky Way group, making a total of eight. One martial artist with a record of over 100,24 people who have cut Ten Realms, and two star light Masters, right?”

In the afternoon, 27 transcendents were registered.

The ancient academy had eight tenth severing cultivators.

The remaining companies had 19 transcendents. The 100-plus martial masters and two Starlight Masters were all from the same company, the Galaxy group.

The Galaxy group was also a big group, no worse than the Qiao mining company.

The other party’s main business wasn’t mining, but car manufacturing. Silver City wasn’t the headquarters, but a branch. Even so, the other party had registered more than 100 martial masters, which showed how strong these big companies were.

With over 100 martial masters, he was still very powerful.

Wang Ming nodded slightly, but he was still very dissatisfied.”This is only for registration. Are you sure they’re all registered? Let’s just talk about the Galaxy group. They’re one of the top companies in the Silver Moon province. Even if it’s just a branch, I don’t believe they don’t have a single Dark Moon super. Do you believe that they only have two Starlight Masters?”

He didn’t believe it!

Yue Ming wasn’t weak, but that was only in comparison. This time, three Yue Ming-ranked night patrollers had come from the Silver City.

A big company like the Galaxy group did not lack money or connections. In this day and age, money was useless, but with enough money, one could become a God.

The Galaxy Corporation even had a partnership with the night patrolman headquarters. However, the other party only had two star light Masters in the Silver City branch!

He would never believe it!

However, Li Hao didn’t do a detailed investigation at all. Wang Ming, on the other hand, suggested taking a look around and even suggested using super detectors, but Li Hao didn’t agree, which made Wang Ming so angry that he was about to explode.

Wasn’t this a scam?

Even though he didn’t approve of Liu Long’s arrangements and felt that it wasn’t necessarily a good thing to thoroughly investigate the strength of the various clans, since he had already done so ... He couldn’t afford to be fooled.

“What a righteous guy!”

Li Hao smiled in his heart, but he didn’t show it on his face. He said softly,””Don’t worry, you don’t understand. We’re just the sentries to attract attention! In fact, we have other arrangements. We’ll be responsible for attracting their attention, and someone else will investigate. ”

“Really?”

“Are you lying to me?” Wang Ming was suspicious.

Who are you trying to fool?

I didn’t feel anything strange about this guy. Don’t try to lie to me.

Moreover, the entire team, even Liu Long, would not be able to silently investigate these large companies. It was impossible. Many of these companies had actually installed super detectors.

Although martial masters were difficult to detect, their abilities were limited. They were not like superpowers that could fly in the sky and burrow underground. As long as the security was slightly improved, martial masters often had no way of detecting them.
