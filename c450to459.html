ought for a moment and said,"not only that, I also sensed a special power from the token ... Very special!" I can't describe it in detail, but it feels very vast. It contains the starry sky, has an invincible defense, and a sense of destruction that can destroy everything!"
 As soon as he said that, Zi Yue's expression changed slightly in the distance.
 Special power!
 She seemed to know what it was.
 This place ... Was actually really related to the eight great families.
 The encompassing starry sky, the invincible defense, the destructive energy that could destroy everything ...
 At this moment, her heart trembled.
 This ... Might really be the ruins of the eight great families!
 Li Hao, on the other hand, spoke as if he had seen it with his own eyes. At this moment, even Hao lianchuan was a little dumbfounded. I told you to lie, but I didn't tell you to lie to yourself. Did you lie to yourself?
 Oh my God, I feel like it's true!
  The details were so detailed!
 What tortoise, what King, what special energy ... I didn't teach you these!
 It's really good!
 Li Hao's story was too real. No one could describe the feeling of that power without seeing it.
 However, both the Samsara King and Zi Yue's expressions changed slightly.
 ? Even the flying expert under the cloak held his breath and listened carefully.
 The three major organizations knew more than the night patrollers.
 When Li Hao said this, they all seemed to have thought of something.
 At this moment, Ziyue was a little anxious, but she suppressed this sense of urgency and pretended to be calm.""You didn't manage to get that token?"
 Li Hao frowned."No, but I have a feeling. If I can enter the Qian combat level ... I can use force to capture it. Maybe I can do it!"
 After saying that, he hesitated again.
 "What else is there?" Ziyue caught it and asked hurriedly.
 Li Hao was silent for a moment. Feeling a little irritated, he said,""It's nothing,"
 He must be hiding something!
 Seeing that Zi Yue was impatient, Li Hao said impatiently,""Don't you Red Moon know better than me? What was there to ask? I don't think there's just one token, but eight! Although I didn't see the specific ones, I took a closer look and there might be more in the dark. There should be a total of eight tokens. If I get them, they might have special effects. I don't know the specific details, but your Red Moon might know better than me!"
 Eight!
 Ziyue immediately shut up and stopped asking.
 The eight great families!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This city was definitely related to the eight great families.
 It wasn't just her. At this moment, the others also understood.
 No wonder Li Hao didn't say anything.
 With this, his identity as the successor of the eight great families became even more important. This was a very dangerous matter. Hong Yitang seemed to have realized this. He looked at Li Hao apologetically and said in a low voice,""Li Hao, I didn't know about this before ... If I had known, I wouldn't have asked you."  Li Hao said gloomily,"I'm fine!" It's not the first time they've been watching me anyway. I just feel that This Old House is not simple ... Forget it, you're the ones who will go in, not me!"
 Beside them, Hao lianchuan also frowned and looked at the others. After a while, he said,""We ... Didn't find these tokens before."
 Does everyone believe it?
 Maybe he believed it!
 If he didn't find anything, it might be related to Li Hao's bloodline.
 Of course, no one asked anything at this moment.
 He had understood what he needed to understand.
 As for the danger ... He would only know after trying.
 Li Hao unhappily retreated behind Hao lianchuan. Hao lianchuan also touched the sword a few times before giving it to Li Hao.
 Li Hao was still unhappy.
 150 cubic meters of water energy and an Earthcover sword. He had exposed his secret. At this moment, he was still a little regretful!
 Alright ... I don't regret asking for more.
 If he asked for more, these guys might give him more.
 To people like them, this was nothing.
 150 cubic meters of mysterious energy was nothing!
 Li Hao secretly regretted asking for too little. The Earthfall sword had come by accident, and he should have asked for the clones of Blood God made by the blood shadow from Ziyue ... Perhaps he could have gotten it!
 He really regretted it!
 Beside him, Liu Long scolded in a low voice,"Idiot! Hong Yitang might not be a good person. You ... How could you tell him these things? you idiot, you're in danger. Everyone is watching you now!"
 The voice was very soft, but it could be clearly felt. The three suns seemed to have heard it.
 Hong Yitang's expression didn't change, as if he didn't hear anything.
 Li Hao lowered his head, feeling a little dejected.
  "They forced me to swear on my teacher's name that the members of the five birds sect can die in battle, but I can't let my teacher be humiliated ... I can't swear on my teacher's name, can I?" My teacher saved me many times and fought for me with his life. I ... I can't bear to curse my teacher ... Besides, there are gods in this world, and there are even God-tier Masters. If it really comes true, how can I face my teacher?"
 Liu Long sighed and didn't say anything else.
 The scene also became quiet.
 At this moment, the Samsara King spoke,"you are Liu Long, right?" Since you've been there before, how about the night patrolman send Liu Long to go in with us?"
 "Of course," the king of Samsara continued,"we won't let everyone run for nothing. Whether it's Liu Long or anyone else, whoever is willing to go in ... As long as they come out alive, one person will get 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy!"
 As soon as these words came out, everyone was somewhat moved.
 100 cubic meters?
 What a big move!
 Of course, to the leaders of the big forces, it was best to let people go in willingly. They were not afraid of spending money, and even if they did, it would depend on whether these people could survive.
 If he survived, then he would think about it again.

 This was much better than forcing them in. Forcing them in might hide some important information.
 Of course, the reincarnation King added,'in addition, whoever gets that token ... Will be heavily rewarded! Give it to the Yama, and the Yama is willing to pay a high price to acquire it ... Everyone should understand that there are some things that you can't take away. "
 Everyone understood this.
 Moreover, he might not be able to get it.
 At this time, a member of a small group who had survived the previous attack, sunlight, said,""Lord Samsara King, is everyone's entry fee 100 cubic meters? If Yue Ming is like this, then the sun ..."
 The king of Samsara laughed." 200 cubic meters. It's the same for even sunlight. How about it?"
 "Your Excellency is wise!"
 The sunlit expert smiled.
 For a small organization, 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy was not a small amount. He had only been saying it for fun, but he had not expected the other party to really double it.
 Magnanimous!
  Big organizations were indeed strong.
 The reincarnation King laughed again,"if you come out alive ... It's not impossible for you to join the Yama!" Yama, welcome all non-organization members!"
 As soon as he said this, some of the wandering cultivators were tempted.
 Yama was one of the three great organizations.
 In the beginning, the three major organizations recruited people casually. However, with the rise of superpowers, they gradually stabilized and their numbers increased. Now, organizations like Yama had their own rules and conditions when they chose to add people.
 It wasn't easy for small organizations like them to join the three major organizations.
 Fei Tian did not say anything, and Zi Yue was too lazy to say anything.
 We'll talk when we're out!
 Moreover, even if they joined Yama here ... There was a high chance that they would be cannon fodder. Only if they made it out alive would they have a chance of becoming official members. They couldn't be bothered to say anything.
 "Now, is there anyone willing to try entering the house?" the king of Samsara asked again.
 After hesitating for a moment, three or four wandering cultivators walked out.
 "Yama, Fei Tian, Hong Yue, is no one willing to go?" the reincarnation King asked.
 "If the members of the three major organizations enter, the rewards will be doubled!"
 As soon as these words were spoken, some people from the three large organizations still stepped forward. Obviously, the Samsara King hoped that his own people from Yama could come out alive and give them more information.
 However, he didn't force her this time.
 "I've entered it once, and I don't want to go in again ... But it didn't work!"Liu Long said in a deep voice.
 "Then ... What if I insist on you entering?" the reincarnation King asked.
 If the soft approach didn't work, then the hard approach would!
 He looked at Hao lianchuan."Nightwalker, if Liu Long is not willing to go in, then send a few supers in. We'll go in together!"
 "Why should I?" Hao lianchuan frowned.
  "Because you didn't mention that there was a passage here!"  "You, Hao lianchuan, need our cooperation to attack the inner city together!" The Rotary King said coldly.
 Hao lianchuan cursed under his breath. He looked at Liu Long and said,""Liu Long ... You ... You go in again! Since you're back, I'll reward you with 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy on behalf of the night patrolman!"
 Liu Long frowned, but he still nodded,""Alright, as you command!"
 Since department head Hao was his superior, Liu Long didn't refute him.
 However, he looked at the cycle King and said,"I need 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy. Give it to me now!" I'm worried about you, and ... I want water energy!"
 He looked at the reincarnation King."I want water energy!"
 Are you going to give it to me or not?
 As for whether I need water energy or not, Li Hao asked for fire energy just now, but you didn't give it to me. Will you Give Me Fire energy instead?
 The reincarnation King laughed,"you want water energy?" I've given the rest to Li Hao. You can exchange it with him ... I only have some earth, wind, and metal energy left. They're all the same, there's no difference!"
 I won't give you anything you want!
 After saying that, he threw out some more items, all of which contained a large amount of mysterious energy. Some of them even had some blood on them. Clearly, some people had died in the battle in the square. This guy was the strongest at that time, so he directly collected a part of the human bones.
 Recycling. He didn't need this anyway, and it was a waste.
 Liu Long frowned and didn't say anything.
 He simply handed the items to Li Hao and said in a low voice,""If I can't come out, help me take care of the other brothers in the silver Blizzard city!"
 Li Hao nodded heavily.
 Soon, with the addition of Liu Long, a team of 10 was formed.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The four rogue cultivators, including Liu Long, one from the three major organizations and one from the swords gate. The other one was also from the swords gate ... He was a Martial Master with a cultivation base of over 100. Other than Liu Long, the others were all supers.
 Obviously, these people also wanted to test the difference between superpowers and martial masters.
 Swords gate had sent two people this time, but they were not very strong.
  There weren't many martial masters to begin with.
 He didn't choose to enter one by one. It might be safer to enter one by one, but it was too slow. It was also difficult to distinguish the differences. Was it the influence of superpowers, or was it due to luck, or was it different from martial masters, or was it simply a difference in ability systems?
 The 10 people they had chosen were very unique.
 There were metal, earth, wood, lightning, water ...
 In short, they were not repeated.
 The leaders of the large organizations hoped to test the difference in one go.
 ……
 Li Hao's eyes were filled with worry. He was worried that something might happen to Liu Long.
 This place might be a trap!
 However, she heard Hao lianchuan's voice,""It's not a big problem. We've tested it before. This place is a little special. The survival rate of martial masters is very high, and the superpowers are not low either ... Let's put it this way. The stronger it was, the lower the survival rate! If these guys were really tempted and thought that the low-level supers came out alive, they would be fine. If they were even tempted by the token ... That would be the best! This time, if we can't get the origin god weapon, killing these people will be a good thing. "

 He had already made his preparations.
 If they couldn't enter the inner city ... Then they would weaken the three organizations.
 If Purple Moon and the others dared to enter, their survival rate would be extremely low.
 Li Hao didn't say anything.
 He just looked on silently. In front of him, Liu Long took the lead and entered the ancient house without saying a word. He still had the courage of a Martial Master. Since things had already come to this, he would just go in.
 What was there to worry about?
 He disappeared into the darkness without a sound. The others were a little scared, but when they thought of the benefits ... Very quickly, the other nine also rushed into the ancient house.
 Silence!
 There was no movement at all. The few experts searched but did not find anything.
 No sound came out .... But then, a miserable shriek rang out!
  Everyone frowned!
 In such a strange room, if there was any sound coming from it, it should have been transmitted all the way. Yet, it only transmitted out when there was a scream ... Was it to create a sense of danger?
 It was the voice of a wandering cultivator.
 He might be dead!
 Everyone thought in their hearts, but their expressions did not change. They did not feel any fear because of the dead.
 It was just the death of one wandering cultivator. Even if all of them died, it was still within his expectations.
 After a while, another scream was heard.
 After that, there was no more movement.
 After an unknown period of time, a group of figures appeared on the street behind the ancient house.
 Everyone looked through the faint layer of protective film, and their eyes moved.
 It's out!
 The next moment, those figures quickly ran out towards the square. This was also the previous arrangement. As long as they made it out alive, they would come out immediately!
 A few members of large organizations even had special missions.
 He was going to test hei Teng's reaction!
 The Samsara King didn't say anything and walked directly to the square. The others quickly followed.
 This place wouldn't move, so he didn't have to worry.
 They were more concerned about those who came out alive and whether they had obtained tokens or other treasures.
 Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief. He didn't hear Liu Long's voice, so the captain was probably fine.
 It seemed like only two of them had died ... This death rate was indeed not high.
 It seemed that Hao lianchuan's previous statement of having a 90% chance of survival had been exaggerated!
 This also proved that this guy was deliberately scaring people!
 ……
 A moment later, the crowd arrived at the square.
 Not long after, a figure took the lead and quickly ran towards them. It was Liu Long. He did not dare to stay in the city for too long, so he quickly ran back after coming out.  Not only him, there were also a few figures behind him who were extremely fast.
 All of them ran faster than rabbits.
 Soon, these people appeared in the square. Seeing that they were about to come out, Hao lianchuan quickly said,""Don't come out rashly. Once you come out, the protective layer we just put on you will disappear! If you want to block the power again, you have to walk again. This thing doesn't last forever. It will last in the city and will disappear once you come out!"
 The other supers were a little scared, but Liu Long didn't care and walked out.
 He was a Martial Master, so he didn't feel any protective barrier.
 Just come out and stop it!
 He didn't want to stay inside.
 At this moment, someone ran out of the city. It was a Dark Moon elite from the red moon. He looked very excited.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He ran all the way to the edge of the square. He was panting and a little scared. He whispered,""My Lord!"
 "Alright!" Ziyue nodded slightly and said in a deep voice,"just say it!"
 There was nothing to hide since all the large organizations had people.
 "My Lord ... I ... I was about 10 meters away from one of the black Phoenix and used some of my powers ... But ... But the black Phoenix really didn't react!" The man said excitedly.
 As soon as these words came out, everyone's hearts moved.
 Within a 10-meter radius, he used his superpower, but the other party really didn't react.
 Zi Yue subconsciously wanted to enter the square to check if there was anything different. Hao lianchuan whispered,""If you enter now, that silver will remember your aura and might come for you immediately!"
 Ziyue frowned and didn't say anything.
 That was a possibility!
 She looked at her subordinate and said,""You, come out!"
 The other party obeyed the order and quickly walked out. The moment he walked out, Zi Yue wrapped him with the power of Thunder. In an instant, Zi Yue felt something different. The moment the other party came out, it was like the armor, and he had some connection with the ground. However, when he walked out, the connection was immediately cut off!
 "Underground?"
 She looked at the ground, and Hao lianchuan nodded.
 Everyone instantly understood. It seemed that this protective film came from underground. It might be the same as the black Phoenix. When they walked into that house, they were protected by the earth.
 However, stepping out of it meant that the connection with the earth had been cut off. Thus, the protective film had dissipated, and he had to walk again.
  "How do you feel?"
 "That house ... Was pitch-black, similar to what Li Hao said. But ... I didn't see any token."
 After saying a few words, the man looked at Li Hao with some suspicion.
 The others didn't care. It was normal for Li Hao to see it, and it was also normal for them not to see it.
 Perhaps the bloodline of the eight great families was really special.
 "Are you in danger?"
 "It's a little dangerous ..."
 "In the middle, it felt like someone had put a bag over me ..." The man said with lingering fear."Maybe it was to create a protective film for us ... I felt like I was about to suffocate, but it dissipated very quickly. Then I came out."
 "Any other discoveries?"
 "There's nothing else,"

 Zi Yue frowned slightly and continued to wait.
 A moment later, the others all came out.
 Out of the eight people, two had died.
 One was a rogue cultivator, the other was a member of the Yama ... The Samsara King was so angry that he was about to vomit blood. Another member of the Yama!
 "Two people are dead. One of them is at the full moon tier, the other is at the full moon tier, one is of the fire element, and the other is of the lightning element ..."
 Ziyue said a few words and considered for a moment before saying,""Is it too aggressive? But the metal-type is still alive ..."
 In terms of offensive power, the metal element was slightly stronger than the fire element.
 The one with the gold element is still alive!
 However, it was a fact that more attack-type superpowers died.
 Moreover, none of the eight of them saw the token.
  If someone else had said it, they might have taken it as a lie. However, everyone believed that Li Hao's words might really exist. It was just that these people were not strong enough, not lucky enough, or perhaps had the wrong bloodline.
 "It can indeed block the Super waves!"
 "What do we do now?" the reincarnation King asked. Do you want to go that way?"
 The risk was not small, with a 20% mortality rate.
 Hao lianchuan frowned and said,"I'm not leaving!" This kind of luck deciding life and death, then I might as well rely on strength! Even if I'm killed by these soldiers, I'm willing. If you want to go, you can go by yourself. In any case, if I don't go, the night patrolmen won't be allowed to go either ... If you really can 't, go that way under the sunlight. Even the sunlight has the power to fight!"
 Some of the night patrollers scratched their heads.
 There's no way to block off the fluctuations of superpowers. If everyone else can do it, we, the night patrollers, will be in danger!
 However, since the Minister had said so, no one could refute him.
 At that time, the losses of the night patrolmen might be even greater ... They might even be treated as a protective talisman by the others. In any case, if they were to be discovered, they would find the night patrolmen first.
 However, there were also people who felt that it was better to rely on strength than luck.
 At this moment, the reincarnation King spoke,""I'm willing! However, those who don't use that passage and those with strong superpowers will be assigned to attract Black Phoenix's attention and create opportunities for others ... You Nightwatchers don't have any objections to this, right?"
 Hao lianchuan was about to refuse, but the cycle King said coldly,""There are risks in both! It's dangerous to go through the second passage, but it's also dangerous to be a target bait. If you think it's more dangerous to be a bait, then go through the second passage!"
 He looked at everyone and said,"everyone is no exception. Those who Walk This Way will be the bait to attract hei Teng's attention!" Those who took the second passage would listen to the command and kill hei Teng in secret. They would work together with the bait in front to kill the strong enemy! If we don't get rid of these black flames, this exploration will be a failure!"
 This plan was not bad.
 Each had its own risk.
  Hao lianchuan thought for a while and nodded.""That works too! The night patrollers don't use the second passageway ... If you're not willing, you can come with us!"  The large organizations began to discuss, and after a while, the crowd was divided into two teams.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Now, there were about 150 people left.
 There were about 80 people who chose to go through the second passage, more than half of them. Among them, not all of the three suns were willing to go, only a few were.
 Yama's Yao Cheng, Red moon's Zi Yue, swords gate's Hong Yitang.
 Only the three of them chose the second passage, the two three suns of the fairy realm didn't choose the second passage, neither did the female Third Sun of swords gate and the reincarnation King.
 Li Hao was surprised.
 Weren't they all clamoring to leave earlier?
 The reincarnation King had actually chosen to stay.
 Of course, it might be to keep the night patrollers in check. Who knew?
 Zi Yue chose to take the tunnel. Li Hao guessed that it was probably because she was injured and the silver-armored warrior had been watching her and supporting her for a long time. She was probably worried that her superpower fluctuations would be obvious and she would continue to be targeted by the silver-armored warrior.
 At this moment, Li Hao prayed in his heart ... That he would die!
 These guys wouldn't feel any heartache even if they died there.
 Of course, according to Hao lianchuan, the stronger one was, the higher the death rate. However, it was not impossible to survive. Hao lianchuan might have gone through it too. Li Hao did not ask. If he had gone through it, then he was still alive, which meant that the three suns had a chance of surviving.
 "We'll split into two groups. After you guys enter, quickly hide yourselves and wait for us to enter. Once we attract the black Phoenix's attention ... Ziyue, you guys will secretly lead a group and attack from the front and back. The silver-armored soldier will be the first target. Try your best to push all the black Phoenix out of the city ... This way, even if the silver-armored soldier is fine, he won't be a threat without the cooperation of the Army!"
  After making some arrangements, the reincarnation King said,""Also ... Don't go near the inner city rashly. There might be more benefits ... There might be greater risks! The ruins this time were obviously different from the past. He didn't want to lose his life for a moment of greed! If you don't show up after one minute of fighting ... We will choose to retreat!"
 He couldn't create any opportunities for these people. Although Yaocheng was among them, he had to be careful.
 After a minute, if they didn't see anyone coming, they would retreat. Black Phoenix would return and definitely deal with them.
 "Huanhuan, don't think that everyone is so despicable!" Zi Yue sneered.
 "Just in case!"
 The Samsara King did not say anything else. After confirming the plan, Ziyue led her men over.
 As for them, all they needed to do was wait. When they all entered, someone would come and report. At that time, it would be time to attack.
 ……
 Everyone waited in silence.
 At this time, Hu dingfang also walked to Li Hao's side. He glanced at Li Hao and said expressionlessly,""Later on, get closer to me, but don't get too close ... It's dangerous!"

 Li Hao nodded.
 Hu dingfang glanced at him and didn't say anything."This kid, just don't run around."
 Li Hao and the others all started to wait.
 He was looking forward to the results.
 The others hoped that they would live ... While Li Hao wished that they would all die.
 After about 10 minutes, a black shadow flickered continuously in the city. A cloaked man quickly ran over. It was Fei Tian's men, and Fei Tian had also sent some people in.
 The person's breath was a little unstable and heavy. As he approached the edge of the square, he quickly whispered,""Not good ... Yama's Lord Yao Cheng didn't come out ... Lord Zi Yue's injuries seem to have worsened ... Sword head Hong doesn't seem to have any major problems ..."
 As soon as these words were spoken, the aura of the Samsara King trembled!
 What?
 Yaocheng is dead?
  The Samsara King almost exploded in anger. How could this be?
 Yaocheng was one of the three suns, how could he just disappear without a trace?
 "In addition, other than the few Lords ... The losses are not small. 22 people died, and only 60 people came out alive ..."
 A quarter of their losses!
 Was it worth it?
 It was hard to say whether it was worth it or not. Previously, it was also a free choice, and death was inevitable. However, no one expected that they would lose a three yang.
 The reincarnation King's face turned ashen!
 Yaocheng was dead. As for the others ... He didn't care.
 'Damn it!'
 From the moment they entered until now, the Yama King had suffered too many losses.
 He suppressed the frustration in his heart and said in a deep voice after a while,""Understood!"
 Around him, the Yama experts who followed him also felt heavy.
 This time, apart from Hong Yue, the Yama King had suffered the most losses.
 After taking a deep breath, the Samsara King looked at the others."Hu dingfang...Hao lianchuan ... Are they all ready?"
 "I can do it anytime!"
 "Then ... Let's take action!"
 They had to get rid of the black Phoenix as soon as possible.
 In the next moment, one expert after another stepped into the square. The power on their bodies fluctuated, and their powerful auras swept through the city.
 In the blink of an eye, a silver-armored expert appeared. The black-armored man and the bronze-armored man under his feet also quickly gathered in this direction.
 The battle was about to start again!
 ……
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Within the city.
 In a small alley, Zi Yue's face was pale, and so was Hong Yitang's face. The two three suns were regretting their decision.
 They didn't really know what happened in the house.
 However, not only did he lose Yaocheng, but the two of them were also seriously injured.
 What made Zi Yue's heart ache even more was the fact that her Thunder God's armor had been severely damaged. At this moment, it could no longer be displayed and could only be nurtured in her body. This was the root of her heartache.
 Without the Thunder God's armor, her strength would be greatly damaged. Before, her defense was very strong, but now, it was greatly weakened!
 Although Ziyue felt the pain, she smiled when she saw the silver-tier elite flying away.
 As expected, it really worked.
 Otherwise, the closer he was to the other party, the more likely it would have flown straight towards him. Although he had paid a price now, the trouble that would follow would be the reincarnation King and the others '.
 "Wait for a minute, then we'll set off!"
 Zi Yue transmitted her voice to Hong Yitang,"one minute ... We have to make those guys bear the pressure and kill some of them first."
 "Did you see the token?" he asked.
 Hong Yitang was silent for a while and then said,""I think so ... But I feel like there's a layer between us. Did the purple Moon leader see it too?"
 "I saw a golden light ... I'm not sure if it's a token."
 The two of them stopped talking.
 However, they were sure that there was treasure in the house. Unfortunately, they couldn't get it. Zi Yue was already considering whether she should find an opportunity to capture Li Hao and force him to go in.
 In the distance, a loud boom could be heard.
 A great battle had erupted!
 They waited for the battle to break out for a while before they, led by Ziyue and Hong Yitang, sneakily approached the area.
 The power of breath control gave them the opportunity to launch a sneak attack.
 ……  Li Hao slashed out with the Earthcover sword and sent a Black Phoenix flying a few steps.
 It was a little chaotic at the moment.
 There were battles everywhere!
 There were many black hou, but the three suns experts were not weak. This time, they were very bold and directly charged into the formation!
 Hu dingfang and the Samsara King joined forces to hold back the silver-tier expert. The remaining three suns all rushed into the camp and kept beating hei Teng out!
 However, there were still too many Black Phoenix.
 With the support of the earth, their defense was very strong. Only the three suns had a slight advantage. Even the sunlight couldn't take too much of an advantage. There were also eight copper puppets who caused a lot of trouble for everyone.
 At this moment, if no one came to help, they could only retreat again.
 Li Hao didn't care so much. He just struck again and again, using his sword momentum.
 These black hou were the best targets!
 He didn't care whether the black banner was damaged or not. He slashed again and again. It had to be said that Hong Yitang's Earthcover sword was very powerful. After holding this sword, Li Hao's every slash caused the ground to shake.
 It was also not like before, where the sword would shatter after the sword force was integrated into it.
 What a good person!
 At this moment, Li Hao was accumulating power. These Black Phoenix were all his practice targets.
 Li Hao heard a scream, but he didn't care.
 At this juncture, he just had to take care of himself.
 In the chaos, he held a bone in one hand and activated the five birds breathing technique. That was the bone given to him by the Samsara King. At this moment, water energy was constantly flowing into his body. He was not the only one doing this. During the battle, the others were also replenishing their powers.
 On Li Hao's side, it didn't seem too abrupt.
 He asked the Samsara King for fire energy, but he had to give him water energy ... Li Hao was very dissatisfied and even gave him an extra 50 cubic meters. If he gave so much water energy, his kidney would become stronger. If he were to suddenly become a Qian Dynasty Warrior ... Wouldn't that be troublesome?
 There were so many people here, so he had to cross into the thousand warrior realm quietly.
 Therefore, Li Hao was still relatively restrained.
 Even if the five elements were in balance, they had to be restrained.
 The black Phoenix was very strong, but their ability to distinguish directions was really not good. They could only distinguish directions based on supernatural waves and sounds. Li Hao began to try other methods to deal with them, such as sending them flying with his sword!
 He was trying to see how he could instantly send someone flying into the air. These black puppets were the best targets.
 One by one, the black banners flew into the air!
 Li Hao was having a lot of fun ... When he really encountered danger, he would move closer to Hao lianchuan and Hu dingfang. Hu dingfang was fighting a silver warrior, so Li Hao wouldn't go over and court death.
 After balancing his five internal organs and strengthening his inner strength, Li Hao began to practice the ninth-refinement force ...
 A minute passed in the blink of an eye.
 At this moment, powerful superpowers burst out from behind!
 Without any superpower fluctuations, even the silver-tier powerhouse did not notice the arrival of these people. In the blink of an eye, the black banners were sent flying and landed outside the city.
 "BOOM!"
 The silver-tier expert seemed to have only just felt his anger. He slashed his sword madly, forcing the Samsara King and Hu dingfang to retreat. Behind him, Zi Yue and the others quickly entered the battlefield.
 The black puppets were directly sent flying by them.
 For the first time, the foreign supers gained the upper hand in the battle between the two sides and completely defeated the black armor Army.
 Bang Bang Bang!
 p The black banners landed outside the square. Soon, they lost their momentum and fell to the ground, motionless.  At this moment, the silver-tier powerhouse seemed to be a little angry. He even let out an angry roar. It was extremely horrifying and a little stiff. However, everyone heard it. It seemed to be a roar!
 "Hold him back!"
 Hao lianchuan roared. On the other side, the Samsara King also shouted,""Quick, defeat these black flames and come help us!"
 The silver-tier powerhouse had gone crazy!
 At this moment, he didn't care and slashed down with his sword!
  The number of black-armored warriors below was rapidly decreasing.
 "Retreat!" The silver-tier powerhouse roared again. A few bronze archers in the crowd quickly retreated with some Black Phoenix. However, most of them were stopped, but some managed to escape.
 "They will escape?"
 Some people were shocked. These guys actually knew how to escape?
 It was too unbelievable!
 Rumble! The others ignored this and continued to attack. The remaining black flames continued to lose their momentum, and gradually, the area outside was filled with black-armored soldiers.
 Just these gains alone were enough to make the large organizations laugh!
 The second passage was not wasted.
 Although some people had died, if they hadn't come silently, they wouldn't have been able to easily pincer the black Vatican.
 For a time, everyone's morale was greatly boosted.

 As a portion of the black Phoenix retreated, the battle became easier.
 Even if the silver-tier powerhouse refused to leave and was still erupting, more and more three suns joined the battlefield, and the silver-tier chiliarch could not hold on any longer.
 With a deafening roar, a blinding light burst out from the White armor. The other party rose into the air, instantly breaking free from the suppression.
 After they rose into the air, it would not be easy to fight.
 Because the three suns were now restricted and could not fight in the air.
 The spatial restriction here was too strong!
 Therefore, after a moment, everyone could only watch this silver-tier powerhouse step into the air and disappear in front of everyone.
 However, the battle results were still extremely glorious.
 The battle continued!
 However, it was a one-sided situation.
  Bang Bang Bang!
 The black banners were thrown out of the square. After a few minutes, the battlefield was completely cleared.
 Everyone's face revealed a smile.
 There were more than 800 Black Phoenix, and at least 500 of them had been killed this time.
 He directly killed more than half of them in one go!
 A 1,000-man team was left with only about 300 people in the city. There were even three bronze-armored soldiers who were directly blown up.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The bronze armored soldiers were unable to be captured.
 Once they left the city, they would all explode. So this time, no one wanted to capture the other party and was directly blown up by the other party.
 A thousand-man commander, five hundred-man commanders, and around 300 Black Phoenix soldiers had fled the area.
 The battle results were still extremely brilliant!
 Of course, the black Phoenix's destructive power was also terrifying.
 Out of the 150 apostles, 20 of them had died in the second passage. This time, they had lost another 20 during the one-minute fight.
 At this point, there were only about 100 supers left.
 They had also lost nearly half of their men.
 However, the ones who died were the weak. Yue Ming died the most, sunlight didn't have many, and the three suns only had the unlucky Yao Cheng who died in the second passage.
 Even though their numbers had been greatly reduced, their combat strength, to be honest, did not have much of an impact.
 This time, even the night patrollers had a few dark moons who died in battle.
 Although Hao lianchuan was not weak, he did not expose his fiery phoenix spear at the moment, so he could not take care of his surroundings. Hei Teng was not weak either, so a few unlucky dark moons were killed instantly.
 However, everyone was prepared before they came in.
 It was impossible for no one to die.
 The night patrolman was still alright. At least, riyao was still alive.
 Compared to Yama ... On Yama's side, the Samsara King's face was green at this moment. More than 30 people had entered, and now, including himself ... There were only nine left!
 p Five of them had taken the second passage. Including him, four of them had not passed the second passage.  Nine people!
  The Samsara King wasn't happy at all. He didn't care if the Dark Moon sunlit cultivators died, but the death of the three sun realm cultivators really affected the overall situation!  Yaocheng ... Trash!
 Even Hong Yitang is alive, but you're dead!
 Out of the remaining 100-man team, Fei Tian still had close to 20 people. The other party did not have many people enter, so they did not suffer many losses.
 The remaining night watchers were the most, close to 30.
 Red Moon was ranked around 20, swords gate was also ranked around 20, and with the Yama, there were about a hundred of them.
 As for itinerant cultivators ... There were only five or six of them who had survived until now. Almost all of them under the sun glory realm had died.
 This was the tragedy of small organizations and individual cultivators.
 Without the three suns, even sunlight would not be able to handle a crisis. Not to mention helping others, it was already a good thing that they were not dragged down. On the side of the large organizations, the three suns powerhouses would at least help them clean up the crisis from time to time.
 The battle was over, but the crowd did not go out. Instead, they stood in the square.
 On the ground, some corpses were being devoured.
 Li Hao's group immediately started to clean up the battlefield. No matter whose body it was, they would take it back with them. If it wasn't their own ... They would also secretly take out something, preferably some mysterious energy.
 The three suns experts began to gather.
 Hu dingfang took the initiative to speak this time. He said in a deep voice,""The silver-tier elite has run away, along with more than 300 black armors. Right now, I don't know if they're scattered in the city or back at the city gates ... Other than this 1000-man team, are there any other elites at the city gates?"
 Hao lianchuan said,"I saw that many of the black Phoenix did not escape back. Instead, they have scattered. Why don't we start from the ninth Street and clear them one by one? then, we can gather near the city gate!" It's been almost a day since then!"
 This time, they only had three days to enter the ruins.
 Now, it was probably the first night.
 They would clear the outer city and gather at the gate of the inner and outer city for the final battle!
 This was Hao lianchuan's plan.
 Everyone thought for a moment. Someone nodded, and someone said in a deep voice,""Why don't we act in a group? If we split up, the danger will increase!"
 At this moment, it was a taboo to split up!
 What if a large number of black armors were hidden somewhere?
 They did not understand why Hao lianchuan would make such a suggestion.
 However, the leaders and the three suns did not object. No one said anything wrong.
  Group action?
 At this moment, it was time to share the results of the battle.
 Whoever dealt with the black-armored man would get it.
 This was the first reason. The second reason was that if they were to move together ... How would it be convenient for them to do something private?
 For example, most of the night watchmen survived ... Was it appropriate not to kill some of them?
 Especially the reincarnation King ... He was the most displeased!
 They couldn't wait to split up!
 Now, more than half of hei Teng's forces had been dealt with, and the remaining half could be dealt with by the three suns. It was no big deal for a few more people to die.
 This was human nature!
 They were already enemies, so the so-called cooperation was just a joke.

 As for the inner city ... Even if he didn't go to the inner city, he had actually profited by getting so many black armors this time.
 Therefore, when Hao lianchuan said to split up, the three suns actually had no objections.
 "There are only black armors in the city," the reincarnation King said."They're not much of a threat. Let's go to the city gate and take a look, just in case the silver-tier experts appear again ..."
 We, the three suns, just need to stay away from you and you'll kill them in the city!
 He would kill the black-armored man and the others.
 This was the essence of ruin exploration. It was not just about the wealth of the ruins, but also the wealth of other supers.
 And this was obviously not the first time.
 Be it the supers or martial masters in the crowd, they all seemed to be used to it.
 Hao lianchuan continued,"we have to work together. Only by working together can we achieve a win-win situation!" After clearing the black armors in the city, everyone gather at the city gate. Oh right, the black armors that are cleared in the city belong to whoever solves them ... Even if you contribute, it will be counted as contribution!"
 Everyone was silent.
  This is the true nature of supers and a continuation of the Silver Moon martial forest ... Anyway, you guys do as you see fit. We three suns will go further away. If you guys are afraid of death, quickly gather at the city gate.
 If you're not afraid of death, then do it in the city!
 Yes, they still gave some people a chance. You can go to the city gate and meet up with three suns. That way, everyone would at least have some face and not do anything at the city gate.
 The next moment, Zi Yue left first and said coldly,""Let's go. Hurry up. We have to be careful of other experts in the inner city ... That'll be troublesome!"
 The three suns quickly left.
 Hu dingfang had the intention to bring Li Hao along, so he waved at Li Hao ...
 It's not a big deal to bring someone along. Didn't you see that Hong Yitang left with his daughter?
 However, Li Hao shook his head. With a simple and honest look, he glanced at Liu Long and Liu Yan, as if saying that he wanted to leave with his Captain!
 Hu dingfang frowned slightly.
 "It's okay," Hao lianchuan said telepathically."Let's go. Hongyue probably has an order. She won't dare to kill him!" Besides, he has a good relationship with the swords gate ... There aren't many people who would dare to make a move on him. Liu Long is also a Qian warrior, so he shouldn't be a problem!"
 Hu dingfang was a little hesitant, but he did not say anything more and left.
 As for Li Hao, he actually wanted to say something.
 Flying heavens sect and swords gate still had a three suns hidden, should he take them all?
 He wanted to tell Hao lianchuan ... But after some consideration, he gave up.
 Because it might not be a good thing for the two of them to leave.
 If he didn't leave, he might have an unexpected harvest.
 As three suns left, RI Yao and Yue Ming who were left behind looked at each other and did not say anything.
 On Red moon's side, the group of people didn't say anything and quickly disappeared.  Because at this moment, many people were secretly sizing up the strong men of the Crimson Moon.
 He heard that there was an invisible red shadow on the red moon's side.
 Did these guys have it?
 Some people glanced at Li Hao, wondering if he would extract the red shadow.
 It was said that it required an origin divine weapon ... But that didn't matter. The important thing was, did Li Hao know how to use it to become a profound God?
 On the swords gate's side, the leader was a late-stage solar glory cultivator. The man was younger than the rest. He glanced at Li Hao and said with a smile,""Silver Moon martial arts is one family. Li Hao, if you need anything, you can come to swords gate!"
 Then, he waved his hand and left with the swords gate disciples.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao grinned and sent them off with a smile.
 The other parties left one after another.
 After they had left, the metal element Minister Zhou said in a deep voice,""Everyone be careful. Our night patrolmen's superpowers have not entered the second passageway. We are not as hidden as them!"
 He looked around and said,"we have seven people from sunlit this time ..."
 In fact, there was also Wang Ming and Liu Long.
 However, he didn't take it into account.
 "We'll be too big of a target if we split into two groups. Hao bu's intention was clear when he left. He wanted us to kill as many of the experts from the three major organizations as possible!"
 "I'll lead a team, and uncle he will lead another team!"He said in a deep voice.
 He and Minister he were both deputy ministers.
 They were both at the peak of the sun glory realm.
  He was of the metal element, while Minister he was of the water element.
 The remaining five members of sunlight had also been assigned. He took three of them, and Li Hao knew the remaining two: Huang Yun of the wind element and Zhao Huan of the earth element. He obviously knew Wang Ming and Liu Long's strength, since they were both in the second team. In this case, the strength of the two sides was actually about the same.
 Zhang Ting was also in the water team, following Minister he.
 Li Hao didn't know if this was Minister Zhou's arrangement or Hao lianchuan's order. He didn't care.
 At this moment, his killing intent was not as strong as before.
 He had not even used up the 150 cubic meters of water energy.
 Besides, the black armor is almost gone, how the hell am I supposed to kill this mid three yang?
 Hao lianchuan, don't even think about using someone else's knife to kill me ... Besides, my knife is too weak. Even if you use someone else's knife to kill me, there's no chance. If it was before, there was still hope. But now, it's too difficult. Li Hao is not willing to take the risk.
 Li Hao and the others were in this team, so they took care of him.
 The leader, Minister he, didn't say much and quickly led the few people into the street. As they walked quickly, he said,""This is also a chance for everyone to train themselves. Large organizations often use this method to let the weak see the world and see blood! In short, if we encounter people from the three major organizations, just kill them. There's nothing to say. "

 "What if you meet the swords gate?"
 Someone asked in a whisper.
 "Swords gate ... If they don't mess with us, we won't mess with them either. Swords gate is a local organization, and we have some cooperation with them. The three major organizations are all officially defined as dark energy organizations! If we encounter them, we can only kill them!"
 They had been cooperating well before, but in the blink of an eye, they had started to fall out.
 This was also a daily routine.
 The difference between officials and bandits.
 She called him 'baby' when she needed him, but when she didn't need him, she would be his enemy.
 At this moment, Li Hao did not say anything. He just looked around ... Even though those people had passed through the second passage and concealed their superpowers, superpowers still existed. So, he was very emotional at this moment.
 There were no superpowers, he was well hidden!
 They passed by an old house, and there was actually a superhuman hiding under the roof. Minister he, who was at the peak of the sun glory realm, actually didn't notice.
  It had to be said that the supers who had passed through the second passage had gained a lot.
 At the very least, they had the advantage of time and place in this place.
 Unfortunately ... In Li Hao's eyes, these big light bulbs were particularly eye-catching in the darkness.
 He could see the situation of the supers on the neighboring Street. It would be difficult for Li Hao to see further away, but that was enough. On both sides of the street, including the street he was on, he could see the supers on three streets at the same time.
 What Li Hao needed to guard against were actually only martial masters.
 He looked around curiously and observed the supers. It was probably because they had more people, but these hidden supers did not attack them. They were looking for death.
 There were many sunlit experts on this side, so they were not afraid of ordinary attacks.
 That was why Minister he dared to walk on the streets so boldly.
 Li Hao felt that it was a pity ... If he had acted alone with Liu Long and the others, the guy under the roof would have been killed by now and he could have gotten some mysterious energy. However, there were people here, so he couldn't remind them.
 However, Minister he didn't realize that the existence of the middle stage of the three yang realm might have sensed some movement.
 She also glanced in that direction, but she didn't say anything, nor did she have any intention of reminding him.
 Seeing Li Hao looking around, Zhang Ting, who wasn't far from him, also asked in a low voice,""Li Hao, are you familiar with the layout of the city when you entered it?"
 "It's alright!"
 Li Hao grinned."This is the sixth Street. Each Street isn't too long, about 1500 meters long. There are small alleys on both sides that lead to other streets. There were black armors patrolling before, but that might not be the case now. Those black armors might have hidden away ..."
 As he said that, suddenly, a sharp scream came from the front!
 Li Hao and the others hurriedly looked over, and their expressions changed the next moment.
 At that moment, they saw a different scene.
 The door of an ancient house opened and a bronze armor appeared. With a sword, it killed a hidden superpower outside the house. The next moment, the bronze armor closed the door and disappeared!
 Everyone was shocked!
 How was that possible?  At this moment, Minister he couldn't care less and shouted,""A copper-armored man appeared in the ancient house and suddenly attacked!"
 This was a big deal!
 This had never happened before, so they had to be careful and alert. It didn't matter if the others died, but the other team might not know the situation. Even if they told everyone, they had to be informed!
 As soon as these words were spoken, chaos quickly broke out on the streets.
 There were armored soldiers in the ancient house!
 ……
 The first street, outside the inner city gate.
 At this moment, the huge city gate was tightly shut.
 The three suns were in the middle of a discussion when they suddenly heard Minister he's roar. Everyone's expression changed slightly. Hao lianchuan's face was also solemn. He suddenly turned his head and looked in another direction. He frowned and said,""How can this be? Such a situation had never happened before ... Were only copper armors allowed to enter the ancient house, or were black armors allowed as well? In this case ... It's going to be a little troublesome!"
 The remaining 300 or so black armors were not here. At this moment, the city gate was closed, and only some black armors could be seen on the high walls. However, outside the city gate, there was not a single black armor.
 Was this guerilla warfare?
 The expressions of Zi Yue and the others also changed. They looked at Hao lianchuan and asked,""The ancient house ... Has the three yang entered it?"
 Hao lianchuan shook his head."No. The sun glory went in, but he never appeared again!"
 Everyone frowned.
 This was a little troublesome.
 He was just thinking that it would be easy to deal with these guys who were wandering on the streets.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But now ...
 Just as he was thinking, another loud roar was heard,""Black armors can't enter the ancient room ... Only copper armors can!"
 As soon as these words came out, the few of them heaved a sigh of relief.
  It was still alright!
 It seemed like the bronze-armored soldier's authority was higher than the black-armored soldier 's. It made sense. The bronze-armored soldier was a Centurion and was considered an official, while the black-armored soldier was just an ordinary soldier. Their authority should be different.
 "There are only five copper-armored warriors ... It shouldn't be a big problem if we're careful."
 The crowd felt a little more at ease. At this moment, they all looked at the city gate.
 The huge city gate had an ancient bronze color.
 The city gate was very high, probably close to a hundred meters.
 There was nothing they could do but try to open the city gate.
 The Samsara King didn't say much. He quickly condensed a wind blade and shot it at the city gate. With a bang, the wind blade exploded, but it didn't cause any damage to the city gate. This time, even he, who was at the peak of the three suns, had a headache.
 ,m "Hao lianchuan, you can't fly and you can't open it by force ... Are you sure you can open this city gate?"  Hao lianchuan sighed."There's still hope ... We let Yuan Shuo in so that he could think of a way to open the city gate. You guys are good. You chased him away before he even entered ... Otherwise, with his knowledge, I think there's a good chance."

 Everyone was silent.
 Are we not letting him in?
 He was the one who wanted to fight sun Yifei. He killed sun Yifei and so many people from Red Moon, and he even exposed his spirit accumulation realm. What could we do?
 The group of people started to study the city gate.
 At the same time, they were also on guard against the appearance of the silver-tier expert.
 Or perhaps ... They were trying to lure him out. According to Hao lianchuan's judgment, this chiliarch might be in charge of something important, such as a key. Could the city gates be opened with a key?
 And this key, according to the usual rules, should be in the hands of the chiliarch who guarded the city gate. For example, everyone felt that his big sword, which fit the gap on the city gate, might be the key!
 Unfortunately, that fellow was not appearing anymore.
 He could vaguely see a silver-white flash on the city wall.
 Everyone judged that once all the black armors in the city were taken care of, and Tong Jia was also dead, this guy might not be able to hold back.
  ……
 Bang! Bang!
 Within the city.
 Li Hao and the others worked together to send a Black Phoenix flying. They punched each other, and someone used wind energy ...
 In the blink of an eye, they had thrown a black armor into the air for a minute.
 Gradually, the black Phoenix stopped struggling. This was the third Black Phoenix they had taken down. Up until now, the team had only encountered a few supers. However, they did encounter a few black armors. These black armors were still unconscious and could not hide in the ancient house like the copper armors. At this moment, they could only be taken down by their combined efforts.
 Even further ahead, Minister he and the others had also easily dealt with two black-armored men.
 By now, the small team had almost swept through the entire Street. Other than being a little more careful to guard against the appearance of the copper armors on both sides, dealing with the black armors was a piece of cake.
 The sounds of battle could be heard from other streets as well.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Of course, there were also unlucky ones who were killed by the black-armored man.
 After all, there were still around 300 black armors. There were more in some places, and if one was unlucky, it was normal to be killed.
 After a while, Minister he walked over and threw down a few black daggers. At this moment, there were more than 10 black daggers, which occupied a large area.
 Minister he was a little hesitant.
 It would be inconvenient to bring so many black banners with him.
 But if you don't bring it and leave it here, it'll belong to someone else if it's taken away. It won't be your name.
 However, outside the square, each clan had left two or three people to guard their own harvest.  He glanced at the crowd and said,""Liu Long, you, Wang Ming, Li Hao, and Liu Yan, escort these armors back ... Forget it, Wang Ming, don't go. You're a superpower, and your fluctuations are obvious. You three martial masters will be tired. Go and come back quickly!"
 Li Hao felt strange.
 Just the three of us?
 I thought you would arrange for Zhang Ting to come with us ... But you didn 't. It seems that Hao lianchuan didn't give you any instructions.
 It was normal to have three martial masters escort them back.
 However, he had brought more than ten black Phoenix with him. It was too big a target. Unless the people in the city were blind, they would definitely see it. Why would they care about the fluctuations of the superpower?
 At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt that ... This Minister he wouldn't want to kill us, would he?
 He couldn't be blamed for overthinking!
 The three of them, even Liu Long, were only at the peak of the 100-plus rank-100 level in the government. They were not at the thousand-combat level. If three of them were to escort more than ten armors back, it would be very dangerous, whether it was money or other things, if they were seen.
 Without waiting for Li Hao to speak, Huang Yun took the initiative and said,""He bu, isn't this a little dangerous? there are too many black flames, and they'll be a big target. Although the three of them are martial masters, they're not too strong ..."
 "It's fine. We've already swept the area in front of us. Even if people from other streets come over, we can quickly come back to help!"
 Minister he looked ahead and said,"let's clean up this Street first. We still have to be on guard against Tong Jia's sneak attack. Liu Long is an experienced Martial Master. At the critical moment, we can give up on the black banner and escape. It'll be easier for us to escape. It'll be fine!"
 Huang Yun still wanted to say more, but Minister he shook his head and said,""Don't say anything more. There's danger everywhere. Since we're here, we can't not take any risks ..."
 Huang Yun could only shut up.
 That's true. Actually, escorting hei Teng back would be safer than them.
  Liu Long frowned slightly, but he quickly nodded,""Alright!"
 As he said this, he dragged a few black banners. Without saying a word, Li Hao and Liu Yan each dragged a few black banners and walked back.
 After walking for a while, the darkness had already covered the people in front.
 "Minister he ... What do you mean?" Liu Long frowned and asked in a low voice.
 Although the escort mission wasn't too difficult, asking them to leave alone at this time felt like asking them to die ...
 Li Hao didn't care about this. He looked around and then looked back. Curling his lips, he said in a low voice,""Boss, don't you like to use this move? Bait! They probably think that martial masters are tough and won't be killed immediately ... These people are following us!"
 Only then did Liu Long feel relieved, but he still couldn't help but curse in a low voice,"I say! Even if he wanted to kill us ... He didn't have to be so obvious. But this bastard, he didn't even say anything!"
 He didn't have any objections to a simple greeting.
 More importantly, if Li Hao hadn't discovered it, he wouldn't have known that those people were following him. Clearly, the distance was beyond his sensing range.
 Li Hao said indifferently,"it's not the first time. Didn't boss tell me to join a demon hunting squad?" They're used as bait. "

 "Nonsense, I've asked for your opinion!"
 Liu Long was dissatisfied."I didn't arrange for you to be the bait directly. You're the one who's willing to do it, yet you're saying this now."
 Li Hao laughed."Then let's just pretend they don't exist ... Boss, how about the three of us continue to act alone? I've found a lot of fools hiding in secret. Let's go over there ... Maybe we can kill a few and get some mysterious energy. "
 At this moment, the three suns were not here.
 He wasn't afraid of black armor's appearance, so he could be bolder than before. As for the people behind him ... He would just shake them off.
 It was very easy for the three martial masters to shake them off.
 Li Hao also wanted to find an opportunity to fight a few more times and absorb some mysterious energy to see if he could advance to the warrior Qian level.
 Upon hearing this, Liu Long looked at the black armor in his hand and asked,""What do we do with these?"
 "Leave it here ... They'll naturally take it away when they follow us!"
 "You ..."
  Liu Long was speechless. He still followed the rules and wanted to return the black banner. The black banner was very valuable, but Li Hao wanted to leave it here.
 "Boss, we can't lose it! Don't worry. "
 "If you're really worried," Li Hao said,"then send it back. It's not far away, anyway."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Let's just send them back. After that, we'll think of a way to get rid of these people. Then, we'll act alone. "
 Although Li Hao felt that it was a waste of time, he still listened to Liu Long's words. The three of them continued to drag their armors forward.
 The three of them were quite a big target ... But perhaps there were too many Black Phoenix, Li Hao didn't dare to make a move even though he found one or two hidden supers along the way.
 As for Li Hao, he didn't deliberately rush into the pile of superpowers. He could see them and naturally avoid them.
 After returning to the square, Li Hao and the other two left hei Teng to the night patrol on guard. Then, they entered the darkness again. This time, Li Hao deliberately left Minister he and the others behind.
 It was uncomfortable to be with these people.
 ……
 Seventh Street.
 The three figures were extremely sneaky.
 In the darkness, Li Hao slashed with his sword. On a roof, a superpower quickly reacted and raised his hand to shoot a wooden spike. Just as he was about to counterattack, Liu Long suddenly appeared behind him and punched him!
 With this punch, the opponent's wooden spike was shattered. Li Hao's long sword burst out with sword radiance, which was exceptionally sharp.
 The earth overturning sword was truly extraordinary.
 With a slash of his sword, he killed the other party on the spot.
 "Wood-type, not bad!"
 Li Hao exhaled."It's Yama again ... Did you get into a fight with Yama today? There aren't many Yama Kings left, right?"
 With that, he sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the energy.
 Fire element, water element, earth element, metal element, wood element ... Li Hao now absorbed whatever he could grasp. The imbalance in the water element had also been mostly made up for by the previous 150 cubic meters.  This time, he had obtained more than 500 cubic meters of mysterious energy in the remains. In any case, Li Hao would absorb it whenever he had the time.
 The sword energy was already very weak.
 The sounds of killing could be vaguely heard everywhere. Li Hao looked around while absorbing the energy. The next moment, he said in a low voice,""Boss, there's a superpower under the table in the ninth room ..."
 At this moment, Liu Long was already used to it!
 In such an environment, the vision of superpowers was limited, and martial masters were just so-so.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, could see superpowers from hundreds of meters away.
 With him around, these superpowers were out of luck.
 As long as it wasn't the night patrollers or the swords gate ... They could kill anyone!
 Liu Long instantly disappeared from his spot, and Li Hao continued to absorb the mysterious energy. He was very satisfied and satisfied.
 He felt that he was really about to enter the universe.
 He had been trying to understand the terrain and even connected with the earth to feel the special fluctuations. As for his sword force, he had been growing stronger. However, he felt that he was still lacking something when it came to fusion.
 "The integration of terrain and sword force ... How exactly do you integrate them?"
 Li Hao fell into deep thought.
 "Heaven and earth ... The sword split the heaven and earth?"
 He had used his sword to split the heavens and earth. Just like what he had seen, that expert had split the sky with a single strike. It even felt like he was opening up the universe.
 However, if his sword force opened up the terrain, would it destroy the terrain?
 Li Hao was a little hesitant.
 In that case, his advantage would be gone. It seemed that it would be good to simply use the sword. It would be better for a swordsman to be pure, but Li Hao hoped that he could be both offensive and defensive, instead of only having offensive power and a lack of defensive power.
 At this moment, Li Hao was in a dilemma.
  He wanted to give it a try ... But he was afraid that if he tried, the terrain would be destroyed, and the loss would be too great.
 However, he didn't want to see it stuck at 100.
 Now, there were a bunch of people in the glorious sun realm and a large number of people in the three suns realm. There might even be people in the rising light realm above the three suns realm in the central region. He, a Martial Master who had broken through a hundred, was too weak.
 Even killing a person had to be done in secret.
 "A Martial Master ... Must advance courageously! When our boss broke through to the thousand warrior tier, I said that he was hesitating. Our teacher also said that he lacked courage. Now that it's my turn, I finally understand what it means to stand up and talk without pain in the back!"
 Li Hao laughed at himself. It was easy to talk.
 When he was talking about Liu Long, he was full of righteousness, but why was boss so sissy?
 He was so dawdling!
 When it was his turn, he realized that ... It was really a difficult choice. He was afraid that something would go wrong, and that would be troublesome.
 "If I really break the terrain ... It's nothing. At most, I'll just upgrade my sword force alone. If I can really become like that swordsman I saw ... Even one force is enough for me to kill and conquer the world!"
