        lk nonsense!"
         "Who's talking nonsense? The city of supers is guarded by a divine-tier elite, what's there to be afraid of ... Besides, it's not a secret. Even the nine divisions know about it, but they don't say anything, do they?"
         "That's true. "
         "Don't think that the three major organizations are still wanted criminals ... In a few years ... Hehe ... After they've cleared their name, they'll be the overlords of a region. They might even be conferred a throne or something ..."
         "That's the business of the big shots, it has nothing to do with us. "
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly. The three great organizations had almost cleared their name in the central continent.
         An assassin organization, flying sky, a Yama who randomly killed people, and a sinister and ruthless Red Moon. These few large organizations could also be cleared?
         Looking at these ordinary people, it seemed like they were used to it.
         "Don't worry about those things, we can't get involved. However, those with status will usually come to stellarsky city. Only those with low status will go to SuperPower City. Divine power realm is very impressive, but it's not like stellarsky city doesn't have one. Haven't you heard? The First Division Chief of the nine divisions was still alive, and it was said that they were all divine-tier powerhouses ... My God, how long have they been alive? He was a Secretary 80 years ago, he's already over 100 years old, right?"
         "Hehe, you probably don't know about this. It's said that they can live forever. In the ancient civilization, some people could even live for tens of thousands of years ..."
          "Bullshit! If he lived for tens of thousands of years, wouldn't he be able to live until now?"
         "I've only heard about it from others ... There's no accurate way of saying how long the ancient civilization has been around since the beginning ... Who knows what's going on? perhaps it's just an exaggeration, but it's true that they can live for a thousand years!"
         “……”
         To the North, most of the things these people were talking about were top secrets. But here, everyone on the streets knew about them.
         Li Hao chuckled.
         As expected, he had seen too little. The people of the central continent were much more well-informed than he had imagined.
         The convoy in front seemed to have exchanged pleasantries for a while. After that, the convoy continued to move forward at a faster speed. Li Hao was in no hurry and followed slowly.
         The road here was huge, but it was too congested.
         There were cars everywhere.
         In Silver City, even in white moon City, he had never seen so many cars.
         As he was thinking, he suddenly looked up. There was a big hole in the hood of the car. At this moment, he saw a group of people driving a spaceship-like origin god weapon and flying into the distance.
         There were also others who saw it and exclaimed in surprise,""Is it three suns or Xuguang who is personally traveling?"
         Li Hao almost laughed when he heard that.
         If he didn't go out personally, wouldn't three suns and Xu Guang go out?
         However, from what he said, it seemed that only three suns and rising light were qualified to fly?
         As he was thinking, Li Hao's eyes flickered. The next moment, a huge bird soared through the sky. There seemed to be people on the bird. Someone saw it and said excitedly,""That 's...That's the people from heavenly Peng group! That bird, was it the Tian Peng group's most famous Storm Bird? It's said that these birds are at least at the level of a sun glory expert ..."
         "The heavenly Peng group ... The one that works for the heavenly Peng sacred mountain?"
          "That's right. Who else can control these bird demons besides them?" This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "People from the seven great divine mountains ... Are they also going to Sky Star City? The seven sacred mountains are all independent, why didn't they go to the city of superpower? I don't think the seven sacred mountains need to attend the Academy. They have their own businesses in the superpower City and are the financial backers of some Academies ..."
         All of them were well-informed.
         Li Hao was enjoying it. Without a communication Jade, he didn't know the situation in the central continent. At this moment, ordinary people from all directions gave him some general knowledge.
         Heavenly Peng mountain!
         He knew about this. It was said that his master was a sky ROC great demon, an extremely powerful existence.
         He had once swallowed Xuguang ... That was a long time ago, and Li Hao had heard of it several times.
         And before Yuan Shuo left, he had instructed the Black Panther to kill it ... His teacher was also afraid that the Black Panther would not die.
         At this moment, Black Panther also raised his head and looked up. He was a little lazy and could not lift his spirits.
         What a weak bird!
         It couldn't be bothered to look at it.
         In the air, the huge bird suddenly felt something and was on the verge of falling. The next moment, it flapped a few times and looked like it was about to fall. A human aura burst out from the bird and instantly stabilized the falling situation.
         ……
         In the sky.
         There were people on the giant bird, and not just one. It was a three yang middle-aged man who frowned slightly.""What's going on?"
         Why did this Gale bird suddenly almost fall down?
         He looked around and frowned, but he didn't sense anything. An expert sneak attacked?
          That was unlikely.
         They were representing the heavenly Peng mountain. Besides, this was the central region. Who would dare to attack the people of the heavenly Peng mountain here?
         At this moment, the giant bird was a little muddleheaded, but it continued to move forward. After flying past the area just now, the giant bird returned to normal. It was just a sunlit giant bird, and it couldn't use spiritual voice transmission.
         For a moment, no one knew what was going on.
         However, this sunbeak knew that ... There might have been a top-notch great demon down there!
         Yes, it could vaguely feel a little, which frightened it.
         The giant bird didn't dare to stay and quickly disappeared.
         ……
         In the car.
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows and looked at Black Panther. He suddenly frowned and said,""Restrain that ancient demon bloodline power of yours! Stop showing off! By the time we reach stellarsky city, I haven't been exposed yet, but you've been exposed first. When I encounter a demon, I have to kowtow to you?"
        
         “……”
         Heibao was somewhat innocent!
         I didn't do it on purpose, so I'm not interested in these little demons.
         But ... Forget it, it didn't make sense.
         Soon, the Black Panther wagged its tail. Li Hao didn't know if it had restrained itself, but he thought it had. He said,""Make it smaller, the size of a puppy."
         The Black Panther was unmoved.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao sneered,"don't think I don't know that you can change your size!" I've stayed in your stomach before, and your internal organs have almost become steel. They will become small when compressed, but they will become big when relaxed! Hurry up!"
         The Black Panther howled.
         He didn't want to!
         "Speed ... You're quite famous now."
          Black Panther was extremely depressed, but for the sake of his good days in the future, he still had tears in his eyes. After a moment, he compressed himself into a little puppy.
         Li Hao laughed.
         As for himself, he didn't change much. He just changed his clothes and looked like a central continent person. No one would be able to tell that he was from the North at a glance.
         Li Hao's short hair had grown a lot recently, and he had grown a little beard. Those who were not too familiar with him would not be able to recognize him at first sight. Even if they were acquaintances, when they saw the current Li Hao ... They would treat him like an artist.
         Li Hao, who was wearing glasses, had a puppy by his side, had long hair, and a small beard ... If he were to go to school, he could be an art teacher.
         Not only that, but he also completely blocked silver armor from the southern Fist.
         This was to prevent the southern Fist from calling him again. In that case, the southern Fist would know if he was a thousand miles away.
         The southern Fist couldn't locate Li Hao, but Li Hao could.
         That fellow seemed to have returned to stellarsky city.
         Company commander tonggong's authority was still low.
         Just like that, Li Hao listened and stopped along the way. Like an ordinary person, he walked and stopped, listening to the gossip. Although he didn't hear much business, he did hear a lot of gossip.
         The fact that they were in the mood to gossip meant that they were actually Living a Good Life. In fact, those who drove, took a car, and had the intention to go to Tian Xing city were actually not living too bad.
         ……
         At the same time.
         The stellarsky city was also bustling with activity.
         The stellarsky city was always so lively.
         The streets and alleys were filled with people and cars.
         Compared to Silver Moon, Sky Star city's skyscrapers were everywhere. There were too many people, so they could only rely on the skyscrapers to split up.
          However, not all of them were tall buildings.  There weren't many tall buildings in the center of the stellarsky city.
         A huge Imperial Palace stood in the center, surrounded by black-armored guards. This was the famous black-armored Army of the past. Now, they were no longer fighting, but protecting the imperial family who had retreated behind the scenes.
         Outside the Imperial Palace, there was a long road, and on both sides of the road, there were many low-rise buildings. No one remembered what it was called back then, but now, everyone in heavenstar knew that this was the Jiusi Street.
         The nine divisions were like Nine Dragons swallowing a Pearl, surrounding the entire Palace.
         In the vast stellarsky city, Jiu si Street and the Imperial Palace occupied a large amount of land. There were no tall buildings here, and the highest one was no more than six stories. They were built in recent years, and most of them were retro-or rather, ancient-looking.
         The sky was also gradually turning dark.
         However, the entire stellarsky city didn't look like it was going to get dark. The lights were brilliant, as if they were white.
         On the nine Streets of Jiusi Street, the people who came and went were all in a hurry. Almost all of them were either supers or martial masters.
         This was where true experts were as common as clouds.
         Perhaps one of the unremarkable people was three suns, or Dou Qian.
         The Imperial City had centralized power for 200 years, gathering countless wealth and countless elites.
         At this moment, in the night patrolman's residence.
         Hou Xiaochen's office.
         Three young men walked in casually, one with a knife, one with a gun, and one with a woman.
         She had a small head and big eyes. She blinked and acted cute the moment she entered."Minister, you were looking for us? It's already late at night. Is the Head of Department going to treat us to dinner? You haven't even treated us to a meal since you took office. I know a place that has really good food ..."
         Her big eyes blinked, and she looked confused.
         Hou Xiaochen smiled but didn't say anything. On the side, Chief Steward Yu poured a cup of tea for hou Xiaochen. When he looked at big eyes, a killing intent suddenly appeared in his eyes. Big eyes "heart trembled, but his expression didn't change.
          However, he could not help but curse in his heart. This old woman ... Was really fierce!
         I'm so cute, why are you glaring at me like that?
         However, Yu Luosha had killed countless people, so it was normal for her to be a little fierce.
         "What's wrong, sister Yu? Her eyes were uncomfortable? Do you want to go and have your eyes checked?"
         When Chief Steward Yu heard this, he suddenly laughed and said softly,""There's no need to worry. You're all the treasures of the night patrollers. The Minister would like to meet you and chat about your daily life. At the same time, he would like to see if you're as good as the rumors say."
         "I've only seen the three of you among the four heroes of the night watchmen. Why haven't I seen the other one?"he said in a more serious tone.
         The big-eyed man blinked and laughed,"you mean the little Daoist?" Didn't sister Yu know that he was in seclusion? The little Daoist was in the late stage of the rising light realm and was about to reach the peak. This time, he will probably be at the peak of the rising light realm ... He might even be in the metamorphosis stage. The little Daoist is really powerful ..."
         "Sister Yu, do you want to call him out? this little Daoist is very powerful."
         Before Chief Steward Yu could say anything, hou Xiaochen laughed,"Alright, I'll go into seclusion then. It's pretty good."
         After he finished speaking, he looked at the three of them and revealed a friendly smile.""What have you three been busy with recently? I heard that they're following Blue Moon?"
        
         Saber and spear didn't make a sound.
         The big-eyed man laughed and said,"that's right. Everyone has the right to kill the people from the three great organizations!" We've received intelligence that Blue Moon has come to stellarsky city. Perhaps she's plotting something, so we're chasing after her ... Unfortunately, this fellow is hiding in a secret place, and we haven't seen him yet. "
         "I heard that qingyue is also a member of the Silver Moon clan. Sister Yu and Minister hou should know the identity and appearance of the Silver Moon Martial Master, right?" Why don't big sister Yu bring us to look for ..."
         "There's no rush,"hou Xiaochen laughed," one blue Moon won't be able to cause much trouble. "
         "The higher-ups have recently given me a new mission, and you all probably know about it ..."
         "I know, I know. Minister, do you want us to hunt down the members of the three major organizations?"
         "Sure, we like it. However, the three major organizations are mainly gathered in the city of superpower. There are divine-tier elites there. Why don't you hold the fort for us? we can go to the city of superpower to have some fun ..." The big-eyed man smiled.
         Chief Steward Yu's eyes turned cold. She didn't like these people, especially this big-eyed one. He had no manners!
         She interrupted before hou Xiaochen could finish his sentence, which was not good.
         Even in Silver Moon, the famous devil sword would not speak to hou Xiaochen in such a manner.
          Of course, she knew that this was the central region.
         But ... So what?
         Chief Steward Yu's eyes were cold as he stared at the big eye. In an instant, the three of them felt a killing intent and their hearts trembled slightly.
         "Cough, cough, cough ..."
         Hou Xiaochen coughed and looked at chief Yu. Chief Yu retracted his killing intent and didn't look at them again. He sat down quietly and continued with his work.
         The three of them were also slightly shocked.
         According to the information, Yu Luosha was only at the mid-stage of the rising light realm, while the three of them were at the late-stage of the rising light realm. They were even approaching the peak of the rising light realm. Moreover, they were all god tier Masters blessed by the heavens and had even killed existences at the peak of the rising light realm.
         Once they reached the peak of the rising light Stage, they might be able to fight those at the transformation stage.
         However, just now ... He was actually intimidated by the killing intent.
         Sure enough, these old martial masters weren't easy to deal with. They had killed countless people, and their killing intent was really strong.
         Furthermore, unlike Huang Long and the others, who were only half-coaxing him and hou Xiaochen, Yu Luosha's attitude wasn't very good.
         Hou Xiaochen coughed for a while before speaking again with a smile,"The city of supers is a little far away. We don't even know the situation in the stellarsky city. We can leave the city of supers for a while ..."
         ,m Hou Xiaochen paused for a moment. Seeing that the big-eyed man didn't interject anymore, he smiled."I'll focus my attention on stellarsky city ..."  At this moment, the saber-wielding youth said,""What does the Minister want us to do?"
         He was not afraid of anything and said in a deep voice,""If we can do it, we will naturally do it. If we can't do it ... The Minister will find someone else!"
         "Actually, it's nothing much. I just want to confirm and clarify the functions of the star Governor. The night watchers are the only super organization confirmed by the nine Imperial families and have the power to enforce the law."
         "As for the star Governor, he governs all the supernatural organizations in the central region and manages all supernatural organizations. Extraordinary people ..."
         "However, right now ... No one knows about this. Even if we arrested some people a few days ago, it was not of much use. Because those who did not have enough status were arrested and killed. Our authority is still not enough."
         The three of them were shocked!
         Still not enough?
         You've killed the brother of the Duke of dingguo, put many people of the Xu family in prison, and dealt with the vice principal of the tenseng Academy ... Isn't that enough?
         Who else could have a higher status?
         The head and Deputy of the nine divisions?
         The imperial family, the Dukes, the princes, and even the princes and princesses?
         Or the Academy's President?
         They didn't know what hou Xiaochen was trying to do. Was he just trying to establish his authority?
         Would it work?
         In fact, they didn't even know why hou Xiaochen had come to the central continent ... Did you really think that you, hou Xiaochen, were immortal?
         The three of them were reckless but not stupid.
         There were too many things involved in this and it was extremely dangerous. After the divine power realm was made public, the three of them knew that perhaps ... If they acted rashly, they would provoke the divine power!
         Where's hou Xiaochen?
         Even after unsealing it, it would not reach the level of a sacred art.
         The big-eyed man stopped smiling and his smile disappeared."Minister hou, who do you want to ... Deal with?"
         Hou Xiaochen laughed,"it's not that I want to, it's the law, it's the rules, it's the power!" It's not my personal opinion, but the entire night patrol should be like this. They should be sure of their law enforcement power and not always be in a mess. Now, look, do the night patrol have any authority as the only law enforcement agency?"
         The three of them were silent.
         Seeing this, hou Xiaochen sighed,"forget it. From the looks of it, you guys don't have that kind of courage. The other one, on the other hand, dared to kill the Yama's grandson. Wait until he comes out, then you guys can discuss it."
         He was obviously goading them!
          However, they still chose to remain silent.  Hou Xiaochen's eyes narrowed with a bit of regret ... It seemed that he wasn't completely fearless.
         That's right, he was really too stupid. How could he have survived until now?
         "You guys can go ahead."
         "Minister, we ..."
         The saber-wielding man seemed to be at a loss. He wanted to say something, but hou Xiaochen laughed, "It's fine, go!"
         The big-eyed man stopped smiling. He seemed to be struggling, but he nodded and said,""Then we'll take our leave first!"
         With that, the three of them turned around and left.
         After they left, Chief Steward Yu said lightly,""In the end, he still lacks some courage ..."
         "You can't say that!" Hou Xiaochen laughed. We're not familiar with them. These little guys don't lack talent, strength, and courage. It's just that they're strangers after all. They're not stupid and they're not willing to be our blades. "
         "Minister, why didn't you say a few more words? perhaps you could have moved them?"
         "The three of them are not the core. Among the four of them, the one who is in seclusion is. He was the one who killed Yama's grandson and took the heaven Dao ruler. If he doesn't come out of seclusion, these three ... Will do small things, but not overstep their boundaries in big things."
         Chief Steward Yu felt a little regretful, but then he thought of something and said with a smile,""It's a pity that Li Hao didn't come, or else ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Don 't!"
         "I'll be having a headache if he comes!"Hou Xiaochen laughed. He looked like a coward before, but when he went to the East, I knew that he was the second Yuan Shuo. No, in fact, he was even crazier than Yuan Shuo ... When he came, he would find trouble for me before I could even say anything!"
         "That's true. "
         ……
         At the same time.
         Outside the stellarsky city.
         Li Hao crossed the star sea and looked at the magnificent city in the distance. He smiled."Hou bu, I've come to see you!"
         There were too few acquaintances in the huge stellarsky city.
         He didn't want to go to the southern Fist.
         That could only be hou Xiaochen and the others.
         Yes, Li Hao didn't plan to sneak around. He wanted to open his eyes to see the world. His status was too low.
         He had to find someone with a high status to see this world!
         Therefore, he had already decided to go find hou Xiaochen. He would see his fellow townsmen with tears in his eyes. "I'm sure the Marquis will be very happy to see me. And then there's Jin spear, Mu Lin, chief Yu ..."
         They will be very happy to see me here.
         "A month late ... Good, I'm not too late!"
         Li Hao could imagine how excited, excited, happy, and admiring everyone would be when they saw him ...
         I just caused a ruckus in the Duke dingguo's mansion, so everyone must be very envious and admiring.
         A moment later, Li Hao arrived in stellarsky city.
         In an instant, it was as if he had crossed into another world.
         Flourishing!
         It was a hubbub of voices!
         Some were flying, some were walking, and some were driving ...
         There were tall buildings and roads everywhere.
         People came and went, and it was very lively.
          If one didn't come to stellarsky city, one would never know that a city could be so prosperous. Under the night sky, the lights were brilliant. Not far away, superpowers were performing magic. Further away, there were even superpowers chasing away small demons for the people around.
         In this place, was this the only way for superpowers and demons?
         The high and mighty superpowers, the demon race, could only earn a living like this?
         A group of people wearing the patrol office uniform came from the end of the street. There were more than ten of them, and the first level patrol officer in the lead was actually a riyao ... Riyao ... Was he just a first level patrol officer?
         Li Hao's eyes were dazzled. For a moment, he only felt that his knowledge was too shallow!
         He looked around ... Where was the night patrolman headquarters?
         In such a big city, where could he find people?
         "There should be someone who knows where the headquarters is ..."
         Li Hao thought to himself as he led the little black Panther into the city. This was only the outskirts of the city, but he was already shocked.
         Sky Star City, here I come!
        
         The stellarsky city was extremely large.
         Li Hao, who had just arrived, was like an idiot ... He had no choice, he was dizzy.
         He asked for directions.
         Other people told him which bus to take, how to transfer, which bus to go ...
         Li Hao understood.
         And then ... F * cking hell, there were too many cars and too many people. He was dizzy from all the spinning.
         Just as he was getting dizzy from the spinning, a short girl who looked to be around 15 or 16 years old suddenly winked at him and said,""Hey, little brother, do you need a tour guide?"
         “……”
         ? Another fatty?
         Li Hao suddenly thought of the person he had met before and frowned.
          Do I look that gullible?
         You want to trick me into killing anyone you see?
         'F * ck, are all the people in the central continent like this?
         This was the core of the star dynasty. Were there such people who lived in the open?
         His eyes could not help but reveal some killing intent.
         Such a young child ... Although Li Hao was only 20 years old, he still felt that such a young child was so bad. This city instantly made him loathe them!
         The girl didn't look like she was dressed very well. She was a little worn out, but she was very clean. Even some of the tears were sewn neatly and flowers were embroidered on her, even though she was a little ugly ...
         As if she was frightened by Li Hao's gaze, the girl mumbled,""If you don't want it, then don 't. What's the point of scaring people?"
         Li Hao exhaled.
         Once bitten by a snake, twice shy.
         The first time he met the fatty, he trusted him very much and felt that the world was full of love. In the end, he was almost tricked into mining. At this moment, he was more vigilant.
         However, he remembered that this was the Imperial City. This girl ... It seemed like he couldn't take what he saw with his eyes seriously.
         But at this moment, Li Hao was indeed a little confused. He didn't care if it was a scammer. He said,""Do you know how to get to Jiusi Street?"
         The girl's eyes lit up!
         "Of course! I'm well-versed in the maps of Tian Xing city, and I'm familiar with Jiu si Street. Are you only going to one place or many places?"
         "Let's go to Jiusi Street. If we can't find him, we'll see. "
         " 100 star dollars! Pay for the travel expenses. "
         100 star coins ... In the past, Li Hao thought that it was a lot, but now that he was in the central continent, he realized that it was really little.
         As for taking a taxi ... Li Hao, who had just come out of the village, didn't know anything about taking a taxi.
         In fact, there was a taxi nearby.
         However, whether it was white moon City or Silver City, the cars were all owned by the rich and powerful. Li Hao couldn't come to his senses that the rich and powerful didn't want to be their driver.
         "Alright!"
         Li Hao nodded.
         The girl glanced at him. Is he a fool?  A foreigner?
         Probably!
         When she heard that the other party wanted to go to Jiusi Street, she thought that the business had gone down and wasn't too interested. Thus, she casually offered 100 star coins. In reality, 70 to 80 star coins would be enough to take a taxi there ... In the end, this fool actually agreed!
         However, on second thought ... The foreigners might not know how much it was to take a taxi.
         As she thought about it, the girl suddenly smiled brightly."Then come with me ... Jiusi Street is quite far. I'll find you a cheaper way to travel. I guarantee you'll save money!"
         Li Hao didn't mind.
         At this moment, he took in a deep breath. This lousy place ... He really didn't want to come. It was built so big, and he, the mighty demon Sword, actually got lost in this city. No one would believe it if he told them!
         He followed the girl from the bus stop and walked to the side.
         At this moment, Li Hao was fearless!
         "If anyone dares to lie to me in old hou's territory, I'll kill them all with a single sword strike and throw them to old hou to deal with!
         He knew that many people wanted to kill him!
         However, Li Hao understood that these great forces still needed a little bit of so-called face. As a member of the nine divisions and a senior city inspector, these people would not dare to touch him in public!
         It was precisely because he had made up his mind that Li Hao dared to come to stellarsky city.
         As for what was going on in the dark ... Li Hao was also thinking.
         With Nan Quan and hou Xiaochen around, if they really did fight, he would be responsible for suppressing the seal. These two wouldn't have to be afraid of sacred-power realm beings.
         As he thought about this, he followed the girl into an alley.
         A cold smile appeared on his face ...
         In the next moment, he could not laugh anymore.
         He was speechless!
         The girl pushed out a worn-out bicycle from the alley. When she saw Li Hao looking at her, she quickly explained,""Traffic jam! You don't know, but there's a traffic jam on Jiusi Street! It's at least two hours by car, and it's fast by bike, half an hour at most ... The fee is low, just give me 10 yuan!"
         "You'll bring me?"
         "Yeah!"
         The girl said matter-of-factly,"of course, I'll take you! It's 10 yuan, and it's the same as a public bus. The public bus is also congested ... I see that you're from another city and aren't familiar with this place. I'll ride you around and introduce you to Tian Xing city!"
          “……”
         Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
         Bicycle ... I used to ride a bicycle every day when I went to work. It's a pity that the bicycle I've been riding for so many years is now in that big house in Silver City. I don't know if it has been taken away.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "That's fine, as long as you've delivered it!"
         Li Hao didn't bother to say anything. It's good to ride a bike. I'll look around and see where I'm going. Otherwise, I don't even know where to run to if I'm being hunted down in this damn place.
         At this moment, even Li Hao was considering a way out.
         As for why he was being hunted down in stellarsky city ... Who knew?
         The girl was overjoyed. She quickly got into the car and patted the back seat.""Get in the car! By the way, you have to hold the dog ..."
         "Where's your luggage?"
         "I didn 't."
        
         "You don't have any luggage?"
         The girl was a little surprised, but she quickly understood.""You have a place to stay here, right? You'll have to come back later ... If you come back, you can come and find me. "
         Li Hao smiled. He didn't say anything and sat in the back seat.
         He didn't say that he would ride it.
         I spent money on it!
         Besides, I don't know the way.
         Of course, looking at their small arms and legs, there was a high probability that they wouldn't be able to carry him. He and the Black Panther added together weighed at least 800 to 1000 pounds.
         The girl had already started riding after hanging a little in the air. After riding for a while, she turned around and said,""Why are you so light ..."
         "Look at the road!"
         Li Hao was speechless. A big bike passed by in a flash. Don't you look at where you're going when you're riding?
          The girl quickly turned around. She was not afraid and was rather bold. At this time, she did not forget that she was invited to be a tour guide. She raised her chin and said,"look, that's the most famous place in Dongcheng. It's the Elysian world. Hehe ... You guys all like to go there. It's all over the street and I heard that it's not expensive ..."
         Li Hao was indifferent.
         The girl rode here and there. Although Li Hao was almost floating, she was also quite tired. It seemed that her physique wasn't very good. Along the way, she introduced Li Hao to the situation in all directions.
         Li Hao listened quietly and remembered.
         Soon, there were fewer skyscrapers.
         "There are nine Streets on Jiusi Street," the girl continued,"which one are you going to? What was the exact location? Every street is very, very long ... And they're all in different directions. "
         "Inspector, night patrol."
         "Eh? Where do you want to go?"
         The girl was surprised."That's where the supers live. You're going to look for them?"
         "Yes,"
         "You're a superhuman too?"
         The girl denied it,"no way?" If you have superpowers, you wouldn't dare to go there. Are you going to find your friends or relatives?"
         "We can be considered friends."
         "Oh, then be careful."
         The girl lowered her voice and said,"I heard that a few days ago, a new minister came to the night patrol. He's very fierce. Just a few days ago, he killed a lot of people ... Not only did he kill people, but he also went to cause trouble at tengxing Academy!" That's the Royal Academy. I heard that this person probably won't live for long ... Your accent sounds like you're from the North. Could the people you're looking for be the people he brought here?"
         Then, the girl said in fear,""Let me remind you, it's best not to look for those people he brought with him ... People said that they can forget about returning to the North alive!"
         Li Hao frowned."This is the Imperial City. How can they be so bold?"
         "What's wrong with the Imperial City?"
          The girl didn't think much of it. "There are many dark places under the Imperial City! Let me tell you, just last year, a Big Shot died outside the palace, saying that he fell into the waterway and drowned ... Tsk, we all know that he was a super, who would believe that! It's a pity that no one dared to investigate, so it's fine if he's dead. It's said that he colluded with the royal family ..."  The girl immediately shut her mouth. After a while, she said,""I'm just talking nonsense, don't take it seriously. Also, if you're really from the North, leave immediately after you've seen your friends. Your friend isn't some Big Shot, is he? If it's just a small character, a small soldier, it probably won't be a problem. "
         Li Hao smiled.
         This girl's mouth was really loose.
         He dared to say anything.
         He had only thought of the place and didn't need to bother with the child, but now he couldn't help but ask,""How did you know I was looking for a tour guide?"
         "One look and I can tell you're an outsider!"
         “……”
         Was it that obvious?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was puzzled,"did I dress wrong?" Or what? I don't think I'm any different from the other people at the bus stop, right?"
         The girl said disapprovingly,"the difference is huge!" The others are either reading their newspapers or waiting in peace, while you look around as if ... Cough, cough, you don't know how to go. "
         He was almost a country bumpkin entering the city.
         "Also, other people are walking on the crosswalk, but you're running on the road. Looking at you, have you never walked on such a big road before?"
         “……”
         Li Hao laughed. He was being looked down on, but it didn't matter.
         "You're so young and you're already out here to earn money?"
         "Who's young?"
         The girl was unhappy, but when she remembered that this was her sugar daddy, she immediately smiled and said,""Isn't it good to come out early and earn money to support the family?"
          "You're right. "
         "You're not studying?"
         "They're all from the Imperial City," Li Hao said."They have a good education. You should be studying at your age, right?"
         "Studying ..."
         "Tsk!"
         The girl snorted," 20 years ago, studying was useful, but what's the use now?" Unless he went to one of those super Academies, it was useless even if he came out! Being an official now doesn't depend on how much you study or if you can read ... It depends on how strong you are!"
         "If you're strong, people will fight to have you! If you're not strong, it's useless even if you have the ability! For example, there's a teacher in my previous school. He's well-versed in astronomy and geography, but the school closed down. A few days ago, I even saw the teacher selling vegetables in the market. "
         "Looking at you, you're educated? You want to find a job in the Imperial City?"
         The girl continued,"don't get your hopes up. Now that superpowers are on the rise, we ordinary people don't have much of a chance anymore. You should just get to work. One of them is worth a hundred of you!" They've already used their superpowers. In the past, when you built a house, you still needed workers. Now, superpowers can do it in a few moments. "
         "What's the use of studying? Be a teacher, and then the school closes down, and you sell vegetables? As an accountant, even if you're good at math, you're not as good as a superhuman. You've been calculating for half a day, but they've finished reading it in a glance ... Find a superhuman to come once a month and work for you for a month. It's not expensive either. "
        
         The girl sighed."That's why ... With the rise of superpowers, don't be fooled by the skyscrapers and the prosperity. People like us are getting worse and worse. In the past, we could still fill our stomachs, but now ... It's too difficult to earn money!"
         Li Hao was slightly dazed, but then he nodded.
         That's true!
         Previously, Hong Yitang had said that superpowers should do something for the people, but now that they were in stellarsky city, Li Hao suddenly realized that the more superpowers there were, the more space the ordinary people would have to live in.
         There was no more hard labor, no more brainwork, no more use in studying, and it was even more difficult to eat than before.
         With the price of goods skyrocketing, it would only become more and more difficult if one was not capable.
         Li Hao fell into deep thought.
         "Then, do you think superpowers are a good or bad thing?"
         "It's a good thing that I have superpowers. It's a bad thing that I don't have them!"
         The girl did not hesitate at all,"no, that's terrible!" If there was, it would be very comfortable. Those officials should restrict these supers and not let them take our work!"
          "Or find us something to do. Not everyone can become a superpower ... We're starving."
         Li Hao nodded slightly. That was true.
         At this time, the bicycle had reached an area with an ancient feel to it.
         "Get out of the car," the girl said."Except for officials, no one can drive or ride over. We can only walk over. Also, don't look around, or you'll be caught as a bad person and you'll be finished. "
         "Oh right, if you see anyone dressed in fancy clothes, don't look at them. They're all important people. Be careful not to be captured or killed. They might just charge you with the crime of being a member of the three major organizations ... No one will help you seek justice anyway."
         Li Hao frowned."You dare to do this under the nose of the nine divisions?" he asked.
         "Of course, it's fine as long as he has a background!"
         Li Hao's furrowed brows relaxed. That's right, he'll get used to it.
         It seemed that everyone was used to it.
         Privileges had been deeply rooted in people's hearts.
         Li Hao didn't ask any more questions. He got off the bicycle, and the girl pushed the bicycle to park the car. Li Hao raised his head and looked ahead. There was a large road that led straight into the depths, like a man-eating abyss.
         This Avenue was very long, and there was a road name on the side of the road. However, it was not Jiusi Street, nor was it Patrol office Street. It was just a common name.
         The official name of this place was Jiulong Street.
         The nine Dragons spitting out pearls, protecting the imperial family.
         Of course, the protection from back then had now become an encirclement.
         The girl stopped her broken bicycle and quickly jogged over, smiling.""I said it's not far, right? if you take a taxi, it'll take at least an hour. The traffic will be so bad that you'll die!"  "By the way, look after your dog. Don't poop or pee here, or it'll be troublesome!"
         She gave a few more words of advice and pointed to the front."This is the street of the inspection Office. There are many organizations under the inspection Office here. The night patrolman is in front, not far from the inspection Office headquarters."
         After saying that, he stepped onto the street. Instead of walking along the middle, he walked to the side and turned to Li Hao."Go to the side. Only the important people can walk in the middle. Those who can walk in the middle are all extraordinary ... When we can walk up there one day, we won't have to be like this anymore. "
         The two sides of the street were slightly dark.
         In addition to these official institutions, there were also houses and shops here. However, business did not seem to be so good in the most prosperous area in the center. It was cold and quiet, and there were people on both sides of the road.
         However, it seemed that many of them, like Li Hao, were just tourists who came to see the majestic streets of the inspection Office.
         In fact, Li Hao's eyes were almost blinded!
         So many light orbs!
         In other words, they were so densely packed that he could hardly distinguish between the strong and the weak. He only felt that the front was brighter than daytime. He blinked his eyes and the light in his eyes disappeared.
         He was afraid that he would be blind if he continued to look.
         This was a technique that he had only recently mastered. In the past, he could only watch passively. Now, he could control it a little. If he didn't want to watch, he could block it.
         There were too many experts!
         As expected of the core area of the dynasty. This was also the location of the inspection Office and the headquarters of the night patrollers. There were countless rays of dawn here, and there might even be many sixth-level existences.
         However, when Li Hao walked on the street, he felt something special.
         Someone ... Or perhaps a treasure was scanning him.
          Was this similar to the monitoring system of the high Duke's public house?
         It made sense. This place was so important, but it still allowed people to walk around. Clearly, Jiusi was confident that it could solve all the problems.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, it was of no use to Li Hao.
         He was a Martial Master, and a powerful one at that.
         In addition, he had the bronze mirror on him and had absorbed a lot of the mysterious dark energy, so he couldn't find anything when he used it to check himself.
         He looked left and right, not following the girl's instructions to not look around.
         It was only right to be curious.
         What did a child know?
         The girl didn't seem to be very familiar with this place. She knew the distribution of some institutions, but it seemed that she rarely came here. She led Li Hao forward and said carefully,""This place is filled with officials and nobles. The road to the Imperial Palace is at the end of the road ... Don't run around. You can't go there. The imperial family ... In any case, don't get close, or you'll be dead!"
         Li Hao nodded slightly and took out two notes from his pocket.""We're here, I know how to get there. 200 star dollars, keep the change!"
        
         The girl was overjoyed!
         He hurriedly took the money and touched his pocket, only to find that there was no change. He said awkwardly,""Then ... Then I won't be polite! You're such a forthright person, big brother. Next time if you need anything, call me at any time ... Oh right, my name is Yuqi, I'm mainly in the East City to bring customers ... It's a little ... A little scary here ... When big brother goes to the East City, he can just find any child to bring customers, and they'll know where I am ..."
         After he finished speaking, he turned around and ran without looking back. It was obvious that he had wanted to run for a long time.
         If it wasn't to earn some money, he wouldn't have dared to come here.
         Li Hao smiled. He was being generous for once. It was 200 star dollars.
         However, it was rare to meet someone who wasn't a bad person, so he was in a good mood. At least he had really brought him here.
         He put the Black Panther down and carried it. This fellow was actually quite heavy.
         With a wave of his hand, a hat appeared in his hand. He put on the tall hat, and with a wave of his hand, a sword appeared in his hand, which instantly turned into a walking stick ... No, a scepter!
         It seemed that all the nobles dressed like this?
         Who knows!
          Li Hao smiled and strode toward the place where the balls of light had been.
         There were also some people on the street.
         There were also some patrol officers in the patrol office's uniform who seemed to be on patrol. Seeing Li Hao's attire and the leashed Black Panther ... They were not captured as the girl had said, but were instead ignored.
         Those who walked their dogs on the street of the inspection Office were usually not ordinary people, and no one dared to provoke them.
         Seeing this, Li Hao became even more daring and walked to the middle of the street. Behind him, the Black Panther obediently followed.
         Just like that, a man and a dog walked down the street of the inspection Office in an imposing manner.
         After walking for some distance, a large house appeared in front of them. It took up a large area, and there were people on duty outside. They were wearing the uniform of the night patrol.
         The uniform of the night patrolmen was slightly different from that of the inspection Office, but the difference was not big.
         Only a professional like Li Hao could recognize it at a glance.
         Li Hao walked to the entrance. There were six supers on duty outside the mansion. They weren't weak, but they weren't too strong either. They were all in the sunlight realm.
         Such a formation reflected the Imperial City's power.
         In Silver Moon, even sunlight could be the Vice-Minister.
         Seeing Li Hao walking over with a dog, the supers on duty frowned slightly. However, seeing Li Hao's calm expression, they did not make things difficult for him. Someone said in a deep voice,""This is an important place for the night patrolmen ... You can't trespass! If there's a case, report it to the inspection Division ..."
         Li Hao flipped his hand, and a token appeared. It was an advanced patrol token.
         The moment they saw the token, they were slightly stunned.
         Advanced city Patrol!
         He wasn't a low-level official anymore, but ... He wasn't familiar with the person in front of him!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Not from the headquarters?
         From the nearby provinces?
         "Sir, you are ..."
         Someone came forward to ask. Li Hao smiled and said,""I'm here to make a report. The Head of Department asked me to come. Isn't it too late?"
         "Minister ... May I ask ... Which Minister is this?"
         To report on work!  "Minister hou Xiaochen!"
         The man was slightly startled and then a little surprised, but he didn't dare to say anything. He hurriedly said,""Minister hou is working in the Minister's building!"
         "My Lord, do you need me to lead the way?" he asked.
         "No need!"
         Li Hao refused and walked in. After a few steps, he turned around and said to the others,""Don't you want to verify your identity?"
         The few people outside the door were stunned. Someone laughed dryly."No need!"
         What a joke!
         Someone dared to impersonate a high-level city patroller in the night patrollers 'headquarters?
         If that was the case ... Then he would just be courting death!
         Li Hao also laughed. He was confident enough ... But ... Also stupid enough!
         If I really come, even if I die in the end and kill a group of people, won't it still be a threat?
         There was no need to verify his identity.
         That's good!
         He wanted to give the Minister a surprise.
         ……
         The moment Li Hao stepped into the night watchman's courtyard ...
         In the Minister's building.
         The chief, who looked like a Buddha statue, was making tea and drinking kungfu tea. As the name suggested, they only worked at night. Therefore, they worked at night.
         However, this Minister usually came at night for tea and went to meetings during the day or went home to sleep.
         At this moment, he was brewing tea when he suddenly looked up.
         The next moment, he gently knocked on the table.""Little ye!"
         A moment later, a young woman came in and said respectfully,""Minister!"
          The old man continued to make tea and said slowly,"let's go outside and see if old Qin is here. He said he was coming to drink tea. I haven't seen him yet ... See if something happened and he's been delayed ..."
         "Alright, I'll go immediately!"
         The woman didn't say anything and walked out directly. She was puzzled.
         When did Minister Qin say he wanted to have tea?
         The Head of the Department was muddled, and his memory had deteriorated.
         He walked out of the office and went downstairs to look outside. Although he felt that the department head had remembered wrongly, he still looked around and didn't see Minister Qin. He was about to go to the other department heads 'buildings when he saw the guy walking towards him.
         It's so late at night ... He must be crazy!
         Wearing a windbreaker, a high hat, and holding a scepter ... What was he thinking?
         Xiao Ye was laughing in her heart when the Minister's voice suddenly came from upstairs.""Little ye, come on up. I seem to have remembered wrongly!"
         On the window, the old man stuck his head out and shouted. Xiao Ye heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that he still remembered.
        
         The old man glanced forward.
         He saw Li Hao.
         Li Hao, who had a strange appearance.
         The old man was a little confused and surprised. He then looked at the puppy behind Li Hao and frowned. Where did this young man come from? where did this demon come from?
         Li Hao also felt that someone was looking at him. He raised his head.
         Not far away, a white-haired head appeared on the window of a small building.
         Li Hao took a look and frowned.
         The night patrolman was not simple!
         He didn't see anything. Even his eyes didn't see anything special, but ... He could feel it. It was the aura of a powerful expert.
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
          In the distance, the old man was a little surprised. He could feel it!
         Who ... Was this person?
         He entered the night patrolman's headquarters openly ... From the looks of it, he was going to hou Xiaochen's place. The Martial Master, the great demon, the young man, the sword intent ...
         At this moment, even the old man could not help but be surprised!
         He?
         No way!
         This was impossible!
         The extremely calm old man retracted his head at this moment. He was in disbelief. He returned to his seat, drank a cup of tea, and then laughed!
         Demonic sword?
         It can't be!
         Even he would not have thought that the demonic sword would appear in stellarsky city and in the night patrol's headquarters so openly. However, on second thought, he realized that the other party was a provincial governor. Logically speaking, he should be here to report his work.
         There didn't seem to be a problem!
         But ... But you've just caused such a huge disaster in the East ...
         "Hou Xiaochen, you're really bold!"
         He muttered and laughed.
         How bold!
         Did hou Xiaochen call for this?
         This was crazy!
         Hou Xiaochen wasn't the only one who had gone crazy. Li Hao had gone crazy as well. These guys from Silver Moon were all crazy.
         Did he call Li Hao to stellarsky city at this time to prepare for a big fight?
         The death of a former High Duke was not enough. Now that you've come, are you preparing to fight against all the forces in heavenstar?
         "He doesn't seem weak. That diremonster ... Isn't weak either! It's said that he's a descendant of an ancient demon ... But even so, this is not the Silver Moon, nor is it the East!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After mumbling and drinking a cup of tea, Secretary Xiao Ye walked in again.""Minister, should I contact Minister Qin?"
         "No need,"
         "Is Minister Huang here?" the old man asked with a smile.
         "He's out. "
         "Has Dao Jian come out of seclusion?"
         "Not yet,"
         The Secretary was a little puzzled. The old man usually did not care about anything. In the past, Minister Huang Long was the one in charge. Recently, it was Minister Huang and Minister hou who were fighting for power. Why did the old man start to meddle in other people's business?
         Something even more surprising happened. The old man smiled and said,""Tell Minister hou to have a meal with us when he's free. The Department didn't prepare a welcome banquet for him when he came here ... All these years, I've been too lazy to care about these things. Little Huang has also been a little slow ... We should hold a banquet ..."
         Secretary ye was completely dumbfounded, but he quickly replied,""Okay, I'll go find Minister hou later ..."
         "En!"  The old man nodded slightly."Just wait for a while. Also, send me some of the recent transfer reports and personnel transfer files."
         "This ... It's with Minister Huang,"
         "Go get it and let me see."
         The Secretary was shocked beyond words. What ... Did this mean?
         Even though he was filled with doubts, he still nodded his head once more.""Alright, I got it! If Minister Huang doesn't agree ..."
         The old man laughed,"why would I?" Or should I ... Retire?"
         The Secretary didn't dare to say anything else.
         He had been in charge of the night watchman for 20 years, but in recent years, he had been quiet. When he had nothing to do, he would drink tea and read the newspaper. It was as if he was retiring. On the other hand, Huang Long had been making rapid progress. Nowadays, many night watchmen did not even know the name of this Minister.
         What was going on tonight?
         The Secretary left with endless doubts.
         As for the old man, he looked to the other side and sighed with emotion. It was still good to be young!
         What a terrifying young man!
         His strength might not be top-notch, but his courage was definitely top-tier!
         There was even ... A faint murderous intent.
         Who do you want to kill?
         Who do you want to kill?
         Were Silver moon's martial masters getting crazier with each generation?
         After drinking a cup of tea, a faint aura of life overflowed from the tea. If anyone were to see it, their jaws would probably drop in shock. Spring of life!
         The old man let out a comfortable breath.
         Comfortable!
         When one was old, one's five internal organs would feel very uncomfortable. In these few years, it had been completely suppressed and felt comfortable.
         "Please don't torment this old man. He's already at the age of retirement ... That person who promoted him to Governor ... He really has nothing better to do!"
         He shook his head.
         It was a headache. If a Governor came here, how would he arrange it?
         Forget it, I'll leave it to hou Xiaochen.
         Huanglong, Huanglong ... It seems that you may not be able to do anything.
         Chuckling, the old man closed his eyes and stopped thinking about it.
         This Night Watcher's surname was still Yao!
         Whether it's Huang or hou, they're all behind Yao. Little guys, go and cause trouble on your own!
         ……
         Thump thump thump!
          There was a knock on the door.
         Chief Steward Yu was a little confused. Who came?
         It's so late!
         As for hou Xiaochen, he frowned slightly. He wasn't too sure, or rather, he wasn't too sure. He just looked up at the gate with a frown.
         Thump thump thump!
         The knocking sound came again.
         Chief Steward Yu still stood up. This was the headquarters of the night patrolmen, so there was nothing to worry about, but ... It was so late, who would come to see the Minister?
         He walked forward and opened the door.
         The first thing he saw was a tall hat.
         Chief Steward Yu was stunned for a moment.
        
         In the next moment, his expression changed slightly. His body tensed up, and his inner strength was about to surge out. However, he heard a familiar voice.
         "Manager Yu, long time no see!"
         With that, the man spread his arms and hugged chief Yu. He laughed heartily,""I've missed you so much, one day apart feels like three years! I think, chief Yu also misses me very much!"
         Chief Steward Yu's entire body was stiff!
         She didn't say a word and was just shocked.
         Did I ... Hear it wrong?
         Li Hao!
         Was this Li Hao's voice?
         She had just been talking about Li Hao, but in the blink of an eye, she heard Li Hao's voice. This was ... An illusion!
         The next moment, Li Hao sent her away. He stepped forward, took off his hat, and bowed elegantly."General Li Hao pays his respects to the Minister!"
          “……”
         Hou Xiaochen picked up his teacup and took a sip, trying to suppress his anger. It wasn't anger, it was a sense of disbelief and confusion that was beyond his control.
         In that instant, he thought he had returned to Silver Moon.
         Li Hao ... Is here!
         A man who was being hunted by the entire world had come.
         Unscrupulously and arrogantly, he knocked on his door and walked into his office. He said ... He was here!
         Behind him, Yu Luosha also rubbed her stiff face.
         She closed the door and wanted to enter the house ... But the door was pushed open.
         A dog was looking at her innocently.
         Are you blind?
         I haven't even entered yet!
         Chief Steward Yu seemed to have understood what he meant. He was a little stiff. Dog ... Black Panther ... The descendant of the ancient demon?
         But ... How did he become a puppy?
         At this moment, she was no longer cold. She was a little stiff and on the verge of breaking down. She quietly returned to her seat and sat there, looking at Li Hao, Black Panther, and the Minister ... Minister, stop drinking tea. Are you surprised?
         As for Li Hao, he didn't get a reply. He could only stand up and ask doubtfully,""Is this etiquette not standard? Is the head not happy to see me?"
         "Happy ..."
         Hou Xiaochen put down his teacup and stiffly smiled, "I'm quite happy. How did you get here?"
         "I came by car, and by bicycle."
          "Then ... Did you eat tonight?"  "Not yet,"
         "Do you want to eat some?"
         Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded,"alright, you haven't eaten either, have you?" It's my treat, but it's a little expensive here. I asked someone to send me here on a bicycle, but it actually costs 200 yuan ..."
         This was the first time hou Xiaochen had met someone like this, and he was at a loss for words. "It's fine, I'll go to the public account!"
         "Hahaha, Minister, you're so generous!"
         This was generous?
         Hou Xiaochen was helpless. After a long while, he sighed,"You coming ... Is really ... Really ... Makes people ... Happy!"
         Li Hao smiled brightly."Yes, yes, I think so too. I knew the Minister would be happy!" Even though I'm late by a month, I'm still here. Seeing you again, I suddenly feel a sense of security!"
         "Hehe!"
         Hou Xiaochen laughed.
         Chief Steward Yu also laughed helplessly. What kind of F * cking conversation was this!
         The Minister was probably also confused!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com For a moment, in the office, the three people and one dog stared at each other without saying a word.
         Li Hao just waited for hou Xiaochen to wake up so that they could have dinner together.
         There were too many people here, so he could find a place with fewer people and have a meal. Anyway, he could be reimbursed.
         But ... What are you doing sitting there?
         Hou Xiaochen digested the information, thought about it ... After a long time, he smiled.
          He's already here ... Can I still drive him away?
         It's good that she's here!
         He let out a long breath and looked at Li Hao again, his smile no longer stiff. "Let's go and eat. I'm glad that little Li Hao is here! Xiaoyu, order a meal, eat something good, have a sumptuous meal ... And go to the nine Dragons Pavilion!"
         Chief Steward Yu gasped!
         This is crazy!
         What kind of place was the nine Dragons Pavilion?
         That was ... The place where the important figures of the nine divisions would usually go to join in the fun and have fun.
         You took Li Hao there ... Because you think it's not troublesome enough?
         She had a splitting headache!
         At this moment, he suddenly wanted to return to Silver Moon.
        
         Hou Xiaochen said.
         Since he was already here, how could he chase him away?
         Since they were already here, it should be more lively.
         Of course, he still had to do some work. As the governor of heavenstar and the deputy head of the Nightwalker, he still had some power.
         Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly laughed and quickly wrote something on a piece of paper.
         "Li Hao, you've done a great service, and the inspection Bureau has promoted you to the rank of inspector. An inspector patrolls an area and soothes ... You can be considered to have a heavy responsibility now."
         "You've just arrived in the central continent. It'll be more troublesome if you apply for other positions. You'll have to go through a lot of checks ..."
         After thinking for a while, he finished writing on the paper."Now, as the Heavenly Star military governor, I recommend you to be the Heavenly Star Deputy Governor. The Deputy position doesn't need to be inspected by the inspector, it's fine within the night patrollers ... As long as the Minister agrees, you'll be the Heavenly Star Deputy Governor!"
         He quickly finished writing on the paper.
         Li Hao blinked. Deputy Governor Tian Xing?
          What was he doing?
         Of course, this wasn't important. What was important was that he had been promoted. Why didn't I know about it?
         The governor!
         Didn't that mean he was on the same level as hou Xiaochen?
         No...
         Li Hao seemed to have thought of something, and his expression was a little strange.""Minister ... I heard from someone on the road that you ... Seemed to have been demoted to an advanced city Patrol?"
         Hou Xiaochen's body froze. He glanced at Li Hao.
         What do you mean by that?
         Li Hao laughed dryly again under his gaze. "I've been promoted to a provincial governor?"
         "That's right, your rank is higher than mine. What do you want to say?"hou Xiaochen looked at him and laughed.
         Li Hao was embarrassed.
         I don't want to say anything, I just want to say ... You've been in this industry for so many years, but your level is actually lower than mine. What a pitiful person!
         Hou Xiaochen couldn't be bothered to respond.
         A moment later, someone knocked on the office door.
         They all knew that someone had come. Li Hao didn't know who it was, but hou Xiaochen knew who it was. He smiled and looked in a direction. His eyes were sharp, and his ears were sharp.
         As soon as Li Hao arrived, your people arrived.
         "Come in!"
         The door was pushed open, and Xiao Ye walked in. She glanced at Li Hao. She didn't know Li Hao, who was the weirdo she had just seen, so she didn't greet him. However, she was a little afraid of hou Xiaochen. She bowed slightly and said,"Hou bu, the Minister said that when you came, the Ministry did not hold a welcome banquet. He wanted to invite hou bu to a meal these two days ..."
         "Alright!"
         Hou Xiaochen's reply was too straightforward. Although this was what he should do, he didn't even ask anything else. This made little ye feel a little uncomfortable.
         Hou Xiaochen laughed as he handed over a piece of paper,"Take it back and let the Head of Department have a look. Let the Head of Department sign it."
         Xiao Ye was a little puzzled.
         "You'll know when you show it to the Minister,"
         "Yes!"  Xiao Ye didn't dare to ask further. This was a ruthless killer.
         She did not dare to provoke the high Duke's public house. Moreover, the old Minister had been recuperating and did not have much power among the night patrols.
         As for the signature and what to sign, she was not sure.
         She wanted to take a look at this small piece of paper, but she felt a sharp pain in her eyes. She was even more shocked in her heart. Were the words written on this paper lethal?
         How terrifying!
         Xiao Ye didn't stay any longer. Before she left, she glanced at Li Hao and the puppy again. She was still confused. Who would come to see Minister hou so late at night?
         Little ye left in puzzlement.
         After Li Hao's group left, he asked curiously,""This ... Is the Secretary of our Minister?"
         "Yes,"
         "I'm so envious!"
         “……”
         Hou Xiaochen paused. What was there to be envious of?
         Li Hao sighed."It turns out that I can find a female secretary after becoming a minister, and I have to be paid by the government. I'm a provincial governor now. If I find a female secretary, I'll be paid by the government too, right?"
         “……”
         Li Hao, why are you always so ... Different?
         Hou Xiaochen was completely speechless.
         What the hell are you thinking at this time?
         Chief Steward Yu did not look at them at all. He lowered his head and did not know what he was busy with. In his heart, he was ridiculing Li Hao. Li Hao could be said to be as rich as a country. He had seized the Xu family's treasure house, so why did he always want to take advantage of him?
         Although he was joking, Li Hao still said thoughtfully,""The head is an old man with white hair, right?"
         "You've seen it before?"
         "I saw it when I came in."
         Li Hao smiled and said, very powerful!
         "Of course," hou Xiaochen nodded,"when the night patrollers were first established 20 years ago, he was the Head of the Department! The nine divisions and the royal family did not want to waste their energy to deal with the three major organizations. They wanted to find a knife ... And at that time, this person would be that knife! You must know that in that era, even if you were to be used as a saber, you must have the strength and value to be used as a saber! I'm also a blade, but this blade of mine can only be left with Silver Moon. He, on the other hand, is the blade of the entire dynasty!"
          Li Hao nodded."He's not weak. He should be a pure Martial Master!" I just don't know how many of the locks are saturated. "
         "The hou tribe seems to have improved a few things, have they gone a step further?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Why do you say so?" hou Xiaochen chuckled.
         Li Hao smiled without saying anything.
         Because in the past, you were very eye-catching!
         But now, it was no longer eye-catching.
         This meant that the hidden injuries and drawbacks from the conversion back then had been overcome and suppressed. The energy was completely contained. This was definitely an improvement.
         Hou Xiaochen had returned to being a true Martial Master.
         Therefore, there must be some improvement.
         Otherwise, he would be like Chief Steward Yu, who was a little eye-catching. This was the result of the impure path of martial masters. A part of the energy couldn't be contained and was completely absorbed into the body. For Li Hao, this was a big light bulb.
