Obviously, this person instantly understood everything.Once the Panther was killed and the behemoth's corpse was taken away ... Even if they managed to kill the venerable sovereign, the behemoth's corpse would be gone, and Silvermoon would not be able to take it with him. Staying here would only lead to death.Unless Li Hao abandoned Silver Moon and fled on his own!But at this moment, Li Hao had to stop it. He instantly disappeared and reappeared in front of the giant beast. He slashed out with his sword to stop it, but in the next moment, the power of the Crimson Moon appeared in his mind."Put down your weapon ..."The demonic voice that filled his mind made him lose focus. A figure appeared in front of him. The figure had a smile on his face and walked over step by step. His eyes were red and the power of the Crimson Moon appeared.A powerful existence was extremely calm at this moment.Although Li Hao was strong and had a special Dao ... He was only a half-step sovereign, not a venerable sovereign.……Li Hao's firmament sword trembled slightly. At this moment, he couldn't even pull out his sword. He seemed to be helpless in the face of a powerful venerable sovereign.Li Hao's face was flushed!Was he that strong?"Little friend, be good ..."That person's voice rang in Li Hao's ears, carrying a boundless smile. Li Hao's body seemed to be out of his control. At this moment, the voice sounded again."Draw your sword and kill the giant demon ..."Li Hao's arm went out of control. He even began to draw his sword, ready to slash at the behemoth behind him!It was so terrifying!Li Hao's character was definitely not weak, and his strength was also top-notch. At this moment, he actually felt like he was being controlled by someone who wanted him to draw his sword and cut the corpse of the giant beast!His mind was still clear, but at this moment, a red power was slowly invading from the river. The time and star between his brows were struggling.The heaven and earth, which was not too powerful, even felt like it was being forcibly controlled by someone.No matter how many schemes he had, in the face of absolute strength, they seemed to be somewhat useless.At this moment, an extremely sharp cry from someone behind interrupted all this."Lord Marquis, I've come!"A shrill scream that could pierce through the chaos sounded. Qian Wuliang's voice was so sharp and unpleasant, but it was just right at the critical moment.A different power of desire filled the chaos.Qian Wuliang's eyes also glowed red as if desire had consumed him. Li Hao's arms shivered, and his expression changed as he slashed at the venerable sovereign in front of him.BOOM!The venerable sovereign slightly frowned and punched out to destroy the sword intent. With a bit of dissatisfaction, he turned to Qian Wuliang and suddenly laughed,""Interesting. This Dao is interesting! It's in line with my Dao of the red moon ... If I can master this Dao, it'll be perfect for me, the red moon Emperor!"At first, she was a little angry.However, at this moment, he instantly revealed a smile.The great Dao of the Silvermoon world might have been affected by the corrosion. When it was born, it actually gave birth to such a strong Dao of desire!He instantly deduced some things. Previously, the power of the great path was filled with the will of ten thousand DAOs returning to one, which should have been affected by the sword Saint. Now, the strong power of desire was probably affected by the bone erosion.When a great Dao was first created, it was natural to use the Silvermoon's strongest power.The unification of all DAOs was represented by venerable sword.Endless desire was represented by the red moon eroding bones.As for time ... Perhaps, just as Li Hao had guessed, the Silver Moon itself was born because of Zhan Tiandi's power. Therefore, the Silver Moon's great path universe included several orthodoxies!Li Hao's sword attack was broken in an instant.At this moment, it was equivalent to two first stage venerable sovereigns fighting one third stage venerable sovereign. Even if they were no match for him, they still had a chance.However ... The seventh Thunderbolt had already appeared!The desire in Qian Wuliang's eyes was greatly reduced.He felt somewhat helpless!Without the lightning tribulation, he and Li Hao could have held out for a while. If the Black Panther had taken control of the behemoth's corpse and devoured the Silver Moon, they would not be too afraid even if they could not defeat the Black Panther.But ... The chaos lightning tribulation was still there!Li Hao had almost no chance to attack. He could only block the lightning. Li Hao's plan was to wait for an opportunity, not for the Heaven's Fate members to appear now ... But where was the opportunity?He could not see an opportunity!He couldn't see the opportunity!Li Hao said that neo martial might create an opportunity ... But where?Red Moon sovereign did not seem to be in a hurry. Instead of continuing to attack, he retreated a distance and smiled. He looked up at the sky. The Thunder tribulation was coming!As long as Thunder came, he would not have to worry about Li Hao. He would just have to kill this fellow who also controlled desire and silver moon's will!Li Hao, on the other hand, also looked up at the sky with a grave expression.He still had other means!Second cat!Second cat could help him block the Thunderbolts, but he wasn't sure how many times he could block them. The key was that he still lacked opportunities. What he needed was the opportunities that neo martial could create for him ...In the past, the neo martial human King and the neo martial Supreme had said that they would create an opportunity for him at that moment.But ... Li Hao didn't see it. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  Where was the opportunity?Only when neo martial did something big that affected the entire chaos and the sudden appearance of celestial pole, Zhang an, and the others could intimidate this powerful venerable sovereign and create some opportunities for Li Hao and the others to kill the enemy!Otherwise ... With the lightning tribulation still around and Silvermoon's trump cards revealed, there was no hope of dealing with this powerful venerable sovereign!At this moment, Li Hao sighed.

Could neo martial ... Really create an opportunity for him?I don't know!"But I have no other way out. This is the only way I can win.​ His strength was still improving, but there was a limit to it. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was not a shortcut to improving one's strength. Even if one had some insights, they would only slowly gain them after the battle.The chances of a sudden breakthrough ... Were too low.……At the same time.Somewhere far away from Silver Moon.In the great dark world.The long saber descended and slashed through the chaos. An extremely ancient existence appeared instantly and punched out. Darkness attacked and the chaos dissipated, leaving only boundless darkness that enveloped the long saber.The Dark World had existed before the yin-yang world.Darkness engulfed the chaos.At this moment, the neo martial human King was directly covered. At the same time, behind the neo martial human King, an extremely powerful existence suddenly appeared. It was not just one, but many strong Masters, and they attacked at the same time!I'll take your life while you're down!The neo martial king who rampaged through the chaos should disappear today!The master of ultimate darkness had appeared ... Someone had blocked the human King's Blade, and the danger of the human King had been reduced infinitely.Many powerhouses attacked at the same time!A pincer attack!At this moment, many experts peeked over from a distance and stared at this side. As for the other side, the weak fluctuations from the battle between some insignificant venerable sovereigns ... No top-notch existences paid attention to it.The neo martial human King was the real threat.Moreover, the Second World Lord of the yin-yang world was also conquering the blissful world in a further area. This time, he had swept away many high-level venerable sovereigns!The darkness devoured heaven and earth, and behind it, all kinds of great DAOs appeared. There was even a great Dao universe vaguely appearing ... This also meant that the person behind the sneak attack was very likely the master of a great Dao of a large world!There was more than one top-notch existence!At this moment, the human king who had been swallowed by the darkness was faintly discernible, as if he was about to be taken away by the darkness. That human King was no longer crazy, no longer arrogant, no longer arrogant ...His eyes were filled with fear.All of a sudden, when the surroundings were quiet, the neo martial human King suddenly shouted,""Impossible!"“……”What was impossible?The experts who made a move were all shocked. What was impossible?Did you not expect that we would launch a sneak attack?You're underestimating our guts!Or could it be that he felt that he had fallen into a trap so easily, so ... He couldn't believe it?That's because you were too stupid! What's impossible?!Just as the various DAOs landed on the human King's body, fear appeared in his eyes once more. He turned to look at the people who were attacking him from behind and his eyes were filled with endless fear."Impossible ... How could the chaos collapse ..."The few powerhouses who attacked were shocked!What?The Collapse of Chaos?How was that possible?The few experts were shocked. The human King's eyes were filled with fear, boundless fear. At this moment, even the few Supreme experts could feel his fear, his panic, his helplessness ...Why didn't he feel anything unusual?In their fear, they couldn't help but be distracted for a moment. They used their mental energy to check behind them. Chaos collapsing ... What did that mean?On the other side, the Master of Darkness, who had just punched out, was facing them. He looked behind them and frowned slightly. Instantly, his mind power swept in all directions. "Don't ..."  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Don't be distracted!Idiot!He had already cultivated to this stage, so even if something really happened, he should not be distracted. The neo martial King in front of him was extraordinary.However, he was a little too late!The neo martial human King did not Dodge and took the punch from the Master of Darkness head-on. He spat out blood and his eyes were still filled with infinite fear. It was as if he was saying that he was going to die anyway, so it was nothing to be hit by a punch.At this moment, the experts were once again distracted.The blood that was spat out instantly turned into a blood mist that filled the sky. At this moment, the fear in the neo martial King's eyes disappeared. A long blade suddenly appeared and slashed down!This blade directly tore apart the chaos. A great Dao universe was instantly revealed by the long blade. The long blade cut through the universe, and countless orthodoxies in the great Dao universe instantly collapsed!The human King curled his lips. What a bunch of idiots.With one fresh move, he could eat all over the world.When I lie, I never fail.The blade fell!A part of the great path universe collapsed. One of the attackers 'body collapsed instantly. The long saber flashed and the figure collapsed. The long saber slashed across the world again!Behind him, the fist of darkness attacked again!However, this neo martial King still did not Dodge. His golden body appeared and illuminated the sky. Chaos was instantly illuminated and darkness was broken. A punch once again hit the neo martial King!After two consecutive punches, the neo martial human King did not care about this. He let the darkness erode him and tore the chaos apart with his long blade!BOOM!A deafening boom shook the entire chaos. The saber slashed across, severing the great DAOs, worlds, and vitality of the few experts who had come to attack from behind!Bang! Bang!The sound of an explosion reverberated through the chaos.Like a broken bag, the human King fell heavily into the depths of the chaos. He vomited blood non-stop, but he instantly revealed an evil smile. In the blink of an eye, he entered the depths of the chaos, and his screams were endless!Even the weakest among the group of Rangers was a third stage venerable sovereign. He instantly emerged from the depths of the chaos and killed several venerable sovereigns in the blink of an eye!

Chapter 2562 Resplendent Fireworks (1)
The expression of the Master of Darkness changed!The few people who had just attacked ... Had all turned into dust. The power of all kinds of special great DAOs spread in all directions. Even a broken great Dao universe was collapsing!He was dead!Damn it!This group of trash, among them, there was even a sixth-tier master of the great Dao, and he was actually killed just like that!Stupid!That was too stupid!That human King had only used one expression and one look ... And these peerless existences had actually been swayed. They had actually dared to divert their attention when they were ambushing him!It was simply ... Indescribable!The great Dao universe collapsed, and the chaos Rangers who were chasing after the human King screamed. Even though they had cultivated to this level, they were still frightened at this moment! How could this be?Also, the Master of Darkness couldn't hurt the human King with two punches.In almost an instant, the experts who had been chasing after the human King were all killed along with the death of the master of the great Dao!  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 The master of the great Dao was also the core of these Rangers.Once he was dead, the other venerable sovereigns would not have the strength to fight the human King.At that moment, blood dripped from the human King's long saber. He turned to look at the Master of Darkness, who was about to give him a third punch, and grinned."Today, Zhan Yueming master, you've raised the might of my new martial arts and congratulated me!"Yueming, your ancestor!The Master of Darkness didn't say a word and just threw a punch."Don't be so arrogant. Although those people died, you didn't have it easy with my two consecutive punches. Why are you so arrogant? in a battle between experts, even a slight difference could turn the tide!"But at this moment, a maniacal smile suddenly appeared on the human King's face."Big cat, hang in there!"He didn't seem to be talking to the Master of Darkness, but to the old cat in the distance.In just an instant ... Suddenly, a great Dao universe appeared in the chaos above the human King. The power of Yin and yang instantly appeared on the human King's body.At the same time, Emperor Cang, who was fighting against the Elysian world, suddenly lost all his strength.The expressions of the Supreme-being experts beside him changed. In the next moment, he cursed in a low voice,"“艹!”That damned guy!It's been so many years, why haven't you changed your personality? you're really not afraid of me dying!Are you afraid that I won't die?The yin-yang world was shared by the two masters. There were good and bad things. The good thing was that it didn't matter if one died ... The bad thing was that there was a bastard who liked to extract all the energy of the other master. Most importantly, he could even extract it.The main thing was that the stupid cat was really stupid. No matter how dangerous it was ... It would still let people whip it and would not refuse.For example, right now, the Lord of bliss was surrounded by them and was about to gain the upper hand. Suddenly, the top-tier Emperor Cang lost all his power ... This was a F * cking joke!However, Emperor Cang ... Still did not say anything and allowed the other party to draw away all his strength.It was like seeing a ghost!A book of the great Dao appeared in an instant. Thousands of Dao appeared and enveloped Emperor Cang. In the middle, the Lord of bliss's eyes lit up with joy. Originally, he felt very uncomfortable when the top existences like the sun god surrounded and killed him. However, the most powerful Emperor Cang ... Had suddenly lost all his energy!A chance!He would take this opportunity to kill them!In an instant, boundless power appeared, and the universe of the great path appeared, suppressing the world. The book of Dao trembled violently.At the same time.On the other side, the strength of the neo martial human King suddenly increased dramatically. The Master of Darkness punched out, and his expression suddenly changed. He knew the characteristics of the yin-yang world, but everyone was a top-notch existence.Everyone knew that at this moment, neo martial had launched an attack on two major worlds at the same time.Therefore, he didn't consider the possibility that the neo martial human King would transfer the opponent's power ... Unless the neo Martial Emperor Cang was an idiot, if his power was taken away now, the blissful world would rebound and the yin-yang world might be destroyed.He didn't think that this neo martial human King would be crazy to this extent.At this moment, you dare to draw away the power of Emperor Cang?Are you crazy?In this way, when the other side is destroyed, the yin-yang world will be destroyed, and you will be severely injured. It is a matter that will damage both sides, not one side."Old Zhang, sun god and the others can hold on ... Enough for me to kill you!"The neo martial human King grinned without much fear.What was there to be afraid of?"As long as those people are here, I'm never afraid. The rear is stable and will not collapse. If it really collapses ... Then we'll all be finished. What's the big deal?"In this world, you have to be ruthless, more ruthless than others, so that you can stand firm!If I, the new martial arts experts, am not ruthless, how can I stand firm in this man-eat-man chaos? In this battle, I'll make the four major worlds view me as a demon!This was the Dao of a Demon King!At this moment, the drawn power instantly merged and became one with yin and yang. An extremely powerful force emerged from the saber. The long saber slashed out and chaos exploded!In the distance, some major cosmos absolute beings 'expressions changed.Dark master's expression changed drastically."You lunatic!"This was crazy!He regretted it. If he had known this would happen, he would not have provoked this person.He was a top venerable sovereign. Under normal circumstances, even if he didn't provoke this guy, this guy might not come to provoke him. He knew that this man was reckless and wanted to kill Red Moon master, so why should he interfere?But at this moment, he didn't have the time to think about it.With a slash of the saber, the fist broke!The fist of darkness was instantly shattered.The master of ultimate darkness was shocked and wanted to escape into the world. He had to rely on the geographical advantage to resist this person. As long as he could hold him back for a moment, the master of bliss would kill Emperor Cang and the others. The yin-yang world would be destroyed, and this new martial human King would die without a doubt!

Just for a while!I can do it!They were both seventh rank venerable sovereigns, but the other party was currently in the state of Yin Yang integration and still could not break through the seventh rank. He could definitely do it!Block him!He retreated back into the world and stopped him ...In the distance, the Lord of bliss seemed to know the situation. A heaven-like universe of the great path appeared in the world and suppressed the neo martial experts.However, at this moment, a blade, a sword, a book, a punch ...One by one, the powerful existences burst out fearlessly. There were even many venerable sovereigns who self-destructed, and the power of the explosion swept across the world!"The new martial arts are invincible, the human King is unparalleled. We'll wait for you to reverse yin and yang!"The venerable sovereigns were so crazy that they didn't even look like they were the ones who took the initiative to attack. Instead, they looked like they were the ones being attacked.He had self-destructed so naturally!He was so confident that new martial arts would win, that the human King would win, that he would kill the enemy, reverse yin and yang, and resurrect them!That level of trust was far beyond the imagination of the primal Chaos experts.All the Supreme emperors of the blissful great world were killed, and boundless energy swept in all directions.At this moment, a loud shout reverberated through the chaos in the distance.As the blade fell, yin and yang appeared, like the eight trigrams."Let's kill the strongest for fun ..."The devil-like laughter shook the world.The Master of Darkness's expression changed drastically. The great path universe above his head was split open by a blade.There was still a chance!The Master of Darkness's expression changed. There was still a chance, there was still time. He just had to wait a little longer for the master of bliss to kill Emperor Cang ... The other party should understand that he had to kill Emperor Cang now. Otherwise, everyone would be finished!Just as he laid down layers of defense, although the great Dao universe had been cut open, it was not so easy to destroy. He was not the master of the great Dao from before. The power of the world instantly emerged and turned into a defense!It was blocked for an instant!With this thought in mind, he instantly set up an endless defensive array.However, at this moment, the crazy human King suddenly grinned."So stupid!"Stupid?The Master of Darkness was shocked. At that moment, all the power in the human King's body disappeared, and he became a mortal. He laughed. "I'll kill Ji le first, then I'll kill you! Why did you trap yourself in your turtle shell? I don't have any strength right now, you can kill me with a single breath ..."The Master of Darkness's expression changed drastically!In an instant, the human King hurriedly broke through his defense. He then laughed,""If you break it and regain your strength, I'll definitely kill you!"The Master of Darkness hesitated.Right!However, during this moment of hesitation, Emperor Cang's aura suddenly increased. The originally powerless Emperor Cang's strength had increased to an extreme in an instant.The Lord of bliss was about to kill the cat!Suddenly, his face changed and he roared,""Bastard!"Who was he scolding?Perhaps it was the master of ultimate darkness!Stupid fellow!However, it was too late."Meow ... What a big fish!"At this moment, a boundless devouring force instantly devoured the sky. In the blink of an eye, the universe of the great Dao of bliss above the chaos was instantly swallowed into the cat's stomach. The Lord of bliss's expression changed instantly!Suddenly, a punch came from the side.The fist of the sun god!Following that, countless killing moves were unleashed.The huge cat reached out its claws and pierced through the Lord of bliss like a balloon!The Lord of bliss's face was deathly pale. In an instant, countless experts behind him were covered by the cat's claws and turned into small fish.At this moment, the power of the huge cat dissipated again.In the distance, the human King grinned.At this moment, the voice was even more powerful than before. The face of the man king, who was still hesitating whether to break through the defense, changed again! BOOM!The long saber broke it!The world collapsed, and the great Dao collapsed. The human King no longer had any scruples as he madly slashed out!One strike, two strikes, three strikes ...He could block it for a while, but it was impossible to block it for a long time. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He slashed hundreds of times in succession ... With a loud bang, the great path universe collapsed, and The Dark World collapsed. Darkness master's face was pale, and the human King bared his teeth and smiled."Killing you ... That's big enough, right?"BOOM!A saber slashed out!As if the chaos was collapsing, the entire chaos was trembling violently. The human King's body suddenly expanded, and his long blade cut across the universe. He held a broken universe of the great path in his hand, as if he knew that the commotion was not big enough.He didn't devour the great Dao universe. Instead, he laughed."Light some fireworks for fun. This King likes to watch!"The broken universe suddenly exploded violently at this moment!BOOM!The loud noise even shook the entire chaos. In the dark chaos, a bright firework lit up the surroundings!Wasn't killing experts big enough?Then what if I ... Blow up a great Dao universe!As for the benefits of devouring it ... What was the big deal?Silver Moon reappears in chaos. Silver Moon, in any case, is under this daddy's protection, but it seems like his own plaque has been attacked, and he's not giving him any face at all ... So what if it explodes? I wonder if that little fellow who can swim over has any ability?Could he seize this opportunity to finish off his opponent?Besides, wasn't there still an Elysian universe this time?The fireworks were brilliant!In that instant, the four major worlds were all stunned. The human King's voice reverberated through the chaos."Fang ping of the new martial arts, the master of the Dark Moon, is here!"In the distance, Dark Moon master's face was pale.You've got the wrong person!At this moment, he was certain that this human King had mistaken him for someone else. He had already killed his opponent, so there was no need to humiliate him any further. His opponent was even stronger than him, and given the crazed personality of this human King, there was no need for him to mention the name of a weakling after killing someone stronger.Suddenly, he felt extremely lucky.Rejoicing, he swept up the great world and moved with great difficulty in the direction of the Crimson Moon world!This was big trouble!This new martial madman ... Was too terrifying!On this day, two great worlds were shattered!At this moment, countless world Lords were shaking, trembling, shocked, and terrified.……At this moment, the huge firework suddenly appeared in the dark chaos at the cost of igniting a great path universe.When experts fought, no matter how big the commotion was, it actually didn't reach Li Hao and the others.However, at that moment, the boundless light even illuminated the Silver Moon!A powerful great path universe was ignited and exploded by a madman!Li Hao smiled.Red Moon sovereign, who was kneading Qian Wuliang, suddenly turned around with a look of horror in her eyes.It was unbelievable! He could even vaguely hear the sound of the explosion of the great Dao universe. New martial, Dark Moon Destroyer master!How could this be?The fireworks were dazzling, but he was so shocked that his face turned pale. The nethermoon world was not too far from the Crimson Moon. This ... The Crimson Moon world was going to encounter the neo martial?However, the position of the fireworks was a little different.It seemed ... To be even further away than the Dark Moon world!How could that be the Dark Moon world?With some shock, some fear, and some panic, he was a little dazed.In fact, such a mistake should not have happened to a venerable sovereign. However, no one could remain calm at this moment. A macro world had been destroyed. The key was that the other party had directly exploded the universe and did not seize it. How crazy and arrogant was he!

2564 Chapter 427
The fireworks were brilliant!It bloomed instantly. The universe of the great path exploded, and it was rare to see it in ancient times.Even when two worlds collided, under normal circumstances, the main focus would be to devour and devour. They would choose to ignite the great Dao universe, and they could even ignite and explode ... This situation was extremely rare!At this moment, even the powerful red Moon sovereign was a little dazed.Of course, he wasn't afraid of Li Hao's group.A group of people weaker than him didn't have much to fear.Moreover, Li Hao was still resisting the lightning tribulation. The seventh lightning tribulation had almost taken Li Hao's life.At this moment, the Thunder tribulation was still going on, and the eighth Thunder tribulation was about to descend.At that moment, a cat flew out of the river.It was a little reluctant ... But it was still a little cat. It was relatively easy to talk to. It mumbled something, and it wasn't sure if it was cursing. Then it flew out and headed for the Thunder.It opened its cat mouth and swallowed the lightning!The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was extremely powerful.However, be it Emperor Cang or second cat, they both had the ability to contain and devour everything in the world.Even the primal Chaos lightning tribulation was no exception.As soon as it opened its mouth, the eighth lightning tribulation disappeared. The chaos lightning tribulation was so powerful that it could hurt or even kill venerable sovereigns ... Weak venerable sovereigns.However, it was still devoured the moment it opened its mouth.The ninth Thunder tribulation seemed to have been provoked. It appeared instantly and caused a huge commotion. Normally, people would have noticed it and even the Lord of the Crimson Moon world would have paid attention to it.But at this moment ... Who had the time to care about this?Whether it was dealing with Silver Moon or snatching Silver Moon, it was all to deal with neo martial.And now, neo martial had appeared.Not only did he appear, but he also annihilated two lords of a major world and the Lord of the great Dao of a major world in one day. Even if that person was not a world Lord, he had the power of a sixth stage venerable Emperor, which meant that he was at least a top-notch existence in a major world.A large number of venerable sovereigns had fallen. Such a shock was far from comparable to what was happening here.In the distant Crimson Moon world, no one cared about this side. All the strong people were focused in one direction, in the direction of the brilliant fireworks. For the first time, the Crimson Moon world felt pressure!Even though Red Moon master was a true top-notch venerable sovereign, she still looked solemn at this moment. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Neo martial human King and neo Martial Emperor Cang were both extremely powerful.If Red Moon wanted to Annex neo martial ... It would probably be an extremely difficult war.……Li Hao also smiled.The neo martial artist was indeed worthy of his reputation!It was not only powerful, but also the kind of selflessness. They had really done it, and it was only because of a memory trip. Although destroying the great world was a form of self-strengthening for neo martial, it was also to reduce the enemy's actions.However, the source was still that trip in the past.He was really a trustworthy person!Neo martial human King, neo martial Supreme. If he gave so much face, he would seem a little incompetent. The red moon sovereign in front of him was very powerful!However...My side isn't weak either.Li Hao had barely reached the venerable Emperor level, the two masters of Dao as one had also reached the venerable Emperor level, and the two cats fighting Thunder had also reached the venerable Emperor level ...Silver Moon did not seem to have a venerable sovereign, but in fact, his strength was not weaker than an ordinary small world. He was only so-so for some of the middle-level worlds that had just advanced.Two cats appeared, but Li Hao didn't make a move.At this moment, a book of the great Dao appeared in the distance.Red Moon sovereign was still in shock. At this moment, he was stunned again and infinite fear emerged in his heart.This is ... The book of the great Dao of neo martial arts?The book of supremacy?How was that possible?Why was he here?At the same time, figures appeared one after another. One of them tore through the void and came over. The sound of the celestial pole was like a great Bell as he shouted from a distance,""I'm here on the orders of the human King to bring the Silver Moon back. Who dares to attack the Silver Moon? Kneel down! I'll spare your life!""Kneel down!"Countless figures shouted loudly, as if they were going to destroy the world!In front of him, there was a new martial art that cut the world. In an instant, the book of the great Dao appeared, carrying the strong cultivators who broke through the air. Even if the aura was a little chaotic, the power of the new martial art was still deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.Red Moon sovereign, who was already in a state of shock, was terrified at this moment.The new martial arts were here!Neo martial had really come.Although Red Moon was strong, the one who was strong was red moon's master, the top venerable sovereign of Red Moon. Although he had entered the third stage, he had barely entered it. Facing these crazy venerable sovereigns of new martial arts ... Perhaps any one of them had the power to kill him.You won't die if you kneel!This was the arrogance of neo martial. Wherever it went, it was like plowing through a courtyard and sweeping through acupoints. Those who were unconvinced and those who did not surrender were all killed!His legs were even trembling.Kneel down?At this moment, such a thought suddenly appeared in his mind.Panic, fear!It's impossible for me alone to fight against all the strong neo martial artists. It's hard for me to escape.Qian Wuliang, who was terrified and tortured by him, seized the opportunity at this moment. A red light flashed in his eyes, and a sense of fear spread in all directions.Endless fear and uneasiness!I control emotions, I control people's hearts ... The Crimson Moon is also the Dao of desire, and desire comes with fear.The greater the desire, the greater the fear.He spread out his will of the way and took advantage of this moment when the other party was a little distracted to start influencing this powerful venerable sovereign in reverse.As for Li Hao, at this moment, he drew his sword and was about to slash ...But the next moment, Li Hao sighed in his heart. Sure enough, even the heavens wanted to go against him ... Or rather, those who made a living would have to pay for it sooner or later!

2565 Chapter 427
He had used the power of time and the power of the future again and again. Last time, in order to deal with the Thunder tribulation and Shi Gu, he had used the power of the future self again. Now, the peak of his fighting spirit had come again.The power in his body suddenly disappeared into thin air. The powerful energy flowed to an unknown place. It was probably the previous time.Go over and borrow power!If he didn't lend it, he might have died last time. The chaos lightning tribulation was only a punishment, but he still had to pay the energy he needed.There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world.Li Hao had anticipated this, but it came too quickly. He had thought that it would appear in the subsequent lightning tribulations, but it happened now.In the distance, Lin Hongyu's figure moved.Li Hao had mentioned this a long time ago, and she had been paying attention to him the whole time. She didn't dare to look away from Li Hao for even a second. When she sensed that Li Hao's aura had disappeared, she knew that he had lost his energy again, just like last time.At this moment, within the river, a half-black and half-white Star appeared instantly, replacing the time star and taking control of the river once more. The waves of the river surged and energy converged, converging on the black and white star.Just as Lin Hongyu was about to replace Li Hao and attack the trembling Supreme Emperor ...Li Hao suddenly took a deep breath. This time, he had only lost his power, not died.He suddenly stopped Lin Hongyu with his will. The river of time surged again. Time reversed. In an instant, the black and white stars disappeared, and the energy gathered on Li Hao again!Lin Hongyu's expression changed!What was he doing?According to their agreement, he should be taking Li Hao's place at this moment. Why did he turn back time? if he did so, the lightning tribulation would get stronger and cause him trouble for no reason.Did he not trust her?Or did he think that he couldn't kill that powerful venerable sovereign?All of this happened and was completed in an instant.Li Hao didn't really care whether Thunder was stronger or not ... He just wanted to respond to the neo martial artists. Since they kept their word, Li Hao should show them that the master of Silvermoon wasn't an incompetent person!As for the price that would be higher later on ... So what?He was acting on impulse ... But he did not really believe that Lin Hongyu had the power to kill a venerable sovereign by gathering energy. It was very likely that she would fail.In that case, I'll do it myself!In the river, there was also a force of Thunder that gathered. In an instant, the firmament sword appeared.On the other side, venerable sovereign Red Moon shuddered. However, gradually, he felt that something was wrong. He looked at the book of Dao and realized that it seemed to be much weaker than he had imagined.Behind him, a sword intent also faintly appeared!He seemed to have realized something.However, the previous loss of spirit and fear made him unable to respond in time. It was just that ... It was not that easy for these people to deal with him!At this moment, an extremely powerful Crimson Moon Power appeared on his body.Li Hao's sword was already slashing toward him!The sword intent and the power of the red moon collided. Even if the power of the red moon only exploded for an instant, it was still extremely powerful. Red Moon sovereign roared and the powerful pressure suppressed the heaven and earth!You want to take the opportunity to kill me? How was that possible?Li Hao already had the power of a first stage venerable sovereign, so what?This person couldn't compare to him stepping into grade three.The sword will soared into the sky and contained the power of lightning. If the giant beast from before was still alive, he might not be able to take it if he reacted in a daze. However, he was stronger than the giant beast!BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the heavens and the earth. The power of the red moon dissipated and a sword mark appeared between the eyebrows of the red moon Thearch. A crack appeared and golden blood flowed out.The venerable sovereign, however, turned to look at Li Hao coldly.He no longer cared about the celestial pole!Fake!He had just been intimidated by neo martial arts. At this moment, he finally reacted. It was just a fake. These people were just threatening him, and he ... Was indeed frightened!Unfortunately, he was not strong enough. Otherwise, he would really be in danger of dying."Not bad!"A cold voice came out of his mouth.It was indeed not bad.The sword had hurt him, and the destructive sword intent was even destroying his vitality. Don't forget that I am a venerable sovereign!The aura on his body instantly became stronger."Just this?",m The power of the red moon emerged on his fist. In an instant, the whole world was filled with the power of the red moon, and it even began to spread to the entire Silver Moon. On the other side, Qian Wuliang was spitting out blood crazily. Red light flickered in his eyes, and he seemed to be seriously injured by the backlash.Li Hao's sword attack had only injured his opponent, not even seriously injuring him.It could be seen that this person was 30% stronger than the giant beast.In the back, Tian Ji had a helpless expression.He had no choice! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Although he had disguised himself well ... A fake was a fake. It was too difficult to hide from a venerable sovereign for a long time.Zhang an, who had forcefully presented the powerful book of Dao, also turned pale.Did he still fail?With ermao out, new martial arts had done what they should do. Heibao was still controlling the giant beast. Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang suffered from the backlash, so he and Heaven's Fate couldn't keep intimidating the other party. Ermao was still resisting the Thunder tribulation. The others ... Didn't have any ability to stop a powerful venerable sovereign.It's finished!Li Hao's plan was good, but it still didn't seem to be enough.His opponent was not a weak venerable sovereign.At this moment, Li Hao was the only one who remained calm.

The river of time behind him changed at this moment. It was like a bridge that suddenly landed on the world of the Silver Moon!The two ends of the river were connected to the void Dao universe and the truth Dao universe.The time star was suspended in the middle of the river of time.Li Hao, in a unique way, had once again combined the three DAOs into one.Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang appeared in an instant, and the two universes separated. Their rivers of Dao started to circle the Silver Moon, and all the power was absorbed by the river of time.Li Hao, however, closed his eyes.Red Moon sovereign sneered. He was not weak!However, it was still not enough.At this moment, he no longer said anything and no longer delayed. There was still some fear in the depths of his heart. He was worried that the neo martial would really come to kill him. Therefore, at this moment, he no longer hesitated. He punched out and the red moon descended!Kill this person!At this moment, Li Hao stopped drawing his sword. With countless DAOs intertwining in his eyes, he took a light breath.I can't become stronger!"But I ... Might have a way to make you weaker.Since I can't make myself stronger, I'll make the enemy weaker.As he pointed out his finger, a long river appeared in an instant. Time and Stars revolved around it. The world seemed to have reversed. Red Moon Emperor's heart trembled slightly. At this moment, he seemed to feel that time had reversed!His aura suddenly weakened.On the other side, Li Hao trembled violently. At this moment, his eyes were filled with the Enlightenment he had gained when the Stargate was opened and the change in the flow of time!At this moment, Red Moon sovereign suddenly realized that he seemed to have become younger, while Li Hao seemed to have aged a lot. He was rapidly aging, and he felt his vitality returning.Li Hao's vitality seemed to have poured into his body.There was such a good thing?He was shocked, but the next moment, he gradually realized that something was wrong. His power ... Was fading.Originally, he had just advanced to rank three venerable sovereign not long ago.At this moment ... Suddenly, as if he had reached a node, his aura suddenly dropped by a section, and in an instant, it was comparable to the aura of the giant beast.Second rank!Had he fallen in rank?It was unbelievable!"Time reversal!"He mumbled to himself as he tried to break free from the winding river. However, at this moment, he realized that he could no longer resist the power of the winding river!He was even younger!There was more vitality!However, his strength had actually declined. At this moment, Li Hao coughed continuously and smiled. He looked at the venerable sovereign opposite him. He had succeeded.p It would be very difficult!However, the person in front of him had probably advanced not long ago and was able to turn back time.The combination of the power of three DAOs was still able to complete this reversal. So the power of time could be used in this way.Although he had actually used it before to speed up, such as er Mao and Zheng Yu, he had used it once to speed up er Mao's speed of devouring the eight meridians. However, that time, it was just downstream. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This time, it was a reversal!It was completely different!Flowing downstream was just a catalyst.Reversal was a different domain, and the difficulty was more than one level higher.He didn't dare to use the flow of the river on the man in front of him. The man was a venerable sovereign with an infinite lifespan. If he went with the flow, he would die before the man grew old."Although I'm far from neo martial ... I can't let people underestimate me!"Li Hao was in high spirits. It was difficult for him to achieve the feat of a neo martial artist, but ... There was still hope of killing a Red Moon sovereign.By gathering the power of silver Moon and borrowing the power of neo martial, even if it wasn't his own strength, he had to get a good start.At this moment, the river was like a sword.The sword fell!This sword was also extremely powerful. On the other side, even if Red Moon sovereign had dropped a rank, he was still a second rank venerable sovereign. He was still extremely powerful. At this moment, he was also extremely angry and punched out!He had actually dropped in rank!One had to know that every advancement in the venerable sovereign realm was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!He had existed since the appearance of the Crimson Moon world. He had cultivated to this day and conquered countless worlds to reach this stage. But Li Hao's one move had wasted countless opportunities!Damn it!In the collision of the sword and the fist, Li Hao, who had combined the three DAOs into one, was still a bit weaker.BOOM!Li Hao's body collapsed, and the three Rivers behind him shook.The entire Silvermoon world was shaking."After I kill you, this power of time will dissipate and I will recover!"Red Moon sovereign shouted coldly. No one knew if he was trying to comfort himself or if he really thought so.Li Hao, whose body was collapsing, smiled.A huge beast appeared behind Red Moon sovereign without anyone noticing.The two sides had been fighting for so long, and the Black Panther had finally succeeded in taking over the giant bull's body.As for the Black Panther ... It had always been the best at attacking, which was to sneak behind the enemy and deliver a fatal blow. It had cooperated with Li Hao many times, so it didn't even need Li Hao to remind it.It was its first time using the body of the giant bull, so it was not very familiar with it. It had forgotten to use its sharp horns, and its hooves were not as sharp as the dog's claws.However, it didn't matter.The bull's hooves were like fists. Red Moon sovereign, who had just exchanged a blow with Li Hao, suddenly turned around and punched. With a loud boom, the chaotic aura in the surroundings exploded!This was the first time the Black Panther had taken control of a giant beast's physical body. It was not very familiar with it, but its strength was still there.The bull's hooves exploded and red Moon sovereign's fist was shattered.Red Moon sovereign was in a sorry state, Li Hao's body was still crumbling, and the Black Panther's bull body was cracking ...

2567 Chapter 427
The strength of a powerful venerable sovereign was beyond imagination.The fact that his opponent was still alive after such an attack infuriated him. His arms appeared again and clenched into fists. Suddenly, he punched out at the same time, one at Li Hao and the other at Black Panther!Bastard!Did these guys really think that a third stage venerable sovereign would die so easily?How could it be so easy to fight against a venerable sovereign?Even though the Silvermoon heaven's will has the physical body of a second rank Chaos Beast, do you know how to use the power of a venerable sovereign?He still had a chance to kill all of them.On the other side, the cat was resisting the lightning, but as Li Hao continued to use the power of time, the lightning was getting stronger and stronger. The cat wouldn't be able to hold on for much longer, and it would be time for him to kill them.At this moment, Li Hao was helpless.It was really hard to kill!Reversing time, reducing the opponent's strength, three DAOs as one, gathering the full power of the Silver Moon, seizing the body of the Heaven's Will, seizing the body of the giant beast, the deterrence of the new martial arts, an explosive surprise attack ...Despite all these methods, the other party was still alive.Was this the true venerable sovereign?From the looks of it, his sword intent was far inferior to the longevity sword intent. The giant beast had been killed in two strikes."So embarrassing!"Li Hao mumbled. How embarrassing.The commotion created by the new martial human King and the others even suppressed the chaos. On his side, he could not even kill a venerable sovereign in the Crimson Moon world!The Silver Moon Martial Master loved his face the most.This time, he seemed to have lost face.Could he still kill his opponent?Do you still have other tricks up your sleeve?Of course, there was still a little!At this moment, Li Hao's body turned illusionary and he shouted,""Black Panther!"In the distance, the Black Panther was about to launch another attack when the giant eye suddenly looked at Li Hao. Li Hao also looked at the Black Panther. The two of them exchanged a glance. The Black Panther seemed to understand, although it wasn't too sure ...However, at this moment, the Black Panther did not say anything. It suddenly opened its huge mouth!In an instant, the huge mouth swallowed Hundun!Not only red Moon Emperor, but even the Silver Moon world seemed to be shrouded in it!Red Moon sovereign snorted. Devour?So what?Swallow me and break out of your stomach. You'll die faster, you don't know what death is!The powerful devouring power even wrapped around the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, swallowing everyone and everything into a huge mouth!Red Moon Emperor was still fearless!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly turned around and headed straight for the Silvermoon world!He didn't do anything else. With a sudden roar, a huge force appeared and a door was pulled up from the ground above the barrier of the Silvermoon world! Stargate!With a roar, Li Hao pulled up the Stargate with great power!The next moment, he held the Stargate in his hand and flew up, flying straight in the direction of the mouth of the Black Panther.Under Red Moon sovereign's hesitant gaze, Li Hao instantly erected the huge gate to the mouth and the huge Stargate fell down!BOOM!The Black Panther was heaven's will. In an instant, the entire Silver Moon world had merged with the beast. The only gap was its mouth.As for the mouth, it was sealed by the Stargate. This was created by a top neo martial expert and even had the effect of isolating the great Dao universe ... And Li Hao wanted to take advantage of this-the great Dao universe that isolated the great Dao universe, the Crimson Moon's great Dao universe! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, the venerable sovereign finally understood!Not good!The Stargate sealed the great Dao!BOOM!The Stargate was instantly closed, just like how the bone corrosion Thearch had entered the Silver Moon. On the day the Stargate was closed, the radiation range of the Crimson Moon great Dao universe was instantly blocked outside the Stargate.The venerable sovereign's expression changed, and he charged at Li Hao.He had to get out!The Stargate could completely shield him from the radiation of the great path universe. He had been outside the Silver Moon all this time. If Li Hao and the others had used the origin universe, they would have been weakened together.However, the Silvermoon people did not use the great Dao of origins.Li Hao exhaled and laughed."It's so F * cking hard to deal with. I wanted to kill a peak venerable sovereign ... But now ... I'll just let it be!"This time, he swung his sword again and slashed out!At the same time, the Silver Moon and the giant beast merged into one. Heaven's will controlled the space. All of a sudden, a vacuum appeared around Red Moon Emperor. The two universes merged into one and the Thunder of the great Dao appeared!Three attacks came at the same time!BOOM!The Thunderbolts exploded, the long sword slashed down, and the Heaven's Will suppressed the venerable sovereign, who had cut off the connection with the Crimson Moon Avenue. His breath fell, and his face changed dramatically. This time, he had been too careless. He did not know enough about the function of the Stargate.Who knew that the closing of the Stargate had actually blocked the great path of the universe?His strength had already declined a lot. At this moment, it dropped even more. Red Moon sovereign roared as the sword slashed down. He could no longer block it. The sword was broken and he was cut in half.He was still alive!He quickly began to merge and growled,""This place is within the range of the Crimson Moon's radiation ...""The new martial artist is much more threatening than me!"Li Hao smiled. I know.However, neo martial seemed to be nearby ... Although it looked quite far away, would the Crimson Moon world still have the time to care about him?He struck out with his sword again, and tens of thousands of DAOs converged as he slashed down!The newly fused body was once again shattered, and the other party once again converged and was once again shattered ...The power of the red moon spread out crazily, trying to escape, but it was gathered by the will of heaven. Li Hao slashed again and again, and a long river appeared, circling around and gradually closing in!

2568 Chapter 427
In the end, a bloody shadow appeared above the long river. The venerable sovereign's face was extremely ugly."If you kill me, the great Dao will be in turmoil. The Crimson Moon world will know that I have fallen ... They can spare my life, imprison me or seal me ... The Crimson Moon world will only think that I have not returned ..."At this moment, the venerable sovereign knew that he was in big trouble.He instantly knew that at this moment, his life was his top priority.The meaning in his words was not without reason.If he killed him, a venerable sovereign would die, even if it was separated by the Stargate. Just like last time, this place was within the radiation range of the Crimson Moon universe. Others might not know, but the master of the Crimson Moon would definitely know!As long as he didn't die, he would still have a chance.The world of the Crimson Moon must have known that he was in trouble. Although neo martial had caused a big commotion, the world of the Crimson Moon was not a weak world. It was still possible to transfer an expert over to save him.A third rank venerable sovereign was not someone who Shi Gu could abandon at will."If you know, then you know!"Li Hao laughed. Didn't you, Red Moon, know that neo martial had caused such a big commotion?So what?It would be troublesome if he didn't kill him. It was not easy to trap a venerable sovereign. The eight trigrams Formation left by the blood Emperor had been broken. To trap a venerable sovereign, he would need at least a universe!The lightning tribulation hadn't dissipated yet. The chaos lightning tribulation had been swallowed and ER Mao was still trying to resist it. There were so many problems and he didn't have time to suppress him.Taking advantage of the aftermath of the neo martial arts, he would kill them first.The long river instantly turned into ten thousand swords!Ten thousand swords piercing through the heart!BOOM!Explosions sounded again, and the power of the Crimson Moon spread in the river. For a moment, even Li Hao was affected. He was still resisting. The power of the Crimson Moon spread in the river, as if he was trying to take control of it.At this moment, Li Hao had to admit ... This guy was much stronger than the bone erosion, much, much stronger.Even at this point, he was still trying to turn the tables.BOOM!The river trembled, and Time and Stars rolled in the river. Thousands of sword wills burst out again, destroying the power of the Crimson Moon.The Crimson Moon's power had been completely destroyed.But Li Hao still didn't give up.Even the death of a venerable sovereign had shaken the Crimson Moon great Dao universe and attracted the attention of the experts. It was impossible for this even stronger venerable sovereign to be so quiet. There would definitely be some commotion!Soon, Li Hao seemed to have discovered something. He suddenly slashed at the end of the river!It was connected to the void Dao universe.In the virtual Dao universe, Qian Wuliang's expression changed as he realized something. With a sudden roar, a red light appeared in his eyes and shot out!Qian Wuliang's aura weakened a lot in an instant. He looked at the red light and felt a little scared. He was too confident and thought that the power of the Crimson Moon couldn't penetrate his body.But now ... He realized that he had been unknowingly invaded!The red light turned into a human figure, and the appearance of the venerable sovereign appeared! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 This time, the other party revealed a look of despair.""How did you find out ..." He was very secretive!"When Shi Gu died, the Crimson Moon great Dao universe once shook ...""Bastard!"The venerable sovereign was extremely furious!Damn it! Bone erosion, this piece of trash, this B * stard, can't even calm people down even after his death. If Li Hao had not experienced it before, he would not have known that it would cause such a commotion.There was no such movement when killing a Chaos Beast.BOOM!The sword light came, and with a boom, The Phantom completely exploded.This time, he wasn't angry. He just felt helpless."Bone erosion ... Bastard!"He had died at the hands of the eroding bones.Otherwise ... This person might not be able to discover anything, and he could hide and seize the void Dao universe controlled by Qian Wuliang. By then, he would be able to break through Silver Moon from the inside and have a great chance of turning the tables!Unfortunately ... He didn't have the chance this time.At this moment, as The Phantom collapsed, a corner of the universe appeared vaguely outside the Chaos Beast. Suddenly, a faint voice came,""What?"It was red Moon master. She had discovered something.The venerable sovereigns had fallen!The venerable sovereign who had gone to find the Silvermoon world had died!It was unbelievable!Even if the little silver Moon appeared again, he should not have the strength to kill a third stage venerable sovereign. A third stage venerable sovereign was more powerful than an ordinary master of a small world.Even if it was a medium-level world, a newly promoted medium-level world Lord would only be at the third stage.If they sent a stage three venerable sovereign there, they could even fight a medium-sized world. Furthermore, they were still within the radiation range of the Crimson Moon great cosmos, so there were no medium-sized worlds there.……At that moment, in the Crimson Moon world.In the huge Hall.An extremely powerful existence turned his head and looked in one direction. That place was still within the radiation range of the Crimson Moon world. It was at the corner of the land and was very far away. However, it would not take too long to rush over.However ... This extremely powerful existence remained silent for a while and didn't go forward.It was just a small problem.The big trouble was neo martial.Once he left, once Fang ping suddenly attacked ... It might be a plan to lure the Tiger out of the mountain. These neo martial artists looked reckless, but in reality, they had a lot of tricks up their sleeves. Once he left, it would be a huge problem for him if Fang ping launched a surprise attack on the great world and broke it.Moving the great world would cause too much of a commotion, and it would take a longer time.Furthermore, he had already sensed that the Dark Moon world was frantically moving towards him ... That was also a venerable sovereign who was infinitely close to the seventh rank. Compared to the death of a third rank venerable sovereign, this place was more important!

2569 Chapter 427
"Ying hun has fallen!"A loud voice suddenly resounded in the hall.Normally, the sudden death of a third level venerable sovereign would be a huge shock.But today...The main hall was much quieter."Ying hun has gone to Silver moon's side ... Did the new martial artists send someone there?" someone finally spoke up after a while.He didn't care too much about this person's death, but he was worried about whether a powerhouse had gone to neo martial arts.After all, Silver Moon was just too close to him.There were enough major events today.Two seventh-level venerable sovereigns of the major worlds had died, and a bunch of venerable sovereigns of other levels had fallen. Most of the venerable sovereigns of the Elysian world and the darkest world had been killed, except for a few who had escaped!Many of those who escaped would become Wanderers or chaos Rangers, and they would not dare to stay in the vicinity.One of Hong Yue's level three venerable sovereigns had died ... But today, it didn't shake much.When Shi Gu died, the commotion was bigger than today."I'm not sure ..."Red Moon Master's Voice was still loud.""It's at the edge of the area. I didn't see many of them when I spread my great Dao over. However, to be able to kill a rank three venerable sovereign, even if Ying hun had just advanced, he's not someone the Silvermoon people can kill ..."Then, he said slowly,"the nethermoon world is moving here. Today, the outbreak of neo martial will definitely shake the world. Even though the chaos rumors say that Crimson Moon and neo martial colluded, this time, everyone is in danger. There must be more worlds willing to move closer to Crimson Moon. Next, we have to welcome the powerhouses from all worlds ... I can't move, but the other powerhouses also have to welcome the strongest from all worlds ...""Is there anyone who is willing to head to Silvermoon's location to investigate ..."p silence.a stage three venerable sovereign was dead. at present, it was still uncertain who had killed him.If it was killed by a neo martial artist, and if there were still neo martial artists lingering there, a neo martial artist who had just destroyed two worlds was really terrifying.Who would dare to go?"I'm willing to go!"Someone finally spoke after a long time. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 After all, the red moon world was not weak. The red moon master took a look and saw that the speaker was a fourth stage venerable sovereign, who was considered a top-tier one in the red moon.He considered for a moment and nodded slightly,"okay!" However ... If they were out of the radiation range of the great Dao, they should stop chasing! If he's still within range, there's no need to act rashly. We'll observe the situation first ...""Yes, sir!"The expert who had accepted the mission was a little solemn, but he also felt more at ease.He was still within the red moon's range. He was a fourth-stage top-tier venerable sovereign, and ordinary medium-level world Lords could not do anything to him. If there was trouble, he could at least hold him back.Red Moon master did not say anything more.Silver moon's side was only having a small fight.At this moment, the most important thing was the neo martial world!He was a little solemn. Neo martial was stronger than expected. The key was that Emperor Cang and the human King were borrowing each other's strength. They had to be prepared to defeat each other. Otherwise, if the two were separated, even if one was killed, the other could escape.…… At the same time.Li Hao lay on the river, motionless. In the air, lightning was still erupting. Second cat was already scorched, but he didn't make a sound.At this moment, er Mao didn't try to stop it ... No one could stop the huge Silver Moon.The Silver Moon's tribulation had not been completely passed.The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was still ongoing.And now, he had only passed the ninth.The death of the two venerable sovereigns wasn't the end of the Silver Moon's tribulation. At this moment, Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and the others all rushed over with heavy expressions.Silvermoon had used up almost everything he had to deal with the two venerable sovereigns.Li Hao's frequent use of the power of time made the lightning tribulation even more powerful.The first wave of nine lightning bolts had passed. Now, er Mao had no more energy to continue. The next wave would be even stronger.At the moment, Black Panther was unable to use his venerable sovereign body.The body of a venerable sovereign was the key to isolating more lightning.As long as he dealt with the Thunder tribulation that had just been devoured, there was still hope of success. Once the Black Panther moved and cut off the power of isolation, more Thunder might be born. The dark clouds in the sky were still very thick, and there might be another wave of nine Thunder tribulations.Heaven's Fate also flew toward Li Hao in a sorry state. He said helplessly, "It's already beyond our expectations to be able to deal with two venerable sovereigns ... But this lightning tribulation ... Is not over yet!"He looked at second cat worriedly. Second cat's fur was completely burnt. If this continued, he might be struck to death by one or two more.This won't do!Li Hao, however, didn't pay much attention to it. He looked at the sky and smiled. "They're targeting me. If I die, they'll naturally be gone!""This ...""Is it the same as last time?" Lin Hongyu asked hurriedly. As long as I reverse you and resurrect you, it'll be fine?"If that was the case, it was worth a try.However, was it enough to be so easy?Li Hao said nothing. He looked at the Stargate and frowned."Without the eight-trigram array, the Stargate won't last long, though it can isolate chaos. It'll be activated again soon ...""The world is advancing, and the flow of time is the same ... The Stargate will probably not be able to hold on for long ..."Everyone looked at him. What did he mean?Heaven's Fate understood and said in a deep voice,"You mean, if you die this time, the Stargate will no longer be able to isolate the chaos, and resurrecting you will still trigger the chaos lightning tribulation?"Li Hao nodded slightly.At this moment, everyone's expression changed.This meant that the lightning tribulation wouldn't end until he passed it.Resurrecting Li Hao again would still trigger the lightning tribulation, and it might be even stronger. Resurrecting again and again would only lead to endless lightning tribulations!
