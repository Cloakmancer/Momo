        just laughed and didn't go out. He directly told the people outside to prepare and eat at the inspection Office.
        He was the boss of white moon city's Inspection Office. Here, no one could refute him.
        ……
        At noon.
        The inspection office's internal canteen, second floor.
        Wang Henggang usually didn't drink, but today he prepared a lot of wine and insisted on pouring wine for Liu Long. Liu Long didn't drink either, but he didn't refuse.
        "Old Liu, to be honest, I chose to stay back then because I wanted to fight for a chance for the people of Silver City ... Whether you believe it or not, I have no reason to lie to you."
        "At that time, the province said to merge and move all the small cities, but no one in the White moon City could say anything to Silver City, and no one would help us ... I stayed and looked for opportunities. After a few years, relying on my strength, I climbed to the position of the inspector of white moon City. If we talk about the migration now, at least I can have a say ..."
        "Those guys," Wang Henggang sneered,"didn't they say that Silver city's people were scattered because we don't have anyone above us? If there were people above, how many people were there in the Silver City? A million people. White moon City is a large city with a population of more than 30 million ... It's not difficult to get some supers to build a small city near White moon City to accommodate a million people!"
        "Outside the White moon City, there are countless fertile fields, many of which are barren. The people of the Silver City can bear hardships ... Here, as long as we settle down, we can recover in a few years ..."
         Liu Long didn't say anything.
        Whether it was true or not, only he knew.
        However, if Wang Heng was really able to go further and reach Kong Jie's position, then even if silver City moved, it would only take a word from him to settle down such a small population.
        Li Hao didn't usually drink, but at this moment, he also took a sip. He felt the burning sensation. He clicked his tongue and took a sip of tea. Then, he smiled and said,""Big brother Wang, why do you have to keep an eye on white moon City? Although my Silver City is small, it's surrounded by empty land. We can expand in all directions!"
        "In the past, the Silver City was still the capital of the Silver Moon Kingdom. When the people of the Silver City grew stronger ... We became the Masters of our own territories! What migration ... You should be migrating to my Silver City!"
        "Good ambition!"
        Wang Heng shouted and then burst into laughter.
        He really treated it as a joke.
        Li Hao wasn't weak, and he wasn't weak either. Some experts had come from Silver City, but ... It was almost impossible for the huge Silver Moon province to once again have Silver Moon City as its core.
        The Silver City's surroundings were indeed very small. In the past, the Silver City wasn't small, but later on, some of the Laocheng District were abandoned.
        After all, it was the capital of the past.
        But ... The transportation in Silver City was inconvenient, and the construction was backward. Further north was the mountain, and it was said that there were other countries on the other side of the mountain. If they moved to Silver City, they would really be asking for trouble.
        Moreover, Wang Henggang was very clear about how many experts there were in white moon City. Each one of them was hiding. As one of them, he still knew a little.
        Li Hao was talking in his sleep.
        Young man, you've only taken a small sip and you're already a little drunk.  On the side, Liu Long suddenly became very heroic,"Wang, you think it's a joke, but I took it seriously! Why not? Silver City wasn't any worse than any other place. Even if it didn't become the capital city again, why couldn't it have one Prefecture and two cores? With the transverse Canyon as the boundary, the White moon City will be the main force in the South, and the Silver City will be the main force in the North. What's impossible about that?"
        "We'll build another heavenly bridge to connect the north and south. Silver Moon is the most suitable for dual cores, and now, with white moon City as the main force, the 16 cities in the North have long been suffering unspeakable hardships!"
        There were 32 cities in Silver Moon, and it was a coincidence that with the cross-section Canyon as the boundary, there were 16 cities in the north and south.
        In the past, it was actually a dual-core, and silver City was later destroyed.
        Now, the 16 cities in the North were having a hard time. Under the influence of Whitemoon city and the rapid rise of yaoguang city, the 16 cities in the South were generally richer than those in the North. Naturally, they had more powerhouses.
        "Dual-core?"
        Wang Heng was slightly stunned, but he quickly laughed,"Then ... Let's work in that direction!"
        He didn't want to give them another blow. He actually wanted to, but he knew it was too difficult.
        This was not just a matter of strength, but also manpower and material resources, as well as a large number of problems for the People's livelihood. These were all very difficult to solve.
        After the meal, some of the estrangement from back then might not have been completely eliminated, but no one mentioned it again.
        After the meal, Li Hao and the other man took their leave.
        ……
        In the car.
        On the way back, Li Hao drove the car, while Liu Long leaned back in his chair, lost in thought.
         After a long time, Li Hao knocked against a large rock, which woke him up. Liu Long was not surprised. He suddenly said,"Li Hao, do you think my bragging will come true?"
        "Is it difficult?"
        Li Hao laughed. He rolled down the window, pointed at the air, and shattered the big rock under the wheel. Then, he continued driving.
        "The north and south cores are actually the best for Silver Moon. However, with the rise of superpowers, Minister hou and the others are unwilling to be distracted, giving others an opportunity."
        "Silver Moon actually has all the financial and human resources. What it lacks is actually the powerhouses to keep watch over the North."
        p "If we were to reach Minister hou's level, we wouldn't need the Whitemoon city to pay anything. If we propose this idea, the Whitemoon city would naturally satisfy us." This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Minister hou and the others ..."
        Liu Long's mind wandered once again. "One shot to kill Xuguang?"
        Was that even possible?
        Li Hao took the opportunity to say,"boss, I've thought about it. We'll get to know each other and get to know each other in the next two days. After a few days, we'll take our people across the Hengduan Canyon and head north!"
       
        "What?"
        "Clear out the supers in the 16 Northern cities!"
        Li Hao smiled and said,"in the South, the four major organizations are there. We can't eat meat!" Therefore, he had to go north. Furthermore, the North is our home base, so there should be a lot of active supers there ..."
        "In addition, I've thought about it, our hundred man team will be called demon hunt squads in the future! Silver City Demon hunt squad ...... Forget it, it's not appropriate to add Silver City to the list. There aren't many people in swords gate from Silver City, so let's just call it a demon hunt squad!"
        Li Hao chuckled,"we can't let our small team just disappear like that. The mission of our demon hunt squad is still the same as before ... To protect justice!""
        To protect justice ...
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Demon hunting!
        For a moment, Liu Long was in a daze. He glanced at Li Hao and didn't say anything for a long time.
        The demon hunting squad that he had created didn't die out?
        Li Hao actually named this new army a demon hunt squad, which was beyond his expectations.
         "Boss ..."
        "En!"
        Liu Long's spirit suddenly rose and he was somewhat excited,"Then ... We'll be called demon hunt squads?"
        "Of course!"
        Li Hao then smiled."We're not going back now. I'll take you to see the sea. Boss, how about we go together?"
        "Look at the sea ..."
        Liu Long's eyes flickered, and he nodded. Then, he went to look at the sea.
        He had not been there for a long time.
        ……
        Moon ocean.
        A few thousand meters away from the Wei Wu Army, a car stopped.
        The beach was right in front of them.
        In front of the beach was the boundless ocean.
        Li Hao stopped the car and got out. His leather boots sank deep into the sand as he looked into the distance and said,""This is still a tributary of the sea? It's endless ... I can't even see the end. Is this just a tributary of the North Sea?"
        He could see very far, but no matter how far he could see, he couldn't see the end.
        And this was only a branch of the North Sea.
        How vast and majestic was the North Sea?
        At this moment, the ocean was very calm. It was not as magnificent as everyone had said, and the waves were monstrous.
        At this moment, Liu Long also got out of the car. He looked into the distance and smiled,""The moon sea is very large, but ... It is said that the North Sea is even more vast! I've never been to the North Sea, I've only seen the moon sea. "
        "It's a pity that there aren't any waves today. Otherwise, what you're seeing wouldn't be like this. Although the moon sea is only a branch, when the waves hit, it's still abnormally terrifying!"
        "Boss, has your wave force improved recently?"
        "Average."
        "Boss, why don't you ... Go play in the sea?"
        "What?"
        Liu Long looked at Li Hao in confusion.
        "The power of waves is more suitable when we are in a place with water. Boss, empty waves is now a warrior with a thousand fighting abilities, a God on land ... Empty waves, go and create some. Let me see a real God on land!"
        Liu Long was stunned for a moment.
         艹!  You want me to go into the sea and make waves for you?
        You have to know that this is the sea!
        This wasn't a small river, nor was it a pond. If it was a pond or river, he could easily overturn it, but this was the moon sea!
        Li Hao, this kid, isn't he overestimating me?
        "Boss, let's go and try!"
        "You ..."
        Liu Long was speechless, but in the next moment, he suddenly laughed,"Alright!"
        Then let's try it!
        After saying that, he shot up and headed straight for the sea.
        I'll try it!
        Ever since he had comprehended force, he had never come to the moon ocean again. Today was a calm day without any wind or waves. Looking at the ocean was actually not very interesting. To look at the ocean, one had to look at the magnificence of the waves!
        In an instant, he shot out and appeared above the sea in the blink of an eye.
        He stepped on the surface of the sea and moved forward.
        As for Li Hao, he also rose into the air and quickly fell into the sea.
        In front of them, Liu Long's pride exploded. He walked on the water for a few hundred meters, and when he was almost a thousand meters away from the coastline, he said in a clear voice, "We're too close to each other, so we can't create waves. It's almost the same here ... Li Hao, I'll show you the power of the waves!"
        As soon as he finished speaking, he threw a punch!
        BOOM!
        Nine huge waves appeared, and with a punch, the sea water exploded. Some waves appeared in the calm sea, but ... Very quickly, these waves were absorbed by the sea. A weak wave slowly approached from the distance.
        On Li Hao's side, the water only rippled slightly. There was almost no reaction. It was unknown whether the ripples were natural. After all, even the calmest water surface had some waves.
        In the distance, Liu Long felt a little embarrassed.
        In the next moment, he roared again and punched out. The waves splashed and the nine-layered waves swept out!
        This time, a small Whirlpool exploded, causing the surrounding water to fluctuate, but ... That was all!
        Liu Long frowned and shouted again!
        One punch after another, the nine waves stacked.
        Li Hao watched in silence. Gradually, a wave rose in the distance. It was not big, just slightly above the water. The wave began to sweep toward the shore, one wave after another ...
        It had been very calm the entire time, and there was nothing to be afraid of.
         At the back, Liu Long had also gathered all his strength and roared madly. One punch after another, he did not stop at one place, but followed a line, striking out a white line.
        The waves began to sweep across.
        One wave after another!
        At a distance of about a thousand meters, the waves came one after another.
        "Hualala ..."
        The sound of water.
        It pushed the waves toward Li Hao. Five hundred meters, three hundred meters, one hundred meters ...
        By the time they were about a hundred meters away from Li Hao, the waves had already accumulated and were several meters above the normal water level.
        At this moment, the waves were sweeping faster and faster.
        Gradually, when they were less than 30 meters away from Li Hao, Li Hao's expression changed.
       
        The waves, which were not too strong at first, hit the reef on the shore in an instant.
        BOOM!
        It exploded!
        At this moment, the waves exploded and charged at Li Hao with a boom. Li Hao did not Dodge. His eyes flickered, and he punched out. There was also the faint sound of waves.
        However, this punch only broke some of the splashes in front of him. The next moment, more splashes came crashing down on him!
        Bang! Bang!
        It was only a splash, but at this moment, it hit the stone, making a loud sound like a cannonball.
        Li Hao was also hurt by the wave.
        Waves!
        Stacking waves!
         However, this was only Liu Long's doing. From a thousand meters away, Liu Long was constantly creating waves, again and again, and constantly brandishing his fists.
        He was in a good mood.
        However, he soon felt something different. He looked into the distance, and in the next moment, his expression changed slightly. At this moment, there seemed to be dark clouds in the distance, and a breeze was gradually blowing.
        The sea breeze was not strong at first, but it gradually became stronger.
        Furthermore, the dark clouds were approaching very quickly ...
        In the blink of an eye, the wind grew stronger.
        Seeing this, Liu Long immediately ran away. He had gone too far. No, he wasn't playing this game. There was really a sea breeze today. Li Hao wanted to see the waves, and now he would have something to see!
        ……
        On the shore, Li Hao was still fighting against the waves.
        When he saw Liu Long running over, he immediately smiled and said,""Boss, it's not bad, but ... It doesn't feel too different from the river, except that the sea water is salty ..."
        Liu Long had originally wanted to remind him, but seeing his attitude ... He immediately stopped.
        In any case, no matter how big the waves were, they wouldn't kill Li Hao.
        "Well, it's okay ... Wait a little longer. There will be a small wave coming. Be careful."
        "Alright!"
        Li Hao chuckled, but gradually, a gust of wind blew over. It was getting stronger and stronger, and the wind made him feel uncomfortable.
        Just as he looked up and saw a dark cloud ...
        In the distance, a tall white wall appeared. It wasn't a wall, but a wave.
        Li Hao's expression changed. Were these real waves?
        Was it very powerful?
        He wanted to try!
        "Hualala ..."
        The sound of the water rippled. In the distance, Liu Long had already reached the shore. Seeing that Li Hao was still waiting there, he laughed."You brat, I'll let you have a taste of my power. Otherwise, you'll think you're really strong."
        Just as he was gloating, a loud boom resounded through the sky!
        BOOM!
        The lightning-like waves crashed down instantly!
        At this moment, Li Hao felt as if he was in the wind and rain. He quickly stepped on the water, rose into the air, and punched out. He roared like a tiger, but the sound of the waves suppressed it so that it couldn't be heard.
        Li Hao wanted to try and see if the waves could suppress his fist!
        BOOM!
        Li Hao soared into the sky and punched through the waves. He chuckled. That was all ...
         The next moment, he raised his head and was somewhat shocked ... And?  The second wave!
        Li Hao roared again. BOOM!
        Another wave was smashed.
        He didn't have time to look when the third wave came crashing down. With a bang, Li Hao's face was covered in dirt and he was soaked.
        Li Hao roared and waved his fist again!
        BOOM!
        BOOM!
        BOOM!
        One strike after another, like the nine-refinements force, the waves were endless. Li Hao was also very strong, and every punch he threw could break the waves.
        However, the first time, the second time, the third time ...
        After a few hundred times, Li Hao couldn't take it anymore.
        He cursed in his heart!
        You're not done, are you?
        Moreover, every time he punched and broke the waves, the counterattacks of the waves behind him would be stronger, each higher than the last. This time, Li Hao finally understood that ... The power of nature was truly infinite!
        If he was a human, he would have been killed long ago.
        However, it was not people on the other side, but the waves that seemed endless!
        If you don't know fatigue, the more you fight, the bigger the waves.
        Li Hao roared and punched with his Tiger fist. BOOM!
        An even higher wave came crashing down on him, causing the Tiger to fall silent.
        He punched again and smashed again!
        Li Hao was fighting the waves like a fool.
        On the shore, Liu Long looked at the increasingly strong waves and frowned slightly. Li Hao's waves weren't too big at first, but now they were getting bigger and bigger.
        If they kept fighting like this, Li Hao would be like a tireless Mad Dog. All the power he used was actually absorbed by the sea, creating stronger waves for him.
        If Li Hao continued fighting for too long, he wouldn't create a tsunami, would he?
        "I don't think so!"
        ……
        "Hu!"
        Li Hao panted, but he was in a good mood. Waves, stacking force ...
         This was the first time he felt the stacking force of the waves. One wave after another, the feeling was endless. He was very excited and even wanted to shout a few times. This place was actually suitable for practicing the ninth training force.
        They were natural enemies and didn't need anyone to train with them.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As long as you stupidly hit the waves, you would have a sparring partner.
        One punch, one punch, one punch ...
        With the nine-refinements stacking, Li Hao's ability to imitate was very strong. He felt the continuous force between the waves. That feeling of unending force gave him a deeper understanding of the nine-refinements.
        He didn't want to comprehend force, he just wanted to quickly reach the eighth-fold from the ninth-refinement force.
        When he completed nine stacks one day, perhaps he would be able to naturally form water wave force.
        The waves on the other side were getting stronger and stronger, as if they were angry. Someone dared to use human strength to block heavenly energy!
        BOOM!
        Li Hao staggered slightly as the waves crashed against him. He was somewhat shocked that the waves were getting stronger.
       
        "Li Hao, come back!"
        "Wait!"
        Li Hao roared. Go back for what?
        This place is so suitable for cultivating the ninth-refinement force!
        Another punch was thrown. BOOM!
        The waves hit again ...
        Li Hao's punches never stopped. He was still very strong. Although he couldn't kill the waves, he felt that it would be fine even if he stood there and fought for hours.
        Just as he was thinking, this time, it was no longer just one wave. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Finally, Li Hao's body was covered in internal force, which he began to resist. Otherwise, his body would not be able to withstand it.
        He felt that he was almost done with the eight-layered force.
        It was so comfortable to practice martial arts here!
         Bang! Bang!
        With a loud noise, Li Hao was slapped into the sand by a terrifyingly high wave, sinking deeply.
        Li Hao quickly crawled out. Just as he did, BOOM!
        It was another wave, and his face was particularly painful.
        ……
        On the shore.
        Liu Long let out a sigh. This idiot ... This is the first time he's seen the ocean, and he's still so na?ve. This is the ocean, not a Lake. A Lake has a boundary, so no matter how big the waves are, they'll actually stop and lack momentum.
        However, the sea was boundless. The more you resisted, the more powerful the sea would be. The waves behind would push the waves in front. Under the fluctuations, some big waves that would not appear on this side would even sweep toward you.
        You little brat, just wait until you come back crying.
        He sat down and admired the view in silence.
        Li Hao kept fighting against the huge waves in the sea, and his roars kept echoing, but they barely spread out. Only the sound of the waves could be heard.
        Boom! Boom! Boom!
        This area quickly became a region of thunder and lightning. The sound reverberated, and the Wei Wu Army nearby could feel the madness of the waves.
        Ten minutes, twenty minutes ...
        Half an hour later, a huge wave sent Li Hao flying with a boom, and he fell into the water.
        In the next moment, Li Hao didn't even have time to get up before he was smashed down by an even stronger wave.
        Without giving Li Hao a chance to react, he attacked again and again.
        On the shore, Liu Long frowned slightly. He wouldn't be crushed to death, would he?
        At this moment, the waves were already crashing toward him.
        While he was thinking, in the distance, Li Hao was sent flying into the air, but he was smashed down again. Li Hao had used up a lot of energy. At this moment, he couldn't help but roar,""Boss, this thing, when can it ... Cough ... Stop ..."
        Liu Long could vaguely hear it. He was speechless and couldn't stop.
        "Of course, it's not like there's no other way. If you stop resisting and enjoy it in silence, you'll naturally stop once you're satisfied with the ocean.
        And Li Hao clearly understood the reasoning behind this.
        In the next moment, he no longer resisted and allowed the waves to smash him again and again, sending him flying everywhere. He was smashed out of the sea, smashed down again, and smashed away again ...
        He was like a rubber ball, allowing the huge wave to hit him.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After about ten minutes, the waves gradually became smaller, and there was no tsunami.
        ……
        Half an hour later, Li Hao got up from the beach, covered in sand.
        Beside him, Liu Long stretched out his hand and grabbed the crab off his head. He smiled and said,""How do you feel?"
        "Cool!"  Li Hao panted and laughed,"I've learned something new!" The force of nature was the truly terrifying one! The more I counterattack, the more the other side continues to attack until you are convinced ... However, in the end, I was also worried that I would cause even bigger waves that would hit the Wei Wu army camp. Otherwise, I could still hold on!"
        Liu Long was speechless.
        This guy, didn't he consume a lot of inner strength?
        However, when he thought about how this fellow could have sparred with him for an entire day, he had nothing to say. If he had just resisted the waves, he would have been beaten to the point of being unable to fight back.
        "Let's go. We can still have seafood when we get back ..."
        Liu Long picked up a big crab, a fish, and some scallops ...
        Li Hao chuckled and spat out some sand. He sensed it for a moment, then suddenly threw out a punch. He turned around and ran. This punch contained eight layers of force. Li Hao's face lit up with joy, and he hurriedly ran.
        As for Liu Long, he was slightly startled. He looked at him and was a little absent-minded. He was hit back by the sea, and his whole body was covered in water.
        He didn't pay much attention to it. Instead, he looked at Li Hao, who was running away, and suddenly smiled.
        This guy ... Was really F * cking talented!
        Eight overlapping!
        Although he hadn't reached the peak of the ninth-refinement force, how long had Li Hao been in contact with it?
        Even if his physical fitness was outrageously strong, to be able to punch eight times in a short period of time ... Was already extremely terrifying.
        In the distance, Li Hao burst into laughter!
        "Boss, when I'm done with my nine-fold, I'll come back and fight this ocean again!"
        He couldn't do it now. The ocean was boundless, and the waves were endless. Li Hao was tired.
        Liu Long shook his head slightly and didn't say anything. He turned around and looked at the sea that was gradually calming down. Suddenly, he also threw out a punch, and the waves swept out. BOOM!
        A huge hole was blasted in the sea, and the sea water swirled, forming a Whirlpool.
        Liu Long silently watched for a while until the whirlpool gradually disappeared. He then left. He had some feelings. The overlapping waves, the power of the whirlpool ...
        ……
        And at this moment, at the end of the moon sea, an even larger sea surface appeared.
        At this moment, on the sea, a fierce tiger roared and swallowed a powerful existence in one bite. With a claw, it tore the figure in its belly into pieces!
        The Tiger instantly collapsed and turned into a human figure.
        Yuan Shuo gasped for breath and laughed.
        The power of the water Tiger!
        The heart fire ape and the kidney Water Tiger had both reached the phenomenal success stage. Not only that, the third force was also erupting and was about to reach the phenomenal success stage. With the three forces combined, even if Xuguang came, he would still dare to fight ... Whether he could win or not was another matter.
        After killing this powerful peak three suns expert, Yuan Shuo gasped for breath and slashed out with his saber. A red shadow was slashed out by him. The stone saber swept out and the red shadow disappeared. Yuan Shuo also quickly turned into a fierce tiger and disappeared on the water.
        Li Hao's Tiger was a fire Tiger.
        His Tiger, however, was a Water Tiger.
         The Tiger was the King of the Mountains. However, the water Tiger was the Overlord of the sea at this moment. He was free and unfettered in the North Sea.
        It wasn't until Yuan Shuo had left that a figure quickly landed. However, the traces had long been washed away by the sea, and it was impossible to observe anything. It was a powerful existence with cold eyes.
        Yuan Shuo ... He's really something!
        He had originally thought that Yuan Shuo, the king of the five birds, would be powerless in the sea.
        In the end, this guy was also incomparably valiant in the sea.
        Five birds technique, five birds ... When did they start to run amuck in the ocean?
        "Inform the others that Yuan Shuo might have crossed the North Sea and entered the central region!"
        As the number of people increased, someone said with an ugly expression.
        Some of the ghostly faces nearby instantly disappeared.
        Yuan Shuo was probably about to enter the central region.
       
        In the blink of an eye, another day had passed.
        14th of September.
        It was clear.
        Today, with the arrival of the sixteen martial masters from the inspection Office, the number of demon hunt squads instantly rose to fifty-one.
        At the martial arts practice square.
        All 50 martial masters had arrived. At this moment, they were all a little nervous.
        The entire demon hunt squad was currently divided into two factions, the Silver City faction and the swords gate faction.
        The people from the inspection Office who came were all old acquaintances of Liu Long. Some of them were even his former law enforcement team members, but they had left with Wang Heng a few years ago.
        Regardless of whether it was the swords gate Martial Master or the inspection Office Martial Master, they were both nervous.
        They didn't understand Li Hao.
         Moreover, joining Li Hao's demon hunt squad wasn't something they fought for themselves, but rather recommended by their sect master, the Secretary of the inspection Division. Both Hong Yitang and Wang Henggang had a very high evaluation of Li Hao.
        Even though everyone felt that they might have overpraised him.
        Moreover, at this moment, many martial masters were watching the show from all directions.
        No one had expected that Li Hao would be able to gather a 100-man team so quickly. Although the number of people hadn't reached the target yet, it had only been a few days, and it was already very surprising that he could gather 50 martial masters.
        Apart from the Wei Wu Army, martial masters were rare nowadays.
        Swords gate was probably the biggest martial arts school in Silver Moon, even though the Head of the School was a super.
        Li Hao had not arrived yet.
        Some of the martial masters in the surroundings started whispering to each other.
        "A bunch of new recruits!"
        "But the quality is good. I heard that swords gate and the inspector's office have high hopes for him. Many of them have a cultivation base over 100, and there's even a Martial Master douqian."
        "Liu Long?"
        "Yes, that's him."
        "That's still alright. However, Liu Long has only stepped into the Dou Qian class not long ago. He might not be that strong."
        ,m "Do you guys think that guy will transfer us to join? After all, we only have 50 people right now. It's only half of them. The chiliarch seems to have agreed to transfer three people from each regimental unit, and ten people from the personal guards. "  "Are you going?"
        "I'm not going!"
        "Then that's it. Even if you ask me to go, I won't go. They're just a bunch of newbies. Their strength may be okay, but many of them here relied on their mysterious energy to get there. They're not even comparable to those with more tricks!"
        “……”
         One after another, the voices of these martial masters were very low, but they couldn't keep up with the crowd's discussion, which gave the demon hunt squad members a lot of pressure.  One had to know that there were nearly a hundred people here who had broken through the 100-point threshold.
        The gathering of Shi made these martial masters, who were at most in the late 100th stage, a little nervous. Liu Long was Dou Qian, but Liu Long was as quiet as a Buddha statue. He didn't move at all, and no one knew what he was thinking.
        Not only were the martial masters watching, but the douqian martial masters on the martial arts stage in the center of the square were also observing. However, they did not show it as obviously as the other martial masters and just went up one by one.
        At this moment, the intrepid Chen Jin sneered,"The speed isn't slow. In just a few days, you've pulled in so many people. The earth overturning sword is quite generous. You've even sent your own daughter!"
        As the successor of mountain breaker axe, he didn't like Li Hao.
        Even though he was beaten up, he was still unhappy.
        On the side, Luo qizhao, the tall and slender-armed descendant of the Luo family's spear technique, laughed when he heard this and whispered,""Lower your voice, don't you think you've been beaten enough?"
        "You didn't get beaten up?" Chen Jin cast him a glance.
        Who are you mocking?
        Out of the nine Centurions, five had been beaten, and the remaining four did not even have the chance to go on stage.
        Luo qizhao didn't get angry. Instead, he smiled and said,""There's nothing we can do even if we get beaten up. We're no match for him. However, he brought Liu Long along ... The silver spear's inheritor, he's quite strong. Do you guys think we can take him down if he makes a move?"
        "Him?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "We have only been in the warrior dimension for a short period of time. None of us have been in the warrior dimension for a few years. We have also gained all kinds of enlightenment from the ancient weapons, absorbed from the divine energy stone ... And eaten a lot of good things. Liu Long is still a little lacking."
        "Don't forget that everyone in Silver City is a freak. Not to mention the five king birds, how long has it been since Li Hao stepped onto the martial path? Can't Liu Long be the same as them?"
        The silver Blizzard city's Qian fighters had all advanced this year.
        However, each of them was more powerful than the last, more terrifying than the last, and their progress was so fast that you couldn't believe it.
        As one of the few female martial masters, Xie Lan interrupted their discussion and frowned."Li Hao gathered his people here. Is he going to start an official team? He has not recruited enough people yet ... They do not understand the Wei Wu Army's heavenly stars formation. If they train together, it will not be convenient for him to slowly replenish his manpower. "
         The Wei Wu Army had a formation, the great Tianxuan formation.
        A thousand people could form a formation, and a hundred people could also form a formation.
        Usually, they would train in teams of 100, but every five days, they would train together to familiarize themselves with the military formation so that they wouldn't encounter a strong enemy that they couldn't match.
        Li Hao's men weren't full yet, and they were all new, so it was hard for them to get familiar with it.
        Chen Jin snorted."I don't want to train with him. Besides, the Tianxuan formation can only accommodate 1000 people. There are more than 980 martial masters in the Army. If I join them, I'll exceed ..."
        "Chen Jin!"
        "Alright, it's normal for you to be indignant after knowing that your master was killed by his master!" Don't forget, this is the Wei Wu Army. Usually, no one will say anything, but if you keep harping on it, be careful of problems!"
        There were many grudges between martial masters.
        If he was still in the martial arts world, then he would not have any contact with him. He would either take revenge or give up on The Grudge.
        However, since he had joined the Wei Wu Army, and it was a matter of the previous generation, if he continued to pester him, he would only attract great trouble.
       
        Chen Jin didn't say anything else, but the look of indignation in his eyes was still clear.
        Of course, the others did not try to persuade him anymore.
        In the pugilistic world, when two people met, they would fight to the death. It was already good enough that they could live together.
        While they were chatting, Li Hao came from afar.
        Not only Li Hao, but golden spear and wood forest had also come.
        Seeing that they had arrived, everyone knew that Li Hao was really going to start a team today.
        ……
        "Li Hao," Mu Lin said,"your team isn't full yet, and you don't want to transfer the old people ... Isn't it too early to start a team now? the boss and the Minister both want to set the end of the year as the deadline ..."
        "It's almost time!"
        Li Hao was unmoved."The earlier we start the team, the earlier we work. The earlier we earn money. I can't even afford to be happy."
         Mu Lin was speechless.
        Li Hao didn't say anything else and quickly walked forward. The martial masters who were watching quickly retreated when they saw Li Hao. He wasn't a kind person and wasn't to be trifled with.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's pace was very fast. Very quickly, he arrived in front of the dozens of people.
        Looking at the crowd, he didn't beat around the bush and went straight to the point,""I won't say anything unnecessary. Everyone came here with the goal of becoming stronger! I, Li Hao, am a newcomer, and I don't know much about business, cooperation, and so on. Thus, this demon hunt squad still needs everyone to work together, sincerely cooperating, in order to have hope of making a name for themselves!"
        "I don't have many good points, and I don't have many flaws either ... If there's one thing that everyone is convinced of, it's my strength!"
        Li Hao pointed at the few Centurions in the distance.""There are nine thousand-man fighters over there. I've defeated five of them a few days ago, and the remaining four don't dare to fight me even if they join forces. If this still can't prove that my strength is enough to convince you ... You can have as many of you as you want, and you can all come at me together. If you can defeat me, then you have the final say. If you can 't, then I have the final say!"
        His voice wasn't soft.
        In the distance, the expressions of the few Centurions were very ugly, but they didn't say anything. Everyone had seen how they had been defeated last time, so what could they say?
        Although Li Hao had stepped on their faces, they could only accept their fate.
        As for the demon hunt squads, not everyone knew about this matter. At this moment, some of them had a strange look in their eyes, and when they looked over, their hearts were somewhat shaken.
        It seemed to be true!
        None of the nine Qian fighters were Li Hao's match.
        At this moment, he had a better understanding of this person from the five birds sect. He was very strong!
        At least among the martial masters, he was very strong!
        No wonder the sect master (Secretary) praised him so much. Among martial masters, strength was still important. As for other things, he would have to wait and see.
        As long as Li Hao could be relatively fair, not randomly pick a fight, and not intentionally send people to their deaths ... In the eyes of martial masters, he was a good leader. It was that simple.
         All of this sounded simple, but it was difficult to do.  Li Hao continued,"our 100-man team ... Only has 50 people. Not including me, we have exactly half of them." For the time being, I don't plan to recruit more people, since it would be inconvenient to have too many. 50 people are enough, from now on we will be called demon hunt squads!"
        "Everyone can just call me Regiment commander. A Centurion makes me seem like a low-ranking official!"
        “……”
        Behind them, golden spear and wood forest watched silently.
        Too low a position?
        This guy, to think he could say that.
        "The Vice-commander is Liu Long. He used to be my boss in Silver City, and he was also a warrior master!"
        Li Hao chuckled."We're both martial masters, so we should be more forthright. If there's anything you're not satisfied with, let's talk face to face. Don't complain behind our backs, which will hurt our feelings." I'm on good terms with senior uncle Hong and big brother Wang. Since they're willing to let you come here, they naturally trust me. I won't let their trust go to waste!"
        "Demon hunt squad, today is the official establishment of the squad. What does the establishment of the squad mean? It means that we will have to carry out military affairs, work, become stronger, earn money, and become stronger again ... Instead of spending our retirement in this base!"
        As soon as he said that, some of the martial masters in the outer circle were dissatisfied.
        Who was the hidden meaning behind these words?
        Martial masters didn't have to go on missions every day. They had to work and rest. Under normal circumstances, they would definitely go on missions for one to three months. Which time wasn't it a life-and-death battle?
        Why did Li Hao treat them as retired people?
        Li Hao suddenly pointed at Hong Qing and said,""Hong Qing, you're looking around. Do you have something to say? The next time you speak, just report it!"
        "Ah?"
         "I'm just shouting 'report'. Have you never gone to school?"
        “……”
        Hong Qing was a little embarrassed, she really didn 't, she had never been to school before. Of course, swords gate had its own private school, but it was different from a school.
        She was a little embarrassed to be scolded by Li Hao in public, but she felt that everyone was looking at her, so her face turned even redder. She had been quite natural and unrestrained, but now she was extremely nervous.
        Li Hao said loudly,"if you have something to say, say it!" What was there to be afraid of? In the past, I was also afraid of having too many people. When there were too many people, I would feel uncomfortable. But later on, I realized that having too many people was nothing. As long as you were stronger than them and spoke louder than them, they wouldn't dare to laugh at you. They would scold you behind your back and even feel a chill down their spine, afraid that you would hear them!"
        Hong Qing chuckled, but he quickly stopped and said hurriedly,""Reporting! Regi.....Regimental commander, you said that we have to carry out military affairs ..... W-what military affairs are we supposed to do?"
        "Murder!"
        "Ah?"
        "Murder!"
        Li Hao frowned."Be it a soldier or a Martial Master, in this era of war, the only goal is to kill!" "It's my first time being a soldier, so I don't know much about it. But at least I know one thing. In times of war, it's necessary to kill those bandits who do evil, disturb people's lives, kill people, Rob goods, and create chaos! What protecting the country, defending the land and expanding the borders ... We don't really understand it now, but we might understand it in the future. We'll talk about this later!"
       
        Since the Wei Wu Army had the word 'Army' in its name, it was naturally a soldier.
        Li Hao said that he didn't understand, and he really didn 't.
        Defending the land, expanding the territory, protecting the country ... He didn't understand these responsibilities, obligations, and heavy responsibilities.
        And now, he didn't need to understand.
        Hong Qing seemed to understand. He nodded and did not ask further.
        Ask and you kill!
        Li Hao's answer to them was simple.
        At this moment, someone from the inspector's office was also a little awkward, but he still shouted,""Reporting, Regiment commander!"
        "Speak!"
        "I want to ask if there are any rules, regulations, standards, and so on when we carry out missions ... Including the reward and punishment system, the period of mission completion, the officer who records military achievements, the examination system ..."
         Li Hao was a little confused. Yes, confused.
        However, it wasn't as if he didn't understand at all. It was just that he really didn't consider this. Thinking of this, he smiled. "What's your name?"
        "Milord ..."
        "Call me guild leader!"
        "Captain, my name is Li Heng!"
        "It's still the main clan!"
        Li Hao laughed."You're all from the silver Blizzard city, and you're from the same family ... Very good, I have high hopes for you. Write me a report with a detailed analysis and a detailed system. Since you're asking this, you must have some understanding. If you don't know, ask other teams. Once you've done it, I'll let you be the examiner!"
        “……”
        The Martial Master who asked the question wasn't too old. He seemed to be in his 30s.
        At this moment, he was a little speechless.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He glanced at Liu Long, but Liu Long didn't say anything. It wasn't a big problem.
        There weren't many people.
        There were only 50 people, so there was no point in creating too many systems. Of course, there were some necessary things that could be done. If he was in the demon hunting squad, he wouldn't even bother with them. However, things were different now.
        It was normal that Li Hao didn't understand. Let alone Li Hao, even Liu Long didn't know much about it. Thus, his demon hunting team didn't care about this at all. They only relied on his personal prestige to distribute and record achievements.
        ……
        "Boss!"
         At this moment, Mu Lin felt his teeth aching. He transmitted a message,""I feel that Li Hao is even more unreliable than I am. If it doesn't work out, let me be the centurion, or let him be the vice-captain. I'm worried for the members of his demon hunt squad, I don't want them all to die in a few days."  The Golden Spear's expression did not change as it looked on in silence.
        Hearing Mu Lin's nagging, he also transmitted a message,""Whether it's a mule or a horse, you'll know when you pull it out for a walk! Li Hao said that he's going to take people out to train for a few days and get the team in touch. At the same time, he's going to cooperate with the four great organizations to hunt down the people from the three great organizations ... Let's wait and see. "
        "Eh? He's taking his men out now?"
        Mu Lin was stunned. It had just been established.
        Li Hao probably didn't even recognize all the people in the team.
        Aren't you afraid of something happening?
        However, after thinking about it, he laughed and sent a message,""That's fine. In any case, the security around white moon City is still guaranteed. Although many of the Crimson Moon's supers have come to the Silver Moon, they don't dare to get too close to Whitemoon city. However, I heard that there are many supers gathering at the transverse Canyon. "
        It's good to go out and get used to it.
        With Li Hao around, their safety was not a problem.
        "Besides, you might not meet the people from the three major organizations even if you go out. They're not stupid. They know you're going to kill them. Unless they're confident in dealing with you, who would show up?
        They were all well hidden.
        The night watchmen might not even meet one every few days. Silver Moon was huge and had a population of over a hundred million. There were only a few thousand superpowers hidden among them. If the superpowers were restrained, would one be able to look for them one by one?
        This was what Jin gun was thinking.
        Therefore, he didn't refuse Li Hao's suggestion. Li Hao didn't want to take the ordinary path and didn't want to slowly get used to it. If he wanted to lead the team out ... That was fine.
        As for the relic that he had asked Li Hao to go with him, it was fine to delay it for a few days.
         As for heaven battling city's ruins, the soonest they would open would be on the 28th of this month, so there was still half a month to go.
        Moreover, it might not open this time. If it did not open this month, it might have to wait until next month, which was still early.
        ……
        At this moment, Li Hao spoke again in a loud voice,""The Wei Wu Army has many strong people! Our demon hunt squad has 51 people, two of which are douqian, and 20 of them are above 100. The rest of them are only at the 10th beheading realm...Very weak! There's not a single one who has broken through 100!"
        "Therefore, we now have our first goal ... To have all of our members surpass 100. This is the simplest goal!"
        "The rise of superpowers is not without benefits for us martial masters. I've decided that we'll go out of the city tomorrow to search for members of the three major organizations and kill them! The mysterious energy, the blood God, and the divine power Stone are all food for our transformation!"
        "Especially the members of the red moon. Almost all of them have a blood deity ... I'll think of a way to borrow an origin god weapon to extract the blood deity. As long as we kill more members of the red moon, everyone will be able to break through the late-stage hundred-realm!"
        Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell."I heard that a large number of experts have come to Crimson Moon. They're all gathering at Silver Moon!" "These people are the foundation of our strength, the foundation for our rise! "When everyone reaches the late-stage of breaking through 100, I still have the Enlightenment ancient weapon. I can let 10 people comprehend force. Those who kill the most and make the most contributions will be able to comprehend force when they break through 100 ... Whether they succeed or not, that'll be up for discussion! However, at least we have a chance!"
        "If there are people with good luck like me, breaking through 100 today, breaking through to the late 100 tomorrow, and comprehending force the day after tomorrow, it might be hard to say whether they will step into the Qian dynasty in a few days ... Anything is possible!"
        His words were simple, but the group of young martial masters in front of him were excited. However, the old martial masters were very calm.
       
        I know how to make empty promises, too.
        How could it be that simple?
        The members of the red moon were members of the three major organizations and had many experts. Moreover, one might not even be able to find the other party. Now, it was as if the other party was at one's disposal. It was a little too much.
        If they really met, it was still uncertain who would kill who.
        Although Li Hao was strong, Dou Qian was only comparable to sunlight. So what if Li Hao was comparable to three suns?
        Didn't the red moon have a three-Sun Expert?
        Therefore, only a few disciples of swords gate were a little excited. They were younger than Hong Qing and the others, they rarely took on missions, so they were all looking forward to it.
        As for the people from the inspection Office, they were all old foxes and were not moved at all.
        All members broke 100 ... It was so easy to say.
        With the help of the mysterious energy, it was indeed much easier for martial masters to break through 100, but it didn't mean that devouring the mysterious energy would allow them to advance.
         As for the clones of Blood God ... Each of them would need at least one. 29 tenth severing stage cultivators would need at least 29 blood clones of the Dark Moon level, which meant that he had killed 29 Dark Moon supers ... Or even more!
        That was because not everyone in the Crimson Moon had one.
        Besides, there were 29 dark moons. Did they not have the sun and three suns?
        It's all Yue Ming's fault, standing there and waiting for you to kill him?
        The more he understood, the more he felt that Li Hao was just making empty promises. First target ... Could it be that he had a stronger target?
        ……
        The other martial masters in the surroundings also had a contemplative look on their faces.
        Someone's voice was very low, with a hint of a smile."This person ... Has courage! Our Wei Wu Army has been established for so many years, and we still have close to half of the ten decapitation realm. "
        They had just been established, and all their members were about to break a hundred.
        Today, it broke a hundred, and tomorrow, it broke a thousand.
        If fighting Qian was so easy, would the entire Wei Wu Army only have so little Qian?
        There were actually quite a number of people who had broken through the 100th level. However, it was also a hurdle for them to cross into the Qianqian class. Although they had comprehended Shi, many of them had comprehended it through ancient weapons. The comprehension of ancient weapons also had its shortcomings, which was that it was not easy to become stronger!
        They lacked some deep understanding of force, which was why there were nearly 100 people who had broken through 100 levels and were still unable to enter the Dou Qian class.
        ……
        Li Hao didn't care if people believed him or not.
        He had only stated his goal and achieved it, so everyone would naturally believe him.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If he couldn't do it, then he would have wasted his eyes.
        If it was difficult for even 29 people in the ten decapitation realm to break through the 100-stage, then what was the use of the Wei Wu Army?
        Are you bringing a child to play?
        When he did it, everyone would naturally know whether he was bragging or not.
        "Right now, I declare that the demon hunt squad is officially open! Captain Jin gun and vice-captain Mu Lin, as your witnesses, I will be your commander from now on!"  Behind them, Jin Shan and Mu Lin nodded.
        The Golden spear actually wanted to say a few words ...
        But Li Hao didn't give him a chance.
        He felt that he didn't need to say much.
        He also felt that, as a senior, Jin gun might not want to give a long speech, so he said directly,""Many thanks to the two Sirs for witnessing the establishment of the demon hunt squad today, I will send the two Sirs off!"
        "Pa pa pa!"
        He started clapping!
        The martial masters in the surroundings rolled their eyes.
        What a perfunctory party opening ceremony.
        Jin Shan and Mu Lin were also speechless.
        This guy ...
        They had nothing to say. Forget it, the demon hunt squad was recruited by Li Hao himself, and he still hadn't received a single cent from the Wei Wu Army. It wasn't time for him to pay his salary yet, so he could just go and do whatever he wanted!
        As long as Li Hao wasn't afraid of trouble, Wang Henggang and Hong Yitang would come after him even if they were all killed.
        If Li Hao wanted to transfer manpower from their side, the two of them naturally wouldn't let him do as he pleased.
        Gold spear and wood forest left immediately, no longer accompanying Li Hao. In their eyes, Li Hao was indeed interested in playing. What training? he was just going on a sightseeing tour, right?
        ……
        Li Hao didn't care about them.
        He looked at the demon hunt squad member in front of him, and continued,"In addition, we're going to select five squad leaders! 10 people in a team, the leader has been confirmed, the other 9 must listen to orders and not act on their own!"
        "In the future, I will only give missions to the five captains!"
        Li Hao looked at the crowd."I'll choose myself. You probably won't be happy!" There aren't many of us, only 20 of us have broken through 100, so we'll choose from those who have broken through 100 ... Of course, those who feel that they can kill enemies above their level in the tenth realm can also participate!"
         "Of the 20 of you, whoever is willing to be the team leader can exchange a few moves."
        The crowd looked at each other and hesitated.
        Li Hao laughed,"no idea?" Then I will say one more thing, according to the rules of the Wei Wu Army, when we go out to carry out missions, all the gains will be ours. And as the captain of the demon hunt squad, I have the right to distribute them. Of course, I don't want much, only thirty percent! Vice commander Liu of the thousand battle Guild would get ten percent. The remaining 60% will be given to everyone. "
        "And this 60% will be split among the 49 of you. Each team leader will be in charge of nine people. After the distribution is based on contribution, the team leader will get an extra 10% of the other nine people's harvest, which is equivalent to double the loot!"
        “……”
        Everyone's expression changed slightly.
        He didn't know if he would gain anything, but what if he did in the future?
        The team leader could still get 10% of the harvest for the others in the team. The others only got 10% less, which didn't feel like much, but the team leader got double the harvest!
        The difference was too great!
        "Regimental commander," Hong Qing could not help but ask hurriedly,"if that's the case, doesn't that mean that there's a huge gap between those who aren't team leaders and those who are?"
       
        "Of course!"
        Li Hao nodded,"strength speaks for itself!" If you have confidence, then fight! If he won it, he would naturally have a chance. "Moreover, it's not a fixed team. It's just a 10-man team. Even if the team leader is changed every day, it won't have too big of an impact. So, you have to re-select once a month. If you think you're strong enough, then challenge ... Everyone has a chance."
        "But cutting ten levels is a bit worse than breaking a hundred. Isn't this ten percent less than what we'll get?"
        A Martial Master of the tenth realm was also anxious.
        No one would remain silent when it came to benefits.
        Li Hao laughed."It's easier to improve in the ten decapitation realm. As long as you're not a perfected Martial Master and don't have force, it's not hard to catch up to a hundred martial masters!" Have more confidence in yourself. Besides, you're weak ... And yet you want to get more? is this fair? Fairness is built on the foundation of equal strength!"
        "And as the captain, you naturally have to pay more. Killing the enemy is your priority, and it's not like you're just sitting there and splitting the money. The demon hunt squad only has so few people, and I'm not blind, can't I see who contributed and who didn 't?"
        At this moment, the 100 martial masters were all ready to make a move.
        Although he had not obtained anything yet, it was not a loss to take the position of team leader first.
        Among the 20 people who had broken through the 100-point threshold, there were many who had broken through the late 100-point threshold. A total of eight people made up 40% of the group. In fact, the ratio was very high. If only those who had broken through the late 100-point threshold participated, it meant that at least three people had no chance.
         Moreover, some of the cultivators in the middle stage of the 100th level also had their own thoughts.
        There was a difference in the level of breaking through 100, but the difference was not that big.
        There was no hope of a breakthrough 100 to challenge a breakthrough 100, but there were many people who had won against a breakthrough 100 to late stage.
        On the other hand, the chances of breaking through to the early 100-stage were not high. It was not just a little bit, but a lot worse. His inner strength was at least half of the late stage. Under normal circumstances, it was very difficult to have a chance to turn the tables.
        After Li Hao finished speaking, a total of 12 people stood up.
        Eight late-stage players chose to participate, and four mid-stage players also chose to challenge.
        Among them, Li Hao's demon-hunting team in the Silver City all chose to participate. Liu Yan was in the late stage, while Wu Chao and Chen Jian were in the middle stage.
        Li Hao recognized a few of the remaining nine.
        There was no need to mention Hong Qing, as well as her senior brother, Hong Hao. People from the inspection Office also participated. Li Heng, who had been named by Li Hao, also chose to participate. He was young, but he was already in the middle-stage of the 100th level.
        "Out of the 12, if I choose 5,7 will be eliminated ..."
        Li Hao took a look and said with a smile,"let's go one-on-one first." The 6 who lost will have one more chance to challenge each other. They can not challenge the same person. Whoever wins will replace the other person! "When it's all over, one of the remaining six will be eliminated ... When there are six of you left, I'll see how to eliminate you. Let's be more efficient. It's boring to fight in turns, it's a waste of time ..."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He had his own thoughts and didn't say anything.
        Looking at the 12 people in front of him, he reached out and grabbed a tree branch in the distance, instantly cutting it into 12 pieces.
        "Make your own choice. There are long and short 12-segments, but if there are two of them with the same length, they'll be your opponents. There will definitely be someone who will fight in the late stage against the mid stage. Don't think that you're at an advantage. It's all your own choice!"  The crowd did not say anything and went forward to draw lots.
        A moment later, the groups were out.
        "There's no need to fight separately," Li Hao said directly."The six groups will fight together and quickly decide the result!"
        Everyone looked at each other, but this place was huge, so it didn't matter.
        ……
        Li Hao didn't pay them any more attention and walked to the side with Liu Long. The others also dispersed, leaving some space for these people.
        In the arena, the 12 martial masters were still familiarizing themselves with each other and were not in a hurry to start.
        "Do you think ... Liu Yan and the others can become the team leaders?" Liu Long asked softly.
        "Sister Liu should be fine. She is very brutal, normal martial masters might not be able to defeat her. The swords gate disciples are not very experienced in life and death, and the inspection Office seems to have grown fatter. Brother Wang seems to be taking good care of them. They don't look as tough as they used to be, but more like slimy people."
        Liu Long nodded his head slightly. Indeed, he had also seen through it.
        He knew all of these people, but a few of them were indeed a little greasy now, and they didn't have the intrepid air they had in the Silver City.
        "As for brother Chao and brother Jian ... It's hard to say. Although they're experienced, they're not newbies. Martial masters more or less have some combat experience. After all, they're only in the intermediate stage."
        Moreover, it was the kind that had just entered, so it would not be easy to win.
         While they were talking, the six pairs of martial masters in the arena had already started fighting.
        The first to end the battle was not Liu Yan 's, but Hong Qing' s.
        Hong Qing wielded his long sword and struck out at an extremely fast speed. The opponent was a late-stage Martial Master from the inspection Office who had exceeded 100. In the end, he was sent flying by Hong Qing's sword in less than 10 seconds, and a bloody wound appeared on his body.
        Liu Long's brows furrowed upon seeing this!
        He was very familiar with this person. Back then, he had been his assistant and was stronger than Liu Yan. Now, he felt like he was living like a Prince. He could not even withstand 10 moves from Hong Qing, who had the strength of a late-stage 100-plus cultivator!
        Hong Qing's face was filled with joy. As soon as she finished, Liu Yan's twin blades had already pierced into her opponent's throat ... It was not deep, but it left a bloody mark on her opponent's throat. The swords gate Martial Master was so scared that his face turned pale.
        He was afraid that he would be killed by this woman.
        In the blink of an eye, both sides had ended, and the winners were both women.
        Moreover, both of their opponents were in the late stage of the 100th level.
        The opponents of the remaining four were all in the middle stage of the 100-odd realm. None of them had met each other. Clearly, Liu Long thought that Li Hao had cheated. Otherwise, it wouldn't be such a coincidence.
       
        After both sides finished fighting, a third person appeared. Hong Hao also sent Chen Jian flying with a sword strike. Chen Jian fell to the ground and couldn't get up. His face was a little depressed. He had wanted to rely on his defense to fight with this guy, but he lost very quickly.
        Liu Long also sighed and said softly,"The sword technique of the earth overturning sword is still very powerful. Although his disciples might not be very experienced, their foundations are very solid. This Hong Hao isn't weak either. He's not much weaker than me when I was in the late stage. The only difference is that his killing intent is slightly weaker ..."
        It was already very good!
        Liu Long had really killed his way up bit by bit.
        Li Hao nodded and continued to watch the battle.
        After the three battles ended, the fourth battle also ended quickly. If there was still a gap between the two martial masters, the battle would end quickly. Not long after, a chubby Martial Master from the swords gate knocked into a middle-stage Martial Master from the swords gate and won the spot.
        "Wang Chao, Wang Henggang's nephew. He also practices the iron cloth suit. It seems like he's doing well and has a solid foundation!" Liu Long said in a low voice.
        Li Hao nodded again. It was indeed not bad.
        He felt that he was much more powerful than Chen Jian.
         At this moment, there were only two battles left. One was between Wu Chao and a late-stage Martial Master from the inspection Office, and the other was between Li Heng and a late-stage Martial Master from swords gate.
        Wu Chao specialized in speed, and he dodged the attacks the entire time. This gave the Martial Master from the inspection Office a huge headache.
        If they could not hit the enemy, it would be difficult to end the battle quickly.
        Seeing that the other four parties had finished up and his side still hadn't caught Wu Chao, this person was also so anxious that he wanted to curse. He couldn't help but roar,""Skinny Wu, you're not done running, are you?"
        It was obvious that the two of them knew each other. Perhaps they were friends in the past. They were both from the blizzard Silver city's Inspection Office.
        "Cut the crap, you can talk to me after you catch me!"
        The two of them wandered around the arena. On the other side, Li Hao took a glance at Li Heng's battle. Li Heng was only in the middle stage of the hundred-plus level, but he was quite strong. Swords gate was good at sword arts, and Li Heng was also good at sword arts. His sword arts were light, not as sharp and heavy as swords gate 's, but rather similar to Shadowless Sword.
        Liu Long introduced again,"this is Li Heng. He used to be a member of the law enforcement team. He's quite talkative and young. He's 32 ... I think he's 33 this year. His swordsmanship has some history. There was a swordsman in the Silver City. At first, no one knew that he was a Martial Master. Later, by chance, he fought a few times. Li Heng was also chosen by the swordsman by chance and accepted to teach him some swordsmanship. After that, the swordsman died on a long journey. The White moon City informed us to collect his body. Only then did we know that the swordsman was actually the successor of the Willow silk sword ..."
        The catkin sword was given to one of the Seven Swords. However, if the ten swords of the Silver Moon had been ranked back then, the catkin sword would have been famous.
        To be able to rank in the top ten of the Silver Moon martial forest's swordsmanship at its most glorious time, he was already a ruthless person. The opponent's second generation disciple would not be too weak either. Although Li Heng was in the middle of the 100th level and was facing a disciple of the earth overturning sword, his Willow silk sword was able to beat the opponent until he was unable to counterattack.
        The earth overturning sword was definitely not weak!  However, even if it was the same sword technique, the effect of everyone's practice was different. After a stalemate for a few minutes, the opponent's wrist was still pierced by Li Heng's sword, and the long sword in his hand was sent flying. This was the first person in the middle of the 100th level to defeat his opponent.
        Li Heng was also panting heavily, but he was smiling brightly.
        When they were done here, Wu Chao was still running laps with the Martial Master from the inspection Office.
        Li Hao was also speechless!
        For the first time, he felt that being fast was actually quite annoying. The other party had already finished, but had the two of them even started fighting?
        Wu Chao ran until his tongue was almost sticking out, but this person could indeed run.
        The late-stage Martial Master was panting from all the running.
        He couldn't catch up with the other party, but once he stopped, the other party would launch a sneak attack from time to time, making him tired of dealing with it.
        After a long time, the late-stage Martial Master was furious.""I'm done!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "You admit defeat?"
         "I won't admit defeat, but I'm not fighting anymore. Wu, even if you advance, there are still six people left. One more has to be eliminated ... You may run fast, but there will always be someone faster than you!"
        He cursed and immediately stopped fighting. His speed was much slower than the other party, and he couldn't catch up no matter what. What was the point of fighting?
        Wu Chao was overjoyed. As for being challenged later, he was prepared and just had to continue running.
        Being fast was not something to be ashamed of.
        At this point, the six of them had defeated their opponents and all of them had advanced.
        At this moment, the six eliminated martial masters were all staring at Li Heng and Wu Chao. These two were the weakest, but unfortunately, they only had one chance to choose. If they were all chosen, then only one of them could fight. For a moment, the martial masters were in a dilemma. What should they do if they were all chosen?
        As for Hong Qing, Liu Yan, and Hong Hao, no one wanted to choose them. Wang Henggang's nephew, Wang Chao, had a strong tie Buyi and a difficult defense to break through. Everyone did not think that he could win easily. On the other hand, the two in the middle stage of the 100-plus cultivation realm became the soft persimmons.
        Li Hao looked at the six people who had lost and said with a smile,""It looks like everyone is only going to challenge Wu Chao and Li Heng. The other four will definitely advance to the next round ... Forget about those who were defeated by the two of them, let's not waste any more time. If you can't even win against the mid-stage, there's no point in challenging them. "The remaining four, you can spar with each other. Whoever wins can choose one to fight. It'll be fair if you fight one more round. You can only blame yourselves for losing earlier!"
        Still, no one had any objections. As for the remaining four, they didn't fight either because Wu Chao and the other mid-stage had given up on the opportunity. The two of them had only been giving it a try previously. They had lost too quickly just now, so there was no point in fighting a few more rounds.
