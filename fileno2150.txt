"This ..."Would he?No one knew.​ However, Li Hao's ostentatiousness might be to force them to leave the West and then defeat them one by one.……These people quickly began to discuss countermeasures.Li Hao continued to release his sword intent.It didn't matter if anyone had escaped in advance. In any case, there was a high probability that Ying Hongyue and the Queen of the West wouldn't escape. That was enough. Those guys might even be overthinking it and worry that he was only forcing them to leave and defeating them one by one.In fact ... Li Hao didn't arrange for anyone to stand guard.There was no need for that.It was a waste of time and energy.It would be good to make them suspicious. The smarter they were, the more they would not dare to leave. The dumber they were, the better they would run. And the dumbasses who ran away were actually nothing to worry about, and the smart ones ... Would only think that he was scheming against them.It was better to move than to stay still!If he moved, some of the things in the dark would surface.Perhaps I don't need to do it myself. Ying Hongyue will help me deal with some people, such as Hongyue's side and Zheng Yu's side. That guy might also be thinking about these people.The sword essence continued to spread in all directions.Broken fragments of the starry sky sword suddenly appeared and scattered in all directions.Li Hao didn't hide his tracks and walked out openly.In his heart, he was thinking about other things.The power of faith ... Gods ... The great Dao universe ...At that moment, he put himself in li daoheng's shoes. If this person walked out of sword city and came to the West, what would he do?What was he after?Why did these people betray venerable the sword and neo martial arts in the past?Strength?The great Dao?Or something else?If it was for the sake of improving one's strength, for the sake of the great Dao ... Everything one did would be for the sake of improving themselves."He didn't show his face. Perhaps he's looking for an opportunity to strengthen himself. In the West, there are gods and the power of belief. There's even a chance to communicate with the great path universe, but the other party shouldn't have been able to enter the great path universe before ... How can he use the power of belief to strengthen himself?A Dao Meridian?Faith?How to make people believe in him?As this thought flashed through Li Hao's mind, he suddenly appeared in a temple and grabbed a priest. The priest's expression changed greatly.Li Hao's eyes were a little illusionary as he said softly,""Is there a sword God in the West?"A God!It absorbed the power of faith!The priest was at a loss, and his eyes gradually became cloudy as he muttered,""Sword God? No... No sword God ..."  Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  There was no sword God in the West.There had never been one since ancient times. Even if there was one ... When venerable the sword came here, there was no one else. Who dared to call themselves sword God in front of venerable the sword?Li Hao frowned slightly. Was his speculation wrong?According to his plan, if the Li family wanted to sense the power of the great path and absorb the power of faith, it would be best to impersonate the sword God if there was a sword God. In his place, he could use the body of the sword God to absorb the power of faith from the West.Unknowingly, they would be able to enter the Western system and even the great Dao universe.But ... There was no sword God in the West."Did I misjudge?"Li Hao frowned slightly. This was the result of his choice when he put himself in the other party's identity. If the West had a sword God, he would replace him and make the billions of Western creatures believe in him."It's actually not here ..."He looked at the power of faith that filled the air between heaven and earth, and his heart stirred."Black Panther, let's go and find the gods!"Heibao was confused by him. He didn't look for her just now, and now he was looking for her?What are you doing!You've been exposed!Li Hao didn't say anything. The Black Panther had no choice but to Twitch its nose and quickly teleport away. Li Hao quickly followed, constantly grabbing the power of faith in the air.It was very messy!There were all kinds of power of belief, which were also the power of the great Dao. The Western gods were indeed blessed by the heavens, but these gods didn't know much about the great Dao, so they had wasted many opportunities.Otherwise, if they had known about the great path universe earlier, these gods might have unified the world a long time ago.……On the other side.In a temple, the man who had sensed the sword intent earlier looked up at the sky again and frowned. Li Hao's sword intent seemed to have other intentions.Was it related to him?Or was he just here to deal with yueshen and the others?This young man ... He was a little unpredictable.……On the other side.At this moment, the four sides gathered. The red robes, the black robes, the three major organizations, and the Queen's side.The moon goddess's expression was cold as she looked at the experts from the three sides. In the end, she looked at Ying Hongyue, and her expression was a little unsightly."Li Hao is here!""I know,"Ying Hongyue nodded. She looked at the sword intent that filled the entire West and seemed to be deep in thought. She then said, "Don't worry too much. Even if he really comes, he wouldn't dare to rashly deal with Her Majesty. If he really did ... Perhaps Her Majesty would have lost her life the last time.""Hmph!"The Queen snorted coldly, and her expression became even colder. She then looked at the red-robed people, and her expression was extremely cold."You guys have been following this King. Do you think you can kill this King?"The red-robed side was silent.Ying Hongyue interjected,"Your Majesty, now is not the time to look into this. Our top priority now is not to target each other. Instead, we have to think of a way to suppress Li Hao. We have to deal with Li Hao!""You have a way?"The Queen seemed to look down on him.""You've been fighting with Li Hao until now, but you didn't seem to have done anything other than killing his parents and friends. From the time he was weak until now ... It's all because you've raised a Tiger that will bring you trouble!"

Chapter 2151 The Silver Moon In The Sky_4
Ying Hongyue felt a little helpless and chuckled."Sometimes, it's heaven's will ... Li Hao was born in accordance with heaven's will, so it's very difficult to kill him! He was 21 years old, and 21 years ago, the world was awaked...21 years ago, the will of the heavens was birthed...21 years ago, the moon was high in the sky, and the Queen, who had inherited the spirit of the moon god, also began to awaken ..."These words caused the Queen to be slightly startled. She looked at Ying Hongyue."What do you mean?"Ying Hongyue sighed and said,"do you still not understand?" He was born from the will of heaven and earth, and the moment the will of heaven was born, Li Hao was born. He had the bloodline of the Li family, wielded the starry sky sword, and was in the Silver City ... He was actually the son of fate born from the struggle between various parties, just like the new martial heavenly Emperor in the past. The red moon's venerable sovereigns, the main cities, the divine Spirit Dao meridians, and the great path universe all erupted with glory at that time. Under the balance, Li Hao was born ..."The Queen sneered."In that case, I, a God, should be blessed by heaven and earth. It's not Li Hao's turn to be blessed!"This Ying Hongyue couldn't win against Li Hao, so she blamed everything on heaven's will.What a joke!As for Ying Hongyue, she shrugged her shoulders slightly, smiled, and didn't say anything else.That was the truth! He couldn't do anything about whether he believed it or not, but he knew that Li Hao was the product of the compromise between heaven and earth at that time. All parties hoped for recovery and fought for it, but Li Hao was eventually successful.Li Hao had reached this level in such a short time. He was too talented, and this kind of talent ... Was the result of the whole world.Of course, fate was hard to grasp.All of this was just his speculation.However, he believed that it was most likely the case. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to discover the great Dao universe so easily.He didn't say anything else and quickly said,""Let's not bother about that. The most important thing now is that we're working together. I want to do a few things ... First, resurrect some of the gods who haven't completely died! Second, the Crimson Moon universe, the godly spirit, and I can join forces and release some of the power of the Silver Moon and some of the Crimson Moon to strengthen us and his Majesty!""Senior red dust, you should still be in the vicinity of the Silver Moon, right?" he asked.A black-robed figure was silent for a moment before nodding.""Yes,""Then, senior red dust ... Can you strengthen the seal? our current enemy is Li Hao! The moon goddesses are worried that the power of the Silver Moon will leak out and the seal will weaken. The Crimson Moon's Overlord is worried that the Crimson Moon's power will leak out and weaken himself. Lord Hong Chen is worried that the seal will be unstable ... Everyone is a little afraid of each other ... And it's because of this that Li Hao has a chance!""Since we've come together this time, I hope that we can be honest with each other, put aside our prejudices, and cooperate with each other. We can also use this opportunity to deal Li Hao a heavy blow, or even kill him!""We can't make the decision!"The two sides could not make a decision. "The communication system is under Li Hao's control," black robe said."We can't send a message back. You won't be able to get any news unless we go back now ..."That would take too long.Ying Hongyue smiled."Among the three of us, except for the gods, we all have the power of the Crimson Moon. The neo martial arts communication system is indeed under Li Hao's control, but we can still contact some of them through the power of the Crimson Moon ... As long as we are sincere, we can cooperate.""Of course, I know what you're worried about ... You're worried that the moon goddesses and I will be the powerful ones, and you won't get anything out of it ... But we're powerful because we want to deal with Li Hao. Li Hao's death will be the greatest gain!"A red-robed man laughed eerily,"leader Ying, no matter what you say, you're only gathering here to help yourself!" You've been running away from Li Hao since the beginning. How do you expect us to believe that you'll deal with Li Hao after you gain power, and not run away again after you gain power?"It was obvious that Ying Hongyue's reputation had been damaged.Ying Hongyue wasn't in a hurry. She said softly,"At this point, if Li Hao doesn't die, I'll be in more trouble than you! I only fled because I wasn't strong enough. If I was strong enough, why would I need to flee?""In addition ... I also hope that venerable Red Moon sovereign and red dust leader can launch a surprise attack. Those who remain in the ancient city are no longer safe. Why don't we seize the ancient city now and put more pressure on Li Hao so that his people won't have time to worry about anything else?""I've been waiting ... The second recovery is still far away!"Ying Hongyue was silent for a moment before she said,"as a price and in exchange, I can activate some of my arrangements to stir up the forbidden Sea and release some of the forbidden sea's energy to speed up the pace of the second recovery!" I'm confident that the two leaders will agree!"The two sides fell into deep thought.The Queen did not say a word.If she could release a part of the Silver Moon's power and revive some gods, she could strengthen the divine Kingdom. She didn't care about how the other sides would make arrangements or compromise. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If the four sides really cooperated, there would still be great benefits.It was just that all parties were afraid of each other and worried that problems would arise, so they had not been able to come to an agreement.It was good that Li Hao had shown up now. He could give them a chance to lower their guard and complete their cooperation."Let's give it a try. Otherwise, we won't have a chance anymore!"Ying Hongyue said after seeing this.The two sides thought for a moment, and soon, someone said,""Let's try to contact him, but whether we can succeed ... We can't be sure! There's one more thing. If we really succeed, I hope that leader Ying will keep his promise ..."

Chapter 2152 The Silver Moon In The Sky (3 In 1)
Of course, this was just a saying.Whether they would defend or not, it would still be up to Ying Hongyue.Ying Hongyue nodded and didn't say anything else.Both parties began to try to contact each other. As for whether they would contact the red moon Emperor or other powerful figures of the red moon world in this world, no one knew.……At this moment, Li Hao was approaching them.Very quickly, the Black Panther wanted to continue moving forward, but Li Hao stopped. He could vaguely sense the presence of some people ahead, and even the presence of some Crimson Moon Power.Li Hao stopped in his tracks.He stopped in his tracks and thought for a moment. Then, he sent a message through his armor and asked,""Is Qian Wuliang here?""Yes, Lord Marquis!""Go to the Silver City. You don't have to get too close. Check the air with director Zhao and see if there are any fluctuations in the seal! "Also, I want all the information on the gods in Scandinavia. Director Qi and the others have previously studied gods and have some understanding of them. I want all the information! All the names and abilities of the gods. "Director Qi's voice slowly emerged,"Alright, I'll sort it out and pass it on to Your Highness as soon as possible. However ... While we do have some understanding of the gods, it's not everything ...""It's fine!"Li Hao didn't mind. After thinking for a while, he said,""Is the ninth master here?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Yes,""Give me all the information about li daoheng...And the other important people in sword city. Including their names, appearances, personalities, and some other important information."The ninth master was silent for a while. After a while, he said,""Okay ... But I don't know them all.""Well, just give it to me. I'll make my own judgment.""Alright," he said.The few of them didn't say anything more and went to prepare the materials.As for Li Hao, he looked around and glanced at the Western Region before suddenly disappearing and reappearing in the bright star sector.At this moment, he quickly walked to the Galaxy area and took a look. He memorized the brightness and strength of all the stars and looked at the Dark Universe in the distance. He had not finished exploring all of them.The Dao meridians of some deities might still be in the depths of the universe.The word "Dao" appeared and quickly enlarged. It almost covered the entire area of the Galaxy and gave off a faint light. In this way, once a God was powerful, he had a good chance of finding their hidden Natal star.The premise was that he was in his own Galaxy.At the very least, he knew that there was a planet in the fleshly body Dao region that belonged to the moon goddess. However ... That planet was dispensable to the moon goddess. She had countless Dao meridians, but none of them had ever opened this one.However, Li Hao still locked onto the star. Although the other party wouldn't be affected if the star was destroyed, as long as the star was there, the moon goddess couldn't escape his lock. As for this star, he could also make some comparisons and make some judgments. If yueshen became stronger, this star might also change.After doing all this, Li Hao left the bright star sector.…… At the same time, in the distance, the four sides gathered. Not long after, the other two sides sent back news."The Lord has agreed!""The venerable sovereign has agreed!"Both sides gave their answers.Ying Hongyue was overjoyed!It was difficult to get Zheng Yu and venerable Red Moon Emperor to agree. However, under Li Hao's pressure, both sides agreed.This was a good thing!Zheng Yu was worried that the seal would break. Hongyue's venerable sovereign was also worried that Ying Hongyue would absorb too much power, causing him to be weak and the seal to become stronger.Now, the two sides had reached a compromise, which gave him an advantage.Li Hao had finally done a good thing!"There's no time to waste!"Ying Hongyue quickly said,"then let's do it. Let's release some Silver Moon Power first and make her Majesty the moon goddess stronger. Gods aren't restricted by heaven and earth. Now that Li Hao has become a saint-level master, the moon goddess might be able to do the same!""Li Hao might think that we're going to kill each other ... But he's underestimating us. I hope your Majesty ... Can understand!"He looked at yueshen helplessly, hoping that this woman would not choose to kill each other just because she was stronger.It would be very troublesome!Yueshen glanced at him coldly and did not bother to say anything.""When do I release the Silver Moon Power?""Very soon!"Someone from the red-robed side said in a deep voice,"the moon god can extract the power of the Silver Moon. The venerable sovereign will release some power of the red moon at the same time to achieve a balance. There is no need to worry!"He would be lying if he said he wasn't worried.In fact, everyone was afraid that the venerable sovereign would break out of the seal, but at this moment, they could only try.Yueshen did not hold back and quickly sat down cross-legged, her body faintly discernible. At this moment, the sky was already dark, and a slightly Red Moon appeared in the sky. At this moment, it suddenly exuded a faint silver light.The silver light shone on yueshen's body, and her aura started to strengthen.At the same time, on the moon, a faint red light gradually faded away. Nine light pillars suddenly appeared on Ying Hongyue's body. Eight of them combined into one, and the remaining one, which was originally extremely weak, began to strengthen at this moment.This scene caused some of the red robes to change their expressions.The power of the red moon in Ying Hongyue's body had actually dissipated a lot!Where did this guy put the Crimson Moon's power?……At the same time, Li Hao also sensed it. Although they couldn't see the seal above the Silver City clearly, they all said that the fluctuations above the Silver City were very strong.

Chapter 2153 The Silver Moon In The Sky (6)
And below the Silver City, Hurricane city might be right where it was. A surge of qi and blood energy emerged, strengthening the seal.That was Zheng Yu stabilizing the seal!Qian Wuliang quickly sent a message."Lord Marquis, something is wrong. The power of the Crimson Moon is spreading out. It seems that the seal of Hurricane city is being stabilized. Should we go up and destroy it ...""No need!"Li Hao smiled. This was what he had been waiting for.Of course, this would put him in more danger.But ... Who would care?Li Hao thought for a while and said, keep an eye on the ancient cities! Even a rabbit would bite when it was in a hurry. Besides, they were not rabbits! We're going to take over all the ancient cities, and they know that if there's any strange movement ... They'll wait and see!""Understood!"Li Hao didn't say anything more. At this moment, he also made his move. His sword intent became even thicker, spreading in the direction he had sensed earlier.Perhaps they sensed all this, or perhaps they felt that Li Hao was coming, but powerful auras quickly surged over, and a large amount of power of faith spread over. Li Hao stopped and silently sensed the power of faith in the air.The power of faith was being extracted, but there was still a lot that remained unmoving.Some of them belonged to dead gods, and they were in a state of overflow. Some were not extracted by anyone and had been stagnant. Perhaps they had not recovered, or perhaps ... They did not dare to extract.Li Hao's eyes flickered.He caught some power of faith and carefully examined it. He looked around and suddenly smiled.Li daoheng?If you were here ... Perhaps, I would be able to find you this time!As for whether the other party is good or bad, it has nothing to do with me.I only know that you've been hiding ... You're not good people.The moon goddess was an idiot. The other party had actually infiltrated the Holy Kingdom to such an extent. If she had not killed many gods, the other party would have hidden even deeper.However, Li Hao soon frowned.The unmoving power of faith suddenly flowed toward the area where the moon goddesses were. Li Hao's expression changed as he mumbled,""The moon goddesses extracted it ... No... No..."He shook his head, a hint of doubt in his eyes.The next moment, Li Hao's expression changed when he saw the Silver Moon in the sky.Suddenly, he rose into the air and flew straight into the sky.The Silver Moon was in the world barrier and was sealed. It could be seen but not seen, and did not exist in the real world.So, even if you could see the moon, you couldn't actually touch it.As time passed, the powerhouses all understood this principle and no longer cared about the Silver Moon that could be seen everywhere.Therefore, even if Li Hao knew about this, he wouldn't fly into the sky to find the non-existent moon for nothing. But at this moment, he quickly rose into the sky and kept rising.One kilometer, two kilometers, three kilometers ...Heaven and earth seemed to be limitless.The moon could never be touched.After an unknown period of time, Li Hao stopped and looked into the distance where a bright moon was hanging!Li Hao's expression changed again and again, and he stopped moving forward.He watched for a while and left quickly.A while after he left, a figure suddenly flickered on the moon. Looking down, he saw a man with a long sword on his back. The man's expression was grave. It was ... Li Hao?……Li Hao's expression changed, and he quickly fled in shock."Good move!"The ruins were all underground.This was the consensus of everyone.The ruins were all hidden and did not dare to appear.However, what if someone had turned the ruins into a fake moon?What if the ruins were hung high up in the sky so that everyone could see it? What if everyone knew that the moon was within the world barrier and no one could touch it?What if no one would keep flying into the sky to chase after the non-existent moon?The great hidden in the city!Darkness under the light?Or perhaps, the technique was so advanced that even the moon goddess Queen thought that the moon in the sky was just a projection from the Silver Moon?He had never thought about this before. However, today, from the probing of the power of faith, he seemed to have discovered the other party's hiding place. This ... Was too powerful!"They've always been sealed. How did they get out? Or could it be ... That it has already come out and is not in the seal at all?"Countless thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind.Could one person do it?To deceive the entire world!Even Zheng Yu of the Zheng family and Hong Yue, the venerable sovereign, had been played in the palm of his hand. Could this be done by one person?At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat excited.The moon in the sky was still shining brightly.Yueshen, who was still cultivating below, was also clueless. She did not think that there was any problem.……In the air.Above the bright moon, a shrine stood.Within the moon god Hall, a statue appeared. It was none other than ... The moon goddess from the moon god Hall.At this moment, a man appeared below the statue. He carried a long sword on his back and frowned slightly.After a long time, he said softly, Li Hao came from the sky. Did he discover anything?For a long time, there was no sound.After an unknown period of time, the statue in the temple suddenly came to life. It opened its eyes and said,""What can he find?"The man with the long sword on his back said softly,""Maybe ... He found out about us?""I won 't,"  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  "Are you sure?""I'm not sure ... But what reason or judgment does he have to be so sure that we're here?""Something's not right today ..." The man with the long sword said softly," "He's suffused with sword intent. No matter how strong the others are, he's been waiting. I suspect that he came to the West this time to find us.""Maybe. So what if they found out?"“……”The man with the long sword did not say anything else. He looked down at the world and fell into deep thought.After a long time, he suddenly said,"yueshen, has the will of the heavens matured?" When can it be captured?""I'm still lacking. ""As soon as possible!""I will,"“……”The conversation between the two ended just like that. However, the way the man with the long sword addressed her was shocking.At this moment, no one could hear him.Otherwise, they would be shocked. Wasn't the Queen the moon god?……The Queen, who was still cultivating below, was completely unaware of all this. She only knew that her strength was constantly growing and was extremely excited.She might be on The Holy Road!Li Hao, even if you become a saint, this King will not fear you!The world only knew that Li Hao was young, but they didn't know that the moon goddess, the Queen of the West, was also born 21 years ago. She wasn't older than Li Hao, and she was about to recover her saintly strength!

2154 Chapter 363
Li Hao quickly descended from the sky.Countless thoughts appeared in his mind.A fake silver Moon!The moon was actually fake. Who would dare to believe it?Not only that, but this moon was also extracting the power of faith from the divine Kingdom, which was also a type of power of the great Dao. The other party might have been studying the great Dao universe all along, but because he was not a cultivator of the Dao Meridian, he could not get the hang of it ..."Something's wrong!"Li Hao was shocked. No, something was definitely wrong. They had only known about the Dao Meridian for a short time.However, the other party had been studying faith.Without a Dao Meridian and being a God, how could the Li clan absorb the power of faith?"That's not right ... Even if the Li clan impersonated a God and gained faith, they wouldn't be able to absorb it without a Dao Meridian ... That means ...""The other party has a Dao Meridian?"Li Hao was shocked. The other party had a deity and a Dao Meridian, and he should have some understanding of the Dao Meridian.A deity?He once again looked up into the air and thought back to the time when the moon goddess Queen had been cultivating, and the power of faith that had been stagnant suddenly started to move ...Li Hao shook his head in a daze.There must be a connection!Also, how could he impersonate the moon without being discovered?The moon seemed real.Li Hao hit his head hard. Why did this happen?Where did the deviation come from?The moon, the divine Spirit, the Dao Meridian, the great Dao, the Li clan ...Why did he suddenly feel that everything was so complicated?It was not as simple as he had imagined!Were Zheng Yu and his group, the red moon Emperor, really the biggest threat to the entire Silver Moon?Lu Li's eyes flickered as he quickly flew into the distance. Yueshen was still cultivating over there. He could already sense that some Immortals were cultivating, and their strength was also increasing.Not only that, but in the great path universe, some stars were also trembling. This meant that the Natal star of a deity had appeared.Li Hao quickly moved forward.There were some things that he didn't quite understand and couldn't understand. Now, perhaps only these gods could clear his doubts.……The auras of Ying Hongyue and the others were getting stronger and stronger.At this moment, Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. An aura fluctuated in her body, and her expression changed slightly. "Let's go, Li Hao is here!"Everyone was shocked.Is Li Hao here? He did not dare to hesitate. Although he and the moon goddess had made great progress, they might not be able to defeat Li Hao, who had reached the Dao integration level. Without saying anything, they quickly got up and fled in one direction.Li Hao was the real villain in their eyes.At this moment, Li Hao's figure appeared behind them. He looked forward and said,""Ying Hongyue, Your Majesty the Queen, I won't kill you so easily. Why do you need to worry? We haven't seen each other for a long time, isn't it good to have a chat?"No one cared.The group of people quickly fled.On the three major organizations 'side, the weak cultivators could only be placed in a divine weapon and escape with the others. There were more than ten red-robed and black-robed cultivators beside them.Almost all of them had the power of immortality, but they could only flee when they encountered Li Hao."Ying Hongyue ... I really want to talk to you. Are you that unwilling?" In front of him, Ying Hongyue was as graceful as ever. However, she was missing a fan in her hand, and she lacked some of her usual carefreeness.At this moment, he stepped through the void and chuckled,""Li Hao, I'd be happy to chat ... But it's fine if we talk face to face! If you don't mind, open up our communication system and I don't mind chatting with you for a while!"Then, they attacked at the same time, shaking and shattering the space to stop Li Hao.Ying Hongyue's voice rose again,"Li Hao, we aren't your greatest enemy. Even if you chase us all the way, are you sure you can eat us?" If you're injured and someone else takes advantage of you, that won't be good!"At this moment, the Queen also snorted coldly,""Li Hao, this is the divine Kingdom region!"In other words, she could use more powerful combat power here.The void was filled with the power of faith.If she hadn't completely digested the Silver Moon Power, she wouldn't have run away. Instead, she would have stayed to deal with Li Hao.The first time she met Li Hao, she had easily defeated him."You're really disobedient!"Behind them, Li Hao sighed and suddenly disappeared.Not only did they not feel at ease, but they also became more nervous. They quickened their pace and quickly fled.At this moment, a God suddenly screamed.There weren't many gods left with the Queen. At this time, a powerful God screamed, and the next moment, his divine power scattered.Upon seeing this, the Queen instantly understood.In the next moment, he was extremely furious and roared,""Li Hao, you dare!"Li Hao had entered the bright star realm and shattered the Natal star of a God.As for gods, almost all of them had their own path and enjoyed it alone.Unlike other humans, there was only one deity. If one deity was destroyed, even if one didn't die, one's strength would be lost.At this moment, Ying Hongyue also frowned slightly.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Li Hao, who could freely enter and exit the great path universe, was too troublesome.The flying sword immortal and the heavenly Mountain Lord beside him couldn't help but frown, feeling a little uneasy. They had also cultivated a new Dao, and now it was an obstacle. Could Li Hao also kill their Natal stars?The Queen's aura grew stronger and stronger, and she was furious!Back then, the Western divine Kingdom had a bunch of deities. But now, there were only a few deities following her. And now, another star had shattered, causing his aura to be in disarray. If this continued, the deities of the Western divine Kingdom would be completely removed from the stage.

2155 Chapter 363
She was extremely furious!He wanted to stay and fight with that demon.She was much stronger than before, and Ying Hongyue wasn't weak either. In addition, there were more than twenty undying fighters from Hongyue and the Zheng family. With such combat power, did they really need to fear Li Hao?No matter how strong he was, he had just entered the divine path.A group of undyings...They could pile him to death!"Ying Hongyue ... Let's join forces and kill him!"The Queen was furious. She was worried that the remaining gods would also meet with misfortune.Ying Hongyue frowned slightly, and the Queen became even angrier."Do you do this every time you meet him? No wonder you've been defeated again and again!"Ying Hongyue shook her head and sighed.Soon, he smiled again,"if the Queen wants to try ... It's not impossible!" It's just that ... I'm worried that we'll have to pay an even greater price. ""Hmph! Even so, he can't just run away without fighting. There are dozens of experts, why would they be afraid of him?"At this moment, she felt that she would be able to enter The Holy Road if she absorbed some more Silver Moon Power.Even if he wasn't as good as Li Hao, the difference wasn't big.With so many undyings around, why would they need to worry about Li Hao?The black-robed and red-robed experts beside him were also a little hesitant, but they were also eager to try ... Were they really no match for Li Hao?They were all old qualified undying beings!After a short moment, Ying Hongyue stopped.The Queen was determined to stay and fight Li Hao. The other elders also had their own thoughts. If they continued to run, they would probably lose their support.He didn't like this combination.People's hearts were not United.Everyone had their own thoughts.Unfortunately, he had no other choice. Everyone had just fused, and he could not win over everyone's hearts so quickly.Even someone as powerful as Li Hao, who was extremely talented, had to take things step by step to win over the hearts of the neo martial artists. Only when he had completely killed a Saint did he manage to convince the people of heaven battling city.One could only imagine how difficult it was to win the hearts of people.……A moment later, Li Hao arrived.On the opposite side, dozens of powerhouses stood in the air, vaguely forming a formation.Almost all of them had undying energy.Very strong!Li Hao didn't go forward immediately. He stopped in the distance and sensed the power of faith in the void. At this moment, the power of faith was gathering. Li Hao frowned.He then looked at the moon goddess, who was looking at Li Hao coldly."I have a question," Li Hao suddenly said."Can you answer it?"“……” Everyone was stunned when he suddenly said this in the face of a great battle.Yueshen looked at him coldly and said,"what are you up to now?" Li Hao, since we're not leaving, we dare to fight you! Are you afraid?"  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  "Shut up!""Wait for me to finish!" Li Hao scolded, frowning.He frowned and said,'I'll just ask one thing. Do deities ... Have many Dao meridians?' Or did he only have one Dao Meridian? I've studied the corpses of many gods, and there's only one Dao Meridian, no extra Dao meridians ..."The Queen was furious!As for the remaining three gods, their faces also darkened. To study the corpses of many gods ... That was infuriating.Ying Hongyue's eyes flickered for a moment. She laughed softly and said,"According to your so-called new Dao, the bright star Dao, there is indeed only one God-level innate Dao Meridian.""Is the moon goddess the same?"p The Queen sneered,"you want to kill me?" That was impossible! My Dao Meridian is not in your so-called universe of the great path, but outside ... Do you see it? The Silver Moon is my Dao!"The Silver Moon in the void was her Dao.The Dao Meridian could not enter the great path universe, which showed how special it was.Li Hao calculated silently. No, you have a Dao Meridian, and a physical Dao Meridian at that. It was yours when I first found it, but it was not activated or cultivated. It was hidden.Therefore, your Dao Meridian is still in the universe of the great path."And you have more than one Dao Meridian!However, gods were born and nurtured by the earth, and they only had one Dao Meridian. This was not right!A God with multiple Dao meridians ... Could it still be considered born from nature?Of course, this was the second generation Moon Goddess, so she might be a little special. She might also have the Dao Meridian that others had.But ... Was it like this?On the other side, the dozens of powerhouses didn't take the initiative to attack. They were just waiting passively, but Li Hao stopped.He looked at Ying Hongyue and then at the Queen.Finally, he looked at the great beings from Hurricane city and the Crimson Moon cosmos. The Crimson Moon Power on these people was very dense. Were the great beings from the Crimson Moon cosmos from the Crimson Moon cosmos or were they neo martial great beings that were converted from too much Crimson Moon Power?Li Hao didn't have an absolute answer yet.The Queen seemed to be getting impatient. She snorted, and the power of the Silver Moon emanated from her body. Suddenly, she attacked Li Hao with her palm!If the others didn't dare to, she would fight Li Hao first!This would also allow everyone to clearly see how strong Li Hao was.Could he really fight against dozens of undyings?Li Hao retreated, allowing the palm print to hit him. It shattered the void and even landed on his body instantly, leaving a mark with a bang. The Queen was stunned, and so were the others.The Queen's combat strength was at the eighth or ninth level of the sun Moon realm, which was not considered weak.But ... Hadn't li Hao reached the Dao integration realm?How could he be so easily hit by his opponent's palm?At this moment, Li Hao gently touched his injured area, grabbed some of the remaining Silver Moon force, and sniffed it. His posture ... Made the Queen's eyelids tremble. This Li Hao is crazy!

Chapter 2156 Silver Moon's Scheme (3)
A lecherous demon!Thinking back to the day she fought with Li Hao and was touched all over by Li Hao, she became even angrier. Gritting her teeth, she said,""Li Hao, you're the leader of the Heavenly Star. How can you be so shameless? it's disgusting!"Ying Hongyue, on the other hand, looked pensive as she glanced at Li Hao.As for Li Hao, he sniffed and felt it carefully. Then, he smiled and said softly,""Your Majesty, may I ask how old you are?""Bastard!"BOOM!The Queen was furious. A scepter appeared in her hand, and she swung it at Li Hao. The Silver Moon Power became even more intense. Power of faith gathered around her. At this moment, she even unleashed the ultimate power below the Saint path.Even some peak immortal realm experts would be shocked by such power.At this moment, billions of people seemed to be praying in all directions. In an instant, the sound of prayers reverberated in the divine Kingdom, shaking the world. It seemed that billions of people had joined hands to kill Li Hao!The power of faith!At the same time, the others were also tempted. Li Hao ... Didn't seem that powerful.The Queen alone had the intention of suppressing the other party.Even if he couldn 't, the difference wasn't big.Since that was the case ... Perhaps they could really keep Li Hao."Let's attack together and kill this bastard here and now!"The Queen shouted angrily.In an instant, someone rushed out.Everyone was a little excited.This Li Hao ... Had really come alone, and his battle prowess didn't seem to be that great. In that case ... Perhaps he could really kill him here today.Before this, this person appeared to be extremely powerful, and everyone was a little afraid.He didn't expect that it was just a fake!Even Ying Hongyue was frowning. Li Hao was like this?It was impossible!If that was the case, where did Li Hao get the courage to come alone and hunt down the experts?Even though he was extremely puzzled.However, Ying Hongyue couldn't just stand by and watch when she saw the others charge out. She instantly disappeared and quickly appeared beside the Queen. She also threw a punch, and her battle prowess wasn't weak.Li Hao was surrounded in an instant.Behind him, the Black Panther was on high alert. Its eyes were filled with ferocity, but its battle power was only at the level of someone who had just entered the undying realm. Anyone here might be able to match it. It could only wait for the right time to deal a fatal blow to one of them.As for Li Hao, he didn't use his sword either. He just kept fighting with the Queen, and the more he fought, the more excited the Queen became.It was as if he had returned to the first time when he had suppressed Li Hao.At that time, she could completely suppress Li Hao.If not for the thunderous attack from the ninth Division commander's clone, she might have been able to kill Li Hao in that battle.All the attacks came from all directions.The powerful energy shattered the void, causing it to fall into chaos.The undying experts were all extremely excited.Li Hao, on the other hand, simply allowed them to attack him. Soon, bloody wounds were left on his body.Seeing that they were about to completely surround and kill Li Hao, everyone became even more excited. At this moment, Li Hao's expression suddenly changed. He looked at the Queen and suddenly said,""You're not right ..."The Queen was stunned.He cursed in his heart!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  You're at death's door, yet you still want to play tricks!You're looking for death!Li Hao's eyes were no longer filled with mockery. He suddenly looked up at the sky. At this moment, he seemed to have come to a realization. He looked at the Queen. This person ... Was human!Deceive the heavens!Li Hao's expression was solemn. Ying Hongyue sensed that something was wrong and was just about to retreat when sword energy suddenly swept across the world from Li Hao's body. He shouted,"Slash!"A sword pierced through the world!This sword was more than ten times stronger than the previous one!Seizing this opportunity, the Black Panther charged out.Everyone was shocked. Before they could digest it, the void suddenly shattered. In an instant, another sword slashed through the sky. It was the ninth master!That's right, the ninth Division commander from heaven battling city.Everyone was shocked!Not only that, but at this moment, general Huai's tens of thousands of branches pierced through the heavens and earth. Several golden-armored powerhouses also struck out from the void at the same time. The fearsome fey plants attacked one after another!BOOM!At this moment, heaven and earth seemed to be completely shattered. The sky cracked and the earth was torn apart."Ah!"Screams of pain reverberated through the air as the experts wailed in pain.Li Hao's face was expressionless. He simply slashed at two people, one being the Queen and the other being Ying Hongyue.As for the others ... What were they thinking?Where I am, is where heaven battling city is.What alone?He was too lazy to waste his energy on killing these guys.The two saints and dozens of other experts attacked, and the situation instantly reversed. Hong long long, one expert after another was instantly blown up, and their cries reverberated through the world.Li Hao's sword slashed down, and with a crack, the Queen's arm was severed!At this moment, the Queen was also extremely shocked. Her face turned pale and she roared,""You dare to kill me?"As soon as she finished speaking, a powerful Silver Moon Power swept over from the sky. The Queen activated the Silver Moon Power again and roared,""Don't force me to completely unseal it!"Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky.His eyes flickered.Did the Queen ... Know?I didn't expect that even the Queen, who claims to be the reincarnation of the moon goddess, is just a chess piece. Your so-called use of the Silver Moon's power ... Is not your doing at all, but someone has been following you and monitoring you!It doesn't matter to you normally, but if you really want to transfer all of them and break the seal ... It's impossible!How sad!Ying Hongyue, who was next to him, had already retreated frantically. She grabbed flying sword immortal and vast sky Mountain Master and retreated quickly, wanting to escape. Li Hao's eyes flickered and he attacked with his sword!

2157 Chapter 363
The sword aura filled the world. Not only that, but divine runes also appeared at this moment, turning into li Haos that appeared from all directions.A River of Stars descended and surrounded the world.They sealed off all directions!Right at this moment, Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. She gritted her teeth and suddenly, a powerful Crimson Moon Power burst out. Not only that, but the power of the eight bloodlines above her head suddenly gathered and shook the world!His qi and blood soared!The qi and blood in Li Hao's body also trembled slightly. The sword aura fluctuated for a moment, and Ying Hongyue took advantage of this moment to disappear. Her voice reverberated,"Li Hao, it's not a good idea to kill me now ..."Li Hao chuckled. Suddenly, he pierced his sword in all directions!Crack!In the air, a divine weapon suddenly exploded, and a series of screams were heard. Li Hao chuckled and said,""I'll help you get rid of some burdens. The three of you can continue to wander. I'll help you get rid of these burdens! Also ... Thank you for giving me some benefits ... Find more people and revive some of the world. It'll be best if you can get some weaker Saints to come out. Kill them and I'll give you some benefits!"As soon as he said that, those people who were screaming were all shocked.Ying Hongyue, who was currently fleeing, had a slight change in her expression.At this moment, a muffled groan reverberated through the world.The Queen looked at Li Hao's sword piercing through her throat with disbelief and madness.""You're forcing me?"At that moment, the power of the Silver Moon swept across the world! Li Hao suddenly drew his sword and retreated. He laughed. Interesting!Seeing him retreat, the Queen's eyes were extremely fierce. At this moment, she only wanted to die with him and didn't want to stop at all. However, the Silver Moon Power she had drawn out earlier suddenly went out of control and dissipated a lot.She was shocked!Why was it out of control again?Seeing that Li Hao seemed to be stunned, she was shocked, but she didn't dare to show it. She hurriedly fled. At this moment, she didn't seem to be able to die with Li Hao, but Li Hao's voice appeared in her mind: "Your Silver Moon Power will go out of control. Don't even think about dying with me. You ... Can't make the decision!"What?The Queen was shocked. Li Hao knew?"Follow Ying Hongyue and the others ... You're not strong enough, so attract some more powerful people over and let Ying Hongyue think of a way to revive some of the world. The forbidden Sea is already alive, so why do you have to keep suppressing it? I'll go find you again!" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ The Queen couldn't care about this anymore. At this moment, she was overwhelmed with shock and quickly fled, disappearing from the spot with Ying Hongyue and the other two.As for the remaining people, not a single one of them managed to escape.At this moment, he was being killed by the experts of heaven battling city.A powerful force of the Crimson Moon began to spread. Li Hao absorbed the power of the Crimson Moon crazily. He didn't even look at the immortal energy or the origin Energy. He just absorbed the power of the Crimson Moon."The rest is yours!"Li Hao said and disappeared in an instant.It entered the bright star sector. Heibao was by his side.The moment he entered the bright star realm, the lightning of the great path reacted faster than before. In an instant, it gathered into a bolt of lightning and struck down madly. The power of the Crimson Moon struggled continuously.Boom! Boom! Boom!The power of great DAOs spread over, but Li Hao didn't care. He sat cross-legged and began to absorb the power of the Crimson Moon.One by one, he opened his aperture acupoints.Li Hao smiled. That was great.These experts with the power of the Crimson Moon were the best gifts. With so many undyings, they carried a lot of the power of the Crimson Moon. At this moment, the power of great DAOs gathered, and Li Hao opened his aperture at an extremely fast speed.If he didn't cultivate, it would be equivalent to three to five years of his cultivation!The 36 Dao meridians in the second round were activated one by one. Originally, there were five or six Dao meridians. At that moment, the number instantly increased to 10. In a short while, there were 15 Dao meridians. It was only when he opened nearly 20 Dao meridians that the Thunder of the great path disappeared.Li Hao laughed."That's good!"More than 20 undyings contained a lot of the power of the Crimson Moon. Unfortunately, he was much stronger now. Opening the Dao Meridian would consume more energy.If it was before, he might have been able to open dozens of Dao meridians at once.There were too many!At this moment, he finally had some clues."The Queen is just a puppet ... She's not the real reincarnation of the moon goddesses! Not the second generation Moon Goddess! She's just an ordinary human ... Someone just used her to replace herself. The real Moon Goddess might still be alive!""The fake moon in the sky might not be fake. Perhaps ... It's the moon goddess herself?" he thought."What about the ones sealed?"Li Hao thought for a moment. Perhaps, it was true.Had it split into two?It was possible.The Queen of Scandinavia believed that she was the reincarnation of a God and that she could control the power of the Silver Moon, but someone had given it to her. In fact, she was just a puppet used by the other party to confuse everyone.The moon goddess was the number one God in the Silver Moon.I say, why is he so weak ... And always so easily angered, because he's indeed very young. At such a young age, he already has such great power and is sought after by tens of thousands of people, treated like a god. How can he not be arrogant?The real moon goddesses were definitely not like this.Previously, everyone had thought that she had forgotten some of her past because of her recovery, so no one had paid much attention to it. But now ... Li Hao was certain that this person was not the real Moon Goddess and that she had other Dao meridians."So, the Li family and yueshen are somehow connected, and they might even be in cahoots. Plan for the world!"

Chapter 2158 Silver Moon's Scheme (3)
Even Hong Yue's venerable sovereign was in their plan.At this moment, perhaps Red Moon Emperor did not know that the real moon god had already left. The Silver Moon above his head was just a part of her body."Moon Goddess, perhaps ... You've found the great Dao universe!"Li Hao looked into the depths of the universe. Perhaps, there was a vast star somewhere. Like Zhang an, these people had already entered the bright star Universe.Li Hao's eyes flickered with a fierce light!The universe of the great path is mine.The land of Silver Moon is also mine."I won't allow anyone to set foot in the Dao universe. My teacher, my friends, and my boss are all slumbering here. Once the Dao universe is in turmoil and some stars are completely shattered, perhaps those people will lose the chance to be resurrected.They could be resurrected!There was more than one Dao Meridian in the human body. It was just that their main stars had all exploded. However, there were so many Dao meridians. Among the countless small stars, there might be other stars in their bodies.They could be resurrected.However, if someone set foot in this place and shattered countless stars, they might completely lose their chance of recovery. That was why Li Hao was not willing to randomly shatter stars.Don't kill your own people."The moon goddess" Natal star must be in the vast universe ... Or even ... Was the so-called Prophet left behind to monitor the Queen or something else? His Natal star has never appeared ..."Li Hao's thoughts wavered."Those guys have all been killed. If we had gone all out just now, there was still hope for us to keep the others. Even if we can't kill them, we can at least capture them ... Why ... Let them go?"The ninth Division commander was confused.Ying Hongyue was Li Hao's greatest enemy, but Li Hao didn't go all out to kill her. He only killed the others, including the Queen. He only killed a few gods that followed her.Now, there were still four people who had escaped.Li Hao, why did you show mercy?Li Hao turned to look at the ninth master and suddenly said,""What kind of person is li daoheng?"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The ninth Division commander was stunned. After a long time, he said,""He's very talented! Since I was a child, he has always been above me. I came to heaven battling city ... Because I wanted to stay away from him!"He sighed,"he's better than me in everything. He's also the most talented person in our generation of the Li family!" Even the sword Saint had personally summoned him. His talent is very, very strong. I think he's not weaker than that Zheng Yu!""Being with him made me feel very pressured, so ... When I reached the peak, I left sword city and came to heaven battling city, hoping to stay away from him. In heaven battling city, I could find my confidence and self!""You mean, he might be a Heavenly King now ..." Li Hao frowned."Right, it's not just a possibility, it's almost certain!" The ninth Division commander nodded."Zheng Yu is fine with either. If he is one of the traitors, he has the energy but not the hibernation state. It's impossible for him to not become a Heavenly King!"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. However, the person who left behind the sword intent in the star Town City relic might not have the power of a Heavenly King.Could it be ... A clone?If that was the case, then this person must be extremely powerful to be able to leave behind an undying sword intent even in his clone. "There are many experts in the Li family, right? Other than those who left with the sword Saint, there should be other experts, right?""Of course!"The ninth master nodded his head."There are many. Even if the sword venerable took most of the people away, there would be at least many saints left behind. There might even be some Heavenly Kings ..."Li Hao was silent for a while, then suddenly said,""Ninth master, let me ask you. If venerable Swordmaster leaves and red Moon Emperor enters, can venerable Swordmaster open the seal from the outside?""The Stargate is closed, so it's definitely not possible ... So the seal should be opened by sword city.""Say, did li daoheng open the seal?" Li Hao exhaled."What?""He opened the seal and sealed a venerable sovereign!""Do you think he's capable of doing such a thing?" Li Hao said softly.The ninth Division commander hesitated for a moment before nodding.""To be able to do it, he must be very bold. He has been like this since he was young!"Li Hao's eyes flickered for a while, then he said,""If a venerable sovereign died in the Silvermoon world, would the Silvermoon world be even more powerful?""Of course!"The ninth master nodded."Venerable sovereigns are extremely powerful. If we can kill a venerable sovereign in the Silvermoon world, the originally incomplete Silvermoon world will be instantly perfected!" The power of a venerable sovereign, if it's a top-notch venerable sovereign, actually exceeds the power of the entire world. However, this Red Moon venerable sovereign is probably not a top-notch venerable sovereign. Perhaps she has just entered this level. Otherwise, it would be difficult to seal her for 100000 years ..."Li Hao exhaled and smiled."Also, the existence of venerable sovereigns will give the world a sense of crisis. Heaven's will will will appear. It's also possible to give birth to a great Dao universe, right?""This ..."In fact, he had some speculations before that the silence of the world for many years might have been to nurture the great Dao of the world.However, there was no evidence.At this moment, Li Hao had many thoughts. He said,""A hundred thousand years ago, even if you seized the Silver Moon world and became a venerable sovereign, would you still be the weakest venerable sovereign?""Probably ... So?""It's hard to tell," the ninth master said with uncertainty."It's hard to say because he's too far away from being a venerable sovereign ..."Li Hao continued,"but if the Silver Moon has given birth to heaven's will, a world Dao, or a venerable sovereign, is such a small world still a small world? If I refine this world, will I become a top venerable sovereign?"

"Probably ... So!""Such courage and ambition!" Li Hao laughed.Li Hao sighed, I kind of understand now!What do you understand?Li Hao sighed with emotion, Ninth Division commander, you're much worse than your brother! Zheng Yu was even more so! The same was true for Red Moon Emperor! No matter how ambitious these people are, they only want to become venerable sovereigns. Zheng Yu's life goal is probably to reach the venerable sovereign level ..."However, there was someone who did not think that way.What was the point of devouring a small world?What was the point of becoming the weakest venerable sovereign?I want to cultivate it!They would nurture a new Dao universe, nurture the Heaven's Will, nurture a powerful world that was not weaker than the new martial arts world, devour a venerable sovereign, stabilize the heaven and earth, and then devour the world!At that time, even if it wasn't as good as the neo martial world, the gap wouldn't be too big.Then, he would be in charge of new Dao, break free from the control of new martial, and become the master of all Dao. He would not be any worse than a human King!Li daoheng?Is that you?If that was the case, then it would really be incredible!After spending a hundred thousand years, he was not a waste. Maybe the human King and the others had only left for a few years. The chaotic time was chaotic. Perhaps in his opinion, in a few years, he had become a top-notch venerable sovereign and was not weaker than the human King. Maybe ... He could even go to the red moon world and take a share of the loot!The ninth Division commander seemed to have understood what he meant. He said in disbelief,""You mean to say ...""I'm just guessing!"Li Hao smiled."Right now, we don't have enough evidence. However, we can think of your brother in a more impressive way." The sword Saint had personally summoned the people of the Li family. Would they be so useless? Not appearing for a hundred thousand years ... Would it? Maybe ... I've been watching you all this time!"He laughed and looked into the depths of the universe, muttering,""Maybe ... He just couldn't find the great Dao universe before. When I found it, he had already entered!"The ninth Division commander was shocked. He looked into the depths of the universe with a serious expression."You mean ... He cultivated a new Dao and entered the bright star sector?"Li Hao was slightly moved. He nodded."Maybe, he might have re-cultivated! In that case, perhaps ... He had crippled himself? He might be the one in the ruins of Star Town ..."At this thought, Li Hao said softly,'I've just reached the Dao integration stage, what about him? I should be the limit ... But if I can get the blessing of heaven's will, I might be able to break this limit, but I need heaven's will to be strong ..."Could it be what he had guessed?If this person was compared to the descendant of the Fengyun Pavilion, he was much more amazing.He was much more capable than Zheng Yu.Even venerable sovereigns had been played by him.The venerable sovereign Hong Yue might not have been sealed by venerable the sword. If venerable the sword had the time to seal her ... He might have killed her with one strike of his sword! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ The more he knew about these top venerable sovereigns, the more he understood how powerful they were.Ordinary venerable sovereigns, such as li Fuhai's grandfather, were definitely not comparable to people like venerable the sword.  "Oh?" Li Hao smiled and looked at the ninth master."Could Ying Hongyue be li daoheng's bloodline?""What?""That's impossible,"the ninth Division commander frowned."If that was the case ... Why would he kill your parents and strip them of their bloodline to gather the power of the eight great families" bloodline ..."It made sense.Li Hao nodded slightly."Even if she isn 't, Ying Hongyue might be li daoheng's chess piece ...""So, I have one more enemy." Li Hao smiled.The ninth master was silent.Li Hao exhaled."As for the moon goddess, she was the first God of the Silver Moon. The first God ... Let me think ... Is there a relationship between the celestial Emperor and the seed?" Or was it the relationship between the human Emperor and Emperor Cang? The God spirit will replace the Heaven's Will and become the seed, becoming Emperor Cang ... And the other one will become the celestial Emperor, the king of humans!""If he was the one who activated the seal, and Silvermoon's main body was inside acting as the seal, that means ... He might be able to freely enter and exit the seal with Silvermoon's main body!"The ninth Division commander frowned and looked at Li Hao, thinking that Li Hao was overthinking.Li daoheng ... Was his own brother really that powerful?Freely enter and exit the seal?If they worked together with yueshen, yueshen would become the seed to become the Cang Emperor, while her brother hoped to become an existence like the human King or the celestial Emperor?Li Hao, on the other hand, was even more certain of this.Also, perhaps he was the one who had spread the folk songs.The Zheng family was only a pawn on the surface.On the one hand, the existence of the Zheng family was to give an explanation to new martial arts, and on the other hand, it was also to confuse the venerable sovereign of Red Moon ...Perhaps he was the one who had brought out the starry sky sword!However, there was one more point. Why did he expose himself in front of Sun Xin?What if he revealed his true identity in front of the Vice commander of the star Army?If not for that, who would have known that someone from the Li family was involved?This was something that could not be explained.Sun Xin was only an undying back then. Was there a need for li daoheng to reveal his identity in front of this person?Or perhaps ... The more real it was, the less suspicious it would be?With his personality, placing the fake silver Moon in the air, the feeling of hiding in the city, perhaps ... Was his personality.Thinking of this, Li Hao asked, does your brother like to laugh at others?"What?"Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"that is to say, sometimes, when he does something, no one knows that he did it. But he will take the initiative to tell some people, leaving them helpless. It's this kind of behavior. You know he did it, but you can't expose him."
