Lin Hongyu was not too concerned about this. She frowned and said,""Then ... I have to be reborn like you?"This ... Is this good?Li Hao said, that's the best! After all ... You're like me, you've summoned a future self before, and a dead one at that ... It might have left behind many flaws. It shouldn't be too hard for you to go through it again. The key is ... You can still be a little younger. Maybe you'll be able to level up quickly like me ... Then you won't be in your 30s anymore ..."“……”Lin Hongyu was stunned!'I ...'He really wanted to curse!The others were also speechless. At this time, was there really a need to care about these things?For venerable sovereigns, was there a big difference between thirty years old, three hundred years old, or even thirty thousand years old?You, Li Hao ... Aren't you being too demanding?Wasn't this guy very open-minded?She's a little older than you, so what?Lin Hongyu was speechless and did not continue the conversation. Instead, she asked,""If I were to walk the path of life and death, wouldn't I also have to face the primal Chaos lightning tribulation? You can resist it ... But I probably can 't! You're not just a mere life-death Emperor, your sword-intent is also very powerful, and you've dabbled in other Grand DAOs as well. As for me...My understanding of the Dao isn't as deep as yours. Will I be able to overcome the Tribulation of life and death?"She wasn't li Hao.Not every cultivator of the Dao of life and death would be able to transcend the Tribulation successfully and the primal Chaos lightning tribulation would lose its meaning.The Thunder tribulation was meant to test and kill the life and death Emperor.Li Hao dealt with it easily. It was his most powerful attack, not just the great Dao of life and death.Li Hao nodded,"not a big problem!" Now that your stars have entered my River of Life and death ... In fact, you can be considered to be cultivating the same Dao as me. At most, when you transcend your tribulation, I'll borrow the power of your River of great Dao. Even if you grind it down, you should be able to grind it down! There should only be nine of them, and the last one might be a full-power Strike from a chaos behemoth ... You should be able to take it!"When the crowd heard this, they were a little envious and a little scared.The Chaos Beast's full-power attack was not weak.It was not impossible for ordinary venerable sovereigns who had just advanced to the venerable sovereign level to be killed in one blow before their strength had undergone a huge transformation.As expected, this path was not one that ordinary people could take.Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, was almost one with Li Hao's River. Li Hao's Foundation was enough to force his way through.Sure enough, when one person achieved Dao, his chickens and dogs would rise to heaven!Heaven's Fate and the others were not surprised.Back then, the human King and the others had successfully advanced. Many people had relied on them to forcefully become monarchs. It could be considered as a rise in status for one person. In every era, there would be such an opportunity.Li Hao then looked at Hong Yitang and the others."Now that chaos has connected with Silver Moon, it'll be much easier for the two of you. All you need is some time, and everyone will be advancing ... The entire Silver Moon is also breathing chaos Qi, and the world will be advancing. In fact, even if the two of you don't cultivate, you can become emperors as time passes!" "Even a small world can naturally become a monarch, not to mention a medium world ... Silvermoon will definitely give birth to a few venerable sovereigns!"These people had all taken advantage of Silver moon's promotion.It was only a matter of time before a master of the great Dao in a medium-sized world became a great emperor. It was not difficult at all.Now, the difficulty was that other than these few ... It was really difficult for others to become emperors.Including Yuan Shuo!Li Hao turned his head and glanced at Yuan Shuo. His teacher was very talented, but ... After all, he had died once, and there were too few opportunities after that. Now that the Dao universe had been divided, it was too difficult for him to vindicate his Dao and become an Emperor!Yuan Shuo was most skilled in the five elements Dao. If he could fully control the five elements, there was a chance for him to become a five elements Supreme Emperor.But ... Even the master of the great Dao had not become a great emperor.Only when these two great Dao Masters became monarchs first, the entire river of chaos would become stronger, the five elements of the people would become stronger, and Yuan Shuo would be in charge of the five elements. Only then would he have a chance to become the five elements Supreme Emperor after these two.In this way, just like how Lin Hongyu could not surpass him, Yuan Shuo would not be able to surpass the two masters of the great Dao.A branch, no matter how strong the branch was, it would be difficult to compete with the main branch.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly asked, senior Zhang, did you sense the existence of the universe of origin?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "No!" Zhang an was stunned and shook his head.Li Hao nodded slightly. It seemed that the reach of the Dao universe was limited.Although the universe of origin was powerful, it still could not radiate over.However, last time, he seemed to have sensed the existence of the universe of origin when he was outside the Silver Moon and at the barrier. Could it be that ... The new martial was nearby at that time?It can't be, right?If new martial was nearby, why didn't he look for Silver Moon back then?According to his understanding, this should not have happened. What Li Hao didn't know was that the neo martial human King had been hovering around the Crimson Moon for more than ten years, which was equivalent to the Silver Moon for twenty to thirty thousand years. During this period, he had passed by the Silver Moon several times and radiated his radiation into the Silver Moon.The other party might have only passed by for a short time, but it could affect Silver Moon for decades or even centuries.Now that he had walked out, the impact of the chaos and the departure of the human Kings had left him completely undetectable.Without the universe of origin, Zhang an's old Dao was still weak.The new and old DAOs couldn't be perfectly integrated, so it would be more difficult for Zhang an to become a venerable sovereign than Qian Wuliang and the others.Li Hao did some mental calculations. According to celestial pole and the others, there were at least three to five venerable sovereigns in an ordinary middle-level world.

Chapter 2581 Setting Off (Part 4)
Currently, Silvermoon was still inferior to ordinary middle-level worlds.He would have to wait until the two masters of the great Dao advanced, and then Black Panther, himself, and Lin Hongyu. It would be best if he could advance to the second stage. Only then would he be considered a proper middle-level world.Otherwise, his current strength would not be much different from that of a small world.Silver Moon had advanced too quickly."Black Panther!"Li Hao didn't say anything else. He said,""Search and see if there are any signs of life. Make contact with chaos creatures! Don't be too strong ... If you encounter one, quickly run away!""Woof!"The giant beast let out a dog bark.Today, the shape of the giant beast had actually changed slightly. The Black Panther was in the process of transformation, hoping to transform into a dog. However, the time he could control it was too short. It was still too early to completely transform into a dog.……At this moment, the giant beast was still wandering in the chaos.In the place where Li Hao and the others had gone through their tribulation, a powerful being appeared. Sensing the presence of chaos, he looked into the distance and frowned.The Silvermoon world had actually disappeared.In that case ... They were either taken away or devoured.Should he continue chasing?He could still sense some Weak Auras remaining. If he followed them, he might be able to catch up, but ... He was not clear about the specific situation at the moment. Once he left the coverage area of the Crimson Moon world, although he could still use the power to wake people up in the chaos, he would be in some trouble without the advantage of being in his own territory.It was also very difficult to obtain support!In reality, the Black Panther had not gone too far away with the Silvermoon world. If they were to chase after it, there was still hope that they would be able to track it down.At that moment, the fourth-rank venerable sovereign hesitated.On the other hand, neo martial had broken through the two major worlds, putting great pressure on Red Moon.The neo martial human King might still be lingering nearby.If he was alone and encountered a neo martial human King ... He had already killed a level Seven venerable sovereign, so why would he care about killing a level four?After much consideration, the venerable sovereign decided to stay within the range of the Crimson Moon.Looking into the distance, they were North of the Crimson Moon, and even further north was another great world.The entire chaos, North, South, East, and West, were not randomly defined.Chaos had no direction. When there was a direction, it was difficult for ordinary people to distinguish it. However, as long as one knew that the further north one went, the more chaotic it became, and that was right.Over there, it was even more chaotic than this chaotic region.In fact, this place had been relatively peaceful until Red Moon and new martial chose to go to war, which disturbed the situation here. However, it was said that the other side was even more chaotic.Did the Silvermoon world go that way?……At the same time. In the yin-yang world, a huge cat, much bigger than the Black Panther, was flying in the void.After breaking through Elysian world, neo martial chose to leave.If they didn't leave, they might face the encirclement and suppression of many major cosmos absolute beings. This time, neo martial could be considered to have completely opened the prologue of the chaos War. They had killed two major cosmos absolute beings in one day, which brought a huge threat to the nearby worlds.Although a world could move, it was actually very difficult to move a large world. Moreover, chaos had no limits. No one knew what would happen if they moved randomly.In the chaos, there were countless dangers.It was born in this place and had existed here for countless years. Under normal circumstances, the world would not simply drift away.Meanwhile, in the yin-yang world.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  In a huge Hall.One of the venerable sovereigns was at a loss. The Supreme venerable above spoke,""Celestial pole, only your clone is still in the Silvermoon world. Only you can lock onto the Silvermoon's position!""Silver Moon has just broken through the Stargate and connected to the chaos. The situation is still unclear. Under such circumstances ... It would be the best choice to bring Silver Moon back!"Below, Empyrean fate was in a dilemma.It was so dangerous!He could vaguely sense the location of the clone, but ... It was very far away!With his strength that had just reached rank three venerable sovereign, who knew how long it would take for him to catch up to Silver Moon?The chaos was too big!A single wrong step would take a lot of time to correct.The point was ... They had to pass through the territory of several large worlds. Was this any different from seeking death?The new martial arts now ... Was almost hated by everyone!"A Paragon ..."Celestial pole felt helpless,'can I not go? "I see that Silver Moon world, it's possible ... It's possible that it's in a moving state and not fixed. The position of my clone seems to have changed! Maybe ... It was devoured by the Chaos Beast?"This thing was still moving.If he didn't move, it would be easier to find, but now that he moved, it was even more difficult to find!The Grandmaster only looked at him with a smile that wasn't a smile. Celestial pole was somewhat helpless. Every time this person laughed like this ... It meant that he had bad intentions! He had a headache!If it was possible, I really wanted to sleep until the next era. I don't know when I would be able to kill these troublemakers.It was useless to be strong. It was better to live longer."The celestial Thearch is also powerful, but look, he's still dead. Most of the people in the same generation are dead, but I, Heaven's Fate, have lived until now and survived one era after another ...It was too dangerous to look for Silver Moon now."It's really difficult to get you to do something!"Grandmaster laughed.Celestial pole also looked innocent."It's not difficult ... I'm not rejecting it. It's just ... It's too far away. In my opinion, we have to cross the Crimson Moon world!" If we take a detour, it might take us decades ... I'm too weak, and I'm not a human king who can casually cross the primal Chaos. "

Chapter 2582 Setting Off (Part 5)
"By the time I find Silver Moon, he'll probably be long gone ..."The Supreme martial artist laughed and thought for a while."This time, we've broken through bliss. We've broken through their world and their great Dao universe. If you're willing to go, I'll give you a tenth of the source of the world!" You're now a third rank venerable sovereign. If you can devour one-tenth of the source of a large world, you'll be no less than a medium-level world ... It won't be long before you advance to fourth rank!""But if you miss this opportunity, it will be as difficult as ascending to heaven for you to enter the fourth tier!"He looked at the celestial pole and said,'it's not that I have to bring Silver Moon back, but there are still many new martial artists in Silver moon's land! It's been many years since the Silvermoon isolated herself from the primordial chaos, but I can't say for sure exactly how long. ""But those people have left their homeland for too long!"The Grandmaster sighed."We've tried to search for it over the past fifty years, but ... The Silver Moon has sealed itself off and concealed itself. The chaos is too vast, and there are powerful enemies nearby. We've never been able to find it ..."Heaven's Fate cursed silently. You should be looking for your grandson.Why did he make it sound so Grand?That's right, your grandson is still among them.As he was thinking, the Supreme martial artist continued,"actually, it's not to find Zhang an. If he's dead, so be it ... The point is, second cat is over there!" Don't force me to ask the lazy cat to talk to you ... Otherwise, you know ..."Heaven's Fate's expression changed, and he was somewhat speechless!You're f * cking scaring me with a cat again!I grew up being scared?Just as he was thinking, a voice suddenly sounded in his ear,""Meow Meow ... Little celestial pole, are you going to find second cat?"“……”Heaven's Fate was speechless.'I ...' If I say I'm not going, what will you do to me?Eat me?Probably ... Not. Zhi Zun and the others wouldn't really do that, but ... But they would definitely be turned into small dried fish and then dried, and played with by cats for many years.But then again, it's nothing to be toyed with for a while ... I'll just treat it as sleeping!Most importantly, this cat was sometimes very muddle-headed. When it slept, it would sometimes take the initiative to eat dried fish ... When that happened, there was no guarantee!Unlucky!He didn't want to take on this job at all.Even if the other party used a rank four venerable sovereign to tempt him, he would not be too interested. However, at this time, he could only helplessly say,""Alright, alright, alright, I'll go, alright? But I'm too slow ..."The Supreme Being smiled."It's fine. A few days ago, the divine Creator just happened to build a chaos long-distance ship. It's also a coincidence ... It's very fast, no less than the speed of a fourth or fifth stage venerable sovereign. If you pilot this ship, your speed will increase a lot. You don't need to determine the direction of the chaos, just follow the direction of the avatar. At most, you should be able to find the other party in three to five years!""Of course, if Hongyue and new martial arts go to war at that time, you don't have to come back. It's actually safer for you!" If the war hasn't started yet ... You can bring your men back. "Heaven's Fate's heart moved and he nodded.""This one's fine!"Grandmaster seemed to have seen through him long ago and smiled,"In addition, if the Silvermoon tribesmen are unwilling to come with them, then so be it! The Silver Moon should have given birth to its own King!""Of course, with your personality, it's better to avoid trouble. If the other party doesn't come, you'll be happy to do so!"Heaven's Fate was embarrassed.How could that be!"In addition, if you go alone, I'm worried that you'll find a place to sleep on the way and won't be willing to continue ... Since you can do such a thing, let King Huai accompany you!"Heaven's Fate's mouth fell open. Was this ... Appropriate?King Huai is more afraid of death than I am!Aren't you afraid that we'll sleep together and not go?The Supreme martial artist smiled faintly."I'm not worried that King Huai will be like you. Although he's afraid of death, he also wants to become stronger. As long as we bring him back, I'll make the decision to give him 10% of the origin of the macro world. He's only reached the second stage now. If he devours it, there's hope for him to reach the third or even the fourth stage ... King Huai is much more proactive than you!""The reason why I let him go with you is because King Huai is afraid of death and extremely vigilant. To be able to survive until now is also a Testament to his ability ... If you two go together, not only will you have combat power, you will still have the confidence to survive! I also don't want to risk your life to find Zhang an and the others. Otherwise, your father won't be happy!""If it wasn't for the fact that the war could start at any time, it would be best if your father went over!"He was also an extremely cowardly expert ... Even more cowardly than the celestial pole.He was a true-blue old venerable sovereign!Emperor Xi, one of the nine emperors and four Emperors, was now a fifth-stage venerable sovereign. In terms of strength, he was much stronger than an ordinary medium-level world Lord. Unfortunately ... This guy had no desires. If he could lie down, he would definitely not stand.Unless all the great world origin was given to him, it would be too difficult to make him work.Heaven's Fate pursed his lips and didn't say anything. My father?My father knows that I'm going and not him, so he can't wait to go!If I don't go, then my father might have to go. It's all because of my clone. Not only can I sense it, but my father might be able to sense it through his bloodline."Alright, so be it, Huai King ... Although his strength is not that great, he is good at escaping ..."Why are you two big Brothers talking about second brother?The Grandmaster smiled and said,"before you go, meet the longevity sword and ask him if he has anything to say." In addition ..."He thought for a moment before frowning,'the new king of Silver Moon might be skilled in the Dao of time. This Dao is very strong and unique, but it is also very ... Eye-catching! The enemy should have been North of the Crimson Moon, and now they should be moving further north ... It's even more chaotic there!""More chaotic?"Tian Ji was startled. Zhi Zun knew that he had scared this guy and immediately said,""Of course, the Silvermoon world doesn't move very fast. You should be able to catch up to them before they reach the chaotic lands!"Heaven's Fate rolled his eyes."In short, you've met the new king of Silver Moon. With your personality and your avatar, you should have judged the situation clearly and there shouldn't be any conflict ... Tell the new king that Silver Moon originated from neo martial. It's fine if he doesn't want to return to neo martial. However, if he can't survive, he can come to neo martial to take refuge!"As soon as he finished speaking, a jade pendant appeared in front of the celestial pole."Give this to the new king!"Heaven's Fate took it and glanced at it. He looked suspiciously at Zhi Zun."It can't be your clone, right?""How could I!"Grandmaster laughed, and Heaven's Fate put on a fake smile. It was hard to say.You often do this!'A clone can also monitor whether I'm working or not. Really ... Annoying!'"Alright, you can go!"The Grandmaster couldn't be bothered to say anything more. There were too many things to do at the moment, and he didn't have the mood to talk to this fellow.Heaven's Fate didn't stay any longer. Feeling somewhat helpless, he turned around and left. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It was really an undeserved disaster!If I had known that there would be such a problem when I stayed at Silver Moon back then, I would not have accepted the mission even if you beat me to death.How troublesome!He had thought that he would only need his clone to sleep for a while and everything would be over.By the time he walked out of the hall, another middle-aged expert with a humble expression was already waiting for him. With a smile on his face, he said,""Senior Empyrean terminus, I've already received the Supreme Being's order. When are we setting off?""Are you in a hurry to reincarnate?" celestial pole was speechless.“……”The man was not angry, and his smile remained.""That's not it. I'm just afraid that the Supreme martial artists will wait for too long and throw us to the front line to become frontline combatants. Although you and I are venerable sovereigns, compared to the others ... We're still far from them."The war was approaching. If he accepted this mission now, there would be benefits, and it would be good to escape."What's the hurry?"Heaven's Fate muttered as he walked,""There are many dangers on the road! And the return journey was even more dangerous! Also, it's hard to say if the new king of the Silver Moon will let him go ..."The middle-aged Huai King was slightly stunned, but he nodded. "You're right! "The Kings of the new era, without exception, all think highly of themselves. It doesn't matter. This is also the reason why senior and I were sent there. Let's keep a low profile. We don't care about our face anyway. At most, we can say a few soft words and ask them for help ... That shouldn't be a big problem, right?"“……”Heaven's Fate was speechless. 'F * ck, you're even more shameless than me!'Come to think of it, at this time, the Supreme martial artist is sending us away ... Is it also because he doesn't want to see us?"The war is coming. If we're obsequious and lose neo martial arts 'face, we might as well throw it out so that we won't be annoyed.There was always a feeling of being abandoned!How sad!He was too lazy to say anything more. He was going to meet the revered Sword Master. That little fellow ... He could not call him that now. That fellow was probably either at the fifth or sixth rank now. He was really terrifying!He did not know if the new king of Silver Moon had anything to do with him. Silver Moon was the Li family's fief, and he did not know what the sword Saint was thinking.……On this day, a warship set off from new martial and crossed the chaos.The two venerable sovereigns of new martial, who were notorious for their fear of death, steered the warship and began to set off in the direction of Silver Moon.

Chapter 2583 A Wild Horse Out Of Control (1)
Primal Chaos void.The Black Panther couldn't tell which direction it was going. All it knew was to run in the opposite direction of the Crimson Moon. For now, the Crimson Moon world was still the Silver Moon's greatest threat.In the vast universe, it was too difficult to meet a living being.In the chaos, there was no black or white, no night or white.All he knew was that ten days and ten nights had passed in the Silvermoon world, but in the chaosverse, Black Panther felt as if he had been frozen in place. The environment around him was the same, and in the distance, there seemed to be a star ... And it was still very far away.Li Hao also felt emotional.In the Silver Moon world, he, a venerable sovereign, could travel from south to north, from east to west in an instant. However, in the chaos, a journey was like a turtle's speed.It was simply too difficult to encounter a living being.Previously, he was still thinking of picking and choosing a weaker one to talk about chaos with ... In the end, he didn't even see one, let alone pick one.Previously, when Silver Moon opened the Stargate, he was considered lucky to have encountered a beast of primordial chaos.As for Red Moon sovereign, he had come on orders. It was not a coincidence.Li Hao had thought that experts were everywhere in the chaos.Now, it seemed that ... On one hand, the chaos was too large. On the other hand, there were very few experts. If they were scattered, there actually weren't many.Perhaps, he had not encountered a place with many people."You still haven't met anyone?"Li Hao sat on the huge black Panther and sighed. He didn't like to stay in the Silvermoon world anymore. A world was just the belly of the Black Panther, and it was too small for him.Yearning for chaos was actually a pursuit that all experts had.However...Although the primordial chaos was vast, it was boring without anyone.No one meant that there was no great opportunity to speak of.The Black Panther was quite at ease. It breathed in and out some chaos energy to strengthen itself, and also to strengthen the entire Silvermoon world. Only when the Silvermoon world leveled up could it continue to level up.Of course, currently, Black Panther still had room for advancement.However, it was very difficult to transcend the entire world!Back then, li daoheng and the others were bent on devouring the world, the great DAOs, the universe, and everything ... Li Hao didn't quite understand it at the time, but he did now.If they devoured all of them, they might be able to enter the second stage. The second stage of venerable sovereigns was indeed not something that ordinary venerable sovereigns could compare with.Of course, from the current situation, even if he devoured it, it was impossible for him to be the opponent of the neo martial human King.That person had most likely entered the third stage.Otherwise, it wouldn't have directly blown up a great Dao universe. Although Li Hao couldn't see clearly on the day of the explosion, he could sense a thing or two. It should have been the scene of a great Dao universe exploding.It was much stronger than Silvermoon's great Dao universe.Li Hao was a little bored as he thought about this. Suddenly, he looked behind him.Someone was there?Did he finally meet someone?His mood suddenly became much better ... Of course, he was also a little vigilant and uneasy. From behind ... Could it be a Crimson Moon expert? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Although he had entered the venerable sovereign realm, it was not a high level. He could still fight against an ordinary venerable sovereign. If he encountered a powerful existence, he would not be able to resist. However, the temptation on his side was not small.The great path universe and the medium-level world were things that some experts coveted. Especially the Dao universe!Under normal circumstances, great worlds would only be born, and great worlds all had top-notch experts. Some chaos Rangers liked to invade and devour worlds without experts."Heibao, is there someone?"Li Hao asked, afraid that he might be mistaken.The Black Panther let out a Low Dog bark. There was indeed a person, and he was not slow. At least, he was faster than the Black Panther. Because the Black Panther carried a world on its back, its movement speed was actually very slow.At this moment, in the distance, in the darkness, a human figure appeared.In an instant, the other party seemed to have noticed Li Hao's group as well. They stopped in their tracks and even prepared to turn around. In the chaos, experts didn't like to group up, which often meant trouble.Those who could travel through the chaos were almost all existences at the venerable sovereign level.Unless it was a top-notch expert, it would not be a good thing if there was a conflict between the two of them.The person in the distance glanced over.He was also in human form, but his figure was somewhat illusionary.His breath was a little messy, and he seemed to have some injuries on his body. For venerable sovereigns, if their injuries had not healed while they were walking, it meant that they were seriously injured.Across the chaos, the other party glanced over with a hint of wariness in his eyes.Similarly, Li Hao was also very vigilant.He was also silently sensing some things. As a venerable Emperor of life and death, it was extremely easy for him to sense some life forces. After making a judgment, he heaved a sigh of relief. They were not too strong.It was probably the same as the Chaos Beast that the Black Panther had taken over.He wasn't the weakest venerable sovereign, but he wasn't much stronger either. That was good. Otherwise, he would have to be more careful.The person in the distance had wanted to take a detour, or perhaps he had judged their strength. A second rank Beast of Chaos and a first rank venerable sovereign ... They were not too strong.If they took a detour and went in the wrong direction in the chaotic region, they might walk for a long time and encounter more danger."Fellow Daoists up ahead, I am the chaos Wanderer, mi an. I am on my way to the Skylands world. Fellow Daoists, are you two heading there as well?"That person didn't even get close. He shook the primordial chaos from a distance and spoke.

Chapter 2584 A Wild Horse Out Of Control (2)
Li Hao glanced at it and said,""May I know where the tianfang world is? I am the master of the bright moon world, Li Hao. The bright moon world is only a newborn small world, and I do not know much about chaos. A few days ago, there was a turmoil in the rear, and this Chaos Beast and I were preparing to take refuge!"A newbie?The master of a small world?Zuan was slightly startled. How could the Lord of a small world be involved with chaos beasts?It was a little strange!He looked at the Chaos Beast again ... He was a little puzzled. The master of a small world would not leave a small world unless ... The world was swallowed!The situation was a little complicated.Of course, he didn't ask in detail. It was enough to know that the other party wasn't an elite from a major world. Under normal circumstances, an elite from a major world wouldn't impersonate anyone ... Unless his reputation was too bad, such as that of a neo martial artist.It was just a neo martial artist, let's not mention it!"Li ... Fellow Daoist Li Hao, can I go a little closer?"Li Hao nodded."Of course ... Daoist zu an, you don't have to be so polite. This is the chaos, not my home. You can go anywhere you want ..."Zu an sighed. A newcomer!He was indeed a newcomer!Can go anywhere? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  You must be joking.In the chaos, there are more dangers than you can imagine.Furthermore ... He allowed people to get close to him as he pleased. Alright, it might be related to the fact that he wasn't too strong. Otherwise, under normal circumstances, he would go as far as he could. Unless he knew someone, otherwise, who would let someone he didn't know get close?He also checked to prevent it from being a trap, but it didn't look like it.Therefore, he flew through the air and approached the giant beast. He sized it up again. This giant beast ... Why wasn't it talking?Before he could ask, Li Hao said,"fellow Daoist, you can come up!" This Chaos Beast is actually my pet, and we've been relying on each other since we were young. Because I don't understand these things, I still can't speak ... And I haven't taught it. "“……”Zu an almost wanted to laugh.A second level venerable sovereign was your pet and couldn't speak.You ... You're only at the first rank, right?Of course, looking at Li Hao's expression ... The world was so big that there were all sorts of strange things. Perhaps it was true that anything could happen in the chaos. It was also common for some Chaos Beast Cubs to be stranded in the world or to seek refuge in the world when they were injured.This was also the opportunity for some world powerhouses. He was not completely suspicious. He just felt that ... If a second level venerable sovereign still could not speak, this giant beast ... Might not really not know how to speak, but was just unwilling to.Perhaps, it was another unbearable past.Since Li Hao had invited him, he didn't stand on ceremony and flew over.Only then did he look at Li Hao and see him clearly.What a world Lord!Sure enough, even the Lords of small worlds were favored by the heavens and had endless fortunes. Li Hao was full of vitality, and his face even had a hint of childishness. His eyes were also extremely clear ...This was obviously a real young man!Only new worlds could give birth to such young venerable sovereigns. New worlds had many opportunities. Although there were few experts, they were usually very young.At this moment, Li Hao was also somewhat happy.He had encountered a living person!It was said that there were all kinds of creatures in the chaotic world. It was common to encounter humanoid creatures, but not all of them were human. They might be humanoid creatures."Fellow Daoist, you've come at the right time!"Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony. Like a newborn calf, he was bold and straightforward. "I've been troubled these days. I know nothing about chaos and don't know what to do! I don't know where to go or how to communicate with fellow Daoist Hundun ... There are some ancient civilizations in my small world that have mentioned the chaos, but they don't know much about it. I invited you here in the hope of learning some information from you ..."Although he said that, if this person was very powerful, far beyond his imagination, he would definitely not dare to invite him. It was best to avoid him.However, this person was on par with Black Panther, so he was not that afraid.Since that was the case, there was no need to pretend to be very familiar with chaos. They were all experts, and he might give himself away after some exchanges. He might as well pretend to be inexperienced. Moreover, he really did not understand chaos.p To be able to meet in the primordial chaos could be considered fate."The chaos Wanderer that fellow Daoist mentioned ..." Li Hao continued without stopping."Are you the chaos Rangers recorded in our world?""A Ranger?"Zu an was stunned for a moment before he smiled. "It's just that ... Rangers might be your dialect or local language. In the chaos, those who wander around the chaos are called chaos Wanderers. Of course, under normal circumstances, they are creatures without a world behind them. Those who exist in a world usually don't say this and will introduce themselves ... The premise is that this is a major world. A medium or small world is not well-known and doesn't have the qualifications!"The two of them were currently communicating through their minds. Chaos did not have much in common, and the communication between experts did not require such things.There were countless languages in the various worlds, much less the entire chaos. It was a waste of time to learn these. It was extremely convenient and troublesome to communicate with one's mind.At this moment, zu an felt a little more at ease. He was also looking for a place to rest for a while, but he was worried about the danger.Seeing Li Hao's inexperience, he had an idea."Fellow Daoist Li, can I take a short rest here and recuperate a little? I was involved in a big battle just now, and was injured ...."

"Of course you can!""Do you need my help?" Li Hao asked hurriedly."There's no need for that!"When zu an saw this, he immediately sat down cross-legged and started to heal his injuries. However, he still maintained his consciousness and didn't dare to forget himself.This was only the first time they met ... Even though he was young, he was the Lord of a small world. He knew that Li Hao wasn't as pure as he appeared.In the primordial chaos, whoever believed that the other party was a good person, a simple and honest person...Would be an idiot.However, if the conflict of interest wasn't too big, there wouldn't be any conflicts under normal circumstances.Seeing that Li Hao seemed to be eager to try, he was probably really in a hurry, so he didn't hold back on purpose. He smiled and said,""Does fellow Daoist li want to ask me about the chaos? If there's anything you don't understand, feel free to ask ... However, I don't know much about the chaos, and we don't move around in a large area. "Li Hao didn't hold back. He hurriedly said,""Earlier, you said that you were affected by the battle ... I did see some scenes, as if something had exploded. Can you explain it to me? I've just come out of a small world, and I've already encountered such a thing ... I was so scared!"A small world ...A Chaos Beast!At this moment, zu an's heart moved slightly. If that was the case, the small world that this person was in might be within the body of the Beast of Chaos.He was really bold!He had some guesses in his mind, but he didn't say it out loud. He smiled and said,""The great Dao universe of a great world exploded! I wonder if you know about the neo martial yin-yang world?""I know," Li Hao nodded.Zu an was startled. You know?Li Hao explained,"in my world, it seems that a neo martial artist passed by in the past. He even left behind some traces of the ancient civilization ... But it was many years ago. It was probably tens of thousands of years ago.""Tens of thousands of years ago?"Zu an was stunned for a moment, but he quickly nodded."From the looks of it, it's indeed a sealed small world. The flow of time is different!" The neo martial artists had only appeared in the chaos for a thousand years ... Had any neo martial artists been there? "That's right...Many of the new martial artists are wandering in the chaos. It seems that your world has just advanced and is not considered strong. The new martial artists are still okay. Under normal circumstances, they are too weak. If you don't provoke them, they won't provoke you. "After saying that, he added,"if fellow Daoist knows, then it's simple!" A few days ago, neo martial had launched a surprise attack on the bliss World and The Dark World, breaking through the two worlds in one fell swoop and killing two top venerable sovereigns! The neo martial human King directly exploded the dark great Dao universe. At the same time, he also killed many powerful venerable sovereigns, including a sixth-level master of the great Dao ... It's extremely terrifying!""AI!"Zu an shook his head."The battle between these top-tier existences is also troublesome for us wandering chaos beings. I'm also unlucky. I was just at the side of the nethermoon world, and the other party suddenly moved the world, almost killing me! Fortunately, I was lucky and escaped. I could only escape from that place to avoid being killed!"Li Hao still didn't quite understand, but he did know that neo martial arts had broken through two major worlds in one day. He was also speechless. "Is the great world ... Very powerful?""Rank 6? what level is that?"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  “……”Zu an laughed. This person really didn't understand.Of course, the primal Chaos didn't lack these people. However, under normal circumstances, the Lord of a small world would rarely leave the world."In the entire primordial chaos, there are four types of worlds: major worlds, medium worlds, minor worlds, and unrated worlds that aren't considered minor worlds! The birth of venerable sovereigns means a small world, which means that they have the most basic qualification to wander the chaos!"Li Hao nodded."As for the sixth level ..." Zu an continued,"in the chaos, there are many world Lords and venerable sovereigns ... In order to unify the realms and know each other's strength, the entire venerable sovereign level has been reduced to the ninth level!""Rank one is for those who have just advanced to venerable sovereign ... For example, fellow Daoist!""Is it very weak?" Li Hao asked, somewhat embarrassed."It doesn 't!"Zu an laughed."It's just that the chaos is too big compared to the greater world. There are countless worlds. When a world advances to a small world, at least one venerable sovereign will be born ... So it seems that there are more. There are indeed many first-stage venerable sovereigns, and they are the most common."p "The second is the second level. It's not difficult to reach the second level under normal circumstances. The first level is just a matter of time after wandering in the chaos for a few years, devouring some chaotic Qi, and perfecting your own cultivation system!"Li Hao nodded slightly.He could not help but ask,'venerable sovereigns ... Are divided into nine levels? That ... That neo martial human King is a ninth stage venerable sovereign?""No."Zu an shook his head,"it's only divided like this, but it doesn't mean that there really are!" The region we're currently in, in the primal Chaos, actually has a name, it's called the Crimson Moon region! Under normal circumstances, to make it easier to distinguish, we name the strongest world in the area as the domain!""The most powerful world here is the red moon world. It's said that the master of the red moon world is a rank eight venerable sovereign ... No one knows if it's true or not. It might be a legend, or it might be true!""As for the neo martial human King, he should be at the top of the seventh-rank. Otherwise, it would be difficult to kill the Master of Darkness!"Li Hao couldn't believe it. ""Neo martial human King ... Is not the strongest?"The red moon Lord was actually more powerful?"Also, they're not ninth-rank venerable sovereigns. I thought they were the most powerful venerable sovereigns!

Zu an laughed."To us, it makes no difference! Whether it's a tier 7 or a tier 9 ... We're far from being their match! Moreover, it's difficult for us to reach this level in our entire lives ... Of course, fellow Daoists who have just come out of this world don't quite understand that there's a huge gap between venerable sovereigns. ""There are at least two conditions to become a seventh level venerable sovereign. First, the world must have reached the level of a great world. Second, the great Dao must be perfected, or even grown to the peak! Then, he would become the master of the great Dao and the master of the world at the same time. Only then would he have the hope of becoming a seventh stage venerable sovereign! Just these ... We have no hope!"He shook his head slightly.Li Hao was a little dazed. He nodded."I see. Then, why does neo martial ... Want to attack the great world?""It's a long story. Neo martial and Crimson Moon should be the two strongest macro worlds in the Crimson Moon region. The Crimson Moon world prepared to attack and Annex neo martial decades ago, but the neo martial world retaliated ... Before the war with the Crimson Moon started, the result was a mess. The blissful and darkest macro worlds were annihilated. The neo martial human King probably did it on purpose. Knowing that he couldn't defeat the master of the Crimson Moon, he annexed the world and tried in vain to enter level eight!"Of course, he wasn't clear about the specific situation and was only guessing.He didn't continue on this topic, but pointed to the front and said,""The Hongyue region is not safe right now. A Great War has broken out and it is very chaotic! The Skylands world up ahead is a bit safer. Although it's chaotic here as well, it's been chaotic for so many years that it's become chaotic. There's more chaos here, and it's actually safer. "He explained to Li Hao,"in the past, it's best not to go. Venerable sovereigns often die Here. It's very dangerous." But now, in the battle of the red moon region, even a rank seven venerable sovereign is dead. At least, there won't be a battle of this level here ...""I've been in the Crimson Moon region for many years," he lamented."I'd thought that it would be safe there, but ... All of them suddenly went crazy and migrated the Dark Moon world without a word ... I almost died. The other worlds are the same. It's a mess. It's better for me to go to the Outlander world."Li Hao nodded.At this moment, he had a slight understanding of chaos, but it seemed like it was just a few words.Zu an saw him nod and smiled. He suddenly said,""But ... If possible, fellow Daoist li, it's best to stay far away from the tianfang world.",m "Why?""Didn't they say that it's safer?"Li Hao was puzzled."Relatively speaking!"Zu an explained,"that's for me. It's not because of my strength. It's because ... Fellow Daoist brought a Beast of Chaos with him. Moreover, fellow Daoist came from a small world. It's easy to think of one thing. Fellow Daoist ... Directly brought a small world out!""Yes," Li Hao nodded after a moment of surprise. Zu an smiled,'fellow Daoist probably doesn't understand the problem! Although a small world did not have a great Dao universe, the small world itself was a treasure. It could devour and strengthen itself! It can also be refined into a treasure, and that's also a Supreme treasure!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "When we're outside, medium worlds are actually fine with many experts. However, in small worlds, there's usually only one venerable sovereign. They'd wish they could hide the world in the depths of chaos so that no one can find it!""But if I carry it with me ... Even middle-level venerable sovereigns would be tempted. Of course, to high-level venerable sovereigns, a small world is not worth mentioning ..."Was it a crime to be in possession of a Jade?Li Hao nodded slightly and said,""But for venerable sovereigns, even if they devour all the small worlds, it'll probably be difficult for me, a first level venerable sovereign, to reach the third level, right?""Difficult!""Of course!" Zu an nodded and continued,"however, for some peak stage two experts, they might enter stage three after devouring them! As for the peak of rank three, if you devour it, you might have a chance of entering rank four ... Even if it's just a hope, it's a huge opportunity for many people!"Li Hao frowned slightly."Stage two and stage three. It shouldn't be difficult, right?"“……”Zu an glanced at him and laughed. Truly ... A newborn calf is not afraid of a Tiger!"It's not difficult for some people. Some of the Lords of small worlds didn't find it difficult at first! After all, who wouldn't have some pride to become a world Lord? However, the reality was that without a huge opportunity, there was still hope for a level one to become a level two ... After wandering in the chaos for more than a thousand years. It might take tens of thousands of years or even longer for a Tier 2 to become a Tier 3!""As for advancing from the 3rd rank to the 4th rank ... That's as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Without great luck, there's almost no hope! Unless your small world advances to a medium-level world, which is harder than cultivating on your own!""Or, by chance, you can join a great world. The Dao Lord of the great world will personally guide you into his great path universe and is willing to give you enough Dao domains. Only then will you have a chance of breaking through!""Or ... You can break through a great world, seize the great Dao universe, and become a Dao master yourself ...""In short, it's impossible to become a medium venerable sovereign without a great Dao universe! However, the great Dao universe is exclusive to the great world. This is a problem!"He shook his head and said,"therefore, the first, second, and third-tier ones who wander in the chaos are almost all venerable sovereigns from small and medium-sized worlds or chaos beasts! As for those above level three, they're either powerhouses from great worlds or have extremely great opportunities ... They've devoured small worlds or even medium worlds and obtained enough opportunities. Otherwise ... They can't break through. "

Chapter 2587 A Wild Horse Out Of Control (3 In 1)
So that was how it was!In that case, the universe of the great path was really special.Li Hao knew that the strong might not care about a small world.However, if he brought a Dao universe and two Dao universes ... Even a level six might care.He estimated that the Black Panther was only a rank two beast, and the red moon sovereign that he had killed before was probably a rank three beast. Since he had not undergone any transformation, Silver Moon still had a chance of defeating him.There was probably no hope for him to reach Tier 4!"Many thanks, senior!"Li Hao expressed his thanks, but zu an smiled and said,""There's no need for that. It's just some general knowledge that newbies don't understand. It's a chaotic Wanderer, everyone knows this. Moreover, you and I are both venerable sovereigns, so we are of the same generation. It's enough to call you fellow Daoist. Senior, your words are a joke!""Then ... I won't stand on ceremony. Thank you, fellow Daoist zu!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao said,"with your guidance, I've gained a better understanding of chaos. It can be considered a life-saving law. In that case, if I bring a Beast of Chaos, everyone will judge that I'm bringing a small world with me. I might attract the attention of some experts?""Under normal circumstances, a Tier 3 might target him. A Tier 4 ... A small world won't be of much use!"Zu an explained,"when they reach level four, a small world, and it's a newly-advanced one, won't be of much use to them. Of course, if some experts are narrow-minded, or if they are in urgent need of weapons, or if their descendants need to rely on the small world to advance, they may also try to seize it.""Then ... Why are you telling me this, senior? if ..." Li Hao nodded again.Zu an laughed."It's better to avoid unnecessary trouble. I'm only at the second rank. Even if I really wanted to, I might not be able to deal with this Beast of Chaos. Moreover, if I find someone else ... What does it have to do with me if I take it away? perhaps they'll kill me as well to avoid some trouble!"This was a normal situation.For example, if they found a level 4 martial artist and he killed Li Hao and seized the small world, if he was worried that trouble would arise ... Wouldn't it be best to kill zu an as well?He wouldn't give it to zu an anyway!A reminder might be able to make him a good friend, but the prerequisite was that the fellow before him knew how to be grateful.Besides, this person also said that there were some inheritances of neo martial arts in the bright moon world ... Who knew if they were related to neo martial arts? although neo martial arts was notorious, they were indeed very powerful. An existence like him who had conquered two major worlds in one day represented that on the neo martial world's side, the human king and emperor Cang should both be at the seventh rank, and they were not the weak kind.In addition, sun god, who was famous for neo martial arts, was able to escape from the hands of the red moon Lord. If he was not a seventh-rank, he must be at the peak of the sixth-rank. The Supreme of neo martial, a true sixth-grade.With so many powerhouses, if there was some connection between this side and the other side ... He couldn't afford to provoke them.He didn't need to tell Li Hao about this.As for Li Hao, the reason he said that he had a neo martial art was to avoid trouble. His Tao technique, including the ones from the Silvermoon, was actually very related to neo martial arts.It was easy for the strong to see through it. Rather than that, it was better to say it out. There were many new martial artists and many strong people. It was not a big deal to leave behind some inheritances after walking through a place.As long as no one knew that Silver Moon was a world born from a subsidiary of neo martial arts, it would be fine."Fellow Daoist zu, can you ... Tell me about the Grand celestial world in detail?"The Crimson Moon world, where a level eight venerable sovereign was in charge ... Li Hao felt that it was best for him to stay away from it. It was too dangerous."The Skylands world ..."Zu an smiled,"actually, we usually call the area ahead tianfang region. It's said that many years ago, the heavenly square region's world Lord advanced to rank nine venerable sovereign ... He was extremely powerful and swept through the chaos!""However, it's just a legend ... Later, it's said that something happened. This world Lord suddenly took the people of tianfang world and left this place. The great path universe might have been taken away with him, or it might have been destroyed, leaving only a world behind.""After all, it's a macro world and it's extremely powerful. Later, many chaos wandered and took root here, treating it as a habitat in the chaos. Gradually, more and more chaos wandered and took root in the tianfang world!""Some simply stay behind, while others pass by and Exchange Daoist techniques or trade some treasures ... It's used as a market for cultivators! The Skylands world is one of the most valuable places in the eyes of the primordial chaos!""There are also many experts from shattered worlds gathered here. There are also some weaklings ...""Some worlds are destroyed or devoured when they are in danger. Not all of them are dead. Some people can still survive and choose a new place to live.""For example, this time, the Elysian world and the darkglow world were destroyed. Someone must have escaped, and their first choice must be the tianfang world!""Yes," zu an continued."A few years ago, many worlds in the Crimson Moon region were actually annihilated. A portion of the people who survived would definitely escape ..."Li Hao understood."So that's how it is. The tianfang world is The Drifters 'dwelling place. No one cares about it, right?""No one cares, but because of this, it's too chaotic! "Some of the nearby experts will also go. Those with good personalities will go take a look and make a deal. Those with bad personalities ... Will directly snatch you. This is normal!""It's not like a normal great world where the world Lord is in charge. Who would dare to be impudent with a rank seven existence? "In this world, you're the host. Ordinary Tier-7 cultivators wouldn't dare to cause any trouble. But in the Outlander grand world, there's no such thing. There's only chaos!"

Chapter 2588 A Wild Horse Out Of Control (3 In 1)_6
Li Hao nodded and roughly understood the situation.In front of him was the territory of the chaos Rangers. It was a no man's land, but it was still dangerous."So no one is devouring the Outlander world?"Li Hao suddenly asked,"according to you, tianfang world is the world of a level nine venerable Emperor. The Lord of the World may have died or left. Why hasn't anyone devoured it?"Wasn't this thing more fragrant than a small world?"Why not?"Zu an shook his head."Yes, and many people have tried it ... However, although the tianfang world doesn't have a great Dao universe or a world Lord, it's still extremely strong! It could even withstand the battle of a seventh or eighth level venerable sovereign ... Anyone below the seventh level could forget about destroying this world! "As for seventh rank venerable sovereigns and above ... I don't know about that. We've also wondered why no major cosmos absolute beings have devoured them. Maybe there's something special about a rank nine world, so the Lord of a major world nearby doesn't dare to devour it ... Or maybe the owner of the Outlander world is still alive, but we don't know about it. "Was it?Li Hao thought that if the new martial artist King went ... He might not care even if he was still alive. Of course, swallowing a world without a great Dao universe might not bring many benefits.After weighing the pros and cons, the neo martial human King might not necessarily devour this world.Also, the neo martial human King was not the strongest in the chaos ...What a pity!I thought he was the number one in the chaos.That overbearing...For those who don't know, do you really think that you're invincible in the primordial chaos? you told me that killing the number one expert in the primordial chaos was just for fun. I really thought that you were tier 9.Li Hao cursed in his heart, but he didn't say it out loud.,m I'm just a rank one shrimp, so don't say such things.Li Hao was comforted by a rather friendly chaos Ranger. He asked again,""Fellow Daoist, other than devouring worlds, are there any other opportunities in the chaos for weaklings like us to advance in rank?""There is!"Zu an laughed,"didn't I already tell you?" Join a macro world and cultivate the macro world Dao. The great Dao of a macro world is much stronger than ours. We either cultivate the chaotic great Dao that already exists in the chaos or the Dao of chaos. It sounds good, but in fact, it's chaotic and disorderly. Just sorting it out will make you crazy!""Otherwise, you can cultivate the Dao of some radiated large worlds ... For example, in the Crimson Moon Area, many small worlds are actually radiated by the Crimson Moon world. You can cultivate it too, but when you become a great Dao Emperor, you will definitely attract the attention of the entire great Dao. If the other party is in a good mood, he will take you in as a follower. If he is in a bad mood, it is normal to kill you directly!"Li Hao understood this. Back then, the Silver Moon people had actually cultivated the origin Dao.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  It was the radiating origin Dao!To become a divine Emperor, one still had to undergo tribulation.It was also a catastrophe created by neo martial!Without a Dao universe, one could only live under someone else's roof. Otherwise, one wouldn't even have the hope of corroborating the Dao and becoming an Emperor."But I've heard from some ancient books of neo martial arts that if there is no universe with the great Dao, one can create a new world by themselves ..." Li Hao couldn't help but say. Zu an was speechless.After a long while, he said,"this is also a method ... But it's better not to say it!" Opening a new Sky, opening a new world ... This ... Do you know how much ability is needed to do this? It's not something an ordinary venerable sovereign can do!"Was it?Then, the river of time that I created, the river of life and death now, can it be considered?Even Li Hao is not confident, but I have indeed become a venerable Emperor."Not everyone can drive it?"“……”Nonsense!Young man, you're so ambitious.Zu an explained,"it's not just a random land or sky. It's not a new world. It's a new world!" The so-called creation of heaven and earth was based on the perfection of the Dao teachings, the natural Dao sequence, the ability to live, to survive, to solidify the Dao, and even ... The chaos lightning tribulation! Let's not talk about anything else, but the last point is that once the chaos lightning tribulation comes, whatever heaven and earth, whatever world, whatever it is, will be randomly opened up and you will be struck to death!"He felt that Li Hao didn't understand this, so he explained,""Chaos lightning tribulations...The Tribulation that marks the birth of the primordial chaos! Once they came, they were basically waiting for death! For example, if you were a first stage venerable sovereign, the lightning tribulation you would encounter would be able to kill a second stage venerable sovereign at the very least! And I can't let anyone else take the primal Chaos lightning tribulation for me ..."Li Hao thought to himself, sure. For example, second cat could be eaten. For example, when I became God's will, I could actually be stopped.Of course, under normal circumstances, there wouldn't be many second cats.As for becoming the Heaven's Will ... It represents that all existences in the world should be weaker than you and should not be able to stop you.As for Dali King and the Queen, they had helped him once previously because they were also good at being struck. One was half a day's will while the other was using her past body. Both of them had something to do with time. It was not an injustice for them to be struck!"So that's how it is. I thought that I could open up a new world at any time!"Li Hao had a regretful look on his face, while zu an smiled without saying anything."When everyone knows this, they probably fantasize that I can do it too.They were all venerable sovereigns, so who didn't have some pride?But ... The truth will tell you, don't think blindly, so what if you are a venerable sovereign!The chaosverse had no lack of emperors.However, how many people could open up a new world?He didn't know anyway.With such a method of advancement, it would be better to find a great world and rely on it. Perhaps with good luck, he could also become a top venerable sovereign.

Chapter 2589 A Wild Horse Out Of Control (3 In 1)
He regained some confidence in front of this newcomer. While healing his injuries, zu an told Li Hao about what he had seen and heard.The Black Panther also continued to swim slowly.Along the way, other than zu an, they didn't even see a ghost's shadow.And just like that, after traveling for close to a month, zu an didn't stay any longer. His injuries had also healed, and he directly bade farewell."Daoist Li, I'll go to the Skylands world first. You'd better find a place to hide the world or let this Chaos Beast stay behind ... Otherwise, the Skylands world is very chaotic. If you take this beast with you, and you've only just entered stage one ... It'll be too dangerous! Also, the tianfang world doesn't really welcome chaos beasts. These beings like to devour things randomly, which is very troublesome!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "To the North of this place, 10000 Primal Chaos iron rods, and that's the Outlander world! The primal Chaos iron ruler is a first level venerable sovereign. If you go all out, you can move a distance once. If you move ten thousand times, you'll be in the tianfang world!"Li Hao was speechless. It was quite far!It would take at least a few days, and they were going all out to travel. The chaos was indeed unimaginably huge.And this was the world closest to the Crimson Moon."Many thanks, fellow Daoist zu!"Li Hao thanked him again."I'll go to the tianfang world after I've settled the world. If I'm lucky, I might meet you. I'll have to trouble you again!"Zu an laughed,"I can deal with small matters. As for big matters ... I can't do anything either! Finally, I'd like to give fellow Daoist a piece of advice ... When you're out, it's best not to say that you have any involvement with neo martial arts! "There are too many lunatics in neo martial's yin-yang world and it has a bad reputation. Over the years, many worlds have been destroyed. Some people have escaped to the tianfang world, and there may even be fifth or sixth stage venerable sovereigns among them ... Even if you have only obtained some superficial inheritance, it is possible that those people can't do anything to neo martial and might attack you!"Li Hao nodded,"of course! Many thanks for fellow Daoist's reminder. ""You're welcome!"Zu an was also a veteran chaos Ranger, so he wasn't reluctant to leave. They were just travelling together, and he had told Li Hao a lot of information. He wanted to use Li Hao's place to heal his wounds, so they were even.At this moment, he didn't say anything more and quickly flew away.He couldn't stay in the red moon region any longer, so he went to Tian Fang to find an opportunity.After they left, Li Hao was silent for a while.Can't I bring Heibao over?Now that Lin Hongyu and the others were working hard to advance to venerable sovereign, should he wait a little longer or go and explore first?Would it be safe to leave Silvermoon in the chaosverse?It was not the same thing to wander in the chaos all the time. He had to come into contact with the outside world and Exchange mantras with others. It was better than wandering in the chaos. Otherwise, he would not have any chance to improve himself."A neo martial human King can kill a seventh stage venerable sovereign, and I'm the weakest of the first stage ... According to what zu an said, even if I wander in chaos until I die of old age, I still have no hope of entering the seventh stage ..." Li Hao turned his head to look. He still had to go back.Red Moon master might be a rank eight venerable sovereign!This time, the neo martial human King and the Supreme martial artist might have their own considerations when they destroyed the two worlds ... But in Li Hao's eyes, they were indeed doing it for Silver Moon and for him to open a Stargate to attract the attention of others.If it was not for the new martial arts, perhaps more experts from the red moon would have come that day, and even the red moon master might have come."I still have to return to the red moon region ... But the prerequisite is that I have to have sufficient strength!"In the distance was the famous Wanderer world in the primal Chaos, the tianfang great world.As for chaos ... That was good, wasn't it?If everything was in order, where would they get the chance?A moment later, Li Hao made a decision.Heibao and the others would find a place to hide first, while he would go to the tianfang world to take a look. He would wait until Lin Hongyu and the others advanced to venerable sovereigns. Of course, Lin Hongyu would need his help to advance.At this moment, she was still building up her Foundation, so she was not in a hurry.Having made his decision, Li Hao hesitated no more.After saying goodbye to Black Panther and sending a message to several experts, Li Hao chose to leave ...
