        artial uncle!"
         “……”
         Hong Yitang was speechless. Our relationship ... Has it reached this stage?
         "I also have the heart to apologize. I broke martial uncle's earth overturning sword, and I'm very sorry for not cherishing it."
         Hong Yitang couldn't help but laugh."It's a small matter. Besides, I gave it to you. It's already yours."
         At this moment, Hong Qing was surprised. The earth overturning sword is very sturdy and very powerful. How could it be damaged?"
         Li Hao laughed."I broke it when I was killing people. Two days ago, someone tried to kill me, so I killed them. In the end, I accidentally broke it."
         Hong Qing still couldn't believe it. "But ... That sword is very powerful. Did someone change your sword?"
         She still couldn't react.
         On the other hand, Madam Hong's eyes flickered slightly as she looked at Hong Yitang. Hong Yitang nodded slightly.
          Madam Hong's eyes were filled with shock!
         She finally understood!
         Li Hao ... Was the murderer who killed Yu Xiao and the others that day.
         He couldn't believe it!
         She was all too clear about the earth overturning sword. It was absolutely impossible for it to shatter without erupting with an incomparably powerful force.
         Li Hao ... Had he already reached this stage?
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was very hungry. After eating, he was about to speak when Hong Qing suddenly said,""Did you get attacked again? Why are you covered in blood? and your ears ... Why ..."
         "No, I practiced martial arts."
         Hong Qing was speechless."How did you become like this when you practiced martial arts?"
         Li Hao smiled and looked at Hong Yitang."Uncle-master, I've come to ask you about some things."
         One wouldn't come to the temple without a reason!
         Hong Yitang understood and smiled,""Tell me, what could be difficult for you, Li Hao?"
         Li Hao thought for a moment and said, does the extreme speed of all things mean that it has a stronger explosive power?
         "No."
         Li Hao was stunned.
         It wasn 't?  Hong Yitang laughed,'it's not fast, it's explosive! "You're also a scholar. You should understand that explosive force is actually related to the increase in your speed, which is also the so-called acceleration. In this process, you will accumulate energy and momentum, which is the factor of a strong explosive force!"
         "To put it simply, you need to constantly burst out, constantly increase your speed, and increase the impact force. In this process, you need to increase your speed and not be constant. Only then can you burst out with more powerful strength!"
         "Yes, that's true!" Li Hao nodded.
         After saying that, Li Hao continued,"so, the power that you burst out with was actually the power that you had accumulated in the middle. It was still your own power. It's just that, like the ninth-refinement force, it's also a rapid stacking process, right?"
         "You know it yourself. Do you still need to ask?"
         Hong Yitang didn't quite understand what Li Hao wanted to do, but he didn't mind having a chat with him.
         Li Hao understood now. He mumbled,"so, it's actually a process of storing power. It's just that this process is cut into pieces. In the end, a type of power will burst out, right?"
         "It can be considered so."
         Hong Yitang thought for a moment."The ancients also said that there's a way to accumulate power. It's just that the problem you're talking about is a type of dynamic accumulation. It's easier and faster. In fact, the ancient people also had a static sense of storing power, which is to hold your breath and explode at the critical moment ..."
         Li Hao was enlightened again.
         He also knew ancient books, and with this, he had a better understanding of the flying bird technique.
         However, Li Hao still had some difficulties."When you turn around or counterattack, this momentum will be cut off. Unless you keep chasing, which means you're stronger than your opponent. But when you encounter such a problem, you can't accumulate momentum. What do you do?"
         Hong Yitang laughed."You shouldn't ask me about this. You should ask your teacher ... Not Yuan Shuo, but your culture teacher. Have you ever learned how to curve?" Who told you that the highest point of the parabola is the fastest and most explosive?"
         "Do you have to move in a straight line when you exercise? Parabola didn't work? The curves won't do?"
         Li Hao blinked and looked at Hong Yitang. Good Lord, you're giving me a physics class?
          Hong Yitang drank a cup of tea. Ignoring the surprised looks of his daughter and wife, he looked at Li Hao, thought for a while, and said,""Whether it's pursuit or escape, it doesn't necessarily have to be in a straight line. Just like how an Eagle swooped down to hunt, it's not actually in a straight line because the prey can run. In the process, it constantly adjusted its direction."
         Li Hao nodded, deep in thought.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He ate a few more mouthfuls of food, and some of his doubts from before were somewhat explained.
         After thinking for a while, Li Hao said, how can this extreme speed be transformed into momentum? It's turned into divine intent ..."
         Hong Yitang looked at him in surprise. Turn into divine intent?
         Was this guy trying to comprehend another kind of force?
         After a moment of silence, he spoke again,"among the Seven Swords, the Azure light sword is the fastest, as fast as light!" I can't tell you how you comprehended it, so I'll tell you how the Azure light sword was made, and you can use it as a reference. "
         "When the aquamarine light sword strikes, there is actually a short process of storing power. Therefore, when she strikes, before she strikes, it is the best opportunity to kill her, because she will have a short pause, and in an instant, the sword will strike, and the instantaneous explosion will be extremely powerful!"
         "To put it simply, the drawing of the sword is slow, but the drawing of the sword is fast! The sword fell even faster! At this time, it is a test of the strength of the arm and wrist, as well as the reasonable flow of inner strength. The Azure light sword has been used like this for many years, and in the end, I have naturally comprehended her Azure light sword force. "
         "Sometimes, sword momentum depends on talent, but sometimes it also depends on the degree of effort. If you can't swing your sword ten thousand times, then you'll swing it a hundred thousand times. If a hundred thousand times doesn't work, then a million times ... The swing of the sword is momentum!"
        
         The sword was momentum?
         Li Hao pondered, and sword techniques appeared in his mind. He continuously attacked, faster and faster, extremely fast, and exploded in an instant ...
         It exploded!
         It was as resplendent as fireworks!
         Yes, fireworks ...
         Lift up, accelerate, explode!
         It instantly burst out with light.
         Li Hao looked at Hong Yitang and said,""Is the aquamarine light sword somewhat similar to the explosion of fireworks?"
         Ordinary people wouldn't be able to keep up with his jumping thinking. Hong Yitang didn't mind. He thought for a while and nodded. "It's similar! Now that you've put it that way, I think it's very similar. When fireworks rise into the sky, they also need to ignite and accumulate power, and the gunpowder needs to be ignited to create power ... Only then can they burst out with brilliance, and the process of accumulating power!"
         Li Hao understood."I understand!"
          "That's good. "
         Hong Qing and Mrs. Hong were both dumbfounded by their conversation.
         What should I say?
         One moment it was fireworks, the next moment it was a parabola, and then it was this and that. She couldn't understand the core of their conversation at all.
         In fact, the core of the two was very simple. They were extremely fast, fast to the point of explosiveness, and explosiveness into momentum ...
         In fact, they had been talking about this problem.
         Li Hao knew that Hong Yitang could understand him. Sure enough, Hong Yitang could understand what he meant. But if he told this to other people, they would only tell him that it was nonsense!
         Li Hao took a deep breath. He already had some understanding, but this Shi required some time and practice. It couldn't be formed in an instant.
         He didn't continue with this and said,""Uncle-master, I want to see the earth overturning sword."
         "I don't even practice swordsmanship anymore ..." Hong Yitang smiled."Of course, if you're interested, I can teach you."
         "No, I'm not teaching!"
         Li Hao shook his head."Of course, I'm not in a hurry. I need to absorb and digest what I've learned today. Uncle-master, I'm serious. I want to find time to spar with master. Whether it's a life-and-death battle or an all-out fight, if I can hold back, uncle-master will. If I can't ... It doesn't matter. I want to see the earth overturning sword!"
         On the side, Hong Qing and Madam Hong both frowned, even a little annoyed.
         Was this a challenge?
         A Martial master's challenge?
         Back then, Li Hao's teacher had challenged him as well, but Hong Yitang had still been a Martial Master.
         "No." Hong Yitang smiled.
         “……”
         Li Hao was very depressed and driven mad. He really wanted to see the Earthcover sword.  It was true!
         Even if he was injured or even killed, it didn't matter.
         Yes, it didn't matter.
         Weren't there only a few ways for a Martial Master to return?
         They would either die at the hands of stronger experts, or die of old age and illness.
         Or ... To walk to the end and become invincible!
         Which Martial Master didn't think of death when they attacked?
         Therefore, if he died in a spar, it would mean that he was not as good as his opponent. He could really accept this method.
         Hong Yitang saw that he was depressed and laughed,'I'm a super now, not a Martial Master! The Martial master's rules are useless to me. Even if they are useful ... I'm just an early stage three yang, I'm not your opponent, so why bother?"
         Li Hao gently exhaled and stopped talking about this. He thought for a moment and said,""Uncle-master, do you have any disciples who have broken through 100? The kind that comprehended the earth overturning sword?"
         "No, I didn 't,"
         "No." Hong Yitang shook his head."My most powerful disciple is my daughter. She's in the late-stage of the breakthrough 100."
         Hong Qing rolled his eyes.
         He glanced at his stepmother ... Forget it, I can't be bothered to say it. I'm not your most powerful disciple. Of course, I'm your wife now.
         "I joined the Wei Wu Army," Li Hao suddenly said."Also, Minister hou asked me to build a 100-man army on my own. The benefits are excellent! A warrior master of thousand Warriors, a basic salary of twelve divine power stones a year, one attempt to comprehend the Shi left behind by the ancient people once every three months, two attempts a year to break through the late 100 stage ..."
         Hong Yitang was slightly stunned.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao said again, I'll give you all the mysterious things. "Joining the Wei Wu Army also means that you have formed a system with the night patrollers. Moreover, you have fewer restrictions than the night patrollers because the Wei Wu Army only needs to listen to me. As for the thousand-man golden spear, I can speak to it. I don't need my subordinates to come into contact with it ..."
         "In other words, I can make the decision. Whoever I say is righteous is righteous!"
          Hong Yitang glanced at Li Hao and then at him.
         Li Hao laughed."Swords gate has the black banner. I don't think it is of much use. I don't have it and the new army needs it too. I will convince the Wei Wu Army to buy it with treasures!" On the Wei Wu Army's side, golden spear senior felt that he was a gentleman Martial Master. A gentleman ... Could be deceived! The Marquis is not here these few days, so golden spear senior can make his own decision. Hei Teng will definitely buy it!"
         Hong Yitang's mouth opened slightly.
         Li Hao continued,"take in a part of you. Not all of you. How about this? a part of you will join the Wei Wu Army. You will be part of the Army, not just the swords gate."
         Hong Yitang laughed!
         He laughed helplessly and suspiciously,""You ... Aren't you afraid of hou Xiaochen?"
         Did this mean that hou Xiaochen's plan had been foiled?
         However, Li Hao shook his head,"Minister hou just wants to avoid more trouble, he doesn't really care about swords gate's strength!" Perhaps, I can only take a fancy to the Earthcover sword, and the rest ... Actually doesn't matter!"
         "Heigui has joined the Wei Wu Army, and the swords gate has sent people to join. The earth-covered sword has shown their attitude. If they send their daughter to the Wei Wu Army, their attitude will be even clearer. The Marquis should understand that a powerful swordsman would rather break than bend. This is the best choice!"
         "I'm not a powerful swordsman," Hong Yitang said with a smile."I'm not as powerful as you."
        
         Li Hao didn't care about this. He thought for a while and continued,"Swords gate is a sword sect, and I am also a swordsman. Since the earth-covered sword is not willing to use the earth-covered sword anymore ... Maybe it will be helpful if some of the swords gate's martial masters join me, a swordsman.
         "It's a win-win situation, I guess!"
         "With Silver moon's attention and the hou tribe's power being revealed, the swords gate's living space is being compressed. Some of Silver moon's things can not be easily touched. Otherwise, not just the Marquis, but some other people will be dissatisfied. "
         "Martial uncle, do you think that hou bu is the number one person in Silver Moon?" he asked Hong Yitang softly.
         Hong Qing and the others were dumbfounded.
         Was it not?
         Killing a sunguang with a single spear strike wasn't the first person?
         He would be a top-tier existence in the central continent, right?
         Hong Yitang couldn't stop laughing."Is this a coincidence or fate? It just so happens that our swords gate has the intention to get close to the night patrolmen, and we were given 100 Black banners. You are also a swordsman, and you came to find me at this time. Everything is so coincidental ... I don't think I have any reason to say no?"
          Li Hao suddenly laughed and said,"yes, it's destined!" In addition, martial uncle doesn't seem surprised that golden spear senior is in the Wei Wu Army?"
         "What's there to be surprised about?"
         Hong Yitang laughed,"actually, it's quite good. It's quite suitable for him!" Jin gun ... It's hard to say. Actually, people who use guns are generally upright people! He was straight, and his spear was straight! There was no regret when the spear shot out, and it advanced forward with an indomitable will! The spear is more upright than the sword!"
         "Spear experts aren't all good people. Most of them are!"
         "The Golden spear is the first spear of the Silver Moon. Back then, we felt that he should join the army. Now, we can only say that it is in line with his wishes. If he joins the Wei Wu Army, he will definitely become stronger. The way of the spear doesn't need to be special. As long as he is filled with righteousness, the way of the spear will only become stronger!"
         This was Hong Yitang's evaluation of the Golden spear.
         Li Hao nodded after hearing this. He wasn't familiar with the Golden spear, but since Hong Yitang said so, he must have some understanding of it.
         "Martial Master," Hong Yitang said,"swords gate doesn't have many martial masters. Do you want all of them, or only those who have broken through the hundred States?"
         "I want both. In this era, it's not difficult to break through Ten Realms and break through a hundred! It was not difficult to break through the later stage of 100. The difficulty lay in comprehending force! Those who can be accepted by uncle master are not bad, but they can't become supers. "
         Hong Yitang thought for a while and nodded,"okay, twenty people in the tenth realm and ten people above the hundred. This is all the martial masters that swords gate can use now. The tenth realm is not the first level, so it shouldn't be too hard to break through the hundred."
         30 people!
         Hong Qing and the others were dumbfounded.  "Dad, we ... We ..." Hong Qing could not help but say.
         He agreed to it just like that?
         With just a few words, all of them had been sold out by their own father?
         Sold to the Wei Wu Army, sold to Li Hao?
         No conditions?
         He might as well sell it to hou Xiaochen!
         Hong Yitang laughed and said,"what's the hurry? it's pretty good!" Only by joining the Wei Wu Army will you have a chance to comprehend force and enter the Qianqian class ... I've always been reluctant to part with you, but as a Martial Master, I can't be reluctant!"
         "I can't bear to see you fight with others, I can't bear to see you fight to the death with others, I can't bear to see you leave ... However, the young Eagle has grown up and it's time for it to learn how to fly by itself. I'll keep you by my side for the rest of my life ... Times are different now!"
         He sighed with emotion. Times were different now, and the Earthcover sword was no longer the super-strong swordsman who was famous in Silver Moon!
         At this moment, Li Hao ignored Hong Qing and said telepathically,""Uncle-master, there seems to be a lot of disadvantages to becoming a Martial Master! It seemed troublesome to completely abandon the mysterious energy, but the key was that the Super-Martial Master had a huge impact on his internal organs, which were not strong enough to withstand it! We still have to break the five internal organs Super Lock ..."
         Hong Yitang raised his eyebrows slightly.
          "Uncle-master had already broken through 100 perfection years ago. He has been like this since decades ago. Entering the superpower realm is the sunshine. Three suns shouldn't be too difficult. Martial masters must have many super locks that can be discovered ... So ... Unless uncle-master has been strengthening the Super Lock! Powerful five organs! It's to prevent the backlash ... Perhaps your five organs Super Lock has reached its limit. "
         "After breaking four shackles, one will have three yang. If you break another of the five internal organs, it'll be sunguang ... You might have broken the Super locks on your limbs, but your attribute doesn't seem to be clear. Is it fire, metal, or earth ... I've seen you attack a few times, and there were some traces, but it seems to be earth to the outside world ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He didn't make sense, but Hong Yitang kept raising his eyebrows. After a while, he sent a message."Li Hao, I'm old, so I don't quite understand what you mean."
         Li Hao grinned and transmitted his voice again, that's fine, but the blood God's clones are really helpful in strengthening the five internal organs! Martial uncle might not have noticed it before, but I suspect that Ying Hongyue is using this method to walk his path. She strengthened her five internal organs and strengthened the five internal organs 'Super Lock in preparation for returning to the realm of Martial Master. "
         "The blood God is really extraordinary!"
         Hong Yitang fell into deep thought.
         Li Hao continued."Uncle-master, don't worry. Leave your disciples to me. I won't harm them ... However, Crimson Moon experts are now in high demand. If you have any ideas, you should do it as soon as possible. Otherwise, they'll be snatched away!"
         Hong Yitang glanced at him and laughed.
         He didn't continue the conversation and picked up his teacup,""Then, Li Hao, I'll have to trouble you to take care of Hong Qing and the others in the future! "I will get them to report to you very soon. Give the Wei Wu Army as many benefits as they can get from the 100 Black Vatican. It doesn't matter how much."
        
         Li Hao also raised his teacup and said with a smile,""Alright, thank you for your support, uncle!"
         "You're welcome!"
         The two of them drank the tea in one gulp, as if they were drinking wine.
         At this moment, Hong Qing was completely speechless.
         It's ... Over?
         What was his father thinking?
         Also, what was Li Hao thinking?
         "When martial uncle feels that I'm worthy of drawing your sword, you can come and find me at any time ..."
         Li Hao stood up and smiled."Now, I have two swords of fire and earth. Soon, I'll go and condense the golden sword. The water sword is also in my consideration." As for the wooden sword, I don't have much of a clue yet. When I master the five swords, I hope that overlayed sword will not be stingy in teaching me!"
         Then, Li Hao opened the door and disappeared from the room in the blink of an eye.
          In the private room.
         Hong Yitang frowned slightly.
         The fire and earth swords had been formed. Was the so-called extreme explosion today the golden sword?
         The water sword ... Evolved from the ninth form of the force?
         Five elements sword!
         Five birds technique!
         At this moment, he had a vague understanding.
         Five birds technique, fuse five spirits.
         When Li Hao killed Yu Xiao and the others, did he form the second sword?
         If he could kill a middle stage three yang cultivator with two swords, wouldn't he be able to kill a late stage three yang cultivator with three swords? Or even peak three yang?
         What about the fourth and fifth sword?
         [He really thinks highly of me. He even wants me to go to him after refining five swords ... And kill me like I'm the rising sun?]
         Hong Yitang laughed, and his daughter's anxious voice came to his ear,""Dad, what are you thinking about? Why did you agree to send us to the Wei Wu Army?"
         "It's pretty good!"
         Hong Yitang laughed,"the Wei Wu Army is safer than the swords gate. There's also a chance to gain experience and gain benefits. It's killing two birds with one stone. It's good!"
         Seeing his wife looking at him with some worry, he said,""It's fine. Li Hao ... Is a good person!"
         "Yitang, why don't I go too ..."
         "You're a superhuman, where can you go?"
         Hong Yitang shook his head and said,"you should stay in swords gate. I might need to go into closed door cultivation for a while to think about some problems. I will only come out after a few days. Without you here, who will be in charge of swords gate?"
         "Closed-door training?"
         "Yes."
         Hong Yitang nodded and looked out of the window. The window was facing south, and his eyes were a little dazed. South ... South!
         If they went all the way South, they would reach the North Sea. After that, they would reach the central region.
         Yuan Shuo might be in the North Sea or even the central region.
         Ying Hongyue and the others were all here.
         BA Dao, sky sword ...
         Silver moon's people really had a wide network.
         Silver moon's martial masters were outstanding talents wherever they went.
         Unfortunately, the world no longer had the name of self-covering sword.
         After finishing the last cup of tea, he stood up and said,"that's it then. Hongxiu, you stay here first. When Qing 'er and the others enter the Wei Wu Army, you can bring the other disciples back. I'll go back first to settle some small matters and then go into seclusion. When I come out, I'll come back to see Qing' er."
         "Dad ..."
         "It's settled then. I still have things to do, so I'll be leaving first!"
         After saying that, Hong Yitang left. Hong Qing was speechless and grumbled. Li Hao came, but she suddenly became a Wei Wu Army soldier. Her father also left in a hurry. She was still confused!
         ……
         Hong Yitang drove away quickly.
          Yes, he was driving.  The car was driving very, very fast, and it didn't take long for them to leave the South City.
         He kept moving forward!
         When they were out of the White moon City, the car turned left and right, but it didn't head towards swords gate.
         He didn't stop the car until they arrived at a large Manor.
         He stood outside the door and looked inside. It was empty, as if no one was there.
         Hong Yitang frowned slightly and sensed for a while. After a while, he suddenly spat,"“艹!”
         He cursed!
         He didn't know who to scold.
         After a while, he got into his car and drove away. This time, he was heading towards swords gate.
         In the car, he cursed again. What a waste of time, they left so quickly.
         Why did the second generation Blue Moon Run away?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Someone from my sect clearly saw them.
         How F * cked up!
         Was the effect of the blood God's clone really that good?
         I really don't know how useful a sunrise-grade one is ... What a pity!
         It was mainly because he didn't pay much attention to it before. When he did, he was looking for Hong Yue's people everywhere, and he didn't have the chance to find them.
         Hong Yitang cursed in his heart. He was too late.
         Otherwise, he could take a sunguang-level Blood God and see its effects. If the effects were good ... Forget it, it should be good. Li Hao strengthened his five internal organs, and now his three sword strikes were about to take shape. It must have a very good effect.
         Yuan Shuo's fusion of the five Forces was also related to the blood God.
         Yup, Ying Hongyue was also doing it ...
         If everyone was doing it and said it was good, then it must be really good.
         "What a pity. How did the second generation Blue Moon leave so quickly?"
         He still had some regrets. He didn't want to think about it anymore and went back first!
         He was still a step too late.
         Hong Yitang sighed. He could only go into seclusion then. He didn't know if it would be too late to get some blood deities.
         As for Li Hao's probing words ... He couldn't be bothered with them.
         I didn't even respond to your master's challenge, let alone you?
         Even if you really succeed in five strikes, I won't bother with you.
         ……
         At the same time.
         In another Manor.
         "Master Blue Moon, someone just went to our previous base," one of the grimace-masked men said carefully.
         LAN Yue wasn't surprised and casually asked,""Night patrolman?"
         "No, I think it's the swords gate's headmaster."
          "Earth overturning sword?"
         LAN Yue was slightly stunned and smiled,'could it be ... You want to join us? Swords gate is stuck between the night patrollers and our three major organizations, and it is difficult for us to maintain our relationship. Unfortunately, he's no longer the powerful earth overturning sword from back then. He's at the initial stage of the three yang realm ... He's a figure here, but he's really nothing in the central region. "
         Shaking his head, he was not too interested in paying attention to it.
         He would only consider it if the other party brought the black Phoenix.
         He didn't even bother to meet him. If the other party was sunguang or someone at the peak of the three yang realm, it would be worth it. As for now ... He had to be careful in case hou Xiaochen found out.
         Thinking that he didn't need to see the earth, he suddenly felt enlightened, and some of the gloominess he had been suppressing disappeared.
         LAN Yue smiled. As expected, following one's heart was only natural.
         If he had gone to see the earth overturning sword, he might have felt uncomfortable.
         With that in mind, he stopped thinking about it. It didn't matter that the earth overturning sword had found his previous hiding place. He didn't hide his tracks for a few days. He even wanted to lure hou Xiaochen over, but Hu Qingfeng changed his mind. He gave up on that plan and quickly left.
         [PS: first watch today, Third Watch tomorrow.]
        
         After leaving the swords Gate office, Li Hao didn't return to the Wei Wu Army. Instead, he headed to the headquarters of the Nightwatchers.
         In his heart, he was still thinking about what Hong Yitang had said.
         The earth overturning sword was really crippled?
         He didn't believe it.
         He had tried to probe Hong Yitang several times. Although this old fox was watertight, he was not afraid to answer some questions about martial arts. Li Hao couldn't figure out his situation for a while.
         If he wanted to hide, why not just keep quiet and pretend to be deaf?
         Thinking back to his performance in the remains, this person seemed to be in great danger and almost died a few times, but the actual situation was ... Nothing. In the end, he came out safely, although he was a little embarrassed.
         "Silvermoon has quite a few hidden experts, but ... Why?"
         At this moment, Li Hao fell into deep thought.
         Silver Moon had so many powerful characters, so why did he choose to hide them?
          Could it be that there were too many experts in the central continent, far more than them?
         There must be a reason. Otherwise, why would they hide their strength for no reason just to pretend to be pigs to eat Tigers?
         As a Martial Master, Li Hao clearly knew that if you kept hiding your strength and didn't fight for a long time, you might become a real pig, even if you had a high realm and great strength.
         He understood the logic, but these powerhouses who had experienced the turmoil of the Silver Moon did not understand it?
         As for the sake of rebelling ... Rebelling required strength!
         All of them were hiding. Who would think highly of you among the Dukes of the world?
         The people will think highly of you?
         The superpowers will think highly of you?
         Even if it was a rebellion, it shouldn't be like this. With so many experts, at least a few of them should have made a move early to make a name for themselves.
         Li Hao shook his head slightly.
         Forget it, it has nothing to do with me.
         On his face, he revealed a smile.
         At least it wasn't a wasted trip.
         Not only did he confirm some of his ideas, but he also gained a lot of benefits from swords gate-100 Black banners and 30 martial masters.
         The entire Wei Wu Army only had about 500 black hou.
         This also meant that almost half of the Wei Wu Army did not have Black Phoenix.
         He was full all of a sudden!
         Of course, even if swords gate handed over the Wei Wu Army, they might not give him the entire Army ... But Li Hao would never let that happen.
         ……
         "Why did you come back?"
         Steward Yu frowned. This guy had only left for a morning, and he returned so quickly.
         Also, who was he sparring with?
         Golden spear?
         It was also possible.
          The Golden spear was not around yesterday, but it was probably back today. Even the forest trees were unable to harm Li Hao. In the entire Wei Wu Army, only the Golden spear had the ability to do so.  Li Hao scratched his head and said helplessly,"Mu Lin asked me to form a 100-man team for the Wei Wu Army, but I don't know anything. Plus, I'm poor and have no reputation. Even if I do, it's the bad reputation left behind by my master. I have enemies everywhere. How can I recruit people?"
         “……”
         Chief Steward Yu was speechless. It was true. It was indeed very difficult for Li Hao.
         This was also a test of Li Hao's ability.
         However, if he succeeded, it would be of great help to Li Hao. Martial masters could be independent, but if he had no friends or connections, he could become the next Yuan Shuo with enemies everywhere.
         "Then ... What do you want from me?"
         Chief Steward Yu understood that he had come to ask for help.
         She faintly smiled. Li Hao was an honest man when he first came, but he soon revealed his true colors.
         Just like his teacher, he was proud to his bones and didn't put anyone in his eyes.
         It was the same for hou Xiaochen.
         Of course, the master and disciple both owed hou Xiaochen their lives, so Li Hao had joined the night patrol to pay off his debt.
         As for Yuan Shuo, he would help hou Xiaochen out sooner or later.
         A favor was the most difficult to repay.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's head ached. After thinking for a while, he said,"I'm broke now ... I want to ask the general manager to give me some privileges."
         "Speak," he said.
         "First, the matter of promotion should be settled immediately. With the title of high-level City Patrol, it will be easier for me to go out and fool ... No, when I go out and show my identity, everyone will understand that I am valued and have status ... Otherwise, if I, a low-level City Patrol, go out and ask people to join my team, they will treat it as a joke!"
         Li Hao sighed and said,"I can't just stab every person I meet and say that I'm very powerful." At this time, we still have to look at status!"
         "That's right. I'll make a trip to the inspection Division and the administrative Bureau in the afternoon to get it settled for you as soon as possible. "Chief Steward Yu thought for a while and nodded.
         Li Hao was right.
         A low-level inspector's status was too low.
         As for his strength ... Unless he made a move, who would know? he was not a superpower.
         He couldn't just beat up everyone he saw, right?
         "Second, I want to go out and get some sponsorships ..." Li Hao continued.
          "What?"
         Chief Steward Yu frowned. Getting sponsors?
         Li Hao explained,"I'm afraid that since I'm new here, I'll ask for too many things from hou bu, making things difficult for him." The newly formed group would definitely use up more energy. If hou bu gave it to them, would the other brothers in the Wei Wu Army be unhappy? If I don't give it to you, my team won't be able to rise ..."
         This was true.
         "It's your first time building a hundred-man team, so you can still meet some basic requirements ..."Chief Steward Yu thought for a while and said.
         "That's not enough!"
         Li Hao said,"I want something else. It's not too important. It's just a few honorary quotas for low-level city patrollers ... I want to use this to get some sponsorships. Of course, I won't give them to just anyone!"
         As for the sponsorships, he would take them all.
         Chief Steward Yu frowned slightly.
         Even if he was an honorary City Patrol, he couldn't just give it away.
        
         A City Patrol was considered a high-ranking official.
         She thought for a while and shook her head."No, I can 't. Moreover, the city Patrol needs to be judged by all the divisions. How about this, I can give you a few spots as the city Patrol. This only needs to be reported internally!"
         Patrol envoy, that's out of the question.
         There were many investigators, so this didn't matter.
         The patrol envoys in the Wei Wu Army, other than the ten decapitation realm, the rest were all ... Of course, they were all low-level ones, so they were not worth much.
         As for whether Li Hao could get any benefits from this ... That would depend on his ability.
         Li Hao's head ached. After a long time, he could only nod."Alright! I originally wanted to make him a City Patrol to fool Wang Ming. His family is rich, and he's from the military, so he might be able to sponsor him. Now he's just a patrol, and he's one himself. "
         He sighed helplessly.
         Chief Yu was also speechless. So you want to trick Wang Ming into sponsoring you?
          The Wang family did have some money, but they also needed to develop themselves. How much could they give you?
         What are you thinking!
         Thinking about Li Hao's connections ... Chief Steward Yu didn't think that he would receive much support either. The main reason was that Li Hao had always been staying in a small place. In Silver City, only Liu Long had some strength, but strength didn't mean that Liu Long could support anything.
         Li Hao's two requests weren't unreasonable, and they didn't have much practical significance.
         Seeing Li Hao's worried face, Chief Steward Yu smiled. She was quite happy to see Li Hao having a headache over this.
         "Do you have any other requests?"
         She didn't mind giving Li Hao some support.
         Seeing that she seemed to be in a good mood, Li Hao was no longer polite. He carefully said,""Chief, can you give me the right to use a sword form comprehension treasure? I know that the Wei Wu Army has it, but it's all under the management of senior golden spear. I'm new here, and I need to establish my authority. If I have such a treasure, it would be easier to convince everyone! For example, the Wei Wu Army's rule is that one needs to comprehend it once every half a year to break through the late-stage of 100 ... But I'm poor now, how can I wait for half a year? I have to give them some benefits in advance to make them obedient ... What do you think?"
         Chief Steward Yu raised his eyebrows slightly and said after a long while,""These things are rare even in the ruins, not every item can do it! Moreover, since you're asking for it, it's obvious that you don't want the kind that can only be used once or twice, but one that can be used multiple times ..."
         "We usually call this kind of treasure that can help one comprehend force the Tao Wu ancient weapon. It's extremely expensive, and even divine stones are hard to buy ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao kept nodding.
         Chief Steward Yu had spoken a lot today, which meant ... They could talk!
         Sure enough, Chief Steward Yu suddenly laughed."It's not impossible to give you one. The Minister thinks highly of you. It's unreasonable if he doesn't give you support." However, I have a request. "  "Please speak, chief!"
         Li Hao hurriedly said.
         Chief Steward Yu looked at him for a while and said with a smile,""The origin god weapon in heaven battling city ... You're going to help the Minister get it!"
         Li Hao was stunned.
         He glanced at Chief Steward Yu and frowned slightly.
         Chief Steward Yu stopped smiling and said calmly,""The eight great families are of the same breath and branch. Heaven battling city is definitely the ancient city of the Wang family, one of the eight great families. Under normal circumstances, even if one really enters the inner city, it would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens to snatch that origin divine weapon!"
         ? "But the people of the eight great families can probably take it away ... The premise is that you are still alive before you take the origin god weapon."
         Li Hao frowned. After a long time, he calmly said,""It's not that it's impossible, but the effort and reward are not proportional! I'm cultivating talents for the Wei Wu Army, not embezzling them. So, even if you give me an enlightenment ancient weapon, I'll use it on the Wei Wu Army, and I'll have to pay a huge price, even my life ..."
         After saying that, Li Hao added, of course, it's not impossible! But ... If it's not about the Enlightenment ancient weapon, if I help the Marquis tribe get the origin divine weapon, the debt of saving my master's life ... Will be written off! In the future, I will still be a member of the Wei Wu Army. However, it will only be a normal superior-subordinate relationship and not a Savior ... The Marquis has also said that everything comes with a price!"
         "He didn't think that this was a life-saving favor. Back then, he asked my master to explore 30 ruins, but my master failed. So, heaven battling city, I helped my master explore ..."
         "Alright, your master's debt is paid off. What about yours?" chief Yu raised his eyebrows.
          "An exploration to pay off the debt of two people?"
         Chief Steward Yu understood hou bu's thoughts, so if Li Hao said he would pay his debt ... Then he would.
         To these martial masters, it was indeed easy for them to sell their lives if they owed a favor.
         However, hou Xiaochen understood one thing. If a Martial Master could only be locked up by a debt of gratitude, then something bad would happen sooner or later. Some people didn't lock up a Martial Master by a debt of gratitude. That would only make the Martial Master completely cut off all ties with him after he paid the debt.
         Li Hao said in a deep voice,"it's because the heaven battling city ruins this time are not ordinary. The level of danger is also not to be underestimated. Even Xuguang is in danger of death. Hou bu might know better than me. He might have even gone to investigate in advance and understood the danger!" Also, the origin god weapon of heaven battling city is no small matter. I think it's worth two of my master's and my lives!"
         "The lives of you and your master are so worthless?"
         "Minister, do you think that your lives are far more valuable than this treasure?" chief Yu laughed.
         "Minister, you're overestimating me!"
         Li Hao said softly,"besides, the Minister will also go in. If the Minister can get it, I won't have to do anything. If not, it means it's more dangerous. If I can get it ... It'll be worth it in exchange for the lives of my master and my disciple!"
        
         Chief Steward Yu thought for a moment and nodded,"alright!" I'll agree on behalf of the Minister. In addition, I'll give you an ancient weapon of enlightenment, but you can't use it many times. If you break through 100 comprehensions, it will probably dissipate after more than ten times. As for Qian battle, it may only last three to five times. "
         It seemed that the consumption of energy was different with different strength.
         It could only let someone over 100 comprehend it over ten times ... It was probably not a good thing.
         "Alright!"
         This was considered a bonus!
         That's not bad, if the people of swords gate joined, they would have to be given some benefits. Ten times, if there were a few of them who could break through 100 and comprehend [force] and enter the peak of 100, that would be good.
         As for fighting a thousand, it required a lot of power, and it depended on luck.
         Understanding and strengthening force was actually just a process. Whether or not a Martial Master could step into the thousand warrior class depended on their own accumulation and Foundation. Some martial masters could step into the thousand warrior class very quickly after understanding force.
         Influence was the pass.
         Even after obtaining the entry pass, they were still unable to enter the universe of fighters. This meant that they were not that great. They were not like the group of people from back then who were suppressed by Yuan Shuo's will.
          Chief Steward Yu was in a good mood."That's it then. Anything else you want to say?"
         If you don 't, you can leave.
         Usually, when she conversed with others, she would drive them away with a few words, unless it was a serious matter. Li Hao was an exception to this.
         "One last thing!"
         Li Hao didn't waste any time. He hurriedly said,"if I ask Minister Liu Long to come here, I hope the Nightwalker can arrange for someone from the sun glory to take charge of the Silver City. Senior Huang Yun will do. He has the wind element. Even if he encounters trouble, he can run away."
         "What?"
         Huang Yun?
         Early stage of sunlit realm ...
         Of course, after coming out of the ruins this time, he had also obtained some benefits and had now entered the mid-stage of the sun glory realm.
         This old-school sun glory had actually stayed in sun glory for many years.
         Middle stage of the glorious sun realm ...
         If it was in the past, he would not have sent them to the small silver City.
         Silver Moon had a total of 32 cities, and silver City was the smallest one.
         But now, there was Liu Long in Silver City, who was also in the martial arts thousand combat.
         If the other party came here, it would be possible to use Huang Yun as a replacement.
         "That's fine!"Chief Steward Yu nodded.
         It wasn't a big problem. Li Hao had seen a lot of three suns in Silver City, but that didn't mean they were everywhere. It was just that Li Hao's horizons had been broadened by countless times.
         Now, the three suns he saw were all at the top of the Silver Moon, experts from the central region.
         From the small silver City, his vision had risen to the peak of the Silver Moon. In fact, there were only a few Silver Moon supers, and the sun glory was still a peak powerhouse.
         "Many thanks, chief!"
         Having achieved his goal, Li Hao immediately smiled.
         He didn't stay any longer. He had to form a hundred-man team as soon as possible.
         He didn't have such thoughts before, but now that he had accepted it, he would do it.  There was strength in numbers. Besides, Li Hao had his own ideas.
         ……
         A moment later, Li Hao went to Hao lianchuan's office.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Minister, can you contact the Silver City?"
         Hao lianchuan glanced at him."You're looking for Liu Long?"
         "Yes,"
         "You can, but try not to say anything confidential. Although the night patrollers have cross-city communication, it can be easily intercepted ..."
         Li Hao didn't ask how to intercept it. He didn't care.
         Besides, it wasn't a secret.
         With Hao lianchuan's permission, Li Hao was led to an office on the fifth floor that was usually closed. There were people inside, but they rarely came out. There were some large machines in the office that Li Hao couldn't recognize.
         It felt like an antique, but he didn't know if it was dug out or made in an ancient style.
         "Contact Silver city's mu Sen!"
         Hao lianchuan said directly, then looked at Li Hao and said,""The silver Blizzard city's Nightwatchers have just been established, so they haven't had the time to set up a communication system. But mu Sen can."
         Li Hao nodded.
         The staff members quickly started operating the machine. Soon, mu Sen's chubby face appeared on the huge screen.
         Mu Sen and Mu Lin were really similar!
         Mu Lin was a little fatter, while mu Sen was much thinner.
         Mu Sen also looked over. When he saw Hao lianchuan, he quickly smiled and said,""Hao bu!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything. Instead, he glanced at the machine. It consumed mysterious energy. This thing could be considered an extraordinary item, not a simple electronic communication device.
         "Quickly call Liu Long over. Li Hao is looking for him!"
         Mu Sen did not say much and immediately ordered someone to contact Liu Long. The two sides were not far apart. The night patrolman was in the law enforcement building next door, and Liu Long did not usually go out.
         In less than three minutes, Liu Long, who was still wearing his trench coat, quickly strode over.
          Liu Long also saw Hao lianchuan and greeted him. He then looked at Li Hao.
         Li Hao didn't say much in front of these people. He directly said,""Boss, I've joined the Wei Wu Army here, and I'm leading a 100-man team on my own. It's just that I don't have any manpower right now. If boss doesn't mind, you can bring a small demon hunting team here, and we'll have a better chance."
         Mu Sen was a little surprised when he heard this.
         Li Hao formed a 100-man team on his own?
         Qian Dou?
         That was fast!
         He was still a little surprised, but after thinking about it, he realized that it was normal for him to use a thousand-man combat technique. After all, Li Hao had already broken through 100-man combat technique, and his improvement was even faster.
         It was unexpected that a guy who had just entered the thousand-player class could be recognized so quickly and form a hundred-man team.
         As for Liu Long, he slightly frowned.
         "The night patrolman will have senior Huang Yun take charge. If it really doesn't work, I'll have Wang Ming go," Li Hao said.
        
         Hao lianchuan glanced at Li Hao.
         Good Lord, you have a lot of power now. Do you think you can transfer sunlight as you please?
         Wang Ming could also be considered a genius among the night watchers, and he was indeed a genius.
         Wang Ming could sense the existence of five superpower locks, so his path hadn't ended yet. He had only broken three of them so far. If everything went smoothly, he could step into the rising light.
         Of course, talent was talent. Whether one could enter the rising light was also up to chance and luck.
         But Wang Ming's transfer really wasn't something Li Hao could decide.
         Unless ... Wang Ming himself had to do it.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Was that even possible?
         Hao lianchuan was not sure.
         Liu Long pondered for a moment before saying,"Do you want to bring everyone, or do you want me to do it alone?"
          "All martial masters can come, and it's best if all of them come. As for sister yunyao and the others, boss can ask for their opinions. But if they come, they can only enter the night patrol or the Wei Wu Army's logistics system."
         After saying that, Li Hao continued,"now that white moon City is in turmoil, we'll have a greater chance if we come here!" Silver City ... Could be put aside for now! Also, you can see many old seniors here, earth-overturning sword, golden spear, Jade Rakshasa, Southern Fist, heart-stabbing beauty ..."
         "Wulin ... Is back!" Li Hao laughed.
         "Golden spear?"
         Liu Long's eyes flickered slightly. That was the top-notch Martial Master who, like his father, was also known as the Silver Moon three Spears. The other party ... Was still alive?
         As silver Spear's son, he no longer used a spear.
         However, his father's Silver spear still had a deep influence on him. The spear of the Liu family had once been famous all over the world!
         Liu Long's eyes flickered. Li Hao had asked him to go because he felt that the Silver City was no longer the center of chaos, and the stone gate ruins could be put aside for now.
         He considered for a moment and nodded,"alright!" I'll pack my things today, and I'll be able to rush to white moon City within three days ... However, Huang Yun must be here within three days. "
         Li Hao laughed."Sure. Senior Huang Yun can fly, and he's of the wind element. He's very fast. One day will be enough."
         Hao lianchuan wanted to roll his eyes!
         You speak as if Huang Yun is your subordinate. I should be the one to say that.
         Liu Long and Li Hao both ignored him. Liu Long wanted to leave after he finished speaking, but he thought for a while and said,""Is there anything you need me to bring or do?"
         He didn't know when he would be back after leaving this time.
         Li Hao thought for a moment and smiled."It's nothing much. I left in a hurry last time and forgot to burn some paper for my friend. Boss, please make a trip there and tell him one thing ... The next time I go to see him, I'll definitely bring back more heads of the Crimson Moon Warriors!"
         These murderous words came from Li Hao's mouth, but they were so natural and calm.
         At this moment, even mu Sen, who was opposite him, felt a chill.
         Li Hao had changed a lot after his trip to white moon City.
         Liu Long was also slightly startled, but he quickly nodded and left without saying anything.
         Mu Sen wanted to chat, but just as he was about to open his mouth, Li Hao said,""Secretary mu, Captain Mulin said he misses you and wants you to return to white moon City early."
         Mu Sen was stunned. Would boss miss me?
         You must be joking!
         But Li Hao wouldn't lie, would he? there was no need to.
          He nodded."I'll make a trip back during my next vacation. I didn't expect my big brother to be so emotional this time."  Li Hao smiled and didn't say anything.
         Meanwhile, Hao lianchuan had his men hang up the communication.
         After ending the communication, he glanced at Li Hao and asked curiously,""Mulin is missing his younger brother, why would he tell you?"
         "I want to hit him!"
         Hao lianchuan was speechless. This kid had really turned bad!
         "Do you need my help to form a 100-man team?"
         Hao lianchuan did not know about this before, so he was very warm-hearted.
         Unfortunately, he was not a Martial Master.
         Thus, Li Hao shook his head and decided to forget it.
         ……
         Li Hao didn't stay too long at the Nightwalker headquarters.
         He was still very busy.
         He had been busy with comprehending the way of the sword and preparing for the new army. If he had not come to take a look and look for Liu Long, he would not have returned.
         ……
         An hour later.
         Li Hao once again returned to the Wei Wu Army. This time, he had run back, so he was still very tired. However, he couldn't use hou bu's car whenever he wanted to, so he was helpless.
         As soon as he entered the Wei Wu Army's gatehouse, Mu Lin smelled it and immediately appeared.
         After sizing Li Hao up, he chuckled and said,""That was the fire Phoenix spear?"
         "Yes."
         "You're back just in time, our boss wants to see you!"
         Golden spear!
         Li Hao felt a little embarrassed that he had ignored them earlier. He smiled and said,""I really did have something to do just now, so I decided to treat my injuries. Golden spear senior, you're not angry, right?"
          "That's not necessary. "
         "Our boss is quite generous, but he's a little strict and old-fashioned. As long as you follow the rules, it'll be fine!" Mu Lin said as he walked. Remember, in front of this person, be a little more careful with what you say. It's not appropriate to be all happy and happy. He likes to be more serious. "
         Li Hao nodded.
         The two of them walked toward the office area.
         Mu Lin continued,"in addition, the boss also knows that you challenged the other Centurions. He didn't say anything. However, don't go crazy and challenge him. He's very strong!"
         "How strong?"
         Li Hao was a little curious. It was very difficult for martial masters to determine their actual strength.
         Even though he knew that the other party was strong, he had no idea how strong he was.
         "How strong?"
         Mu Lin thought for a moment and didn't know how to say it. After a while, he said,"In any case, he's very strong. Last year, we went to a historical remains and boss sent a peak three suns expert flying with a single shot. Even if he's not as strong as sunguang ... I think he's about there!"
        
         He sighed."After all, this person was already strong in his early years. The Marquis's tribe has supported him all these years. He's comparable to the early stages of the rising light realm ... This shouldn't be a problem, right?"
         Li Hao narrowed his eyes. He was indeed not weak.
         However ... Strictly speaking, if he had entered the universe master level a few years ago and had hou Xiaochen's support, he would have been comparable to sunguang. He might have been the weakest among the three.
         BA Dao had killed the three suns seven years ago, and the sky sword in the middle region could even kill some sunrise realm experts.
         However, considering that this person had relied on hou Xiaochen to break his will, Li Hao didn't think too much about it.
         Soon, the two of them arrived at a small building.
         At the entrance of the small building, a young man stood straight and looked at Li Hao. He didn't look very old, at most around 30 years old.
         At this moment, Mu Lin transmitted his voice,"the captain of the boss's personal guards is called Wang Qing. He entered the Qian warrior realm two years ago. He is not weak." He's not a spear user, he's a saber user. "
         "Speaking of which, I might have some enmity with you. Back then, your master killed two of the Silver Moon four blade Kings, leaving only BA Dao and killing blade alive. This man is killing blade's disciple ..."
         Since he was alive, where was the hatred?
          Li Hao thought for a moment. It was probably because frenzied sword had been beaten up by his teacher before but wasn't killed, so they had a grudge.
         He also knew a little about killing blade.
         Ever since the Silver Moon martial forest's characters kept appearing, he had also done some research. Putting aside BA Dao, he was the strongest among the four blade Kings. If frenzied sword could survive, he was not weak either. It was just that he had not appeared for many years.
         It was said that frenzied sword was good at the manic explosion. His teacher had once said that the manic explosion was also a kind of saber technique from the ancient civilization and was very powerful.
         According to the ancient books his teacher had read, manic explosion was only one of the many saber techniques. It was said that there were even more powerful saber techniques, such as "heavenly Emperor Slayer" and "immortal vanquishing divine saber"...
         It was shocking to hear.
         However, it seemed that they had all been lost. Frenzied sword had become famous in Silver Moon, but he only used the manic explosion.
         While the two were chatting, Wang Qing, who had a well-proportioned body but a slightly thicker right arm, saw them. He nodded at Mu Lin and then looked at Li Hao. His voice was not cold, but rather calm."Centurion li, if you have time, we can exchange pointers."
         Li Hao glanced at him and nodded. He didn't refuse.
         Frenzied blade's disciple!
         He might not be weak, but ... No matter how strong he was, could he be stronger than Mu Lin?
         "The thousand-man commander is upstairs. Please go up!"
         Wang Qing didn't say anything more. He made way for the two to go upstairs.
         ……
         As Mu Lin went up the stairs, he transmitted his voice,""This kid is still very strong. He has also learned the essence of the manic explosion and comprehended the saber intent."
         "Yes, is his master still alive?"
         "He's alive. "
         Mu Lin replied,"frenzied blade has always been alive. It's just that he has not been in Silver Moon for the past few years. He only returned a few years ago and is now working for the military. I did not ask about the details, but I heard that commander Yu thinks highly of him."
         He joined the Silver Moon Army?
          Li Hao's eyes flickered. Many of these senior martial masters had chosen to join various large organizations.  The Golden spear was in the Wei Wu Army, killing blade had gone to the Silver Moon Army, and the southern Fist had joined the royal family ...
         They must have gained a lot of benefits, right?
         "Then why did Wang Qing come to the Wei Wu Army?"
         Why didn't he go to the Silver Moon Army when his master was there?
         "Wang Qing's knife spirit is different from his master 's, but our boss's spear spirit is similar to Wang Qing' s. The spear is as fierce as fire! Although frenzied sword's blade is also fierce, it's still a little weaker than boss's spear intent. That's why Wang Qing chose to come here, and he's here for boss. "
         Li Hao understood.
         As they spoke, the two of them had already gone upstairs. The place was huge, and the entire second floor was filled with golden guns.
         There was a living room upstairs.
         The Golden spear was not there. It was in the office.
         If he did not have a Secretary, Wang Qing would be Jin gun's Secretary.
         "Come in!"
         Before Mu Lin could say hello, Jin gun's voice came from the office.
         Mu Lin walked over with Li Hao. When he opened the door, Jin Jin was sitting upright. Seeing Li Hao, he smiled stiffly.
         "Sit!"
         Mu Lin sat down without any hesitation.
         Seeing this, Li Hao quickly sat down.
         Golden spear stood up and glanced at Li Hao. After scanning the crowd, he nodded slightly. "I've also seen the strength of Yuan Shuo's disciple. He didn't embarrass your master. "
         "Senior is too kind!"
          "There's no need to call me senior. This Is the Army. Call me a chiliarch!"
         "Yes, Captain!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was very obedient.
         He wasn't afraid of Jin gun. Jin gun sized him up, and Li Hao also looked up at Jin gun. His eyes were sharp, and his body was burly. He looked to be about 50 years old, and he had a typical square face, which made him look very majestic.
         The silvers were all very tall. Being in the North, they were slightly taller than the South.
         Seeing Li Hao looking at him, golden spear also stared at Li Hao.
         He didn't release any aura and just watched silently.
         After watching for a long time and seeing that Li Hao's eyes were fearless, he smiled. However, there are still some rules in the Army. Martial masters don't like to be bound. As a Martial Master, I understand that!"
         "However, since you have chosen to join us ... You will need to compromise! Li Hao, I usually don't care about you, but when you're on a mission, you can only follow orders and not make decisions on your own!"
         "That's one of the reasons. Second, you can form a hundred-man team, but you have to be responsible to the end! Losses were allowed. However, if the losses are too great, you won't be suitable to be a Centurion ... If the losses exceed 30%, you can leave on your own!"
        
         "Martial masters like to take risks, but some people risk other people's lives. Martial masters are good, but they have a weakness. Selfish! This was also something that all martial masters acknowledged! In the eyes of martial masters, except for their own disciples and relatives, everyone else's life and death are determined by fate. This is the rule of the martial world ... But you must remember, this is not the martial world!"
         He pointed at Mu Lin and said,"this guy is also alone!" "He was once a Centurion, but not long after, nearly half of his men died, so he was dismissed. Although he's now a vice-captain, it's just a title. He doesn't have the right to lead an Army!"
         Mu Lin looked depressed. Seeing Li Hao looking at him, he quickly explained,""That's not what happened. I was unlucky that time and encountered great danger. I've already taken responsibility ... Forget it. I won't explain. The military won't give me a chance to explain."
         He was a little depressed. The position of a vice-captain was high, but in reality, it was not as powerful as a Centurion. He also wanted to lead the Army ... But Jin gun did not give him that opportunity.
         Jin Jin didn't care about his explanation. He looked at Li Hao and said,""There's no need for a reason, Li Hao. Here, you might be able to learn what's called fairness and responsibility! The Wei Wu Army will slowly teach you!"
         "As a Martial Master, you can be irresponsible and have no sense of justice. However, as a guard Wu Army that Silvermoon spent a lot of money to build, you must have it!"
         Li Hao nodded. In fact, he still didn't feel much.
         Jin Jin was very understanding. All martial masters who had just entered the Wei Wu Army had similar thoughts.
         However, they would learn it sooner or later!
         Of course, people might die in the process.
          However, martial masters could also die, and it all depended on whether their death was worth it.
         When hou Xiaochen established the Wei Wu Army, he recruited a large number of martial masters. Some of the martial masters had changed from lone travelers to members of the Army.
         "Yu Luosha just sent me a message and asked me to give you an ancient weapon of enlightenment. I can give it to you ... But you have to remember that all the treasures of the Wei Wu Army were exchanged with lives!"
         "You're taking all these now, but you'll have to pay in the future!"
         At this moment, Li Hao thought of Liu Long.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com When Liu Long gave himself the mysterious energy for the first time, he had actually said some things. Some things were exchanged with human lives. If you used it for granted, and you still thought that you had used too little, then you had no conscience.
         I've nurtured you and supported you in the hope that you'll repay me in the future.
         If you don't give back, your team will collapse sooner or later.
         "Understood!" Li Hao nodded.
         "It's good that you understand!"
         Jin Jin suddenly changed the topic, "You'll understand all of this in the future! He hasn't left Silver Moon for many years. Ying Hongyue has sealed off all his exits. All these years, the red moon that Ying Hongyue created has been preventing your master from leaving Silver Moon, not giving him any chance ... Do you know why?"
         "Are you afraid of my master?" Li Hao asked after some thought.
         "Yes!"
         "Don't think that Yuan Shuo is useless just because you've met some powerful people," Jin Jin gun said solemnly."Your master has been locked up in Silver Moon for twenty years. In these twenty years, there have been people watching him, not allowing him to leave Silver Moon. They were worried that he would be able to fly high and leap over the Dragon Gate once he leaves Silver Moon!"
         "Ying Hongyue actually doesn't care if we leave the Silver Moon. The only person he's afraid of is your master!"
         "So, now that your master has gone out, the one who wants to kill him the most is Ying Hongyue. She knows all too well what will happen to your master once he is given enough time and opportunity."
         Li Hao looked at Jin gun, not quite understanding what he meant.
         "As far as I know, the orange and yellow moons have disappeared recently in the seventh month of the Crimson Moon. There's a 90% chance that they went to kill your master. In the seventh month, besides Ying Hongyue, the second and third strongest experts have both gone to find your master! They, on the other hand, have astonishing battle records in the central region, killing Xuguang!"
         "Orange moon. She was a Silver Moon Martial Master back then. She was quite famous. You might have heard of her name, black spider!"  Li Hao raised his eyebrows.
         "Yes, but she likes to call herself Spider."
         Li Hao thought for a moment and said,""Understood!"
         What do you understand?
         Golden spear was puzzled.
         Of course, Li Hao understood. The current third-generation Purple Moon is orange moon's daughter. I'm going to capture Purple Moon and use her life to threaten orange moon.
         If orange moon dared to play dirty, he would capture Purple Moon and cut off her arm today, or her leg tomorrow ...
         Do you, orange moon, dare to make a move?
         Since they dared to come to Silver Moon, Li Hao would find the hidden experts to take action. As for whether they would take action or not, he would naturally find a way to do so when the time came.
         So, he understood.
         Capture the purple Moon and threaten the orange moon.
         Was this what the Golden spear meant?
         The Golden spear was still a little suspicious. 'You really understood?
         What he meant was that he was telling Li Hao not to slack off just because he was strong now. His master was in danger. Someone like his master could die at any time, and so could he.
         Therefore, he had to work harder in his cultivation!
         I hope that one day, when your master is really killed, you will still have the strength to take revenge.
         Yes, that was what he meant.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. Black Widow ... Was very powerful. So what if she had killed Xu Guang?
          There was also the name Black Widow on the list of 36 heroes.
         However, Li Hao wasn't too afraid of these people. His teacher, Black Widow, had once mentioned that if they didn't have great abilities, they didn't need to pay much attention to them. These people who seduced men by showing off their beauty weren't considered strong.
         The Black Widow had this title because of her seven or eight husbands who had died. As for how they died, only she knew.
         As for whether he cared about his daughter, he definitely did.
         After all, she was only a Black Widow, not a black mother. Li Hao wasn't sure if she had many children. Orange moon was obviously very concerned that Purple Moon was assigned to Silver Moon as one of the July 's.
         As for whether Chief Steward Yu would interfere ... Li Hao didn't care.
         You killed my master, I killed your daughter. If Chief Steward Yu meddles in this, I'll bear with her for now, and after a period of time, I'll kill both of them ...
         Well, Li Hao quickly suppressed this thought. He couldn't think like that. Chief Steward Yu was still a good person.
         The conversation ended there.
         The Golden spear watched the two of them leave, but it was still puzzled. This fellow, his killing intent was so intense just now, what did he understand?
