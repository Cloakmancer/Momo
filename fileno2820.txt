Just as he was thinking, the Supreme martial artist's voice sounded in his ear again,""Stop guessing. The sun god coincidentally bumped into an extreme yang great world! Many level six venerable sovereigns have some problems in neo martial arts. You know the serious problems! Even the neo martial world currently lacks this. Tell me, compared to a great world's seventh level venerable sovereign, which one is more important?"“……”The sword Saint quickly understood."Sun god ... You're so lucky!"It was no wonder that the Supreme martial artist could not dispatch any manpower. Otherwise, even if they did not send a seventh-grade cultivator, they could still send a few sixth-grade cultivators.Blood Emperor, iron head, lie Shen, King of earth, Lao Zhen, Lao Zao, Emperor of the West ...With all these people charging over, surrounding and killing a tier 7 was no problem.Now, he understood.These people had all died once. After all, neo martial was only a newly-born great Dao universe. The vitality and Yang Qi contained within it were not very sufficient. Fang ping was also an extremely realistic person. Everyone understood that.After the Supremes were resurrected, they were full of Yang Qi.The others ... Were a level lower.As for Supreme martial artists, they had to resolve this internal unfairness. Otherwise, although neo martial artists were united, it was easy for problems to arise. He had to make up for the Yang Qi of some people, especially those rank six venerable sovereigns.Otherwise, it would be hard to enter Grade 7.Now that they had finally discovered a sun great world, they had to deal with it even if they had to give up on the battle with the Crimson Moon."Is that side very strong?""It's very strong, extremely yang, and extremely good at attacking! Moreover, we can't cause too much of a commotion to avoid being discovered. Being between the Redmoon region and the Scarlet sun region, we still have to be on guard against the Scarlet sun region's discovery ..."Sword Saint nodded his head. He understood now.In that case, he could only give up.It was no wonder that after waiting for so long, he did not see anyone else. He had originally thought that old Zhang might send some people over at a critical moment.Of course, that side was more important.After replenishing their Yang Qi and vitality, some people would have a high chance of stepping into the seventh rank. However, even if they reached the sixth rank, it was almost impossible to reach the seventh rank.The Grandmaster's voice rang out again."I'm the one who voluntarily gave up on celestial pole and the others. If they really die, I'll explain it to them. You don't have to put your life on the line for them!""You don't have to worry about it!"Venerable the sword was too lazy to listen.He just stared at a fleeing battleship in the distance.Old Zhang had always been like this. Sometimes, he was cold to the bone. Celestial pole and the others were bait. It was his plan, but he had discovered the more critical sunreach world and given up just like that ... Even though he had sent him here, he was only doing his best. He didn't have to save them.If not for Fang Ping's support, a guy like him would have been sniped by others countless times.Of course, it was also because of the existence of such a guy that neo martial arts could overcome the crisis time and time again. Everyone knew in their hearts that they could only pinch their noses and accept it.At this moment, the warship in the distance seemed to have dropped something.The seventh rank venerable sovereign who was pursuing him was slightly stunned.He also looked at the thing that was thrown down. In the next moment, the document that was thrown down turned into a human figure. The rank seven venerable sovereign instantly understood. He looked at the figure and suddenly laughed,""You want to escape?"He really wanted to escape!This was probably the avatar of the Supreme martial artist from new martial arts.Many people knew that this guy liked to throw his clones everywhere. The other party had left this thing behind, so it was obvious that he was going to escape.What a pity!He felt a little regretful. This way, it wouldn't be easy to catch a big fish. More importantly, the Silver Moon King and his group might not come.He didn't waste any time and was about to destroy the illusionary figure.Suddenly, he frowned.The next moment, he revealed a look of joy,"I've still caught a big fish!."Sword Saint!Not bad.Although they did not manage to capture the new king Silvermoon, it was not a bad thing to capture venerable the sword. He was the master of the neo martial human King. In fact, he was not. However, in the outside world and in the chaos, everyone thought so.The human King's master, this was a super big fish.It was even more important than the Supreme neo martial artist!This guy actually dared to appear. He actually appeared. Did he not know how big the gap between the sixth and seventh rank was?"Red Moon!"With a chuckle, the entire chaos was suddenly covered by a Red Moon. There was only one red Moon in the world.The power of great DAOs filled the world. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​   In an instant, a Dao domain that was exclusive to tier 7 even appeared in the surroundings.My own domain!It covered all directions.This was the power of a seventh-tier beast. Escape? where to?The domain directly covered the entire area.Not only that, but at this moment, within the entire boundary, countless red powers appeared and turned into red Shadows. All kinds of images appeared between the heaven and earth, and all kinds of power of desire filled the heaven and earth.The two people from Heaven's Fate who were fleeing in front of him were instantly hit.Heaven's Fate suddenly yawned. He was a little lazy and drowsy. He really wanted to sleep.As for King Huai, a hint of greed and madness appeared in his eyes. He really wanted to kill Heaven's Fate, eat him, and let him advance to the third stage!It was an instinctive reaction, a desire deep in the heart!A seventh rank venerable sovereign was unbelievably powerful. The two venerable sovereigns were still far away from him, so they were instantly enveloped and hit.Even the shadow that was thrown away was trembling a little at this moment, as if it was wavering, as if it was also revealing a little greed. It really wanted to become the original body and no longer a clone.

2821 Chapter 465
Just as the rank seven venerable sovereign revealed a smile, a ray of sword light suddenly appeared between heaven and earth!Without a sound, the domain shattered.Countless Red Shadows instantly disappeared!The red moon was broken. A man walked out from the chaos with an invisible sword in his hand. He looked at the venerable sovereign in the distance indifferently and sneered,""Desire? My desire is to kill you with a single sword strike. Is that strong enough?"He raised his hand and raised his sword. The sword was invisible!Primal Chaos as the sword!Thousands of Red Shadows gathered and instantly condensed. With a slash of the sword, the entire domain was completely shattered. In the distance, the rank seven venerable sovereign raised his hand. Thousands of Red Shadows gathered and turned into a huge puppet of the great path.In just an instant, the puppet was shattered, and the sword radiance flickered. With a loud boom, it was as if the chaos had exploded!Sword Saint didn't say a word.A bloody gash appeared on Hong Yue's seventh rank venerable sovereign's face. He looked at venerable sword in disbelief. After a long time, he chuckled."Sword Saint, you live up to your name! However, how many times can you use such a sword?"  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Very strong!You broke my domain with one sword, cut my Dao tapir with one sword, and injured my true body!This person's attack power was unparalleled!But how many times can you slash out with such a sword?No wonder it was said that a neo martial Swordmaster was unparalleled in his attacks and could easily defeat an upper-level cultivator. One must know that this was the venerable sovereign level, no longer a weak realm.Can you defeat me?"How many?" venerable the sword laughed. You'll know when you try!"When he unsheathed the sword, it was as if he had pulled out a long sword from the depths of chaos. The long sword was like a river of the great Dao. Tens of thousands of DAOs converged again. Without a sound or presence, the sword slashed out, and heaven and earth seemed to be divided. The sword domain appeared!Ten thousand DAOs turned into heaven and earth, shrouding the entire area. Even rank seven venerable sovereigns were enveloped within!Ten thousand swords appeared. In the chaos, only ten thousand swords appeared. Jian Wushuang! BOOM!A loud sound rang out again, and the great Dao shook. A great Dao universe seemed to have descended-the Crimson Moon universe!Sword saint's voice sounded,"so what if it's the great path universe?" Did they dare to descend here? If the Crimson Moon master dares to come, the Crimson Moon world will be broken!"It was silent!The red moon master had not arrived.The defense of the red moon's native world was weak. He could not descend rashly at this moment. Once he descended here for a sword venerable, it would be a huge problem if the native world was invaded.If the human King was here, he could still descend. Unfortunately, he was not the human King."Kill him!" Red Moon Master's Voice reverberated, and it quickly dissipated.The sword Saint was strong, but he was only at the sixth rank!If a tier 7 neo martial artist arrived, he would come here and kill him even if he had to take the risk!In the sword domain, the rank seven venerable sovereign's face was flushed red, and bloody wounds appeared on his body.He looked at venerable the sword with a ferocious look.What a great sword venerable!Dao domain was the fusion of 10000 DAOs. This person's offensive power was not weaker than a Grade 7. It all depended on how long he could last.At this moment, he could no longer care about the celestial pole Huai King. He would let those two shrimps escape as they pleased.Killing venerable the sword was no less than killing a tier seven neo martial artist!"Hmph!""Hmph!" With a cold snort, the Dao domain reappeared, and a huge, furious Dao tapir appeared. With a crazed and furious intent, it punched the heaven and earth. The sword domain shook, and two monstrous forces instantly spread in all directions!……A battleship quickly fled. The drowsy celestial pole woke up and glanced at King Huai. After a long while, he said gloomily,"F * ck, you want to eat me? you're really an animal!""It's a misunderstanding, it's really a misunderstanding!"King Huai smiled in a flattering manner."That's the truth!"Tian Ji coldly snorted. The next moment, he suddenly laughed and patted King Huai."Run first. I'll deal with you after you run away!"It'll be fine once you get used to it.He wasn't that angry.King Huai, this fellow, had a dark side in the depths of his heart. His desire had been stimulated and he wanted to eat him. This was all too normal.King Huai smiled in a flattering manner again. Venerable sovereign's blood essence appeared and directly burned the battleship. He didn't care about the losses. His smile was bright as he tried to please Heaven's Fate."Look, although I want to eat you, it's just a thought. Now, you don't need to worry. I'll burn my blood essence to help you escape. Are you happy?"Heaven's Fate nodded happily!King Huai was still the sensible one!He turned his head to take a look. In the next moment, he spat out a mouthful of blood and instantly burned it. He couldn't be happy anymore. Two extremely powerful energy fluctuations instantly engulfed the entire chaos!If he didn't run, he would be killed by the aftermath of the two!He was speechless. It was still the sword venerable ox. He could really go against a seventh-rank!Unfortunately, he didn't know how many strikes it could last.A thousand years had passed since then, so he should at least be able to withstand a few more sword strikes!

Chapter 2822 We're Different (1)
The sword light shot into the void.The red moon appeared in the sky.The two top experts fought. Even though they were far apart, Li Hao could feel an extremely powerful energy explosion. The firmament sword, which was still being nurtured in the river, suddenly trembled.A swordsman!Sword Saint!Venerable the sword had appeared and fought with a rank seven. As someone who had experienced the power of a pseudo-rank seven, Li Hao could tell instantly.Before Wushan made his move and dealt with the Crimson Moon experts, venerable the sword had already made his move.A sixth-rank against a seventh-rank!An upper-level cultivator!In the chaos, it was almost impossible for a Tier 3 to fight a Tier 4, let alone a Tier 6 to a tier 7. Even Li Hao had never really fought a Tier 4 during his time as a Tier 3.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  He only felt that he could win.Of course, it would take a lot of energy and time.As for a level six defeating a level Seven ... Li Hao had not thought about it yet, but he had seen it today ... Of course, it was only a fight, not a fight, but it was something that countless level six cultivators could only look forward to.The seventh rank, a high-level venerable sovereign, was the symbol of a master of a major world and a Dao master.An Overlord!"Terrifying!"Qian Wuliang suddenly emerged from the river and was a little shocked. He could feel the burst of sword essence even from far away. He was also a path master, and the key was that The Phantom path, the reality path, and the convergence of stars were all in the shape of swords.And this great Dao actually had a lot to do with the sword Saint.At this moment, when the sword Saint exploded, even he felt the great Dao in his body tremble. The Dao Meridian in his body trembled. The sword of the sword Saint was the embryonic form of the Silver Moon great path universe.Li Hao didn't need to say anything. He already knew who the other party was.The new martial Swordmaster!Silver Moon master ... The Silver Moon master from more than 50 years ago in the chaos. He had influenced all the powerful fighters in Silver Moon. He was the one who had the greatest influence on Silver Moon among the neo martial artists.In an instant, Qian Wuliang knew that the great Dao universe had a great relationship with this person.If he was like this, Hong Yitang was no exception.……At another location.Among the venerable sovereigns who were moving stealthily, Hong Yitang's body trembled slightly. He looked in that direction and his eyes were filled with shock. Sword venerable!Just like Qian Wuliang, his Dao meridians were also trembling.The river of chaos that had fused into his body was also churning.It was as if Changhe had sensed the sword intent and the aura of the source.Not only that, but when venerable the sword attacked, he instantly sensed an aura of the same origin from another direction-Qian Wuliang!He's here!Did that mean Li Hao had come?Hong Yitang was both happy and solemn.The sword Saint was fighting with the red moon. The point was, that person might be Hong Yue's advanced venerable sovereign, and venerable sword ... Was not an advanced venerable sovereign, was he?If one didn't know how powerful a high level venerable sovereign was, it would be a waste of time.In the eyes of all venerable sovereigns, advanced venerable sovereigns were unrivaled and unattainable.But now, the sword Saint had made his move."Hurry up!""Hurry up and meet up with senior Empyrean pole!" Hong Yitang bellowed."Also, Marchioness Silvermoon and the others have returned. Let's meet them first and locate them!"The three venerable sovereigns who had surrendered were also shocked and scared.The neo martial Swordmaster, was he crazy? He dared to fight with a seventh-rank!Previously, Huilong's people had wanted to kill this person?What a joke!Although there were a few level six and a group of level four and level five, just based on his aura and the strength of his sword essence ... Huilong would probably be defeated by venerable the sword in one move.How could he be so strong?If Tian Fang's four tier 6 experts met this person, they would probably be killed with four slashes, right?In an instant, the few of them were extremely quiet, silently suppressing the shock in their hearts.Even if venerable sword was very powerful, it was a little arrogant to fight with Hong Yue, a high-level venerable sovereign.Moreover, this was the territory of the red moon.It wasn't wise to start a war here. With the emergence of new martial arts, many people also knew one thing, venerable sword ... One sword Hero.Perhaps it was not as exaggerated as one stroke, but it was true that its endurance was not good. The explosive power was too strong, which led to its inability to last. This was normal. If it could explode and last for a long time, it would not be a sixth rank sword venerable.At this time, the few of them did not dare to say anything. They quickly met up with Heaven's Fate and the others, and then ran away together.As for Li Hao, it was useless.Last time, Li Hao had only been able to maintain the power of the fifth step.Tier 5 ... In such a situation, they were only cannon fodder. It was already good enough that they could escape.Both sides quickly moved closer to each other.From the time Heaven's Fate and the others walked out of neo martial until now, they had been drifting in the chaos for more than a year. It was much earlier than expected. The two sides began to meet officially in the Crimson Moon's territory.This was also the first time that Silver Moon and neo martial had officially met with powerhouses.Li Hao's trip to new martial arts didn't count, nor did he meet Lizhu on the way. Besides, he couldn't be sure if that person was Lizhu or not. But at this time, the two sides could be considered to have truly met.Both sides were impatient.Their speed was naturally very fast.Moreover, there was still a battle between the seventh rank. No one knew how long venerable the sword could hold out for. He dared not delay and was not even afraid of exposing his whereabouts.After a while.The battle over there was still erupting. On this side, a warship appeared in the void. Heaven's Fate and King Huai quickly stepped out of the warship and looked at the other side, slightly surprised.On the other side, apart from Lin Hongyu, Hong Yitang, the celestial pole clone, and Zhang an, there were three venerable sovereigns and a total of six venerable sovereigns ... Including the celestial pole clone.

Chapter 2823 We're Different (2)
Quite a few!Hong Yitang, a second level venerable sovereign, as well as Chan Xiu and Gou RUO, who had surrendered, were all second level venerable sovereigns.Heaven's Fate quickly looked at his clone and then at the others.He was slightly puzzled.The reason why he was puzzled was because he sensed a unique aura from Hong Yitang. Dao master?The Dao master was naturally the Silver Moon King.Second rank?He wasn't too weak, after all, Silver Moon had only just been unsealed, but ... He wasn't as outstanding as he had imagined, only at rank two.This was the first reason. Secondly ... This person looked a little older.This wasn't referring to his actual age, but rather, the speed at which ordinary King tiers rose to power was extremely fast. King tiers who were sealed off from small worlds like this would only be around 20 to 30 years old in his estimation.But this one ... She's probably in her 50s, 60s, or 70s, right?He looked a little old ... Well, in fact, it was rare to see such a young venerable sovereign. However, the closed Silver Moon actually let a 50 - 60 year old guy become King ... It was still a little disappointing.Third, this person ... I can't feel it. He just lacks the aura of a King. He doesn't have the thought of making you prostrate in worship at First sight like a human King.The human King was so overbearing that even if he might not be able to compare to you, you would know that he was not to be trifled with when you saw him.It's a master! However, the first impression Hong Yitang gave Heaven's Fate ... Was that he was quite refined, a little bookish, a little like a teacher, and a little vigorous ...Other than these, there didn't seem to be much.The Silver Moon King wasn't a young man, he was a little disappointed.Heaven's Fate thought to himself.King Huai also quickly sized him up. Before he could say anything, he quickly said, "Let's go!""Come up!" He quickly maneuvered the warship and shouted."All of you, come up!"Hong Yitang and the others didn't delay.They quickly boarded the warship.The speed of this battleship was not slow. When activated, it could catch up with a middle-stage venerable sovereign. At this moment, the energy ripples behind them had exploded and were rapidly approaching them. King Huai shouted,"All of you, burst out and defend! In case they were killed by the aftermath! Protect Zhang an!"Zhang an was the only non-venerable sovereign.Of course, they knew who Zhang an was. At this moment, they were also worried that Zhang an would be killed by the aftermath.The surrendered venerable sovereigns quickly looked at Hong Yitang. Hong Yitang immediately said,""Defend!"A large amount of earth-type power appeared on his body, and King Huai quickly drove the battleship to escape. At this time, the celestial pole's avatar looked at the celestial pole himself, but the latter ignored the avatar.He only looked at the crowd and quickly sent a message to King Huai,"Fuse his Grand DAOs?""It won't melt!" King Huai replied. “……”Celestial pole was a little surprised.Didn't you agree to melt it?King Huai transmitted his voice again,"it's only at the second rank. I'm a little disappointed!" I originally thought that it would be at least rank three, and such a new king would improve very quickly. In the end, it's only rank two, not up to my expectations! Besides ... Venerable the sword is engaged in a fierce battle. This guy met up with us, but he didn't even say a word or mention it. He doesn't seem reliable! In addition ..."King Huai paused for a moment before transmitting his voice,'he seems to be restricted by a woman. When I asked him just now, he even glanced at the first level Empress! This can't do. He's lustful of women and afraid of his wife. This is absolutely not okay. He's too easy to fall into a trap! Quickly fuse with your clone, and it'll at least reach level two. Not to mention level four, it won't be a problem for it to reach the perfected level three. Drive the battleship and take us away!"The moment he saw Silver moon's group, he decided not to get along with them.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  It did not meet his expectations.Even if he chose to lie flat ... He couldn't just randomly choose a person to lie down on.He had to rely on himself!It was not that these people were not outstanding, but they had become venerable sovereigns at such a young age. Who dared to say that they were not outstanding?However ... It did not give him a huge impact.In this way ... It would not melt.Otherwise, they would not be able to escape.Even if we lie flat, we have to lie down on someone who looks reliable. This kind of reliability might not be solid. It might be madness, high-spirited, arrogant, reckless, crazy ... All of these would work.He didn't want to be down-to-earth. At this time, down-to-earth people ... Were unreliable.Hong Yitang was an honest and sincere person. He was actually very down-to-earth. With one look, one could tell that this person's personality wasn't too bad. However ... Such a down-to-earth person, we didn't believe that he could turn the tables.Run!Heaven's Fate also instantly understood. He glanced at the few of them and didn't say anything. He only looked at the clone with some hesitation. The clone wasn't considered weak. Should he merge with it?These people must have paid a huge price to upgrade their clones to Tier 2, right?If I melt it, wouldn't I owe him a favor?'Just as King Huai said, I originally came here to find a backer. Now, it seems that these people might be treating me as their backer. Damn, if I accept this favor, I'll still have to be their backer ... I won't do it.'I'd rather not have a clone!The two of them instantly understood many things ... The celestial pole clone couldn't even be bothered to merge with them. He transmitted his voice to King Huai,"I won't do it, I won't melt! We're here to find someone to shelter them from the wind and rain. It seems that we have to shelter them from the wind and rain. It's too troublesome. If we really can't do it, we'll let our avatars fight to the death. It's fine if they die in battle. It doesn't matter anymore!"“……”Just as he was speaking, his clone transmitted a message over,""You two, don't overthink things. Is this sovereign afraid of getting into trouble?"“……”Could the clone hear him?Heaven's Fate thought to himself. The next moment, he came to a realization. 'Damn, I forgot to block it. We're one, but we're not one normally. Now that we're close, we have the same thoughts. We're one. Let's not talk about other things. Even my voice transmission clone might be able to hear it.'

"Cut the crap. Clone, you are me, and I am you. Aren't you afraid of getting into trouble?""I'm afraid!""Then that's it. After the fusion, we're both finished .... If you don 't, you'll have to fight to the death for the favor you've accepted. It's fine if you die, but at least I'm here with my true body!"“……”Was he talking to himself?King Huai was speechless.This guy ..."Enough!" The clone quickly replied,"enough with the nonsense. You're wrong. This is not the Silver Moon King."“……”How was that possible?"I'll know once you melt it. "The clone quickly said,"hurry up! What are you wasting time for? venerable sword is still fighting. Melt me first. I'm too lazy to explain. Quickly melt me and become one!"“……”I won 't!The original body felt that this was a trap. If the clone didn't want to take responsibility, he wouldn't do it either.King Huai was too lazy to care about them. At this moment, escaping was more important.No one knew when the sword Saint would be defeated.Run quickly.BOOM!The warship trembled and rumbled. A powerful aftershock swept over, and the warship was cracking. It was extremely terrifying. The venerable sovereigns 'faces turned pale. It was so powerful. The aftershock of the battle had almost broken through the defenses of many venerable sovereigns.This was too terrifying!At that moment, Lin Hongyu suddenly spoke,""Head north, accelerate!"“……”King Huai was too lazy to respond, and the celestial pole clone suddenly said,""Listen to her, Chaobei, we still have people there!"“……”There's still someone else?The celestial pole's clone was also speechless."I don't believe in you. I've already said that Hong Yitang isn't the Silver Moon King. Unfortunately ... That's right, the Dao master isn't a King. Do you believe me?"I didn't believe it before.I don't believe it, and so does my true body.Forget it. If this guy doesn't merge with me, I won't be able to synchronize my memories. I have no choice but to meet up with Li Hao and the others. Since Lin Hongyu said so, it means that Li Hao and the others are nearby.King Huai had just turned around when his heart suddenly moved.Empyrean terminus's original body's expression also changed slightly as he quickly looked outside.A figure appeared in the void.Empyrean terminus's original body's expression changed slightly.Middle-stage venerable sovereign!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Where did it come from?This is troublesome!At this moment, the seventh-rank was just behind them. Once they were stopped, even if there were so many venerable sovereigns fighting with a middle-rank venerable sovereign, they might not necessarily lose, and might even win ... But once they were stopped, it would be a big problem. "Lord Marquis!""Li Hao!""Supreme Emperor Hao Yue!"“……”At this moment, the Silver Moon Warriors and Li Hao all spoke. In an instant, Qian Wuliang and black Panther appeared and quickly got into the warship. They were two stage 2 experts.Heaven's Fate raised his brows slightly. There were quite a few 2nd rank experts.And ... Who ... Was this person?In addition, he glanced at Qian Wuliang and wondered who this man was.p Why did he feel that he had the same aura as that fifty to sixty-year-old fellow from before?What was going on?Dao master?Where did these two Dao Masters come from?Li Hao glanced at the two of them. He was very familiar with the celestial pole, and so were his clones and his main body. He nodded slightly at the celestial pole and glanced at King Huai. Was this King Huai?The one with the bad reputation?Of course, when King Huai looked at him now, there was a smile on his face, and he seemed to be flattering him ...He was a middle-stage venerable sovereign after all.Li Hao didn't care. He appeared on the warship, looked back, and grabbed the power of the sword intent and the Crimson Moon, leaving a bloody mark on his hand.Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly."Fly towards the Crimson Moon world!""Let's go to the surrounding great worlds and find a safe place to hide!"Li Hao said.King Huai was startled and didn't say anything. This had been their plan all along.Li Hao looked at the two of them again and frowned.""Your origin auras are a little dense and can't be concealed. Enter the Dao River and hide! Qian Wuliang, you and senior uncle Hong will combine the two DAOs and drive the warship together. "King Huai was stunned. He looked at Li Hao, who explained,""When they join forces, they're comparable to a 3rd rank expert, and they're not slow! The aura of the origin is very strong. Even the Crimson Moon knows about the aura of the origin. It's too obvious!"King Huai did not say much and quickly retracted his aura. At this moment, the auras of the two Dao Masters merged. In an instant, a powerful force emerged. At this moment, the two of them were both second level venerable sovereigns. After merging, they were indeed no less than third level.Soon, he took over King Huai's position and began to drive the warship to escape in the direction of the Crimson Moon.Li Hao waved his hand, and his domain appeared.The next moment, the long river surrounded the entire warship. The sky stealing technique was also activated, and in the blink of an eye, the entire warship seemed to have disappeared into the chaos.King Huai and Heaven's Fate were both slightly surprised.This man ... Was a fourth stage venerable sovereign with many tricks up his sleeve. He was not the master of the great Dao, but he had a Dao River and a Dao domain ... Was this the Silver Moon King?The two sides did not communicate.But at this moment, the two finally understood that the clone wasn't lying. Those two weren't the Silvermoon King, this one was!A Tier 4 Silvermoon King!This was somewhat unexpected. The two had expected the Silver Moon King to have reached the 3rd rank. After all, for a King to be at the 4th rank was a bit too fast."The opponent is a seventh rank venerable sovereign. Venerable sword is only a sixth rank venerable sovereign. He seems to be able to put up a fight, but he's only able to resist. If the battle goes on for a long time, he'll definitely lose!""Is the Supreme clone not here?" Li Hao asked.King Huai hurriedly said,"yes, but we lost him. He's not too strong. Something might have happened to the Supreme martial artist, so he took away a part of his power. He didn't send a large amount of power. It's only at the fifth level. He's in the battle. He might be looking for an opportunity to help venerable the sword escape when he's defeated."

Chapter 2825 We're Different (1)_4
In an instant, he told them what he had guessed, including the fact that the sovereign clone was still there but did not follow them. He guessed that it was to help sword venerable escape.Rank 7 venerable sovereign!There was a 99% chance that he would not be able to kill a sword venerable. If he could not kill one, he could only escape.Li Hao quickly calculated. He definitely couldn't deal with a seventh-rank.This was without a doubt! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "However, once venerable the sword is defeated ... It will be troublesome. The seventh rank venerable sovereign will definitely come after us. If he's not after venerable the sword, he'll be after them. If venerable the sword has escaped, the other party may not be able to catch up. We'll be in trouble then.With a slight thought, he consumed a portion of his energy and a brand appeared in the long river.In the next moment, Li Hao sent a message, busy?"Let's watch the show! Wushan doesn't open the realm gate and is currently confronting several tier 7 experts. It looks like a war is about to break out. "The empty voice reverberated.Li Hao didn't waste any time and quickly said,"Dao chess can teleport people. It can teleport me away from the chaos, but it can also teleport you here!" Have you reached the sixth step?""We're here!""Do you have the resources that were teleported here? Venerable sword is dealing with a seventh level Crimson Moon cultivator. Are you interested in joining?"“……”……Tian Fang.Kong Ji was a little dazed and didn't say anything.艹!Is he crazy?What was this guy saying?Venerable the sword is fighting. This guy seems to want me to join in and kill a rank seven?In the next moment, Li Hao's voice rang out again."Use the Nirvana world to conceal your movements. Use the power of recovery to help venerable the sword recover. He's now at the sixth stage. You can help him recover!" As for me ... I'll also join in. This is a rare opportunity!""Are we really going to play this big?"He had originally wanted to take part in Tian Fang's Affairs.However, Li Hao's idea was ... There were too many advanced heaven cultivators, and it was meaningless to play there. He decided to go to the Crimson Moon."Can't you play a little bigger? If we can kill him, we can go play near the Crimson Moon. There are many big worlds and small and medium worlds nearby, and they are all my enemies. They can all be destroyed and destroyed. Only the Dao of Nirvana is interesting in the Crimson Moon. If the tianfang great path universe can't be opened, what are we waiting for?""This ... Good! Then I'll inform Wushan and have him open the door to fight and cover up the movements of the Dao chess pieces. We should be able to teleport over and try to get some benefits in advance ... But ..."Kong Ji thought for a moment and quickly said,"I'm familiar with you. Can you guarantee that neo martial art won't sell to me?"He wasn't afraid of joining in the fun. If he was, he wouldn't enter the sixth step so quickly, but rather take it slow.He also believed that Li Hao would not betray him. He was afraid that the people of new martial arts would be unscrupulous and sell his identity in order to drag light down. At that time, he would drag the world of light down.He didn't care.Li Hao was silent for three seconds, then said, I'll be the guarantor! "If neo martial sold you out ... You're the person I called over, that's the same as selling me out. In the future, I don't owe neo martial anything. If the divine light world is dragged into this, kill me first. Of course, my life may not be more valuable than the divine light world being dragged into this ... But that's all I can do.""Sure, I trust you!"Kong Ji didn't say anything.He was not familiar with neo martial.He was familiar with Li Hao. Since Li Hao was his guarantor, once neo martial arts sold his identity, he would go with Li Hao to hunt neo martial artists.This thought flashed through his mind. He quickly looked at Supreme Emperor Yao yang beside him. Wu Shan had let him in, but Wu Shan didn't let anyone from the red moon region in. According to Wu Shan, this was the tianfang region's business. The red moon region should get lost and not enter!"Uncle yaoyang, do you have the source of light?""What?""Lend me one!"The brilliant sun Sovereign glanced at him but didn't say anything. This thing was very precious. Of course, it was of limited use to him. As a high-leveled venerable sovereign, he was qualified to distribute it. He did have one.It could instantly recover the strength of a fifth or sixth-ranked cultivator. One could imagine how precious it was.However, there was no need to say anything about borrowing the void."There are!"He took out something that looked like a crystal ball. Kong Ji quickly took it and said,""Uncle yaoyang, it's boring here. I'm going back!"With that, he turned around and left.Thearch Yao yang was stunned.Boring?He went back?This is boring?A few tier 7 experts were about to fight, and this was still boring?You're going back ... Where are you going?Strange!Just as he was thinking, he seemed to sense something in the next moment, and his expression changed slightly. Where were they going?Why are you running to Wushan?You're not afraid of death!Of course, Wu Shan wouldn't kill him rashly, but ... It would be too dangerous.……Wu Shan was still drinking tea near the realm gate when a voice suddenly came to his ear."Senior, please fulfill the contract. If you attack now, you won't have to kill anyone, just create a huge commotion!"Wu Shan was startled. Big movement?How old?"How big?""It's so great that even if the heavens and earth were to shake, one would only think that it was caused by your fight. "Heaven and earth were shaking?He quickly thought about it. In the next moment, he felt a little suspicious and transmitted a message,""The world is shaking ... Could it be that that guy is going to return to tianfang through the Dao chess?""No."p "You're not?"If it wasn't because of this, then what was the reason?He was a little confused and quickly guessed."Are you going out? what's the use of going out? you still have to deal with the seventh rank and sneak attack the two red Moon sovereigns from behind?"He could crush you in a one-on-one battle, let alone two.This thought flashed through his mind ... However, he had made an agreement with Li Hao. Since Li Hao had said it, it was considered a done deal ... It didn't seem too bad. In this case, he would have one less problem.

"Yes! When was that?""Immediately!"Wushan was somewhat surprised. Was he in such a hurry?Alright!Without saying anything, he suddenly opened the realm gate. Outside the realm gate, the two red Moon sovereigns were still shouting at him, asking him to open the gate.The next moment, the realm gate opened.Before they could say anything, a cloud of mist suddenly surrounded the sky and earth. In the blink of an eye, the sky and earth were spinning. The two seventh rank venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed slightly, and they lost track of each other.Not good!Wu Shan had actually made a move."A mere Crimson Moon dares to be so presumptuous in my tianfang region!"It was like a Thunderbolt, causing the heavens to collapse and the earth to crack!In an instant, a huge great Dao universe descended. A giant walked out of the sky and slapped down. The chaos turned into a sea of fog and mountains of clouds. Everyone was dizzy, and the chaos seemed to have become a paradise!BOOM!Two red moons emerged from the clouds, and Ji Huo's angry voice sounded,""Wushan, you're crazy!"One against two!And he attacked without any hesitation. Did he really not take me seriously?Did he really think that Red Moon Emperor was a vegetarian?Two tier 7 experts!You even dare to directly attack!Wu Shan didn't say a word. His hand covered the sky, and that big hand instantly turned into mountains. The five fingers turned into a huge curtain that covered the sky. The next second, they turned into five huge mountains, standing in the sea of clouds.The sea of clouds surrounded the two red moons.Wu Shan stretched out his hand and five giant pillars instantly pressed down on the two venerable sovereigns!Suppression!It was like the five-fingered demon-suppressing monkey in the legends!"Bastard!"The two red Moon thearchs were furious. They were both at the seventh rank. Even if Wu Shan was a little stronger, there was a limit to his strength. Since he dared to fight two of them at once, they would not be polite.BOOM!The two red moons instantly charged into the world. The five Finger Mountain was shattered in the blink of an eye, and a sea of mist surrounded the area. A great battle erupted, completely out of everyone's expectations.How did this happen?Had Wushan gone mad?He attacked immediately. Was this the cloud divine world? was there an expert coming?……At the same time. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Dark Demon Ridge.Kong Ji quickly entered the temple and took out a large number of Dao crystals. He shouted,""Senior, do me a favor and teleport me to Li Hao. Take it as my reward of 5000 cells in advance!"He had been too busy recently and didn't have the time to play chess.Last time, he had left after walking to more than 4000 squares.The shadow appeared and looked at him, sighing,""Are you all crazy?"The Phantom could detect their voice transmissions. After all, the Dao chess piece itself was the key to the transmission.Li Hao is crazy. Are you crazy too? He asked you to kill a tier 7, and you followed him. Are you an idiot?"Senior, can I pay in advance?" Kong Ji smiled. If he could, he would teleport. If he couldn 't, then forget it! If you really can't ... I'll advance 6000 cells in one go. How about two chances?"As for whether he could kill them or not ... How would he know if he didn't try?A sword venerable against a seventh rank!How interesting would that be?Watching a fight between high-ranked venerable sovereigns here was no fun. It would be more interesting to fight a seventh-rank venerable sovereign directly. If they succeeded, it would be incredible.If he failed ... He would just have to think about it later.I failed, and Hongyue didn't die. So what if she knows I'm involved?Red Moon might pretend that she didn't know!After all, if he knew, he would have to deal with Guangming, who was not a soft persimmon.Kong Ji instantly thought of many things.A sixth-rank sword venerable. He was a sixth-rank sword venerable. Li Hao was most likely a fourth-rank sword venerable. He would go alone. This time, he would mainly be an assistant. The key was the sword venerable. If he succeeded ... With the experience of killing a seventh-rank sword venerable, it would be of great help to his cultivation.Cultivation, cultivation, cultivation, it was not enough to just cultivate without practice."You've paid 5000 slots in advance. If you die, I'll lose out ..."The mysterious man didn't try to persuade him anymore. After a while, he said,""Forget it. You and that person ... Perhaps not both of you are dead. Even if only one of you is alive, it would be fine! You guys are really arrogant!"With that, the divine Hall trembled. In an instant, a chessboard seemed to have appeared between heaven and earth.Large amounts of Dao crystals were instantly absorbed.The dark Demon Ridge trembled slightly. However, at this moment, even the sky and the earth were shaking. Near the realm gate, three level Seven venerable sovereigns were fighting. What was this slight tremble?As for Kong Ji, he was instantly teleported away.Space magic!This was the spatial teleportation technique, and this was tianfang world.The commotion wasn't as big as he had imagined.Kong Ji instantly disappeared from tianfang world.Wu Shan, who was in the middle of the battle, seemed to have sensed a slight fluctuation. The others didn't care, but he did. In an instant, his eyes moved. He had teleported away!This guy had gone to the Silver Moon King!What was he doing? He wasn't sure, but he was very confused and strange.Kong Ji had originally wanted to stay in Tian Fang to see if there was a chance, but he had run away!……At the same time.In the chaos, outside Tian Fang.All of a sudden, a blade-wielding youth turned his head and looked in a certain direction. He frowned slightly and his eyes flickered."Teleport?"Teleportation through the primordial chaos!What was going on?Who could do this?The master of Tian Fang?Yes, he seemed to know the master of Tian Fang.Frowning slightly, he had wanted to slash at it to see ... But after thinking for a moment, he decided not to. If there really was a level 9 teleportation ... He couldn't afford to provoke it for the time being. He had to keep a low profile. Against Level 7 and level 8, he could be a little more arrogant. There was no need to be afraid of them!"But grade-9 ... If the Lord of Tian Fang is really still around, and he really was the one who teleported ... Then I'll be blind for once and pretend I didn't see anything.

Chapter 2827 We're Different (1)_6
However, he was slightly confused. Was he really the master of tianfang?Also, the direction of the teleportation ... Was it the Crimson Moon region?At this moment, he seemed to be able to distinguish the direction.……On the battleship.When Li Hao received a reply, he immediately came.Li Hao exhaled.If he had not witnessed the recovery power of the void, if he had not seen the battle between venerable the sword and a class 7 spiritual master, he would not have thought about it.But since he knew ... Since he had a chance, he would naturally seize it.His ability to resuscitate was too weak, but Kong Ji could. He had been at the fifth-rank before, but he was now at the sixth-rank. Kong Ji could recover Li Hao's pseudo-seventh-rank power. Venerable the sword was strong, but he was still at the sixth-rank, so Kong Ji had a high chance of doing the same.With Kong Ji, if he came to the Nirvana realm and worked with venerable sword, there was still hope of dealing with a seventh rank venerable sovereign.And he ... This time, he might have a chance.He didn't say anything and just waited in silence.The battleship was still fleeing."Stop!" Li Hao suddenly said.Without saying anything, Qian Wuliang stopped.King Huai and Heaven's Fate looked at each other, not understanding why they had to stop. The two of them were still communicating through voice transmission. A Tier 4 Big Shot, could he lie down for a while?Before they could come to a conclusion ... They suddenly stopped.The next moment, Li Hao's River appeared. In an instant, the river trembled, and a spatial fluctuation appeared in the river. Everyone was dumbfounded.The next moment, a person appeared.Emptiness! An empty space appeared. With a smile, he looked at Li Hao and walked out of the river without looking at the others. "That's pretty accurate!"After saying that, he extended his senses outward and took a slight breath."The neo martial Swordmaster, you live up to your reputation!""Do you feel it?" Li Hao nodded."Of course!""Can you do it?"Kong Ji laughed,"of course you can!" Since they were already here, if they couldn 't, wouldn't that be a waste of resources and opportunities? By the way, you're responsible for all the consumption this time. We have to figure out that we've consumed a lot of energy this time!"Li Hao nodded."No problem. It's on me."After saying that, he looked at the others."You all retreat first and go near the Crimson Moon world. Don't enter the world for the time being. Wait for my return ... If I don't return, think of a way to escape!"Everyone's expression was grave.Silver Moon and the others seemed to know what he was going to do.King Huai seemed to have guessed it as well. He looked at Li Hao in shock, then at Kong Ji, who had just appeared. On one hand, he was shocked that this person had summoned a fifth or sixth-rank venerable sovereign from somewhere.On one hand, he was shocked ... What were these two people going to do?Before they could ask, Li Hao said,""Kong Ji and I will help Sword Saint kill! The opportunity was too rare. If they missed it this time, it would be hard to get another chance like this. The two seventh rank venerable sovereigns had gone to Tian Fang and were being held back! There are five high level venerable sovereigns in the red moon world, one here and two there. At most, there's only the red moon master and one rank seven venerable sovereign left in the red moon world ... A battle has broken out in Tian Fang, and the red moon might need to send one more person to help ... The red moon master doesn't dare to leave rashly now. He's making a small move, so the chance of killing this person is the most difficult!"He still explained a little more and told them that it was not that dangerous. They only had to deal with this Level Seven or level eight Red Moon master, and there was a high chance that he would not dare to come. Otherwise ... Were they not afraid that their home would be stolen?The most dangerous moment was during the battle, and whether the rank eight master would go crazy and descend forcefully after killing the opponent!King Huai's heart trembled!F * ck!Was that really the case?He had thought so before, and now that he had confirmed it, he instantly thought of something and hurriedly said,""That's too dangerous. Of course, we don't know the Silver Moon King's strength, so we can't say much. But for the Silver Moon King's safety, senior Empyrean pole and I can immediately merge into his ... This ... This River of Dao! On one hand, it can hide the origin aura, and on the other, it can strengthen the Silver Moon King's strength!"Li Hao's path River was not one of those two.This time, he had to take a gamble!He wanted to lie down!A fourth rank venerable sovereign actually ... Actually dared to hunt down a seventh rank venerable sovereign. There was no need to say anything else. Just this point alone was worth them taking a gamble on this Silver Moon King. If they went to lie down, they might be able to make a fortune!As for the danger ... When was it not dangerous?Was neo martial not dangerous?The chaos was not dangerous?Who cares about this!Both were dangerous, so of course he had to fight for greater returns.Li Hao was stunned and shook his head.His long river would not melt anyone else.When King Huai saw this, he was a little disappointed. What a pity!But ... The next moment, he gritted his teeth and said,""Then I'll melt the Dao rivers of these two Dao Masters and eliminate the aura of the origin. This is to prevent being discovered while I'm hiding!"“……”Li Hao was stunned for a moment. He glanced at him, then at the celestial pole, and quickly said,""Up to you ... We'll be leaving first. You guys be careful!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared with the void.The domain emerged, and the Nirvana world emerged.Kong Ji couldn't wait any longer, so he didn't have the time to care about these people.As for King Huai, he watched them leave and then looked at Heaven's Fate. Heaven's Fate's eyes also flickered for a moment. He quickly looked at his clone and said, "Let's merge! Hurry up and merge with the river of the path!"The clone rolled his eyes. I f * cking knew it!Sure enough, he had looked down on Hong Yitang and the others before. Now that Li Hao was here, he didn't say anything at first, but when the two of them decided to join forces to kill a seventh-rank monster ... He didn't care anymore.Do you believe that they will succeed?Of course not!However, melting it now was a timely help. When these people succeeded and killed a level Seven ... Melting it at that time would not be a timely help but a shameless act!Since Li Hao refused, he would settle for the second best. Dual-path universe?It looked pretty good!That's fine!He had barely managed to sneak into the Silver Moon's camp."Since there aren't many venerable sovereigns now, and those three seem to be outsiders, they're probably not as good as us. We're still new martial artists, after all, so we'll naturally be closer with our avatars here. Other than the few native silver Moon people, we're considered veterans with high status.In an instant, the two of them made a decision.Let's melt first!……In the outside world.In the chaos.Kong Ji was slightly nervous, and so was Li Hao. Kong Ji looked at him."Borrowing power?""I can 't!"Borrowing my ass! Chi Yun's physical body had already been melted by him, and he had entered the fourth tier. Where could he borrow power from?Kong Ji frowned slightly. What should he do?Li Hao's strength at the fourth step didn't cause much damage to those at the seventh step.Li Hao smiled."It's alright. Just wait and see!"Kong Ji didn't say anything else. The two of them braved the explosion and flew toward the battlefield. The Nirvana world and domain trembled. At the same time, the sky stealing technique was activated and they rushed over.……Further away.Venerable the sword panted for a while and looked at the seventh grade venerable sovereign opposite him. There were cracks on his body, but he was smiling.Is that enough?The sword Saint was really powerful.If he reached the seventh step, he would definitely not be his match. There was no doubt about it.It's a pity ... Even though you're no longer one sword Hero, it seems that you can only hold on until now.Longevity sword, you're dead!As for Sword Saint, he frowned slightly and looked into the distance. Could those guys escape far away in such a short time?The consumption was too great, he really couldn't beat a Grade 7!Unfortunately, he had no choice but to escape.Unfortunately, if you gave me a little more strength and time to recover, I would grind you to death!Although it was a pity, he had no choice.He also knew that this was a rare opportunity, but since he had missed it ... He would just have to wait for another time. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt He was going to escape!Old Zhang's clone, hurry up and self-destruct so that I can have a chance. Otherwise, it won't be easy for me to escape.Outside the battlefield.An old man's body trembled. He had to prepare to create some commotion to give li Changsheng a chance to escape. Otherwise, if li Changsheng died here, Fang ping would come back and kill him once he found out.The next moment, the avatar suddenly turned around and saw a realm. He was slightly stunned.Who ... Who are these two?"Supreme martial artist senior, let's go in and take a look!" Li Hao said with a smile.Silver Moon King?In an instant, the clone understood.These two guys wanted to go in?From inside, an angry shout suddenly came out,""Kill!"The signal had arrived. The longevity sword was anxious. Why didn't he self-destruct?I can't hold on any longer!The sovereign clone looked at the two of them and quickly nodded.""Be careful ... Young people are indeed different!"How arrogant!Alright, I've seen even more arrogant people.Since he was so confident ... He might as well give it a try.At most, it would change from one to three. It didn't seem like a big deal."If you can't do it, run immediately! Follow li Changsheng. He's experienced in escaping and can even dig holes in the chaos ..."Li Hao and Kong Ji had already entered the battlefield and heard the comforting voice.To be able to burrow through the primordial chaos ... Was that even a compliment?It was really ... A different neo martial!

2828 Chapter 467
Sword ray!Countless sword rays.At this moment, it was as if they were in the middle of a Sea of Swords.10,000 DAOs converged.The sword seemed to have a life of its own.Light or darkness, the broken sword domain and the broken Crimson Moon domain of desire combined together and seemed to form a world, a special desire sword sea.The sword had a life of its own.He had desire!There was greed!What Li Hao saw now was a battle between swords. Some of the swords were corrupted by desire and betrayed their Masters, while the other swords were fighting like loyal guards.There were two Dao domains gathered here.In the Dao domain, a battle broke out. The Tier 6 longevity sword's attack was unparalleled.The seventh rank Red Moon sovereign also had its own unique point. Countless sword essences had changed sides and were fighting against the longevity sword essence.It was clearly a battle between two people, and from the outside, it looked like chaos.However, it was different when he walked in.It was completely different!At this moment, it seemed as if two armies were fighting. There were too many emotions in this battle. Betrayal, defection, Valiance, invincibility, and omnipresent desire were all mixed in."Kill the longevity sword!""You will gain fame, fortune, women, power, and immortality ..."Countless thoughts like this appeared in his mind. Li Hao's thoughts came to a temporary standstill.That was the influence of a seventh level venerable sovereign.If one's will wasn't strong enough, or if one's strength wasn't strong enough, they wouldn't be able to enter this place at all. They would soon be eroded by desire and become Hong Yue's puppet.This was the seventh step!If an ordinary middle-stage venerable sovereign were to deal with this seventh-stage venerable sovereign, regardless of one's strength, one might lose their way the moment they entered. After a short while, they would lose their thoughts and become the other party's puppet or tool.The power of the Crimson Moon did not only affect one's body and thoughts. The key was that this special power of Dao was seeping into the power of Dao. In other words, it was changing one's nature.The great Dao has betrayed you!For venerable sovereigns, what was more serious than the erosion of the great Dao?It was not Li Hao's first time fighting with Red Moon Emperor. He had killed three red Moon emperors, including a rank three and a rank four, when he left the Star Gate.However, on this day, when he encountered a high-level Red Moon Emperor for the first time, Li Hao finally understood why the red moon was a major world, and a top-notch one at that.Hong Yue's Dao didn't seem to be too special.Its attack power seemed average, and there wasn't much mystery to it.However, that was because he did not feel it as deeply before. Today, he had some enlightenment. The power of the Crimson Moon had directly penetrated his great Dao and even his great Dao universe. It had invaded him directly, turning him into a puppet and slave. It had invaded him from the very core ... Was such a Dao not special enough?If a powerful existence invaded a great Dao universe, they could even turn the entire great Dao universe into the Crimson Moon's domain! Wasn't such a Dao strong?Desire was something that no one could escape from. As long as you had desire, you would be penetrated by Hong Yue's great Dao. This was the primitive instinct of living beings. Even if you were really heartless, you would still have desire.No one could Dodge!At this moment, Li Hao and Kong Ji both stopped. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt The two cultivators were both enveloped by the domain. The power of destruction spread and turned the surroundings into a small empty area. A red glow appeared on their faces.That was the effect of the Crimson Moon's power.Before they even entered the battlefield, this seventh rank venerable sovereign had already taught them a lesson. Crazy people like you should maintain basic respect and awe for advanced venerable sovereigns.……At the same time.The seventh rank venerable sovereign who was still fighting against longevity sword puppet frowned slightly and looked outside.The longevity sword also turned its head and took a glance.The two powerhouses had both sensed that someone had entered their battlefield. It was not a very powerful existence, but there were some special existences. When the two of them fought, it was no different from two seventh-rank powerhouses fighting.But now, someone had barged into their battlefield.He was very bold!However, if they were not careful, even a sixth level venerable sovereign might not be able to enter the core circle. Before they could enter, they would be completely crushed and turned into food for the great Dao domain.Who's here?The longevity sword had some speculations because he had sensed a special aura. It felt like ... Sword intent.The sword intent in his bones.That was something that the people of the Silvermoon world were born with. Their Dao meridians were actually a sword. The final shape of their great Dao universe was also a sword.On the other side, Red Moon sovereign was extremely cold.He didn't care!It was not an advanced venerable sovereign.He didn't seem to be from the origin either. The aura of the origin world was extremely clear. It didn't seem to be from the origin. If it was people like the blood Emperor, he would be a little afraid.A sword venerable was already so difficult to deal with. He had to be afraid of the people from neo martial arts.But ... No!Since he was not a high-level venerable sovereign, he did not need to be too afraid. He did not sense the aura of the great Dao in the light and cloud areas. Otherwise, he would be afraid.However, neither Li Hao nor Kong Ji had a Dao universe. Kong Ji didn't have a Dao universe either. His Dao universe was his Nirvana realm. "You don't know what's good for you!"He knew that the person was not from his side.On his side, it could only be the venerable sovereigns of the red moon Jie.Now, there might be venerable sovereigns of the Crimson Moon coming, but there was still some distance between the Crimson Moon world and this place. If a high-level venerable sovereign did not come, it would be difficult for a middle-level venerable sovereign to arrive quickly, no matter how fast he was.

2829 Chapter 467
Since they weren't from his side, they were either from new martial arts or some reckless Rangers who wanted to take advantage of the situation.Those Locust-like Rangers were very bold.As a high-level venerable sovereign, before he met venerable sword, he did not care about any non-high-level venerable sovereigns. Even now, he did not think that there were cultivators like venerable sword in the entire chaos.If that was the case ... Chaos would have long been in a state of chaos.No one could defeat a Grade 7 cultivator like venerable sword in any world.Venerable the sword remained silent.He raised the invisible sword, waved it, and slashed!His sword moves were simple and seemed ordinary. However, those who truly understood him knew that it was not simple. It was a sword formed from 10000 DAOs. In terms of attack, it was almost flawless.No matter what orthodoxy or ability you have, there will always be a sword among my sword of ten thousand DAOs that can kill you!The red moon's venerable sovereign obviously understood this.Even though his Red Moon great Dao had invaded, his opponent's sword Dao was still as stable as Mount Tai. If this person's great Dao power was not strong enough and not as strong as a rank seven, he would have been killed by his opponent if he had encountered him at the same rank!Unparalleled sword!The two sides were going back and forth. At this moment, the only thing Red Moon sovereign could do was wait and defend. He was waiting for his opponent's power of great Dao to be exhausted so that his opponent's sword will could break his own great Dao and he would be killed.As long as he defended well and exhausted his opponent ... Longevity sword would die without a doubt.And he had such confidence.It was fast!The longevity sword was powerful, but it was not powerful enough to kill him with one strike. This was his success.……Outside.The red light on Li Hao's face dissipated, and Kong Ji's face turned ashen.Two domains appeared beside him. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  A sneak attack was obviously impossible.The moment they entered each other's territory, they were exposed. This was a blow to them. If they were ordinary middle-stage venerable sovereigns, they might not even know that they were close to each other.However, a seventh-rank venerable sovereign with a Dao domain would expose themselves if they entered the domain.At the same time, as people with Dao domains, they knew very well who had invaded their Dao domains. They knew very well that someone had come. If it weren't for the fact that their Dao domains were entangled and even somewhat shattered, this powerful Crimson Moon domain could even suppress them!The shock was nothing. The two of them were actually quite excited at the moment.This was the advanced!A true advanced venerable sovereign!This time, be it the two of them, li Changsheng, or venerable Emperor Red Moon, all four of them had their own Dao domains. It was also a kind of experience to walk in the Dao domains of a strong enemy."The Crimson Moon world is not ordinary!"Kong Ji sighed with emotion. He didn't seem to be so nervous. He just sighed."Sure enough, I may have underestimated Hong Yue. I always feel that Hong Yue's path of desire is not elegant."At this moment, he realized that he was wrong. Desire, the primitive way!p This type of Dao was definitely not simple. It was not the type of Dao that could only tempt people. Instead, it was a Dao that could stimulate one's primal desires, from the root, from the source of the Dao, from the depths of the Dao!Li Hao nodded. He was indeed extraordinary.It was no wonder that on the side of neo martial, the human King was so powerful that he could easily kill a seventh level venerable sovereign, but he did not directly attack Hong Yue. According to the neo martial era he traveled to, the peak of the seventh level human King, and the opponent was only at the eighth level ... A peak seventh level human King against an eighth level, would the human King not dare?He dared!However, the human King still hadn't attacked the Crimson Moon. Was he really lost?Or was it because of fear?Red Moon Lord, even among the eighth-rank, should not be simple.Li Hao didn't think too much about it. At this moment, a long river appeared and surrounded him and the void. The stars of Quietus and life and death appeared, and a faint domain of the great Dao enveloped them again.Waves of the power of the Crimson Moon were still madly seeping in.However, the moment they entered, they were completely destroyed by the empty Nirvana world.Even if the two of them joined forces, only some of the power of the great path could do nothing to them. If they couldn't even block this, they should go back as soon as possible, wash up, and sleep. It was simply a fool's dream to try and kill a seventh level venerable sovereign."Continue?"Li Hao looked at Kong Ji, who smiled."Of course!"The next moment, the two of them continued forward.In the surroundings, a large amount of sword intent overflowed, but it didn't attack Li Hao's group. It was just that ... A portion of sword intent that had been invaded by the Crimson Moon's power was like a rebel army, charging toward their domain.However, these chaotic sword intents were mixed with the power of the Crimson Moon. They could be used against weak opponents, but not against the two of them.The rebellious sword essences were quickly destroyed by the river. Some of the stronger ones entered the river and were instantly destroyed by the Nirvana domain.……"What?"At this moment, Red Moon sovereign started to care.Someone's here!Not only did he come, but he also broke the combination of his and the sword venerable's broken Dao domain and walked in from the outside.He wasn't weak!He was also very bold!He knew that it was a battle between seventh-rank spiritual beasts, yet he still dared to participate. He wanted to see who had eaten a bear's heart and a leopard's leopard's gall to be so arrogant!The longevity sword was also a little surprised and surprised.He might have guessed who had come.It was just that ... This was a battle between tier 7 experts. Although he wasn't one, at least in terms of offense and Dao domain, he was half a tier 7 expert. If the new king of Silvermoon came, he would be too bold!Also, someone's strength was out of everyone's expectations.Just as the two of them were somewhat surprised.
