        Chapter 226: Mrs. Qiao (2)

“It’s true!”

Li Hao nodded seriously.”Of course, it’s a secret. It’s mainly because you’ve been complaining, so I had no choice but to reveal it to you. Actually, this matter had nothing to do with you. It’s not within your jurisdiction.”

“But now, I have to say that you’re the third person to know about this. If you leak the secret ... Wang Ming, you’re a traitor!”

Wang Ming’s heart thumped, and he said uncertainly,”What do you mean?”

“There’s actually a tenth person among us night patrollers!”

Wang Ming was startled. The tenth person?

“On the surface, there are only 9 of us. In fact, there’s a high-level hermit in the dark, but I can’t tell you the specific identity. You just need to know that this person exists. ”

Wang Ming wasn’t too sure, and he wasn’t that easy to fool. He frowned.”Really? I’m the Deputy Minister, how come I don’t know anything about this?”

“You can make your own judgment!”

Li Hao said calmly,”I’ll say what I said today. I won’t admit it when I get out!” Even if you tell others that I did, I won’t admit it. Otherwise ... I’ll be a sinner! The identity of this tenth person is special, and it’s not convenient for him to show his face. However, he’s very powerful and is an expert in gathering information. ”

“According to his investigation, some forces are indeed hiding some things today. For example, the Milky Way group not only has a moon Hades master, but there are also three moon Hades Masters!”

Wang Ming’s face changed and he asked in a low voice,”really?” How do you guys keep in contact? I didn’t notice it at all. Li Hao, are you lying to me?”

“It’s true!”

Li Hao nodded seriously,”as for how they contacted each other ... I can’t say!” We naturally have our own methods. You’re not considered our trusted aide yet. You should know that you’ve only been here for a few days. For me to tell you so much, I’ve already broken the rules!”

Wang Ming understood!

He was originally a spy of the demon hunting squad!

But ... Was the other party so powerful?

He couldn’t believe it. Frowning, he looked at Li Hao again. Li Hao reminded him,””Drive properly!”

Wang Ming quickly came back to his senses and immediately continued driving, still in disbelief.”Are you serious? are there really three moon Hades Masters hidden in the Galaxy group? To be honest, there are quite a few Dark Moon elites now, but they’re mainly concentrated in the various large organizations. There aren’t many idle ones. I think it’s normal for one to be in a branch, but three ... That’s not normal. ”

“It’s true!”

Li Hao thought for a moment and said,”moreover, one of them is about as strong as you.”

The main thing was that the light orbs were about the same size.

Li Hao also discovered that he could see the orbs of light as long as they were not too far away from him.

Of course, different powers could see at different distances.

For example, he could see the three yang level from a few thousand meters away. He could still remember the huge ball of light.

As for the sunlight, it could be seen within a thousand meters.

As for Yue Ming, he could only see the ball of light about 100 meters away.

As for the Starlight division ... Li Hao could only see the faint Starlight when they were close enough. It was like a spark, very weak, so ordinary superpowers couldn’t hide from Li Hao.

There were indeed three moon Hades in the Galaxy group, and one of them was even a full moon.

Wang Ming frowned. At this moment, he didn’t think that Li Hao was bluffing. Perhaps he really was deliberately attracting the attention of others to create an opportunity for the tenth person in the dark.

However, there was something he did not understand,’what is this person’s strength? he can quickly determine the other party’s strength without alerting the other party? Could it be an investigative type? That means he’s at least at the Dark Moon level!”

This was the least they could do!

Since when did the demon-hunting squad have a conversation with such a super?

The detective element was still very important, and many organizations liked to recruit them.

Among supers, assault-type supers were not really valued, mainly because there were too many attack-type supers, and it did not matter if there were a few more. On the contrary, supers with special abilities were paid more attention.

For example, Li Meng and Hu Hao were actually more valued.

Although their status wasn’t as high as Wang Ming ‘s, they were actually young talents among the night patrols. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been arranged to protect an important figure like Yuan Shuo.

Li Meng had the third eye and could see through many things that others could not.

Hu Hao could fly, and the position of a soaring super would drop a lot after the level of the sun glory, but before that, they had always been the most important strategic resource.

Supers were generally able to fly when they reached sunlit.

Of course, it would not be too far.

Only when it came to the three suns, when the mysterious energy was sufficient, there would be almost no difficulty in flying.

Li Hao had said that he might have a super who was proficient in both stealth and scouting, so Wang Ming naturally took this very seriously. This was information that even the higher-ups might not know.

At this moment, he felt a little uncomfortable.

Li Hao ... Was so honest that he dared to say anything.

If Liu Long were to find out about this, he would be in deep trouble.

Of course, he, Wang Ming, wasn’t a gossipmonger.

“I can’t say too much,” Li Hao said in a low voice.”I only know that this person can provide us with a lot of information! Old Wang, don’t ask too much. I’m only telling you this because we’re on good terms, and you’re a man of justice ... If you leak this, I’ll be in big trouble. ”

“Don’t worry!”

He nodded, but he was still a little uncertain.””Are you sure the information is accurate?”

Chapter 227: Mrs. Qiao (3)
Translator: 549690339
“One hundred percent!”

Wang Ming took a breath.

The Galaxy group alone had three moon nether’s in hiding and one at the full moon level. What the hell was going on?

Huang Yun had told him to come here, and he had also said that there might be some trouble here ... But he hadn’t thought much of it before, but now he suddenly felt that the Silver City was not safe.

“In all the major forces, sunlight is a high-level force and will not take risks rashly! Existences at the full moon realm are all working hard to enter the sunlit realm. Therefore, the number of active powerhouses today is usually limited to a full moon!”

After explaining to Li Hao, he quickly said,””If there is really a full moon level ... Then the Galaxy group’s purpose is not pure! Just for self-protection, one Yue Ming is enough. Under normal circumstances, others won’t rashly attack these big companies!”

Li Hao nodded.

At that moment, Wang Ming was quiet.

Li Hao didn’t say anything else.

The car slowly came to a stop.

They had arrived at the Qiao’s mining headquarters.

……

At the front desk.

Li Hao’s group wasn’t barred from entering. The front desk made a phone call, and Qiao Peng quickly led a few staff members downstairs to receive Li Hao and his group.

“Patrol li!”

Qiao Peng looked like he was in his thirties, which was considered young.

If one were to ignore the embarrassing state he was in when he was handcuffed by Liu Yan yesterday, he would still look like a promising young man.

At this moment, Qiao Peng was wearing a formal suit and was quite tall. He greeted Li Hao with a smile, then looked at Wang Ming and said with a smile,”Sir, what’s your name?”

Li Hao wasn’t as kind as the previous families. He said impolitely,””Minister Wang! A Big Shot from the White moon City! President Qiao, your Qiao’s mining company is well-informed, surely you know about it?”

Wang Ming was a little surprised. Li Hao was a very kind person, and the first few companies had all been very polite. Even if the Galaxy group had hidden the information, he hadn’t said anything.

Why did his face turn black when he arrived here?

Qiao Peng didn’t mind and smiled.”Investigator li, my Qiao’s mining industry only has some Foundation in the Silver City. Whitemoon city is a big city, and our Qiao’s mining industry is only average there ... How could we know too much about a transcendent organization like the night patrolmen? you’ve overestimated me.”

When he saw Wang Ming’s puzzled look, he quickly explained,”I have some misunderstandings with patrol li. It’s mainly because of Captain Liu. I’m over thirty years old, and my father has been urging me to find someone to marry. My taste ... Is a bit high. In the huge Silver City, to be honest, I only like Captain Liu. Yesterday, Captain Liu was a little unhappy with me. If patrol li saw it, he would probably think that I’m a bit embarrassing for being clingy. ”

He spoke so frankly that Wang Ming seemed to understand something.

Liu Yan and Li Hao ... In any case, during yesterday’s meal, there was something unusual between Liu Yan and Li Hao. Liu Yan’s words often made people’s imagination run wild.

He finally understood why Li Hao was unhappy.

Li Hao, Oh Li Hao, you ... Liu Yan should be 30, right? you’re only 20. You really have the heart to do it ... That’s right, men all like this, especially young women.

He seemed to know the key point and smiled.”President Qiao, I’m fine! As long as it’s a proper and reasonable pursuit ... Of course, I believe that President Qiao won’t do anything inappropriate. Captain Liu is the beauty of our Inspection Division. If she really did something out of line, we won’t let it go!”

After saying that, he gently nudged Li Hao.

Li Hao’s face was still a little unhappy, but he didn’t say much. He said coldly,””Alright, this is a matter between you and sister Liu. I won’t get involved! But, I’m warning you, don’t think that you’re so good just because you’re the Vice President of Qiao’s mining! Now, there are some things that you all know very well. It’s not the era where money is everything, so you better be honest!”

Qiao Peng helplessly spread his hands,”this is a big misunderstanding. Of course, if inspector li feels that it’s inappropriate ... I’ll withdraw?” But ... That’s not good. I think it’s best to have a fair competition when it comes to love. ”

Li Hao’s face was cold,”who wants to compete with you fairly?” If you continue to talk nonsense, I won’t be polite to you!”

“Then just take it that I’m talking nonsense, don’t be angry!”

Qiao Peng laughed.”Patrol li is young and promising, and we’re all people of Silver City. There’s no need to be like this. If I’ve done anything wrong, I’ll treat you to a meal if you have time. Some things are all in the wine!”

“Let’s talk again!”

Li Hao was not too polite. He said coldly,”I want to register the information of all the extraordinary martial masters and supers. Your Qiao’s mine is a big business. Don’t say you don’t have it!” In addition, I’m going to inspect all the stores, mines, and office buildings of your Qiao’s enterprise! In addition, I’ve already sent someone to deliver the Super detector, don’t think you can hide it from me!”

“All of them need to be registered. Anyone who isn’t on the register will be regarded as a criminal!”

“……”

Qiao Peng cursed in his heart. He was using a chicken feather as a token of authority!

He had inquired about this guy in the previous few shops and they were all just going through the motions. Good Lord, now that he was here, he was patrolling and had a super detector.

Of course, it seemed normal for one to be in the prime of one’s youth and gain power overnight.

And it was for Liu Yan!

As expected, it was the hardest for such a young man to resist a mature woman like Liu Yan. He cursed in his heart,”these two B * stards might have already started rolling around in bed. What a slut!”

However, it was also because of this that he felt that Li Hao was too unscrupulous.

The targets were all on the face!


Chapter 228: Mrs. Qiao (4)
Translator: 549690339
This kind of person was easy to deal with.

If they really met and let go of all grudges with a smile, he would feel that it was inappropriate. As a man, he understood men too well.

If there were other men pursuing his woman and pestering her ... He would not be polite!

The more this was the case, the more at ease he felt.

This also proved that Liu Yan really didn’t know anything. Otherwise, she would have advised Li Hao not to go against her and secretly target him.

His expression did not change as he thought of this, but he also revealed a slightly helpless look.””Patrol li, is there a need to do this? They’re all from our hometown. I heard that ... You went to the Milky Way ...”

Li Hao said coldly,”the Milky Way is the Milky Way, and the Qiao Corporation is the Qiao Corporation!” President Qiao, I have reason to suspect that you are hiding some fugitive. I’m a local, so I know the mine very well. The mine is underground and there are no strangers all year round. It’s easy to hide criminals in these places!”

“If you say this to me again, I’ll directly place the Qiao’s as a key observation target!”

With power in his hands, Li Hao could turn on the heir of a large corporation at any time.

Qiao Peng had also learned some information about Li Hao, but he still couldn’t help but curse.

A dog taking advantage of its master’s power!

Previously, he was honest and well-behaved, but now that he had gained power, he changed his face faster than turning the pages of a book.

He showed slight dissatisfaction, but it was not too obvious. He nodded reluctantly and said,””Alright, you can investigate! However, I must remind patrol li that Silver City isn’t a place where some people can do whatever they want ... Patrol Li, you shouldn’t ruin the reputation of the Nightwatchers!”

Li Hao snorted in disdain.

He didn’t waste any time and directly entered the elevator. He said to Wang Ming,”Minister Wang, keep an eye on the ground and don’t let anyone leave! I’ll go through them layer by layer with the Super detector. I’ll check their headquarters first, then go to the mines and retail stores. ”

“You come with me!” He turned to Qiao Peng.

Qiao Peng frowned but didn’t say anything. He brought the others and entered the elevator with him.

The Qiao’s headquarters was very tall, with a full 30 floors. In the current Silver City, it was considered the highest building. There weren’t many high-rise buildings in the Silver City, and under normal circumstances, most of them were five or six stories tall.

He went straight to the top floor.

Li Haozhen took out a super detector. It was not small, slightly bigger than a watermelon. There was a display on it, and once there were super fluctuations, it would show a red dot.

Li Hao turned on the switch. This thing also consumed mysterious energy, and under normal circumstances, it wouldn’t be used easily.

“There’s a reaction!”Li Hao said with a frown as soon as he opened it.

Qiao Peng said helplessly,”investigator li, our Qiao’s never said that we don’t have supers. The Qiao’s have supers, and not just one, but three Starlight Masters. I’m not trying to hide it. You just won’t listen to me.”

Li Hao was a little embarrassed, but he quickly regained his indifference.”I said there’s a reaction. Why are you so excited?”

After saying that, he frowned slightly and looked at the Super monitor.”You have three Starlight Masters?”

“Right!”

“But there are eight red dots on it ...”

Qiao Peng laughed,”do you think I don’t know anything, inspector li?” This super detector can only detect the Super energy fluctuations within its range. It can’t tell how many people there are ... What eight red dots, are you sure you’re not seeing things?”

Li Hao was even more annoyed, what do you know! This is the night patrolman’s latest super detector. If I say eight, then eight. Qiao Peng, don’t be so cheeky with me, I’m watching you!”

“As you wish!”

As they spoke, the elevator stopped and they reached the top floor.

There were only two large offices on this floor.

One of them belonged to Qiao Peng, and the other was his father ‘s.

Li Hao went straight to the Office of the President of the Qiao ‘S. Qiao Peng frowned and said,””That’s my father’s office. He’s busy. Li Hao, don’t go too far ...”

“Cut the crap!”

Li Hao was a little arrogant. He lowered his voice and said,””Qiao Peng, you and I had no grudges! However, your mistake was that you shouldn’t have kept harassing sister Liu! Her husband died in your mine, and I didn’t even bother to say anything. You, on the other hand, killed her husband and still dare to target sister Liu. Let’s wait and see!”

Qiao Peng cursed under his breath and frowned.”You can’t just say things like that. Li Hao, don’t slander me. That was an accident. The inspection Office has already concluded the case.”

“Hmph!”

Li Hao pushed the door open and entered. At this moment, an old man in the office raised his head and looked at Li Hao.

He then looked at Qiao Peng with a questioning look.

Qiao Peng quickly stepped forward and whispered a few words to the old man. The old man stood up and laughed,””Nice to meet you, patrol li! I’m quite familiar with your teacher, professor Yuan. I didn’t expect to see you here, inspector li. You’re indeed professor Yuan’s favorite student. ”

“You’re too polite!”

Li Hao barely managed to reply. He walked around with the detector and didn’t make any small talk.

The old man didn’t stop him. He just looked at Li Hao with a smile.

At this moment, Li Hao’s heart was in turmoil!

He really didn’t notice anything outside.

He had noticed that there was an expert in the Qiao clan, even as soon as he had entered the door. That guy was very bold and was just nearby Qiao Peng. He was a moon Hades master, and he felt that he was a little stronger than Wang Ming, possibly on the level of Yue Ying.

Of course, even so, Li Hao didn’t lose his composure.

However, at this moment, he was a little out of control. However, he took the opportunity to investigate and frowned, so it was not obvious.

Chapter 229: Mrs. Qiao (5)
Translator: 549690339
The one who had lost his composure was the old man in front of him, Qiao Peng’s father.

Blizzard Silver city’s business legend, Qiao Feilong.

A legendary entrepreneur who was over 70 years old and built the Qiao’s mining industry from scratch with his bare hands.

Li Hao didn’t even lose his composure before he pushed the door open.

However, when he saw the other party ... He was so shocked that he broke out in cold sweat.

A ball of light!

Yes, it was a ball of light that was almost invisible through the door.

The moment he opened the door, Li Hao felt like he was going blind.

艹!

Li Hao felt that the ball of light was slightly weaker than Divine Master Duan Tian, but not by much.

Three yang?

Peak of the sunlit realm?

Why couldn’t he sense it from the outside? it should be known that this ball of light couldn’t be blocked by matter. It was a kind of overflowing energy, and Li Hao could see through it.

But he didn’t see it before!

What did this mean?

It meant that the old man in front of him had completely concealed his energy fluctuations. Li Hao only saw the energy in the old man’s body appear when he saw him with his own eyes. Moreover, it hadn’t leaked out yet.

His control and concealment of energy had even reached the level of a Martial Master.

However, a Martial master’s energy came from their own cultivation, so it was normal for it to be inconspicuous.

However, the energy of supers was almost all external and absorbed. It was impossible to hide it so perfectly ... Unless there was a super item that Li Hao used to hide it!

“Qiao Feilong is actually a powerhouse at the peak of the radiant sun realm or even the three sun realm!”

It was unbelievable!

Li Hao really didn’t expect this. He thought that even if the Qiao mining company was a peripheral organization of Yama, Qiao Feilong was only there to help them accumulate wealth.

However, the facts proved that it was not that simple.

Would a peak stage sunlit realm or even a three-sun realm powerhouse be just a simple money-making tool?

It was hidden so perfectly!

Li Hao continued to look around with the detector. He calculated in his mind and was a little shocked.

“Aside from Qiao Feilong, there’s still one Yue Ying and three Starlight Masters on the surface ... This is only the headquarters, what about the other places?”

The Qiao family was much stronger than he had imagined.

According to Li Hao’s guess, it was already good enough that they had Yue Ming. The peak of the full moon realm might be their greatest trump card. However, because Yuan Shuo was in the city, Li Hao was not afraid of anything.

“Investigator li, are you done?”

At this moment, Qiao Peng also seemed a little impatient. It would be too fake if he remained indifferent to Li Hao’s provocation.

“What’s the hurry?”Li Hao said impatiently.

After saying this, he turned to Qiao Feilong and said,”President Qiao, I’m a junior. I shouldn’t be so reckless!” But President Qiao is a legend in Blizzard Silver City. I think that President Qiao is too busy with his career and has forgotten to educate his children!”

“What do you mean by that, inspector li?” Qiao Feilong smiled kindly.

“This Qiao Peng!”

Li Hao pointed at Qiao Peng and said,”he’s got some guts!” Liu Yan is the leader of my night patrolman operation team, a high-ranking official of the inspector level! This Qiao Peng, he’s been speaking frivolously in front of everyone, and has been ridiculing us time and time again!”

Li Hao seemed a little annoyed,”bullying a widow, is that very shameful?” It’s true that the night patrolman division has just been established, but it’ll be as easy as blowing off dust for me to destroy your Qiao family! Now, with the rise of superpowers and your family’s business, if you don’t act carefully and let this person cause trouble, I think something will happen sooner or later!”

Qiao Feilong’s expression remained the same. After a moment, he nodded slightly. “You’re right! Qiao Peng has indeed been pampered since he was born ... So it’s because of this. Rest assured, investigator li, Qiao Peng won’t bother Captain Liu anymore after this!”

“Dad!”

Qiao Peng was a little displeased. Qiao Feilong said sternly, “You’re already in your 30s, but you don’t have any sense of propriety at all! Investigator li is young, but I feel that what he said today is extremely reasonable! The rise of supers, you’re not thinking of ways to become a superhuman, you’re always stirring up trouble for women!”

After saying that, he looked at Li Hao and said,”it’s better to squash enmity than keep it alive. Qiao Peng doesn’t know his limits. Captain Liu might not be willing to see me. I’ll apologize to her on Qiao Peng’s behalf. May I trouble patrol li to pass the message on?” Also, prepare a small gift ...”

Li Hao waved his hand.”Forget it. I don’t need it!”

“Make your decision after you hear it out, investigator li.”

Qiao Feilong laughed,”after all, the Qiao’s is a well-known Local Enterprise. The establishment of a branch in Silver City is also a form of protection for local enterprises!” Plus, I also know a thing or two about Captain Liu’s matter, her husband died in an accident ... But, after all, he’s a member of our Qiao ‘s, so I’m very apologetic to have died in such a way. ”

“I know that Captain Liu has been looking for a breakthrough to become a superpower. The Qiao’s are not involved in the field of superpowers and it’s a pity that we can’t let her advance! However, a few days ago, we collected 10 cubic meters of mysterious energy from the White moon City. It was originally for Qiao Peng to advance into a super, but Qiao Peng didn’t know his limits. I’m worried that he will cause even more trouble after advancing ... Why don’t we give it to Captain Liu as a gift?”

Li Hao had wanted to refuse, but he felt a little embarrassed. After a while, he snorted and said,”” 10 cubic meters? This ... Isn’t this too precious?”

“Human lives are greater than the heavens!”

Qiao Feilong sighed.”It’s also good for me to feel a little more at ease. I’m just doing what I can!”

“That ... Sister Liu might not want it ...”

Li Hao was a little conflicted.

“It doesn’t matter. If Captain Liu doesn’t want it ... Then just throw away patrol li!”

Qiao Feilong sighed and said,”the Qiao family is still able to take out this little bit of things and can afford to lose them.” I only hope that Captain Liu can be at ease, and that this old man can be at ease as well. ”


Chapter 230: Mrs. Qiao (1)(2)
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao struggled for a while. At this moment, Qiao Feilong gestured, and very quickly, someone came up with a box.

“This box is also an energy storage box that was passed over from the central region! It has the effect of storing mysterious energy, and there are some ice crystals inside. 10 cubic meters of mysterious energy is inside, but it’s all fire energy. I don’t know if it’s suitable for Captain Liu. ”

Li Hao subconsciously caught it. It wasn’t heavy, but he still pressed his arm a little. He was a little reluctant and conflicted.”This ... Then ... I’ll take it? If sister Liu doesn’t want it ... I’ll return it to you. ”

“No need. If she doesn’t want it, just throw it away!”

Li Hao gritted his teeth, somewhat embarrassed.””Then ... Then I’ll keep it. If she doesn’t want it, I’ll throw it away ...”

“As you wish!”

Li Hao smiled and said hurriedly,””Then I’ll have to trouble you this time. President Qiao is my idol, I’m really sorry for being impolite! In the future, when I’m performing my duties in Silver City, I’ll have to rely on President Qiao for a lot of things ... As long as Qiao Peng doesn’t harass sister Liu, I won’t deliberately make things difficult for the Qiao’s ... In fact, I didn’t want to make things difficult for them, but Qiao Peng went too far!”

At the side, Qiao Peng was cursing in his heart.

How have I gone overboard?

This bastard was greedy for money!

Wasn’t it just for women?

Why did he have to find so many excuses? now that he had given her the good stuff, he was still pretending that he was the one who caused the trouble. He was really speechless.

At such a young age, he was already good at using bureaucratic jargon.

As expected of a fellow from the Silver City’s ancient Academy. He was so eloquent with his words.

Qiao Feilong also responded with a smile.

Li Hao said awkwardly,”well ... The mine still needs to be checked. But don’t worry, President Qiao. It’s just a formality. Qiao Peng will accompany me. I’ll just watch from the outside. The higher-ups ‘tasks must be checked properly!” You don’t need to bring the Super detector. I believe President Qiao won’t make things difficult for me. ”

“Of course!”

Qiao Feilong laughed: “patrol li is also a wonderful person. If you have time in the future, you can come to the Qiao’s at any time. This Qiao welcomes you with open arms!”

“Then I won’t bother you anymore!”

Li Hao walked out happily and said,””Qiao Peng, you should learn more from the old man. I’ll be waiting for you downstairs. Old man, don’t be too harsh on him.”

“Hahaha, good, good, good, I will teach him a lesson!”

Qiao Feilong laughed heartily. After Li Hao left, he waited until Li Hao entered the elevator and went downstairs before he retracted his smile. He glanced at Qiao Peng and slightly frowned.”Acting should also be done in moderation! She clearly knew that Li Hao was interested in Liu Yan, but she still insisted on getting involved. Wasn’t this clearly offending him? Go, accompany him to the mine. Remember, don’t let him walk around, and you too!”

“Understood!”

“Go!”

Qiao Peng didn’t dare to say anything more and quickly walked out.

After he left, Qiao Feilong considered for a moment and said,””Did you sense anything special?”

“No, it’s very ordinary. However, he should have absorbed some mysterious energy. I feel that his physique is not bad, and the toughness of his skin seems to be very good ... He might have entered the tenth realm.”

“It’s normal!”

Qiao Feilong didn’t think much of it. “He’s yuan Shuo’s student, and he’s also absorbed the mysterious energy. With the new five birds book in hand, and it’s said that he’s also learned the five birds breathing technique, it’s only a matter of time before he enters the ten slashing realm!”

“Boss, do you think ... There’s something special about his blood?” the man asked in a low voice.

“Maybe it’s not just pure blood, but the so-called bloodline ... It needs to be extracted from blood and not just bleeding directly!”

Qiao Feilong said a few words, then waved his hand.”Alright, let’s put it aside for now! The Silver City is currently unstable, so don’t cause any trouble and wait for the right time!”

“Alright,” he said.

The exchange ended just like that.

……

At the same time.

Li Hao went downstairs, his face full of smiles, but his heart was still in shock.

Was it the three yang?

Now that the teacher did not have the help of the sword, could he kill the three suns?

Also, if he killed this three suns, would he be able to obtain a large amount of mysterious energy?

What system?

He was a little confused. He didn’t expect this old man to have hidden so deeply.

“He must have some treasure on him!”

Li Hao thought to himself. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to hide the fluctuations of the mysterious energy so well. He didn’t feel it at all. It even seemed that he had completely concealed it in his body.

“We’ve caught a big fish!”

This must be a big fish, Li Hao thought. Besides, he had been staying in the Silver City all this time. Logically speaking, even a god tier master would find it difficult to make a breakthrough if he didn’t go out to battle or travel.

For example, Yuan Shuo had been wandering around when he was young, which was why he was able to step into the Qian warrior realm in one day.

Not anyone who had enough mysterious energy could become a sunshine or three suns just by sitting and absorbing it.

“Could it be ... The benefits from my family’s ancestral grave?”

At this moment, Li Hao thought of this.

He suddenly felt extremely distressed!

Bastard!

‘This guy must have dug up his ancestors’ graves and obtained some benefits. That’s why he was able to advance to the peak of the radiant sun realm or even the three suns realm in Silver City. Damn it, this guy took advantage of me. ‘

Moreover, the possibility of this was extremely high.

There was a 100% chance that there was a problem with the other party’s mine.

Unfortunately, this was not the time to alert the enemy.

However, this trip wasn’t considered a wasted one. He had already discovered Qiao Feilong’s strength, and he had also obtained 10 cubic meters of mysterious energy, which could be considered an unexpected gain. This was enough.

“Li Hao!”

At this moment, Wang Ming glanced at Li Hao. Seeing the box in his hand, his eyes moved slightly.”An energy storage box?”


Chapter 231: Mrs. Qiao (7)
Translator: 549690339
“You know him?”

“Of course!”

“You received gifts again?” Wang Ming frowned a little.

Forget about the small gifts, he even accepted mysterious energy.

He had already forgotten how he had thought that Li Hao was too petty and that he would either refuse to accept the mysterious energy or accept hundreds of cubes of it.

Li Hao said in a low voice,”it’s not for me. It’s for sister Liu. Sister Liu needs this, so the other party compensated her. You don’t understand. This is money to buy your life!”

“You’re making a decision for Liu Yan?”

Wang Ming was surprised. You dare to accept this?

Li Hao grinned.”It’s fine. It’ll be a waste not to take it!”

Sister Liu, do you want it?

Under normal circumstances, she wouldn’t want it, but Li Hao felt that if he said a few more words, sister Liu would want it.

The enemy’s gift, to increase his own strength, and then kill the enemy for revenge ... Why not?

Wang Ming cursed in his heart. Good fellow, this relationship ... Was really not ordinary.

Li Hao looked honest, but he was actually a guy with a lot of passion.

Of course, he had to do a good job when he was getting benefits from others.

The group of people quickly drove to the mine outside the city. Li Hao didn’t even go in. He just took a look at the entrance, then quickly got into the car and left with a smile. It was as if he couldn’t wait to go back immediately, because he had the mysterious energy with him and hadn’t let it go on the way.

After Li Hao and the other man left, Qiao Peng suddenly spat!

“Short-sighted mouse!”

He scolded Li Hao for being so righteous.

In the end, he had accepted the reward and promised to check the mine, but this guy was afraid of dirtying his shoes, so he simply took a look outside and ran away without stopping.

“The night patrol made this guy the Deputy Minister ... They must be blind!”

He cursed again, but after thinking about it, he felt that it was a good thing. At least it saved him a lot of effort.

……

At the same time.

In the car.

Li Hao’s smile gradually disappeared. He glanced at Wang Ming for a long time before saying,”Old Wang, is riyao really an expert?”

“Nonsense!”

Wang Ming was speechless,”do you know how many Nightwatchers there are in the entire Silver Moon province?” One sun glory is the master warrior, and he can fight against a thousand people. Who isn’t a strong master?”

Li Hao silently nodded.

He cursed in his heart. Really?

艹!

In the depths of the mine, I saw three balls of light, three solar flares!

Including Qiao Feilong, it might be one three suns, three sun glory!

Are you kidding me? you’re telling me that riyao is a top-tier powerhouse and can’t be seen?

‘I’ve only been in contact with them for a few days, and I’ve already seen a few three suns. Hao lianchuan, Broken Sky, and the possible Qiao Feilong, as well as the ones who were killed last time, riyao and Huang Yun. And now, there are actually three of them in the dark!’

“The Qiao family!”

He was also shocked. The Qiao family was just a tool for the Yama to make money?

Don’t mess around!

If the Yama was so powerful, Li Hao felt that Red Moon and night patrolman couldn’t compare to him at all. Who would place so many powerhouses in a secular money-making organization?

“It must be something from the eight great families that helped them advance ... It must be, one hundred percent!”

At this moment, Li Hao was certain that the Qiao family was not simple. They must have discovered something and possibly pocketed some benefits.

Otherwise, the Qiao family would not be so powerful.

A small group in a small city on the border of Blizzard Silver City could produce so many experts. Wasn’t that looking down on the night patrollers?

If Wang Ming said that riyao was an expert, then he was definitely one.

However, Li Hao’s heart ached at the benefits that the Qiao family had obtained. They couldn’t have dug up all the remains, right?

Liu Yan’s husband had been dead for a few years. The other party had discovered the remains a few years ago. Perhaps, they had managed to obtain a lot of good stuff in the past few years.

“The Qiao family has been holding back, and the Yama hasn’t made any moves. I haven’t heard of any movements in the Silver City ... Are the Qiao family and the Yama in cahoots? Or is it that the Qiao family did it behind the Yama’s back?”

At this moment, he had some doubts in his heart.

Otherwise, Qiao Feilong might not be the only one on Yama’s side. There might be other three suns that would come and lay in wait to reap the benefits.

At the very least, there had to be checks and balances!

“Let’s go find the teacher!”

Li Hao was both scared and excited.

Perhaps, he could make a fortune this time ... Provided that he didn’t die.

On the side, Wang Ming looked at him strangely.

This guy’s face kept changing. Was he a chameleon?

Why are you so excited after receiving the mysterious energy?

Did he give a lot?

At this moment, he was a little tempted, but he quickly dismissed the idea. I’m not Li Hao. This guy is so short-sighted that he actually took advantage of me. I’ll report him sooner or later!

Of course, if he were to share a little ... Bah, I, Wang Ming, would rather die than share the spoils with him!

All sorts of thoughts popped up in his mind, and Wang Ming sped up a lot.

Silver City ancient Academy.

Li Hao had just left, but he did not go to see Yuan Shuo. Instead, he went to the Dean’s building.

At this moment, he was heading straight for Yuan Shuo’s courtyard.

Wang Ming didn’t come, and that guy said he didn’t want to run anymore, so he waited outside in his car. Li Hao didn’t pay him any attention.

……

In the small courtyard.

Yuan Shuo was sparring with a dog. Recently, Yuan Shuo’s interest had been piqued, and he had been happily training the Black Panther every day. Li Hao didn’t know what was wrong with his teacher, but he had been fighting with the Black Panther for almost half a month.

“Teacher!”

Li Hao had just called out when the Black Panther howled and rushed out, its front legs immediately grabbing onto Li Hao’s thigh.

“Aowu! Woof woof! Meowmeowmeowmeow!”

Li Hao was stunned. What the hell was he shouting about?

“Heibao, why are you meowing like a cat?”

“Awoo, awoo ...”

The Black Panther was extremely anxious. It didn’t want to either. That scary old man kept saying that it might not be a dog, but a hybrid. It might be able to climb trees like cats, bite like wolves, or plow the fields like cows ...

All in all, Heibao felt like he was in deep water and suffering recently!

It was too tragic.

Now that it had finally seen Li Hao, it was anxious. It wanted to run away with Li Hao and never stay with that old man again.

“You’re here?”

Yuan Shuo looked much younger now. He did not care about Heibao and wiped his hands casually.”Don’t run around for no reason. Practice martial arts when you have time. You came here with little Wang, right?”

“Yes, I was busy, so I didn’t come to disturb you, teacher.”

“I’m fine. ”

Yuan Shuo didn’t care too much, and didn’t ask why Wang Ming hadn’t come yet. It was very normal; that guy would definitely be too embarrassed to come.

“This dog is not bad!”

Yuan Shuo chuckled and looked at Heibao, who was so scared that it wanted to tremble.

“Teacher, you hit it?” Li Hao asked helplessly.

“Hit it?”

Yuan Shuo laughed,”of course not!” I’m a teacher, and I rarely use physical punishment on people or dogs. Tell me, have I ever punished you?”

“No, I didn ‘t,”

Li Hao replied, but his tone was a little strange. He didn’t fight ... What was black Panther afraid of?

Woof! Woof! Woof!

The Black Panther immediately cried out for a while. Yuan Shuo chuckled,””This dog is complaining? I didn’t hit it, really. I only stimulated it with a knife and a few more times with the mysterious energy ... This dog’s physical fitness is really good!”

At this moment, Li Hao understood.

He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

This was worse than a beating!

Li Hao was well aware of the stimulation of the saber energy and the mysterious energy. Without the sword to neutralize it, that feeling ... Was really sour and cool.

If there was a sword to neutralize it, it would be very satisfying. But if there was no sword ... He could imagine how miserable Black Panther would be.

Of course, there was happiness in the pain.

Li Hao patted the Black Panther’s head.”I’m giving you something good. Don’t forget to cherish it. You should know that these treasures are hard to find outside!” You’re da gouzi who’s about to become a spirit, you should know how precious these things are. Didn’t so many people die for these things last time?”

The Black Panther’s eyes were filled with tears.

But ... What you don’t know is that this pervert specifically used this energy to stimulate it in turns, saying that he wanted to test its limits. These few days, he was living a life worse than death!

Li Hao didn’t pay any more attention to Black Panther. What a good opportunity.

The teachers wouldn’t even bother with ordinary people.

This dog didn’t know how lucky he was.

He was too lazy to care about the Black Panther’s cry for help and kicked it away. The dog’s claws were quite sharp, and there was a bit of piercing pain.

“Teacher, I have something to do.”

“You wouldn’t have wanted to come if there was nothing.”

Yuan Shuo knew Li Hao too well, so he didn’t bother to say anything. He minded his own business, and Li Hao could only follow him.

Yuan Shuo, however, was unwilling to hear him out first. He spoke first,””We’re going to the ruins at the end of August!”

“I’m going too?”

Li Hao asked.

Yuan Shuo considered for a while and said with uncertainty,””I don’t know, and I can’t decide! The ancient ruins are both a crisis and an opportunity, and the ancient ruins I discovered might have some connection to the eight great families ... Not necessarily!”

It was related to the eight great families again!

Li Hao slightly frowned,”teacher, the eight great families” roots are in Silver City. Does that mean that Silver City has the remains of the eight great families?” Teacher is also an expert in this field. Could it be that you haven’t discovered any remains in Silver City all these years?”

“The Silver City ...”

Yuan Shuo poured himself a cup of tea and walked out with the teacup in his hand,””I’ve seen Silver City. The Feng Shui is average, and it doesn’t look like there’s a big tomb. Of course, the ruins might not be a tomb. It could be that the ancient city sank and was covered in dust, but ... These things are rarely unearthed in Silver City. I have investigated before, but I have not found any traces of the ruins. ”

He was everyone!

Li Hao frowned. Even his teacher didn’t notice anything?

“Teacher, Silver City might really have it!”

“What?”

Yuan Shuo frowned slightly and thought for a moment before saying,””If there is ... It’s actually normal! After all, the legend of the eight great families originated from Silver City. I’ve been speculating over the past few days, and if there really is one, it should be in the eight trigrams!”

“Moreover, it’s not an ordinary ruin. It might also be in a sealed state, and people can die easily!”

“You noticed?” he looked at Li Hao.

“Teacher, wait ...”

As Li Hao spoke, he entered the room and took out a piece of paper and a pen. He picked up the pen and quickly drew the outline of the Silver City on the paper.

It was similar to gossip!

In the past, he didn’t pay much attention to it. There were many cities with such a layout, and the eight trigrams wasn’t very special, so it was fine to see it as a circle.


Chapter 233: The master and disciple set up a new plan (2)
Translator: 549690339
However, ever since Li Hao saw the Bagua diagram in the sky ... He couldn’t see it now. Only when the red shadow entered his body and his blood boiled did Li Hao see it once. Perhaps he would need the blue Rain to see it.

Because the next few times, when he absorbed the power of the red shadow, he did not see that gossip.

But Li Hao remembered all this.

At this moment, he quickly drew a pattern.

It was a map of the silver Blizzard city, and it was also a Bagua Map. He quickly pointed a red dot in one of the areas.

Yuan Shuo took a look and raised his eyebrows slightly.”North, li position in the eight trigrams. Li is fire, located in the northern suburbs of Silver City. This place ... Should be a mine. It seems to be owned by the Qiao’s mining company.”

Li position!

Li was fire. At this moment, Li Hao suddenly thought of the mysterious energy that Qiao Feilong had given him. It was of the fire element!

Perhaps it was just a coincidence, but Li Hao still subconsciously thought of this.

“There’s a historical site here?”

Yuan Shuo looked at Li Hao in surprise.

He didn’t wait for Li Hao to speak, and quickly said,””I’ve been to this place, but I didn’t find anything, nor any clues to the remains. When I went there, it was because this place had collapsed once, so Mrs. Qiao invited me, hoping that I could reopen a mine ...”

He was a professor in the Department of ancient civilization, Feng Shui, and grave robbing ... Ahem, exploration.

It was normal to find him after reopening the mine.

Li Hao said in a deep voice, right here! I don’t know the details, but I’m not making a wild guess. Teacher, do you know the background of our Silver city’s Qiao’s mining company?”

“Mrs. Qiao ... Qiao Feilong ...”

Yuan Shuo thought for a moment and recalled,””Qiao Feilong was originally a native of Silver City. When he was young, he left home to develop in another place. He only returned to Silver City when he was almost 40 years old. By then, he already had a family business.”

“After that, the Qiao’s mining company was established in Silver City for almost 30 years.”

Not 20 years ago, but 30 years ago, he had returned to Silver City to start his business.

Therefore, under normal circumstances, even if the information about the eight great families was leaked, people would be able to associate it with the layout of the Crimson Moon more than ten years ago, but it would be difficult to imagine that the Qiao mining industry, which had existed for thirty years, was also related to the eight great families.

At this moment, Li Hao was also wondering if this guy had only contacted the Yama later, or if the Yama had really started planning thirty years ago.

The superpowers had not even risen!

Yuan Shuo continued,”Qiao Feilong also practiced martial arts, but his achievements weren’t high. After he reached the tenth realm, he stopped practicing martial arts. The tenth realm was only for self-protection.” Later, when the Qiao’s mining industry expanded, he had the money to hire those martial masters as bodyguards, so naturally, he no longer studied these things. ”

“But this guy is also a ruthless person behind the scenes. For his business to be able to reach its current state, he has done a lot of other things in private. It is easy to have conflicts in the mining industry. There were a lot of black mines in Silver City back then, but they were all destroyed by him!”

Yuan Shuo pointed at the spot Li Hao had drawn earlier.””This place used to have many black mines. Later, Qiao Feilong’s Qiao’s mining company took over, and not long after, those black mine owners were either dead or crippled ... Some of them took the initiative to sell their mines at a low price. The silver Blizzard city didn’t do anything either, mainly because these black mine bosses aren’t good people. They’re dogs biting each other, and their mouths are full of fur!”

After a brief introduction, he said,””Of course. On the surface, Qiao Feilong is a big entrepreneur and philanthropist. He has donated a lot to Blizzard Silver City, including the ancient academy. There’s also the Feilong laboratory building in the ancient academy, which he donated.”

Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded. He had been there before.

He had forgotten that it was Qiao Feilong who had donated it.

Yuan Shuo looked at Li Hao, waiting for his message. The sudden mention of the Qiao’s clearly had something to do with the Qiao ‘s. Could it be that a relic had been found in the Qiao’s mine?

Li Hao revealed a smile.”Teacher, you’ve dealt with Qiao Feilong before. Do you think he’s a super?”

“Yes!”

“Supers,” Yuan Shuo replied calmly.

Li Hao was stunned.

“You know?”

“I don’t know,”

Yuan Shuo was calm and composed. The next moment, he sneered,””You’ve already said so, and I still said no. Am I stupid or are you stupid?”

When his student asked this, he immediately understood.

Li Hao was speechless.

Yuan Shuo frowned,”he’s a superhuman?” To be honest, I met him not long ago. If he is a superhuman ... He is either weak to the point where I can’t sense him, or strong to the point where I can’t sense him!”

There were only two possibilities!

He then added,”to be able to hide it from me, you even came here to tell me ... Could it be that this guy is an extremely powerful super?” Sunlight? Three yang?”

As for Yue Ming ... How could she be considered an expert?

“It’s related to the ancient ruins,”Yuan Shuo muttered to himself,” could it be that after obtaining the ancient ruins of the eight great families, there are ancient ruins under the mine?” So, after obtaining some benefits, he silently became an expert and has been hiding. What is he plotting?”

“There really is a relic in the Silver City ... I didn’t find it. It’s a pity. If I had found it, I would have entered the thousand warrior class A long time ago.”

Yuan Shuo sighed with emotion and ignored Li Hao’s desire to speak.

“Three yang?”

He mumbled,”if Qiao Feilong is a three-yang existence, he can’t lead the ruins ‘exploration by himself. He must have someone to help him. Could it be that he also has sunlight under him?”

He touched his beardless chin and said,””One person. He’s probably worried that the other party will run away with the money. At least two?”


Chapter 234: The master and disciple set up a new plan (3)
Translator: 549690339
Only two could balance each other!

For someone like Qiao Feilong, trust was limited. It was impossible for him to trust a single person indefinitely. Furthermore, the other party was a big entrepreneur who had enough resources and money to train and accumulate a few supers.

“Silver City is a small place, but it’s not peaceful!”

“Little Hao, if you don’t care about the eight great families” ancestral graves or ancestral lands, then I think it’s better not to provoke them. They’re not easy to provoke!”Yuan Shuo sighed again.

Li Hao was speechless. I didn’t even say anything.

Obviously, his teacher had determined that the other party had more than one expert.

The older the ginger, the spicier it was!

“Teacher, one of them might be Qiao Feilong from the three suns. The other three must be in the sunlit realm, and the last one is Yue Ying ...”

“Hiss!”

Yuan Shuo took a deep breath.”He’s really not to be trifled with. Little Hao, your teacher’s old bones won’t be able to withstand this kind of torment!”

“You want to take back the remains?” he asked Li Hao.

“No, I was just thinking ...” Li Hao said in embarrassment.

“That’s normal, after all, you’re the only successor of the eight great families, so the ruins of the eight great families should be yours, and What’s Yours Is Mine. So, Qiao Feilong is taking advantage of us, right?”

Li Hao hurriedly nodded.

Yuan Shuo continued,”also, the eight great families” ruins may need your weapons or bloodlines to open, even if he can open it, it’ll only be a small opening, it’s impossible to completely open it!” So, he must have his eyes on you, so ... We’ve become enemies?”

Li Hao nodded again. His teacher was right!

Yuan Shuo raised his brows,”the one who strikes first gains the upper hand, and the one who strikes later suffers!” If you don’t want to do it, then do it in one go!”

“The other party might be a chess piece of Yama ...”

Before Li Hao could finish his sentence, Yuan Shuo said disapprovingly,””It’s fine, he’s definitely hiding it from the Yama! I know Qiao Feilong all too well. With such a benefit, if he tells Yama, it’ll be none of his business. It’d be a wonder if he would tell!”

“As long as we eliminate the root of the problem and get rid of Qiao Feilong, all the supers under him, his son, and all the helpers who helped him explore the remains ... Even if Yama has some guesses, he won’t be able to guess that the remains have really been discovered.”

Li Hao opened his mouth.

He was only suspicious, but his teacher was certain.

It was as if he understood Qiao Feilong very well!

Yuan Shuo suddenly laughed,”stop looking, it’s normal!” I, your teacher, am actually such a person as well. I was forced by the situation. Otherwise, do you think I’m willing to be a thug for the night patrollers, a tool, and help them explore the remains? I had no choice, otherwise, I would have taken it all for myself!”

He, Yuan Shuo, was really not a good person.

It was just Li Hao’s opinion.

If he, Yuan Shuo, were in Qiao Feilong’s shoes, he would do the same. This was a result of the older generation martial masters ‘personalities. They were arrogant, selfish, and greedy-Yuan Shuo actually had all of them.

However, after many years of self-cultivation and knowing that he was going to die, he was disheartened and accepted Li Hao as a kind teacher.

The truth was that he, Yuan Shuo, was demon Yuan.

They were the same kind of people, so how could he not understand Qiao Feilong?

Furthermore, the moment he opened his mouth, he wanted to kill them all!

Not only that, Yuan Shuo’s eyes narrowed.”Not only do we have to silence him, but we can’t make too much of a commotion. We can’t let too many people know that Qiao Feilong is an expert! It wasn’t a problem for Qiao Feilong to be a Dark Moon, but he definitely couldn’t be the three dazzling Suns! Otherwise, why would Qiao Feilong stay in the Silver City for so many years?”

“Yueming, that’s no problem. Yama is a money-making tool and he has money. What’s so great about becoming Yueming? The only thing you can’t do is the three suns, understand?”

Li Hao wasn’t used to his teacher’s fast pace.””Teacher, you mean ... We’re going to kill him directly?”

Yes, that was what Yuan Shuo meant.

Without any hesitation!

After Li Hao finished speaking, he began to think about how to silence them.

This efficiency, this decisiveness, this viciousness ... As expected of old demon Yuan!

Yuan Shuo snorted coldly,”indecisiveness leads to chaos!” Since he knew that they were enemies, of course he had to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots! I, your teacher, was too soft-hearted back then and didn’t kill Ying Hongyue directly to let him escape. As a result, he’s been hiding here and there for 20 years. Don’t learn from me!”

If he didn’t do it, he would do it, then he would do it to the end!

He looked in one direction, in the direction of the Qiao’s mining headquarters.

Yuan Shuo was silent for a moment before he said,”even if I use my killing move again and kill Qiao Feilong, three sunlit powerhouses ... They won’t be easy to deal with!” I can’t fight all of them by myself, and I have to be fast. Are those three in the mine?”

“Right!”

“Then we have to split up!”

“I’ll deal with Qiao Feilong, but I’ll need to find someone to deal with the three from riyao. Other than food, we’ll also need to deal with the other superpowers and his son!”Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice. This isn’t something that one or two people can accomplish. If we don’t move, if we move, we have to do it together and end the battle quickly, not letting a single person escape. ”

“Silver City seems calm and peaceful, but I don’t know how many eyes are watching us in secret.”

He then added,”it’s best not to reveal anything. Otherwise, once Qiao Feilong dies, some people might suspect the mine ... Or they can find a reason to say that they are related to the Crimson Moon. With this as an excuse, they can be killed!” Then, use the night patrol to seal up the entire Qiao’s mining industry!”

Li Hao scratched his head and said,””Is there any hope for us to deal with one sunlight if we all attack together?”


Chapter 235: The master and disciple set up a new plan (4)
Translator: 549690339
“Almost!”

That was it.

That’s right, if Liu Long’s team, together with Wang Ming’s group, worked together, they might only be able to deal with a single sunlight, which showed just how strong they were.

However, there were three sunlit realm cultivators!

Not to mention, there were other superpowers and martial masters in the Qiao’s mining industry. Even in the mine, there were mine guards recruited by them. Although most of them were ordinary people, they were all cruel and ruthless people who carried some firearms.

This was also permitted. The Qiao’s mining company had a gun license and also had a security company under it.

This time, Li Hao’s head ached.”Then let’s pretend we don’t know. We can’t do anything to them in the short term!” On the contrary, it’s easy for mistakes to happen. Let them run away, it’s good if they make a big deal out of it, or annihilate them all and make a big deal out of it, or even be annihilated by them ... I don’t want to see any of those. ”

Li Hao was more willing to deal with his opponent quietly and get some benefits, rather than making a scene.

If everyone really knew about it, so what if he had many treasures?

He wasn’t interested in being chased all over the world!

In the central region, people above the three suns were fighting over a treasure. Li Hao didn’t want to be the next target.

“I can’t wait!”

“You can wait, but they won ‘t!” Yuan Shuo said with a straight face. Qiao Feilong isn’t stupid. He also knows that with the death of the three suns of the Crimson Moon, the Silver City has become a target of attention. The reason why no experts have come is because the central region is holding them back!”

“However, once the war in the central region has eased up a little, experts will quickly rush over, so Qiao Feilong is also fighting for time. He’s definitely waiting for an opportunity to completely open the ruins, or to kill you and seize your sword or bloodline ...”

“He doesn’t know that I still have my sword.”

“Then I need your blood!”

“Do you think he only wants the sword?” Yuan Shuo said disapprovingly. His goal might not be the same as Crimson Moon ‘s. Crimson moon’s goal might be related to the gossip in the sky, but Qiao Feilong cares more about the present. Therefore, he hopes that your blood can open the ruins. ”

Li Hao nodded.

This was true.

Qiao Feilong didn’t necessarily care about the gossip map. Even if he knew, he might not care. Moreover, he was being targeted by the red moon, so he probably wanted to get a big haul and leave.

“So, even if I’m willing to wait, he won ‘t?” Li Hao said helplessly.

“I met him today,” she said.”He’s very warm and polite. It seems like ... He’s going to send me off soon?”

“More or less.”

Yuan Shuo laughed as well,”you’re not bad. You didn’t give yourself away, did you?” You’ve already sensed his strength, yet you’re not scared to the point of peeing?”

“How could I!”

Li Hao also laughed,”how can I embarrass my teacher?” Who does Qiao Feilong think he is? my teacher even killed three suns. Even if he’s a three suns, my teacher can kill him!”

It wasn’t to the extent of peeing, but he was really scared.

“Enough, don’t say these polite words. It’s boring.”

Yuan Shuo frowned and said,”we’d better think about how to solve this problem.” It’s really not easy to kill them all while making little movements. ”

“Where’s the night patrolman?”Li Hao asked in a low voice.

“Don’t be ridiculous!”

Yuan Shuo shook his head,”unless the night patrolman’s three suns are here!” Only one or two of them, Hao lianchuan or hou Xiaochen, can do it without a trace. But hou Xiaochen won’t leave white moon City. As for Hao lianchuan ...”

At this point, Yuan Shuo frowned and said,”don’t trust them too much. Who knows if they have other intentions? I don’t know much about Hao lianchuan. Although I know him, it’s easy for us to have disagreements when it comes to confidential matters. He also has a big backer behind him-the night watchman!”

In fact, it was not easy to cooperate with such a powerful backer.

If Hao lianchuan really fell out with them, Yuan Shuo and his disciple could not afford to offend the night patrol.

“AI!”

“AI!”

The master and disciple sighed at the same time.

Yuan Shuo looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao looked back at Yuan Shuo. The master and disciple both looked worried.

It’s not easy!

“Teacher, you’ve been running amuck in the martial arts world for so many years, don’t you have any good friends?”

Li Hao’s resentful expression made Yuan Shuo’s eyebrows Twitch.

“Master, if the 100-plus martial masters in your era were to advance to super at the beginning, they would at least be at the sun glory realm. After so many years, they might even reach the three suns realm. Are your old friends all dead?”

“No, isn’t Ying Hongyue still alive?”

Yuan Shuo’s words made Li Hao feel embarrassed.”Forget I said anything.”

Ying Hongyue!

Perhaps he had surpassed three suns ... There was a high probability that he had surpassed them. They were the leaders of one of the three major organizations. Teacher really could make friends.

“I naturally have a few old friends ...”

Yuan Shuo laughed and quickly shook his head. “It’s precisely because we’re old friends that I don’t want to use things like interests to test and measure. It’s normal for brothers to break up because of an uneven distribution of spoils, let alone friends. To put it bluntly, old friends, it’s still okay to go through thick and thin together, but it’s too rare to see people sharing wealth and prosperity together!”

He had friends, and some of them were not weak.

However, he didn’t want to use this to test the waters.

If it was just an ordinary ruin, there would be no problem.

But this time, the eight great families and Li Hao were involved, and the key was that they might even have to kill Li Hao to open the remains ... It would be difficult to find those people.

What if Li Hao’s blood was required when the remains opened?

If he killed Li Hao, Yuan Shuo could hold back, but what about his old friend?
