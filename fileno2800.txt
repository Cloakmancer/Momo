"Of course, once the Outlander domain is restored, you can go and try to comprehend the Dao you need. It doesn't matter if it's restoration, destruction, life, or death ... It's up to you!""In addition, did Silvermoon give birth to her own great Dao? If it is born ... There seems to be some special great Dao power here that doesn't come from tianfang. It might be the power of a foreign great Dao. That means that the Silvermoon world is near tianfang, and the Silvermoon world is very large. It is impossible for the Silver Moon King to take the world and escape!""I can't escape with the world ... The Son of God entered the tianfang great Dao universe and comprehended Nirvana. This person opened the tianfang universe ... Could the Silvermoon world be hidden in the tianfang universe?"Wushan made some deductions.If the Silver Moon King had brought a great Dao universe ... That great Dao universe couldn't be easily moved, and it would have definitely come with the Silver Moon world. However, now that he had escaped, it was impossible for him to escape with the world.Thus...The Silvermoon world was still close to Tian Fang!Where was he?He could only do it in the tianfang great Dao universe!If this was the case, it meant that Li Hao could really open tianfang universe. In this case, his smile became even more brilliant. "He's so bold to hide Silver Moon in front of everyone, but I have to say, he's very safe! Other than him, no one else can open it. This place is safer than any other place. " Kong Ji felt helpless.This person was more difficult to deal with than expected."I can't make a decision on this matter!"Wu Shan nodded."I understand. In fact, the Silver Moon King is definitely running toward Heaven's Fate. If I wanted to, I would have been able to catch him. Why don't I go and catch him?"Kong Ji thought for a while."Senior, you can't leave. If you leave, everyone will think that this great path universe isn't real. Otherwise, why would you give up the opportunity to study the great path universe as a seventh level venerable sovereign?""Right!"Wu Shan nodded."It's good that you understand. I'm not leaving or chasing him because I want his plan to succeed. I want the Crimson Moon experts to give up on tracking those small fries from the celestial pole and give him a chance. Otherwise, his chances will be slim!""Say, I've already done this much ... Shouldn't this Silver Moon King return the favor?"Kong Ji nodded,"that's right!" However, I've already said that we're just friends. I'm not him, so I can only convey my opinions and can't make decisions for him. ""That's what I should do. ""Tianfang region has light and Yunxiao. The two powers can't be balanced. If there was Wushan Jie, then it would be balanced!" Of course, I'll also promise that I won't work with Yunxiao to destroy the light ... If the godchild doesn't believe me, he can take the opportunity to reach rank 7. I'll reach rank 8, but there's a high chance that I won't reach rank 9 ... With the godchild's achievements, he doesn't have to fear me!"Kong Jue pondered and did not say anything."Son of God, you can try to communicate with the other party now," Wu Shan added."I don't have a way to contact him.""Are you joking, Divine Child?" Wu Shan chuckled."I didn 't!"Kong Ji shook his head. He was uncontactable to begin with.Wu Shan furrowed his brows,"in that case, I can only go after him now!" Although the primordial chaos is vast, his speed is definitely much slower than mine. Do you think I can catch up to him, Divine Child?""It's not like there's no way!"Kong Ji said after a moment of silence.Wu Shan nodded."Then, Divine Son, please convey my suggestion. Silvermoon has a great Dao universe. He doesn't need to fight with me. As for Divine Son ..." He looked at Kong Ji and smiled."A level-nine great Dao universe is strong, but it's only destroyed. The Divine Child isn't even willing to inherit a level-eight great Dao universe. He must have his own thoughts and even wants to open his own great Dao universe. Only those that suit him are the strongest!""We're old and don't have so many ambitions. We just want to retire in peace, be our own Kings, live more freely, and don't want to sell our lives for others. Therefore, when the opportunity is right, even if it's a foreign universe of the great path, we'll like it very much!"Wu Shan seemed to be very sincere ... But Kong Ji didn't take it seriously.It would be strange if this old man didn't have ambition.It was because he was ambitious that he would do this.How unambitious ... He immediately made a judgment and went after Li Hao.Li Hao, Li Hao!I told you to stop, but you insisted ... Of course, even if Li Hao stopped doing all this, once Wu Shan arrived, he could still guess a little. After all, this guy was very meticulous.The traces left by Li Hao couldn't be hidden from him even if they were removed.He had even managed to guess where Silver Moon was hiding."Then I'll think of a way ... To let him communicate directly with senior?""Sure. If the Divine Child has a way, that would be the best!"Wu Shan laughed. This time, he laughed in an extremely happy manner.It was a good thing!I like to chat with these young people.Old people were too boring.Young people were so interesting. They dared to do things that others didn't dare to do. Even if there were many mistakes, at least they dared to do it. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Many people didn't dare to do so when they were old.……In the chaos.Li Hao was still walking when his River suddenly fluctuated slightly. The mark of the Dao chess game fluctuated for a moment, and the next moment, he heard an empty voice instead of a shadow 's!"I've been exposed!"Li Hao was stunned. So fast?He frowned slightly.It was too fast. There was news at the first moment. Now, there was no need to think to know who had discovered it.Wushan!The expert from the cloud world."He wants to talk to you ... I have a part of the content of our conversation. Take a look at it yourself. These old ghosts are very smart! You and I have underestimated the heroes of the world, but this might not be a bad opportunity. "

2801 Chapter 462
At this point, Kong Ji sent over a video without saying anything else.After a while, the transmission ended, and he said,""After you've finished reading it, you can communicate with it through the brand ... You just need to consume some energy. Not only can you comprehend the Dao in Dao chess, but those with the brand can also communicate with each other."Li Hao nodded and didn't say much.He watched the video of their conversation from the beginning to the end.After a long time, he let out a long breath.In the eyes of a seventh rank venerable sovereign, there were so many mistakes?From the looks of it, the seventh step that he had borrowed power from was not the real seventh step after all, and his judgment of the seventh step was still very different.Or rather, this Wushan wasn't an Ordinary Grade 7.The experts of the cloud world ...After thinking for a while, he used up a lot of energy. He wasn't too far from Tian Fang, so he quickly contacted Kong Ji."Let me talk to senior Wushan!""Alright!"……After a while.A shadow appeared in the river.As for Li Hao, he looked at the shadow and sighed. He didn't say much and said,""Senior, are you saying that I should open the tianfang great cosmos and you can take over?""Yes,""Of course, you can also refuse!" Wu Shan smiled. "At this moment, you might be able to escape. For you, even if you give up some people, it doesn't matter. Neo martial might have its own arrangements, so you don't need to worry. But if you agree, I can provide you with some help!""That includes ... Directly attacking the venerable sovereigns from the red moon! They were forced to send more experts to help! You have to understand that it's very dangerous to attack a high-level venerable sovereign, and you'll have to pay a great price ...""If I agree now," Li Hao said,"what if I regret it after the crisis is over?""Don't you want Silver Moon?" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Wu Shan laughed."What if I wait until I'm at the seventh rank before going back?""Of course." Wu Shan laughed again."You may be a genius with top talent, but if you don't return to Tian Fang ... It'll be very difficult for you to become a rank seven while wandering outside! There were many opportunities in the world, but they were often not your opportunities! I feel that many of your opportunities are in tianfang! You'll be back. Besides, I'm only talking to you. If you don't agree, I can't force you, can I?""Tianfang is a tier 9 great universe that hasn't recovered yet. Even if senior enters, you might not be able to control the recovery ...""It doesn't matter!""What I want may not be Tian Fang!" Wu Shan laughed. Li Hao fell into deep thought. What did he mean?"People like us hope to get rid of some restrictions," Wu Shan explained. "In fact, it's best if Tian Fang doesn't recover! "I just need to move my great Dao here so that it can have a place to hold it and won't dissipate! Whether or not he could control it was not necessarily the key! More importantly, you won't be restricted by anyone!""No high-level venerable sovereigns want to be a chess piece for others. I'm no exception.""What do you think, Silver Moon King?""Do I have the right to refuse?" Li Hao asked after some thought."There is!",m Wu Shan laughed."As long as you don't care about anything and just run away, you can still borrow some external power. Maybe you can borrow the power of the seventh step again and escape out of tianfang or the Crimson Moon. Do you think I can really chase after you?""Silver Moon King, isn't it all up to you to refuse?"Li Hao considered for a moment before saying,"I can't guarantee that I'll hand Tian Fang over to you ... That's not mine!" I can only say that I can open the tianfang universe for you once. You can enter it, but it's up to you whether you can occupy it! If senior is trapped inside, it has nothing to do with me, and I won't keep it open ... And I can't do it! If senior agrees, then it's fine!"This time, it was Wu Shan's turn to consider.It would only open for him to enter, but it wouldn't be open forever. Whether he could occupy it or not ... Was entirely up to him.Wu Shan fell into deep thought.He had helped Li Hao cover up once, in exchange for Li Hao opening a level-nine great Dao universe for him.Was it worth it?Of course it was worth it!He didn't need to pay too much. As for fighting Red Moon sovereign and advanced venerable sovereigns, it wasn't like he had to fight to the death. He just had nothing to do.After a long time, Wu Shan replied,"sure, it all depends on your own ability!" It's your luck to be able to occupy it. If you can 't, then you can't be blamed! "I've received news that two rank seven venerable sovereigns might come from the Crimson Moon ... But they might not be able to draw the attention of all the Crimson Moon powerhouses. If the divine light realm sends someone, I can play with them. Perhaps I can attract the attention of one or two more high-rank venerable sovereigns! It's up to you whether you can get in touch with new martial. Just as you said, if you give me an opportunity, I'll give you one ... If there's any news, I'll let the Son of God pass it on to you!"Li Hao took a deep breath."Alright!""Happy cooperation!"Wu Shan laughed heartily."That's right. The Divine Child has committed to memory the matter of killing Chi Yun and the others. Otherwise ... I won't be able to explain it to you! In addition, don't try to deal with Huilong and the others. If you expose your whereabouts, I won't be able to explain it to you!""Alright!"Li Hao agreed without hesitation.This time, he had underestimated a seventh rank venerable sovereign. Naturally, he would have to pay the price. It was already less than he had expected. The other party had agreed that he only needed to open it once.This was considered a light punishment.If the tianfang great Dao universe had really been occupied by the other party, it would be Wu Shan's strength and luck.Li Hao took a deep breath and cut off the connection.

2802 Chapter 462
At this moment, he looked at the depth of the chaos and Tian Fang in the distance. After a long time, he turned to Qian Wuliang and said,""The chaos is quite interesting. There are all kinds of people in the universe who always think that they can do the best, only to find out that they are all jokes in the face of absolute strength!"Li Hao laughed at himself. The next moment, he bared his teeth. "I'm going into seclusion!“"What?""I want to enter the 4th tier!"Li Hao's conviction was strengthened!Previously, he had some thoughts. After waiting for a while, he might be able to contact New martial artists and try to get the understanding of the ultimate Yin way. Now ... With the appearance of Wu Shan, Li Hao completely gave up on these thoughts.Li Hao, you're not the smartest or the strongest here. At this time, not everything will go according to your plan.You can only become stronger!Therefore, he chose to give up. Instead of waiting for the Dao of Yin Yang, he tried to comprehend the Dao of destruction and recovery. If it didn't work, he could try the Dao of light and darkness. If it really didn't work, he could try the Dao of the five elements!In any case, I want to advance!The Tier 6 chi Yun's corpse was just enough for him to use.After the fourth step, he would talk about the rest.Qian Wuliang didn't have any objections. If it were him, he would have already advanced to the fourth step.……At this moment, in the dark Demon Ridge.Wu Shan smiled and looked at the dark Shrine, then at Kong Ji."Many thanks to the Divine Child for helping to pull the strings!"He laughed."The dark Demon Ridge is not simple. The divine realm of light has even compensated for the Son of God's murder. Let's buy the dark Demon Ridge while we're at it!" The godchild killed Chi Yun because Chi Yun expelled the godchild and prevented him from comprehending the rank eight Dao of darkness ... We'll pay a price and settle the matter between Chi Yun and the dark Demon Ridge. What do you think?"He had even found an excuse!Light and darkness fusion!This excuse was perfect.The dark Demon Ridge, the place where the eighth step dark emissaries were located.The divine light realm, the territory of the type 8 radiant sovereign.They were both at the eighth step, the two extremes of light and darkness. Kong Ji discovered the opportunity, Chi Yun tried to stop him, and he was killed by him ... There was nothing wrong with that.Kong Ji was helpless."What's the price?""I don't want too many. I won't be able to get too many anyway ... Three medium-level worlds!"He smiled."Chi Yun is a level six. One for his descendants and one for the great cloud world. I'll take one for myself!" It's the fee for running errands. "As for venerable Dragon Emperor ... He didn't consider that.He can go wherever he wants and find whoever he wants. It has nothing to do with me. If the realm Lord is generous, it's not a problem to give the other one to Hui long. He's running errands anyway, so there's no reason not to take one.Kong Ji could only nod.Wu Shan had clearly seen through something and knew that something existed in the dark Demon Ridge ... He even knew that it was a chess piece!However, this person didn't care about this.What he wanted was still the tianfang great Dao universe.With the tianfang great Dao universe, the Dao chess was just an accessory, and there was no need for that."Alright!"Kong Ji agreed.Wu Shan laughed and turned to leave. "Dao chess," Kong Ji suddenly said."It's made in an eighth-tier great cosmos. Senior ... Why don't you want it?""An eighth-tier great cosmos?"Wu Shan didn't even turn his head."An eighth-tier great cosmos that has been refined. The power of great DAOs inside it has been exhausted. Can it help me reach the eighth-tier?" It can 't! Even the Dao master is only at the eighth rank. Can a half-crippled person make me reach the eighth rank? I'm interested in level six and Ordinary Level Seven, but I'm not. If I want to reach level eight, I need a higher Dao universe!""Also ... Sacred central crypt ... No, empty solitude, remember this. All great path universes are born from the comprehension of cultivators!"He immediately left, not staying any longer.Kong Ji fell into deep thought.All the great path universes were born from the comprehension of cultivators. This was a meaningful statement.Even his father had never mentioned this.After he left, the shadow appeared and suddenly said,""He's right!""Senior, Wushan's meaning is ..."​ "It's very simple. The universe of the great path that was born from the comprehension of a level eight venerable sovereign is half-useless. To him, it's almost impossible to reach level eight. Even if the ninth-tier great path universe that the ninth-tier master of tianfang comprehended is empty, it can still help him enter the eighth-tier, so it's a treasure. On one side, it's a treasure, and on the other side, it's trash. Is trash still a treasure?"“……”I didn't say those words.Wu Shan was also a madman.The chess pieces refined by an eighth-tier universe were just trash.He glanced in the direction that the other party had left. Li Hao wasn't the only one who underestimated these people.Even though I've seen a lot, I didn't expect that Wu Shan would be able to understand everything in an instant, seize the opportunity, and reach an agreement with Li Hao in the blink of an eye. What's the point of killing Li Hao?Entering tianfang universe and becoming an eighth-level venerable sovereign. If everything went smoothly, he would be able to control a ninth-level universe and achieve Wushan realm. This was his true goal.And the other party had the capital."Lord of the clouds ..."He suddenly laughed,'perhaps, Yunxiao will lose a top-notch venerable sovereign. It's no wonder Wushan wants to leave. All the errands are for him. He's already at the seventh rank, and he's still helping Yunxiao run errands. It's normal for him to want to run. "A seventh-rank would be a King anywhere.In Yunxiao, that realm Lord might have trusted him too much or felt that he had extraordinary abilities. Hence, he was always the one running errands for him.This was also the reason why Kong Ji knew that Wushan was most likely the cause of the incident.Obviously, this person was not happy.This was interesting!If it were someone else, they might have chased after Li Hao. Of course, another person might not have noticed anything wrong at all.The mysterious man sighed."The current Hundun is quite interesting. It hasn't been out for many years. It's said that there's a new martial art. It should be quite interesting."Kong Ji didn't say anything and continued to cultivate with his eyes closed. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "It's interesting, but ... I'm still too weak now. It'll be more interesting after I reach the seventh rank.Li Hao, I don't know if you understand this.This time, if you don't enter the intermediate level, I'm afraid it'll be very difficult for you to do anything. Then it'll be meaningless.……Wu Shan, who had walked out of the dark Demon Ridge, looked at the sky and smiled.Young people are interesting, I also hope that this area is more interesting. Sector Lord, I'm not betraying you, it's just that ... I'm at least Level 7, running errands is too tiring, I also hope that in the future, others will run errands for me, I also need to go into closed door training!

2803 Chapter 463
Chaos was interesting.It wasn't just killing.The emptiness and the Misty Mountain were both very interesting.In fact, it wasn't just them. Even Hui long, who Li Hao wanted to kill, was an interesting person. Thinking about it carefully, he was also a businessman who treated cultivation as a business. From the free guides he arranged at the South realm gate and the free cultivation resources that venerable sovereigns bought for him ... All of these showed that Hui long was actually a businessman.Chaos was not the chaotic world that only had slaughter and war as Li Hao remembered.Of course, all of this was interesting because one had to be capable.Kong Ji's father was at the eighth step, so he had the right to talk about being interesting when he was at the fifth step.Wushan's seventh rank venerable sovereign was a capital in itself, and he had the qualifications to do so.A sixth level Hui long venerable sovereign with the clouds behind his back was also qualified ...Only Li Hao lacked the qualifications.Was he at the perfected stage of stage three with a neo martial art behind him? Forget it!If neo martial didn't go to war with Crimson Moon, it would indeed be a big advantage for Li Hao. The key was that neo martial was going to war with a rank-8 world. In this way, neo martial would become a hindrance.Wu Shan's words made Li Hao understand one thing ... The weak were not worthy of scheming against the strong.It wasn't that he couldn't scheme, but that the price he had to pay was too great. There were too many things he had to consider and too much time was needed. He couldn't just bait the enemy with a simple scheme in a short time.If Li Hao was given enough time, he could have made the Dao universe more realistic. If he was not careful, he might have been able to scheme against a high-leveled venerable sovereign.However, where would he find the time?Where would he have that much energy?If he had that much time, he could have advanced in rank.In the chaos, Li Hao avoided the normal route of the Crimson Moon world. He found a deserted, remote place where there were no other worlds nearby. At this moment, he was sitting cross-legged and cultivating.Since the Dao of Yin Yang was not easy to obtain, he would change it.Nirvana recovery, light and darkness, the five elements, all of them could be considered.The key was, which one was more suitable?Who could successfully enter the sixth step after entering the fourth step? p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Just like the process of accumulating energy from rank one to rank three ... However, this process also required some correct paths. For example, he had built the Bridge of Life and death, which was the path of advancement.After entering the fourth step, Li Hao still needed to consider the path to the sixth step.He should choose which one went smoothly.It didn't matter which path was stronger ... In his mind, without the yin and yang, it didn't matter which path he chose.Of course, destruction and revival might be better. Strictly speaking, these two and the Dao of life and death were related.Nirvana, death.Recovery, creation.Perhaps, they were all from the same lineage.Moreover, these two DAOs had also been verified by Kong Ji. Putting everything else aside, Kong Ji had only gained a small understanding of the Dao of recovery, but the Dao of recovery had directly restored Li Hao's energy ... This was terrifying.The feeling of a Super Nanny!If Li Hao learned it, he could heal himself.There was also the Dao of Nirvana, which was a super control-type Dao art that could silence people and cover up the chaos lightning tribulation. If the chaos lightning tribulation wasn't too strong, a Nirvana world thrown down in a normal battle between venerable sovereigns wouldn't even be sensed by those standing nearby.This was the terrifying aspect of this Dao."It's just the Dao of resurrection. Even Voidwalker himself isn't very clear on how to comprehend it ... It'll be even more difficult for me. "In fact, Li Hao had seen a lot. He had seen the rise of neo martial arts, seen some advanced tactics, and talked with Kong Ji, the son of a rank eight venerable sovereign ...He had come into contact with many high-level venerable sovereigns through various means.In terms of knowledge, some rank six venerable sovereigns were not as good as him.However, sometimes, enlightenment also depended on luck, experience, and time. He had lived too short, so he had only seen many things but had never really experienced them.Kong Ji had lived for a thousand years, but how many years did Li Hao have?He might not have comprehended the Dao of destruction and revival better than Kong Ji."My goal is only to enter the 4th rank ..."Li Hao thought to himself. At this moment, he finally made a decision. He would walk the path of Nirvana, revival, and continue the path of life and death. In fact, light and darkness and the five elements were not bad. Li Hao did not think that they were bad, nor did he not know how to do them. It was just that light and darkness and the five elements were not necessarily compatible with life and death.In fact, the five elements were one of his considerations.The secret technique of five birds!He had been cultivating the secret skill of five birds for a long time. He had comprehended the five Forces and had a fierce heart. Cultivating the five elements was actually a solution. Moreover, he had also obtained the comprehension of water and fire, one at the sixth level venerable sovereign and the other at the seventh level venerable sovereign.But after thinking for a while, Li Hao gave up.If he were to cultivate the five elements Dao, he would have to obtain a large amount of five elements power in the future. The five elements Dao was the main cultivation for ordinary people and also for his teacher.If there was an opportunity in the future, such as when his teacher and the others entered the venerable sovereign realm, the power of the five elements would be in great demand.If everyone went to cultivate the five elements, then the resources they obtained ... Would not be enough to be shared.He had also taken this into consideration. Since the five elements were similar to Nirvana revival, it was better to choose Nirvana revival. The five elements could be cultivated as a secondary path, but in the end, he would still have to cultivate the five elements Dao. However, it could not be regarded as the main path between the fourth and sixth ranks.In fact, Li Hao had also had the opportunity to comprehend the light and dark type of level eight Taoist connotation. In the light type, in fact, Kong Ji had some enlightenment. In addition, Li Hao himself had practiced the light sword with aunt light for a while ... Although aunt light was very weak, it couldn't be said that her light Dao was completely wrong.

2804 Chapter 463
It was just that ... After thinking about it, he decided not to.Now, he was on good terms with Kong Ji. If he cultivated light and darkness and could not advance to the next level, he would have to kill people ... At that time, his first thought would be to go to the great light world and kill a few venerable sovereigns for fun ... Wouldn't that be a conflict?After considering these factors, he finally decided to choose Nirvana revival.The power of the great DAOs was secondary to the recovery of Nirvana.The key was to see more and comprehend more.The destruction and recovery of the world, the destruction and recovery of the Dao ... All of these were resources for Li Hao's advancement.All kinds of thoughts emerged in his mind, and Li Hao's River of Life and death emerged.At this moment, stars were spinning in the Galaxy.The life and death Star hung high in the sky.This was Li Hao's strongest Dao, the Dao of life and death."Nirvana ..."Li Hao mumbled. Although he knew Nirvana, he had yet to condense a Nirvana star. To condense a Nirvana star, perhaps ... He still needed a bit of luck.What opportunity?At this moment, Li Hao looked at the river of life and death. After a long time, he smiled."Senior second cat, the sword tree, sword stone, and sword seal, please leave my River of Life and death!"The void trembled."What do you want now?" second cat was getting impatient.How annoying!I just want to sleep in peace for a while.The three spirits from sword city emerged from the river. The three of them had been maintaining and strengthening Li Hao's River of Life and death, and they were much stronger than before.As Li Hao continued to advance, although the three of them had yet to reach venerable sovereign level, they were actually the heavens, the land, and the spirit of the river of life and death."Great Nirvana!"Li Hao said,'I'm going to cultivate the Dao of Nirvana and destroy the river and the world! While you're at it, I'll reforge the river of life and death. "Second cat was stunned."Again?"This wasn't the first time Li Hao had started over.Every time this fellow made great progress, he would overturn some of the previous DAOs and re-cultivate. There were good and bad things about this. The good thing was that the stronger he was, the more he would comprehend, and the re-cultivation would be more perfect.However, there were also disadvantages ... Every time he used it, he would waste a huge amount of energy.It was also a waste of time.Li Hao nodded."This time, I gained a lot of insights in Tian Fang, but I haven't had the time to integrate them into my own system, including the Dragon priest's body as a wall and the domain structure of the five elements ... Since I'm preparing to cultivate Nirvana, I want to destroy the river and the world, in preparation for the true birth of a great Dao universe and a great Dao world in the future!"Second cat didn't say anything this time.The three spirits in the air would not say anything. Li Hao, on the other hand, still remembered his Bluff ... Or rather, his promise. He looked at the three of them, then at Jian Shu, and said,"Senior sword tree, when I took you away, I said that you would form your own world ... Instead of being suppressed by me in the river!""This time ... Perhaps it's also an opportunity for you seniors to escape,""I want to try using my body as a wall, my great Dao as a Foundation, and my domain as a domain ..." Li Hao explained."I want to create an incomplete world ... This way, you seniors can leave the river."Leave?Becoming a world by himself?Back then, the three of them had been looking forward to it ... But now, after following Li Hao, they had actually seen more and seen the cruelty of chaos. Now that the three of them had left, if Li Hao gave them a chance, they might really have a chance to form their own world ... A small world without a great Dao.Yes, when they were combined, there was hope of completing the forging of a small world, or an unranked small world.But ... That would be so low-level!"Are you going to abandon us?" Jian Shu asked directly.“……”These words!Li Hao was speechless. I'm giving you freedom. In my River, you're not free and can't move.Wu Shan had previously said that he wanted freedom the most. Thus, even if it was the orders of the Lord of the clouds, he could still disobey.Li Hao thought that the three of them were quite miserable.It wasn't easy for his River to be tormented time and time again. If the three of them were to leave, he wouldn't dare to say what he would do to them, but as long as he was willing to pay a price, there was still a great chance of helping them create a small world.At that time, the three of them would be the world Lords ... Or the world Spirits, or the world will.Three parts of the world!A small world could also accommodate several venerable sovereigns. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  ,m All three of them would become venerable sovereigns and rule a small world ... That wasn't too bad either. They could be their own Kings.Was this considered abandonment?It's very uncomfortable here.Li Hao liked to be tormented. Were these people happy to be struck by lightning every now and then in his long river?"Where are senior stone and senior sword seal?"The stone turned into a strong man ... At this moment, he seemed to be a little confused as he replied in a daze,""I'll follow the sword tree. "“……”Was this the legendary story of a rock swearing to follow a tree with its life?The sword seal was as majestic as ever."There's no hurry to open a world. We're not familiar with the chaos now. Even if we really open a world, we could be destroyed at any time in the current situation. Why don't we continue to take root in the river and gain some experience?"Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded."That's fine ... Since the three of you don't want to leave, you can stay here. However, you should come out first. My winding river isn't perfect yet. I'll continue to perfect it!"In the past, when he was weak, he felt that the long river was heaven and earth, the world, and the universe.Only now did Li Hao understand that a long river was just a long river.

2805 Chapter 463
He was still far from the real world.The biggest difference was ... Creating life.Even small worlds could give birth to living creatures naturally, but his River couldn't do that. After coming into contact with some high-level powers last time, Li Hao realized that perhaps it was only possible to give birth to some living creatures in the world he created when he reached Level Seven.To establish a complete system, including the life system.Li Hao couldn't do any of this.Even if he were to create a world for stone and the others ... It would only be an empty world. At most, it would contain some Dao and not life.Li Hao was still far from being able to do this.He chased them out. As soon as they came out, Jian Shu and the other cultivators who were not venerable sovereigns felt a little uncomfortable. The chaos seemed to want to cover them. Fortunately, they had experienced the edification of the long river and could barely hold on.In addition, Li Hao and the others were nearby, so it was not a big problem.If it was an ordinary cultivator who had not reached the venerable sovereign level, they might have been devoured by chaos.The chaos looked peaceful, but it was actually very dangerous.Li Hao ignored them and looked at the river of life and death. Soon, he fished out a star from the river and looked at Qian Wuliang. Qian Wuliang knew that he had left the Silvermoon world and couldn't show the universe of Dao, but he could show the river of Dao.The river of the path emerged and contained the star within.He didn't dare to mix other forces in the surroundings. Instead, he opened up a place to accommodate the star, because he knew who the star belonged to. Perhaps, it was the only star of the great path in Li Hao's River of Life and death that belonged to an outsider.After taking out Lin Hongyu's life and death Star, Li Hao glanced at the river. At this moment, it was slightly turbulent with the departure of the three spirits.However, it did not collapse.This also meant that the three spirits were no longer the core of the long river.In fact, Li Hao had been working hard to stabilize the river. He had integrated many of his DAOs and physical strength into the regional wall. He didn't rely entirely on the support of the three spirits.Otherwise, the three cultivators who were not even venerable sovereigns would not be able to support the current River of Life and death.Looking at the lonely river, Li Hao closed his eyes and pondered for a while.A moment later, a Bridge of Life and death suddenly collapsed in the starry sky!The Bridge of Life and death, which he had built with great difficulty, collapsed directly and instantly turned into a stream of primitive energy. The next moment, the two stars on both sides of the bridge, one illusory and one real, suddenly disappeared!Nirvana did not mean shattering.It was not destruction.It was just that all the auras, all the orthodoxies, and all the power of the great Dao instantly stopped. It was somewhat similar to the pause of time, but the energy was still active When Time Stopped.At this time, the energy was no longer active.Heibao, Qian Wuliang, and the three spirits and the two cats were all watching with curiosity.The power of Nirvana!Li Hao continued to destroy bridges of life and death. These bridges turned into primordial energy and fused with the river below. The stars fell into a deathly silence. The entire River seemed to have stopped flowing.Little by little, it wasn't a one-time thing, nor was it like the void that destroyed everything in an instant. Li Hao destroyed the bridges one by one, causing the stars to stagnate.At this moment, other than the life and death Stars, which still had some radiance, all the other stars in the entire starry sky had turned into a deathly color. It was somewhat similar to Tian Fang's great Dao universe.The long river below was still flowing slowly, and the power of the great Dao was overflowing.Li Hao didn't care about the energy.Qian Wuliang took a look at it ... Seeing that Li Hao didn't care about it, he carefully absorbed all of them.Li Hao turned his head and glanced at him.Qian Wuliang was a bit embarrassed.The Marquis had high standards and felt that this energy was a little impure, but ... Damn it, almost all of this energy came from venerable sovereigns and had actually been purified by Li Hao many times. No matter how impure it was, it was still purer than the energy of ordinary venerable sovereigns.The Marquis may dislike it, but I don't dislike it!It wasn't good to lose it for no reason.Li Hao didn't say much. The river of the path also had the effect of purification. It was just that the energy he had expelled was absorbed by the other party ... It was similar to being eaten after taking a dump ...Cough cough!Li Hao didn't say anything, since Qian Wuliang probably wouldn't care even if he did.This fellow was thick-skinned and extremely shameless. Nirvana had eliminated the stars and eliminated some energy, but there was still a lot of dark energy left. This was also caused by absorbing too much dark energy in the dark Demon Ridge. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, the flowing river was also being extinguished by Li Hao. Bit by bit, the entire River stopped flowing.The life and death Star in the sky also slowly stopped.Inch by inch, the river of life and death entered the state of Nirvana, as if it was frozen in the chaos. Li Hao's aura also dropped a lot. Black Panther glanced at Qian Wuliang alertly ...Qian Wuliang felt helpless.What are you looking at me for?Do I still dare to launch a sneak attack now?This dog, what was he thinking?Many people want to kill Li Hao, but I'm definitely not one of them!I've never dared to go against him since Silver Moon. He's a venerable sovereign of the Daoist master's Imperial world, and I, Silver Moon, am the opposite, alright?Li Hao didn't care about what they were thinking.The entire River was destroyed.At this moment, he began to prepare to condense the Nirvana star. In the long river, a force of Nirvana Rose ...

2806 Chapter 463
What was Nirvana?Li Hao didn't know if he had comprehended the same thing as emptiness. In his opinion, if he compared people, Nirvana meant deep sleep, which was different from death. Nirvana meant a chance of revival, while the revival of death was called reincarnation.Waves of energy rose up, and the power of the great Dao began to gather.A dim star gradually appeared in the void, standing beside the life and death Star.However, compared to the life and death Star, this newly-born star was extremely weak and incomplete. What Li Hao wanted was to merge the power of destruction, revival, and recovery. At this moment, he had only extracted some power of destruction, not the power of revival.……Just as Li Hao was preparing to enter the 4th step in seclusion ...In the dark Demon Ridge.After Kong Ji finished comprehending life and death, he stepped into the dark hall and started to pass the first stage. He had to deal with some newly born Yin swirls. He wanted to pass the first stage and then comprehend the Dao chess. He was also preparing to step into the sixth rank.Today, Tian Fang had already attracted a rank seven venerable sovereign. Rank five venerable sovereign was no longer Tian Fang's ceiling strength, and neither was rank six.Grade-7 or even grade-8 would be the key to Tian Fang's success.……Outside the dark Demon Ridge.The four realm gates of tianfang were all sealed. This order came from a venerable sovereign from a great world, Wu Shan!Who would dare disobey the order of monarch Wushan to close the four realm gates?As for Wu Shan, he didn't do anything. He just found a place and was carefree ... But the entire Tian Fang was shaken. A seventh rank venerable sovereign came to Tian Fang, sealed the great world, and disappeared. Who didn't know why?It was definitely to monopolize the great Dao universe!Tian Fang's great Dao universe!For a time, all kinds of news spread to all sides through some special means.The carefree Wu Shan had also received a message from the cloud Master.In a restaurant.A shadow seemed to appear in front of Wu Shan. The Lord of the clouds said in a serious voice,""Wushan, has the tianfang universe really recovered?"Wu Shan nodded."It's really resurrected ... Of course, it's not completely resurrected. It's only a portion!" I'm still investigating ..."Then, he added,"as for the person who killed Chi Yun ... I didn't find him, but I guessed it was the Silver Moon King. I can't be bothered with it. It's not as important as a big world or a universe, so I asked the sacred central crypt to take it on. He's friends with that guy, and three medium-level worlds will be his compensation!""Silver Moon King?"The Lord of the clouds 'heart moved, and he looked at Wu Shan.""Mingtang accepted the challenge?""Yes,""It's quite interesting," ​ "Are you sure that the universe of the great path has recovered?"As for Chi Yun's death, it wasn't too important now. With the Son of God of light being willing to admit his debt and compensate them with three medium-level worlds, this matter was considered over.Could it be that he would kill the son of the radiant sovereign for Chi Yun?"I'm sure!"Wu Shan nodded. This was also a fact. The tianfang great Dao universe had recovered, but it wasn't the entire universe. It was only a part.Without the Silver Moon King, he could no longer open it.But I didn't lie.The cloud Master pondered for a while and said,""Have you found it now?""Not yet, I'm still looking for it.""We should be able to find some traces," Wu Shan said with a smile."It's said that it has given birth to a ninth-rank Emperor pressure, is that true?""It's true. I've observed it from a distance." Wu Shan nodded again."It might not be the aura of the tianfang master, but ... The might of the monarch weapon might come from tianfang world, or it might be in the tianfang great Dao universe, and the recovery of the great Dao universe activated the might of the weapon."The cloud Master seemed to be in deep thought again.After a long time, he said,"you sealed tianfang and alerted the enemy. The Crimson Moon and the light believe that tianfang's great Dao universe has recovered. If that's the case, there will be a lot of trouble."With that, he said softly,"Wushan, with your wisdom, even if you really detect the recovery of the great Dao universe ... You should act in secret. You shouldn't be so flamboyant. What you're doing will make people believe you even more. It'll be even harder for you to let go."Wu Shan didn't have such a personality. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Even if he did, he shouldn't have made such a big fuss. Instead, he should have been looking for an opportunity in secret.Now, you've caused such a big commotion and sealed off the Skyland world. The Skyland world lacks everything, but it doesn't lack spies from the other worlds. They didn't believe you at first, but now they do."I know!" Wu Shan nodded. It's just that it's hard to take over the Tian Fang great Dao universe. I'm afraid that there will be rank eight venerable sovereigns coming. It might be you, the realm Lord, the radiant master, the red moon master, the Dragon Realm master, or someone else ... It'll be very difficult for me to take it. ""If that's the case," Wu Shan smiled."The more Level Seven venerable sovereigns that come, the better. Perhaps I can even take the opportunity to seek out a great Dao universe."The cloud Master was silent.After a while, he said,"have you lost your patience after all these years?"Wu Shan shook his head,"it's not that I'm impatient, it's just that ... Realm Lord, at my level, it's normal for me to seek some freedom." I have no intention of betraying Yunxiao, it's just that I don't want to stay in Yunxiao forever and imprison myself. What do you think, realm Lord?"The cloud Master fell silent once again.This person was a capable general of the cloud world.Among the seventh rank venerable sovereigns in the cloud sky, Wu Shan was the smartest and the most useful.In fact, he could tell that Wu Shan had some thoughts, independent thoughts. However, at this time, they were in a stalemate with the light and red Moon, and they had lost a top seventh level venerable sovereign ...

2807 Chapter 463
"Wushan, if you truly can conspire to take over a part of the universe, what will you do if Yunxiao is in trouble?"Wu Shan sighed,"Yunxiao is in trouble, so I'll do my best!" However ... Realm Lord, this is a problem. Someone has invaded our cloud sky. If you want to rule the primal Chaos and become a rank nine, I, a rank seven venerable sovereign, am powerless to participate. ""Your power comes from the clouds!"Cloud Master frowned slightly,'if you want freedom, I won't stop you! However, you have to remember that your power, your mantras, and everything you have all come from the cloud world. Even if you are independent, you will take away the foundation of the cloud world!" "I understand," Wu Shan nodded after a moment of silence."That's all. Think about it. Also ... If the time is right, I might go to tianfang myself!"Wu Shan slightly nodded and didn't say anything.It was only when the cloud Lord's aura dissipated that he let out a breath and sighed.My power comes from the clouds.That's true!This was also the reason why some Dao Masters were unwilling to let venerable sovereigns leave. They could leave, but they had to leave behind all their energy and orthodoxies.Otherwise, if a rank seven severed his great Dao and teleported away, it would be a huge loss to a major world."The power of the seventh step ...""I can't do it." Wu Shan mumbled. He wanted to take away all his power. Maybe ... He should kill a seventh rank venerable sovereign, take away his power of the great path, and merge with the cloud world. This way, he could make up for the loss he had left behind.At that time, cloudsky wouldn't have anything to say."All these years, I've also made great contributions to Yunxiao. I killed a level Seven venerable sovereign and filled the gap. It doesn't affect the entire Yunxiao. After I leave, a new level Seven venerable sovereign can be born in the cloud world ... Neither side will lose anything."The Crimson Moon?"Hong Yue and Guang Ming were both level eight worlds. Level Seven venerable sovereigns were not weak, but they were not as strong as the Lords of Level Seven major worlds because they had the power of the world and the power of the great path universe.It was hard to kill Dao Masters and world Masters.However, these Grade 7 experts were actually relatively easier to kill.A neo martial human king who could kill a seventh-rank great Dao master was a true top seventh-rank venerable sovereign. Wushan admitted his inferiority."Then it's settled!"If Yunxiao was still unwilling to let me leave at that time, it would be fine if we parted on good terms, but I made up for all my losses and worked for Yunxiao for nearly a million years. I've paid back what I should have paid back. You can't expect me to work for you for the rest of my life, right?"Realm Lord ... I hope we can part on good terms!"Wu Shan smiled as he looked outside the realm gate. His eyes revealed a cold light.As for who it was for, he didn't know.Perhaps, the Crimson Moon was still his first choice.'Killing a seventh level Crimson Moon just so happens to attract all of the Crimson Moon's attention. I'll complete the compensation for cloud world and fulfill my promise to the Silver Moon King. I'll weaken some of the Crimson Moon and let neo martial and Crimson Moon continue their conquest. On the side of light, I'll be on good terms with Kong Ji. At that time, if I become independent ... At least, only cloud world will make things difficult for me.'When that time comes ... Don't blame me for being ruthless!At this moment, Wu Shan took a deep look into the distance. Silver Moon King, neo martial, lonely god, light ...Tian Fang had recovered!Perhaps, my opportunity is also in tianfang.He smiled and disappeared again. Perhaps in a few days, he would have to welcome new guests.……As the tianfang great Dao universe recovered, a level nine pressure appeared in the various regions of the chaos. The Misty Mountain seal of the cloud world instantly shook.A level-nine universe! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, the venerable sovereigns, the most powerful venerable sovereigns, rushed toward Tian Fang.There were not only type 8 worlds in the various regions, but also many Type 7 worlds. The Lords of these worlds were naturally not willing to let go of such an opportunity, and the type 8 ones wanted to become type 9 overlords.Those at Level 7 also hoped to become level 8 and become the Overlord of a region!Tianfang was the biggest and most eye-catching opportunity for these advanced venerable sovereigns.At this moment, even the war in the Hongyue region was left behind by many people.The battle between a level 7 and level 8 world would not be decided so quickly.On the other hand, Tian Fang ... Was more interesting!……At the same time.Near the red moon zone, a young man with a blade sensed the top venerable sovereigns moving in one direction. He was a little confused.After a moment, he thought for a while and laughed.Perhaps, something good had happened.I'll also go and join in the fun!In an instant, the saber-wielding youth disappeared and flew toward Tian Fang."Join in the fun, I'll do it."Nearby, it seemed that several major cosmos absolute beings had run away with their worlds. There must be something fun, interesting, and even an opportunity. As for Red Moon, let's put it aside for now and go take a look!On the way, he also caught a world Lord and inquired about it. The other party was only a medium-level world Lord. The sword-wielding teenager only caught him and asked a few questions before quickly disappearing.Not long later, in the world of the Crimson Moon.Red Moon master had also received some news.The new martial human King had left the red moon region.He didn't know if he had really left or if he did it on purpose. According to the information, he might have gone to tianfang world. Red Moon master was a little hesitant.The news came that Wu mountain had sealed off the heaven. The great Dao universe might really have recovered.Hong Yue had already sent two level Seven venerable sovereigns ... Putting light and cloud aside, even the neo martial human Kings had gone to join in the fun. This guy was at the top of Level Seven. If he had obtained an opportunity in Tian Fang, he might even enter level eight.

2808 Chapter 463
To him, this was a huge threat.Ordinary tier seven people were no match for neo martial human Kings.What to do?At this moment, he was also a little hesitant. Should I go there personally?If he went there in person ... Once the new warrior human king and emperor Cang used a diversion tactic, it would be very troublesome to attack Red Moon. Red Moon would need at least two seventh-rank experts to guard it.As for Hong Yue, there were only four grade-7 experts, and two of them had already left for Tian Fang.Should he recall the remaining two?Or ... Should he wait and see?If Ji Huo and ye mo went, they might be able to gain a firm foothold.Many thoughts emerged in Red Moon Lord's mind. She was still worried that this was the scheme of the neo martial human King. After thinking about it, she made a decision. She would wait for at least the news from Yunxiao and Guangming before making a decision.Hong Yue had lost two rank-7s, but it seemed like she was still able to hold on."It's better to continue to keep an eye on those two fellows in the celestial pole ... Emperor Cang's whereabouts are unknown, it's the great Red Moon taboo! Now, the Silver Moon King will most likely meet up with these people. The key is to capture him, capture Silver Moon, and find the exact location of the Yin Yang!"At this moment, he was actually not staring at some of the strong people of neo martial.Li Hao and the others were actually wrong.At this point, Red Moon master's goal was no longer to kill a few weak neo martial artists. It was meaningless.He wanted to capture Li Hao and the Silvermoon world!From there, he could deduce the exact location of Emperor Cang.They even ... Killed Emperor Cang and destroyed the homeland of neo martial.This was the key!At present, on the side of neo martial, Heaven's Fate and King Huai were clearly in one place. Everyone knew this, and so did the Silver Moon King. The Silver Moon King could not meet up with the other neo martial experts. This was the only place where he could meet up.Therefore, even though Tian Fang had made a big move, Red Moon master still decided to wait and see.No hurry!Let's keep a close eye on this side first.The seventh rank venerable sovereign's target was not venerable the sword and the others, but Li Hao. Li Hao had yet to realize this. In his eyes, venerable the sword was still more important than him.Even if someone was watching Hong Yue, their target would be to kill a few level six venerable sovereigns of the neo martial artists or to ambush a level Seven venerable sovereign like the sun god.And not him!However, the fact was that the red moon Lord was only doing this for Li Hao and the Silver Moon world. The red moon Lord's target was bigger, and killing a few people wouldn't change anything. The biggest threat to the red moon was that the new martial artists 'whereabouts were unknown. Emperor Cang had devoured the entire yin-yang world and disappeared without a trace. The enemy was in the dark while he was in the light, which was the key to the red moon Lord's confidence in clamoring.……Li Hao didn't care about all this.Deep in the chaos.At this moment, Li Hao had completely condensed a Dark Star, which felt a little empty. Just because he had condensed Nirvana star didn't mean that he could reach Level 4. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The entire River was still in a state of silence.Only recovery was the key to entering the 4th rank.Li Hao had experience in resurrecting people.The resurrection of Yuan Shuo and the others that day was actually a kind of resurrection. It was not reincarnation because the origin of their great Dao was still there, which meant that their Natal stars were still there. It was a kind of hibernation, so it was a kind of resurrection.Li Hao and Lin Hongyu were the only ones who walked the path of life and death.Now, it was not a person who was going to be resurrected, but a long river, and all the great DAOs that Li Hao controlled.Beside him was a powerful corpse, whose energy was constantly overflowing.Red Cloud!In order to repair the river and advance, this time, this person's body might be used up. Of course, when he reached rank 4, it didn't matter whether he had this rank 6 body or not.Li Hao took a deep breath.He had gained some insights from the void, but the void's own insights were incomplete. It would still be difficult for him to fuse the Nirvana recovery.The river shook a few times, but there was no sign of recovery.Li Hao frowned slightly. The path of recovery was more difficult than he had expected.Entering the 4th rank could be considered a threshold. This was also the key to his second transformation.However, he seemed to be lacking some opportunity.I'm at the fourth step, is it that easy to advance?As he was thinking, the few people who were staring at him suddenly said,""The Nirvana meltdown's awakening will definitely be accompanied by Primal Chaos lightning tribulation! If that's the case...Why don't we merge time with it? no matter how long it has been in dormancy, there will still be a day when it revives. Otherwise, it won't be dormancy anymore. If time flows with it, perhaps the River of Heaven and earth will be able to revivate on its own ... And gain a hint of an opportunity to revive!"Li Hao was startled and turned his head to look.Second cat had a lazy posture. When Li Hao looked at it, it yawned. Why are you looking at me?I'm cute, right?Li Hao was a little surprised. Second cat had the power of a second stage venerable sovereign.But sometimes, he could see through some crucial points.Right!Flowing time!Time flowed with the flow of time, allowing the world to recover naturally. No matter how silent it was, it was not death. As time passed, there would still be a day when it would recover. As long as he seized this opportunity, he would definitely be able to understand some of the key to recovery."Many thanks!"Li Hao didn't say much. He instantly condensed time, and dark clouds vaguely appeared in the void, but they weren't too obvious this time. He only used the normal power of time, not the power beyond his own.Furthermore, the fusion of Nirvana, revival, and rebirth would definitely attract the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. If he successfully comprehended it and advanced to the fourth stage, he could transcend it all at once and save himself some trouble.Time passed quickly. At this moment, Li Hao was also constantly observing the changes in the river.The long river of destruction did not show any signs of recovery.Perhaps there wasn't enough time.The dark clouds in the sky were gradually increasing.Li Hao didn't care. He had seen a seventh-stage lightning tribulation, and even if the current one was successfully gathered, it would only be at the fourth stage. He had even defeated a seventh-stage one, so why would he care about this?If he could successfully advance, he would be able to break it easily!On the other hand, Qian Wuliang was scared to death, feeling that he would be struck to death sooner or later.Time slowly passed.Gradually, the destructive power of the long river seemed to have dissipated a lot. In the sky, there were stars that started to shine. Their energy was extremely weak, as if they were waking up from their destructive state.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flashed with joy.For the first time, the power of time, other than killing people, had given him great help in comprehending key DAOs."The Dao of time ... Is the Dao itself. Killing people is only secondary ... Next time, use it less to kill people. It's better to use it more to comprehend the Dao ..."Li Hao was overjoyed. At this moment, he slowly came to a realization.The end of Nirvana was revival.It was as if the end of death was a new life.These two things seemed to be closely related. He might be able to gain something from this.The stars began to recover one by one. A special power of recovery was born in the long river. Above the long river, some light appeared on the dead star.The end of Nirvana meant revival.The river was turbulent!The power of thousands of great DAOs began to recover.Above his head, a dark cloud quickly gathered. Li Hao also felt the destructive energy in his body quickly become active. It even began to merge with many other forces, bathing Li Hao in a special energy. His whole body began to advance. Qian Wuliang, Heibao, and ermao were all relieved.As for the dark clouds above their heads, they would have been scared to tears in the past.Now ... These few people seemed to have gotten used to it. It was a small problem. They had already dealt with the seventh-tier lightning tribulation. A mere fourth-tier, even if it had reached the fifth-tier, it would not be a problem.At this moment, Li Hao's River of Life and death was also changing rapidly.It was no longer the two powers of life and death that were the main force. Instead, two more powers appeared and began to merge with each other. The long river roared violently.Li Hao was about to advance again.Tier 4!

Chapter 2809 A Coincidental Encounter (1)
Life and death, Nirvana, revival.The great Dao merged, stars appeared, and the long river fluctuated.At this moment, dark clouds loomed over the chaos.The primal Chaos lightning tribulation reappeared!Qian Wuliang and the others all felt that they had finally succeeded ... But the next moment, second cat suddenly turned his head and looked in a direction with a helpless look.Was Li Hao a troublemaker?It seemed like an expert had come!So what if this fellow was advancing? every time he did, he would bring along dark clouds and lightning tribulations. Although the primordial chaos was vast, the appearance of a primordial chaos lightning tribulation would still easily attract some attention.This is troublesome!As er Mao was thinking, Qian Wuliang seemed to have sensed it as well. He turned around and was shocked.In the chaos, a cultivator floated in the air.At this moment, the cultivator seemed to be a little surprised and surprised as he looked over.Er Mao and the other venerable sovereigns were all shocked by his glance.So strong!There didn't seem to be any powerful aura, but he could walk freely in the primal Chaos, so he was at least a venerable sovereign. Moreover, he came very quickly and was stronger than they felt. He was at least a middle-stage venerable sovereign.The person didn't look too old. He was middle-aged and seemed somewhat refined ... From his temperament, he didn't look like a bad person. But who would carve the word 'bad' on their face these days?The venerable sovereigns said nothing and quickly blocked the way.The man didn't mind. He glanced at Li Hao, then at second cat, and then at Black Panther and the others.At this moment, Li Hao had also sensed the approaching people, but he closed his eyes and said nothing.At this moment, the power in his body was rolling. He was in a state of advancement and a state of transformation. At this time, he would drag it out as long as possible. If he really couldn't do it, he could accelerate time. However, the lightning tribulation would be stronger.The newcomer was very strong. After all, Li Hao had received some power of the seventh step before. Even if it was only an illusion, his perception was not weak.In an instant, he could sense how powerful the person was.It was at least Grade 5 and above, even Grade 6.There was a high probability that he was not at the seventh-rank.If it was a Grade 7, there would be a sense of suffocation across space.There was a high chance that he was a sixth stage venerable sovereign!At this time, even though he had entered the fourth stage, it was difficult for him to fight against a sixth stage. As for the fifth stage, Li Hao could try."Training?"The person's mind fluctuated for a while, and he revealed a playful smile, which suddenly made people feel that this smile was a little annoying."A 4th rank cultivator?"The middle-aged cultivator laughed again. Qian Wuliang, who was a bit vigilant, also showed a fake smile."Senior has good eyes, we are indeed cultivating. Are we disturbing senior?"However, he was extremely nervous.This was big trouble! He had advanced to the fourth stage of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, and the river of life and death was still present. Anyone with a brain could guess that Li Hao was the Silver Moon King!Red moon's offer wasn't low, even a sixth-grade one would be tempted. "I'm not disturbing you. I was just passing by and happened to sense some fluctuations in this place, so I came over to take a look. "The man laughed and then glanced at Li Hao. He seemed to be a little surprised.Life and death could be seen, but there seemed to be something else.Nirvana?Very few people cultivated this Dao.The Nirvana has begun to revive ... The way of the two extremes?That Dao River ... It was not the long river of the great Dao, but a man-made long river of the great Dao. It was quite bold.Was this the Silver Moon King?Just as Qian Wuliang thought, anyone with a slightly smarter mind would have guessed that this man was the new king of Silvermoon."Little friends, are you going to undergo tribulation?"The man laughed heartily, but it also seemed a little hypocritical ... Even Qian Wuliang felt a little uncomfortable with this smile.He was already on high alert!"The chaos lightning tribulation isn't easy to overcome, but from the looks of it, that fellow Daoist is probably quite confident in his chances."Qian Wuliang forced a smile."You don't have to worry about us. We will try our best ... Senior, this is our first time meeting you. Please make it convenient for us. We will repay you in the future.""There's no need for that. "The middle-aged cultivator laughed. He glanced at Li Hao and then at second cat. He laughed, and it was a meaningful laugh.Qian Wuliang's expression changed.As for second cat, he was a little suspicious and looked at the cultivator. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "It's fate that we met!"The cultivator suddenly spoke."The young friend inside, it looks like you're about to succeed in your advancement. You've advanced to the fourth stage of life and death, Nirvana, and resurrection. You're not considered weak anymore. You have a place in the chaos!"Li Hao did not say anything."Since we've met this time, why don't we have a Dao discussion?"Li Hao opened his eyes, looked at the other side, and slightly frowned. Su Hao quickly frowned and said softly,""Senior's invitation is more than I can ask for!"He took a look and suddenly felt that this person ... Seemed somewhat familiar.What a strange feeling!"Before we discuss the Dao," the cultivator said,"I have something to ask. I heard that the tianfang great Dao universe has appeared?""Right? I'm not too sure about the details. We're too weak ...""You must be joking, little fellow Daoist."The cultivator laughed again."This time, I want to go to tianfang to look for opportunities.
