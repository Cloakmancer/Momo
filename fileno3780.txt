One was a virgin boy, and the other was a virgin girl ... Alright, they were both old monsters.In the distance, another rank nine world was destroyed.In the past few days, neo martial arts had been attacking like crazy. Li Hao looked into the distance. It should be someone from neo martial arts doing the same.He frowned slightly.The human King ...The strength of a human King had definitely improved, but it shouldn't have reached the ninth rank yet.In the past, the human King had given up on time. He had not cultivated or even tried to comprehend it ... Li Hao admired this very much. But now, the human King was madly absorbing and devouring the various worlds.Could he use his body as a spirit to step into Grade 9?Li Hao was a little suspicious.It must be very difficult! During this period of time, the human Kings should have been filling up his inner world. After devouring many ninth level worlds, his inner world might have reached its limit. If it continued, it would not be a problem of energy.Instead, it was a problem of spirituality and Dao laws.A thousand years ago, after the human King suppressed the new martial arts, there was a silence for a thousand years. The human King was only in his twenties when he suppressed the new martial arts. In these few years, he had made rapid progress. However, in a thousand years, the human King had only advanced from the peak of the sixth rank to the peak of the seventh rank.A thousand years, he had crossed a level.It was very fast.It was slow ... But relatively speaking, it was average.Li Hao looked at him and didn't say anything. He was lost in thought. As for the human King ... Li Hao could see through him at a glance. The human King was a forthright person, but he also had his own secrets.In Li Hao's opinion, his biggest secret lay in the long-lost consort and the new martial world. Some of the venerable sovereigns who had disappeared were not very famous, but they were all related to the human King.The king's wife, the king's sister ... These people had never appeared.Of course, he said that he was cultivating inside.They had even encountered the celestial pole Huai King and the others ... However, they had never appeared in the few times they had self-destructed.The feeling that the human King gave people was that he was open and bright!However, Li Hao had also gone through neo martial arts before ... Was the human King really that open and honest?"People like the princess Consort and Fang Yuan have almost never appeared before. The human Emperor told me last time that he would feel more at ease after having a wife and children ... Could it be that he has children?"Li Hao touched his chin. If there was one ... Where did the human King send the person?Was he still in the neo martial world?Although the primal Chaos was huge, it was only so big. Moreover, the human King had always been active in the square region and had never left the Thunder region. Where could he have sent him?And now, Tian Fang and the others were more concerned about the cultivators of time. They ignored the human King.They felt that the limit of a human King was at most a rank nine, so he wasn't too much of a threat. However, they had to know that the human King knew how powerful time was, but he didn't take over!This point alone was already unbelievable!They didn't even allow people from new martial arts to take over, not even Zhi Zun.Why was he so sure that Shi Guang would be a huge problem?Even if he didn't want it, there was a group of people in new martial arts who would want it. Why not give it to others?Could it be that ... He was simply afraid that others would surpass him?"Heibao ... Where do you think the human King sent his family?"  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao murmured. The human King was frighteningly protective of his own family. Even in the chaotic new martial era, where other people died in battle and the human King had narrowly escaped death several times, his sister and parents were still alive and well.This guy, who was a thousand years older than him, was actually very selfish ... However, the neo martial artists all tacitly agreed because the human King used his own life to bear the responsibility of the neo martial arts.His family enjoyed some special privileges, so no one said anything.Woof! Woof! Woof!Black Panther shook his head. He did not know, he was not sure.Li Hao chuckled. Right, it was a waste of time to ask."Teacher's spirit is still in the New World. If he comes out this time, teacher has always been well-prepared, but of course, it can also be said that he's one step slower than others ... This time, his level 8 cultivation will definitely be stabilized! Whether or not I can reach the ninth step ... It's very difficult, I can't guarantee it. "Li Hao shook his head.Yuan Shuo ... He was talented and talented, but his luck had always been bad. He was always a step slower than others. Even though he had accumulated a lot, he was still ... A bit more unlucky and miserable.This time, in new world, if he could seize the opportunity ... He would most likely be one step slower than the others. Therefore, Li Hao didn't have any hope that his teacher would become the master of new world!Yes, he didn't hold any hope.However, with his teacher's personality, talent, and judgment, even if he couldn't become the new Lord of heaven, he could at least occupy a place.To become the strongest among them."Teacher has lived in the new heaven for many years, so his spiritual nature must have become even stronger. He was already very strong back then, and once he regains his memories, he will only become even stronger ... This is the only chance I can give teacher ..."Li Hao laughed again,"I say I'm fair, but I'm actually not!" In the end, humans are somewhat selfish ... Teacher is skilled in the Dao of the five elements, so I set up some trouble for the Dao of the five elements in the new heaven. Whoever doesn't have the inheritance of the secret technique of five birds or the spirit of five birds ... Who fuses the five elements will die!"“……”Black Panther's eyes widened!F * ck!Li Hao rubbed the dog's head and smiled. When I left the Silver City, it was ... So difficult. How many people could help me? "Boss Liu and the others are old and not very talented. I'm willing to let them enjoy their lives ... But since teacher still wants to fight, how can I not give him a chance? Therefore, in the future world, if there is no master of the five elements, there must be ... Only teacher!"

Chapter 3781 A New Era (2)
It was decisive.This was also a rare technique he had left behind in the future world and the river of time.Perhaps, among the innate gods, there were also many who cultivated the five elements.Even the five elements!However, Li Hao could guarantee that the day anyone could completely master the five elements, apart from their own teacher ... Everyone else would be finished!Not only would he be done for, his own accumulation would be left in the five elements Dao, benefiting his teacher.This could be considered his last gift to Yuan Shuo as his disciple."In any case, I know that you've been dawdling all this time. You're slower than others in your awakening and cultivation. You're always half a beat slower in everything you do. Even old demon wuqin isn't suitable for you, but old demon wuqin is quite suitable.​ "If that's the case ... I'll let someone help you accumulate the power of the five elements. If you can walk out of it, teacher will definitely be able to control the five elements and become the future Overlord of the five elements!After talking about his teacher, Li Hao continued."I'm actually quite satisfied with boss Liu and the others who have left the silver Blizzard city and lived their lives peacefully. Teachers don't accept old age. As for you, you've been following me ..."The Black Panther raised its head."I don't like to dictate the fate of others ... But I still have to plan for you. I can't afford to take care of all Silver Moon cultivators, but I have no problem taking care of you and teacher!"That was because his teacher was slow and he had no choice but to make such arrangements.The Black Panther, on the other hand, didn't have much autonomy and was used to following Li Hao's orders. Thus, Li Hao had to make arrangements for its future."Back then, I made you switch to the Dao of calamity ... And you've made some progress ... But now, the chaos has the Lord of calamity. Even if you cultivate to the extreme, it'll be difficult for you to surpass him!"Heibao still didn't care.Li Hao laughed."You have to think carefully. If you can't grow up, I may not take you with me wherever I go in the future. How can you follow me if you're too weak?"Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther wagged its tail."I'll listen to you!"I'll do whatever you say."The power of tribulation is actually a kind of spiritual power, the power of will, and the Dao of tribulation. Relatively speaking, it's rather special ... The power of all disasters and tribulations is formed by the convergence!"Li Hao said,"I've done some experiments and simulations in new world. However, the results are average. Although some cultivators who can't endure the calamity might be born, they might not be able to rival the Lord of calamity.""Now, the chaos is facing calamity and chaos. Therefore, it is easy for the Dao of calamity and the Dao of chaos to improve during this period!"This was also the golden period of calamity and chaos.Of course, there were also deaths and massacres. There had been too many outbreaks recently, and for these cultivators, the recent period was the golden period of their cultivation."Dao master calamity saw me as his mortal enemy. I even killed his clone. He ... Hates me to the bone!""I'm afraid that I'll be the first one to get into trouble when this guy comes out!"Li Hao said with a smile."Heibao, I want you to do something, are you willing to do it?"Black Panther nodded. "I knew it, you're the most obedient!"  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao laughed. He patted the Black Panther's head and sighed. "It's not easy to get to where you are today ... It'll be very difficult for you to become the Lord of calamity. Only by passing through the biggest calamity will you have a chance of becoming the first choice of the spirit of calamity!"Heibao did not understand."What's the greatest calamity in the chaos?" Li Hao asked."Do you know what it is?"Black Panther shook his head.Li Hao smiled and said,"it's The Collapse of Chaos!" So ... What I want you to do, is actually not much different from what long Zhan did that day, but ... You have to be even more ruthless! Of course, the origin of chaos is very powerful, and it's almost impossible for a seventh-grade cultivator like you to defeat it ... But only in this way will you experience the greatest calamity in your dog life. Once you pass it ... You'll definitely have the opportunity to seize the spirit of the great Dao of the Lord of the calamity!"Black Panther opened his mouth wide.What?Destroy ... The origin of chaos?Is this a joke?A group of tier 9 guardians, how can I defeat them?Moreover, even if there was no one guarding it, long Zhan's Dragon Soul was powerful that day, right? in the end, taking a bite was also the limit.Chaos is powerful, right?Later on, he had self-destructed, but not even that had been enough to destroy the primordial chaos.It was a rank 7 dog that had relied on Li Hao to get to where it was today. How could it be defeated? even if it was defeated, the backlash from the entire chaos was definitely not something it could bear!Simply put ... It was a dead end!He couldn't be saved!"I'm just asking if you dare, whether you succeed or not ..."The Black Panther's tail wagged. He dared ... But he was courting death.It was a little confused, but then it thought of something. As a dog ... Why did it care so much?He nodded his head.It was doable!Li Hao laughed. "That's right, why would I harm you?"After saying that, he sent a voice transmission,'when I'm done with my work, you can disappear! No one will care too much about losing a dog ... On the day the New World appears, the attention of the chaos level nine will definitely be on the New World. On me, on the human King, on spring and autumn, on huntian, no one will care where you are!""You are the spirit of the Silver Moon ... And the Silver Moon universe, or any great Dao universe, is actually connected to the chaos great Dao!""On that day, if the chaos great Dao calms down, it's very likely that those tier 9 experts will descend from the depths of the chaos great Dao!"Li Hao continued to send a voice transmission."What you need to do is to sneak into the chaos great Dao at this moment. Your talent is actually hiding ... You need to hide from those level nines and hide in the depths of the chaos!"

Chapter 3782 A New Era (1)
Heibao felt like his head was about to explode.I'm just a tier 7, can I really hide from those tier 9 great DAOs that have merged with the chaos great Dao?Master, aren't you overestimating it?I'm just a dog. I can't do such a difficult task!Li Hao patted its head and said with a smile,""You can do it. Your greatest strength is that you can make people ignore you. They say that black dogs are rare. In the early years, when I was fighting with others, you hid it very well ...""Woof!""I know you're weak ... But it doesn't matter. If someone really does sense it, do you think a rank-nine would really care if a rank-seven dog went to the depths of the prime essences of chaos? In their eyes, you'll only die if you go. You can't even break through the chaos, so what can you do?"That's right!The Black Panther nodded and looked at Li Hao in confusion. You're right, but you said it yourself. How can I, a level Seven, pose a threat to the origin of chaos?Li Hao continued."It'll be very difficult for you to deal with the origin of chaos, but I suspect that ... There are some things in the origin of chaos. They are either Tian Fang's intelligence, or ... Someone else 's, or they were already there. The origin of chaos must have intelligence!""It's very difficult for you to do anything. All you need to do is ... Integrate! If you merge with it, you will be rejected by the others, and they might even kill you. If they want to kill you, their spirits will be stronger than yours, so you will be killed easily!"Heibao was innocent.And then?"At this time, what you need to do is to use someone else's hand to force the other party to use their Origin Energy. They have no choice but to teleport you away. They can't kill you. They can only teleport you to a suitable great Dao ... Such as ... The Dao of calamity!"The Black Panther was at a loss."He can kill me, but he doesn 'T. He even wants to help me ... This ... Is he dreaming again?"Li Hao transmitted a few words, and the Black Panther listened carefully. After a long time, its eyes flickered.Would it work?Forget it. It believed Li Hao's words, regardless of whether they worked or not.Who cares!Woof! Woof! Woof!"You know?""Woof!""When I'm done here, you can go. You don't have to tell anyone.""Woof!"Black Panther nodded.Li Hao exhaled and smiled. After making arrangements for Black Panther and his teacher, he didn't have much time to care about the others.As for Lin Hongyu ...Li Hao's head ached. In the past, he had only been joking. Of course, he had also weighed the pros and cons and made a choice. As a result ... He was in an awkward situation now."Death Qi ..."Murmuring, Li Hao also fell into deep thought.The Dao of death. In the chaos, the life and death Emperor had mastered the Dao of life and death. In the future world, he had suppressed a part of the Dao of death. Perhaps an expert with the Dao of death could be born. This meant that there were at least several experts who specialized in the death great Dao. Lin Hongyu did not have any advantage in this.One was an experienced level 9 cultivator, while the other was a future cultivator who had broken through a part of the level 9 Dao. Furthermore, he was a nomological Dao of death. It would be very difficult to surpass them and become a true top-notch cultivator of death!Lin Hongyu was only at the peak of the sixth rank when she left.Even if he had gained a lot this time, he could at most step into the seventh step. There was not much hope of reaching the eighth step.Level Seven, like the Black Panther, to take the initiative ... Was very, very difficult."Forget it, we'll see!"Moreover, one of his opponents might even be a powerful warrior under the future emperor. Women ... Were so strong, so there was not much meaning. He would see when the time came.At this moment, Li Hao had already thought of all these.As for the others, he didn't care.Let's just try our best and see what luck we have.If I really die in battle, at most, I'll resurrect you guys as well ..."Comfortable!"He suddenly laughed. He didn't have to worry about everyone now that he had fewer people to manage. He felt much more comfortable."In the past, I still had to consider everyone. Now, my strength has declined, and everyone is more proactive. It seems that I'm too strong, and the pressure on them is too great. Now, one by one, they're happily fighting with the neo martial artists. It's quite good.……On the other side.The human King devoured a large amount of energy. The energy in his body even began to overflow, turning into great Dao crystals. Clearly, he was somewhat saturated.His aura was getting stronger and stronger.At this moment, the human King was not any weaker than huntian. He burped and laughed. He was full.These days, he had been eating to his heart's content!Not only him, but all the neo martial artists had some gains and improved.However, unlike Li Hao, he had to satisfy himself first. He was the main force, and his philosophy was different from Li Hao 'S. He had to be the strongest to be able to charge at the front line.The strong had greater responsibilities.Therefore, he had to have the most spoils of war. The more he worked, the more he got.He had finally eaten his fill during this expedition. He burped and said,""I won't absorb the rest. Everyone, share it!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Hearing this, the others started to divide the loot.The Grandmaster approached and glanced at him, frowning slightly.""Level eight ... The peak?"At this moment, the human King's aura was intrepid. Compared to huntian, who had slaughtered in all directions, it did not feel much worse. It was just that ... He did not have the sense of invincibility that suppressed everything.In the eyes of the Autarchs, the chaos of the primordial chaos would ultimately be resolved and suppressed by the human King.As for Li Hao and the future ... They were not as reliable as their own people.

Chapter 3783 A New Era (1)
The human King would definitely be able to suppress all enemies of the chaos!No one could replace him.No one could lead neo martial, only the King of men.But now, the opportunities in the primordial chaos were almost all used up. Almost all the tier 9 worlds had been destroyed. In fact, even if there were more, it would not be of much use. At this time, what the human Kings lacked was some Foundation and opportunities.Otherwise ... He would be at his limit now. He was at the peak of level eight and was infinitely close to the 9000 great Dao, but he had not truly crossed this level."We've reached the top!"The human King nodded.The Grandmaster said in a deep voice,"then how about re-integrating the new martial arts?" Can it kill a ninth-rank?""Difficult!""No." The human King shook his head."At my level, even if all of you fuse together, my improvement will be limited!""Then ... We left some great Dao inheritances in the future world. If we ... Take them away, can they help you improve?" the Supreme martial artist suddenly asked.The human King chuckled."Alright, don't even think about it. It's fine if you're just telling me. This future world was created by Li Hao, so he has his own thoughts and ideas. Moreover ... Those who can rise in this new world are definitely not weak. Sun god also said that ... Strictly speaking, this future so-called Emperor Yu is one with me, neo martial, and silver Moon. We can even be considered as a closed loop!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "Although our new martial arts team is full of villains ... We can't go too far with our own people, right?"The Grandmaster sighed and didn't say anything else.He was not afraid of bearing a bad reputation, crimes, offending anyone, or even death. If the human King could stand at the peak of chaos again, he was willing to give up everything.However, the human King ... Was still extremely sentimental at times.Silver Moon was a future world. To the human King, it was also a part of his own neo martial world. They were of the same origin. If the other party did not take the initiative to find trouble, the human King would not take the initiative to scheme against them."I understand what you mean,""Yes." Zhi Zun nodded."As long as they don't take the initiative to attack my neo martial arts, I won't do anything to them ... Then you ...""Don't worry!"The human King laughed. It'll be fine ..."After saying that, he looked around and thought for a moment."Li Hao has his own plans. The guys from new world are not weaklings, and they have their own plans. I, neo martial, also need to have my own trump card ... I can't really be suppressed by others. ""Even if we can't suppress all our enemies, at least ... We can't be bullied!"The Grandmaster laughed."You've restrained yourself. In the past, you should have said that only you can suppress everything. Today, your requirements are too low."Fang ping chuckled."Be more humble. Keep a low profile. One can't be too arrogant!"“……”The Grandmaster couldn't help but laugh.The human King laughed again."This time, bring back all your assets. At this point, there's no need to hide. Of course, it's enough as long as you and I know!"Grandmaster's heart stirred. He looked at Fang ping, and after a long time, he said,"Are you sure? Even if something happens to neo martial, you ... Can still save them, but if ...""It's fine. To be honest, a thousand years ... I think it's enough!"The human King laughed carefreely,"humans have lived for a thousand years. They are old demons among humans. There's nothing not worth it!" Back then, I couldn't bear to do anything to them because ... Everyone was too young and didn't have time to enjoy anything. Now, neo martial arts enjoy a thousand years of peace ... I'm not sad that they're all dead!" His tone was much calmer,"you're like this, so am I!" "A thousand years isn't short. In these thousand years, my neo martial arts has been peaceful and peaceful. We have to live with some meaning. Is there any meaning to always coveting longevity?""So what if I can live forever?""Of course, even if I, a neo martial artist, die, I will never commit suicide like I did in battle. If I die, I will die in an awe-inspiring manner!"He laughed heartily."I'll kill them all. At most, I'll push them back and start all over again. We'll all die together. Waiting for chaos to be born and start a new era is not a bad idea. I don't want to die and have my enemies laugh heartily after cutting off my head and using it as a wine cup!""I won 't!"The Supreme martial artist was resolute and decisive."Don't worry. When that day comes, no one can kill you and survive!"The human King chuckled and patted the Supreme martial artist, sighing,""It's a pity that you didn't have a daughter. Why don't you get a concubine ..."He said."You've got some guts!""I have a granddaughter!" Grandmaster laughed.The human King laughed."I was just joking. You took it seriously. Your granddaughter ... Is also old!"“……”The Supreme martial artist was speechless. F * ck you!The human King ignored him. He stood up and looked around. In the distance, there seemed to be some movement. He looked for a while and made a judgment."Tianfang and huntian might have found the New World. Li Hao's silence means that ... The New World might have reached its peak!"He turned his head and looked at the neo martial artists who were sitting cross-legged and cultivating. He shouted in a low voice,""Go! When he returned to the four-sided domain, a Great War was about to break out. The four-sided domain would be the battlefield! In this battle, the name of new martial will suppress chaos and spread the name of new martial!""Fight, fight, fight!"One by one, the neo martial cultivators instantly rose up!The human King laughed heartily,"let's go! We'll let them know who this era belongs to! Li Hao's era? The era of Emperor Yu? Wrong, neither of them! "This era still belongs to me, Fang ping!"He laughed arrogantly and said,"the older the wiser!" "I, Fang ping, have a thousand years of life. Are two mere grandchildren worthy of fighting with me? In this battle, I, new martial, will be invincible!"The group of people quickly roared in madness, their blood surging to the heavens.Neo martial, must fight!This time, we're fighting for our dignity and face. Can the cultivators of the younger generation of the two sides surpass us?The human King laughed heartily as he soared into the sky.……On this day.The land of darkness.Su Yu suddenly opened his eyes and laughed. His laughter was gentle but a little crazy."Everyone, it's time to return! Stop playing ... Time has aligned, and our era has arrived!" Behind him, laughter rang out. There was not much madness or hot blood, only ... Endless treachery and anticipation."My name, Su Yu, will resound throughout this new era!"Emperor Yu chuckled as a book appeared in his hand. He picked up his brush and wrote a line of words."This era ... I'm here!"

Chapter 3784 The Arrival Of The Third Generation_1
"It's in this area!"At this moment, huntian Supreme Emperor's eyes lit up with joy. He could feel the power of order growing stronger and stronger.In fact, it was even stronger than the order he had established.It was in this small area!He was overjoyed to see such a strong power of order. Ever since order was broken by Li Hao, he had lost the power of order. Although his strength hadn't declined much, the invasion of darkness made him very uncomfortable.His future was also greatly affected.And now, order seemed to have grown even stronger. To him, even if he couldn't seize time, as long as he could rebuild order once more, he would be able to become stronger.The Dao of chaos was stronger.The power of order was stronger."Once it's fused ..." Huntian smiled."In that case, I'll be even stronger than before. Li Hao, perhaps ... I have to thank you."Of course, the premise was that it could be taken back.At this moment, he sensed the chaos great Dao. After a few months, the chaos great Dao's fluctuations had started to calm down. The chaos great Dao's self-recovery ability was still extremely strong!At this moment, Tian Fang also seemed to have sensed something.His eyes moved slightly.Was a new world about to emerge?How far had he progressed in the Dao of time?The peak of the eighth rank?Or what?He looked in a certain direction, and his eyes flickered a little. It seemed ... To be over there.He glanced at huntian, and sure enough, huntian looked back at him. At this moment, a cold light appeared in their eyes.Huntian suddenly disappeared.The master of tianfang also disappeared in an instant. His voice reverberated with a hint of a smile,""Little friend huntian, why are you in such a hurry?"Darkness shrouded the area!It was as if huntian had walked out of the endless darkness and stepped on the chaos!At this moment, his eyes were extremely cold."Senior, your clone has stayed in the chaos for too long. I suggest ... You return first. Otherwise, if your clone dies, your main body will be affected!""Then there's no need for little friend to worry!"Supreme Emperor Tian Fang's voice resounded.At this moment, the chaos great Dao also seemed to be slightly fluctuating.Huntian Supreme Emperor's face turned cold. Instantly, a dark force burst out and swept in all directions. Space fluctuated and Tian Fang's clone appeared. He laughed,""My young friend, you're so impatient!"He had just found it, and this guy was already so impatient!"The situation inside is still unclear. Li Hao can take them away at any time. The human King and Spring Autumn are not to be trifled with. Besides, no one knows how long new heaven has been here. Huntian, you're attacking me now. If someone stronger comes out ... Even if they don 't, can you deal with the combined forces of the human King and Spring Autumn?"Huntian ignored him. Even if you can't deal with it, it's none of your business!He punched!It was as if a giant dragon had swept across the world. In all directions, the space was shaking. Tian Fang's aura was locked in. He sighed,"I'm really ... Impatient!"In an instant, the void fluctuated.It was as if a door had appeared out of thin air. Tian Fang disappeared, and when he reappeared, he was already at the edge of chaos. Spatial fluctuations came from all directions, squeezing the darkness! no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  "This clone of mine is no match for you ... However, if you act rashly again, I'll teleport this new world away. It'll take you some time to find it!"Huntian frowned slightly, but he quickly smiled.""I'm just joking with senior, there's no need for senior to be like this. "Tian Fang also laughed,'are you joking? I was just joking, don't mind me. "As the two spoke, the surrounding chaotic force seemed to be sucked dry. Gradually, an invisible world appeared. At first, it was like a small ball, but gradually, it began to expand wildly.The sound of a torrential River could be heard.The two of them were moved!He quickly dodged.At this moment, this new world seemed to be completely integrated into the chaos. It began to expand violently. In the blink of an eye, the ball expanded to an unbelievable degree. Like a Blood Moon, it illuminated the entire East!At this moment, a powerful aura began to appear.The human King, who had already returned to the East, quickly brought his men and rushed over. His aura was extremely violent, and even from far away, his voice was like thunder as he laughed,""Good show, it's starting!"In the distance, a figure that was as fast as an illusion was also shuttling over with many other figures."Time flies, chaos is merciless, and one year is full of life. I'm going to change my body again. I'm ... Tired of it!"That shadow flickered over.During this process, her old body gradually withered. The little girl gradually aged and then died.Under the original body, a small spring Autumn Cicada appeared.The chirping of cicadas rang out.It was as if everything had come back to life, and as if spring had arrived. In the chaotic void, suddenly, birds sang and flowers bloomed, as if a new world had been born. In the distance, Kong Ji took a look, and his eyes kept changing!So strong!The chirping of the spring and autumn cicadas. With one chirping of the cicadas, chaos was restored. This ... Might be the true way of restoration. On the other side.Thunder exploded, the chessboard appeared, and six divine fists broke through the air ...The Silvermoon cultivators also quickly set off into the distance."That's a world I, the Silver Moon King, created. No one can take it away from me!"All the cultivators were extremely solemn and furious.Li Hao was half-crippled, and the Silver Moon had no one to support him. Although they had made great progress in recent days, they ... Could not reverse anything in front of this group of top-notch experts.No matter what, they couldn't just sit by and watch others seize the New World that Silver Moon had created!

Moreover, Yuan Shuo's spirit was also among them.In an instant, a group of venerable sovereigns, which numbered more than 100, followed a few level 8 venerable sovereigns and flew toward the east.……At the same time.Deep in the chaos.One by one, the ninth level venerable sovereigns opened their eyes. Their stone statues had all shattered and were no longer sealing themselves. At this point, there was no need to seal themselves."The chaos great Dao has been pacified!" Someone chuckled."My true body can descend ... But it won't be able to recover to its peak, and its spirituality is insufficient.""If we really want to work together, so what if we don't have enough spirituality? Even if it's not enough, we're not weaker than huntian and the others. I'm just afraid that ... Someone is hiding their spirituality and can unleash their full power at any time to capture us all!"As soon as he said that, everyone looked at the catastrophe.Only tribulation would dare to say such words.In the past, the calamity had the best relationship with Tian Fang, but now ... Ever since the calamity's clone was killed by Li Hao, the calamity had been very dissatisfied with Tian Fang.Of course, the feeling that Tian Fang gave them ... Was that he was indeed hiding something.At this moment, Tian Fang turned his head and looked. This voice didn't sound like a calamity.Sure enough, in fact, it was not the Tribulation who had spoken. It was the venerable sovereign who had spoken with a faint smile. Only then did everyone realize that it was not him. They instantly looked towards the source of the voice.Then, they were all slightly stunned.It was him!"Life and death? are you talking about me?"Tian Fang looked at him.The life and death path master!The life and death path master's face was cold. He appeared to be very unhappy."I didn't say anything about brother tianfang. Brother tianfang, you have misunderstood. The innocent will know their place!"He had been in a bad mood recently.Among all the tier 9 experts, not to mention others, he and calamity were the unluckiest.Two avatars had died during the Tribulation, and his main body's great Dao had been cut off by the chaos. This kind of injury was not better than the death of an avatar. On the contrary, it was more severe. His life and death cycle had almost been broken."And last time ... There were so many level nine venerable sovereigns blocking chaos. They knew that chaos wanted to kill me, but they were still hiding their strength. This is the key to his misfortune.How could he not hate her?They wanted to kill these bastards.Tian Fang frowned slightly."A new world is about to appear. Your Dao of death is also within it and can still be retrieved. After so many days, even if time flows slower in this new world, it will probably take 10000 years or even more!""Your Dao of death should be even more powerful. To you, taking it back is an opportunity ... What are you dissatisfied about?"Venerable Emperor of life and death was silent for a while, and then he did not say anything.That was true."The Dao of death is a part of my great Dao. Please ... Don't think about it!""You're a master of life and death." Jie Nan chuckled."Who would take away what you love?" However ... Are you sure that your true bodies will be here today? We have so many people. If we work together, we can kill all the experts in the chaos, let alone huntian ..."Even if he wasn't at the peak, it didn't matter. I'm afraid ... That someone is going to play some tricks! If a group of tier 9 experts were all so obedient, they would not be able to become tier 9 experts.Someone chuckled,'if I don't descend, will I be trapped here forever? "Although I can't return to my peak state, I'll only have a chance if I descend. If I don't descend, I won't be able to recover my spirituality. If anyone does something in the primordial chaos, it'll be difficult to stop them .... I'm getting a little sick of these days! Let's go. Let's go down together. A million years have passed. If we continue, do we still have a chance to walk out alive?"Each and every Grade 9 had their own intentions.It was as if they were certain that someone had secretly absorbed the power of spirituality and could recover to his peak.Of course, this group of people were not to be trifled with.At this moment, their eyes met, as if they had reached an agreement. Whoever recovered to their peak ... Would be The Public Enemy!He must be killed!Unless everyone recovered together.Otherwise, even if Tian Fang wanted to recover to his peak, everyone would join forces to kill him. If one wasn't enough, then ten would do!You, Tian Fang, are strong, but if you had the confidence to kill everyone, you would have done so long ago.Why wait until today!Supreme Emperor Tian Fang didn't say anything. He knew what everyone was thinking. He just smiled and didn't say anything."Since everyone has decided ... Then ... Descend!"Tian Fang sighed."A million years is an extremely long time for us. I forgot to tell you. Today ... Is two million years of my lifespan."Everyone's hearts moved!It had been two million years!Tian Fang was two million years old.It was extremely ancient!None of the grade-9 experts present were older than Tian Fang. Even if the others weren't young, they were all inferior to Tian Fang. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  How long had chaos existed for?They didn't know.How long could a ninth-rank live normally?They didn't know.And now, Tian Fang let them know that they could still live on for at least two million years."Congratulations!""I didn't expect that a million years would pass in the blink of an eye. Two million years of life ... It's so long. A million years ago ..." Venerable Lord calamity laughed."It doesn't seem to be a happy occasion!"Tian Fang didn't seem to mind. He smiled and said,""It's just a small interlude. Let's go. ""The origin of chaos. Do I need someone to guard it?""There's no need for that. The origin itself has the power to fight back. Even chaos can't destroy it. Besides ... Who would be willing to stay?"Tian Fang shook his head.

Chapter 3786 The Arrival Of The Third Generation_3
No one would be willing to stay, unless everyone stayed.Moreover, the origin of chaos was not really without any power to fight back. Previously, long Zhan had taken a small bite and had already awakened the origin. Otherwise, chaos would not have been beaten so badly.At that time, chaos was a true rank nine."Then ... Descend! No, return ... The chaos is our territory!"Someone laughed out loud.The chaos was theirs to begin with. They had only returned, not descended.The venerable sovereigns stood up one by one, and great DAOs appeared in front of them. These great DAOs seemed to be solid and merged into their bodies at this moment. Looking at them, they were all incomparably powerful and their auras were unparalleled!  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 Tian Fang didn't say anything else. He took the lead and directly crossed over to the chaos great Dao, causing it to tremble!,m The DAOs in everyone's bodies were also shaking.Its spirituality began to weaken.After entering the primal Chaos, they found that it was extremely turbid and the spirituality was not dense enough. This was also the reason why they had hidden in the depths of the primal Chaos in the past.At this moment, it was as if the entire chaos was splitting apart.A monstrous aura appeared from the four-sided domain.That's right, the place of descent ... Was the square domain.One, two, three ...Wisps of energy rose up, and the power of great DAOs and chaotic power were instantly devoured. The entire chaotic world seemed to enter a vacuum!At this moment, countless venerable sovereigns in some worlds of the four-direction zone were trembling in fear.As for the ordinary people, they had no idea what had happened. They only felt ... Anxious!……The four sides of the chaos.Some of the major cosmos absolute beings also looked in one direction. The seventh and eighth rank venerable sovereigns, who were still alive, had complicated looks in their eyes.The venerable sovereigns from a million years ago ... Had returned!"Tian Fang, life and death, yin and yang, five elements, light and darkness, calamity, fate, prophecy, decay, darkness, Hurricane, devour ..."Some of the older venerable sovereigns seemed to have sensed something and murmured to themselves.These were all legends from their childhood.Although these Grade 9 experts from a million years ago had disappeared, they had still left behind endless legends in this chaos.And now, they had returned.Chaos was dead, but there were still many of the ninth step that were alive.Their auras were extremely powerful and devoured the void. In the blink of an eye, all the chaotic force in the four-sided domain was sucked dry by them. Their true bodies were far more powerful than their clones.It was almost like everyone could be compared to huntian.It was no longer like before, where dozens of doppelgangers were unable to match the chaos Emperor. Many of them were killed, and long Zhan could kill several.Today, their auras were turbulent, and the entire chaos seemed to be overturned! Four regions.Calamity Supreme Emperor looked in one direction. Li Hao had been there all along. At this moment, his eyes were cold and he chuckled."I don't know what's going on inside new heaven and earth. I only know that Li Hao might have a way to take back new heaven. Everyone ... This place is not far from where he is hiding. Is there anyone willing to go with me?"The reason why he called for everyone to go together was just in case. Of course, it was also to not be left behind by everyone. It would be best if everyone left together.It's not far anyway!Let's kill Li Hao first!If they killed Li Hao, huntian human King would be no match for them. In the end, they would have to fight for time, which would be the real battle between level nine beings."A new world is about to appear ..." Tian Fang frowned slightly."Brother tianfang, if Li Hao doesn't die, there will be great hidden dangers!" Calamity frowned.If he didn't die, she wouldn't be at ease.He would kill Li Hao first. Even if new world really produced an expert, he wouldn't care. After all, new world had great limitations. At this moment, it was impossible for Li Hao to reach level 9. No matter how strong he was, he would only be the next huntian at best.But Li Hao ... He was a little weak, but he had too many hidden dangers."Hualala ..."At this moment, the sound of running water suddenly reverberated through the entire chaos, as if the river was surging, as if the sky was cracking, and as if a waterfall was falling.At this moment, in the distance, in the huge red world.A door seemed to have opened.A long river began to flow out from the gate. Wherever it went, time seemed to have stopped.Outside the new Sky.Huntian frowned slightly, and the eyes of tianfang's clone also flickered. This was ... Time!Illusionary figures seemed to appear above the river. The leader was dressed in snow-white clothes and had no weapon in his hand. He only had a bright smile, and like Li Hao and the others, he seemed to like smiling very much.Behind him, powerful figures also appeared.There was the aura of death, the aura of the Dao of responsibility, the aura of the Dao of clone, the aura of all kinds of great Dao, and even the aura of the demon race and the chaos race.It was as if the entire world had become his opponent's home ground."What a good Primal Chaos!"A soft sigh and a soft laugh spread in all directions.Refined.That's right, just from his appearance and behavior, he was a refined, refined, refreshing, and kind man. At this moment, he stood on the river, as if a star was supporting him!At that moment ... Everyone was shocked!That was ... Shi Guang!Shi Guang was beneath his feet."Let me introduce myself. I'm Su Yu, the master of the myriad worlds!"His voice spread like clear spring water, and his laughter was gentle, like the little brother next door. The smile on his face spread. "I'm new here, so I don't know what the rules are. People of the myriad worlds must follow the rules and pay attention to them. If there's anything I'm not good at, please give me your guidance!"

Chapter 3787 The Arrival Of The Third Generation
The rules!As soon as these two words came out, it was as if the world solidified, the great Dao stood in great numbers, and lightning flashed.I'm Su Yu, and I value rules the most!It was random and irregular!Without rules, there would be no order. If there were no rules, the world would be unstable, and all realms would be unstable.This chaos, chaos.He was a little disgusted, as if he felt the disgust of the past when the myriad world was in chaos. He gently covered his nose and chuckled,""Who is the master of this place? A group of Dragons can not be without a leader, and the myriad worlds can not be without a master. There can not be two suns in the sky, and there can not be two emperors on earth. I invite the master of this place to explain the rules to the cultivators of the myriad worlds to avoid conflict!"The long river of time spread in all directions.The sky changed color as if the sun had descended.At this moment, even the aura of the grade 9 experts who had descended was covered up.He was clearly just a new master of the world. In the Eyes of Chaos, he was just the master of a world. There were countless worlds and world Masters in the four directions of the world, but none of them could be so calm and powerful. He had reached the peak of Dao.Intimidate everyone!He stepped on time and behind him, the Monarchs surrounded him. He looked majestic, like an Emperor inspecting the world.At this moment, a group of people walked out from behind him. At this moment, there seemed to be some changes. The eyes of some people began to change, and their intelligence seemed to be awakening.However ... No matter what he thought of, he didn't move and continued to stand behind her.The rules!The so-called universe, from top to bottom, up to the present, had always been the universe!Up and down, the four directions were the universe, and the past and present were the universe.……At the edge of the four-sided domain.A smile appeared on a person's face as he wandered in the chaotic force. 'What a man, Su Yu, the future emperor. No, now, the other party is in the same time and is no longer a future person.'But ... Now!The past had passed, and the future could not be pursued. Only the present was a living person, a real person."You've finally come out. "Li Hao murmured with a smile.What an overbearing Lord.The moment he came out of the world, he talked about rules. Since ancient times, rules ... Could only be established by the strong.Who could set rules in this chaos?……On the other side.The human King curled his lips and sneered. What an arrogant fellow.He was just a junior, yet he dared to be so arrogant!At this moment, someone's expression changed slightly. The sun god looked in that direction and was somewhat absent-minded. Other than the sun god, some people were also somewhat absent-minded. Venerable the sword looked into the distance and fell into deep thought. He looked at the people behind the man and was somewhat absent-minded. Some people ... He felt that they were familiar.But ... This group of people had all come from the future, born in a new world. He had never come into contact with them before, so why did they look so ... Familiar?He fell into deep thought. After a long time, he connected it to the situation of the sun god and seemed to ... Realize something. His heart moved.It can't be, right?The human king's mouth twitched for a moment before he looked over again. Suddenly, his eyes flickered and he frowned slightly as he glanced at the Supreme martial artist. The Supreme martial artist seemed to have expected this and nodded his head slightly when he saw the human King looking over.The human King raised his eyebrows and snorted!At this moment, he seemed to be a little dissatisfied.What a great Su Yu!So, back then ... You lied to me?Alright, I won't argue with you on the account that you saved a group of people. However, when I thought about the countless living beings in that world, I suddenly thought of something. I looked at the Supreme Being again, and the Supreme Being nodded slightly.  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 You ... Might not have guessed wrong, they are all the same person.The human King's eyes instantly changed.So that was how it was!In the next moment ... He glanced at the Grandmaster with a strange expression.Grandmaster smiled, shook his head, and transmitted,"The student has surpassed the master. I'm not that perverted. There are men and women, old and young, even each other's ... That, I can't do it. I always thought that I was ... Bored enough. In the end, I met an even more perverted one. Don't think too much about it. My clones are all me, they have never changed."I'm not that perverted.That world, that magical world, even had a normal cycle of life and death. Everyone married and had children. Couples mated with each other ...This matter wasn't just one person.If it was really one person ... Even the Supreme martial artist was somewhat speechless. Was this still a person?The clone was also him!'You ... And yourself ...Alright!He was convinced. He had never met such a freak in his life. Li Hao, the human King, and even Su Yu were all outstanding talents. They might be crazy, but ... Crazy did not mean perverted."The land of ten thousand worlds has actually cultivated such an abnormal person. I hope that he doesn't recognize me. I hope that he doesn't think that he has anything to do with me. I don't know this kind of person and I can't afford to lose face."I only left behind some clone Dao, not the perverted Dao.……At this moment, all the level nine Supreme emperors in the four-direction zone had forgotten about Li Hao.Master of tianfang slightly raised his eyebrows. Venerable sovereign calamity and the others all looked into the distance. At this moment, someone said in a low voice,"Can you tell?""Not weak ... At least not weaker than Li Hao. Li Hao only has 5000 Dao laws, which is comparable to a cultivator with 8000 Dao laws. This person ... Is at least at this level!""That's good ..."Li Hao's 5000 Dao laws were comparable to the 8000 Dao laws of an Ordinary Level 8. He was considered a top-tier existence among level 8.From the looks of it, this person's aura was no weaker than Li Hao's back then. Moreover, by stepping on the stars of time, he might have also mastered the power of time and become a third-generation time demon. He could be considered a true third-generation time demon, and a replica of Li Hao.

Chapter 3788 The Arrival Of The Third Generation
It was still alright!This thought appeared in everyone's mind. Li Hao was difficult to deal with, but what was difficult about him was his brain, his madness, and his extremely cold-bloodedness.If this person was just a second Li Hao ... No one would be afraid.Of course, compared to Li Hao, everyone frowned slightly. They looked at the people behind Li Hao and found it unbelievable. There seemed to be many level eight venerable sovereigns.Although they were not as good as Su Yu, at a glance, there were at least ten level eight venerable sovereigns.This was somewhat unexpected!A small new world had given birth to a peak tier 8, and there were so many new tier 8 emperors ... Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  But on second thought, it was normal.How many level eight venerable sovereigns had died last time?A lot of them!After so many rank eight venerable sovereigns had died, many of them had integrated into the new world. It seemed normal for so many experts to be born."Let's go and take a look!""Then Li Hao ..." "The third generation is out. It seems that Li Hao has really given up. We can kill him at any time. Let's not worry about this tribulation!"When Su Yu walked out, he stepped on time, surrounded by a long river, and strong people were like a forest.At this moment, instead of looking for Su Yu, he had to look for Li Hao ... Was he too bored?You have nothing to do?Without time, Li Hao was nothing. He was only as strong as a random level-eight cultivator behind Su Yu, so why would he go out of his way to kill him?The Tribulation was somewhat dissatisfied!However, at this moment, it was true that this new Lord of the myriad worlds was more troublesome.He didn't say anything more and quickly followed the others, running into the distance!……At the same time.Huntian Supreme Emperor's expression changed. He could feel the power of order. It was actually ... Scattered throughout the entire River. It was as if no one cultivated order on their own. Instead, order ... Had completely turned into rules, into rules, and integrated into the entire River.The foundation of the river seemed to be built by order.He frowned slightly.This is troublesome!If the path of order was cultivated by one person, he could just kill that person and take it back.But now ... It seemed like a group of people were sharing the order.This instantly gave him a headache!"No wonder I felt order becoming stronger. Everyone seems to be cultivating order, so it naturally made order stronger. He looked at the crowd above the river and said in a deep voice,""I am huntian ...""Are you the master of chaos here?"Su Yu smiled humbly."Oh, it's Chaos Emperor. I'm sorry for being impolite!"His voice reverberated, and his laughter was hearty."I'm new here. I've troubled the Emperor to welcome me personally. You're too polite!"Huntian frowned slightly, but he quickly regained his calm.""We all know the day your myriad world will be created! There are some things that you may not know. That day, Li Hao slaughtered countless creatures and created the world of ten thousand worlds. He took one of my ultimate treasures, named the heavenly policy of order. This time, I'm here to take it back! That Li Hao, a chaos demon, has killed countless people ...""Li Hao? The time King?"Su Yu seemed to have come to a realization."He ... Is a demon?""It's a devil!"Huntian nodded. At this moment, he was trying to speak nicely because he felt that ... These people in front of him were not weak. Moreover, they were orderly and seemed ... To follow the rules. If he could successfully retrieve the order heavenly policy ... It would naturally be the best.Let's get back the heavenly order scroll first."Everyone has the right to kill a devil!"Su Yu nodded slightly."Pingsheng hates people who kill the innocent the most. The myriad world has been in turmoil for many years, and countless people have been killed or injured. The demonic path is rampant. There are also some legends about this master of time in our myriad world. I thought he was a man of the righteous path, but who would have thought that he was actually a demonic ... What a pity.""I've never seen the so-called heavenly policy of order," he said with a smile."May I know ... What is it?""The Dao of order is integrated into the river. I've observed your DAOs. Everyone has some Dao of rules ... If we can extract some, we can definitely condense the heavenly policy of order ..." Huntian said.Su Yu's expression changed slightly."This ... I seem to understand a little. But this is the origin of the rules of our myriad worlds. If it is extracted, the rules of the myriad worlds will no longer exist ..."He seemed to be a little surprised and had a headache.He looked at the people behind him and said with a depressed look,""The rules of the myriad world ... Seems to be transformed from the so-called heavenly policy of order that this senior mentioned. The master of time is truly the number one evildoer in the world. Snatching people's treasures just for his own selfish gains, truly despicable!""Detestable!""He's indeed detestable!""You can't steal or snatch other people's things!""The path of our myriad worlds does not leave behind anything. It was actually opened by this person?"“……”All of the cultivators were somewhat dissatisfied.At this moment, Su Yu took out a book. When the others saw this, many of them took out a book and looked at it. Huntian was stunned. In the distance, the tianfang clone's eyes also flickered.A group of ... Scholars?How interesting!The book seemed to be filled with laws, and the great Dao seemed to form a forest.Su Yu looked at huntian and sighed,""As scholars, we have always followed the rules. The time King actually stole someone's treasure and opened up a long river. This move is seriously inconsistent with our ideals! A demon should be killed by everyone ... Since it's senior's treasure, I should return it to senior!"Then, he sighed."Although it will weaken us a little and break some rules of the myriad realms ... Everyone, you must remember that we can't take things that have an owner and the property of others. Taking it is stealing!"

Chapter 3789 The Arrival Of The Third Generation_6
"Everyone, strip the rules, condense them into a book, return them to the seniors, and build another heavenly policy of order ...""Emperor Yu, the stripping of the regulations will shake the myriad world. You can't ..."Some of the old officials seemed to be unwilling. Emperor Yu shouted,""We cultivators study and write, how can we steal other people's property? This action goes against my heart. Unless senior gives me a treasure, how can I take it without asking?"Some people looked at huntian as if they were begging,"why don't you give it to us?"At this moment, huntian felt a little uncomfortable.For a moment ... He was not used to it.He was only saying it, this Emperor Yu ... Was he really going to return it to him?He didn't expect it to be so simple. At this moment, he suspected that there was a trap and didn't say anything.As for Emperor Yu, he didn't say much. From his own book, he gradually extracted two words and turned them into order!In just an instant, the long river shook.The power of order emerged from the other books. Gradually, a book began to form in the air. At this moment, a group of people rushed over from the distance."You can 't!" Someone shouted.Everyone was going crazy!There's such an idiot?How was that possible?He ... Really gave it to her?They had thought that Su Yu was just saying it casually. Who knew that he was really stripping away the rule force in their long river? was he crazy?Or did he become stupid from studying?However, how could a person who had become a fool from studying become the master of the myriad worlds?They were in a daze!Moreover, if this person was the one who had resisted the lightning tribulation that day, he didn't look like a fool!What was going on?Su Yu frowned slightly and said softly,""What are those?""Forget it, Chaos Emperor. You have to pay attention to the rules. You are the Emperor of this place. How can you let others interrupt our conversation? There's no order without rules!"Emperor Yu then continued,"the chaotic energy in your body is a little dense. It's probably caused by the dissipation of the laws. The people of the myriad world are willing to live in peace with the chaotic energy. We can not allow an Emperor to be in chaos!""I'm not a pedantic person. I'll return order to you, establish rules, and chaos and peace. Otherwise, chaos will reign, and the country will be no country, with demons emerging!"After he said that, a new book appeared in his hand.Order!The two words swayed and glowed, as if the order and rules of heaven and earth were contained in these two words.He slowly sent the book out and flew towards huntian with a sincere expression.""Senior Emperor, please accept this item. It might not be the same as the original one. After all, we don't know what the heavenly policy of order originally looked like. I hope that senior can absorb the rules and improve the order. A country without a ruler will fall into chaos, and chaos without a ruler will perish!"Huntian was stunned!Yes, he was stunned.At this moment, a book was flying towards him. He was on high alert. This ... Was too easy. Really, too easy. He couldn't believe it. He even felt a little uneasy.How was that possible?These people were not weak. Even though Emperor Yu was not as strong as him, he was not weaker than Li Hao. He could be considered a top-notch expert.I was just saying!In the end ...He could feel the extremely powerful power of order. It was a powerful rule force that seemed to have been perfected, filled, repaired, and established by generations of cultivators!At this moment, it was filling the book.If ... He devoured it and fused it with the powerful chaotic Darkness Energy in his body, perhaps ... He could instantly reach the ninth step!It was an incredible feeling!Everything was like a dream. It was so unreal. He hesitated and did not dare to take it easily, but he still reached out his hand. The power of the great path spread out and went straight to the book. He kept staring at Su Yu, who seemed to be very sincere and just looked at it silently.In the distance, Tian Fang's clone was also shocked.Really?艹!In the next moment, he flashed and charged over. This wouldn't do!The chaos energy in huntian's body was already much stronger. If he truly absorbed the power of laws, the balance between chaos and order would be reached. He might even be able to instantly reach level 9 and even surpass the level 9 experts that had descended today.What a joke!Everyone had been waiting for three generations. Some people felt that even if he wasn't as crazy as Li Hao, he definitely wasn't simple. After all, few people who could rise in a new world were simple.What was the situation now?Just as Tian Fang's clone was about to flash over, Su Yu's eyes suddenly changed, and he shouted,""How audacious!""There's actually someone who dares to attempt an assassination in the diplomatic relations between the two worlds. Bastard!"He was furious.The experts behind him were also enraged."Kill the assassin!" In an instant, the power of dozens of great DAOs surged out and charged toward the sky. The sky changed color and pierced through the void, but the civilization manual in Emperor Yu's hand seemed to tremble.The void instantly froze!The space seemed to be frozen.[From top to bottom, from ancient times until now, wherever I go, it's my earth!]In an instant, the space was frozen.BOOM!The space trembled and exploded. The tianfang clone was in a sorry state. It was unbelievable. The Dao of space!This person knew the way of space!How could this be?His expression changed slightly. Li Hao didn't grasp the way of space when he opened the sky, so why did this person know it?Li Hao only had 5000 Dao laws, so he couldn't form a space. This wasn't right ...His expression changed again and again.In the distance, Tian Fang's original body also rushed over with his people. His heart moved. Space!Suddenly, he turned his head to look at a chessboard in the distance and frowned slightly. Was it the residual spatial power of the Dao chess pieces that had been integrated into it, thus ... Perfecting the spatial great Dao of the New World?He instantly frowned.This was not good news.At that moment, huntian took the Book of Order into his hands and was ecstatic!Even if Tian Fang tried to stop him, it would be useless. He didn't even make a move, and the other party actually managed to stop him.As for him, he quickly sensed it. It was indeed the way of order, but ... It was a little different from before. It was indeed the power of order. He was overjoyed, but ... He was still a little nervous. Can I ... Absorb it?He was a little worried. It had come too easily!All of a sudden ... He actually hesitated."Huntian must be plotting something!""It's not that easy to give it to you! Don't absorb it! Otherwise, you'll die!" A rank nine venerable sovereign shouted from afar.At this moment, everyone was cursing in their hearts!F * ck, there better be a problem.It would be best if huntian was so scared that he did not dare to absorb it!Otherwise, huntian Zhen would instantly become a true rank-9 before the three generations of time could be resolved. That would be troublesome.This guy couldn't have given them the real heavenly policy of order to make them kill each other, right?If that was the case ... They would all be depressed to death.Should he learn from Li Hao and throw time into chaos, making them kill each other?They had already experienced it once, so they would not be fooled again!……At this moment, huntian was nervous, excited, and happy ...He ... Thought it was true!Perhaps, like Li Hao, the other party wanted him to be the second chaos. However, this person had just arrived and had no idea that this was not time. What the rank-9 wanted was time, not order!Even if he really did become a tier 9 and obtained order, Tian Fang and the others would not risk their lives to fight him.If that's what he's thinking ... He's wrong. What everyone wants is your Dao of time!Carefully, he absorbed some power of order and fused it into his body. He was overjoyed ... It was true, and there didn't seem to be any problems.In the next moment, huntian began to absorb the power of order.Su Yu sighed,"why are there so many unruly people ..."He looked around helplessly.In truth ...
