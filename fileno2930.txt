They didn't even have a chance to show off.He had wanted to take this opportunity to do something, but the myriad DAOs sect was too useless. Of course, it was also because the venerable sovereigns in the Crimson Moon world were too powerful. The power of the Crimson Moon was too powerful. Once it appeared, even venerable sovereigns would be controlled.And within the Dao universe, sector Lord Sen LAN shook his head.Boring!With this, it would be difficult to determine the true strength of the Son of God of light and the Silvermoon King. It would also be difficult to find out where the venerable sword was hiding.What a pity!In fact, he still wanted to test it out. At least, he had to know what he was doing.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Two rank five venerable sovereigns appeared, both with a happy expression.Jing po reached out to grab Li Hao, and the power of the Crimson Moon overflowed with the power of soul Absorption. Tan Sheng, on the other hand, grabbed the other venerable sovereigns and wiped them out.At this moment, a sword appeared!The flames soared!"Are you surprised?" he sneered."I know you won't be so easily controlled. Your Dao domain hasn't appeared yet.""How about letting me try my Dao domain?"He had a smile on his face. I'm waiting for you!If a sword's Dao domain can suppress me, then it's not a rank seven venerable sovereign, but a rank eight."As you wish!"Li Hao shouted in a low voice, and his Dao domain appeared. This time, the fire elemental domain appeared, and it seemed to be more powerful than before. Li Hao had perfected the fire elemental world a lot. When he split the world, he had also perfected it.The Dao domain appeared like a ferocious Tiger that pounced at the soul!"Ha!""Die!" A fierce shout emerged as the power of the soul-shaking great Dao was revealed. The soul-shaking power was revealed once again, and even the Tiger was somewhat intimidated!But the next moment, the Tiger roared.With intense killing intent, the flames exploded and pressed down.BOOM!The great Dao collided, and a loud sound resounded through the world.Jing po was slightly surprised. 'It's quite strong. As expected of a tier 7 inheritance. Quite capable ...'But it doesn't matter, Tan Sheng will be able to deal with the others soon. I hope I can kill this guy before he deals with the others, otherwise, Tan Sheng will laugh at me.Such a thought had just appeared.On the side, sovereign Tan Sheng, who was attacking, suddenly froze.At this moment, Kong Ji, who had been calm all this time, suddenly made his move. It was not the Nirvana world or the power of light, but a wave of death energy. The extremely dense death energy exploded in an instant!The aura of death instantly covered the entire world!A powerful aura shook the entire world.The void seemed to have turned into hell!The aura of death wrapped around Tan Sheng in the blink of an eye. Countless auras of death surged into his body, and tan Sheng's Dao of the Crimson Moon seemed to be covered in that instant. Nirvana was like a Messenger of hell, like a god from hell."He's afraid of death," he murmured softly."He deserves to be punished!"The aura of death filled the air, and in the blink of an eye, greed's life force was rapidly drained. His body withered, and in the blink of an eye, he turned into an undead-like existence.Dao marks were directly displayed. Kong Ji wasn't surprised at all ... These people were too arrogant. A Tier 5 wanted to kill a Tier 6, and they were so close to him that they were directly covered by his death energy. If they didn't die, they would be letting themselves down.In the blink of an eye, the scar of the red moon that appeared was also covered by the aura of death. Tan Sheng's voice was trembling,""Rank 6!"That was impossible!Where did the sixth rank come from?"Rank 6!""Stop!"At this moment, some people shouted in anger, while others were shocked.Shi hun was the one who shouted in anger, while the other venerable sovereigns were shocked. A rank six venerable sovereign had actually appeared. There was a rank six venerable sovereign under the command of the myriad Dao sovereign ... No, perhaps this rank six was the leader!A death-type venerable sovereign!It was too late.Just as Shi hun roared and quickly broke through the air, Tan Sheng's Red Moon mark began to decay inch by inch. Tan Sheng's Phantom image appeared with some fear and horror, and countless thoughts appeared in his mind.Surrender!At this moment, the greed for life began to bite back at him. He was used to making others afraid of death. When it came to his side, it was the same. There had never been a moment when he had such fear and terror.I don't want to die! Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  But ... Would the silence pay attention to him?Naturally, he would not.Death appeared. He walked among the death with ease. His long robe fluttered in the wind as if the real death god had descended to the world. Lin Hongyu, who had just opened her eyes, was shocked.The power of death!She also controlled life and death, but in this moment, facing this man, she suddenly felt that her power of death was just a drop in the ocean.The difference was too great!The pure power of death directly covered the Crimson Moon bedsheet, and in the blink of an eye, the Crimson Moon bedsheet shattered.He gently pointed his finger out!Kachaa!A Red Moon ... No, a Black Moon filled with the power of death was instantly shattered at this moment!Greed died with infinite fear.A powerful rank five venerable sovereign was killed by Kong Ji in an instant.p At the side, the crowd turned pale with fright!Sixth rank?How could this be!Where did the sixth rank come from?At the same time, with greed's death, a great path universe seemed to be about to forcibly descend into the world.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the universe of the great path.The expression of the Senlan realm Lord changed. In the next instant, he hollered. The great Dao universe trembled as the energy of ten thousand DAOs gathered. His voice was like a huge Bell that rang out,"Red Moon sovereign, please calm down! This is the Senlan realm. In this realm, a rank six death venerable sovereign killed a rank five venerable sovereign. There is no need for Red Moon venerable sovereign to save me. I, Senlan, can deal with a rank six death venerable sovereign!""Thank you for your help, Red Moon realmlord ... However, I still have the power to fight back!"

Chapter 2931 Heavy Losses (3)
His expression was heavy, but his voice reverberated.He didn't mention that the one who died was the venerable sovereign of Red Moon ... Although everyone knew it, so what?At this moment, he was using the Alliance to tell the other party not to forcibly descend upon the great path universe. Otherwise ... It would be a life-and-death struggle, even if the net couldn't be broken.He's just a sixth rank venerable sovereign, not a seventh rank one. What are you doing here?At this moment, outside the forest world, the power of the Crimson Moon fluctuated, and the voice of the great Dao reverberated. It was somewhat cold.""Sector Lord Sen LAN, if I can't defend against the danger, as an ally, Hong Yue will come to my aid at any time! There's no need to be polite with me. As long as you ask ... Hongyue still has the ability to kill some of the rascals!"Then, the sound of the great Dao reverberated again,""Although sector Lord Sen LAN is strong, if there really is a Type 7 realm here ... I'm worried that you guys won't be able to stop them. Call me at any time!"Sector Lord Sen Lan's voice resounded,"Thank you for your concern, Red Moon sector Lord! At the necessary moment, I, Senlan, will ask for help. Now that Xinwu's whereabouts are uncertain, I don't dare to let the venerable sovereigns take action, in case Xinwu takes advantage of the opportunity!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe power of the Crimson Moon rumbled and swept across the world!However, there was no more sound of the great Dao.Red Moon Lord was furious, but he still chose not to attack. Sector Lord Sen Lan's words made him recover from his anger. New martial!Damn it!If he wasn't afraid of a direct attack from neo martial, he wouldn't have been threatened by this guy.In the forest great Dao universe.Sector Lord Sen LAN waited for the power of the Crimson Moon to subside before heaving a sigh of relief. Beads of sweat could be seen on his face. He was a peak rank 6 venerable sovereign, but at this moment, he was extremely nervous.The red moon master had gone crazy because of his repeated failures. He wanted to come here by force!If it wasn't for the deterrent force of neo martial ... Maybe this guy would really come.It was only now that he had the time to continue observing the battle.He was stunned again.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.As Kong Ji killed Tan Sheng, Li Hao's fire element domain erupted, and the roar of a Tiger resounded through the world.Just as they were about to flee, they suddenly saw a shocking scene.Outside the fire element domain, another domain-like existence suddenly appeared, water element! Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Fire and water blended!In an instant ... BOOM!As the two different great DAOs collided, the two regions suddenly collapsed. The power of the great DAOs rumbled and directly exploded. The powerful explosive force caused even a Tier 5 Jing po to be instantly blasted into pieces.Water and fire!They were shocked. These ten thousand DAOs were fire and water dual extreme venerable sovereigns, not just a pure fire element venerable sovereign!The two extreme emperors were powerful to begin with.In addition, the sudden collision and explosion of the domains had caused him to be severely injured."Thearch of water and fire!"  "Two extreme Emperor ..."Gasps of shock rang out in the surroundings once again. No wonder this guy was so strong. He was not a pure fire element cultivator.Before the sound of horror could dissipate, a long sword appeared. Water and fire mixed together, and the sword slashed down!BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the clouds. The heavens and earth trembled instantly. A scream was heard as his body was torn apart. The power of the fusion of water and fire erupted. With a loud boom, a Red Moon quickly escaped into the sky, trying to escape!With his physical body destroyed, Jing po only wanted to escape.However, just as his Dao marks appeared and the red moon disappeared, his will suddenly trembled. Fear, endless fear, a fear that came from an unknown source, emerged from his heart.It wasn't just fear, it was also fear, loss of soul, and fear of death ...At this moment, he seemed to have sensed the Dao source of the Crimson Moon ... As if he had experienced countless emotions, he was in a trance. In this trance, a weak aura of death spread over ...He thought it was Kong Ji who had made a move, and was even more shocked!The next moment, he came back to his senses and realized that he seemed ... A little weaker.Just as this thought surfaced in his mind, a huge sword array descended from the sky, turning the world upside down. He, who had already fled a distance away, suddenly realized that he had returned to his original spot. It was not time, but the sword array that turned the world upside down!Great fear!BOOM!It just so happened to collide with Li Hao's second sword, the Sword of Water and fire.Boom ... The Crimson lunar mark exploded!Li Hao reached out his hand, and the power of countless great DAOs was swept away.On the other side, Kong Ji had also finished cleaning up the mess. He looked at the crowd with a slightly strange expression.Gan Wuliang used the power of emotion to affect the shock of his physical body disappearing. Lin Hongyu used the power of death to interfere. Hong Yitang used the heaven and earth overturning sword to reverse the direction of his opponent. Black Panther also made his move. He swallowed the void and pulled his opponent back.Coincidentally, he bumped into Li Hao's sword.It could be said that their cooperation was extremely tacit.In just an instant, a fifth level venerable sovereign was killed by this group of people.It was much faster than he had imagined.Kong Ji had thought that he would need to do something ...In the end, he didn 't.He had only taken some spoils of war, and this Jing po had been killed.The two tier 5 players did not even last ten seconds.Behind him, the Soul Eater that was about to charge over suddenly stopped.He didn't continue to chase!His face was ashen and he was shocked.He could understand why a rank six death Emperor could kill a rank five. Tan Sheng was too close to his opponent in an instant, but ... But the myriad DAOs Emperor, with his weak subordinates, was able to kill a rank five death Emperor in an instant even though his fire and water powers were strong.

Chapter 2932 Heavy Losses (3)
This ... Was unbelievable!His expression changed.One was a rank six venerable Emperor of death, and the other was a rank four venerable Emperor who could kill a rank five ...If he chased after them, he might just be sending himself to death.How was that possible?How did this happen?He was only a fourth-rank venerable sovereign with a group of low-rank venerable sovereigns, but two fifth-rank venerable sovereigns from a great world could not even last three rounds!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"This is crazy!"The group of venerable sovereigns on the wandering cultivators 'side were stunned.Yu Xiu's expression kept changing. 'They killed a fifth-rank sixth-rank venerable sovereign of death in an instant, a fourth-rank venerable sovereign of fire and water, and a low-level venerable sovereign who dared to attack a fifth-rank venerable sovereign ... Who are these people?'So strong!Even if he was a Grade 6, at this moment, his heart was still shaking.This was a level five in the great world!In the end, he was also killed instantly. Even if he had underestimated the other party ... He died too quickly. The key was that the Crimson Moon world had not descended. He had actually sensed something, but he had also discovered the fluctuations of the forest great Dao universe.It was obvious that sector Lord Sen LAN was still the same. He didn't allow the Crimson Moon universe to descend. As for why Crimson Moon master didn't forcefully descend, the threat of the new martial was still there. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  This time, Red Moon suffered a big loss.Two tier 5 experts were dead!The moment they had this thought, Li Hao shouted,""Kill him!"He and Kong Ji instantly charged towards the soul erosion!Soul Emperor's face changed. Bastard!Even though he felt that he might not be afraid of them ... At this moment, he still chose to turn around and escape.At the same time.The expressions of the experts from the three worlds and the six venerable sovereigns changed. They wanted to attack, and perhaps this was their chance. Just as they were about to attack, the void fluctuated, and venerable sovereign Yan Fang appeared. He didn't say anything, but just looked at them coldly.The venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed.Was Senlan ... Going to help them?"Yan Fang ...""Do you all want to participate in this?" Thearch Yan Fang asked coldly. I've come to an agreement with those people ... They can kill the ten thousand DAOs, but they are them, and you are you!"A fourth level venerable sovereign said with a serious expression,""These people aren't simple. Yan Fang sovereign, fire water dual extreme sovereign, death sovereign ... Where did they come from? These DAOs are not ordinary DAOs. This group of people ... Have a problem with their origins!""Is that so?"Yan Fang laughed,"it has nothing to do with me, Senlan. They ... Are no longer employed by Senlan. Right now, I'm here to tell you that this is Senlan's territory. You, are not Crimson Moon. You are not allowed to walk around Senlan as you please!"‚Äã It was that simple!He didn't even try to hide his voice. His voice spread in all directions. Li Hao and his group had been fired and no longer employed by them. It had nothing to do with them. However, they were now exercising the power and responsibility of Supreme Emperor Sen LAN.This is our territory!You guys are not allowed to move around. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the side of the wandering cultivators, Yu Xiu didn't say anything.His expression was a little heavy.Sen LAN was about to take action.More importantly, even a fool could tell that the myriad DAOs Academy had an extraordinary background. Perhaps they had the support of a powerful faction behind the scenes. Otherwise, how could a sixth stage nameless sovereign of death appear out of nowhere?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At that moment, some venerable sovereigns who were hiding in the dark also changed their expressions.Two more Red Moon venerable sovereigns had died!From start to finish, the number of venerable sovereigns that Hong Yue had killed in Senlan could be counted on two hands. Including the three wandering cultivator brothers, there were exactly 10 venerable sovereigns who had died.The eroding soul was escaping!His expression was a little unsightly.The two people behind him were extremely fast, and the rank six death Emperor was even faster than him. If this continued, he would be caught up to, and that bastard Yan Fang was intimidating everyone!Just as he was thinking, his expression suddenly changed.At that moment, a powerful great Dao power rushed toward Kong Ji like a Red Moon. Kong Ji's expression changed. Without saying anything, the power of death exploded. It was as if a god of death had appeared in the sky!It collided with the Crimson Moon, and with a loud boom, the two forces exploded.BOOM!An explosion sounded out and a shadow appeared, looking coldly at the escaping Shi hun, he shouted,"Come back!"The soul devouring Emperor was shocked, but he was overjoyed in the next moment.Venerable sovereign Wu Shang!This was also a sixth level venerable sovereign from Red Moon. He knew that the other party was hiding in the forest orchid, but he did not expect him to come out ... The next moment, he secretly complained. This was troublesome. Wushang was originally hidden, but he had appeared for him.He couldn't care about this anymore. At this moment, he could only atone for his crimes by doing good deeds!Cooperate with Wushang and kill these people.He quickly returned!Meanwhile, Kong Ji sent a voice transmission to Li Hao."He's not weak ... I might have to use the life and death extremes. Otherwise, he won't be much of a threat!"Li Hao nodded and sent a voice transmission, I'll try to combine the five elements! Although we might not be able to fight against a Tier 6 expert, we can at least provide you with some help. As long as we can defeat them and make them unable to deal with us, two of you will not be enough. Even if another Tier 6 expert comes, they will not be able to kill us ... Then at least two of you will come, and we will meet our expectations!""You know how to combine the five elements?"Kong Ji was surprised.Li Hao was too lazy to respond.I've been cultivating the five elements since the beginning, did you know that?However, among the five elements, the other three elements, earth, metal, and wood, were much weaker. The five elements combined into one, so the increase was not that great.At this moment, the two of them still had time to chat.The two red Moon sixth rank venerable sovereigns also quickly gathered.Venerable Emperor Wushang, who had just appeared, didn't berate him directly. He only transmitted a message secretly."Shi hun, if you and I can't take them down ... This time, we will lose our chance to advance to the 7th step! You bastard, who told you to split up?"

2933 Chapter 482
There was suffering for devouring the soul!How would I have known that there was a rank six hidden among them? how would I have known that the myriad DAOs was venerable sovereign of water and fire? it was clearly you bastards who sent back the wrong information!In addition, everyone was on guard against the seventh rank venerable sovereign behind the myriad DAOs sect. Therefore, the Crimson Moon world had been monitoring Sen Lan's surroundings to prevent the arrival of the seventh rank venerable sovereign.However ... Who knew that there was a top tier sixth-rank among them?You blame me, but I haven't blamed you yet!"Wushang, now's not the time to talk about this ... We have to take them down. Otherwise, we'll be in big trouble. Now that we've lost, we won't be laughed at by outsiders. We'll be laughed at by those bastards!"Many sixth level venerable sovereigns were waiting.If he and Wushang failed, those people would laugh to death."Let's join forces and kill them!"Wushang didn't say much. He had to show himself. Otherwise, if devouring soul was really killed, it would be useless for him to hide. If he didn't do anything after seeing so many Red Moon sovereign being killed, he would be targeted by his enemies in the realm.The two of them quickly took action!The power of the great Dao emerged, and the whole world seemed to be shrouded by the Crimson Moon. The Crimson Moon's great Dao seemed to only have one type, which was the power of desire, but in fact, it was divided into many types.At this moment, the power of the great Dao of the soul-devouring monarch was so strong that it seemed to be able to corrode the world, the great Dao, and the soul.As for Emperor Wushang, the power of his great Dao was also extremely powerful. A sense of grief appeared in Li Hao and Kong Ji's hearts.The two venerable sovereigns were not weak."Die!" Kong Ji shouted. Death appeared, and the next moment, a strong life force exploded. Everyone in the realm felt like their life force was being sucked away!Wushang was shocked!"Life and death!"He was also a dual polarity heavenly Emperor.Was it that easy to form two poles?BOOM!The explosion of life and death tore the world apart. The two venerable sovereigns 'Dao of the red moon instantly trembled. At the same time, the power of the five elements emerged. Li Hao's sword attack shook the five elements, but at this moment, he was not too surprised.After learning water and fire, it wasn't strange for him to learn the other three elements. Furthermore, the other three elements weren't too powerful. It could only be said that this ten thousand DAOs was stronger than expected. As for the five elements, water and fire were the most difficult to combine. The other elements weren't that scary.However, Kong Ji's explosive strength still made the two of them feel immense pressure.Although Li Hao's sword intent was strong, it was still acceptable."We're in trouble ... Wushang, he's the life and death Emperor. I'm afraid we can't take him down!"The Soul Eater was extremely depressed! The two of them might not be able to defeat them, but ... If that was the case, the mission would be a complete failure. If they couldn't take down the two of them, they wouldn't be able to explain themselves.At this moment, Wushang also cursed. The next moment, he roared,""These two people are new martial artists! Yu Xiu, you all come quickly to help the battle and take down the new martial arts sinner!"In the distance, the Rogue cultivator Yu Xiu cursed.F * ck!You're asking me to make a move at this time?They were not blind. These two probably couldn't take down these people. They could only ask others to help them. They were not willing to let Red Moon send more people. Otherwise ... Even if the position of the sixth-rank was not low, if these two failed this time, Red Moon would have a seventh-rank quota. These two would definitely not have a share!Should he make a move?Yu Xiu was still thinking. Just as he was thinking, in the distance, Yan Fang softly said,""Don't talk nonsense! I can't guarantee the identity of Wan Dao and the others ... But, without concrete evidence, no one can accuse me! If I can confirm that they are the sin of the new martial artists, I, Sen LAN, will be the first to kill them! The Dao master of our realm died in the hands of the neo martial human King, and we can't live under the same sky as them! Wushang, if you put it this way ... Wouldn't I, Senlan, be unable to stand in the chaos?"He said in a cold voice,""I, Senlan, am willing to provide the venue for your battle. I've already done my best. If you dare to accuse me again ... Are all the venerable sovereigns of Senlan dead?"BOOM!Powerful auras instantly erupted.There were also many venerable sovereigns Sen LAN.At this moment, regardless of whether it was the branch of the world Lord or the branch of the Dao Lord ... All of them erupted with auras that shook the surroundings.Even if the Dao Lord's lineage was unwilling, they couldn't show it now. The world Overlord was still around.Moreover ... The neo martial that Yan Fang mentioned was the enemy who killed the Dao master. If they did not make their stand clear now, the Dao master's line would not be able to stand on their own. They and neo martial were absolutely irreconcilable!As the auras of these venerable sovereigns erupted, the entire great world became turbulent. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  On the contrary, Yu Xiu and the other rogue cultivators heaved a sigh of relief.It's not that we don't want to give Hong Yue face, but ... Senlan has intervened, so it's not good for us to intervene.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Both Wushang and eroding soul were extremely furious!"Yan Fang!"Wushang's voice was cold. This move was no different from cutting off their path to tier 7. This was a life-and-death feud. Was this Yan Fang looking for death?To deter others and prevent others from interfering, what else could they do but ask for help from the red moon?The moment he sought help, he would fail the mission. The failure would not be qualified to reach the seventh step!Yan Fang didn't back down an inch. At this moment, he displayed the demeanor of an expert and said in an extremely cold voice,""This is the Senlan! Senlan was weak, but it had many allies behind it, such as Hong Yue, Tian Lan, Cang Jiang, and Yue Ming. Did these itinerant cultivators really think that there was no one in the four worlds to disturb Senlan? Don't force me, the Senlan realmlord, to personally act and kill all of you. Even if there are many rogue cultivators, can they fight against the Senlan monarchs? Can he fight against an advanced venerable sovereign of the four worlds?"

2934 Chapter 482
In an instant, the world fell silent!Many people held their breaths and didn't say a word.These words ... In front of Red Moon Emperor, saying that Senlan had Red Moon behind her ... What a joke.But the truth was as such.Wushang and soul Eater were both furious!Bastard!If the other party really went to ask for help from the red moon, that would be for the best. The red moon Lord would come directly. The key point was that Yan Fang was obviously just a disgusting person and would not ask for help from the red moon at all.He was just saying it!The two of them would not pose much of a threat to them at all.The two of them were still in a rage when a loud boom rang out. Kong Ji's life and death combined as one. A star directly smashed through the heavens and earth. The two red moons shook non-stop. Kong Ji seemed to be somewhat angered!Two bastards, how dare you get distracted while fighting us!You're looking for death!With a loud bang, the power of great DAOs surged out like it was free, directly forcing the two of them to retreat!The two of them were overjoyed!Didn't this guy know that this was Senlan?In this place, it was difficult to recover the power of a great Dao once it was consumed, but it actually erupted so unscrupulously ...They still wanted to waste some time!In the end, Kong Ji's speed of recovery was frighteningly fast, and he was almost always at his peak. In addition, Li Hao and the other venerable sovereigns were constantly harassing them ...After the battle, the two sixth level venerable sovereigns had to escape with some injuries!That life and death Emperor, damn it, made them unable to even curse.The power of the great DAOs seemed to be endless!They didn't know what was going on, but they could guess that it was the combination of life and death, which caused the other party to consume very little energy and recover very quickly ... If they continued fighting, they would be the ones who would be exhausted!In fact, Kong Ji had secretly used a revival technique.Just as they had guessed, it consumed little energy and recovered quickly. Unless an expert could kill him instantly, Kong Ji was not afraid of anyone in terms of energy consumption.As the two rank six venerable sovereigns fled, the entire world fell silent.Li Hao's voice resounded in all directions,"if you want to kill us, you'll have to pay the price!" Today, I'll kill two tier 5 cultivators to let you know that I'm not to be trifled with. Fellow Daoist death and I don't have any intention of targeting anyone ... We've come to Senlan to earn some cultivation resources, so why must you all be so ruthless?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThere was no sound.Go to hell!Are you guys really just trying to make money?What a joke!How dare you kill so many venerable sovereigns of the red moon?A Tier 6, yet unknown, had popped out of nowhere. Only a great world had such a Foundation. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At that moment, the two sixth stage venerable sovereigns who had escaped from the crack looked terrible.Shi hun was a little helpless and depressed, he sighed,""We can't kill them even if we join forces ..." This is troublesome!Wushang's face was gloomy. He looked at him and said coldly,""You really deserve to die!"Eroding soul was also a little angry,'your information is inaccurate! "The information you sent back was that there was only one person who had just advanced to the 4th rank. Do you think you can throw the responsibility to me? A rank six life and death Emperor suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Wushang, strictly speaking, I'm afraid that my responsibility is not greater!"You want to push the responsibility to me? dream on!Wushang was furious but also helpless.This was the truth.Inaccurate information ... This was also a big problem.'Damn it!'He took a deep breath."It's useless for us to have an internal conflict. Now, only by killing this group of people can we atone for our crimes!" He said. A sixth rank venerable sovereign of life and death, a fourth rank venerable sovereign of five elements, and a monarch weapon Dao domain ... I'm afraid it'll be difficult for you and me to deal with them! Senlan has stopped the other venerable sovereigns from interfering, and it's obvious that she's looking at us as a joke ... Now, we can only ask for help!"The two of them looked at each other helplessly.This time, he was in big trouble.In the sector Lord's eyes, we're both trash. Level 7, that's probably going to be hard!"Ask for help!"Shi hun also shook his head, his face helpless.I didn't want this to happen either!Wu Dian nodded. After a long time, he said,"Who do you think will come this time?""With the realmlord's personality, to fail again and again ...""This time, I think there will be many more comrades, and even ... Not just those two!"Senlan might also be targeted.Yan Fang and the others actually dared to interfere in this matter, angering the world Overlord. Even if they didn't personally come, if they didn't send three to five Grade 6 experts, they would be letting down Sen LAN.Wu Dian nodded. The possibility was very high.Just wait and see!It was just that ... He and the Soul Eater were finished this time. As for the seventh step, they might have to wait for the next opportunity.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.As the detailed information was sent back.The Crimson Moon world.Red Moon Lord's aura was a little cold. Two more Tier 5s had died, two tier 4s had died before, and one tier 4 had been killed by Silver Moon King, and three tier 7s had been killed by neo martial artists ...In such a short period of time, five of the Crimson Moon's middle-stage venerable sovereigns and three of its high-stage venerable sovereigns had died ...Back when they had invaded a great world, not many venerable sovereigns had died.Hong Yue, it seems that things are not going well recently."Sixth rank Supreme Emperor of life and death, fourth rank Supreme Emperor of five elements ..." He said slowly after a long silence."Where do you think they come from?"No one made a sound.This was hard to judge."Neo martial?"Someone said in a low voice. Red Moon master frowned slightly."We all know the venerable sovereigns and strong ones in new martial arts! With neo martial's character, if there were really strong people, would they still hide it? "Moreover, the neo martial world is difficult to cultivate in life and death. The other world has been destroyed once. Yin and yang dominate, life and death are suppressed ..."

Chapter 2935 Heavy Losses (8)
It was almost impossible for new martial arts to give birth to a life and death venerable sovereign. Therefore, the sixth-stage life and death situation was most likely not from a life and death venerable sovereign of new martial arts.In fact, Li Hao and the others didn't know this.Red Moon master, however, knew.In the yin-yang world, a large number of venerable sovereigns were out of balance. Under such an imbalance, if one could still survive as a venerable sovereign of life and death, it meant that the other party's world was completely balanced. It was possible that the other party would directly step into a rank eight great world!Therefore, it was almost impossible for him to be a venerable sovereign of new martial arts. "In addition, the fusion of life and death did not trigger the chaos lightning tribulation. In fact, the fusion of life and death was not that great. It was just for show!"At this point, Red Moon master felt a little more at ease."Whoever is willing to go," he said slowly,"take them down and kill them. Show the might of my Crimson Moon!"Seeing that no one said anything, he frowned slightly. Without waiting any longer, he pointed casually."You, you, and you ... The four of you will go together!"The four tier 6 experts were directly called out.The other venerable sovereigns were all shocked.In addition to the two from the other side, there were a total of six level six venerable sovereigns. As for Hong Yue, she only had nine level six venerable sovereigns on the surface. There were still a few more in the dark, but they were all working hard to reach Level Seven, so it was not convenient for them to make a move at the moment.The four of them saw that the realmlord had directly pointed them out, so they didn't dare to say anything and accepted the order."Remember, when you reach Senlan ... If the venerable sovereigns of Senlan dare to stop you ... Kill them immediately!"Red Moon master's eyes were cold, and the others were shocked.Was he ... Going to take down Senlan by force?"Yes, sir!"The venerable sovereigns quickly left to carry out the order.After everyone had left, he suddenly transmitted a message,""You follow behind. Don't enter the forest orchid world. Just stay outside the forest orchid world and hide in the dark. If there are any changes, you will attack!" "Yes, sir!"The space fluctuated, and the only rank seven of the red moon also left.Red Moon master let out a soft breath. He could not leave so easily. In fact, it was best if even the rank seven did not leave ... But he had indeed been angered!Sector Lord Sen LAN was too arrogant!In that case, he would wait for the opportunity to take down Senlan by force. One rank-7 and six rank-6s would be enough."Neo martial ... Where is it?""Damn bastards," he muttered."If they don't show up, I'll be trapped. Or should I just take the Crimson Moon world and leave this place?"However, if that was the case ... It would not be a good thing for the Overlord of the red moon region to leave with the world."New martial ... Where is it? Why haven't you shown yourself?"He frowned. Those B * stards were so arrogant that they had killed three rank Sevens. He could even believe that they would attack Hong Yue now, but ... They didn't show up, which made him a little uneasy.

He went to Tian Fang?"He thought to himself, will Tian Fang's great Dao universe open?He didn't even dare to take a look at it. What a bastard.Suppressing the agitation in his heart, he thought that as long as the red moon produced another Grade 7 expert, or if he could take down Sen LAN, it would be fine if sector Lord Sen LAN could step into Grade 7 and merge with the world. Then, he wouldn't have to worry anymore.With two rank-7s in charge of the world, he was not too afraid of the neo martial art thief.Therefore, whether or not he could take down Sen LAN would also determine whether or not he could move around freely. This matter was of great importance. If not for that, it would be very dangerous for the tier 7 expert to go out rashly.Red Moon master suppressed his thoughts. At this point, he had no other choice.

Chapter 2936 Finally Caught It (1)
Red Moon master had almost given everything she had.Apart from him, who couldn't go out and had to defend the world, one Grade 7 and six Grade 6 experts under his command were all sent to Senlan.It could be said that this was the foundation of the Crimson Moon.The Crimson Moon was very powerful!However ... No one had expected that three level Seven masters would die in one day. This was the reason why Hong Yue was so badly injured. If that day, if Wushan didn't make a move, if venerable the sword couldn't kill Xing Shen, if the human King didn't have the chance to launch a sneak attack ...Everything had changed on that day.At that time, the Crimson Moon didn't even need a rank six great world. It was too weak. If he came, it would be difficult to make arrangements. Even if he annexed it, it would be difficult to strengthen the Crimson Moon world. He didn't even care about a rank six great world.However, things were different now.Red Moon master even laughed at himself ... He was a level eight, but now, he had set his eyes on a level six great Dao universe, and he actually ... Had not succeeded!Isn't it laughable?'Perhaps I should be like the neo martial human King and not care about the Crimson Moon world, Crimson moon's territory, and Crimson moon's status ... If a level eight martial artist becomes a rogue cultivator ...'Could a level eight cultivator become a rogue cultivator?‚Äã Of course you can!At worst, he could just devour the Crimson Moon world and not leave it behind. Then, the great path universe would be fixed wherever he went.But ... Could he bear to do that? Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Moreover, without the individual cultivators of the macro world, without the cultivation of tens of thousands of people, without the hundreds of millions of people to strengthen the great Dao together, it was actually very difficult to expect one person to strengthen the great Dao.Why didn't the top powerhouses become independent cultivators? why did they have to become the masters of the world?That was because ... Rogue cultivators really had no future.Billions of people cultivated together to strengthen one's Dao and strengthen one's world. This was the Dao that all top experts could use.In the Crimson Moon world, this rank eight master actually had some absurd thoughts at this moment.He had been too aggrieved recently.He actually wanted to become a rogue cultivator!It was so ridiculous and laughable.He was an eighth-grade Overlord. Red Moon had always been invincible against chaos. He actually had the idea of giving up just because of one failure. Had things been too smooth for him all these years?The red moon Lord closed her eyes. Perhaps ... It was not simply because of her defeat, but because of Dao.The Dao of the Crimson Moon, the Dao of desire, and all kinds of emotions would be pushed to the peak.When he won, he was overbearing, arrogant, and crazy.When they were defeated, they were depressed, afraid, and panicked.Hong Yue's Dao of desire had its advantages and disadvantages. It magnified all emotions. He had been uneasy and terrified recently. He even wanted to kill his way out and give up the macro world several times. Perhaps ... Desire had backfired on him.Taking a deep breath, Red Moon master suppressed the uneasiness in his heart and began to cultivate, suppressing the restlessness in his heart. More than 50 years ago, he had decided to start a war with neo martial, and now he actually regretted it ... His emotions were magnified, and he kept telling him that he shouldn't provoke neo martial, he shouldn't attack neo martial ..."All of this is just an illusion. My Dao shouldn't be so weak!At this moment, the entire Crimson Moon world was shaking.A weak emotion constantly affected the cultivators in the Crimson Moon. They were depressed, disappointed, panicked, and crazy.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The forest world.After killing the two tier 5 experts, the remaining two tier 6 experts left the forest world and guarded the rift that Li Hao's group had occupied. They did not enter, but they also did not leave.Clearly, he didn't want to give Li Hao and the others a chance to leave.11 cracks and one realm gate.Out of the 12 places where he could leave, three had been sealed. There were still eight cracks and one realm gate left.Among them, the realm gates and five cracks were guarded by Senlan.If Li Hao's group wanted to leave, they could go this way.However ... If Senlan let Li Hao and the others go now, they would soon be attacked by the red moon sovereign. Therefore, as long as they guarded the other three rifts, Li Hao and the others would not be able to leave easily.This was the only thing the two sixth rank venerable sovereigns could do at the moment.Of course, at the same time, they were also contacting the individual cultivators and the venerable sovereigns of the three major worlds. In addition, there were some medium-level world Lords near Senlan who had not entered Senlan. They were also targets of their persuasion.The two venerable sovereigns hoped that they could get rid of Li Hao's team before Hong Yue's team arrived.In this way, the previous trouble was no longer a trouble.For a time, the entire Senlan, including the area outside, became lively.The venerable sovereigns came and went, and many of them began to contact Hong Yue.A great world, a level 8 great world. Even if it suffered heavy losses, it was still a level 8 great world. The itinerant cultivators were still very interested.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On a tall mountain.Li Hao's group took a break here.After killing the two fifth stage venerable sovereigns, Senlan no longer provided any more great Dao crystals. It was unknown whether it was because there were no more, or because of Red Moon, but this time, although the venerable sovereigns of Senlan had intimidated Red moon's side, they did not dare to take another step.He also announced to the public that he had terminated his employment with Li Hao.Since it was removed, there was naturally no need to pay the money.Li Hao was fine, but Heaven's Fate was a little displeased. "Senlan's side has made a good plan. With two level fives, according to the previous price, they'll have at least 100 million or even 200 million great Dao crystals! Now, you're dismissing us with just a sentence of terminating the employment relationship!"He was still very unhappy that the money he had gotten was gone.

Chapter 2937 Finally Caught (3)_2
Neo martial artists were very good at accounting.I don't want much from you, but you can't give me less."They might not be able to take out that much," Li Hao said with a smile."How could it be!"Heaven's Fate did not think much of it. "It's still a major world, after all. Although it's weak, it's accumulated for many years. Don't underestimate them. They're not new martial artists, nor are they Silver Moon!"The time between the two of them was too short.Under normal circumstances, he would have accumulated a lot.It had been hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. Moreover, a macro world like Senlan could only accommodate a limited number of venerable sovereigns, which caused the later generations to be almost unable to make any progress, so the consumption was not large.The world was constantly in operation, absorbing the power of Chaos. Over time, a great world could still accumulate many great Dao crystals.Senlan definitely had it!Li Hao smiled and nodded."Of course there are. But ... In order to advance and reach Level Seven, the power of the great Dao of the entire great Dao universe must be instantly replenished. Otherwise, you'll only be at Level Seven, but you won't have the strength of Level Seven."Sen LAN must have accumulated a lot, but Li Hao also knew that sector Lord Sen LAN hoped to advance. Since that was the case...It was normal for the next advancement to exhaust all the accumulated resources of the world."You ..."Heaven's Fate was speechless and didn't say anything else. Even Li Hao wasn't in a hurry, so why should he?He only felt that it was a pity.If it were the human King, he would have gone mad and killed them directly. How dare you owe money and not pay up!Li Hao didn't really care. 200 million Dao crystals?So what if it was 300 million?To be honest, a great Dao crystal was definitely useful. It was a source of energy and a condensation of the power of a great Dao ... But even if Li Hao was given one billion, he might not be able to reach level five.Qian Wuliang and the others might not be able to break through to Level 4 even if they had more.Sometimes, energy was not the only thing.Of course, it would be better if Senlan gave it to him. If she didn't ... He would think about it in the future. If things went well, then so be it. If things didn't go well, and Senlan caused trouble, he would pay it back a hundred times over sooner or later.If Senlan could cooperate with him and plunder the Crimson Moon, Li Hao wouldn't care about 200 million great Dao crystals."How many Level 6 martial artists will Hongyue send this time?"He looked at Kong Ji and said,"will the remaining rank-7 come?"Kong Ji shook his head, not sure. It was hard to judge!Although he was the son of a rank 8, he was not the rank 8 himself and did not quite understand how a rank 8 thought.Moreover, every top venerable sovereign had their own habits.If it was a neo martial artist ... Then they would come in a swarm.As for Red Moon, she might be more cautious after living for so long.Li Hao lightly tapped his leg and looked up into the sky. Before, sector Lord Sen LAN seemed to have had a brief contact with Red Moon Lord ... This meant that Red Moon Lord might have really been angered.The problem was that a level 8 was enraged by the death of two level 5s ... This was not the result Li Hao wanted to see.He was more worried now. With a few rank 6s dead, Red Moon Lord might really make a move.The other party ... Might have been in a state of explosive power because three of his rank Sevens had died.He looked at Qian Wuliang."Wuliang, the path of desire has been cultivated to the extreme. Is the control stronger or weaker?"Qian Wuliang was stunned. Li Hao hadn't asked him about these things for a long time.At this moment, he thought hard and carefully said,""I can't tell for sure. I'm not invincible, so ... I'm more careful. I think more before I do anything."This was also the truth.He didn't dare to lie to Li Hao. After some thought, he said,""However, if I become an Overlord and become invincible in the world ... Emotions and desires are actually not quite the same, but they have something in common. By then, it might be easier for my emotions to erupt more intensely!" Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Li Hao rubbed his head."This means that if we really kill a few Stage 6 experts this time, the other party might really disregard everything and come here. I've also considered that once sector Lord Sen LAN reaches Stage 7, he would stay behind to suppress him ... But what if he feels that we've seriously challenged his authority and doesn't care about sector Lord Sen LAN anymore, but ... Comes after us?"Before this, he had actually considered this point. However, what he thought was that to Hong Yue, from the big picture, suppressing the Sen LAN sector Lord was a must. What if?What if the red moon master could not hold back?Why did he have such a thought now ... Because Li Hao had only killed two type 5 realm Masters, yet the other side wanted to descend. It seemed like he was rejected by sector Lord Sen LAN. This meant that this type 8 realm master wasn't as profound as he had imagined. On the contrary, he was more easily angered!This was only a fifth-rank beast. If more sixth-rank beasts were to die, would the other party be able to bear it?This test made Li Hao feel uneasy and worried.Kong Ji didn't pay much attention at first, but when he heard this, he frowned and was a little confused,""Red Moon master is a top-tier rank eight venerable sovereign ... He's been a little irritable recently. He wants to come here whenever he kills a rank five. To be honest, so what if all the rank five venerable sovereigns are dead? So what if all the Tier 6 experts are dead?"Your lair isn't safe, but you still want to descend every day. What's the point?Qian Wuliang answered in a low voice,""He might have suffered from the backlash of his desires! Hong Yue's desire is not just one Dao, but many kinds of Dao. After a few rank seven experts died, it's possible that ... There are fewer people to suppress the negative Dao of desire. Now, he's bearing it all alone, so it's easier for him to lose control. "

Chapter 2938 Finally Caught (3)
Li Hao nodded.He didn't say anything more. Since things had come to this, there was no way out. He said,""Then we have to make an even more dangerous plan. That is, if we kill a Type 6 and they descend, they won't suppress sector Lord Sen LAN, but us instead. How will we escape from a type 8?"He didn't count on the others, but looked at Kong Ji.Kong Ji had a headache.Why are you looking at me?Let my father do it?"But ... If my father comes, it'll be troublesome. This isn't the tianfang region, this is the Hongyue region. If he descends here at their lair, let's not talk about whether he'll come or not. Even if he does, can he really start a war with a crazy tier 8?"Neo martial!"At this moment, Kong Ji said that he could only use neo martial.Li Hao nodded, deep in thought.Yes, only neo martial would make the other party afraid ..."Then we'll need to make another arrangement!"Li Hao said,"however, only venerable the sword is here. We might need another powerful neo martial artist. When he descends ... Attack the Crimson Moon's territory or terrorize the Lord of the Crimson Moon from a distance so that he won't dare to pursue us!"He had to fake it again!How to build it?Li Hao instantly thought of Supreme ... And second cat ...If er Mao impersonated Emperor Cang, who would impersonate the Supreme one?Zhang an!However, he wasn't even Thearch Zhang an. He was too weak. Even if he pretended to be an eighth-rank cultivator from a distance, it would still be difficult to block the other party's detection. As for er Mao, he might have a chance. He was actually very mysterious.Ordinary venerable sovereigns wouldn't be able to detect anything.In order to prevent this from happening, he might need second cat and the rest to act as a deterrent ...At the same time, it was also to give the red moon Lord some thoughts and guesses after the matter ... That was, the one who had intimidated him before was not a neo martial artist, but a fake. That was why he had left the red moon.Otherwise, if neo martial didn't show up, this guy might not dare to leave.Li Hao didn't know when neo martial would make a move.Many thoughts appeared in his mind.At this moment, Li Hao had some plans. Maybe second cat still had to do something. As for Zhang an ... He hadn't reached the venerable sovereign level yet. He was too weak and didn't even dare to let him appear recently.Both of them were venerable sovereigns, and they could kill him in a casual fight. It would be hard to explain if the grandson of a neo martial Supreme died here.Zhang an's book of Dao was the most similar to a Supreme martial artist!However, his opponent's book of Dao was too weak.But ... What if the myriad worlds appeared in the book of Dao?Was he still weak?Not weak, right?Even if it looked weak, with the myriad worlds appearing in the book of Dao, he was still confident in his impersonation.On one side was the neo martial world where Emperor Cang was. On the other side was the forest world that could be easily suppressed. On the other side, Emperor Cang might borrow the power of the human King and combine the two powers to fight a level eight ... On the other side, he could strengthen the Crimson Moon after suppressing it ...In that case, no matter how angry red Moon master was, he would not pursue them so easily."Since venerable Red Moon Emperor hasn't arrived yet ... I'll go and have a chat with senior Zhang an!" "Senior, do you want to go?" Li Hao glanced at the celestial pole."Why should I go see him?"Heaven's Fate was speechless. I'm not going.Li Hao was puzzled. What? do you dislike Zhang an?Heaven's Fate was too lazy to explain."I'm already annoyed looking at his grandfather, and I'm afraid I can't help but beat him up when I look at his grandson. If he's dead or crippled, it'll be troublesome. It's better to avoid trouble. Forget it, I can't be bothered to see this Zhang an kid."‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the Dao River.Zhang an was still in seclusion.Was he in a hurry?It was very urgent!The road to becoming a venerable sovereign was too difficult.In other words, the path of an ordinary venerable sovereign was simple, but he had seen it many times and was ambitious. In the past, it was his grandfather and the human King, then it became Li Hao and the others. The venerable sovereigns of Silver Moon were either the Masters of DAOs or the Masters of worlds. At the very least, Lin Hongyu had also cultivated life and death.Was he willing to be an ordinary venerable sovereign? He was unwilling!If he was willing, he would have done it a long time ago. However, he was not willing. Therefore, he did not give up on the book of Dao. He was still cultivating the neo martial arts and ten thousand Dao.At the same time, he was also cultivating the Dao of the Silver Moon.The two universes were relatively harmonious. Otherwise, there would have been conflicts.However, at this stage ... It was too difficult to fuse the two great DAOs. He had already stepped into the half-step sovereign realm, but he was stuck here, unable to advance an inch. This made him very depressed!Was I wrong?I don't have the talent like my grandfather and the others, I don't have the opportunity like them, and I don't have their decisiveness. If I have to walk such a complicated path, can I really succeed?Many of the venerable sovereigns in new martial arts had entered the intermediate stage.In the past, some of his classmates and colleagues had also become venerable sovereigns. As the grandson of a Supreme venerable, what about him?He was still at the half-step sovereign realm.Now that he had walked out of Silver Moon, he seemed to be just as insignificant as he had been in the past.Dejection, disappointment, unwillingness ... Too many emotions gathered in his heart.When Li Hao saw Zhang an, he was a little dazed.Zhang an actually had a feeling that he was going to go berserk.This was ... A problem with his cultivation! Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  "Senior Zhang!"A low shout reverberated through the Dao River.Zhang an opened his eyes and saw Li Hao. The look in his eyes changed. He stood up and sighed. "I'm embarrassed. "Li Hao looked at him and slightly frowned."Senior, you've always been very indifferent to me. Why ... Why must you do this?"The fusion of two universes ... No, the great Dao of two worlds was too difficult.Li Hao felt that he was quite talented ... But he would consider annexing a world, but he wouldn't consider fusing the DAOs of two worlds.

Chapter 2939 Finally Caught (3)
Zhang an was silent.Li Hao looked at him for a long time. Zhang an was a little dejected. He laughed at himself."I feel that ... My talent is not as good as many people, and my strength is not as good as many people. If I follow the routine, how can I keep up with everyone? Therefore, I think ... Perhaps I should take a special path. This way, I might be able to step into the fourth or even the seventh rank very quickly!"When he talked about the seventh-rank, he seemed to be a little excited, a little excited, and a little ... Strange light.Li Hao was startled."Seventh-rank?""Yes, rank 7!""That's right!" Zhang an nodded and said,"the seventh-rank is the true Overlord!"Overlord?You want to be an Overlord?No, you're not that kind of person.Li Hao slightly frowned and looked at him for a while. He had experienced Zhang an's past, and at this moment, he seemed to understand something.In his memory, the little sister of the human Emperor would only say the same thing every day ...'How is my big brother?'Worship, adoration, admiration, fanaticism ...A seventh rank human King!Li Hao seemed to have understood something. He looked at Zhang an with pity. That sister of the human King was very wild because of her status as a human King. How could she be so fascinating?Also, Zhang an was often beaten up by that person ... Was he addicted to being beaten?At this moment, he finally understood Zhang an's intentions.If he followed the steps ... How would he move that person?Her brother was the Overlord who was extremely arrogant.Be it the Supreme martial artist or the sword Saint, they all doted on her. Emperor Cang was even raised as a pet by her ... Of course, in reality, Emperor Cang also raised her as a chef, just like her.She had seen so many outstanding people. Under normal circumstances, when her brother was so outstanding, he would naturally put in comparison when choosing a partner.However, in the vast Primal Chaos, how many people could compare to the human King?No matter how much he belittled the human King, he was still an Invincible Overlord.Zhang an wanted to be the brother-in-law of the human Emperor...What a crazy idea.At this time, Li Hao finally understood the knot in his heart. He had become a venerable sovereign step by step, but others looked down on him. If he didn't do it step by step, he couldn't do anything special.The fusion of the great Dao of the two worlds might be his chance to rise to the top in a single step.Even though he knew the chances were slim, he still persevered.Even though he knew that if he gave up one Dao, he might become a venerable sovereign immediately, he was still unwilling to give up. He was unwilling to waste time like this ... He felt like he wanted to waste time until he died. It was not that he did not know, he knew!Zhang an knew very well that he was a teacher, a teacher at Yuanping University of Martial Arts and the Dean of Academic Affairs. How could he not understand?He knew everything.He just didn't want to accept reality.A lapdog ... Cough, cough, the sorrow of an infatuated man. What was even sadder was that the woman herself was stronger than him."Senior wants to reach the seventh rank and stand shoulder to shoulder with the human King?"Zhang an was embarrassed."It's not that I'm on the same level as the human King. I admit that I'm not as good as the human King. I ... I'm just thinking that if I can reach the seventh rank, I'll also be the cornerstone of my neo martial arts!" He's no longer the grandson of a Supreme Being that everyone talks about. "In other words, by that time, everyone would not say that Zhang an only had an identity without the corresponding strength and status.In other words, when someone mentioned her brother ... He had the right to interject,""The human King is very strong. Yesterday, we discussed the Dao ..."He no longer felt an inexplicable fear and uneasiness when he heard the name of the human King.He didn't expect himself to surpass the human King, but at least, he would have some status in front of the human King ...Li Hao smiled bitterly.This ...Zhang an's thoughts really made people feel helpless.This problem was very difficult to solve.What kind of person was the human King?Even Li Hao didn't dare to say that he would surpass the human King level one day, so how could he let Zhang an do the same? Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  "So, you just want to reach the seventh rank, and it doesn't have to be a unique seventh rank, right?""If it's not unique, can it become a seventh-rank?"Zhang an looked at Li Hao helplessly. What are you talking about? which seventh-rank is not unique? Li Hao laughed."That's not necessarily true. The level 7 of a level 8 world isn't that impressive. It's only because the other party is the confidant of the level 8 master. With the full strength of the level 8 world and the support of the other party, they can naturally reach Level 7! "Or, we can simply seize a seventh-tier great Dao universe and have a chance of reaching the seventh-tier. There's more than one path to the seventh-tier."It made sense, but ... It was not reliable.How could he seize a seventh-tier great path universe?A level-eight great Dao universe with full cultivation ... Even if you, Li Hao, become a level-eight, you won't be the master of Silver Moon, and your River of great Dao won't take in anyone.Li Hao said,"it's not a long-term thing to stay in seclusion. This is a rare opportunity. I've known you for a long time, but I won't say that I've been helping you get resources for no reason. In fact, I don't have enough resources for myself."Li Hao said seriously,"now that chaos has changed, the Crimson Moon is the enemy of both sides. This is our chance! This time, I may need senior's help, but you must at least reach the venerable sovereign level before you can cooperate with me. Otherwise ... You don't have the qualifications!""If senior is only able to break through if you want to merge your two DAOs, then I'll let you go this time. In the future, senior can continue to cultivate in seclusion. My Silver Moon Dao will continue to be open to senior.""However, if you make a decision this time, senior, to give up on one Dao and advance to venerable sovereign to cooperate with us in completing this plan, the harvest this time should be quite good. I dare not say that I can help you quickly reach the seventh rank, but I think the peak of the third rank can be waited for a few days! There may be more opportunities in the future. We just have to walk the road step by step!"
