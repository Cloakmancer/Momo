They hadn't lost yet!However, his spirit, energy, and spirit had been crushed.Qian Wuliang instantly became silent.Probably.There was a sense of powerlessness.Li Hao seemed to be getting further and further away from them."In the past, when Li Hao was in charge of the great Dao, he said ... That in the future, everyone will be a Dao master! They had a place in the long river of the great path! "For example, the ten thousand races. When the sky was split open, all of you had your spirits fused into it. You should know what the process was like! You should also know that the older generation of us Silvermoon people control the power of the martial path, which is the spirit!" "In terms of momentum, I, Silvermoon, am the most unique and unique existence in the chaos ... As the master of the great Dao, you should do something!" He said.Qian Wuliang's eyes flickered as he looked at Li Hao's back."Don't look at him. He's ... I can't say anything now. Maybe ... Besides me, even I might not be that important in his eyes!"Yuan Shuo said, feeling a little sad.Perhaps, the cultivation of the great Dao was based on the integration of the Dao. Li Hao ... Had truly extinguished his emotions. In the past, he had integrated all his desires into the myriad worlds, resulting in today's outcome.How could humans not have desires?Li Hao turned his seven emotions and six desires into the human gate, giving birth to the spirit of the human gate in the ten thousand worlds. No one knew this, but he did. Perhaps the seventh brother of the human gate, black scale, who had achieved great success in his desires, was Li Hao's true desire.However, with the disappearance of the black scales, Li Hao's last desire was also extinguished.At this moment, Yuan Shuo sent a message to Qian Wuliang,""He completely destroyed his desires. When huntian was stabilizing the West, he said that it was not the right way for huntian to destroy humanity. He ... He himself also took that path ..."Qian Wuliang was moved. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "Wuliang!"Yuan Shuo continued,"you said that the seven emotions and six desires originated from the Silver Moon. The Silver Moon ... Is also Li Hao's only connection. I want ... To awaken everything about him. I want him ... To return to the wandering Martial Master Li Hao of the past, and not the Li Hao of today, who is emotionless. Are you willing to help me?""Even if I become a demon, a demon should still have feelings! In the infinite worlds, hei Lin was no match for Emperor Yu, because Emperor Yu was not emotionless. Pure desire is not a good thing, and having no desire is even worse!"Qian Wuliang seemed to have understood what he meant. He was a man with a clear mind. At this moment, he sent a message,"I understand what you mean. The Silver Moon King will always be a Duke! The great Dao universe was given to me by Lord Marquis in the first place. Since that's the case ... I'll return it to Lord Marquis. If I can awaken all of Lord Marquis's emotions, it'll be worth it!""I, the heroes of Silvermoon, am not a coward ... I will listen to everything you say, professor!""Then ... Those who are not from the Silver Moon ...""That's good, thank you for your support, Wu Liang! Tell everyone to prepare to return the great Dao stars to the Silver Moon and completely merge the illusory and corporeal rivers. Use power to nurture the Dao and use power to merge! Convert power into desire, you will be in charge and listen to my orders. If the situation changes ..."After that, he didn't say anything more.Qian Wuliang understood what he meant and didn't say anything more. He contacted the others through the river of Dao and the voice of Dao appeared in their minds. At this moment, the faces of the Silver Moon cultivators who were still alive changed slightly.Very quickly, everything returned to normal.Everything went on as usual.However, some of them glanced at Li Hao in front of them, some looked at the cultivators of the myriad races nearby, and some of them, who had been feeling inferior, suddenly held their heads high and puffed out their chests in an arrogant manner!"Those who are not from the Silver Moon system ... Let's wait and see. By the way ... Black Panther, ermao ..." Yuan Shuo transmitted his voice to them.He didn't continue.He was only a little suspicious. The Black Panther's disappearance was normal. Li Hao probably didn't want the Black Panther to participate in this battle. He wanted the Black Panther to find a place, win, and return. If it lost, it could find a place to hide and be an ordinary dog.As for second cat's disappearance ... Maybe ... He ran away?Perhaps it was because time was lost that cat two didn't want to work for Li Hao anymore. This was normal. Cat two followed Li Hao because of the way of time.Now that time had passed, it was reasonable for ermao to leave.However, there was a slight emotional fluctuation.So, without Shi Guang, that cat was no longer reliable. But of course, there was no need for him to chide the other party right now.Li Hao, who was in front, suddenly turned his head and glanced at the crowd. His expression seemed to change.However, he did not make a sound.In the surroundings, the human king and emperor Yu's eyes flickered slightly as they glanced behind them, but they didn't say anything.Li Hao seemed to want to say something, but in the end, he didn 't.At the same time.The human King suddenly transmitted his voice to everyone, we can't just watch like this!A loud boom reverberated!The two experts exchanged blows, and their auras were turbulent. They were extremely powerful, and the power of tribulation covered the entire area. However, it was still difficult for them to deal with Tian Fang. If this continued ... The two of them seemed to be getting stronger and stronger. Perhaps this was also an opportunity for them to improve their spirituality.It might not be a good thing!The human King's insight was not to be underestimated. At this moment, he instantly looked at Li Hao and Su Yu. "Don't just stand there and watch. No matter who it is, they are all our enemies. I don't think the Tribulation can deal with Tian Fang. Let's attack and kill these guys. We'll seize the power of the great Dao. No matter what, every bit of strength we get counts!"Emperor Yu also slightly nodded.He had the same thoughts.In this situation ... Although it might be better to let these rank-9s help the calamity, the premise was that these people were willing and didn't worry about them. It would be strange.

Moreover, their goal was to keep them in check.At the thought of this, he nodded and transmitted a message,""Then let's do it ... There are nine of them, and we, the infinite worlds, shall take two!""There are two neo martial arts too!"Yuan Shuo hesitated slightly, but he still transmitted a message,""I'll pin down one ..."Spring Autumn was a little uncomfortable at this moment. Seeing that many people were looking at her, she just wanted to be more polite."I ... I'm quite injured. I'm stuffed to death ..."Why are you all looking at me?I came here to seek protection, not to die.Six of the nine tier 9 powerhouses were divided into three. At this moment, Li Hao also sent a voice transmission to the remaining three. "I'll deal with the remaining three, but ... I'm afraid it'll be difficult for me to kill the three of you. Since you only asked for two people from the human King and Su Yu ... I'm afraid I'll need you two to help me finish them off as soon as possible!"“……”The two of them were speechless and didn't say much.Alright!"You might be hiding something, but it's really hard for us to guess. At this moment, we don't say much.If he could kill the nine grade-9 experts before him, he might still have a chance!While the two of them had yet to decide the victor, now might be the time.The next moment, they didn't waste any words and instantly attacked!The type 9 powerhouses on the periphery had been waiting in formation the whole time. Although they had been paying attention to the battle over there, they did not dare to underestimate the people in front of them. In an instant, they attacked at the same time and roared!The human King charged out with his saber, and the power of darkness was boundless!Emperor Yu also merged the order and chaos into one. The power of Chaos was completely absorbed by him. At this moment, he merged with the great Dao of the other powerhouses of the ten thousand races. In an instant, he suddenly split into countless clones and surrounded the two type 9 experts. In an instant, a civilization book appeared and enveloped the two of them. He snorted coldly,"Enter my civilization's book and pass the Tribulation of all races!"At that moment, it was as if the catastrophe of thousands of races had descended. With the rich power of the catastrophe around them, one of the divine characters in the civilization book instantly absorbed a lot of the power of the catastrophe.Not far away, the Lord of calamity suddenly turned around and couldn't help but curse,""Bastard!"At this moment, he was entangled with Tian Fang, and both sides were on the line of life and death. But at this moment, the Emperor of the Universe of myriad realms actually extracted some of his great Dao's power. He was truly ... A disaster!How detestable!At this moment, he even wanted to curse and kill this guy!Su Yu looked at him with a smile.""Don't be afraid. After killing these two, the power of the Tribulation will descend again and only strengthen you ..."The Lord of calamity's expression was unsightly, but he didn't have time to say anything.Su Yu's words were not wrong.To him, the death of a rank 9 was not a big loss. The more intense the calamity was, the stronger he would become. However ... This feeling was extremely uncomfortable.What an animal!As for the human King, darkness and darkness converged, and he became stronger and stronger, instantly tangling with the two tier 9 experts.Yuan Shuo howled and combined the five elements into one, leading Silver Moon and the others toward a level 9. Spring Autumn was a little conflicted, but after glancing at Li Hao, he gritted his teeth and also charged toward a level 9!I don't care! Li Hao had said that he was still useful. This guy had many tricks up his sleeve. Perhaps, at a critical moment, he would help him.The remaining rank-9s were about to surround Emperor Yu.Li Hao instantly attacked!The heaven and earth Dao domain appeared and enveloped the few of them. The sword Qi was incomparably powerful as he revealed a smile."The three of you, why don't you spar with me!"The three of them had unsightly expressions on their faces, but they didn't say anything.Li Hao was very strong!Having gathered the flesh and blood of thousands of worlds, the will in their bodies was extremely powerful. At this moment, the pressure from their auras made them feel uncomfortable. Without Li Hao saying anything, they all unleashed their full strength.One of them shouted in a low voice,"let's fight to the death!" Everyone, today...Even if we die in battle, we must expand the calamity and make it even stronger. Let him kill these bastards and fulfill our wish!"Life and death did not matter anymore.It would be better if they won, but if they lost, they would die in battle, and the tier 9 experts would continue to fall, making the tribulations even stronger.Then we'll fight to the death!In an instant, a loud boom erupted!The power of countless great DAOs seemed to materialize at this moment and exploded madly. The entire chaos great Dao reappeared between heaven and earth and shook the surroundings!​ ……Deep in the chaos great Dao.A dog kept lurking forward. At that moment, the origin of chaos, which was like a heart, was right in front of it.At this moment, a huge battle broke out. No one had the time to care about it, regardless of whether they noticed it or not.Heibao was a bit nervous.Li Hao had asked it to seize the calamity great Dao, but at this moment ... In the entire chaos great Dao, the calamity great Dao was the most powerful, apart from the space great Dao. How could it seize it?As for destroying the origin of chaos ... Right now, the origin of chaos was giving it an enormous sense of oppression. It felt that if it went up, it would also die.Heibao was somewhat helpless.Li Hao had said that there would be a chance, but it had not seen one yet.What to do?Now, it could sense that a Great War had broken out in chaos. Could it be that ... Li Hao's opportunity was a tribulation?At that time, would he go and seize the Dao of tribulation?If that was the case, there was indeed a chance.But ... At that time, even the Tribulation itself would have been defeated. Even if I were to seize it ... I might not be able to do anything.Helpless, the Black Panther recalled what Li Hao had said about dealing with the origin of chaos ... At that moment, it felt a headache as it looked at the beating heart in the distance. Its dog head was about to explode. This thing was even more difficult to deal with! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  How could he deal with this?First seize the great Dao of tribulation and then deal with it?

There might still be a chance!And ...He couldn't help but quietly sense the situation in the chaos. Li Hao was fighting three level 9s alone and was extremely powerful. Although human king and emperor Yu were strong, Li Hao was not much weaker.After absorbing the flesh and blood, Li Hao became even more powerful.However, the Black Panther's eyes flickered.His nose twitched slightly, and he didn't look at her again. He only thought ...'This can't do. How can I be compared to this guy? I'm the master's favorite pet.'Yes, I am!I've been lying low here, but my mission is even more important.However, he couldn't help but think,'if I don't get some credit this time, I really won't have the face to see anyone.He then thought of Li Hao ... Although he didn't understand, he didn't think about it anymore.She was worried that if she thought too much, something would happen.This place was not a safe place."As soon as I'm defeated by the Tribulation, I'll seize his great Dao and attack the prime essences of chaos...Mm, that's it ..."Black Panther had also made up his mind. Let's do it this way.As for whether it will succeed, I don't know.……The entire chaos was in a state of unrest due to the great battle between these experts!Countless worlds were shaking violently.Countless venerable sovereigns and ordinary cultivators were worried, as if the world was about to be destroyed and the sky and earth were about to collapse. They were depressed and helpless.Some people knew that today was the day of the final battle between the various powers of the chaos.However, there were some people who knew nothing about it.They did not know what had happened at all. They only knew that the sky seemed to be collapsing!The world was about to collapse!Countless worlds were in turmoil. The world Lords all revealed looks of despair. If this continued ... Perhaps the entire Primal Chaos would be in trouble. At this moment, countless forces of calamity, known as the force of the bed, covered all directions.Countless streams of Primal Chaos energy were being extracted by these experts.As the chaotic force was extracted, the originally dark chaos seemed to be much cleaner and emptier. Some cultivators who couldn't walk out of the chaos in the past could now see the chaos clearly!Some hidden worlds also emerged one after another.The paragons of the neighboring worlds also took the risk and walked out. Some were conversing, some were in despair, and some were praying.In the chaos, even the experts who were usually hostile to each other were no longer hostile to each other.There were Grade 7 and even grade 8 experts who gathered.They were communicating with each other."If this continues ... The great Dao will be in complete chaos and the chaos will collapse!""The master of Tian Fang might want to rebuild The Order of Chaos ...""Who can win?""It's hard to say!""Where should we go?""I can only watch, what else can I do? This is a battle between peerless powerhouses. Which one of the powerhouses participating in today's battle can we match up to?" Such words kept appearing in various places.Eastern Region.Some people in some worlds sighed.Some people looked at the entrance that had already lost its function and felt emotional and sad. After so many years, perhaps only after entering the heavenly Daoist temple could they truly feel the peace of the exchange of great DAOs.Even if there was a fight, it was only a confrontation of spiritual bodies, which was helpful for the comprehension of the great Dao.But now ... The heavenly Daoist sect was gone.Li Hao, the path master of the heavenly Dao, was also taking part in the war, and ... He might not necessarily be the winner. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Tian Fang was extremely powerful, the calamity was also very powerful, and there were many level 9 existences ... They could not see any hope of Li Hao's side winning."What a pity!"A venerable sovereign murmured.What a pity.Li Hao and the others had put in a lot of effort and paid a great price for the establishment of the heavenly Daoist sect. Unfortunately, it did not last long before it became a decoration. Time had broken, and it had completely become a decoration.As the heavenly Daoist sect lost its effectiveness, the situation where they followed Li Hao to fill in thousands of DAOs and fight against the strongest ... Would not happen again."Whether it's the Outlander domain or a tribulation, once the primordial chaos is unified ..." At the thought of this, some people shook their heads.Would they have good days?There was no need to talk about the Tribulation. He had unified the chaos, so chaos was bound to rule.As for Tian Fang...No one understood the master of Tian Fang, but they all knew that this person was too powerful. He even wanted to kill all the tier 9 experts. Under his rule, was there really any hope in the future?Perhaps, there was no hope.Perhaps Tian Fang was a bigger huntian, or even crueler than huntian ... Perhaps, everything, including their worlds, would have to be overturned and restarted!In the distance, the intense fluctuations of the great Dao became even clearer!Primal Chaos energy from all directions madly surged in that direction.Some worlds even started to float as if they were being sucked over. They wanted to stop it but there was no way to do so. This caused some people to feel even more despair.A fire at the city gate would bring disaster to the fish in the moat!If this continued, they would all be finished before the experts died.Despair started to spread.It filled the entire chaos!The gates of the heavenly Daoist Rite that were scattered all over the place also gave off a faint ghostly light, as if they were about to completely shatter into pieces with the despair. At this moment, few people cared about this.If the chaos was destroyed, everyone would die. The heavenly Daoist Rite would just be a dream!"AI!"Sighing sounds could be heard continuously.In the distance, the rumbles became even more intense!In his despair, the entire chaos seemed to shrink. As the power of Chaos gathered and the great Dao shattered, countless worlds seemed to gather.They gathered toward the east, toward the four-sided region.Some people wanted to push the world and stop it from floating, but they were helpless and could not resist at all!On this day, only despair and powerlessness were left in the chaos.

Chapter 3833 Peerless Swordsman!
The catastrophe descended. Chaos shook.Tens of thousands of worlds began to gather in the four-sided domain. At this moment, the chaos great Dao shook violently, as if the constant fall of rank nine experts had caused problems to the foundation of the chaos great Dao.It was as if he needed the power of the world, the source of the world, to stabilize the chaos great Dao.The worlds were being sucked in by a suction force. Even Level 7 and level 8 cultivators couldn't stabilize themselves. They could only watch as the worlds were pulled in. At this moment, despair spread wildly."We're finished!""Countless worlds are colliding ... Chaos is completely finished!""Even if we don't participate in the battle between powerhouses, it will still affect our life and death!""My people ... The end of the world has come!"At this moment, some of the world Lords had completely given up. They stood at the top of the world and were filled with despair."In the chaos, experts are fighting each other. Countless worlds are gathering at the edge of the chaos at an extremely fast speed ... Once they collide ... The worlds will be destroyed, and I can't do anything about it!"Some world Lords were already making their final declaration and bidding farewell.He felt somewhat helpless!The powerhouses haven't died yet, but we'll be the first to die.At this moment, countless worlds began to shake, and countless living beings were instantly in a panic.Incomparably astonished!How could this be?The world wasn't clear to them and many others, but they knew that their King, their Emperor, and their unrivaled warrior were all wailing in despair!……A great battle was about to erupt.The human King and a few others were currently fighting a Grade 9.At this moment, Li Hao was also struggling to resist the siege of three top experts. These people were all prepared to die, and they were all top-notch existences. At this moment, they were also forcing Li Hao to retreat!Compared to the human king and emperor Yu's outbursts, which suppressed the two great experts, Li Hao's side had one more person, so it was difficult to suppress them. On the contrary, he was being suppressed by the three of them to the point that he could not breathe.The sword Qi was continuously being destroyed.Frowning, Li Hao retreated continuously. Countless Dao domains emerged. Although a single Dao domain was not powerful, the appearance of a large number of Dao domains still managed to hold back the three of them.BOOM!With a loud bang, Spring Autumn was wailing,""Help!"Spring Autumn, who was already heavily injured, had lost almost all of his clones. At this moment, he completely lost the strength to fight against a tier 9 expert. In just a moment, he was forced to retreat. At this moment, he had no choice but to cry for help!In the past, she knew that no one would respond even if she shouted.However, Li Hao had said that she was still useful if she survived ... So she might as well try shouting.Li Hao suddenly turned his head and instantly frowned. Spring and autumn was no match for a Grade 9!The others were fine. Yuan Shuo had Silver Moon members and was able to suppress their opponents, but Spring Autumn and Li Hao were having the toughest time. Li Hao was able to hold on for a while, but Spring Autumn was having a hard time.Seeing that Spring Autumn was no match for his opponent, and that the human King and the others were in a fierce battle, Yuan Shuo suddenly roared,""The rest of you, go help Spring Autumn. I'll take care of this!"Silver Moon, there were still some people alive.In truth, it would be difficult for him to match up to an opponent by himself. However, he could at least hold on for a while. At this moment, the only one who still had the strength to spare was Silver Moon. The myriad worlds had already fused with the Dao and new heavens, so they could not spare any manpower."Let's go!"Qian Wuliang shouted in a low voice.In an instant, dozens of Silver Moon cultivators turned around and charged toward Spring Autumn. The moment they retreated, Yuan Shuo felt immense pressure. He unleashed the power of the five elements, but he was still unable to match his opponent.He didn't say anything.However, the five Forces exploded out crazily, mixed with sword essence. He did not say a word and tried his best to block the opponent!Out of the corner of his eye, he looked at Li Hao.He took a look and was slightly stunned.On the other side, Li Hao suddenly seemed to turn illusionary. In an instant, one of them attacked and seemed to have pierced through his opponent's flesh. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, but Li Hao seemed to have shrunk in an instant. Only his flesh and blood flew, and he himself didn't suffer any serious injuries.However, his eyes grew colder and sharper, as if he was very angry.Yuan Shuo only took one look and was forced back by his opponent. He roared and punched out again. The Tiger roared in the forest and shook the heaven and earth. The power of the five elements turned into a monster again, floating above his head and merging with the great Dao. Like a monster, it rushed toward the great Dao of his opponent!Yuan Shuo's thoughts were also wandering at this moment. At this rate, although the human king and emperor Yu were strong, it would be extremely difficult to kill two level nine experts with their trump cards exposed.The spring and autumn era and his side would be defeated sooner or later.As for Li Hao ... He was actually very strong in a one-on-three battle, but ... From the looks of it, he was about to lose. At that time, he would be exhausted. Even if he won, how could he compete with calamity and tianfang?Everyone had exhausted their strength. Even if a winner was decided between the two, they would not win in the end."Qian Wuliang!"Yuan Shuo suddenly turned around, and Qian Wuliang and the others were shocked! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Now?They thought that they would have to delay for a while more. Was it that fast?In the crowd, many people looked at Li Hao and Yuan Shuo silently. Qian Wuliang was also in a state of extreme emotion. For the first time in his life, he roared, "I'm here!"He's here!She had always been there.In the past, he had wanted to become the leader of the rebel army, but he had been captured by Li Hao and had pledged his loyalty to him. Today, he had been present in all the major battles.He had never avoided battle.However ... The Silvermoon people, or rather, the Silvermoon martial masters, seemed to have never cared about him. They had never cared about him, looked down on him, and looked down on him. This was because ... He was hypocritical, he was a hypocrite, and it was difficult for him to integrate into their group.

Chapter 3834 Peerless Swordsman!
Only a few people knew that he had paid a great price for the stability of the Silver Moon and never slacked off.He's here!He had never left.Yuan Shuo laughed heartily."It's good that you're here!"Opposite him, the grade-9 martial artist who was suppressing him had a cold look in his eyes. He kept staring at Yuan Shuo, and Yuan Shuo returned his stare coldly. The two of them were entangled and even their eyes were locked at this moment!As if he had guessed what this group of people wanted to do, the grade 9 suddenly laughed coldly."Yuan Shuo ..." He said.His voice reverberated."You're an incompetent person who only knows how to rely on your disciple's strength to continuously advance by luck. Today, you're already very lucky to be able to fight with me here!" Do you still want to kill me?" Yuan Shuo gritted his teeth."I was able to use my disciple's strength to advance to this stage because I had good taste. Do you have the same taste?" Can you cultivate such a disciple? I'm eating and drinking my disciple's food, what does that have to do with you? Are you jealous? Are you envious?"Then, he burst into laughter!He seemed extremely proud!"Taking in a disciple and retiring in retirement is the greatest wish of countless martial masters in Silvermoon, and I'm the only one who's really done it. Are you sure you can do it?"The type 9 expert's expression didn't change.Since Yuan Shuo was not affected, he would not say anything more.At the same time, the dozens of Masters on Silver Moon Martial master's side suddenly felt the great Dao stars in their bodies fluctuate and two long rivers appeared above Qian Wuliang's head.The other grade-9 cultivators instantly realized what these people were up to.Silver Moon, neo martial, and myriad world were three in one, and the inheritance was similar. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ First, the new warrior human King merged the yin and yang, and then the Emperor of universe opened the new Sky and merged the Dao. At this moment, when Qian Wuliang came out of the river, everyone knew what they were going to do!In just a second, the level 9 warrior who was fighting against spring and autumn dashed toward Qian Wuliang!These people were first-class in Dao integration.They weren't strong at first, but once they fused with the Dao, their combat power would soar.The three families were connected!With the experience of the previous two sects killing a tier 9 with Dao integration, how could they ignore it again?At this moment, the Thunder Emperor erupted. Tens of thousands of Thunderbolts suddenly absorbed the power of countless Thunderbolts in the air. On the other side, venerable sovereign calamity really wanted to curse!These bastards!It was fine if he didn't help ... But to continuously extract the power of the great Dao in the air, he was really an animal.The Thunder monarch's face was cold and fierce."You want to cause trouble? get past us!"He instantly appeared in front of a rank nine venerable sovereign. At the same time, Dao Qi, Kong Ji, Sen LAN, Wu Shan, and myriad transformations, a few rank eight venerable sovereigns, appeared.Kong Ji looked at Li Hao in the distance.At this moment, Li Hao also turned his head and looked at them. He frowned slightly, as if he was hesitating. He glanced at them and sighed in his heart. The great Dao is heartless. As expected ... Even at this moment, Li Hao actually knew what everyone was doing. But ... He did not say anything to stop her.Even if ... After they were stopped, everyone would still be the same, but at least ... They would feel a little relieved."Fellow Daoist Hao Yue ... We've all followed you to this day ... We'll pay you back!"Kong Ji thought to himself. He recalled the first time he met Li Hao. Li Hao wasn't strong, but he had his own bearing. He was proud and unruffled. Even in front of experts, he could speak with assurance.When he talked about the great Dao, he was very confident. There was no coldness or arrogance, only a bit of chivalry.He left Jianghu with his sword, entered tianfang, and sought the path of Daoism.The Li Hao of that time ... Wasn't as helpless as he was today. He made people feel that he was right in front of them, but a thousand miles away!"Stop him!" Kong Ji roared."Stop him!"Many level 8 experts attacked at the same time!The two extreme Dao exploded out instantly, causing the sky to change color. The grade 9 expert sneered,""Ant!"An eighth-rank, did he really dare to fight a ninth-rank?It's just a little more people!In an instant, a spiritual Dao burst out. The few of them were instantly shaken, and the power of their great DAOs seemed to be on the verge of dissipating. Behind them, although Chunqiu was injured, he also shouted.The chirping of cicadas could be heard!It was as if the world had changed color. Time passed, and the power of the great Dao in his body was flowing out crazily. But the next second, a small tree suddenly appeared in front of him. In the distance, the power of the great Dao in his empty body was flowing out crazily!The entire chaos seemed to be destroyed by him!"Solitary me!"With a roar, his eyes turned deathly still, and the heavens and earth were destroyed. He extracted the power of his own body and the power of the surroundings. In an instant, the small tree in front of Chun Qiu bloomed and bore fruit.Spring and autumn!"Eat it!" Kong Ji shouted.At this moment, the air of death was boiling, and his body was shaking. In an instant, life and death appeared. In an instant, it was as if he had overcome the Tribulation of life and death. In just an instant, he suddenly went from aging to decay ... To reappearing. In an instant, he reappeared!A reincarnation was completed in an instant!Kong Ji, on the other hand, seemed to have aged a lot. He had consumed a lot of his lifespan. In the blink of an eye, another fruit appeared in front of spring and autumn, and the life force it contained was extremely rich!Spring Autumn was shocked!He had just eaten a fruit, and his previous injuries had recovered by at least 30%. It happened very quickly and in an instant.When another fruit appeared, there was no need for Kong Ji to say anything. In an instant, she swallowed it. In an instant, the injuries in her body were healed again, and a rich life force bloomed in her body!What a powerful force of life Recovery!She cultivated the Dao of life and death, and at this moment, she seemed to have fused with the Dao of recovery. Even some of her destroyed avatars seemed to be on the verge of recovery.

And the emptiness was still constantly changing!The Dao of life and death, reincarnation.He had once said that in life and death, he should try not to leave if he could. He had advised Li Hao and warned himself. But today, he quickly reincarnated and drew power from the surroundings. In the blink of an eye, he reincarnated many times!Her memories seemed to have faded.Some memories seemed to have turned into smoke and disappeared.In front of him, the grade-9 expert was already charging towards him. At this moment, he was empty. There were many emotions in his eyes, many complicated emotions. There was only some melancholy.So this was the life and death reincarnation.After many times ... He would lose all interest in life.Li Hao, are you the same?Haoyue ... My fellow Daoist, perhaps, there won't be a day where we can discuss the Dao."Nirvana!"He had gathered all his strength in this punch, like a Mantis trying to stop a chariot, but he still managed to punch out. This punch seemed to be the gathering of thousands of DAOs, like Li Hao's sword!Kong Ji's cold voice reverberated in all directions,""Great Nirvana!" The void seemed to be frozen!Everything in the world seemed to be destroyed. Behind him, a sense of exhaustion appeared. Spring and autumn's face was red, as if he had recovered. He was confident, and he punched out with the power of emptiness, destroying everything in the world!The empty body began to die instantly. It was better to die than to die!I'll perish, the world will perish, I'll perish, the opponent will perish, we'll perish together, I'll do my best!Haoyue ... I hope you can return to how you were before.Friends of the Dao were rare.It was hard to find a Knight.Today, you are no longer you. You are emotionless and have no desires. You are not Li Hao!His body began to be destroyed, spreading from his feet. The type 9 expert howled, and the space around him seemed to be locked down as the Dao of destruction continued to spread.The way chess had turned into a chessboard. At that moment, on the chessboard, tens of thousands of poisonous stingers burst out madly. It was as if the space was cut and the world was divided!The grade-9 expert was trapped within!An eighth-tier great cosmos instantly enveloped the area. The projection of a Dao chess piece appeared and looked at the distant sky with a complicated expression.At this moment, the master of tianfang also looked over with a calm expression.Dao chess was a weapon that he had personally forged in the past.However ... Ever since you followed Li Hao, you were unwilling to return. Tian Fang didn't say anything either. You chose your own path. If you die in battle today and your body is destroyed, you're also seeking your own death!Dao Qi saw that he was unmoved and smiled instead, as if he was relieved,""Being an Artifact Spirit is actually ... Not very comfortable. Tian Fang, your so-called 'pushing down everything' has never been fair. Artifact spirits ... Are also living beings!"Fair?Tian Fang did not say anything.The so-called fairness did not exist. An Artifact Spirit would be an Artifact Spirit, it was serving him, how could it be fair?Could it be that the purpose of forging weapons was not to serve one's own needs, but to be treated fairly?Was that even possible?Li Hao couldn't do it either.Daoqi, you're too childish!Dao Qi didn't care about his thoughts. At this moment, Wu Shan was also stirring the pillar of light in front of him ... He couldn't bear the Tribulation anymore and roared, "Aren't you guys going too far?"You're after me, aren't you?First, Su Yu absorbed the power of tribulation, then the Thunder Emperor absorbed the power of lightning, and then this Wushan, at this moment, was actually absorbing the power of fate.This is too much!He was being held back by Tian Fang. At that moment, the power of the great Dao was spreading in all directions. Although it wasn't too terrifying for these rank eights to absorb some, it was still uncomfortable for him if each of them had to absorb some!Damn it, are you afraid that I won't die fast enough?Wushan ignored him.His five fingers stirred the light pillar of fate. At this moment, a hurricane-like whistling sound rang out in the void. His five fingers instantly shattered. Wu Shan switched hands, and his fingers shattered again. Both hands were shattered!He did not say anything.That day, he returned Yunxiao's favor. That day, he felt that he was already dead. Even if he was still alive, his life would end there.That day ... He was pleasantly surprised to find out that he had actually been saved!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Using a large world to nurture me!She had never felt such happiness before.After spending countless years in Yunxiao, he had exhausted all his energy and blood for Yunxiao. All he wanted was to leave and enjoy the taste of freedom for a period of time, but in the end ... He couldn 't!However, he was not familiar with that person. He had only communicated with him a few times. He had only threatened and used him. They had only used each other ...He had paid a huge price to help him recover everything.From that day on, he understood that chaos was not that dark. Although it was difficult to find friends and confidants, the friendship of gentlemen was as indifferent as water. Li Hao's indifference did not mean that he was heartless.He was a chivalrous and gentle fellow ... Although chaos regarded him as a demon, in the eyes of Wu Shan and the others ... The demon in your eyes was a friend and confidant in my eyes.There wasn't much small talk or enthusiasm. They were old friends despite the age gap. He didn't know what Li Hao was thinking, but that was what he thought.Perhaps ... Li Hao never cared about it, but so what?His hands shattered, and the light pillar of fate was covered in a layer of black!The type 9 powerhouse's eyes seemed to be covered. At this moment, he actually saw darkness covering his eyes!Wu Shan was playing the funeral song of fate!A whimpering sound reverberated in the chaos as if it was sending the grade 9 expert off. The grade 9 expert roared and the lightning above his head struck down!There was an empty space in front of him. He punched out, and the power of destruction covered the other party.Behind him, the spring Autumn Cicada's chirping seemed to accelerate the world and make time pass.

Above him, the chess pieces shattered inch by inch. In the distance, the Asura hell covered the place. Monarch Senlan was as calm and low-key as ever. However, the Asura aura surrounded the area and was about to drag his opponent into hell!These experts outside of the Silver Moon system were also one of the few friends Li Hao had made in the past few years.From the four-sided domain to the entire chaos, it was these friends who had supported and supported each other that had allowed Silver Moon, this Young World, to reach this point.Not far away.Qian Wuliang, who was merging with the Silver Moon, looked over with a complicated expression.They were not here for Silver Moon, but for Li Hao.When Li Hao made friends, he didn't care about their background or future. He only cared if they suited his taste. He rarely made friends, but when he did, he would treat them as friends. He didn't scheme or make use of them. He just let fate decide.Whether you leave or stay, he doesn't feel too reluctant. He only looks forward to the next reunion.Today ... His friends did not disappoint him.At this moment, a few rank eights blocked a rank nine with their weak strength, playing the funeral song of fate for this rank nine.Qian Wuliang turned around and looked at Li Hao.Li Hao...Just felt sorry and frowned, as if ... He didn't feel too sad. Qian Wuliang forced a smile and thought,"are you really ... Really like this?"You're not like this!"You are not a heartless person. When I first met you, I once said that no matter if it was Silver Moon or the common people, you would not be willing. I have made many suggestions, but as long as I hurt people, you would refuse!You might not be a good leader or a good boss, but you ... Have a chivalrous heart.The weaker you are, the more you will show your sympathy, pity, and loyalty.'Why is it that today ... Your friends are willing to risk their lives for you, but you only ... Slightly frown?'"Melt!""The momentum of the Silver Moon!" Qian Wuliang shouted."Merge my Dao! The great Dao has feelings!"His emotions and desires burst forth at this moment!"Lord Marquis, what we want to see is not the current you, but rather ... The you from before. Even if you are now more powerful than before, we don't want to see you in this moment!Neo martial is willing to die for the human King, the ten thousand clans are willing to die for Emperor Yu, and I, Silver Moon, even outsiders are willing to die for us!You should be more successful than them! At this moment, a sigh seemed to be heard from all directions.At this moment, the countless worlds that were gathering crazily seemed to be trembling. The heaven and the catastrophe were still intertwining. Suddenly, the two frowned and looked into the void!He looked in the direction of the four-sided domain.They instantly frowned.A monstrous sword essence, full of helplessness and vicissitudes, and the power of desire broke through the heaven and earth and spread in all directions!In an instant, countless people's expressions changed!Countless worlds suddenly flashed with light. The aura of despair was instantly absorbed, and a bitter smile mixed with helplessness, pity, and sadness echoed through the heavens.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "I've planned everything out ... Why do you have to do this ... I, Li Hao, am neither a king nor Su Yu. I don't need anyone to die for me. I just want to be myself!"There was some blame, some pride, and some unspeakable disappointment."So, this is how the martial world is!""Countless enemies, countless friends. It's a pity that we don't have wine today. Otherwise ... We'll drink to our heart's content!"In an instant, the world changed color and the surroundings shook!In that instant, it was as if time had reappeared in the surroundings!Great DAOs crisscrossed the heavens and the earth. Passages appeared in the heavens and the worlds. A monstrous aura gathered together and spread the great DAOs. It was as if they had Gone with the Wind, but also as if they had come with the wind!"Li Hao!""Li Hao!""Impossible!"The Lord of calamity's face was filled with disbelief, while the master of tianfang only frowned slightly, as if he had seen through something.Kong Ji's gray eyes suddenly looked into the distance!From the other side, a person walked out.His clothes were as white as snow!At this moment, the sword on his waist was dark and boundless!It was even darker than the blade of the human King!It was filled with despair, helplessness, and desire!That person crossed the void with a single step, shuttling through heaven and earth. It was as if there was no chaos under his feet but only a great road. Before he even arrived, his sword had already drawn out and crossed the sky, pointing at the heroes!Li Hao, who had been fighting the three level 9s, suddenly exhaled."We agreed ... That it'll only be a while ..." He grumbled.The 3 grade 9 experts "faces changed!On the other hand, the human King was slightly surprised. As for Emperor Yu, he let out a sigh of relief and laughed, muttering,""I told you...It shouldn't be!"Black scales!The spirit of desire born in the myriad worlds was also the Dao of desire contained in the Stargate. It was also the Dao of emotions that Li Hao had buried in the past. In the final battle of the myriad worlds ... He had not died!That day, Su Yu had let it go!Yes, he had let black scale go.On the day of the decisive battle, he killed Mo Yan and the existence that devoured some origin of chaos, but he released the spirit of desire born in the human sect because ... The two sides did not have any enmity that day. Only he knew that the only wish of black scale was to get out of here and regain his freedom."Black scale ... We meet again!"Su Yu chuckled and looked at Li Hao, who was coming over."Sure enough, I've always felt that something was wrong. Since the power of desire is Li Hao's own, why ... Did the black scales disappear?"

But today, he didn't feel any desire from Li Hao. He thought that the black scales had run away, died, or were destroyed. It seemed ... He was wrong.But ...Su Yu also sighed helplessly.At this moment, the human King seemed to have understood as well. He couldn't help but curse,""I came out early!"It was too early!Li Hao had been lying low all this time.In fact, he had vaguely sensed that the saber in his hand had tried to run to Li Hao's side several times, even though neither the saber nor the big cat had spoken. However, he hadn't paid much attention to it before, but now that he thought about it, he quickly realized what it was.That wasn't li Hao, but ... Second cat!Since he had already decided to go into hiding, why did he appear now?In the distance, Li Hao, who was stepping on the air as if he had entered a no-man's land, chuckled and said,""I know. I came out early. I know they died in battle. I killed Tian Fang, and I can resurrect them!""I know!""I also told myself not to rush. I told myself to take things slowly. I wanted to make the last move and kill Tian Fang. I wanted to become the only Supreme expert in the world!""My reason tells me that it's not right to walk out now!""But ..."Li Hao suddenly laughed."But my friends, my emotions, my desires, and my world are telling me that my friends, my teachers, and my people are going to die. They seem to be trying to wake up my conscience!""They seem to think that I'm not who I am ... They're too sharp!"Li Hao laughed carefreely."They still remember me. They still think of me. I think that if I don't come out and see them, they won't be satisfied and happy even if they die! Right or wrong, success or failure, why should we care?"Li Hao laughed."I want to ride the wind and rise, but I'm afraid that I'll lose my friends, my master, my elders, my fellow Daoists, and the martial arts world. What else can I have? Then you'll have nothing!"The man arrived!The sword was drawn!The sword light was so bright that it cut through the darkness and despair. As the sword was drawn, it was as if the world had reappeared!"I could have waited until the end, but you forced me to walk out ... A bunch of troublesome guys. You've never let me worry, not even once ..."Laughter and scoldings resounded throughout the chaos!"Qian Wuliang, you useless piece of trash. I thought you would be more rational and would stick to your position as the Dao master. You have disappointed me. How can an irrational leader be in charge of Silver Moon?" "Teacher, I thought you would wake up after a few deaths, but you're still so naive. The demon of five birds ... Is not worthy of you. You should be called the Saint of five birds!""Brother Kong Ji, Hao Yue, I didn't let you down. I'm still me ... Only, you've gone through several reincarnations, so I'm afraid that you're no longer you. You're really making me worry. You still want to chase after the human King. You're just a little short. The human King is so calm!""Thunderlord, Wushan, Senlan, daoqi ... You actually went crazy with them. Are you tired of living? They're incompetent, so they forced the realm Masters to die. Ever since I, Li Hao, made me, the Silver Moon Martial Master, die once, I've regretted it for the rest of my life. When my teacher died a second time, I knew that I shouldn't have made anyone die for me again ... You ... Are really ... Unreasonable!"Li Hao's smile was as bright as the sun!Despair and hope, darkness and holiness, desire erupting, and passion blooming!At this moment, Li Hao was completely different from the Li Hao that second cat had transformed into.He was also completely different from the Li Hao that others knew!"I admit that I'm unparalleled in my schemes and that I've always wanted to control the overall situation ... Unfortunately ... The ones who have ruined my plans have always been my own people. As expected, pig teammates always make me helpless!"The sound of laughter and scolding continued to spread, laughing and scolding."Hu Qingfeng, your summoning technique can even fool me, so why can't you fool them? Why do they think you're heartless? Am I a heartless person in your eyes? You trash, you only know how to flatter me. When it comes to a critical moment, you're of no use at all!""Li Hao" who was in the middle of a fierce battle with the three powerhouses suddenly became a little shaken and shaky. Hu Qingfeng's voice came out of "Li Hao 's" mouth, and it was a very nauseating flattery."Lord Marquis is unparalleled in the world. His chivalrous bones and gentleness are things I can't copy. Senior second cat's copy is only the strict and dignified Lord Marquis in my eyes. How can it replace the Lord Marquis's one and only? only this can prove that the real Lord Marquis is not strong in power or appearance, but in his unparalleled heart!""Nauseating! Disgusting!"At this moment,"Li Hao," who could rival three level 9s by himself, actually said such mushy words of flattery. In an instant, the three level 9s on the opposite side were a little dazed!This ...This was ... The guy who had been bothering them for a long time?Who was this person?Hu Qingfeng?He had never heard of a nameless junior!He ... He and a cat had killed a few ninth-rank magical beasts and even kept the three of them busy for a long time. How was that possible? This was impossible!Even if the two of them were both at the seventh or eighth step, it was impossible for them to be so powerful. Even if Li Hao himself was so powerful, they would still find it hard to believe, let alone this man and cat in disguise.How ... Could he be so powerful?And Li Hao, the real Li Hao ... He had been hiding all this time, and now he had come out!

Chapter 3838 Peerless Swordsman!
He was no longer hiding!As these thoughts flashed through their minds, the sword intent descended. In an instant, countless desires, passion, madness, and despair seemed to engulf their essence, energy, and spirit!"Myriad worlds gather my essence!"With a chuckle, the world origin of countless kapok trees suddenly shook as if it was occupied. In an instant, the countless life sources turned into flesh and blood and covered Li Hao's body!At this moment, Li Hao's life force exploded to the extreme!Countless worlds seemed to have been destroyed in an instant!Li Hao laughed heartily."Today, I, Li Hao, will borrow the world origin. After I destroy the origin of chaos and rebuild the world, I will definitely return it!" Those who are interested can enter my Silvermoon realm and lend me a hand to fight against tier 9 experts, kill tianfang, overcome tribulations, return my chaos, and clear the universe!""I'll give you all the despair. I hope you can hold back!"Li Hao's laughter shook heaven and earth.It was as if the universe had been born in an instant. The Daoist field of the heavens that had disappeared seemed to have landed between heaven and earth in an instant. When the sword fell, the strong man who was besieged by the few people only saw a blur!Dao breaking!The heavens were collapsing!Li Hao attacked with his sword, and the sword energy spread in all directions. All darkness was instantly devoured, and all silence was covered.Spring and autumn was still in the midst of the God slaying, and the grade 9 in front of him crumbled in an instant!Spring Autumn was shocked!Li Hao laughed again."Spring Autumn, you're not bad. Fellow Silvermoon, the long river has separated, the realm has separated, and the Dao River has merged with the body of Spring Autumn! Today, fellow Daoist Spring Autumn will definitely be able to kill everyone. One body will merge with one Spirit, and ten thousand spirits will merge with ten thousand bodies. I will fight for a chance of survival for your demon race!"His words seemed to be the will of the heavens!His will covered the area, and countless wailing forces gathered together and merged into spring and autumn. The avatars of spring and autumn seemed to recover instantly. Time seemed to flow backward, and spring and autumn was stunned!Was this ... Shi Guang? no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  How was that possible?Time was flowing backward?Didn't they say that it was destroyed?Her many clones appeared, and Li Hao's sword intent expanded and covered everyone including Qian Wuliang. He laughed and scolded,""What are you doing? What an idiot! The river of the Silver Moon is connected to the spring and autumn clone. The past and the present are intertwined. I want fellow Daoist spring and autumn to become the most powerful demon ... If the ten thousand chaos emperors and the ten thousand spirits of the heavens are willing to help me, you can enter and control them. If not, you can just watch the show!"Qian Wuliang's face changed dramatically. He was overjoyed, but also a bit regretful."Lord Marquis!"He let out a shrill cry as if Li Hao was already dead, but he was truly regretful.It's finished!The Marquis had been lying low in the square domain, waiting for an opportunity. However, they didn't know the key. Li Hao was worried that the secret would be leaked, and Hu Qingfeng had sworn that the Li Hao He had summoned would be the same as the real Li Hao. With er Mao's clone, Li Hao was full of confidence. Moreover, the flesh was indeed his flesh.Li Hao thought about it and didn't mention it again after deceiving Tian Fang.Who would have thought ... That these people would really want to wake him up? wake him up, my ass! In Li Hao's opinion, there was no difference, but in the end ... Everyone actually thought that he was no longer Li Hao!It was really ... Hard to say."I could've just stayed dormant and ignored him. At worst, I would've broken the origin of chaos and reshaped them again. But in the end, he came out. I didn't want such a victory!"I'm Li Hao!"I'm not pursuing victory. The path of the great Dao is not emotionless. The road of rivers and lakes is not to be taken this way.Knowing that there was a Tiger in the mountain, he still went to the Tiger Mountain!He knew that the him that walked out now was probably no match for Tian Fang, but ... So what?Win or lose, it's just a game of wine!With these friends, with these good friends, there were no confidants in the world. Why do you have to win just for the sake of victory?So, he walked out.He traveled with his sword, crossing time and space. He walked out of the root of chaos. He could have been much stronger, but he gave up. It was meaningless!The sword slashed at the grade-9 and restored the silence.Her smile was like a flower, just like their first meeting."One day apart feels like three autumns. Everyone, I, Li Hao, have returned!""The five mountains are young and filled with the Spirit of scholars. Everyone knows that the mortal world is filthy, but I'm young and idolized. I've walked the Jianghu road and said that I have a good head. Right here, who can take my head?"Li Hao's laughter echoed in the sky!When I was young, I looked forward to one day making a few good friends, traveling the world, leaping on roofs and vaulting walls, robbing the rich to help the poor, and walking the path for the heavens. The stronger one is, the harder it is for oneself.Today, I'll throw away these worries and let desire take the lead. What's the harm? "Tianfang, disaster, you've all wasted millions of years without friends, family, brothers, and fellow Daoists. So what if you ... Win me?"With a sharp howl, the sword intent was as cold as frost!It pierced through the world!Heaven and earth were silent. Only that sword seemed to tear the heaven and earth apart and shatter the darkness. I'm back!I wanted to scheme against the heavens and wait in dormancy, but my friends wouldn't allow me to do so. My brother doesn't want me to sink.Since that's the case, let's fight one battle after another. I've already defeated countless of you!"Brother Hao Yue!"Kong Ji's eyes suddenly lit up and he laughed from the bottom of his heart."I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm sorry ... I'm very sorry ... But I'm ... Very happy ..."He didn't know that Li Hao had other plans.Therefore, he was very sorry!But he was really happy.My fellow Daoist is truly unparalleled."Disciple, I ... I was blind!"Yuan Shuo also bared his teeth and laughed apologetically. He then laughed arrogantly and roared,""I ... Have a unique vision when it comes to taking in disciples, no one can compare to me!""Lord Marquis is peerless!"It was as if this was the only sound in all directions, as if it were venting, as if it was roaring, as if it was roaring.Li Hao had returned!That's right, this is the true demonic sword Li Hao. It's like a demon, but it's not a demon, and it's not a demon that kills.At that moment, the human King exhaled. He laughed, mumbled, and cursed."It's a pity that I, the neo martial artists, have integrated into my body. Otherwise, I would have to call him Wushuang the human King and compete with him!"At this moment, Emperor Yu laughed. The time King ... Hmm, not bad, not bad at all.If the Li Hao that second cat transformed into is the real Li Hao, I'm really going to be disappointed. You opened my sky of ten thousand worlds, and that's it?So, you're still you. Hmm, that's good!As for leaving early and ruining the plan, what plan?He would rather die standing than to drag out an ignoble existence just for a momentary benefit!"Flowing time, if there's a chance, let's have a drink!"Emperor Yu laughed out loud,"on the path of seeking, one has to search from top to bottom. It's rare for one to meet a compatible person. Today, I shall call you senior. Senior Shi Guang, it's my pleasure to meet you!"Li Hao laughed heartily,"it's not too late to drink after killing them!" Kill!"The word "kill" shook the world.Countless "kill" sounds instantly appeared in the heavens, and chaos filled the air."Kill!"It was as if the heavens were collapsing, as if the earth was cracking. In that moment, morale was high, and everyone went mad.At that moment, all the venerable sovereigns in the heavenly planes looked into the distance. Suddenly, someone stepped onto the path of the great path and headed straight for the heavenly Daoist temple in the distance."I'll walk my path, I'll decide my future!""I'm looking for a chance of survival. I'm going to control this battle myself!""Wait for my return. Even if I die in battle, I won't feel despair!"“……”In an instant, all the venerable sovereigns merged with the gods and DAOs. They no longer held back and went all out!The eastern venerable sovereigns had swarmed out without any hesitation!We'll decide on this day!We'll decide this future.In the distance, Tian Fang looked at Li Hao and smiled. Then, he sighed."I thought ... That I would be able to wait for you, the strongest you, the you who could absorb all the darkness. I didn't expect ... That I would only wait for ... The you who has lost your mind! Li Hao, you've disappointed me. "Li Hao laughed heartily. Foolish!"His voice was like a Thunderbolt that struck the heavens and earth.It exploded the darkness and bloomed with light.Sword intent emerged. At this moment, the white-robed Li Hao holding the long sword was a peerless swordsman!

3839 Chapter 621
The white-robed Li Hao wielded a black longsword, and his sword intent enveloped the primal Chaos.At this moment, he had walked out.He would no longer hide, no longer hide, no longer wait.So what?Wasn't this how the martial world worked?"I know that if I go into seclusion for ten, twenty, or thirty years, I might be able to defeat you or even kill you. Why ... Am I not willing? That was because the martial world was filled with the beauty of an instant!Since he couldn't wait and didn't want to wait, then he wouldn't wait.The Lord of calamity also frowned. The look in his eyes changed as he looked at Li Hao. At this moment, Li Hao's sword intent was extremely strong. It was the sword of despair!As for Tian Fang, he remained calm.Perhaps, he was a little disappointed.From his words, it was possible to tell that ... He had known from the very beginning that Li Hao was a fake.In fact, that was indeed the case.At this moment, Tian Fang suddenly exclaimed,""In the past, Zhan and I had a chat. He once said that the chaos is like a home, like houses, and needs to be cleaned regularly. He and I once deduced some things together. Some long-term filth needs to be cleaned. Li Hao, do you understand?""You mean Emperor Cang?" Li Hao smiled.Tian Fang also smiled,"that's right." "This cat is the cleaning tool for neo martial, but chaos ... It's difficult to do so. After all, this cat is not the cleaning machine of the entire chaos, so ... I was in favor of you absorbing some dark power before."He revealed a smile.At this moment, he revealed even more secrets.Back then, his meeting with Zhan wasn't that simple. The two of them had clearly discussed the Dao, and even the appearance of the big cat was related to Zhan. It wasn't what everyone thought, that it was created by the celestial Emperor. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  Of course, all of this had become a thing of the past.Regardless of the old cat's origin, it had cleansed new martial, but it couldn't cleanse the entire chaos. Li Hao absorbing the power of darkness was a good thing in Tian Fang's eyes. Unfortunately, Li Hao didn't last until the end.On the contrary, he didn't think it was good.He didn't seem to be afraid of Li Hao.Li Hao did not say anything. He only smiled. Suddenly, the sound of killing spread around him. At this moment, the human king and emperor Yu attacked!The human King suddenly snorted coldly with a hint of gloominess!In an instant, yin and yang fused!A dark aura emerged from the human King's body. It was a little wild and crazy."Do you all think that you're the creator of the world? Do you really think that everything is under your control?"Tian Fang's words made him unhappy!The long blade flickered!He headed straight for the two tier 9 cultivators, determined to kill them.Be it the Tribulation or Tian Fang, they didn't move.Li Hao moved!At this moment, Li Hao attacked, but he didn't aim at Tian Fang. Instead, he aimed at the Lord of calamity. The Lord of calamity's expression changed, and he roared,""Li Hao! Are you crazy? You know he's strong ..."This lunatic!At this moment, if Li Hao joined hands with him, they might have a chance. But this guy was actually going against him.How detestable!How hateful!What was Li Hao thinking?Li Hao only smiled. He drew his sword and said,""Tian Fang, wait for me to kill the Tribulation before you make your move?"Tian Fang laughed and instantly disappeared from his spot, as if he was truly fearless."I'll wait for you! You're more interesting than tribulation ... Tribulation is the source of all disasters. I have no objections to killing him. " The Lord of calamity's face turned ashen!Tian Fang!"Tian Fang...You're too arrogant!"Even though Li Hao was the one who attacked him, he couldn't help but curse,""You're giving them a chance to kill you ... You idiot!"Tian Fang was indifferent.A chance to kill me?So what?He just looked at it and smiled. Kill me?It was nothing.He looked up at the sky, not knowing what he was looking at. It was as if he had returned to a million years ago, when he discussed the Dao with that person. He was somewhat immersed in his memories."Li Hao, Fang ping, Su Yu ...This should be the person you've been waiting for.Who will be the one you've been waiting for?……The sword of despair shrouded the world!Li Hao's sword was unparalleled in momentum and intent. The power of calamity was also dissipating. What other disaster could defeat despair?They were already in despair, so why should they be afraid of disaster?Thousands of worlds and countless living beings were in despair. What could natural and man-made disasters break their despair?Perhaps, there was only hope.Only then could they expel despair!……At the same time.Spring autumn's avatars were originally broken into countless pieces. At this moment, they recovered one by one.
