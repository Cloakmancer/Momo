        Chapter 181: Chapter 44 spoils of war (6)
        Li Hao gritted his teeth.”Teacher, I can only accept these conditions. Otherwise ... I’ll give it to you for free!”
        
        Hao lianchuan wished he could say that it was a gift for nothing. Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, seemed a little angry and helpless. After a long while, he snorted,””You make the decisions for your own things, so I’ll take one-third. Just don’t regret it in the future! If this treasure is taken away, you can’t get it back! In my opinion, it’s ten times more precious than what I want now. You ignorant idiot, when you become strong, you’ll know how low I want it!”
        
        At this moment, Hao lianchuan couldn’t say no.
        
        It was a little awkward.
        
        This ... Should she accept it or not?
        
        Look at Li Hao, he’s about to fall out with his teacher over this.
        
        He felt a little helpless. This matter was not easy to handle.
        
        He could only apply to take a look!
        
        At this moment, he didn’t say anything. He would see.
        
        Yuan Shuo seemed to be a little angry at this moment. He flicked his sleeves and said,””I’ll go back first! Also, I killed them. Other than the ones Liu Long and the others killed, send me the rest! This old man disdains receiving a reward from a night patrolman!”
        
        In fact, even if he wanted it, the other party would not give it to him.
        
        ……
        
        Yuan Shuo left just like that.
        
        Hao lianchuan was speechless as he watched him leave.
        
        This man’s temper was getting worse.
        
        It was fine in the past, at least he could deter them, but now ... It was not easy.
        
        He looked at Li Hao again and smiled.””Do you want to become a super?”
        
        “Yes, I do!” Li Hao quickly nodded in surprise.
        
        However, he was thinking in his heart,”I can only strengthen my body by absorbing the mysterious energy, but I don’t think I can unlock the superpower lock. Teacher also said not to think about becoming a superpower for the time being ... I’ll agree to it first.”
        
        This was an existence at the level of the three suns, so he had to pretend to be a good student first.
        
        “Huang Yun, you’re in charge of collecting the other mysterious energy. I’ll take care of this place. The rest of you can go back first!”
        
        After Hao lianchuan said that, he looked at Liu Long and said,””I’ve seen the performance of the demon hunting squad ... But I still have to say that perhaps migration is the best guarantee! You’ve experienced last night’s chaos. A person with a fitness level above 100 can’t stand firm in the increasingly powerful superpower realm! Unless you are like professor Yuan, who can also reach the warrior tide!”
        
        “Understood!” Liu Long replied in a deep voice. However, Liu Long’s old words were still the same. Migration ... Was not impossible! However, the premise of the migration was to build a fort near White moon City! He didn’t just throw them into a big city and leave them alone! You have to be responsible for everything, including their clothes, food, housing, and transportation, including their work...Otherwise, how many people will be separated from their families?”
        
        “The higher-ups have their own considerations, and we have our own. Otherwise ... Liu Long will continue to guard the Silver City. Even if he is not strong enough, he is willing to guard the last piece of Pure Land for the Silver City!”
        
        Hao lianchuan sighed and stopped trying to persuade him.
        
        A lump of iron!
        
        Although it was difficult to leave one’s homeland, the world was becoming more and more chaotic. Being isolated outside, danger could come at any time.
        
        As for what Liu Long had said, it wasn’t easy to settle a million people in one go. Not to mention, it wasn’t just one city. There were many small cities that needed to be moved, just like silver City. It was impossible to settle them all at once!
        
        Liu Long didn’t care about this. He knew that the higher-ups wouldn’t agree. He glanced at Li Hao and said in a low voice,””Let’s go back first!”
        
        Li Hao nodded and followed them. Before he left, he smiled at Hao lianchuan and the others, then said to Wang Ming,”Little Ming ... No, officer Wang, I’ll treat you to a meal next time. Thank you for your help this time!”
        
        Wang Ming’s face was a little red.
        
        Risking his life to help you?
        
        This ... We did participate in the battle, but the results are hard to describe in a few words.
        
        It was more like a disgrace.
        
        Fortunately, Li Hao didn’t see it. He could only grin and say,””You’re welcome, it’s what I should do!”
        
        Hao lianchuan also smiled and nodded. Once again, he felt that Li Hao was a good kid. Unfortunately, he was involved in a large organization like red Moon. His future was hard to describe.
        
        ……
        
        A moment later, Li Hao and Liu Long left.
        
        As Liu Long walked, he said in a low voice,”I originally wanted to train you ... But now it seems that there is no need. You may leave Silver City soon. That’s good, white moon City is safer.”
        
        Li Hao laughed in a simple and honest way,”boss, are you going to abandon me?” Why are you leaving?”
        
        “What?”
        
        Liu Long was stunned. Not leaving?
        
        “You should know that Silver City is not safe anymore ...”
        
        “That’s not necessarily true!”Li Hao laughed again.
        
        Should he leave?
        
        He didn’t really want to leave.
        
        Although his teacher had advised him to leave as soon as possible, Li Hao had his own thoughts.
        
        This time, the other party had suffered heavy losses and might not come again in a short time. It might not be a good thing to go to white moon City. There were too many powerhouses, and everything was under their eyes. Some things were not easy to hide, such as the matter of the small sword.
        
        Of course, it was a fact that it would be dangerous to stay in the Silver City.
        
        However, now that the small sword had been taken away in name, it was hard to say whether the red moon needed the sword or his bloodline, and when the blue Rain would come again.
        
        According to the rules of the past, this time, there was a one year gap, and the next time might be half a year ... There was at least half a year of safety. Otherwise, it would be useless even if he killed himself.
        
        “I don’t need to leave for at least half a year!”
        
        As Li Hao thought about it, he realized that there might still be some Red Shadows in the blizzard Silver City. It was not a good time to collect them now. He would wait for the night patrollers to leave before he went to collect them.
        
        Otherwise, he might have been discovered.
        
        This was a great supplement. The previous one was too big, and he had indigestion. However, if the others had Red Shadows left behind, he should be able to digest them.
        
        Perhaps he would be able to break through 100 soon. At that time, even if he went to white moon City, he would have some power to protect himself.
        
        “As for the spoils of war this time ... If teacher gets the bigger share, I can also get the smaller share. The power of the five elements can strengthen the five internal organs. I haven’t tried all kinds of mysterious energy yet. From now on, I can develop in peace for a while.”
        
        Many thoughts flashed through Li Hao’s mind. He really didn’t want to leave in a short time.
        
        At the side, Liu Long’s expression was somewhat complicated.
        
        Not leaving?
        
        This kid was really bold.
        
        Liu Long heard from Liu Yan that this brat had killed two experts this time. Thinking of this, Liu Long sighed in his heart. Perhaps ... It’s better if he doesn’t leave. He might have hope to see Li Hao become a super, become a Dark Moon, or even a sun glory.
        
        If there really was a sunshine who was willing to stay in the Silver City, the Silver City might be able to receive more attention.
        
        The two of them each had their own thoughts as they returned to the inspection Office without a word.

        Chapter 182: Paving the way (1)
At the inspection Office.

In the basement, Wu Chao and Chen Jian were both lying on the hospital bed. At this moment, Yun Yao was helping them treat their injuries.

Yun Yao seemed to have mastered some special healing abilities. She could help people heal without the help of any equipment.

Liu Yan was in a daze at the side. This time, she didn’t suffer any serious injuries, only some superficial wounds that had already healed.

“Boss!”

When Liu Long entered the room, Yun Yao, Liu Yan, and even Wu Chao and Chen Jian, who were lying on the bed, all looked at him with some apprehension and anticipation.

What was he expecting?

Liu Long knew what they were looking forward to, and after a moment of consideration, he said,”I should be able to retrieve the mysterious energy from the few supers I killed in the city ... But ... I’m afraid Yuan Shuo won’t give me the rest.”

After such a bloody battle, everyone naturally looked forward to the distribution after the battle.

This time, the 10 moon nether assassins were completely annihilated. Li Hao killed one, Yuan Shuo killed five, and of the remaining four, Liu Long took care of three at first, but one was later killed by the inspector.

If these four people’s Mystic abilities could be added to the team, they would have a hundred square Mystic abilities.

Naturally, he could not compare to Yuan Shuo.

However, compared to the team’s income from the past few years, this alone was enough for them to use.

On the side, Li Hao said,”it’s fine. Teacher doesn’t need that much. Maybe he has extra. I’ll talk to him. We can share more.”

Liu Long waved his hand and didn’t continue to talk about this matter.

No matter how many he killed, he would take them all. He didn’t need others to pity him.

On the other hand, Liu Yan laughed.”Little Haohao, you killed a Yue Ming this time. Just the mysterious energy from this guy is enough for you to absorb. That guy can extract at least 30 cubic meters of mysterious energy!”

30 cubic meters!

To them, this was already a lot.

Li Hao shook his head and said,”that’s the contribution of the team. It doesn’t belong to whoever kills the other in the end!” This time, if we really count it that way, boss killed three of them by himself, doesn’t that mean that our team won’t get any more loot?”

This was not how team missions were distributed.

Liu Yan was actually helping Li Hao fight for benefits, but Li Hao didn’t care too much about that. He just had to follow the team’s distribution rules.

Whoever contributed the most, whoever occupied the most.

If they were to calculate based on the contribution of the final kill, then a defensive type like Chen Jian and a healer like Yun Yao might not be able to get a kill in their entire lives. Then the meaning of the team would be meaningless.

Liu Long still didn’t say anything, as if he wasn’t that interested in the distribution of the mysterious energy.

Liu Yan looked at Liu Long and then at Li Hao.

“The night patrolmen have sent a powerhouse. Boss, do you have any plans for the Silver City?”

She knew that Liu Long cared more about this.

Liu Long found a place to sit down. There were still some wounds on his body that were bleeding, but he didn’t care too much. After a while, he said,”Fatty mu hopes to set up a branch, but Hao bu can’t make the decision. It’s probably useless.”

“I have gained a lot this time. If everyone can become a super ... There might be hope!”

He still comforted her for a while.

If the few of them could enter the Super System, it was not completely hopeless.

There was a high chance that those at the tenth realm would become the Dark Moon.

With several Dark Moon levels, it would be quite difficult for him. Even if he could not advance, he would still be at the peak of the 100th level. This kind of strength was still comparable to the strength of some branches. The only difference was that the night patrolmen would not give him some resources, including mysterious energy.

Li Hao didn’t say anything.

He couldn’t interfere in this matter.

At this moment, Li Hao was also trying hard to digest what he had gained today.

After absorbing a lot of the red shadow’s energy, he was full of energy and his body was better than ever.

The breathing technique of five birds had been running the whole time, but this time, he deliberately didn’t extract the energy of the small sword.

The energy of the small sword was clearly not as strong as before.

And this thing had great use.

It would be such a pity if he really did.

According to his teacher, Li Hao’s physical strength had already reached the level of over 100, but it would take time to transform.

Now, he should digest this.

There were still many benefits waiting for him!

For example, the red shadow in the city, the mysterious energy on his teacher’s side, and if possible, the benefits given by the night patrolman could all help him improve.

All of this came from Yuan Shuo killing a three yang expert.

……

Everyone was either recuperating or thinking about other things.

Li Hao had also been absorbing energy in a low-key manner to strengthen himself.

……

Outside the city, the night patrolmen quickly finished their work.

With Hao lianchuan, Huang Yun, the three suns, and Yuan Shuo, who had killed the three suns, the Silver City was safer than ever. No one would dare to take the risk in the Silver City without three to five three suns.

The sky turned dark again.

Silver city’s ancient courtyard, the yuan family’s courtyard.

Hao lianchuan had come here alone.

In the courtyard, Yuan Shuo was practicing his fist techniques.

The door opened automatically.

Hao lianchuan walked straight in and sat down on the side, silently watching Yuan Shuo practice.

After Yuan Shuo finished his set of moves, Hao lianchuan said,””Professor Yuan has been in seclusion for the past few years, and even I didn’t feel any abnormalities. It seems that the injury from three years ago has long recovered?”

Yuan Shuo smiled and sat down. He wiped the sweat off his face and said,”it’s not too early. In fact, it hasn’t been long since I recovered! The reason why you didn’t tell me was because you were worried. ”

Chapter 183: Paving the way (2)

“If I say that I’ve entered the tide changing realm, the night patrolmen might stop me!” Yuan Shuo said with a half-smile.

“Professor, you’ve underestimated the night patrollers!”

Hao lianchuan shook his head.”Actually, we have always hoped that the professor could become a warrior and become a superpower. Maybe Silver Moon province could have another three-sun powerhouse. But what happened three years ago caught us off guard ...”

“Alright, that’s enough!”

“Where are my spoils of war?” Yuan Shuo interrupted him.

“They were sent to the inspection Office. It’s not convenient to send them here.”

Hao lianchuan had no intention of coveting these things. The death of one of the three suns was enough to make anyone give up on such thoughts.

He did not come to find Yuan Shuo for this matter. After a moment of silence, he said,””At the end of the month, what’s professor’s thoughts on the remains?”

They had originally agreed to explore an ancient ruin at the end of the month.

However, at that time, Yuan Shuo was on the verge of death. If he went, he would definitely only be a night patrol.

However, now that the other party was able to kill an existence at the level of the three suns, it was completely different.

Yuan Shuo also fell into deep thought,”that place is very dangerous!” I was injured there three years ago, and many of my night patrols died that day. I heard that many people from the large organizations also went to explore, and many died! This time, the night patrollers are joining forces with some other organizations to explore together. Even people from the central region will come, right?”

Hao lianchuan nodded.”Yes. The losses last time were too great. Even the night patrolmen can’t afford it.”

Yuan Shuo considered for a moment before saying,”I can lead the team to continue the exploration, but the distribution principle has to change!” Before this, everything that involved superpowers was yours. I could only take what you didn’t want, but this time ... I want half!”

Hearing this, Hao lianchuan sighed,””Do you think ... That’s possible? This relic is not ordinary. This time, the night patrolmen will also put in a lot of effort, including me and many other members of the sunlight sect!”

Yuan Shuo was asking for too much!

Yuan Shuo laughed.”Then forget it. I’ll explore it myself!”

Danger ... There was definitely danger.

However, when one explored alone, all the treasures would belong to one’s self. He was also an expert in ancient civilization exploration and knew more about ancient ruins than these people. There were pros and cons to cooperating with the night patrolman.

“The red moon will send people over!”

Hao lianchuan looked at him. Are you sure you want to act alone?

“So what?”

Yuan Shuo sneered,”at most, I won’t go!” If I don’t go, it’s hard to say if those guys can even open the relic! What’s wrong with Hong Yue? Knowledge was power, knowledge was wealth! In today’s world, how many people know the ancient civilization better than I do? If you invite those guys, I’d like to see how much you night patrollers can get. ”

Hao lianchuan fell silent.

Yuan Shuo wasn’t in a hurry either. In Silver Moon province, who else could he look for other than himself?

Of course, if Hong Yue was involved, it would indeed be a bit scary.

Although he had killed a three yang, it didn’t mean that he could kill a second one, especially when Li Hao’s Jade sword was about to run out of energy. He wouldn’t have the chance to use the blood Blade technique a second time.

“I’ll go back and discuss it!”

Hao lianchuan said. This matter was no longer up to him to decide. Before they came, the night patrollers had a brief meeting and mentioned the ancient site exploration. They thought that Yuan Shuo would demand an exorbitant price.

She just didn’t expect him to ask for so much.

Seeing that he was about to leave, Yuan Shuo thought for a moment and said,””Since we’re already here, the Silver City might not be safe anymore. While you’re still here, how about you and I clean up the dangers around the Silver City?”

“Clean up?”

“What do you mean?” Hao lianchuan asked in a deep voice.

“There are still some supers nearby. Kill them all!”

“……”

Hao lianchuan was stunned. It was the first time he felt the old Martial master’s cold-bloodedness.

Kill them all!

Some of the supers did not go on a killing spree, but they did not join the night patrol. Some of them lingered around the Silver City, and even if they had ideas, they did not make a move. Now, Yuan Shuo actually said to kill them all!

“This ...”

Yuan Shuo sneered,”you don’t dare. You’re afraid of ruining the reputation of the night patrolmen. Then let me do it!” This old man isn’t afraid! What was he doing loitering around the Silver City? Didn’t they all want to do something? You feel that there are benefits to be gained from the Silver City, and there are no risks, right? Since that’s the case, I’ll do it. As for the scolding ... Do I have to be afraid of that?”

He was really not afraid!

So what if he had offended many people?

He had endured all these years. Now that he had stepped into the universe master level, he was even less afraid.

“Professor, this is too infuriating ...”

“Indecisive!”

“You’re the deputy head of the night patrol, not me!”Yuan Shuo replied coldly. I don’t need to think about what you have to think about. I’m a loner, and I’ve lived to this day. Other than a few students, I have nothing! Students were students. They had their own futures. If they were killed, or if they were implicated ... That was their fate. So, why should I care about this?”

“Are you going?”

He asked again.

Hao lianchuan sighed and said softly,””I can’t attack, but ... If there’s someone at the three yang level ... I can attack!”

Yuan Shuo nodded in satisfaction.

The next moment, Hao lianchuan suddenly said in a low voice,””I can’t act rashly ... But can you take Wang Ming and the others? Of course, ahem ... How about we announce to the world that you killed them all ... What do you think?”

To train the young!

Most importantly, he hoped that Yuan Shuo would be the scapegoat.

Yuan Shuo laughed and nodded. He agreed readily, which made Hao lianchuan a little uneasy.

Chapter 184: Paving the way (3)
Translator: 549690339
“Why don’t we ... Forget it?”

Hao lianchuan was a little hesitant again. This person had agreed too quickly.

Yuan Shuo laughed and said,”Xiao Ling, don’t change your mind!” Let those guys follow me. Even if they don’t make a move, it’s good to just watch. If they can’t do it, let them deal the last blow. It’s good for their future to see blood!”

Hao lianchuan hesitated for a while but still agreed.

He really did hope that the young people among the night patrollers would have more experience. He heard that their performance this time wasn’t very good, including Wang Ming, who had performed well in Whitemoon city. When he really came here, he also seemed a little incompetent.

This made Hao lianchuan a little worried. These young people were protected too well. Could they take on great responsibilities?

……

That night, Yuan Shuo moved out again.

Silver city’s southern suburbs.

In a Manor, the manor was very large and seemed particularly prosperous and luxurious.

At this moment, a man as fat as a pig was eating in the dining room. His hands were greasy.

In the next moment, the man’s expression changed as the roof was stomped down.

Like a demonic god, Yuan Shuo broke the roof with one foot and landed in an instant. He lifted the tip of his foot and kicked through the other party’s temple without giving him any chance!

Behind them, Hu Hao and the others quickly landed, their faces pale.

This was the third one!

Yuan Shuo’s killing intent was too strong.

This time, they had truly witnessed the strength and strong psychological quality of these old martial masters, who killed without blinking!

Yuan Shuo glanced at the guy he had killed with a kick and laughed,””What’s wrong? Still not used to it? If I’m not mistaken, this Manor used to belong to a giant merchant in Silver City! That merchant seems to have disappeared. Do you know where he went?”

The few of them did not say anything.

“It’s probably buried in the yard,” Yuan Shuo sneered.”Do you want to dig it out and take a look?”

Behind him, Wang Ming exhaled,”killing, plundering, and taking other people’s money-he indeed deserved to die!” However, elder Yuan, we’ve agreed to give us a chance, but now ...”

If you kick him to death, we won’t have a chance anymore.

“Last hit!”

“I don’t have the obligation to teach you, but I can let you see some blood!” Yuan Shuo replied calmly. Stab him a few dozen times and you’ll have succeeded!”

Wang Ming was a little conflicted.”He’s already dead ...”

Yuan Shuo turned around and looked at him calmly.

Wang Ming was a little scared. Gritting his teeth, he condensed a sword in his hand, stepped forward, and stabbed the corpse!

Yuan Shuo smiled. Behind him, Li Meng and Hu Hao looked at each other and followed up silently.

This was probably the first time they had done something like this, and they all seemed a little uncomfortable.

Yuan Shuo looked at it for a while but didn’t pay much attention to it.

You’ll get used to it after a few jabs!

As for the night patrollers, the new generation lacked actual combat experience. He had his own reasons for being willing to bring these people along.

When the few of them were done, Yuan Shuo said lightly,””The few of you, you’ve finally learned something from me. From today on, I’ll accept the three of you as my in-name disciples!”

“……”

The few of them were stunned.

What was going on?

In the air, Hao lianchuan was also stunned. What the hell?

Yuan Shuo said lightly,”that’s it!” “In the future, you can use my name to the outside world. You are the nominal disciples of Yuan Shuo, the warrior Qian master. The path of martial masters is the most important of inheritance! Once they rebelled, they would be betraying their master and destroying their ancestors! My disciples only have one rule, they can’t betray their Masters or humiliate their fellow disciples. The only thing my disciples have to do is to be friendly and United with their fellow disciples!”

In the sky, Hao lianchuan was still in a daze.

As for Hu Hao and the others, they weren’t used to it and were all stunned.

Yuan Shuo immediately became dignified and said coldly,””You’re not willing? Or do you think that I, Yuan Shuo, am not worthy?”

“I don’t dare!”

“Elder Yuan, that’s not what we meant, it’s just ... We’re night patrols ...” Wang Ming hurriedly said.

“What’s wrong with the night patrolman?”

“The person up there is your Deputy Minister,” Yuan Shuo said impatiently. “You can ask him yourself if there’s a problem.” “The night watchers are all supers, and supers don’t have any master-disciple relationship. They’re just my in-name disciples, so it doesn’t affect anything. Is there a problem with you asking Hao lianchuan?”

In the sky, Hao lianchuan thought for a while and nodded slightly.

In-name disciple ... In-name disciple then.

This was just a small matter, not too serious. It was not an official apprenticeship, so it was not a big problem.

When Wang Ming saw this, they didn’t dare to say anything more and agreed one after another, perhaps feeling a little happy in their hearts. Yuan Shuo was a top-notch expert who had killed three suns, so it didn’t seem like a bad idea to take him as a master!

Yuan Shuo smiled,”that’s it then!” I don’t have many disciples under me, but they are all official disciples. You are all in-name disciples, so when you meet in the future, you have to call them senior brothers and sisters! Remember, you must be friendly to your fellow disciples. If you encounter any difficulties, you must do your best to help! This is what we call fellow disciples!”

After saying this, he threw out a small booklet.”I don’t have anything good to give you. This is the” new book of five birds “. You are not allowed to spread it!” Especially the breathing technique, it can not be taught to outsiders!”

It was only a breathing technique, not the five birds breathing technique!

“Don’t underestimate this,” he said.”Supers don’t practice martial arts, but it’s not necessarily a good thing to rely on absorbing the mysterious energy! After all, superpowers are an external force, cultivating both the inside and outside is the way to go!”

They were excited. They knew about the new book of five birds!

In the past, he might not have cared.

But this time, Yuan Shuo crossed the boundary and killed three suns. Who dared to underestimate his new book of five birds?

Chapter 185: Paving the way (4)
Translator: 549690339
The few of them were truly sincere this time as they nodded.”Thank you, teacher!”

Yuan Shuo laughed.

She revealed a smile like grandmother Wolf. These three were all moon nether, and they were all very young, especially that Wang Ming, who was almost a full moon and not far from sunlight.

If he was lucky, he might be able to enter sunlit soon and become the backbone of the night watchers in Silvermoon province.

Li Hao had paved the way!

“Right, Silver city’s Li Hao will be your little senior brother from now on!”

Yuan Shuo added,”he’s a Martial Master, he’s not a supernatural!” His strength may not be as strong as yours, but he has mainly inherited my knowledge. You have to protect him. In the future, I think your little senior brother will also give you some help! As you all know, the knowledge of the night patrolmen is very lacking. Sometimes, knowledge can change one’s fate, and you all will need it. ”

They looked at each other, and it was still Wang Ming who spoke first. “We’ll remember what teacher said!”

“En!”

Yuan Shuo nodded and said,”then let’s find the next one. This time, I’ll give you guys more practice. The earlier you enter riyao, the more authority you will have. Look at you guys now, you can do whatever I ask you to do. You’re not free at all ... You’re really embarrassing me!”

Wang Ming and the others giggled, but didn’t dare make a sound.

There were still big shots above.

……

In the sky.

After listening for a while, Hao lianchuan roughly understood what Yuan Shuo meant and was a little surprised.

This Yuan Shuo was really concerned about that last disciple of his.

Did he do all this just to find Li Hao a backer?

Li Hao didn’t have any Foundation among the Nightwatchers, but he now had two junior brothers and a Junior Sister.

Even though it was just a casual remark from Yuan Shuo to force someone to acknowledge him as his master, he had to acknowledge this relationship with Yuan Shuo no matter what ... Unless Yuan Shuo was dead, anyone who dared to deceive their master and destroy their ancestors in the world of martial arts would be considered a great heretic!

The night patrolmen were still official and upright. They would not do such a thing. If they did, the night patrolmen would have to clean up the house!

“Yuan Shuo ... Li Hao!”

Hao lianchuan muttered in his heart. Yuan Shuo paved the way for Li Hao in advance, instead of teaching Li Hao by example. Was he hoping that Li Hao would join the night patrol?

That’s good!

In that case, he could deepen his relationship with Yuan Shuo.

Otherwise, after Yuan Shuo advanced, it would be difficult for the night patrolman to order him to do anything.

……

At this moment, Li Hao still didn’t know how many new junior brothers and sisters he had.

After a day of continuous absorption and digestion, he had digested about 80% of the red shadow power in his body. The remaining power would probably be digested naturally in two days.

Standing up again, Li Hao casually threw a punch, and his bones cracked.

Li Hao’s eyes revealed a hint of joy.

His progress was extremely fast!

He couldn’t determine what level he was at, but he felt that ... The power he felt when he attacked just now wasn’t much weaker than Liu Yan ‘s.

And Liu Yan was at the peak of the tenth realm.

An existence close to a hundred!

“Comfortable!”

In just a few days, he had improved so much from the tenth slash realm, which made Li Hao very happy.

Most importantly, he still had many benefits that he had yet to digest.

Coming out of the lounge inside, at this moment, except for Wu Chao, Chen Jian could get out of bed and walk around.

When Liu Long saw him come out, he was as cold as ever. He said in a cold voice,””It’s good that you’ve come out. The night patrolman has delivered the things! We’ve obtained 160 cubic meters of mysterious energy, including the Yue Ming You killed!”

As for the Martial Master, he didn’t provide such things.

“Also, your teacher has also collected about 1400 cubic meters of mysterious energy. However, the amount is too much, so it has been compressed and placed in the warehouse of the inspection Office. Your teacher has to retrieve it himself!”

“This time, there’s lightning, earth, water, metal, wind, and many other types of elemental mystic energy.”

He looked at the others and said,”this time, I’m the one who contributed the most to the team’s hunt of supers. I’ll get 30%!” Li Hao will get 20%, and the rest will be split among the four of you. Any objections?”

Liu Long and Li Hao took half of it, and the remaining four people also took half, which was less than Li Hao ‘s.

“Of course not!” Liu Yan laughed. It’s good enough that I can get it. It’s even more than I expected. ”

Even if the four of them split it equally, she would be able to get 20 cubes.

In the past, it would be good enough if they could be split into three to five teams after killing a superhuman. The injuries might be more serious than this time.

This time, because of Li Hao’s presence, she really didn’t suffer any injuries.

Liu Yan was naturally satisfied to be able to get 20 cubic meters.

Since she was satisfied, the others who were weaker than her naturally had nothing to say.

As for Li Hao, he received 32 cubic meters, which was almost the same as killing a superhuman. Liu Long also divided the loot according to this, directly putting all the superhuman killed by Li Hao on Li Hao’s head.

Seeing that no one had any objections, Liu Long nodded his head, “That’s good! This is the biggest harvest we’ve had in years. I hope ... Someone can succeed!”

It was filled with hope and desire.

As for himself, he was less eager. He thought of Yuan Shuo and the way he beheaded the four supers with a single slash!

A Martial Master ... Could also be invincible!

He was already at the peak of the 100th level and was still a long way from the warrior of the thousand world level, but ... If he were to reach the warrior of the thousand world level, would he still need to become a super?

Entering the superpower realm was known as sunlight.

Yuan Shuo of Qian combat could kill three suns.

If he also had the strength to kill the three suns, would the Silver City still be suppressed?

It was impossible!

At this moment, Liu Long, who had always been pursuing superpowers, was a little hesitant. He seemed to be less determined than before.

Before that, warrior Qian had disappeared from Silver Moon province.

The road ahead was hopeless!

At this moment ... Liu Long was thinking, if he were to shamelessly seek out Yuan Shuo and ask for his advice, would this person agree?

With the guidance of a warrior of the thousand warrior realm, he might be able to take fewer detours.

He looked at Li Hao, feeling somewhat apologetic ... Should I make use of this guy and get him to plead on my behalf?

Li Hao, on the other hand, smiled in a simple and honest way.

At this moment, he seemed to be very satisfied with his distribution.

32 cubic meters was not a small number.

As for teacher’s 1400 cubic meters ... That’s teacher ‘s. At most, I’ll ask for three to five hundred cubic meters. How much can I ask for?

The chance to break through 100 seemed to be close at hand.

“Rest well tonight, everyone. We’ll continue our duty tomorrow while the powerhouses are still here!”

After Liu Long spoke, he looked at Li Hao again.””Li Hao, you can rest more these few days and spend more time with your teacher. If you need anything, as the captain of the law enforcement team, your boss, you can ask me for help at any time!”

He was just short of saying,”you go to your teacher’s place. If you’re tired, I can even carry you there!”

Li Hao was also a smart person. He immediately understood.

Liu Long laughed in his heart. It seemed that he was truly convinced this time.

Previously, when Yuan Shuo was mentioned, he was unconvinced. It seemed like the blow this time was not small.

“Yes, if there’s a need, I’ll look for boss!”

Liu Long nodded in satisfaction, then turned around and left.

Li Hao, on the other hand, couldn’t wait to see the mysterious energy he had obtained. This time, he was prepared to use the power of the five elements. Perhaps he could strengthen his five organs and make himself stronger!

In the warehouse of the inspection Office.

This time, the spoils of war were all stored here.

The sky was already dark, but because the value of the warehouse of the inspection Office was too high, even if there were strong people in the city, the inspection Office did not dare to be careless. Mu Sen personally led people to guard the warehouse.

As long as Yuan Shuo didn’t take these things away, he wouldn’t dare to be careless.

1000 mysterious energy from many sides!

In a small city like silver City, even if mu Sen had a high position, he had never seen so many people.

Apart from Whitemoon city and yaoguang city, it was probably rare to see other cities.

The warehouse of the inspection Office was heavily guarded. When Li Hao entered the warehouse area, he even vaguely felt that many machine guns were aimed at him. In addition, the Secretary, mu Sen, was also here. Even an ordinary sunlight wouldn’t be able to take the treasure away.

“Li Hao from the law enforcement team greets Secretary mu!”

Li Hao saluted mu Sen, who was at the door.

He didn’t know much about this Secretary, but his first impression of him wasn’t too bad. When Li Hao had dropped out of school to join the computer room, mu Sen had advised him to finish his studies before joining the inspector division.

The second time he understood was last night. Although the Secretary did not go out of the city to help in the battle, he still tried his best to help Liu Long escape from the city.

As for the conversation between mu Sen and Hao lianchuan today, he did not hear it.

“Li Hao!”

Mu Sen laughed, his face revealing a bright smile.”Not bad, not bad!”

He nodded and praised Li Hao, but Li Hao didn’t know what he was talking about.

“You’re here to get the mysterious energy?”

“Yes.”

Li Hao nodded.

“Is it your teacher’s or the demon-hunting squad ‘s?”

“The portion allocated to me. As for teacher’s portion, I don’t dare to overstep my authority.”

Li Hao smiled shyly, a little embarrassed.

“I heard that you’ve made a great contribution this time. Liu Long said before that you could get 32 cubic meters, I’m really envious!”

He was just saying that, but in fact, he also got a share. He was the one who led his men to kill the earth escape superpower in the city. He was not going to be polite and had already detained him.

“I’ll bring you in. Are you going to absorb it today?”mu Sen said with a smile.

Li Hao nodded.

Mu Sen opened the warehouse, and the lights inside came on. Soon, Li Hao saw a large ice crystal Shield in front of him, but at a glance ... It was definitely not as large as 1000 cubic meters!

Li Hao was a little confused. The others were not here?

Mu Sen had also entered the warehouse. Seeing Li Hao looking in that direction, he smiled.”Are you curious that there isn’t as much mysterious energy as you thought?”

Li Hao nodded.

“The mysterious energy doesn’t have to be kept in the ice crystal Shield. The ice crystals can indeed effectively prevent the mysterious energy from spreading, but the bad thing is ... The space required is too large! If you killed a superhuman while you were out, would you use this ice crystal Shield to store your mysterious energy? That’s impossible!”

Li Hao nodded in agreement.

Not bad!

One of the three suns could extract about 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy. Who would bring an ice crystal Shield of 1000 cubic meters with them to kill a three sun?

“It’s the same for your extraction of mysterious energy. ”

Mu Sen continued to explain,”for example, this time, you obtained 32 cubes of mysterious energy. Are you only able to absorb it here?” “Every Martial Master and super doesn’t want their cultivation process to be seen by others, so they have their own ways of extracting and taking it away!”

Li Hao’s interest was piqued, and he hurriedly asked,”director, how do we extract it?” What item can I use to prevent the mysterious energy from spreading?”

He was also thinking that if he were to absorb it here, there would be many people outside. In fact, it would not be secretive at all.

If he finished it in a short while, wouldn’t he be telling others that he was different?

“You’ll know soon!”

Mu Sen chuckled. His smile was a little profound.”In the past, the Silver City could not retrieve it. But now ... We can!”

A moment later, the two of them arrived within the ice Barrier.

More than 100 mysterious energy of various attributes.

There was also a portion that had no attributes!

Mu Sen said,”you can choose 32 cubes. What attribute it is ... Or no attribute it doesn’t matter!” The non-elemental ones are easier to absorb, and the elemental ones are more explosive, but they can easily absorb energy into the body to break the shackles and become supers. ”

Li Hao’s visit this time was because of the five elements.

The earth energy from the last time had helped him modify his spleen.

This time, apart from the fire element supers, there were also metal, wood, water, and earth supers, but there was no fire. This was because the fire element supers did not come this time, and it was not convenient to attack on a rainy night. Using fire on a rainy night would be twice the effort with half the result, and their combat power would be weakened.

As for the others, they were wind and lightning attributes. Those that could fly were also wind attributes.

“It’s missing the fire energy ... According to the five elements, the fire energy corresponds to the heart. In other words, if the five elements can strengthen the five internal organs this time, the heart will not be strengthened.”

Li Hao glanced at it and quickly said,””Director, I want to extract 8 cubic meters of gold, wood, and water elemental energy and 6 cubic meters of earth energy.”

Since he had absorbed two cubes of earth energy last time, Li Hao felt that he should balance it out.

As for the fire energy, he didn’t have it right now, so he had two choices left. Li Hao thought for a moment and said,””Lightning energy, wind energy, one each.”

Mu Sen was not surprised at all. He only reminded,””Absorbing elemental energy can indeed help you become a super, but it needs to be matched! If you were of the fire attribute, you could easily suffer a backlash and even lose your life once you absorb the water attribute’s elemental energy!”


Chapter 187: Breaking a hundred (2)
Translator: 549690339
It was normal for Li Hao to need energy of different attributes.

This was because it was best to match one’s own attributes when drawing energy into one’s body in order to activate the Super Lock.

However, there was no way to investigate this thing. He could only try it bit by bit.

Li Hao wanted too many attributes at once, and it was easy to waste them ... Of course, Li Hao decided not to participate in this.

Li Hao nodded,”Secretary, I know!” If the situation doesn’t look right, I’ll give up!”

“Yes, I believe you won’t be that foolish ... However, you’re focused on absorbing attribute characteristics. Are you giving up on the progress of martial arts?”

He was still a little regretful,’your teacher has now entered the thousand warrior level and is a legend among the martial masters! I originally thought that you would choose to absorb the attribute-less mysterious energy and, like your teacher, walk a bit further on the path of a Martial Master. It seems ... You don’t seem to care too much about this. ”

Li Hao said honestly,”director, I haven’t practiced martial arts for long!” It’s only been three years, and it’s only been a few days since I started learning it as a martial artist ... It’s the same as becoming a superpower, and it’s faster, so I still hope to become one as soon as possible!”

Mu Sen nodded again and did not try to persuade him.

Yes, Li Hao had only been learning martial arts for a short time. It was understandable that he chose to become a superpower.

“You’d better enter the tenth severing stage before advancing to become a super. This way, you’ll have a chance to cross over to the Starlight Stage ... Of course, that depends on the situation. After all, entering the tenth severing stage also requires time. ”

Liu Long had never reported Li Hao’s matter.

Thus, mu Sen didn’t know about Li Hao’s situation. As for Li Hao’s share of the mysterious energy this time, Liu Long didn’t give any reason. Mu Sen asked, but Liu Long only said that Li Hao’s contribution was great as bait.

As for the fact that Li Hao had killed the Super and the 100-plus martial masters, only a few people in the team knew about it.

Thus, even now, mu Sen did not know that Li Hao had entered the tenth slash realm, or even was close to breaking through a hundred.

In everyone’s eyes, Li Hao was just an ordinary person.

Perhaps after absorbing the mysterious energy, he would be able to enter the Starlight realm or the tenth realm a little faster ... As for the rest, no one thought too deeply about it, as it was still too early.

Li Hao, on the other hand, naturally made a fortune in silence.

There was no need to publicize this!

If no one knew about it, he would have the chance to sneak attack them. If everyone knew about it, how could he sneak an attack on them?

“Director, what should I use to extract this mysterious energy?”

Mu Sen did not speak. He walked to the side and took out a long white strip from a glass cabinet. Li Hao did not recognize it at first.

But soon, Li Hao’s expression changed.

Human bones!

As expected, mu Sen smiled and said,”use this!” Of course, remember to return it after you’re done! Things with ordinary mysterious energy couldn’t be preserved. Other than ice crystals, the easiest thing to preserve was actually the human body ... Of course, not everyone could do it! They need to be at least at the glorious sun realm. Their bone armor can contain the compressed mysterious energy!”

This time, he had killed a sun glory and three suns, which was why Silver City had this kind of thing.

No wonder mu Sen had said that there was no way before.

“The bone armor of these Warriors can compress the mysterious energy. Otherwise, even the Warriors would be blown up! Actually, even their skin can be preserved ... But the two who died this time were cut into pieces by your teacher. The bones are still there, but the skin ... Forget it!”

Li Hao’s face turned pale, and he looked a little disgusted.

“Are you afraid?” mu Sen smiled.

Li Hao said embarrassedly,”no, I’m not afraid. It’s just ... Just a little ... Chief, can we only use this?”

“You can use other things, such as extraordinary items. Do you have any?”

He laughed.”With the Silver City’s current conditions, it’s already good enough that there’s something that contains mysterious energy. You’re being picky.” Your teacher’s mysterious abilities are even more exaggerated. They were preserved with the head of that three yang!”

Li Hao’s face turned even paler. He gritted his teeth and looked as if he was not afraid of death.

Mu Sen looked at him and sighed in his heart.

He was too young!

Just like the young men on the night patrol, Li Hao had not seen much of the world. Even though he was Yuan Shuo’s student, he had never practiced martial arts before. As expected, he was still very wary of these bloody things.

He said nothing more and began to extract the mysterious energy according to Li Hao’s request.

Eight cubic meters of metal, wood, water, six cubic meters of earth energy, one cubic meter of wind and one cubic meter of Thunder.

It was not just one bone. He had used six bones to place them separately.

After a while, he put the six bones into a small black bag and handed it to Li Hao.””After returning, slowly absorb it! Don’t be anxious! When you finish absorbing it, send it back. These things can still be used next time. There are too few things in the Silver City that can store the mysterious energy!”

After saying that, he added,”only a few people know about this information. Don’t disclose it to outsiders to avoid trouble!” 32 cubic meters of mysterious energy could be sold for tens of millions in the black market! To many people, this amount of money is enough to make them ignore everything!”

“Thank you for your reminder, Secretary!”

Li Hao thanked him and walked out with the small black bag, his face pale.

……

A moment later, Li Hao disappeared from the warehouse.

After a while, Liu Yan also arrived.

When he saw mu Sen, he nodded his head slightly. Mu Sen also laughed. After thinking for a moment, he said,”Just now, that little fellow Li Hao took his share. Your demon hunting squad can give him an appropriate amount of training! Since we’re already in this field, we need to broaden our horizons. He’s too timid. He was so scared by a human bone that his face turned pale. If I don’t let him go, he’ll pee his pants ...”


Chapter 188: Breaking a hundred (3)
Translator: 549690339
Liu Yan’s eyes were extremely strange.

He looked at mu Sen and nodded his head with difficulty after a long while.”Good! He’s a cultured man, a scholar who has never seen blood before. It’s normal!”

In his heart, he was cursing madly!

That kid was not a good person.

Lying again!

He peed his pants when he saw human bones?

I was so scared that I almost peed my pants. The way I killed that Water-type superhuman ... I can’t even explain it.

Just this?

And he was so scared of human bones that his legs went soft?

Who are you trying to fool?

Liu Yan had never seen through it before, but now she knew that this was Li Hao’s disguise. That brat was evil, bold, cold-blooded, and perverted. Whoever believed him would die the most miserable death!

She did not say much to mu Sen. It was a good thing.

It was best that no one knew!

If everyone knew that Li Hao was evil and a pervert, they might not have made it back alive. That guy must be evil to be able to kill two experts.

“He’s a scholar!”

Mu Sen sighed with emotion,”Yuan Shuo is a fake scholar, but he has really taught a scholar!” I don’t know how Li Hao sees him now. He was a weak professor before, but he’s suddenly turned into a murderous devil!”

He was flustered for Li Hao.

Liu Yan smiled stiffly and quickly changed the topic.””Secretary, I’m here to retrieve something!”

Don’t talk nonsense!

And what would Li Hao think?

Don’t you worry!

He was worried that Yuan Shuo would not be able to accept that his student was a murderer!

Mu Sen did not say anything more. He led Liu Yan inside with a smile and chatted with the young woman. He liked her the most. Unfortunately, Liu Yan was a thorny rose. He only talked to her for fun. If she really stuck to him, he would not dare to accept her.

……

At the same time.

Li Hao didn’t go home. Instead, he went straight to the Silver City ancient Academy.

At this time, it was safer to stay with his teacher.

If there were any problems during the absorption, his teacher might have a way to solve it.

……

In the yuan family’s courtyard.

Yuan Shuo had also returned. There were not many supers around the Silver City, and he had run around and killed a few. He did not know if there were any more, but even if there were, they would quickly disappear once they learned of the others ‘deaths.

Now, he had no one to protect him, so he didn’t need it.

Hu Hao, Li Meng, and the others, who had received the new five birds book, couldn’t wait to practice it and didn’t have time to come here. Moreover, Yuan Shuo didn’t want anyone to watch him, so he sent them away.

When Li Hao arrived, the courtyard was very cold.

It was almost 12 o’ clock at night, but the lights were still on. In the past two days, not many people in Silver City could sleep well.

“Teacher!”

Li Hao saw Yuan Shuo in the living room. At this moment, Yuan Shuo was eating something. Only then did Li Hao feel hungry, as if he had not eaten for a day and a night.

“Want to eat a little?”

“Thank you, teacher!”

Li Hao didn’t stand on ceremony. He sat down and began to eat, his mouth full of oil.

Yuan Shuo didn’t look refined when he ate either. He chuckled as he watched Li Hao eat, his eyes showing a rare gentleness. He was old, old, and injured. He was preparing to retire and return to the fields to nurture a student so that he could inherit his wealth of knowledge.

There were too many ancient books in his head, and the original books had been destroyed by him.

If he died like this, these ancient books would be completely lost, and that would be a pity.

He had planned to pass all this knowledge to Li Hao in a few years. Li Hao wasn’t a martial arts inheritor he had chosen, but an inheritor of knowledge.

The new book of five birds only made Li Hao a little healthier.

Who knew that Li Hao would become a Martial Master in the end?

As for himself, it was a blessing in disguise. Because of his injury, he had taken in this student and stepped into the Qian dynasty.

He was actually very satisfied with this student.

It was a pity that he might be busy from now on. His head was filled with ancient books and he might not have much time to teach this student.

At the thought of this, Yuan Shuo felt a little regretful.

“Little Hao!”

“Yes.”

Li Hao gnawed on the chicken leg and raised his head to look at his teacher.

Yuan Shuo was all smiles.”Don’t go home for the time being. I’ll be busy from now on. I’ll find some time to teach you some things at night. It may not be useful now, but in the future ... It may be of great use!”

For example, the blood Blade technique, the five birds technique, and the breathing technique ...

Yuan Shuo had actually learned a lot of things from ancient books. He had also made some changes to make them more suitable for modern martial masters to cultivate.

And this was only the tip of the iceberg!

In the past, he had thought that many other things were just conjectures and fantasies of the ancient people.

But looking at it now, was that really the case?

Yuan Shuo also had a great idea. He wanted to connect the ancient books and see if he could create a new path for martial arts.

Some of the records in the ancient books had already been broken.

It didn’t matter!
He could restore it bit by bit and modify it bit by bit. The original five birds technique wasn’t the entire chapter and was restored by him. It was quite good to cultivate now.

However, it might take a long time.

Li Hao nodded and did not refuse.

He had always been so obedient.

“Then, from tonight onwards ...”

“Not tonight!”

Li Hao hurriedly said,”I’m going to absorb mysterious energy tonight. Teacher, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but among the mysterious energy, elemental mysterious energy can be separated. One part can be separated into elemental mysterious energy, and the other part can be separated into elemental mysterious energy!” Attribute-less mysterious energy can strengthen the body, while attribute-based mysterious energy can strengthen the internal organs ... Of course, I’m not too sure, but I’ve previously split the earth energy and strengthened the spleen!”
Chapter 189: Breaking a hundred (4)
Translator: 549690339
Yuan Shuo was slightly stunned.

He really didn’t notice this!

“Are you sure?”

“En!”

“Of course,” Li Hao added.”It needs the energy of the small sword to work. Otherwise, it won’t work!”

Yuan Shuo took it seriously and muttered,””The mysterious energy can strengthen the five internal organs? For martial masters, when they were at the tenth realm and the hundred realm, they only strengthened their bones and muscles. Only when they reached the thousand warrior realm would they change their blood, and through the change of blood, it would nourish their internal organs! However, this process will be very long!”

He felt a little strange. Didn’t the mysterious energy devour inner strength?

Of course, he didn’t feel anything when he was absorbing it. However, when he had the mysterious source, he realized that it could devour inner strength.

But now, Li Hao said that it could be used to strengthen the internal organs.

Didn’t that mean ... He could take a shortcut?

Why was it like this?

What was the difference between this and absorbing the mysterious energy directly?

What was the function of the small sword?

Many thoughts flashed through his mind. He looked at Li Hao and mumbled,””At the level of a warrior of thousands, other than the divine decree, the most important thing is the strengthening of one’s internal organs. Only then can one be considered a true God of the land! Otherwise, even douqian and some poisons could kill him! If the internal organs aren’t strong enough, the external tendons, bones, and skin will be linked, and the internal Qi will be trained ... It will be difficult to strengthen the internal organs with this breath!”

“You’re going to absorb the mysterious energy to strengthen your internal organs?”he asked again after a moment of silence.

“Yes, I have this plan!”

Li Hao nodded and said,”teacher, I think that dual-training might have a better effect!” It was more comprehensive! Otherwise, once you fight, your inner strength will be shaken and your internal organs may be injured. This is one of the reasons why many martial masters have internal injuries. ”

There were almost no martial masters who were not injured. If they were not injured, it could only mean one thing-you were a fake Martial Master who did not fight!

“Alright!”

Yuan Shuo nodded,”if possible, of course I’ll strengthen my internal organs!” We can’t do it because we can ‘t. If there’s a way ... We must strengthen your internal organs before your sword’s energy is exhausted!”

“If you can succeed, it will be of great help to your future!”

“I’m only afraid that the energy in the sword is too little and not enough for you. ”

As for himself, he didn’t want to use it because he could feel that if he used it, the energy would be gone after strengthening it a little.

Since that was the case, he might as well let Li Hao use it to build a good foundation.

“Stop eating!”

Seeing that Li Hao was still in the mood to eat, Yuan Shuo rudely lifted him up.”What are you eating for? if I had known that you had business to attend to, I wouldn’t have let you eat!”

Li Hao didn’t mind and continued eating. He chewed up the chicken in his mouth and swallowed it all. Only then did he feel satisfied.

……

Yuan Shuo’s house had a huge training room.

When the weather was good, he would practice martial arts in the yard.

When the weather was bad, he would practice martial arts at home.

Throwing Li Hao onto the cushion, Yuan Shuo quickly said,””Hurry up and start. Let me see how you absorb it!”

“Teacher!”

Li Hao immediately said,”there’s no hurry, teacher. I feel like I’m about to break through 100. But what does it mean?” What were the characteristics of breaking through 100? What do I need to pay attention to when I cross this level?”

He didn’t even know about these things!

Yuan Shuo was taken aback ... Only then did he come back to his senses. He sighed with emotion. Although he kept saying that Li Hao’s score was about to break 100, he still couldn’t help but sigh when he realized that Li Hao’s score was really about to break 100.

When did he break a hundred?

He had started practicing martial arts at a young age, entered the ten decapitation realm in his teens, broke through a hundred in his twenties, and reached the peak of the hundred-breakthrough realm in his forties. He had swept through the martial arts world in Silver Moon province and become an Overlord.

For the next 30 years, he had been trying to break into the universe of thousand fighters and only succeeded today.

But Li Hao ...

The rise of mystics and superpowers was actually a good thing for martial masters. At least now that they had mysterious powers, it was easier to strengthen themselves!

As this thought flashed through her mind, she felt guilty for not teaching Li Hao these things.

As a warrior of thousands of fighters, it would be embarrassing if his last disciple did not know martial arts!

“Cut ten, break a hundred, I told you before, it’s a pure strength system! When it comes to thousand combat, it involves the spiritual level, which is what we often call divine intent! That’s why it’s the easiest to identify a warrior!”

“When you’ve severed Ten Realms, you’ll produce inner strength and your bones and muscles will ring together. At this time, it means that you’ve entered the ranks of a true Martial Master! “As for inner strength, you can obtain it through daily cultivation methods and secret Arts ... Now, there’s another way. Absorbing mysterious energy, which has no attributes, can also strengthen your body and allow you to quickly produce inner strength. However, it could also be a serious injury, a double-edged sword. You have to figure it out yourself!”

“The process of severing Ten Realms is a process of strengthening inner strength! The stronger the inner strength, the stronger the body. This is the same!”

“And over 100 ... In the past, when a true combat force breaks 100, using the battlefields as a symbol, breaking 100 soldiers is breaking 100! But in modern times, we don’t care about these things, because it’s hard to find an Army of 100 people who don’t carry firearms to fight you!”

“Therefore, at this time, realm is realm, and actual combat is actual combat!”

Li Hao listened attentively and kept nodding.

“Breaking 100 is a sign, release your inner strength!”

Li Hao was stunned. Release?

Yuan Shuo continued,”the human body has a sealing effect on both mysterious energy and inner strength!” When you can release your inner strength and pass through your body to protect yourself and hurt your enemies, you’ll have broken through the 100th level!”

Chapter 190: Chapter 46-breaking a hundred (5)
Translator: 549690339
“Release ... Teacher, how do we release it?”

Yuan Shuo explained,”I’m not saying that I’m going to do anything on purpose. It’s just a natural reaction of the body!” “When your inner strength has reached the 100th level, it will naturally be released and break through a barrier. Your physical fitness will improve, and your inner strength will become stronger. That’s enough!”

It sounded very simple, but in fact ... Li Hao felt that it was very simple. It was an external release. Understood!

“There are also strong and weak people who break through 100. How do you distinguish them?”

Li Hao asked again.

Yuan Shuo continued,”breaking through 100? in the traditional world of martial masters, we are generally divided into beginner, intermediate, advanced, and perfection!” This also corresponded to the waning moon, Half Moon, and full moon of moon underworld Masters ... In fact, above the full moon, before stepping into the glorious sun, there was still the full moon, which was equivalent to the completion of over 100 martial masters. A full moon would result in a loss, and it was actually the same for a Martial Master who had broken through a hundred perfection! If you’re still unable to advance after reaching the full circle or full moon level, then you’ll go downhill!”

If the moon was full, it would be a loss, and if the water was full, it would overflow.

When one reached the peak of the Dark Moon realm and broke through 100, they were still unable to advance. If they continued to stagnate at this stage, it would be the beginning of a decline.

Yuan Shuo had once stayed at this level for a long time. He had a deep feeling that if one did not rush up quickly at this level, one would end up like him. If not for a chance encounter, one would end up at the end of his life!

The current Liu Long was also trying to break through to this level. He had barely reached this level, but if he was unable to continue breaking through, he would not be far from falling!

“Teacher,” Li Hao said thoughtfully,”then how do we distinguish the early stage from the middle stage?”

“Simple!”

Yuan Shuo explained,”when a Martial Master breaks through a hundred, they can release their inner strength only in the four limbs!” The four limbs are the easiest to release. Completing the release of inner strength in all four limbs means that you have completed the initial stage of cultivation! One of the characteristics of the middle stage is the body. Every part of the body can be completely released ... Except for the head!”

“In the later stages, you will be able to release your inner force from your head to your entire body. At this point, if you can even use your inner force to hit someone with your head ... It means that your body has been trained to an extreme! At this time, you are in the late stage!”

“Then what about perfection?” Li Hao blinked.

“Perfect?”

Yuan Shuo laughed,”the perfection level is when you come into contact with divine decree!” “The realm of perfection is still a little mysterious to you. Simply put, when you feel as if you have a pair of heavenly eyes, you will have the ability to sense danger. Sometimes, you will even feel that there is someone behind you and see behind you ... Or, you can look inside yourself and your internal organs ... At this time, you will come into contact with the divine intent and reach perfection! This is the first stage of entering the thousand warrior realm. ”

Li Hao understood!

At this moment, he finally had a direct understanding of the cultivation system of a Martial Master.

The tenth realm only required the cultivation of inner strength and the physical body.

Breaking through the hundred realms, releasing inner strength.

Once the four limbs were fully extended, it would be the initial stage.

The torso was complete, and that was the middle stage.

If there were no weaknesses on the entire body, that would be the late stage.

Perfection meant that one could look into the body, sense danger, and come into contact with divine intent.

“Captain Liu, are you at the great circle stage?”

Li Hao asked again.

“No, but it can be counted!” Yuan Shuo shook his head.

“What do you mean?”

“He mainly relied on the mysterious energy to accumulate. It’s no problem for him to pass the late-hundred-stage, but he knows nothing about the divine decree! It was just that the accumulation of inner strength had exceeded the late stage. All martial masters nowadays had such a problem! Thus, if Liu Long wanted to step into the thousand warrior realm ... The chances were not high, unless he could come into contact with the divine intent! This guy doesn’t cultivate the will of the gods. In the end, he’ll either become a super or stay at the peak of the 100th level for the rest of his life!”

“Is there no other way?” Li Hao frowned.

“There are!”

Yuan Shuo laughed again,”martial masters are actually the most difficult to break through!” Can you guess how I came into contact with the divine decree?”

The first few stages weren’t too difficult.

The only thing that was truly difficult was to come into contact with divine intent.

Li Hao didn’t understand, but he knew that his teacher definitely did ... Because he had cheated.

“Teacher, How did you come into contact with it?”

“Train your martial arts, your will, your heart, and your source!”

Li Hao was confused. He didn’t understand.

Yuan Shuo sighed. ‘You brat, you don’t seem to be very smart. Forget it, seeing that you haven’t been exposed to martial arts for long, I’ll explain in more detail.'”Take the ‘new book of five birds’ as an example. In order to break through to the completion of the 100 levels, I once lived in the mountains for three years! I’ve been observing the true characteristics of Tigers, deers, bears, apes, and birds every day! Learn everything about them, imitate everything about them ... Remember, just imitate them, don’t really want to be the same as them!”

“Humans are humans, and beasts are beasts ... We need to grasp the divine intent in this! For example, the Tiger’s pounce ... Why is it so pouncing, why is it able to accurately hit the enemy’s vital point in one shot ... How does the deer predict the Tiger’s attack ... In short, this process is quite profound!”

Yuan Shuo laughed.”This is something that only those who understand it can do. Those who don’t ... There’s nothing we can do about it. It just means that they really don’t have the talent!”

Li Hao’s interest was piqued.”Teacher, that Captain Liu practices the ‘nine tribulations force’. He’s not imitating the five beasts. If he wants to make a breakthrough, how can he comprehend the divine intent in it?”

“This is actually an analysis of the source of martial arts secret techniques! Take the ninth-form force as an example. You have to think about how the person who created it created it. What was the essence of the ninth-refinement force? How could he do nine-fold at once? I’ve never cultivated it before, so I can’t say it. He has cultivated it before, and he has even cultivated it to this level. Does he not have any comprehension at all? It’s not wrong to pursue the improvement of strength, but it’s very difficult for you to cross realms with pure strength!”
