        , who hadn't advanced in rank all this time, was now at the early three yang realm.
         Hu Hao, Li Meng, and yunyao had also improved significantly, especially Li Meng. Previously, he had only been at full moon, but now, he had also entered the sun glory realm.
         When he left, he did leave some divine power stones for the little tree to release some energy for everyone to cultivate.
         He didn't expect the effect to be so good.
         Hao lianchuan laughed and said,"cultivating here is very beneficial for us supers!" Because of the mysterious energy's dominance, the superpowers have too many hidden injuries. Even if the energy you provided previously has some healing effects and the hidden injuries are much better, the mysterious energy is still very domineering ... Cultivating here feels warm and even feels like the life force I used up is recovering ..."
         At this moment, little tree's spirit fluctuated.""These people have overdrawn their potential! "Especially this fatty. He's overdrawn his potential. People of your era are very special. There seems to be some kind of seal in your body that seals off your potential and protects you. However, these martial masters who walk the path of energy are slightly different ... Life force can help them recover some life force ... But I can only release some life force now. I can't help them completely recover."
         Li Hao understood!
         Superpowers overdrafted too much potential. Under such circumstances, overdrafting one's potential was actually overdrafting one's vitality.
         He would die sooner or later!
         The powerhouses of the ancient civilization could live for a long time. After forging a golden body, it was not a problem to live for a thousand years. However, martial masters and superpowers were far from being able to achieve this.
          In fact, he could sense it from his own life force.
         A Martial master's divine intent was too strong, and it was actually also wearing down the physical body.
         The mysterious power of the superpower was too overbearing and had been overdrawing.
         That was why people nowadays cultivated very quickly, and their strength was actually very strong. However, this kind of sudden outburst would inevitably cause some losses, such as the length of one's life.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He took out a wood-type origin weapon and 10000 divine power stones and teleported to the root of the small tree."These are the rewards!"
         Little tree swayed his body and seemed to be in a good mood.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Although the divine power stones were not much, it was not bad to have a large number of them.
         As for the divine weapon, the wood-type divine weapon should have been a part of the monster plant's body back then, and it could help it recover a little.
         Although it had cut off some Origin Energy, at the current stage, the origin Energy was not of much help to it. What it lacked more was energy.
         The power of origin was a matter for the future.
         Moreover, as long as there was enough energy, it could also be restored.
         At this moment, Li Hao suddenly threw out a lot of things. Including the wind chimes, the gloves, and nine divine weapons, there were 11 origin divine weapons in total, and this did not include the one he had just given to little tree.
         Little tree was a little surprised!
         Although the grades of the weapons were not too high, it was still surprised to see so many of them.
         "How much spring of life can these be exchanged for?"
          "Give me a number," Li Hao looked at little tree.  Little tree was a little dazed. After a long time, he said with a mental fluctuation,""Are you sure ... You want to let me absorb it? These divine weapons must not have been easy to obtain for you. Furthermore, some of them are actually of good quality ..."
         In addition to the one he had now, he had 12 divine weapons.
         Li Hao had already used a few of them.
         In fact, during this period of time, Li Hao had obtained quite a lot of these things.
         Currently, he had left behind very few. For example, the giant chariot divine boat. These all had special uses. As for the others, he had already comprehended the wooden sword force. He did not really want to comprehend the origin Dao.
         As such, he wanted to obtain the spring of life even more.
         This thing had a great advantage over a sword. No matter how badly you were injured, even if you lost an arm or a leg, it could regrow it.
         He still had one drop ... But Li Hao didn't think it was enough.
         He needed more spring of life!
         "These divine weapons ... If I absorb and digest all of them, I can gather more energy if they're made from monster plants. For monster beasts, it's slightly worse ... How about ten drops of life essence?"
         Li Hao looked at little tree. Little tree had said that one drop cost 10000 divine power stones. It was hard to estimate the value of an origin god weapon, but it didn't seem to be worth 10000 divine power stones at this stage.
         It depended on the grade.
         For example, the so-called heavenly Dao ruler in the central region. Even if it was 100000, the night patrolman would not hand it over to the Yama, let alone 10000.
         However, he seemed to have heard little tree's guilty conscience ... It was obvious that he couldn't have condensed only ten drops out of eleven origin God weapons. This guy must have earned a lot from the price difference!
          That was normal. The small tree also hoped that he could recover.
         Li Hao pondered for a moment and said, 15 drops! I've read in ancient books that the ancient kings even built a lake of life during their time ..."
         "It's not on the same level. Don't think too much about it." The small tree swayed and sent a mental wave.
         As you know, that's the human King.
         " 15 drops isn't too much, right?"
         The sapling pondered for a moment before fluctuating again,""Good! However, do you really want to melt all of these?"
         "Right!"
         Li Hao didn't hesitate."These things are just external objects. I have the starry sky sword, and now I have wind chasing boots. These are not very useful to me. I still lack a defensive divine weapon. The Black Tortoise in heaven battling city is in line with my expectations ... The others are not so good!"
         “……”
         Little tree didn't say anything. At this moment, heaven battling city didn't know what Li Hao was thinking. Otherwise, the old turtle would probably be surprised."You actually have your eyes on me?"
        
         Li Hao's thoughts were simple.
         One for attack, one for defense, and one for escape. Three weapons were enough.
         The starry sky sword, the Windchaser boots, the Black Tortoise seal, or the Black Tortoise shield were all the choices he had in mind.
         As for the others, even the wind chimes of the Samsara King, he didn't care too much about them. Otherwise, he wouldn't have kept using them.
         Thinking of this, Li Hao suddenly took out two weapons. One of them was the bronze mirror he had obtained from Qiao Feilong. He had always been wearing it, and it had the effect of concealing one's aura.
         One of them was the long saber that he had obtained after killing hai Sha.
         The quality was very good, and the starry sky sword didn't break it.
         "Senior tree, do you recognize these two divine weapons?"
         The sapling observed for a while, and the long saber only looked at it casually for a while before explaining,""This is a divine weapon forged in the later stage of the new martial era. Its quality is very good. It's not forged by monstrous beasts or monster plants, but by superb skills and powerful forging methods! The quality of this blade is not bad. "
         However, that was all.
          Li Hao understood.
         Little tree looked at the bronze mirror again, and after a long time, he sent out a mental message,""This thing ... I'm not sure what it is, but it's still in the stage of being sealed. It might ... It might be ... An imitation of some ultimate treasures?"
         It tried to recall the old tree's memories. The old tree had many memories, and the names of some treasures appeared in his mind: "Back then, the number one mirror-type treasure was the heaven peeking mirror ... But it was broken. Omniscient and omnipotent! The second mirror-type treasure was the sea-stabilizing divine mirror, which was an imitation of the heaven-peeking mirror. It could suppress the forbidden Sea. However, some people say that the second mirror type Supreme treasure is the heaven seeking treasure mirror. This item can capture the life force of all living things. In the past, it collected the life force of all living things and displayed a stone tablet. It is the ranking of life force and the strength of experts ..."
         At this point, little tree hesitated."Your mirror ... Might have been made by imitating these Supreme treasures. Of course, almost all mirror-type Supreme treasures originated from the heaven peeking mirror. We can only know the details after unsealing it."
         "How do I unseal it?"
         Li Hao thought of the other divine weapon, the sword that he had given to the night patrolman, which had probably been taken away by hou Xiaochen.
         He had rarely seen sealed ancient divine weapons.
         This bronze mirror counted as one, the weapons of the eight great families counted, and the remaining one was that small sword.
         "Treasures conceal themselves. If no one uses them for a long time, they will naturally be sealed. Sometimes, they might not be sealed on purpose. As long as they are used for a long time and are nourished with energy, they will naturally open after a long time."
         Li Hao understood. Just say it, you won't be done.
         He could only rely on grinding!
         However, after confirming that it was something good, Li Hao was much more at ease.
         The small tree didn't say anything else. A wood-element origin weapon under its roots shattered instantly. It seemed to reveal a weapon soul, but it melted instantly.
         "Senior tree, these soldier souls ..."
         "They are all spirits of monster plants and monster beasts. It's good that they are broken. It's a relief ... In fact, these divine weapons were no longer made a long time ago. I didn't expect so many of them to be left ... Maybe the new divine weapons were taken away, leaving behind these old divine weapons in storage, so there are more of them."  New ones were rare. For example, Li Hao had a long saber.
         However, after thinking about it, armor could also be considered a new type of divine weapon.
         On the other hand, origin God weapons were probably scattered outside and used by non-systemic cultivators. It was easier for later generations to obtain them.
         One by one, the origin God weapons were shattered by the small tree. Some of them let out roars of beasts, while some other strange sounds could be heard. Gradually, the luster of the small tree seemed to start to brighten.
         A wave of force ... Or rather, spiritual energy, surged and grew stronger.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao frowned slightly.
         But at this moment, he still held back.
         ? The demon hunt squads were all here, and since he had already made this choice ... He could only passively wait for the results. After little tree recovered his strength, he would definitely be much more powerful than before ... But sometimes, how could he not take a gamble?
         Now that there were countless people outside staring at him, wanting to kill him and eat him, he would take a gamble here!
         One, two, three ...
         Gradually, the divine weapon was completely destroyed.
         The divine power Stone shattered quickly and the small tree seemed to have grown much taller. Before, it was only the height of a man. Compared to the collapsed tree, it was just a small sapling. Now, it had grown to five or six meters tall.
         In the trunk, a crystal-like energy was flowing rapidly.
         Li Hao could clearly feel that the space of the ruins seemed to have expanded a little. The darkness in the surroundings dissipated a little, as if they were expanding their territory.
          After a while, the divine power stones were all broken.
         The origin God weapons had all disappeared.
         At this moment, there seemed to be a face on the trunk of the small tree.
         He couldn't see her face clearly, only an outline.
         A mental energy fluctuation came again,""You're very bold. "
         Yes, it was very big!
         Li Hao said calmly,"it's a win-win situation. If you kill me, no one will help you, senior!" I've also seen the results of senior's cooperation with me. In just a few days, I dare say that the treasures I've collected ... There aren't many people in the world who can take them out, let alone the powers! And those who were willing to let seniors absorb them were even fewer! As for me, I have enemies all over the world, and everyone wants to kill me ... I want to kill them too, so it's easiest for people like me to obtain some treasures!"
         His enemies were all over the world!
         As soon as he said that, the small tree also swayed slightly.
         In his heart, he felt a little strange.
        
         The geniuses of these eras all liked to make enemies. It was as if the experts who rose up in all eras had enemies all over the world!
         That's true. If they wanted to rise and become stronger, they would naturally infringe on the interests of many people and offend many people. In turn, these people would be resources that promoted their growth.
         "You're right ... I can give you the essence of life ..."
         After saying that, the energy in little tree's body surged, and a special wave of life force spread out. At this moment, Li Hao and the others felt as if they had been cleansed.
         Little tree didn't break his promise.
         That was because Li Hao was right. If they were too greedy for today's gains and were unwilling to condense the spring of life for Li Hao, there would be no next time. There was no need to lose more for a small gain.
         Even if it condensed 15 drops for Li Hao ... In fact, it wouldn't consume too much energy. It still had at least 70% of the energy from the divine weapon it had obtained this time!
         Compared to before, when he had only managed to push Li Hao back, little tree was actually much more powerful.
         After a while, drops of the spring of life floated toward Li Hao.""This item can not be stored in ordinary items. It's best to store it in energy crystals ..."
         "What's that?"
          "It's the fragments of the divine power Stone that you mentioned. Just forge it into a bottle ..."
         Li Hao understood. He reached out his hand, and a pile of fragments gathered on the ground. A fierce tiger appeared in Li Hao's heart. A flame rose and instantly melted. Then, a large can appeared.
         “……”
         The small tree was a little dazed.
         I've only condensed 15 drops for you. You can just make a small bottle. Why did you make a big jar?
         Li Hao was thinking even more. He had 15 drops now, and with the one he had, he had 16 drops.
         There would only be more and more of these things.
         For example, the mysterious energy and the divine power Stone. In the past, the mysterious energy was a treasure. Now that he had killed the rising light, he was too lazy to extract anything, and the same was true for the divine power Stone ...
         What was so special about the spring of life?
         "It's nothing more than getting more good things for the small tree to absorb. Then ... I'll naturally have more spring of life and won't need to forge anymore.
         Sooner or later, he would have to collect a full jar!
         He also wanted to try the taste of taking a bath in the spring of life.
         15 drops of the spring of life fell into the jar. Like crystals, they rolled around in the jar, making it look exceptionally beautiful.
         Li Hao smiled.
         16 drops!
         Every drop could save a life. A heavy injury caused by the light sword could be healed with just one drop. If it was not for the breaking of the superpower lock, the injury might have been completely healed!
         What did this mean?
         It meant that he had 16 chances to save his life, which was simply a life-saving straw.
         The people outside wanted to kill him, but he wanted to kill them!
         I'll kill whoever kills me.
         Thinking of this, Li Hao spoke again."Senior, it's still the same as before. Are you willing to go out with me?"
         "No,"
         Li Hao was a little disappointed, but he didn't say anything.
         "Then, senior, please recover. I'm going out."
          Since he was not willing, then forget it.  Little tree seemed to be looking at Li Hao. After thinking for a while, he said with a mental wave,""I'll give you an origin talisman, just like before. However, now that I've recovered some of my strength, it'll be more powerful ... However, I have a request ..."
         Li Hao's heart moved. Stronger?
         He was able to kill a late-stage sunguang before, and now he was even stronger. How strong was he?
         "Senior, what request do you have? How lethal is it?"
         "It's not easy for me to judge the strength of the experts of your era. If they are only slightly stronger than you, then I can kill them! As for the request, it's very simple. I need a large amount of energy, a lot, a lot ... In the future, when you obtain energy, you can exchange it for life essence with me ... If you meet other people ... Or monster plants, don't forget that I'm the first one to cooperate with you ..."
         What did that mean?
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat."Senior, you mean ... There might be other existences from the ancient civilization era?" he asked.
         "I don't know about humans, but Fey plants ... Have long lifespans. Even if they're withered, there's a possibility that they'll be like me, reborn from their father's roots."
         "Don't worry." Li Hao understood."My first choice is, of course, senior!"
         "That's good!"
         "The one in heaven battling city is too powerful," the little tree said."The energy you provided me isn't even enough for him to revive a branch ... So, there's no need to find him."
         Li Hao finally understood!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com So, you're afraid that I'll go to General Huai?
         He nodded and didn't say much.
         Little tree, on the other hand, made a huge investment. He condensed another crystal-like root and floated it to Li Hao."Try not to use this thing as much as possible because it is the convergence of Origin Energy. I'm not sure if the current martial arts are compatible ... If you use it, I don't know what the consequences will be ... I also don't know if there is still a master in this world ... If there is no master, you can do whatever you want. If there is an owner, if he is not a powerful neo martial artist, he may be an enemy ... I'm not sure about the details, but you should use it wisely!"
         A few short sentences revealed a lot of information.
         Li Hao was moved, but he didn't say anything. He just nodded and put away the crystal root. This was probably the most powerful trump card he had ever obtained.
         He thought of the bomb thrown by the governor of Linjiang and wondered who was stronger.
         Even Hong Yitang's face was covered in dust from the explosion.
         Could this tree root ... Deal with those in the metamorphosis stage?
         Little tree's previous strength was only at the late-stage of the rising light realm. It was hard to say whether he could deal with a metamorphosized cultivator. After all, it was just an origin talisman and not little tree's body.
         No matter what, it was better than nothing.
         Li Hao didn't say anything else. He looked at everyone and said,""Let's go back. Everyone has gained something this time. I hope that everyone ... Will be able to enter the thousand warrior class soon!"
          If he didn't enter the thousand Warrior Guild, the demon hunt squad wouldn't be of much help to Li Hao.
         Only by entering the Qian dynasty would their internal organs be strengthened and they would soon improve again. Only then would they be of great help to Li Hao.
         No one said anything and just kept it in mind.
         Soon, the group of people jumped out of the ruins.
         After they left, the small tree was quiet for a moment. A moment later, the hole disappeared. The small tree chose to seal the place. This person probably wouldn't come back in a short time.
         The branches and leaves swayed as if they were looking at the palace not far away.
         This abandoned Palace ... Could its owner still come?
         p Perhaps ... It was impossible!  Was there really any meaning to her father's persistence?
         A moment later, these thoughts disappeared. 'I was originally a tree. Since I've taken root here, I'll stay here forever.'
        
         In the wilderness.
         The divine boat, which had been lying dormant on the ground, instantly disappeared and flew away.
         In the sky, Huang Yu was stunned.
         In the next moment, he also broke through the air.
         In the blink of an eye, a group of people appeared in the distance.
         Li Hao didn't look at anyone. The divine boat landed, and the team quickly entered the divine boat. There was still some distance to the cat head mountain. Even if they found it, they might not be able to find it.
         The next moment, the divine boat floated into the air and disappeared.
         Huang Yu's eyes flickered as he looked in the direction where the divine boat had disappeared.
         Had he been discovered, or had he set up a bewildering formation to prevent the enemy from ambushing him?
         No matter what ... This Li Hao had disappeared right under his nose. He was quite capable.
          ……
         Inside the divine boat.
         Inside the cabin.
         No one spoke, but Li Hao's voice resounded in the armor.""I'm in trouble. Recently, many people in the star dynasty want to kill me, and I don't want to just sit around and wait for death. I originally wanted to stay in Silver Moon for a while ... But I've attracted too many experts, which is not good for Silver Moon ... Although I don't want to hurt anyone, others want to kill me. So, I'm preparing to leave!"
         As soon as he said that, a large number of voices quickly sounded in the channel."Guild leader, we'll go with you!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Too weak!"
         Li Hao's one word silenced everyone.
         He was too weak!
         They knew that they were too weak.
         Currently, in the team, other than Liu Long and a few other supers, Li Heng was lucky enough to barely cross into the thousand warrior stage. The rest of the team had a few who had broken through to the hundred perfection stage, but this was far from enough!
         The difference was too great!
         Li Hao continued."I went out earlier and killed some people. Some late-stage and even peak-stage Sunglow realm experts ... I killed the son of Duke dingguo, the general of King Pingyuan, the younger brother of the stupa Mountain Master, one of the seven divine mountains, and the Grand Duke of King of North Sea, the number one Pirate of the North Sea ..."
         Li Hao laughed."Now that I've offended the three major organizations, the seven divine mountains will be here soon. If I don't leave now and stay in Silver Moon, perhaps someone in Silver Moon will be willing to protect me ... But why would I? After attracting so much trouble, in the end, I still have to owe a favor ... I'm most afraid of owing such a favor! If he attracted a large number of experts to attack Silver Moon and the people were plunged into misery and suffering ... That would be a sin. Even if I leave Silvermoon, I'll still be able to live the same life ... There are actually some people among you that I don't even know by name, but that's good ... I'm afraid that as time passes, I'll develop feelings for you and won't be able to leave you. "
         Let's do this!
         He was prepared to make these people stay.
         Stay in Silver Moon.
         Their future would not be too bad.
         As long as they passed the stage of thousand-player combat, they would become strong sooner or later. After their five internal organs were strengthened, they would know what they had gained from following Li Hao.
         In an instant, the entire cabin, including the channel inside the armor, was frighteningly quiet.
          "Guild leader ..."  Li Heng opened his mouth."I've broken through to the universe master level!"
         He had cheated!
         Besides, after he had entered the warrior power dimension, he also felt that he was still making rapid progress. He even felt that he was making progress faster than when he had broken through the 100th level. With his five internal organs strengthened, he could even start to walk on the path of the accumulating Supreme Dao stage.
         Even if he only had one force at the level of spirit accumulation, once he stepped into the level of spirit accumulation, he would be able to fight against three yang.
         "Yes."
         Li Hao nodded. Not bad.
         But ... So what if it was spirit accumulation?
         "When Minister hou left, he took the Wei Wu Army with him. Why can't the regiment commander take us with him?"
         Everyone looked at Li Hao.
         Li Hao also looked at them.
         Was it because of feelings?
         Not necessarily!
         They didn't spend that much time together. Perhaps it was admiration, perhaps it was worship, perhaps it was because they didn't want to miss the opportunity, but in any case, these people all showed their willingness to follow.
         They were willing to leave with Li Hao!
         Even if the future was difficult and dangerous.
         But shouldn't a Martial Master be like this?
         "Leader, our ten ring Mountain sealing array is very strong. If we all join forces and use the Qian warrior as the core, even if we can't defeat Xu Guang, we can at least kill the three suns ... Moreover, I believe that more people will enter the Qian warrior soon. By then, Xu Guang will be able to fight against them ... Even if he can't help leader kill the strong enemy, he can at least block and restrain them ..."
         Li Hao thought for a while and said,"you should stay!" We'll settle down for a while. Everyone's improved very quickly during this time ... But we don't have enough time to settle down. If we stay in Silver Moon, we can eliminate some of the small Pirates and the members of the three great organizations. "
          "I hope that by the time I return, everyone has already reached the warrior chiliarch realm. If there's no motivation from Silver Moon ... We can go to the three northern provinces. There's a war going on there. When I returned, I even saw some superhumans and martial masters fighting ..."
         When Kong Jie said that someone wanted to surround him, he had already made his decision.
         When hou Xiaochen left, he had the same thought.
         But at that time, he was not firm.
         When Kong Jie said that the whole world wanted to kill him ... Li Hao made up his mind. It was time for him to leave the land of Silver Moon. There were too many secrets buried here, but many of them were not something he could solve at this moment.
         It was not something he could take over.
         Heaven battling city, the martial arts university established by the eight great families, the other seven cities, the land of inheritance behind the stone gate, the eight trigrams in the sky, the Imperial Palace, the human King, the Stargate ...
         Too many secrets were hidden here, sealed here with the disappearance of the ancient civilization.
         He would be back.
         Silver City, that small city, the place where he grew up. His friends were still buried there. Although his parents 'graves were dug up, it was still his home.
        
         But at this moment, Li Hao knew that he should leave.
         Silver moon's men all had their own secrets and responsibilities.
         Li Hao didn't know what they were thinking.
         However, since they were hiding, it was obvious that there were still unfathomable and unrivaled enemies. Li Hao had no intention of forcing them to reveal their strength and trump cards for his sake.
         It was difficult to repay a favor.
         "By the way, you guys can also go to swords gate to take a look. Senior uncle Hong has the intention to build a Holy Land ..."
         "Sacred ground?" Hong Qing was stunned."What sacred ground?"
         "The Holy Land of the human world!"
         Hong Qing's mind wandered for a moment. What the hell?
         My father?
          Establish a Holy Land in the human world?
         Had the regiment commander gone crazy today?
         "You guys don't understand now, and I don't understand either, but I'll understand sooner or later."
         Li Hao mimicked the words of the old guys and laughed."The gap between you and me is getting bigger and bigger. I need to settle down, and you guys need to accumulate some things and experience some things ... It's not easy to open up martial uncle Hong's Pure Land. Many of them were from the swords gate, and they understood that it was not difficult to build a Saint land with a thousand people, but ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million ... It might be very difficult! I'm not too sure what's needed, but I do know that opening up such a place might be helpful to everyone. This is a journey to train one's heart. "
         Everyone looked at Li Hao. At this moment, they didn't have the time to think about Hong Yitang's grand plan.
         As her daughter, Hong Qing did not even think about this at the moment.
         He only knew that the Guild leader seemed to have made up his mind to leave.
         "Leader ... When we enter the warrior dimension, we will come to you ... Will you still accept us?"
         Li Hao smiled."There's no such thing as accepting or not accepting. You are now members of a demon hunt squad. You are also members of the heaven battling Army!"
         The heaven battling Army!
         With Zhan Tiangang, they were actually members of the heaven-battling Army.
         Everyone mulled over the meaning of his words, but Hong Qing did not say anything.
         "We'll look for you after we get into the chimeras," Liu Yan said."Wait for us in the central region ... Don't go too far. We won't be able to see you."
         "Hahaha, I hope so!"
         Li Hao laughed. Farewells were not necessarily sad, but farewells did make people feel a little disappointed.
         "When we reach Whitemoon city, you can go down ..."
          "What about us?" Hao lianchuan suddenly asked.  They were supers.
         Li Hao chuckled."Chief, have you forgotten that you're the head of the night patrollers? if you leave, what will happen to the night patrollers?"
         "Senior brother, I didn't ..."
         "I'm three suns!"Wang Ming said urgently.
         "You and the Head of the Department can stay here. Your strength has improved quite a bit, and the Head of the Department is about to shine ... I'm prepared to kill the White shark leader before I leave and cause chaos in the White shark Pirates ... You can use the White shark Pirates as training targets ... Of course, if I don't succeed, then forget it."
         "Zi Yue has been locked up in the inspection Office. In the current situation, director Kong and the others might not be willing to let me take Zi Yue away. They might not want to completely fall out with Ying Hongyue either ..."
         "What's there to be afraid of?"
         "Senior brother, I'll go to the patrol office later and kill that Zi Yue! It must be Hong Yue who caused you trouble!" Wang Ming shouted.
         "Forget it, I won't make things difficult for them."
         Li Hao laughed."A single Purple Moon won't affect much, so there's no need to turn hostile against Silver Moon and the others. They all have their own opinions, and I won't force them on my own. Of course, their opinions can't change my mind either."
         After thinking for a while, he looked at the crowd and finally looked at Liu Long,""Boss, I'll leave them to you. I'm not doing my job well as a guild leader ... If you want to quit, just return Black Phoenix. The rest is fine."
         Then, he knocked on the divine boat with his sword and said,""I know that you have a soldier soul! Right now, I'll pass your control over to my vice captain. The giant chariot divine boat is suitable for sea battles, and since I'm taking it with me, it won't be convenient for everyone to go out to sea, so I'll leave it to the demon hunt squads. "
         After hitting it for a while, the giant venomous ship trembled slightly. The next moment, Li Hao shot out a beam of sword Qi and pierced Liu Long's arm that was not wearing black armor. A drop of blood fell to the ground.
         A moment later, Liu Long slightly frowned and looked at Li Hao, but didn't say anything.
         The giant venomous ship was already under his control.
          Up ahead, they were about to reach white moon City.
         He looked ahead and continued,""If you have any trouble, you can look for uncle Hong or the light sword. Just say that I said I'll come back and help her completely suppress the power of light ... However, when you need help, she'll also need to help, or even help you hold the fort!"
         "People like Kong Jie and Huang Yu, Kong Jie has a straightforward personality and can be trusted a little. As for the rest ... Try to ignore them! In addition, I have a Senior Sister in the city, and her husband, Hu dingfang, is a military general. You should all know that ... Try not to deal with them. After I leave, even if they come looking for you, don't pay them any attention!"
         Li Hao explained everything, no matter how big or small.
         Liu Long listened quietly.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the past, Li Hao wouldn't have said these things. He might have left without thinking too much.
         But now, Li Hao was making arrangements for everyone.
         Future, future, future ...
         He was telling everything.
         "If you're lucky and obtain some divine power stones or origin divine weapons ... You can go to that place and ask that person to help you with your cultivation. It shouldn't refuse ... But remember, don't reveal the existence of this place to avoid any unnecessary trouble!"
        
         "If the boss is really in trouble ... And silver Moon can't stay here any longer, you can take everyone to heaven battling city to hide. You're an official member of the heaven battling Army, so it shouldn't be a problem. Once the gate opens, you can just enter directly."
         "Don't worry, I know. "
         At this moment, the White moon City had already appeared.
         Liu Long looked at the White moon City, and then at Li Hao.""You're not entering the city?"
         "Go. Otherwise, how can you sneak away quietly?"
         Li Hao laughed."Right, I won't leave any treasures for you. You can earn them yourself!"
         As they spoke, the divine boat flew past the White moon City and quickly landed at the Wei Wu army base.
         BOOM!
         The divine boat landed.
         A group of people disembarked from the ship, and Li Hao led them inside. While walking, he stuffed a small bottle into Liu Long's hand and said telepathically,""There's a drop of the spring of life in there, it's used to save lives ... Don't use it for cultivation. I'll take the rest with me. "
          Liu Long slightly nodded.
         "Are you planning to go to the central region or some other region?"
         "Go to the central region! Of course ... If the conditions allow it, I might go to the East first. "
         Yes, he might go to the East.
         To the Duke dingguo's mansion!
         There was still one Windchaser's boots that he had yet to get.
         Of course, he knew how dangerous it was.
         As for the wind-chasing boots, it was said that they were in the storage ring in the hands of the Duke dingguo. The Duke dingguo was extremely powerful and almost impossible to take away, but ... Maybe there was a chance?
         According to the light sword, the Xu family held an offering ceremony every year.
         They would take out the Windchaser's boots to worship their ancestors.
         Now, it was not the time to pay respects, but the eldest son of the Duke of dingguo had died. According to the rules, on the seventh day, he would be buried in the Leizu tomb, the ancestral hall would be opened, and the ancestors would be paid respects.
         At this moment, three days had passed since Xu Zhen's death.
         Going to the Duke dingguo's mansion also required time.
         It was a journey of nearly ten thousand miles.
         If Li Hao went all out, he wouldn't be slow. But even so, it would take him at least three days to get there. By the time he got there, it would probably be the seventh day. He might not take action, because he didn't have enough time to gather information.
         However, they could also go and take a look ... Because no one would have thought that Li Hao would dare to have ideas about the wind-chasing boots at this time.
         How bold was he to dare to do such a thing?
         They didn't even dare to take Li Hao's previous suggestion to deal with the two powerful existences, the Earthcover sword and the radiant sword, let alone Li Hao. Moreover, in everyone's eyes, Li Hao should have retreated to Whitemoon city as soon as he received the news!
         How could he leave so easily?
         However, the long journey was indeed very tiring.
         Li Hao glanced at the Black Panther swaying beside him ... The Black Panther was much bigger and fatter than before. Li Hao's eyes flickered. The Black Panther should be very fast and had good stamina. The physical strength of a demon was stronger than that of a human.
          If he rode a dog ... He might be faster.  The Black Panther seemed to have sensed something. With its keen senses as a demon, it raised its head and glanced at Li Hao in confusion.
         Li Hao patted the dog's head and chuckled.
         Soon, everyone entered the base's Hall. Li Hao glanced at them and said,""Everyone, cultivate here for a few days and comprehend for a few days. We'll leave after a few days ... There's no rush!"
         "Yes!" Liu Long nodded and said in a deep voice,"we won't go out these few days, and we won't let anyone in either!"
         Clearly, Li Hao had some ideas.
         He didn't ask. Knowing more might not be a good thing.
         "That's good!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything more. He just waited in silence.
         When the sky was completely dark.
         He waited for the people outside to leave.
         If he returned to the base, would Huang Yu and director Zhao continue to keep an eye on him?
         ? It wouldn 't.
         The city was still very safe.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com ……
         Just as Li Hao had expected, when he returned with his people, the divine boat was already parked in the square. Huang Yu waited for a while, but he still chose to leave.
         However, he also had some people keep a close eye on this place. It wasn't surveillance, but rather, he didn't want Li Hao to lead the demon hunt squad out of the place, as it was extremely dangerous outside!
         On the other hand, at the administration Bureau.
         For the first time, the light sword walked into the administrative Bureau in broad daylight.
         She was a little curious. This was the first time she had stepped into this place in her life.
         Even though she was a Silver Moon Martial Master, the government of the pugilistic world had always been on opposing sides. But now, she had walked in in a grand manner.
          At the door, Deputy Director Zhou led the way and said,""Miss Hu, this way ..."
         The radiant sword looked at him with an awkward expression.
         Deputy Director Zhou knew what she was thinking and felt a little awkward, "It's not a good way to address me, so I have to do it this way. Grandmaster Hu ... If you don't like it, then I ... Can I change my way of addressing you?"
         Usually, he would call her the light sword, but he couldn't do the same here.
         "Just call me swordsman Hu!"
         The light sword didn't say anything else. Grandmaster ... According to their previous titles, there was no problem in calling her a demigod. However, Grandmaster, in the ancient civilization, was a martial artist who was willing to sacrifice his life for justice, for the people, for the country, and for the race. She wasn 't.
         Therefore, she didn't ask him to address her that way.
         Deputy Director Zhou didn't say anything more. He led her up to the second floor and the door to the hall opened.
         At this moment, Kong Jie and director Zhao were both there. Just as they entered, Huang Yu walked in as well. Director Zhao looked at him and he said,""He's back. He's waiting at the base. He just came back and probably won't be going out for a while, so I came over to take a look. Since the light sword is here, let me know."
         Director Zhao nodded his head and stood up. He looked at the light sword and smiled, "I've seen the light sword, the Seven Swords of the Silver Moon. I've never seen the light swordsman before. It's time to see him in person!"
        
         The light sword cursed in her heart. If it wasn't for the fact that she had recovered some of her looks, and although she wasn't too pretty, she could still look good, she wouldn't have shown her true face to others.
         At this thought, he recalled Li Hao's words. Silver Moon had paid him to save the people.
         The radiant sword didn't beat around the bush and directly said,"This time, I'll have to trouble you to help me! This Hu is eternally grateful, but since we walk different paths, if the Silver Moon officials need anything in the future, this Hu will definitely be at their service ... As for anything else, I won't talk about it!"
         Kong Jie laughed."The light sword. How is that different?"
         "Kong Jie, when you were inspecting Silver Moon, you had the blood of many martial masters under you. Naturally, you have a different path!" The Sword of Light looked at him and said indifferently.
         Kong Jie frowned,"what? I, Kong Jie, am wrong in maintaining order in Silver Moon?" "I asked myself honestly, none of the martial masters I've killed were good. If you say that the others aren't good, I'll support you a little, but if you say that I'm ... Then that means that your light sword is nothing but a Martial Master. You don't have any ability to distinguish right from wrong."
         The light sword did not argue.
         Kong Jie was also bored and no longer spoke.
         Director Zhao laughed."We're all Silver Moon citizens. Silver Moon citizens have always been hot-blooded since ancient times. It's fine to make a fuss behind closed doors ... However, since master Hu is direct, let's not beat around the bush. Master Hu's words are enough! If there are any changes to Silvermoon, I hope that we can help each other and watch out for each other!"
         "I'll definitely do my best!"
          The radiant sword replied. That was all.
         He didn't have the enthusiasm he had imagined, nor did he shed tears of gratitude. He didn't even have the teary scene of meeting fellow townsmen, much less reminiscing about the past.
         If he met Yuan Shuo and the others, he would be able to chat with them.
         Forget about these few.
         One was an official, and the other, strictly speaking, was a Bandit.
         The martial masters of the past were all bandits.
         After chatting for a while, Huang Yu asked directly,""How is the strength of Duke dingguo?"
         "He's stronger than me!"
         The light sword pondered for a moment and guessed,""The four limbs 'superpower locks are definitely full. As for the five organs' superpower locks, at least three of them are full."
         As soon as he said this, the few of them frowned.
         So strong?
         Kong Jie also touched her chin and looked at her.""How about you?"
         "Two strands are saturated."
         Kong Jie laughed,"not bad!" I thought that you guys didn't make much progress over the years. The southern Fist sect has probably only reached saturation in one of its five viscera, and can barely break the five viscera lock. This guy is even more arrogant than you. "
         The light sword did not hold back and asked,""Then how about you?"
         "Me?"
         Kong Jie laughed."Only two. The third one is a bit lacking."
         After saying that, he hesitated, but still asked,""Did you find any superpower lock in the head, body, or bones? There are only nine limbs and five internal organs, but it should be more than that ..."  The human body should be completely sealed off.
         At present, there was one in the head that everyone acknowledged. Even though they couldn't find it, whether it existed in the body and bone armor was a mystery.
         "I don't know. I didn't sense it."
         Kong Jie nodded slightly and asked,"which aspect are you focusing on?"
         "Force!"
         Kong Jie nodded again."It's just these few aspects. Momentum, physical body, vitality, they're more or less the same. As for the five internal organs, Yuan Shuo is currently working on it. However, the five internal organs are also the most difficult ... I wonder if that guy has any results."
         He sighed and wanted to say something more, but Huang Yu suddenly said,""How many do you think the earth overturning sword has been filled with?"
         "I don't know." The light sword shook its head.
         The few of them frowned slightly. How could they not know?
         However, he roughly knew what she meant. It wasn't that he didn't know, it wasn't that he didn't guess, he just didn't want to say it.
         She was definitely stronger than her.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If it wasn't three, it would be four.
         "If all five organs are filled to the maximum, can I break through to the next level?" the radiant sword asked.
         "I don't know. I've never tried it."
         Kong Jie shook her head,"at this stage, there might not be anyone who can fill up nine." The few of us actually have some advantages in becoming supers. We'll become supers first, break through the barrier, and then become martial masters ..."
         The light sword's eyes flickered."Can it really return?"
         "Of course!"
          Kong Jie nodded and said,"yes!" Your light power is too strong, so you can overcome many difficulties. At that time, we were short of energy, so we all chose to take the side path ... However, there are some disadvantages. Of course, there are advantages and disadvantages. "
         "Now that I've become a superpower, can I become a Martial Master again?"
         "There's hope ... But it's too dangerous and too difficult!"He said.
         Kong Jie shook her head."It's best not to try. Actually, at this stage, trying is a very dangerous thing. Sky sword is still a superpower ... I don't know what he's thinking. If he doesn't switch back and step into the sunrise realm ... He'll break two of his superpower locks and it'll be difficult to recover ... There's still a way to recover one."
         "Maybe he's trying to find a better way out," Huang Yu said calmly."He has his own plans, but he won't be content with being a super forever."
         The light sword only listened quietly and did not speak again.
         After a long time, director Zhao asked,"Can Li Hao's sword really suppress the five internal organs rebellion?"
         "I don't know." The light sword shook its head.
         The few of them were speechless!
         Everyone knows this. For someone who has experienced it personally to say such words ... It's really heartbreaking. You've spent money in vain.
        
         Three origin God weapons and 30000 divine power stones.
         "What are your plans after this?"
         "I'll stay with Li Hao for a few days ... If I have time, I'll go to swords gate."
         Alright!
         The few of them were helpless. It seemed like the light sword was not willing to have too much contact with them. Director Zhao thought about it and said, "That's fine. We'll find you on the communication Jade. If you don't need us, you can do whatever you want!"
         The Sword of Light took the jade pendant and kept it in his storage ring without saying anything. He stood up and said,"I'll take my leave then!"
         With that, he turned around and left.
         After she left, Kong Jie smiled bitterly and said,"these guys are still the same!" "She's uncomfortable with coming into contact with us and can't wait to get as far away from us as possible. Initially, I thought that even after spending so much money and having left Silver Moon for 20 years, the result would still be the same ..."
         "You'll be fine once you get used to it!"
         Director Zhao didn't find it strange and asked,""Did you give the communication Jade to Li Hao?"
          "I've given it to him,"
         "That's good. Tell him to go out less in the next few days. It's not peaceful outside. Those guys are still wary of us for the time being ... But if Li Hao appears again, it will arouse their greed ... Sigh!"
         He sighed. This was a little troublesome.
         As such, Silver Moon would be closely watched.
         As for Li Hao, he probably wouldn't be able to go out and train anymore. However, Li Hao's strength increased quickly, so he could train for a while. Director Zhao and the others had simple thoughts.
         Now that Li Hao had reached this level, it would not be a problem for him to settle down for a few months or even a year or two.
         Therefore, he wasn't in a hurry.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao had already walked out of the Wei Wu army base.
         With this pair of eyes, he avoided all the superpowers and surveillance. Not long after, he entered the sea in his silver armor.
         Black Panther followed.
         This guy's nose was very sensitive, and nothing could be hidden from it. With it around, some of Li Hao's shortcomings were made up for.
         Everyone thought he wouldn't leave, but he chose to leave at this moment.
         He wanted to catch everyone off guard!
         He had left the communication Jade that Kong Jie had given him in the Wei Wu army base. It didn't matter if he didn't have any information, he could just snatch it.
         "As for the White shark Pirates ... If we can kill them, then kill them. If we can 't, then just ignore them. We'll talk about it after I get my wind chasing boots ..."
         Li Hao weighed the situation in his mind. At this moment, he had to speed up and quickly reach the province where the Duke dingguo's mansion was located.
         It was only three and a half days until the seventh day of Xu Zhen's birthday.
         Li Hao still wanted to burn incense for them!
          The Duke of dingguo was extremely powerful.  However, Li Hao wasn't trying to assassinate him. All he had to do was take the treasure. Even if he succeeded, it would be troublesome to escape the siege of Duke dingguo's mansion. It was said that the remaining three generals were probably at the transformation stage.
         Li Hao touched the dog's head and dived into the sea. He quickly moved forward and said to the Black Panther,""Work well with me later. If we succeed, I still have a lot of divine power stones on hand. I'll give you enough to eat!"
         "Ah PU ah PU!"
         The Black Panther cried out twice. The seawater that entered his mouth was spat out again. The Black Panther that had dived to the bottom of the sea was slightly uncomfortable. Swimming was fine, but diving was really uncomfortable.
         "Don't shout. After leaving the Silver Moon, we'll travel on land and take a look at this land ... I haven't been to any other place other than the Silver Moon. Even the North Sea was just a look at the sea ..."
         If they didn't go on land, without the divine boat, the speed would be much slower. On land, riding the Black Panther might be much faster.
         As for the Black Panther, it was still unaware of Li Hao's thoughts. It happily wagged its tail.
         ……
         At the same time.
         In the Great Eastern land.
         Dingbian province.
         This was the province where the high Duke's public house was located. The name of the province had been given by the imperial family back then. The high Duke dingguo was in charge of this place and set the eastern border for the dynasty.
         In the Grand public house.
         These few days, the atmosphere was gloomy.
         Five generals had died, the eldest son of the first wife had died, the eldest grandson of the first wife had died, a guest official at the peak of the rising light realm had died, and a consecrator at the late stage of the rising light realm had died.
         This year was clearly an unlucky year for the Duke dingguo's mansion.
         A total of 9 Sunglow powerhouses had died!
         With such strength, they could even suppress one or two provinces.
          But now, they had died one after another, and even lost a wind-chasing shoe.
         At this moment, Duke dingguo's face was calm and not too sad, but in the depths of his eyes, there was an overflowing killing intent.
         However, on the surface, he was still extremely calm. He looked at the experts below and said calmly,""Xing 'er will be in charge of the high Duke's public house's grand ceremony three days later! I'm their father, their grandfather ... There's no rule to send them off ..."
         Below, his second son was also in pain. He stood up and said,""Don't worry father, I'll make arrangements for big brother and Xiao Feng's funeral. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Xu Qing looked at his son and didn't say anything.
         Perhaps, this son of his would be very happy in his heart.
         With Xu Zhen dead, the next Duke would be him.
         Xu Qing did have other children, but they were all sons of concubines and had no right to assume the position of Duke. However, to Xu Qing, was a Duke ... Really enough?
         "According to the rules of our ancestors, the Xu family's sacred object must be offered for three days during the ceremony to comfort our ancestors!" But now, I've lost one of my Windchaser's boots ... Sigh!"
         He let out a long sigh and said,"even so, we can't break the rules of our ancestors. However, the wind-chasing boots are extremely important. Now that one is lost, the remaining one is even more important. On the day of the ceremony, you must guard it carefully ..."
        
         "Father, if that's the case, why don't we use a substitute ..." Xu Xing said hurriedly.
         "Are you trying to deceive your ancestors?"
         Xu Qing looked at his second son and said indifferently,""If the Xu family doesn't even dare to take out the ancestral sacred object and is worried that it will be taken away in the ancestral hall, then is there still a need for the Duke dingguo's mansion to exist?"
         Xu Xing cursed in his heart. You said to be careful, and I was just going along with your words. Now you're saying this again. You're really ... Unreasonable!
         Xu Qing ignored him and looked down at the crowd.""Everyone is the main pillar of my residence, so I'll have to trouble you for this great ritual! When the ceremony is over, I will go to the Army to worship the five generals and enter the ding country Army's Hall of Heroes! The two foreign officials and their descendants will be taken care of until the day the high Duke's public house no longer exists ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He then consoled these people. The people below were also grateful, but it was hard to tell whether it was true or not.
         Soon, a middle-aged man said in a muffled voice,""High Duke, how should we deal with the light sword and Li Hao?"
         If this revenge was not taken, how could the Duke dingguo's mansion still have the face to stand in the eastern land?
         The uncrowned King of the East had suffered a great loss at the hands of these barbarians. It was hard to accept.
          "They're all in Silver Moon ..."
         Xu Qing spoke halfway and after a moment, he said coldly,""However, the Silver Moon is not a forbidden land! Lock down the Silver Moon first. If they don't come out ... Then we'll wait for a while, and the dingguo Army will definitely break the Silver Moon!"
         When these words came out, everyone became a lot more excited.
         "When we catch the light sword and Li Hao, we'll definitely tear them into pieces!" Someone said through gritted teeth.
         "The Duke should have gathered all the powerhouses in the East to seek justice at Silver Moon, but the imperial family and the nine divisions did not care ... Did they not react at all when the Duke was killed? The Duke of dingguo defended the eastern land of the dynasty, but he ended up like this. It can be seen that the dynasty is corrupt and incompetent!"
         The group of people were filled with righteous indignation and began to attack the nine divisions and the imperial family.
         Some people's expressions changed slightly. They were a little terrified, but they didn't dare to say anything.
         He glanced at Xu Qing above ... It was obvious that someone had already guessed something.
         The imperial family and the Jiusi did not stand up for him, and instead watched as the Duke's son was killed. If word got out, it would only further prove the incapability of the imperial family and the Jiusi.
         It was to destroy the confidence of some people in the dynasty.
         Obviously, the Duke dingguo already had his own ideas.
         Soon, everyone left.  Only the Duke of dingguo and his second son, Xu Xing, were left.
         Duke dingguo watched everyone leave, and then looked at his nervous second son. After a moment of silence, he said,"Your big brother is gone. No matter how fierce the fights are, we can't let any scandals happen during his first seven ceremonies! He's gone, so you're the next Duke. A Duke should have The Heart of a Duke ... Manage it well. If you want to become the next Duke ... At the very least, you should avenge your brother and nephew!"
         "Don't worry, father. Xing 'er knows what to do!"
         Xu Xing hurriedly bowed and promised. Xu Qing, on the other hand, was a little tired. Without saying anything more, he threw out a ring."These are wind-chasing boots. On the day of the great ceremony, offer them to the ancestral shrine. You can't slack off!"
         "I understand!"
         Xu Xing was overjoyed. In the past, he wasn't even qualified to be in charge of a sacred object. However, his big brother had been in charge of it for a period of time.
         Now that his big brother had left, his father had no other choice, which was not bad.
         He walked quite well!
         Xu Qing waved his hand and drove him away. Out of sight, out of mind.
         He only sighed after his son had left.
          There were not many outstanding people in the Xu family's generation. The two direct descendants had average martial arts talent. The eldest had become a superpower, while the second had managed to cross the threshold of force with the help of countless resources and the Enlightenment ancient weapon. Now, he had three four-limbed superpower locks.
         When the Super Lock in the last four limbs was full, he would be able to enter a special realm. This was also the path that most of the top martial masters were taking.
         He looked to the North, and a cold light flickered in his eyes.
         His son had been killed, so it was inevitable that he would seek revenge.
         However, the light sword was too bold, and it really took away the Windchaser's boots ... It was determined to fight to the death.
         "Silver Moon ..."
         Xu Qing snorted coldly. 'Let's see how long you can be arrogant!'
         That Li Hao was probably trembling in fear right now. For a while, he probably wouldn't dare to take a single step out of the Silver Moon even if he died. Although Ying Hongyue's move was good, the news had spread far and wide, giving them time to prepare to retreat.
         As a result, it was even more difficult to recover the wind chasing boots in a short time.
        
         (I have to go out tomorrow, so I can only come back at night. I don't rest on Saturday and weekend, so I'll only be back at night. I don't think it's considered a leave of absence ... I've been on leave for two days, and my monthly tickets have dropped so badly that I don't dare to say I'm on leave.)
         On land.
         Li Hao was currently riding on the Black Panther.
         The Black Panther twisted its body, wagged its tail, and then shook its head. It then turned around and licked Li Hao ...
         Li Hao slapped him,"what?" If you're not happy, just say it. If you're not happy, then you're happy. Why are you licking me?"
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         "Speak human language! If you don't speak, it means you agree. You're fast, so hurry up and don't go the wrong way. We're in a hurry!"
         "Woof!"
         Heibao's eyes were filled with tears.
         But I don't want to be ridden either, it's uncomfortable.
          Li Hao straightened its head."Let's go. Hurry up. If we get there quickly, we won't have to be ridden." The longer you drag it out, the longer I'll ride it. Think about it, isn't this the logic?"
         "I don't want to ride a dog either, I think it's embarrassing. "But you've been eating so much, you should lose some weight. Otherwise, the next time we fight, you'll be too fat to run. I'm doing this for your own good. You're too fat. If I take you to heaven battling city next time and the expert who stimulated your bloodline sees you, he might torture you again, right?"
         That made sense!
         Black Panther thought to himself.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But ...
         Forget it!
         The Black Panther helplessly drooped its tail. Li Hao pointed in a direction, and the Black Panther quickly ran. It had to be said that even if it was a dog, it was still a demonic dog and was really fast.
         Like a gust of wind, he instantly crossed the beach.
         Li Hao smiled. The wind whistled past his ears. Li Hao wanted to lean on it, but found that there was nothing he could lean on. He could only say,""Raise your tail and let me lean on it. It's not comfortable."
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         The Black Panther roared!
         "I'm cultivating. If I cultivate, the sword energy will overflow. Otherwise, I won't cultivate if my posture is uncomfortable."
         Pata!
         Its tail stood straight.
         Li Hao's mouth twitched. I knew you couldn't change your gluttonous habit.
         At this moment, they were at the edge of the North Sea.
         If one were to walk along the North Sea and head east, they would be able to cross the northern continent in less than ten thousand miles.
         The northern continent and the eastern continent were separated by the sea and a mountain range. The four continents were almost the same, and the central continent was in the middle.
         If one were to look down, the square continent and the central continent looked like a huge basin. It was surrounded by hills and mountains. The square continent was separated by Four Seas, and in the middle was the largest central continent.
         Out of the four provinces, there were 19 in the North, 22 in the center, and 21 in the East.  The eastern continent was a vast land with abundant resources, and it was not as poor as the Silver Moon continent.
         It was said that the East was rich. The place where the sunrise even built a shocking Eastern Sea bridge over the East Sea that connected the East Sea and the central region. It was simply incredible.
         Of course, in this era, if a super wanted to, they could do it.
         If the powerhouses of earth element, metal element, and water element worked together, they could build a bridge across the sea. Even so, only the eastern continent could build such a bridge.
         From this, one could see how wealthy the East was, how many experts there were, and how many superpowers there were.
         In the 21 provinces of the East, the Xu family was not the only Overlord, but they were also the nominal ruler of the East. In addition to the title of Duke, the Duke of dingguo also had another position, the general of Donghai.
         He was in charge of the East Sea Navy!
         Of course, the sea area was now dominated by Pirates, and the so-called Navy only existed in name. However, with this name, as long as the other party was strong enough, he could build a huge Navy and unify the East Sea. Even the nine divisions were not qualified to stop him.
         ……
         Li Hao recalled the information in his mind as he looked at the scenery on both sides.
         The Silver Moon was too close to the North. In October, it even began to freeze, and the cold wind whistled.
         After the Silver Moon, the North Sea was also very cold, but it was slightly better than the Silver Moon. The cold was very obvious. Further east, although it was also near the sea, it was not cold anymore.
         The blade-like cold wind also turned into a warm breeze.
         Not only that, Li Hao also discovered a strange phenomenon.
         Even the time difference was a little different. It was daytime before, but after running for a long time ... It was still daytime!
         The world was so big that there were all kinds of strange things!
         It had been raining heavily just now, but in the blink of an eye, the sun was hanging high in the sky.
         On one side, it was raining, and on the other, it was the sun.
         Li Hao stopped at the dividing line for a moment, his eyes full of amazement!
          If he did not leave the Silver Moon, he might not be able to see such a magnificent view in his entire life.
         The sky was a little dark under the silver moon.
         However, the sky here was extremely bright.
         Silvermoon's path was full of potholes, but the path here was straight and wide ...
         Of course, not all of them were good!
         On the way, Li Hao saw broken walls!
         A village near the sea had been burned down by fire. He heard sobbing. Li Hao rode the Black Panther closer and listened. The language was the same, but the accent was slightly different.
         "Damn those Montenegro bandits ... They robbed us of all our food at this time of the year. Aren't they forcing us to our deaths?"
         "Father, let's join the White sage Army!"
         "Bullsh * t! What holy white Army? they're just bandits who want to rebel ..."
