        ays, he had been killing everywhere.
         Didn't li Hao know that the three great organizations would eventually think of him?
         Naturally, he knew.
         However, with so many martial masters on the move, there was not much hope of hiding it forever. A few days would be enough.
         He had also expected that these people would not send a large number of experts to deal with him at the beginning. However, it seemed that it was still alright. The three major organizations had sent six Triple Sun realm experts. It was enough!
         With such strength, he could even deal with sunguang.
         The other party attached great importance to it.
         However, Li Hao still felt that ... These guys looked down on him. To deal with his teacher, Crimson Moon alone had sent out several sunguangs, and they might even be at the peak of the sunguangs.
         Orange moon and yellow moon were likely to be at the peak of the rising light realm.
         But against him, not even a single sunguang had come?
          Was he much worse than his teacher?
         At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat angry.
         Who are you looking down on?
         ……
         At the same time.
         In the South.
         The three three three yang realm Masters flew across the sky. Suddenly, Zheng ping, who was at the late stage of the three yang realm, frowned slightly and looked to the West. He snorted and said in a low voice,""The person from the flying heavens seems to be Banshan's disciple. He's so sneaky. He's at the peak of the three suns realm and he's so ghostly!"
         Peak of the three suns!
         There was only one Fei Tian, but this person was not simple. He was extremely strong, at the peak of the three suns, and was also a dark-type expert. He was good at hiding his tracks.
         However, at this moment, he revealed some aura.
         Because he had also discovered the other three suns.
         If they didn't show up at this time, it would be easy to cause misunderstandings. They were all here to deal with Li Hao, so they didn't want to end up fighting.
         On the other side, Zheng ping had already sensed the two powerhouses from the Yama. One of them was at the mid-stage of three yang while the other was at the late-stage of three yang.
         It could be said that the three families actually attached great importance to this.
         The red moon sent three three suns, and the other two families also sent three.
         Zheng ping sent a voice transmission."Be careful of their goal. They might not be here to deal with Li Hao. They might be here to take Li Hao from us or kill him."
         Otherwise, they would only be dealing with a group of martial masters. The strongest among them were Liu Long and Li Hao, who had just entered the Qian Jin realm not long ago. Why would they need so many experts?
         Jinjiu and Duan Chao both nodded.
         He was a little solemn.
         They weren't afraid of Li Hao. Who would be afraid of a Martial Master who hadn't even reached the level of a Qian warrior a month ago?
         Then they would be pawned.  Yuan Shuo was a special case. He had settled down for many years and was not a newcomer like Li Hao. Even so, when Yuan Shuo entered the Qian dynasty, he did not attract much attention. It was only when he reached the spiritual accumulation stage that he was targeted.
         They were more worried that Li Hao would be captured, or even killed, by these two parties.
         If that happened, Red moon's mission would be a complete failure.
         Capturing Li Hao was their top priority.
         If they couldn't capture him, they would consider killing him. Even if they killed him, they had to take his body. This was red moon's bottom line.
         Zheng ping had an ordinary appearance, and he was also expressionless at this moment. He glanced around from the corner of his eyes and sent a voice transmission,"According to our leads, Li Hao and his team should be hiding nearby! If you encounter them later, your first task is to keep an eye on Yama and Fei Tian's men, while I'll deal with Li Hao and the others ... After capturing Li Hao, quickly retreat!"
         "Yes!"
         The two of them hurriedly sent voice transmissions. They were very nervous.
         Sometimes, Red Moon had to protect Li Hao.
         At the same time, the three red Shadows silently rushed forward. Zheng ping and the others wanted to use the Red Shadows to find Li Hao first and then control him. If they could quietly get rid of Li Hao and bring him back, that would naturally be the best choice.
         ……
         In the West.
         A black figure wearing a cloak was walking on the ground. Under the cloak, the corners of his mouth were slightly raised.
         Zheng ping?
         Although the red moon had sent three three suns, the strongest one was Zheng ping ... If they captured Li Hao later and he killed Li Hao ... Would he dare to fall out with him?
         Under the cloak, a smile appeared on his young face.
         A moment later, the black shadow completely disappeared. Not a single bit of its aura leaked out. They had already greeted each other. Now that it had disappeared, don't tell anyone that they had come here secretly.
         Perhaps, he could capture Li Hao first and take him away.
         The eight great families "descendants ... How interesting.
         ……
          In the East.
         There were also two three-sun strong men. One of them was covered in patterns, and his upper body was bare. He was extremely majestic.
         The other person was a female, and she looked extremely enchanting.
         The woman also looked at the other two for a while and smiled charmingly. "It's actually Yue Ying from Fei Tian's side. This guy's concealment ability is first-class. I heard that he previously assassinated a powerhouse at the peak of the three suns. I don't know if it's true or not."
         Beside him, the brawny man said coldly,"assassin?" Assassination? That's because he hasn't met me yet. He can try to assassinate me and see if he can break my defense!"
         He was an earth element expert, a late-stage three yang expert. Moreover, he specialized in the earth element, which was extremely good at defense.
         Before he became a superpower, he was also a Martial Master, but he was not very strong. He became a superpower after killing ten peak states.
         As a Martial Master, he was very proud.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Under normal circumstances, a Martial master's superpower would be stronger than a normal superpower. Although the other party was at the peak of three suns, he was not afraid. A peak three suns who could only move in the dark could break his defense.
         The woman was at the middle stage of the three yang realm. When she heard this, she smiled and said,""Of course, who doesn't know that the iron wall of the Yama is invincible in defense. In the 19 provinces in the North, I'm afraid that there aren't many who have a stronger defense than you. "
        
         Only a few people?
         Iron wall secretly sneered. Other than those sunguang and three yang realm experts, who else could have a stronger defense than him?
         He knew a few peak three suns experts and there were also some earth-type experts. He had also compared them and no one was stronger than him.
         Therefore, deep down, he felt that he was the number one person in the defense of the three suns in the North.
         Of course, if he said this, it might cause some trouble. In order to avoid trouble, he didn't say it, but he always thought so in his heart.
         "Let's go and take a look at that kid. He's really bold. Does he really think he's yuan Shuo?"
         Iron wall called out coldly.
         Li Hao ... This unknown little guy, if it weren't for Yuan Shuo and the eight great families "reputation, he wouldn't even be bothered to look at such a character. But now, he was so bold that he actually destroyed a branch of the Yama.
         If Red Moon wanted to take her away ... Forget it.
         Tie bi didn't put Hong Yue and the other two in his eyes at all, but he paid some attention to the flying Yue tan. Although he wasn't afraid of the other party's assassination, she was still a powerhouse at the peak of the three yang realm.
          ……
         Three sides surrounded him.
         They all had clues that Li Hao was most likely hiding in the small mountain in front of them.
         Xiao Shan was the best.
         They couldn't even escape, so they were suitable to be the grave of the Wei Wu Army.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao watched silently.
         He watched as the three sides rushed towards him, and three huge Red Shadows quickly flew towards him.
         He thought of himself as meat, as if he was blind.
         There were three of them. Did they think I couldn't see them?
         However, six three suns ... The pressure was huge.
         The starry sky sword appeared in his hand.
         Li Hao broke eight divine power stones, which were quickly absorbed by the small sword. Part of the divine power flowed into his body.
         He turned around and looked at the black-armored martial masters with a smile.""After a few days of killing, everyone has improved a lot. However ... Trouble has come. Now, six three suns from the three major organizations are coming from all directions ..."
         The crowd was a little restless.
         Three suns!
         There were still six of them!
         "These few days, I did not take much action, but I have obtained quite a lot of benefits. Although I am your group leader, I can not eat for free."
         Li Hao laughed."Everyone says that my master, Yuan Shuo, is the number one Martial Master ... But my master said that the student has surpassed the master, and that's the result he wants. My master became famous in one battle by killing the eyebrow-raising staff ... I wonder if I, Li Hao, can become famous tonight!"
         "Vice-commander Liu!"
         Li Hao shouted. At this moment, Liu Long, who was also wearing black armor, quickly said in a deep voice,"Here!"
         "Your mission is very simple ... Watch the show and defend!"
         Li Hao said calmly,"we'll watch from here. These three suns came first, but that doesn't mean that they didn't follow. They might be behind ..."
         Liu Long hurriedly said,"let's join forces and use the formation. We might not be able to kill the three suns, but we can definitely stop one of them ... Brothers, don't be afraid. These few days, we ..."
         "No need!"
         Li Hao raised his hand and interrupted him. He smiled and said,""Trust me! If I can't kill these guys ... There's not much point in you stopping one of them. "  Could they be stopped?
         It was still possible for the 50 of them to gather their strength in Liu Long.
         But ... Was it necessary?
         Stop who?
         If it was alone, it would be at the peak of three suns. Even if it could stop them for a while, many of these people would die.
         Hei Teng's defense wasn't truly invincible.
         It could only block the attack of sunlight.
         "It's good that you have such thoughts. At least everyone is not afraid of the three suns now!"
         "If the sun glory is coming, then kill them!"
         Li Hao took a deep breath and looked into the distance. Who should he deal with first?
         Was he from the Crimson Moon?
         No, keep the Crimson Moon.
         Hong Yue's people would not kill him rashly, as they would be restrained. However, the other two sides would only kill him directly.
         The one at the peak of the three suns?
         Li Hao thought for a while and laughed. That's right. He should kill the strongest first.
         However, he couldn't scare the others away, or he might not be able to catch up.
         Just a little closer!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Thinking of this, he leaped and directly jumped to the peak of the mountain. With a few leaps, as if he was flying in the air, he quickly rushed over.
         Liu Long and the others were especially heavy-hearted.
         Six three suns!
         Li Hao was really too crazy.
         At this moment, Liu Long finally understood why Li Hao hadn't been too focused on cleaning up the battlefield in the past few days. He didn't even try to cover his tracks. Sometimes, someone suggested to get rid of those tracks, but Li Hao refused.
         He said there was no need.
         Yes, there was no need.
         Because he had long been prepared to do a big business.
          ……
         At this moment, among Li Hao's five internal organs, the earth sword force and the fire Tiger Force were ready to move, but the origin of the metal element was motionless.
         The third force was still not successfully fused.
         In his hand, the starry sky sword seemed to be longer than before. In the past, it was only as long as a chopstick. Although it was called a sword, it was actually more like a dagger. Now, it was as long as a small arm and could be considered a real sword, although it was still not as long as an ordinary long sword.
         "The fusion of the two forces can only barely match the peak of the three yang realm. It can't kill ..."
         Li Hao thought to himself.
         When he was dealing with Huang Jie before, he did not manage to kill him. He only managed to kill Huang Jie after using the art of the bloody blade and Hao lianchuan to restrain his opponent.
         Therefore, the fusion of the two forces only had the strength of the late stage of three yang.
         If he wanted to kill a peak three yang, he had to either combine the three forces or use the blood Blade technique.
         Of course, Li Hao was stronger than before. His body, Qi, and blood were stronger, and his divine will was more powerful. If he used the bloody blade art now, even if he couldn't kill the peak three-Sun Warrior easily, he would be able to fight him and not be at a disadvantage.
        
         "If I want to win ... I have to fuse the three forces!"
         Li Hao's eyes flickered as he continued forward.
         This time, the third stance he wanted to fuse wasn't the metal origin. The metal origin was too sharp, so what Li Hao wanted to fuse was actually the water stance after the ninth refinement!
         However, he had yet to reach the ninth fold.
         The eighth stack had just been completed.
         But ... What was there to be afraid of?
         If it really didn't work, he would just forcefully merge the third force.
         ……
         Li Hao moved very quickly.
         There was very little movement.
          He went straight for the largest ball of light. When he was less than a kilometer away from it, Li Hao stopped.
         At this moment, the orbs of light from the other two directions were not too far away from him.
         He stopped at a central point.
         Li Hao stopped in his tracks.
         He waited silently.
         The fierce tiger in his heart was restless, dragging the chain as if he was looking forward to going out and see a better scenery.
         Nine hundred meters ... Eight hundred meters ...
         The largest ball of light was not slow.
         However, there were some ghosts running here and there, as if they were playing hide-and-seek.
         Dark element!
         Li Hao didn't move at all, like a stone statue.
         ……
         In the distance.
         The flying Yue Ying seemed to have seen a figure. In the darkness, he was like a shadow, and others couldn't even see him.
         At this moment, Yue Ying was a little surprised.
         There was someone ... In front?
         Who would come to the wilderness in the middle of the night?
         It was not a superpower. He did not feel any superpower fluctuations.
         A Martial Master?
         Li Hao and his group?
         His heart skipped a beat. Was it Li Hao and his gang?
         Fishing again?
         He laughed. Under the cloak, his smile was brilliant. Were these guys addicted to fishing?
         In the past few days, this group of people had been doing this kind of thing. Now, the three major organizations had learned that these people had such a habit. They used the same routine and repeated it. Did they really think everyone was an idiot?
         He quickly approached, and the closer he got, the more confused he became.
         That person was not wearing black armor.
         It was normal to fish.
         However, in the dark, his vision was good, and he felt that this person was vaguely familiar ...
         Upon closer inspection, wasn't this Li Hao?
         The three great organizations still had Li Hao's appearance.
         Li Hao?
         Yue PU's heart moved. Li Hao ... Is here?  He's here alone?
         It was very strange!
         Did this guy not know that the three major organizations were going to make a move on him, or did he think that it would be difficult for them to find him, so he was cultivating here?
         ……
         After Yue Ying discovered Li Hao, Hong Yue's people were the second to discover him.
         The three red Shadows also discovered Li Hao at this moment.
         In the distance, Zheng Ping's expression changed slightly, and he quickly transmitted a message.""Quick, Yue Ying is nearby!"
         The three of them quickly accelerated!
         Li Hao was actually standing in the wilderness by himself, while Yue PU was only a few hundred meters away from him. Their expressions changed, and Zheng ping quickly sent a voice transmission."Use the shadow God to block yueshu. Jinjiu, your shadow God will go and capture Li Hao!"
         Two of the three red Shadows quickly flew toward Yue Ying, stopping her from attacking Li Hao.
         The other red shadow flew toward Li Hao.
         The commotion caused by the three of them immediately attracted the attention of Yama's two companions. They had not seen Li Hao yet, but seeing the red moon's people so excited, they clearly knew that they had discovered Li Hao's presence.
         The two of them didn't stay idle. They quickly followed them and flew toward Li Hao.
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao raised his head and saw a red shadow flying toward him.
         He also saw the other two red figures flying rapidly towards Yue Ying.
         At this moment, Yue Ying originally wanted to observe for a while more, but she suddenly felt the existence of the red shadow. That feeling made her know that this was Hong Yue's Blood God.
         "Hmph!"
         The moon Bodhi snorted."I wanted to see how you're so anxious and take the initiative to attack. Don't blame me for striking first!"
         With a flash, he quickly charged at Li Hao.
         In the distance, Zheng Ping's expression changed. The moon Gu was extremely fast, and it was hard for him to catch it when it was hidden.
         At this moment, he had no choice but to shout,""Li Hao, let's go. The flying killer is near you! Give up resisting and let the shadow God take you away ..."
         Was it funny?
         At this moment, it was red moon's men who warned Li Hao.
         But Li Hao was not surprised at all.
         Red Moon was probably the last enemy who wanted him to die.
         He didn't move.
         As for Yue Ying, her figure also appeared. What was there to hide in front of Li Hao?
         He was at the peak of the three suns realm, so why would he be afraid of Li Hao discovering his whereabouts?
         Like an arrow, Yue PU crossed a few hundred meters in an instant. He even had the mood to help Li Hao repel the red shadow. A dark-type superpower exploded above Li Hao's head. With a boom, he vaguely repelled a shadow.
         The red shadow could not be dealt with by ordinary means.
          However, at Yue Ying's level, she was at the peak of the three yang realm and could vaguely sense her opponent's presence. It was not as if the Yama and Fei Tian did not have any tricks up their sleeves to deal with the red shadow. This thing involved the spiritual level. As long as they mixed some spiritual power into their superpowers, they would naturally be able to handle it.
         With a loud boom, Li Hao's head exploded.
         "If Hongyue wants to catch you, she'll skin you alive and pull out your bones. Come with me ..." Yue Tan's voice was faint.
         Fei Tian might not necessarily kill you.
         Perhaps, he could make a deal with Red Moon.
         In an instant, Yue Ying approached Li Hao and grabbed at him with one hand. A wave of dark energy gushed out and even formed a huge net, trying to capture Li Hao.
         Even now, Li Hao still didn't move, as if he had been scared silly.
         He was thinking that he might not have such an opportunity in the future.
         Now, everyone was looking down on him.
         Therefore, this peak three yang dared to be so close to a Martial Master, even less than five meters away. But if he survived this time, in the future ... Probably no three yang would dare to be so close to him.
        
         At this moment, the moon Bodhi was getting closer and closer to Li Hao ...
         Li Hao moved!
         At this moment, Yue Ying only felt a blur in front of her eyes. The next moment, an extremely powerful divine intent suddenly struck her mind, as if a fierce tiger had burrowed into her head.
         The next moment, a huge mountain came crashing down.
         Divine decree!
         At this moment, a sword light shone in all directions, illuminating the place.
         On the starry sky sword, a fiery light burst out. Li Hao's sword struck out silently. His divine intent burst out to the extreme, and the two forces merged. Fast, extremely fast, he slashed at Yue Chan!
         Yue Ying's eyes were a little dazed, but she came back to her senses in an instant.
         With a loud roar, he clenched his fist and punched at Li Hao's small sword!
         This guy ... What was going on?
          This was what he thought.
         He was still a little confused about the divine intent attack.
         As for Li Hao, he rarely spoke during battles. At this moment, he let out a low roar to vent the ruthlessness in his heart!
         "Break me!"
         With a shout, the sword light soared into the sky!
         Kachaa!
         With a crisp sound, the bones were broken. Yue Ying's fist was cut by the small sword. Except for the sound of the bones being cut, the next moment, her entire right forearm fell off.
         The small sword didn't stop. It cut off the opponent's right arm and went for the head in an instant.
         At this moment, Yue Ying came back to her senses.
         With a violent roar, he hurriedly dodged, but he was a little too late. With a pfft sound, his entire right arm was directly cut open from the shoulder. Even his waist was cut. One-third of his body was directly cut off.
         There was no pain, it was too fast!
         Before the pain could come, Yue Ying saw her right arm fall off, and her right waist was cut open.
         The defense of the peak three yang realm was like paper at this moment.
         It was directly broken by this sword!
         At least Huang Jie had seen Li Hao kill Yu Xiao, so he paid more attention to Li Hao. However, Yue Ying had never seen Li Hao fight, so she was less wary of Li Hao than Yu Xiao was!
         At this moment, moon Bodhi was terrified. His left arm instantly turned into a Sword of Darkness, and he attacked Li Hao!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was already close to his opponent when he slashed out.
         His left hand was already in the shape of a claw. With a crack, his five fingers penetrated into his opponent's left arm, creating a bloody hole. With a low cry, he crushed the bone.
         He even raised his knee in an instant and struck out!
         BOOM!
         Yue Ying's chest was directly crushed by this knee.
         Li Hao held the sword in his right hand and stabbed it into the man's back.
         Yue Ying's face was filled with shock and confusion ...
         His eyes met Li Hao 's.
         Vicious, merciless, and murderous!
          Did he just enter the warrior of thousand worlds?  He couldn't believe it!
         He was at the peak of three suns.
         In the distance, the five three suns who were flying toward Li Hao at high speed could vaguely see what was going on, but they couldn't see it clearly. They were still flying toward Li Hao instinctively.
         And the next moment, they saw it.
         This time, it was especially clear.
         Li Hao's sword stabbed into her back. At this moment, Yue Ying was bent over, and her internal organs had been shattered by Li Hao's knee. The small sword had even pierced her heart.
         But Li Hao didn't stop.
         His left hand broke the other party's arm forcefully, and he circled around. His arm was like a long-armed ape, and in the blink of an eye, it wrapped around the other party's head, and his left hand was tightly wrapped around his neck.
         With a crack, his neck was broken.
         With a wave of his left hand, a head was flung away and smashed to the side in the dark.
         He was dead!
         The five three suns had almost arrived. They were less than a hundred meters away from Li Hao. At this moment, they saw everything clearly, but they were all confused.
         In the next moment, it turned into shock.
         Yue Ying ... Was dead!
         If he didn't die after his head fell off, he wouldn't be three yang.
         Yue Ying, who was at the peak of the three suns realm, got too close to Li Hao and was killed on the spot in the blink of an eye. Even Li Hao himself felt that it was too fast, but this guy actually got close to him ... Did he not take martial masters seriously?
         The next moment, he stomped the ground and stood up.
         In an instant, the long sword broke through the air and cut a red shadow into two.
         Ignoring the other two red Shadows, Li Hao flew like a bird and headed straight for Yama's group. As for Red moon's group, he didn't care.
         In the blink of an eye, he had arrived.
         Iron wall's expression changed, and the woman beside him let out a shrill cry. A sound wave swept over, and Li Hao roared like a fierce tiger!
         "Roar!"
         The sound wave exploded and swept in all directions, causing the rocks on the ground to shatter.
         At this moment, Li Hao had transformed into a fiery Tiger.
          In the blink of an eye, he was approaching the two.
         As iron wall's expression changed, he roared and a set of heavy earth armor appeared on his body!
         BOOM!
         Li Hao's punch didn't move iron wall's armor, but he soon spat out a mouthful of blood. His internal organs were badly shaken.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Seeing that Li Hao was quickly approaching him, iron wall didn't have time to escape."Come quickly and join forces. This person is already a huge problem ..."
         The red moon's people seemed to be a little hesitant.
         However, he couldn't let Hong Yue's people leave. Li Hao had just killed Yue Ying, which was too shocking. Once Hong Yue's three experts left, he and the woman next to him would most likely die.
         "Quick!" Iron wall shouted."He can't break through my defense quickly. Let's kill him together, or else Crimson Moon will be his biggest enemy ..."
         The three three suns 'expressions changed slightly.
         The next moment, Zheng ping shouted and charged at Li Hao. At the same time, the two remaining red figures also flew toward Li Hao.
        
         Five three yang!
         Two of them were in the late-stage, and two were in the middle-stage ...
         With the addition of the two red Shadows, even if they worked together, Zhan Xuguang might not lose.
         Red Moon and the other two reacted and made a decision immediately. Li Hao ... Was a big problem!
         This was big trouble!
         The second person was Yuan Shuo.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If they couldn't get rid of Li Hao now, Red Moon would probably be met with this guy's crazy revenge. They didn't even have time to be shocked that Li Hao had killed a peak three-Sun Warrior.
         The three three suns were quickly approaching. The earth-type expert in front of him had an extremely strong defense, and the woman was still shrieking and attacking with sound waves ...
         Li Hao's eyes turned cold.
         In an instant, a burst of qi and blood exploded. With a boom, the qi and blood were like air, shining into the starry sky, turning the sky blood red.
          Blood Blade technique!
         In the blink of an eye, divine intent merged. This time, Li Hao didn't use the fusion of two forms on the small sword. Instead, it turned into the golden sword form. Not only that, at this moment, waves rose and fell on Li Hao's small sword!
         Ninth refinement force!
         One stack, two stacks, three stacks ...
         p In the blink of an eye, the eight stacks were completed. The gold sword force was best at explosive breakthroughs, and with the blood Blade Art's fusion of essence, Qi, and spirit, Li Hao was now 30% stronger than when he had just killed Yue Ying.  "Break!"
         As he slashed out with his sword, the red world in the void was cut apart. As the iron wall trembled, the armor of heavy earth on the surface of its body was instantly cut apart with a loud boom!
         It was broken!
         The defense that he thought was invincible was broken by Li Hao's sword.
         "Get lost!"
         With a furious roar, iron wall punched at Li Hao like a thousand mountains. He had also gone crazy. Li Hao wanted to kill him? in his dreams! As long as he could hold on for a while ... When the three Crimson Moon experts arrived, Li Hao would definitely die!
         Bastard!
         This punch was as heavy as a mountain.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had no intention of withdrawing his sword.
         The sword pierced into the head of the iron wall!
         Tie bi also heavily punched Li Hao's body. Boom ... The power of this punch was incomparably strong. In an instant, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and bones and bones were broken. The battle between the two ended in an instant, accompanied by the screams of the woman next to him.
         Iron wall's head was pierced through, and a bloody hole appeared on Li Hao's chest, revealing his heart. His heart was wriggling, and some cracks appeared, but they quickly healed.
         His heart had almost been pierced through.
         The woman's eyes were no longer charming, only fear and panic.
         Fear instantly occupied all his thoughts.
         She stopped screaming and turned to escape.
          She couldn't care less about the three suns behind Li Hao, who had already arrived. She only had one thought: escape!  Iron wall, who was good at defense, was in the late stage of the three suns realm, but he was killed by one sword strike, let alone her.
         She was only at the middle stage of the three yang realm and she was not good at attacking. Sound waves were her strongest attack and she had another superpower, which was to create illusions ... But she tried it and before the illusion appeared, she was directly broken by a fierce tiger!
         Therefore, she, a half-auxiliary system three yang, simply couldn't display her strength.
         She wanted to escape, but Li Hao wouldn't let her.
         At this moment, Li Hao transformed into a bird and disappeared.
         The Golden origin gathered on his arm, golden sword force!
         Li Hao's sword pierced through the back of her head like a bird's beak, instantly breaking through all her defenses. Li Hao's inner strength gushed out, and with a boom, her beautiful head exploded. The shrieking in the air had not completely disappeared.
         Triple kill!
         In the blink of an eye, Li Hao had killed his third target.
         At this moment, there was a loud boom behind him. A powerful metal element force exploded behind him, causing Li Hao to stagger and fall to the ground. Li Hao rolled like an ape and rolled a few times on the ground. He was covered in blood, but he had already avoided the second attack.
         The three suns of the Crimson Moon were here!
         The two red Shadows instantly squeezed into Li Hao's internal organs. Li Hao's qi and blood boiled. With a muffled groan, the blood Shadows were directly melted by him, emitting a sharp sound.
         On the other side, Zheng ping and the other two's expressions changed slightly.
         The shadow God had been killed by him just like that?
         It was too fast. Everything happened too fast. As soon as they arrived, iron wall, who was good at defense, was killed by Li Hao, and Mei Ji, who was good at sound waves, had her head blown up.
         Yue Ying, who was good at assassination, had died long ago!
         In less than 10 seconds, the man in front of him had killed all the three suns of the flying heavens and the Yama.
         The bloody hole was still there.
         Behind him, a bloody hole had been created by Zheng Ping's explosion, and Li Hao's body had been pierced through. He could even see the other side through some parts of his body.
         But this young man in front of her was still fierce!
          There was only ruthlessness in his eyes!
         Zheng ping and the others swallowed their saliva. At this moment, there was only one thought in their minds ... If this fellow didn't die today, he would be even more difficult to deal with in the future than Yuan Shuo!
         The injured Li Hao ... Was the perfect opportunity for them to kill him!
         "Kill!"
         The three of them didn't retreat. As the three suns, they understood that if they ran away, they would die. Didn't they see Mei Ji's fate?
         Escaping was courting death.
         If a Martial Master caught up to him at close range and he couldn't go all out, his defense could be easily broken ... Then he was just waiting for death.
         Take his life while he's down!
         At this moment, the three of them no longer had any thoughts of holding back. This person must be killed. Everyone had underestimated him. Tonight's battle was his plan. He had long been prepared to kill the three suns.
         [PS: I want to finish writing, but I'm too tired. I'll continue in the afternoon.]
        
         In front of him, Li Hao was half-kneeling on the ground.
         He was panting slightly, and his heartbeat was visible to the naked eye.
         The three three suns rapidly approached. Metal, water, and fire elements.
         Li Hao was injured.
         He was severely injured!
         However, even if the three suns approached, the mysterious energy would have exploded before they even arrived. Li Hao didn't think of escaping.
         Why did he escape?
         This time, it was to kill them, to kill them all and make himself stronger.
         A wave of water surged out!
         Ninth refinement force!
          BOOM!
         A punch was thrown across the air. With a boom, superpowers exploded. Li Hao stomped on the ground and flew into the sky. The next moment, he fell from the sky and shook the nine Continents with his sword!
         From all four directions, the three suns rapidly attacked!
         The metal element was the strongest, while the water element was the weakest.
         Li Hao, however, didn't fight Water-type creatures, but focused on metal-type creatures. With a wave of his sword, he once again tore apart the metal-type creatures. Zheng ping was slightly startled, while the other two quickly charged at him.
         At this moment, no one spoke.
         He didn't need to say anything.
         It was a battle where one of them would die.
         With a boom, a wave of water energy exploded around Li Hao. The next moment, it formed a bubble that wrapped around Li Hao.
         Li Hao pierced the bubble with his sword and welcomed a sky full of flames!
         The three three suns had a tacit understanding.
         The trouble and damage they caused to Li Hao were even greater than the previous ones.
         Li Hao wasn't weak at all. With the bloody blade art, he was at the peak of his combat power. However, he was still surrounded by the three suns and couldn't move forward.
         And these three people wouldn't let him land.
         Li Hao tried to land on the ground several times to adjust himself, but he was still attacked by the three of them. Zheng ping and the others also had grave expressions. This guy was already in such a state, but he still had such a powerful attack.
         If they had not been injured earlier, they would not have been able to resist.
         "Phew ..."
         Panting sounds could be heard from the four of them. They were all panting. Such a high-intensity and explosive battle was something that they couldn't bear.
         Li Hao's blood flowed like a stream. The power of the red shadow in his body had not been completely absorbed and digested. He had only absorbed a portion of it. The remaining power actually hindered the circulation of his inner strength. After all, it was a red shadow at the three suns realm, and not the early stage.
         In the distance, there was also a battle.
         Those were the three great organizations "sun glory powerhouses, chasing after the three suns, but were intercepted by the demon hunt squads. At this moment, they were also fighting.
         The killing was silent.
         Whether it was the three great organizations or the demon hunt squads, except for the sounds of explosions and secret techniques, they were all fighting in complete silence. Only in the instant of death could one hear the sounds of pain.
         They were all elites!
         As for Li Hao, he didn't care about that.
          At that moment, he put away the starry sky sword.  Although the starry sky sword was sharp, it was too short and not very handy. Besides its sharpness, only a sword was what Li Hao needed, and it was a bit of a hindrance at this moment.
         He instantly withdrew his starry sky sword and waved his fist in the next moment!
         Tiger fighting technique!
         Roaring like a tiger, his breathing technique changed to the ninth-refinement force when he was halfway through his punch!
         Burst!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
         This punch was even more powerful than the previous one. Li Hao broke the bubble with one punch and leaped into the air. The Water-type three suns continued to trap Li Hao, but Li Hao suddenly roared and released himself like a tiger out of its cage!
         A fierce tiger possessed Li Hao. He transformed into a fierce tiger and soared into the air, jumping higher and higher!
         "He's trying to escape!"
         ? Zheng ping roared,"chase!"
         Li Hao wanted to escape!
         Escape?
         How could Li Hao escape? the next moment, he stomped his foot like Mount Tai. With one stomp, his superpower exploded. The mysterious Water-type superpower was directly shattered by his Stomp!
         That Water-type super was at the mid-stage of the three yang realm. Now that his power was destroyed by Li Hao's stomp, he spat out a mouthful of blood in shock.
         This works too?
         Mountain?
         At this moment, Li Hao was like a huge mountain that was pressing down on them.
         They all looked extremely serious and attacked one after another. Just as they were about to stop the mountain from falling, Li Hao's foot exploded, and a metal-elemental force burst forth. Like a bird's beak, it was extremely sharp and instantly pierced through the water-Elemental expert's defense. His foot was like a sword, and his opponent's shoulder instantly caved in!
         Li Hao didn't show any mercy. He kicked with his legs and spread his arms. Like a bird, he circled in the air and swept in all directions!
         Bang Bang Bang!
         A series of explosions and the sound of metal colliding rang out. Li Hao was like a tireless beast. He kicked the weakest fire mage away and instantly landed on the ground, cracking the earth with his foot.
         Blood seeped out and dyed the ground red.
         Li Hao's leather boots were completely shattered, revealing his white bones.
         "Pfft!"
          Li Hao spat out a mouthful of blood and panted heavily. Three other superpowers attacked him from all directions again, each of them with some injuries.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was a little tired.
         The ninth-refinement force ... Had not broken through even after a long time.
         Breaking through during a battle ... It was easy to describe in books, but in a real battle, there was not much time to think and break through. This made Li Hao very depressed. He had originally wanted to take the opportunity to break through the nine-fold realm, condense water force, and merge the three forces. Wouldn't it be easy to kill a few three-Suns?
         But now ... It was proven that it was not possible.
         Li Hao spat out a mouthful of blood and laughed. Forget it, I won't force it.
         Since he couldn't make a breakthrough during the battle ... Then he would use the gold melting force and the third force, the gold sword force!
         The golden sword force was very powerful. Previously, Li Hao had planned to strengthen his lungs before fusing with it, but who cared about that now?
         He'll cough a little more, just like hou Xiaochen and the others.
         When his five internal organs were balanced again and could accommodate the metal sword force, it would naturally be better.
        
         The next moment, a surge of metal-elemental energy exploded in his lungs. The Super Lock made a clanging sound as it was cut and almost split open.
         But Li Hao didn't care, because this was the perfect time. The power of the red shadow in his body rushed into his lungs and strengthened the Super Lock.
         He was originally worried that he had no way to digest the red shadow power.
         The crack on the Super Lock was quickly healed.
         A wave of metal-elemental power quickly erupted from Li Hao's body. Zheng ping and the other two's expressions changed. Zheng ping roared,""Quickly kill them!"
         Li Hao seemed to have undergone a special change.
         At this moment, Li Hao's lungs were pounding, blood spurted out, and he coughed.
         "Cough, cough, cough ..."
         Blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.
         Melting gold sword force was the most difficult.
          However, the gold sword force represented the ultimate explosiveness. If it was integrated into his body, Li Hao's strength would definitely increase greatly.
         The starry sky sword reappeared. The sword energy in it was instantly absorbed by Li Hao, and his injuries began to heal quickly. They stopped expanding, and the injuries to his internal organs also healed quickly.
         Like a fawn, Li Hao's steps were light, and with a flash, he disappeared under Zheng Ping's sword.
         The next moment, Zheng ping felt a chill down his spine!
         At this moment, Li Hao's divine will emerged, and the sword attack of his ancestor flashed in his mind!
         Three sword forces!
         The Golden origin instantly merged into the Tiger's head, and the Tiger was released from its cage!
         Buzzzzzz!
         The air exploded as he thrust his sword forward. The sword Qi shot out in all directions and the ground cracked.
         Li Hao's speed was extremely fast. In an instant, the starry sky sword was thrust out. Zheng Ping's expression changed, and he quickly dodged. Just as he was about to Dodge the sword, Li Hao stomped his foot, and the earth trembled, sending him flying back!
         Puchi!
         The sword pierced through Li Hao's back, and his body was hit by both water and fire attacks. The two supers didn't even care if Zheng ping was in their attack range and attacked him together!
         BOOM!
         An explosion sounded, and Zheng Ping's eyes widened. His body was covered in flames, and the water arrow had pierced through him.
         He managed to turn his head to look at Li Hao. At this moment, Li Hao's hand was holding a dagger that had been deeply stabbed into his heart. His face was unrecognizable, and his body was covered in wounds.
         Zheng ping suddenly laughed.
         He didn't care that his companions were also attacking him. At this time, if it were him, he would also do the same.
         He laughed. Li Hao had underestimated superpowers!
         Although this guy had become much stronger in an instant, appeared behind him in an instant, and pierced his heart with a sword ... He was not in a good state either. The attack of the three suns was not so easy to take.
         Li Hao had been determined to kill him, but he had been seriously injured by those two!
         However, the next moment, his eyes widened!
         Li Hao took a deep breath, and a special energy quickly exploded in his body. His body, which had just been burned, instantly flashed with rays of light. In the blink of an eye, his injuries didn't heal, but they didn't worsen. New flesh and blood even began to grow.
         Sword energy!
         Li Hao looked at him coldly and punched him. With a bang, his head exploded!
         What are you looking at?  What are you laughing at?
         Li Hao didn't know what he was laughing about. Did you think that you couldn't do anything just because I was injured?
         When the two three suns saw this, they flew away without a word!
         If Li Hao, who was heavily injured, could recover in an instant, what was the point of fighting?
         Escape!
         They hadn't fled earlier because Li Hao was seriously injured. But now, they watched as Li Hao took a deep breath and recovered ... How could they fight?
         Li Hao took a deep breath and changed his breathing technique again!
         A Qi sword was spat out!
         Shadowless Sword!
         The energy sword was extremely fast. In an instant, it pierced through the void. The water super who had just risen up was pierced through the back by this sword. He staggered and fell to the ground.
         The fire element Three yang initial stage cultivator had already taken to the air and was about to fly away.
         At this moment, Li Hao pulled out his sword, and the three swords merged into one!
         The sound of coughing was like a death signal."Break!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com I'll end your life!
         Buzzzzzz!
         The sword Qi soared into the sky and lit up the earth. At this moment, this sword pierced through the heaven and earth. With a boom, the sword Qi disappeared. In the air, the fire elemental three suns stopped in their tracks. Then, they looked down with some bitterness ... With a boom, their bodies exploded!
         As for the water element Three suns that fell to the ground, they were still alive, but their faces were filled with fear!
         He was dead!
         They were all dead!
         Five out of the six three suns died in the blink of an eye!
         ,m "The demonic sword ..."  The water element Three suns muttered. This person ... Was even stronger than Yuan Shuo.
         At the very least, Li Hao was indeed stronger than Yuan Shuo when he killed eyebrows-abrest stick.
         He had a vicious look on his face. The moment Li Hao approached, he suddenly pounced at Li Hao, intending to counterattack before his death. Even if he couldn't kill Li Hao, he would at least heavily injure him!
          As for Li Hao, he stood on the ground like a giant bear and directly opened his arms, allowing his opponent to pounce on him. He hugged his opponent and used bear fighting technique, increasing the strength of his arms by countless times.
         BOOM!
         Kill!
         His arms were like iron hoops that bound his opponent and killed him on the spot. His arms were broken, his sternum was crushed, and his internal organs were completely crushed. His head drooped, but he still looked at Li Hao.
         Why?
         Why was he so strong?
         Why could his injuries recover in an instant?
         Why?
         He didn't understand these things, he didn't know, and he died unwillingly.
         Li Hao didn't have the time to guess what he was thinking. He shook off the three suns of water, whose bones were broken, and looked around. He looked in one direction, and the next moment, he stomped on the ground and slashed at the air!
        
         In the air, a superpower master who had retracted his superpower and had a fearful expression did not move. He only hoped that the dark night could cover his tracks.
         However ... The next moment, the sword Qi attacked!
         With a pffft sound, it shattered on the spot!
         Li Hao didn't stop. He landed, stomped on the ground, and flew into the sky. With a stomp, an area of the ground collapsed with a boom, and a sunlit cultivator exploded on the spot!
         Li Hao didn't stop. With a deafening roar, a person seemed to be squeezed out of the darkness from another void. He roared in disbelief,""Impossible!"
         This was one of Fei Tian's assassins. He wasn't very strong, but his ability was extremely special. He could hide in the darkness and become one with the darkness, making it impossible for others to discover him.
         He had even assassinated three suns before. He was also an extremely talented flying heaven genius who had the potential to become the next three suns or even sunguang.
         But now, he couldn't believe it after Li Hao shouted.
         Li Hao didn't wait for him to finish speaking. He punched out, and with a boom, the other party was smashed into pieces.
         Impossible?
          There were so many suns in front of me, so what was impossible?
         If you can hide from my eyes, then you say it's impossible.
         He looked around and found that there were no more orbs of light. However, Li Hao knew that some people had escaped long ago. This battle couldn't be hidden. When he killed Yue Ying, he had sensed that there were several sunlit cultivators nearby. They knew how terrifying Li Hao was and had run away.
         After such a long battle, Li Hao couldn't track where those guys had gone.
         It was impossible to block the news.
         Killing these few people was only because of these few guys, but they actually watched until the end. They were really courting death!
         However, only the few from before managed to escape.
         Those people only saw him kill Yue Ying in an instant because of a sneak attack. His sword could heal injuries, and he had combined the three sword forces into one. These people didn't see it, which made Li Hao feel more at ease.
         Also, these people probably didn't see the explosion of the blood Blade technique.
         It was still alright.
         A moment later, a group of black-armored people quickly arrived. Liu Long, who was covered in blood, said in a low voice,"All the attacking supers were killed, but ... Some of them escaped in the dark. A few earth elemental escaped underground and we couldn't catch them."
         Those who were killed were only those who remained.
         Those who escaped had no choice.
         At this moment, everyone was looking at Li Hao with fervent admiration.
         He fought six three suns and killed all of them!
         Li Hao laughed. The next moment, he raised his hand, waved his fist, and shouted,""Demon hunting!"
         "Demon hunting!"
         His roar reverberated through the wasteland!
         On this night, Li Hao would definitely be famous!
         There was another big Shot among the martial masters, and he even surpassed Yuan Shuo. Li Hao was too young, and his battle record was too shocking. He had killed all six of them by himself!
         In the distance, when they heard this roar, some of the Espers who were escaping were scared out of their wits!
         Escape!
         Escape with no regard for their lives!
         Li Hao had won!
         The three large organizations, six supers, and more than ten sunlit soldiers surrounded them. Li Hao led his men and killed all three suns. Less than five supers managed to escape. The rest were all buried in this nameless mountain.
         ……  In the wilderness.
         Their killing intent shook the heavens. Although they clearly didn't have many battles, at this moment, the demon hunt squads were especially crazy, especially fanatical, as if they couldn't wait to follow Li Hao and kill their way to the central region.
         This was their guild leader!
         One person killing six three suns ... It was the same battle, not a cumulative kill!
         The three suns, the big shots in their eyes.
         But tonight, a group of them had died here.
         Li Hao coughed and said,"collect the corpses and clean up the battlefield. Hurry up!" Retreat ... I'll give you 10 minutes to retreat with me. This time ... We're going to escape ... Soon, there might be sunguang coming after me ..."
         "Cough, cough, cough!"
         The sound of coughing could be heard. At this moment, some people thought of hou Xiaochen.
         However, when he saw Li Hao, hou Xiaochen was instantly forgotten.
         So what if it was hou Xiaochen?
         Could he compare to Li Hao at his age?
         Moreover, hou Xiaochen was hou Xiaochen, and Li Hao was the one who led them to slaughter and grow stronger.
         In the blink of an eye, these people scattered and began to clean up the battlefield.
         Six three suns, the few sunlit ones that were killed ...
         After this battle, the gains would definitely not be small.
         Most of the three suns carried storage rings, which was far from what the sunlight could compare with. They had divine power stones, storage rings, and even themselves. After they were killed, they would have more than a thousand cubic meters of mysterious energy.
         Ten minutes later, Li Hao waved his hand, and the 51 people quickly retreated in the dark.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com ……
         Not long after they left.
         The news spread quickly along with the Espers who fled.
         It was an earthquake!
         ……
         At the Crimson Moon stronghold.
         LAN Yue was slightly dazed and lost in thought. Looking at the strong people in the room, she did not know what to say for a moment.
          Some people did not hear the contents of the communication and were looking at him.
         LAN Yue's face was filled with shock. At this moment, she couldn't even care about hou Xiaochen, the suppression from the four organizations, or the fact that they were sweeping through the area ...
         He was in a daze.
         "LAN Yue!"
         The purple moon's voice woke him up.
         "What's the matter?"Ziyue frowned.
         LAN Yue felt a little thirsty and swallowed her saliva to moisten her throat. She then slowly said,""On the other side of the transverse Canyon ... Zheng ping and the others have caught up to Li Hao ..."
         This was a good thing!
         Everyone was puzzled.
         In the next moment, LAN Yue smiled. Her smile was a little strange."Then ... The flying Moon Bodhi, the Yama's iron wall, and Mei Ji arrived ... The six three suns joined forces to capture Li Hao ..."
        
         Everyone was waiting for the result.
         The next moment, LAN Yue sat on a chair, leaned back, and exhaled.""They're all dead!"
         BOOM!
         Everyone was shocked.
         "Yueshu and the others dared to attack Zheng ping ..." Zi Yue was also shocked.
         Yes, that was his first thought.
         Internal strife!
         It wasn't an internal conflict. It could only be said that the three major organizations had a conflict that led to mutual destruction.
         LAN Yue smiled bitterly.""No... They were all killed by Li Hao!"
         "What?"
          ,m He couldn't believe it. He couldn't believe this result.  LAN Yue's smile disappeared and she exhaled gently. A fan appeared in her hand and she fanned it as if to calm the restlessness in her heart. She regained her calm. "They're all dead. Yue Ying was killed by Li Hao at the first moment. It didn't take long for Li Hao to kill Yue Ying ... Then, a great battle broke out. Someone saw him kill the tough iron wall with a single sword strike ... Then ... There's no then!"
         "Everyone says that Yuan Shuo is powerful, and hou Xiaochen is fearsome ... But why hasn't anyone mentioned that Li Hao is as fearsome as him?"
         Has anyone ever said that?
         No, there wasn 't.
         No one had ever said that Yuan Shuo's disciple was an expert. Whenever Li Hao was mentioned, he would always be described as "Yuan Shuo's last disciple,""the only successor of the eight great families ..."
         But no one had ever said that Li Hao was very powerful!
         Otherwise, this battle would not have ended up like this.
         He had used the lives of six three suns and hundreds of supers to prove Li Hao's strength.
         In that instant, the entire Hall fell silent.
         They were all absorbing and digesting this information, all of them wearing an expression of disbelief.
         Li Hao ... Was Yuan Shuo's disciple!
         Last month, he had only fought with the disciple of the eyebrows-abrest stick and barely won.
         Did he hide his strength last month, or did he really improve to such a terrifying extent in less than a month?
         He must be hiding his strength!
         They didn't believe, didn't believe, that someone could really go from breaking a hundred points to instantly become strong enough to kill six three suns ... With such strength, even if he had launched a surprise attack and everyone had underestimated him, Li Hao was definitely at the top of the three suns!
         He might even be able to fight against Xu Guang!
         At this moment, the entire Red Moon organization fell silent, trying to digest the news. Purple Moon was even more so. Among all the people present, she was the only one who had actually been in contact with Li Hao for a while.
         Previously, when he went to the remains ...
         Was Li Hao really that terrifying back then?
         At that time, Li Hao had seemed simple and honest. Now that she thought about it, was the Li Hao she saw really the same Li Hao who had killed six people and three suns tonight?
         ……
         A wild tide quickly swept through the Silver Moon land.
         The night patrolman.
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Chief Steward Yu came out with a pale face.  At this moment, the entire night watchman was in an uproar. Hao lianchuan's face was full of shock and he was dumbfounded. He reported in a daze,""Minister ... Li Hao ... Li Hao killed six three suns in the silver North Region tonight. One of them was at the peak of the three suns, two were at the late stage, two were at the middle stage, and one was at the early stage ... The news has spread. The rising sun from the three major organizations has appeared and seems to be heading to the silver North ..."
         Hou Xiaochen was silent as he read through the information. After a while, he said softly,"Some escaped superpowers said that Li Hao is a demonic sword. What do you think?"
         What do I think?
         I don't have the eyes to see it!
         Hao lianchuan's face was blank and he did not say a word.
         It was not a one-on-one killing three suns. If it was, he would not have been so stunned after seeing it last time.
         It was one against six, and Li Hao had killed all of them!
         This was what was terrifying!
         He even wondered if Li Hao could take on Xuguang by himself.
         If the six three suns joined forces, they could probably fight against Xuguang, right?
         There should be no problem!
         But ... They were all killed by Li Hao.
         No matter how many accidents there were, it was a fact that Li Hao won.
         "Minister ... Rescue?"
         "Rescue?"
         Hou Xiaochen coughed and laughed,"I won 't!" You, immediately go and find the others and join forces to sweep through the yinnan region! Not only you, Xiao Yu will go as well. I will act according to the circumstances. I will call the others ... And sweep the entire yinnan!"
         Do you need help?
         Wouldn't that be like following the three major organizations?
         As long as they quickly swept through silver South, the three great organizations would have a hard time dealing with them. They had to make a choice between going north of the transverse Canyon to kill Li Hao or joining forces to resist the Silver Moon officials.
         This was the best way!
         "Mobilize the Wei Wu Army ... Li Hao's Demon Hunter Army has made a name for itself this time. It won't be long before even the central region knows about Li Hao and this newly formed Demon Hunter Army ... Jin Jin, you've been dormant for too long. It's time for you to show your face!"
         Hou Xiaochen stood up and looked towards the North with a smile.
         Li Hao!
          You ... Can really do it!
         I knew it. A guy who can break through my soul-splitting spear will is not simple. You have indeed hidden most of your strength. You have finally exploded it tonight. It seems that you are not going to continue pretending.
         Hao lianchuan did not say anything more and left quickly.
         He was going to contact all parties immediately and start a big raid!
         They had to force the three major organizations to leave their elites to the South of the transverse Canyon. Otherwise, it would be difficult for Li Hao's group to escape.
         As for the rescue ... It was too dangerous.
         The three major organizations might have already sealed off the cross-section Canyon area. If he went there rashly, he might get stuck in a quagmire.
         ……
         At the administration Bureau.
         Under the dim light, director Zhao coughed and looked at Deputy Director Zhou,""Yuan Shuo's disciple ... Sure enough, Yuan Shuo isn't someone to be trifled with, and his disciple isn't someone to be trifled with either. The bloodline of the eight great families, if it really erupts, it's not something an ordinary person can withstand ..."
        
         "Why is your grandson involved in this?"
         "Him?"
         Deputy Director Zhou laughed."He's just curious. Plus, his family is strict, so he wanted some excitement. This time, he was probably scared out of his wits. The few of them are probably running back for their lives ..."
         "Now, the three major organizations are going to Yin bei to hunt down Li Hao ... Those little guys are in danger."
         Deputy Director Zhou shook his head."It's fine. I didn't hear about them participating tonight. They probably got the news and ran away. Li Hao and the others are martial masters and can hide, but they aren 't. They'll probably run back once the battle starts."
         Director Zhao also nodded slightly. From Li Hao's background, he should have thought of this. This person was someone who planned for the future and would not let those people be exposed and killed.
         "Some people say that Li Hao is a demonic sword ... What do you think?"
         Deputy Director Zhou took a deep breath."I don't know if it's a demonic sword or not. I only know that ... After this battle, Silver Moon is going to be the center of everyone's attention again. This master and disciple pair are afraid that no one will pay attention to Silver Moon, so they're trying to stir up some trouble."
         "That's right. Both the north and south are killing people. Yuan Shuo killed a peak three suns expert tonight and escaped ... Originally, he would have attracted some attention, but now, no one will care about him. They will only be concerned about his disciple, that fellow who has reached the peak of three suns even though he has just appeared!"
         Director Zhao was filled with emotions.
          Young people were really scary.
         And do you know Yuan Shuo?
         "Your student's growth is terrifying. His battle record is even starting to surpass yours. You dawdled for so many days and killed some third Suns, but Li Hao has already killed eight third Suns!
         No, perhaps even more.
         Zhang Ting was dead, and Hao lianchuan said that he didn't do it. So, it must be Li Hao?
         Nine three suns?
         Was there still unknown three yang?
         It was fine if master and disciple didn't attack, but the moment they did, the three suns experts, who used to be high and mighty, became clowns that could be killed at will. In the blink of an eye, they had killed dozens of three suns experts on the Silver Moon land!
         ……
         All parties were shaken!
         The news also spread like crazy.
         The demonic sword Li Hao!
         Old demon Yuan's last disciple had killed six three suns in Silver Moon today, stepping on the corpses of the three major organizations to become famous!
         ……
         Central region.
         After crossing the North Sea, the first province was called haiyao province.
         At this moment, the hurricane-like news spread rapidly.
         Yuan Shuo had just killed a three suns expert and was currently on the run. The place he was hiding at was not ordinary. He had killed a group of supers in passing and was hiding in one of the FEI Tian's strongholds.
         At this moment, a line of information suddenly appeared on a mirror.
         Yuan Shuo, who was in the midst of healing, raised his head and looked over. Suddenly, his mouth opened wide.
         Jadesword, who was also recuperating, heard the commotion and turned to look at Yuan Shuo. Seeing the latter's mouth wide open and his dazed expression, he was bewildered. The enemy is here?
          Following Yuan Shuo's line of sight, he saw words appearing on the mirror.  "Emergency tip-off:
         Something big happened in Silver Moon province tonight. Yuan Shuo's disciple, Li Hao, fought six three suns in the North of Silver Moon and killed our Sky Realm expert, Yue tan. He also killed jinjiu, Duan Chao, and Zheng ping from the red moon organization and iron wall and Mei Ji from Yama organization.
         The danger level of Silver Moon increased. Previously, Li Hao had led the Demon Hunter Army and 50 martial masters to kill over a hundred supers. His killing nature far surpassed Yuan Shuo 's!
         Li Hao's danger level has increased. It is recommended to report it and promote it to "Sunglow threat." If members accept Li Hao's mission, it is recommended that they have the strength of at least the middle stage of the Sunglow realm. "
         Wu Hongjun also widened his eyes and suddenly looked at Yuan Shuo.
         His face was blank!
         This ... Is he talking about your student?
         The obedient, sensible, and cultured Li Hao?
         That's right, this was what Yuan Shuo had been saying.
         In the impression of Wu honggui, his student was indeed a gentle child. He was cultured, well-behaved, and loved to smile ...
         And then ... What was this?
         Same name?
         It just so happens that even your name, Yuan Shuo, is the same, right?
         He killed six three suns in one battle!
         At this moment, Yuan Shuo also came back to his senses. His face was dull. After a moment, he restored his calm. Seeing Wu Hongjun looking at him, he smiled and said,""Why are you looking at me?"
         "Your disciple?"
         "Yeah, what's wrong?"
         "You ... You said it so well-behaved?"
         "Yeah, aren't you obedient?"
         Yuan Shuo laughed out loud. As he laughed, he felt a little helpless."Stop looking. I don't know how this kid improved so fast. I know that he can fight Qian very quickly and even match the three suns ... But ... But ... Damn it, how would I know that he can fight one against six and win!"
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He then said speechlessly,'this kid ... Is in big trouble! I'm here, and it's not easy for everyone to not care about him. Great, he stole my limelight, and now he's more dangerous than me!"
         What was this?
         Who was covering who?
         Also, how did this kid do it?
         Yuan Shuo couldn't figure it out. At this moment, he might be able to do what Li Hao did, but ... But his three stances had already appeared and fused. The only thing he couldn't do was use the blood saber art ... He had no choice, as he didn't have sword energy.
         If he used it carelessly and didn't get the blood shadow in time, he would be finished.
         Therefore, he would not use it recklessly.
         Even so, he was still ridiculously strong. Not to mention that he could match the rising sun, among the three suns, he felt that he was invincible and an existence that could sweep away everything.
         And his own disciple didn't seem to be bad either!
         Wu Hongjun took a deep breath,"your apprentice ... Is incredible!" However, even Feitian has sent a message to everyone. I'm afraid the entire dynasty will know how powerful your disciple is tonight. This is not a good thing. "
