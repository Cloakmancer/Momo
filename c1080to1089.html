        such impossible requests?"
        Xu Qing, however, shook his head. He rose into the air and caught up with Li Hao again."The Xu family actually knows a lot about the three major organizations. The Xu family has also provided a lot of financial assistance to the Yama. I'm not afraid of you knowing that the Xu family is also part of the Yama ... But the red moon is the strongest of the three major organizations! Not only was she the most powerful, but she was also the most mysterious. Apart from her, Ying Hongyue was probably the most terrifying existence among the leaders of the three great organizations! This person, according to the supernatural, should have completely entered level six. He might even be at the peak of level six!"
        "Even if I unseal my battle-power, I'm still 99% not his match ..."
        "But if you're willing to help me, then that's not certain!" Also, if you want revenge, you're thinking too simply. Ying Hongyue was able to rise to power partly because of her talent and partly because of her strength, but the most important thing is that she's not alone!"
        "Your master was strong back then, right? However, why couldn't he seize the opportunity to rise up and be surpassed by others? This was the outcome of being alone! Be it the three great organizations, the nine divisions, the royal family, or the Wang family, weren't they all powerful forces? Ying Hongyue also has the support of an expert ... And it even involves some top secrets. The things you're seeing now are only what everyone wants you to see. The real situation is much more complicated than this!"
        Xu Qing said softly,"just like my Xu family. Li Hao, you don't think that the Xu family's Foundation in suppressing the East is only me and a few generals, do you?" "You caused such a ruckus at the Xu estate so suddenly that the Xu family didn't react quickly. This is because the Xu family has been peaceful for too long, and they're a little slow ... But you have to know, who would treat the land above as their core business? Ruins, ancient cities, these are the places where some strong people will only be stationed all year round!"
        "I'm telling you all this to make you understand that you've taken the Windchaser's boots and now you're causing trouble in the high Duke's public house. If you don't want to cooperate, then even if I don't kill you, you won't be able to escape death!"
        Li Hao was slightly shocked.
        Really?
         Fake?
        What Xu Qing meant was that the Xu family might not have so many powerhouses. Most of the powerhouses were in the legacy site or the ancient city.
        These people and these forces seemed to be the same.
        For example, Red Moon was said to have an ancient Divine Guard.
        They had always been exploring the ruins and rarely showed themselves.
        The ruins ...
        Li Hao had explored very few relics, but in two of them, he had found experts from the ancient civilizations. If he could find the little tree, why couldn't these people find it?
        How could it be so coincidental that Li Hao had discovered it?
        Xu Qing continued,"not only can we work together, but the existence behind us can also work together!" The method you used to kill Redbeard ... Should be the origin avatar, right? You're really working with an ancient monster plant, right? The kuishan Imperial Palace might be fake, but you must have seen the ancient Fey plant. Is it in heaven battling city? It seems that the people from the eight great families are more popular. In fact, we have also encountered such existences, but we were unable to get close to them, and we were unable to cooperate ..."  Li Hao didn't say anything. He just shuttled back and forth at an extremely fast speed.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com On one hand, Xu Qing was trying to shake him up, and on the other hand, he was trying to numb Li Hao. This guy's speed had obviously increased a little just now, and the distance between him and Li Hao had shortened from four to five kilometers to only about three kilometers.
        With a breakthrough, Li Hao instantly traversed more than 2000 meters, widening the distance again.
        Of course, a large amount of his inner strength was also instantly consumed.
        In the back, Xu Qing frowned in anger. He couldn't even use the Xu family's treasure, but Li Hao was using it with great enthusiasm, and ... The effect was amazing!
        The distance to break through in this instant was too long.
        If he could use it, then if he met someone of the same level, he could instantly break through and kill the enemy. Would the other party be able to stop him?
        Li Hao only used it to escape, but in Xu Qing's eyes, this pair of boots was a deadly weapon. In the world of martial arts, only speed could not be broken!
         Xu Qing sped up again ... This time, even his five internal organs trembled slightly, and his qi and blood surged up. He felt as if he was about to unseal himself. This speed had already exceeded his limits.
        If this continued, he might be able to unseal his combat strength.
        "Li Hao, don't force me. You're a Silver Moon Martial Master. You should know that once I unseal your five internal organs, you'll die for sure!"
        In front, Li Hao smiled and said,"come!" You can try! The barefooted aren't afraid of wearing shoes. I'm all alone, so if I die, I die. What about you? The Duke of the Xu family, the Overlord of the East, can you seal him again after you've been unsealed? Do you think that you can seal me just because you have my sword? You've had the Windchaser's boots for so many years, can you use them? Moreover, it's the number one divine sword. Are you as stupid as those outsiders?"
        Xu Qing remained silent.
        This was also something that he was more afraid of than others. Because he had owned it before, he knew how difficult it was for outsiders to master the eight divine weapons. It was definitely not something that could be done in an instant. Even if they could, they would need time to observe and slowly grind.
        "Li Hao, don't forget that the divine sword isn't the only way to recover the five internal organs. If you have enough spring of life and blood God, you can do it too! Do you think the Xu family has any spring of life or Blood God in reserve?"
        "Then you can come!"
        Li Hao laughed."You've unsealed it. Even if you do, how much do you have?" How long could it last? After unsealing it, would it be able to suppress it? The more powerful it is, the harder it is to suppress!"
       
        Are you threatening me?
        I'm not afraid!
        ,m Of course, the Xu family definitely had the spring of life. It was just that Xu Qing couldn't make up his mind at the moment. Li Hao was also a little nervous. If this old fellow really didn't care about it and the seal was really unsealed ... It would be troublesome!  Seeing that they were getting further and further away, Li Hao felt a headache.
        The sword energy was consumed extremely quickly!
        He did not have enough time to replenish his sword energy. Fortunately, he had absorbed a lot of it previously and had stored a lot of it when he was healing the light sword. Otherwise, he would not have had the time to replenish his sword energy.
        In just a short while, he had already run two to three hundred miles.
        As he thought about this, Li Hao changed direction again. Xu Qing frowned. He was even more certain that Li Hao had the heavenly eye. This kind of person was indeed difficult to deal with.
        His eyes were filled with killing intent!
        There were powerhouses from the high Duke's public house lying in ambush in front of them. However, at this moment, their plan was once again nullified.
         "Only martial masters ... Have a chance of avoiding his detection!"
        Xu Qing knew in his heart that these heavenly eye cultivators were often very effective in observing superpowers, but their effect on martial masters was barely satisfactory. At the current stage, those who ambushed him were all superpowers and would not be able to achieve anything.
        After thinking for a while, Xu Qing checked his communication Jade again.
        It would be very difficult to deal with or stop Li Hao with just superpowers.
        Not long after the message was sent out by the communication Jade.
        Li Hao, who was running away, suddenly felt his scalp go numb. He looked around and found no superpowers except for Xu Qing, who was following him. Could he be a Martial Master?
        He was a little vigilant!
        Were there still powerful Martial Master powerhouses on the side of the Duke of dingguo?
        Just as he was thinking, the Black Panther on his back suddenly stood up."Woof, Woof, Woof!"
        The Black Panther quickly roared!
        Li Hao's expression changed. At this moment, three Cannonball-like objects suddenly shot toward Li Hao from the sky, as if they had locked onto him.
        Behind him, Xu Qing looked on coldly.
        Li Hao, you're underestimating a major force.
        Besides, I've been following you.
        Li Hao, you probably haven't experienced the taste of a city-destroying bomb.
        Why did a Martial Master who acted alone, even a top-tier expert, rarely dare to provoke a major power?
        This was the foundation!
        He retreated a little. At this moment, three cannonballs fell from the sky. Li Hao's scalp went numb. He quickly activated his wind-chasing boots and shuttled back and forth. However, the cannonballs were too fast!
        Not only that, the three cannonballs were shot in three different directions, as if they were hit precisely, only avoiding Duke dingguo behind.
        If he wanted to escape, he could only retreat!
        Li Hao instantly understood that the dingguo Army had launched an attack, and the location had been provided by the Duke.
        "Break!"
         Li Hao let out a low growl. His blood and Qi surged, and his divine intent erupted. In an instant, he once again traversed several thousand meters. But the next moment, in the air, that Cannonball exploded like an Energy Ring!  There was no sound, only a powerful energy that swept in all directions.
        All the trees, rocks, and mountains were turned into dust by the Cannonball.
        Behind him, Duke dingguo retreated again and again, and said softly,"Do you think that the dynasty is still standing because of the superpowers and martial masters? Do you think that the reason why no one dares to rebel is because they are afraid of being the first to stand out?"
        None of them!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was only because there had yet to be anyone who could resist a city-destroying bomb and not die.
        Even now, there were many experts!
        But according to the judgment of the Duke of dingguo, no one could withstand the city-destroying bomb unless they had reached the sixth stage of super power and the level of Martial Master. However, the city-destroying bomb also had its drawbacks.
        It was an indiscriminate attack!
        It was difficult to lock onto the enemy.
        This time, it was because he was constantly providing the location.
        If he were to deal with someone stronger than him ... It would be useless.
        However, no matter how many disadvantages there were, the city-destroying bomb was still effective. At this moment, the three cannonballs instantly exploded with light, illuminating the world.
        Silence!
        However, in the next moment, a huge wave swept over, and the world rumbled!
        Even if Duke dingguo was very far away, at this moment, he was shaken to the point where he staggered slightly. He felt as if his ears were going deaf, and the world had lost its sound. He closed his eyes, and the dazzling light seemed to want to blind him.
        Li Hao was probably even more uncomfortable!
        As for killing Li Hao, Xu Qing felt that it would be very difficult. With the Windchaser boots, that guy should be able to escape from the core of the explosion if he kept running. However, he would definitely be injured!
        He had determined that even if Li Hao tried to escape, he wouldn't be able to escape the explosion so easily.
        This city-destroying bomb was indeed a great killing weapon against the foreign races during the ancient civilization.
        BOOM!
        The huge explosion, after flattening everything in front of it, spread out. In all directions, the ground was cracking, spreading out, and huge cracks appeared.
         In the distance, someone saw this scene and quickly recorded it down with a look of shock.
        "Duke dingguo is chasing after the demonic sword and has used three city-destroying bombs ... The demonic sword ... Is within the explosion's range!"
        ……
        At this moment, Li Hao felt like he was floating.
        He had never seen a city-destroying bomb before, nor had he experienced its power.
        Silver Moon had threatened him a few times, but he had never dared to use it. It was said that the central continent had used it, but Li Hao had never seen it.
        This time, he had experienced it.
        Three!
        After sealing off three directions, he kept running forward. At the moment of the explosion, he managed to escape the core area of the explosion. However, even so, the spreading shockwaves still hit him so hard that he felt like dying!
        Silver armor appeared, and even cracks appeared on the armor.
       
        The Black Panther on his back instantly abandoned Li Hao and transformed into a big golden dog. With a scream, the Golden fur on its back was instantly obliterated.
        In the blink of an eye, he had become a bald dog!
        Li Hao's internal organs were also struck by the powerful energy. If his five internal organs weren't strong enough, he might have died from the impact.
        Although he wasn't dead, Li Hao was bleeding from all his orifices!
        The cracks on the silver armor were slowly healing, but this meant that the powerful impact had exceeded the silver armor's endurance.
        A large mouthful of blood spurted out.
        Li Hao grabbed the bald dog and looked back. At this moment, Xu Qing was constantly retreating. He was almost ten thousand meters away from Li Hao!
        In the distance, Xu Qing opened his eyes and saw Li Hao flying away again. Xu Qing's expression was cold."You can't escape! Li Hao, this is just a warning! I've been tracking you, and your position has always been exposed. There are only three of them this time ... Do you want to take on 10, or even 30, all-encompassing attacks?"
        In front of him, Li Hao fled without looking back!
        30?
         Yes, at that time, he might not be able to escape, but would Xu Qing dare to?
        He couldn't bear that much.
        Moreover, Li Hao didn't believe that this thing could be fired without limit!
        The first time, he wasn't prepared. He sensed some danger in advance and didn't realize the source of the danger. Now that he sensed it, he saw it. He saw that the city-destroying bomb actually had energy fluctuations the moment it tore through the air.
        This city-destroying bomb was a huge mass of energy.
        This thing might be an energy bomb.
        It was similar to the thing fan Chang had thrown down that day, but it was even more powerful. However, it should be more difficult to launch it.
        Behind him, Xu Qing frowned.
        This Li Hao was really good at running.
        He was obviously injured. Cracks and black soot appeared on his silver armor, and the big dog, a descendant of an ancient demon, was seriously injured by the impact. But Li Hao still didn't give up.
        "Li Hao, if you keep running, you won't be able to survive. Cooperate with me ..."
        "Cooperation my ass!"
        Li Hao roared and soared into the sky."Continue chasing! You're going to a place with many people, if you have the guts, then blow it up, it's not my territory!"
        BOOM!
        Li Hao dragged the screaming Black Panther and quickly disappeared.
        Xu Qing's face was cold as he controlled the dingguo Army through the communication Jade again.
        Li Hao's expression changed again. In an instant, he went crazy and poured all his internal strength into the wind chasing boots. The Cannonball fell from the sky again!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
        A moment later, a huge energy wave flattened a small mountain in front of him, and Li Hao's figure disappeared again.
        ……
        "Very close ..."  "Pfft!"
        Li Hao spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes cold and sharp. There must be a dingguo army camp nearby. Otherwise, the city-destroying bomb would not have come so quickly!  It was too fast!
        It would take time to launch.
        It was impossible for him to arrive as he said.
        He looked up at the sky, and the next moment, he flew into the air again.
        In less than a minute, Li Hao saw a military camp!
        The moment Li Hao appeared, BOOM!
        Countless physical cannonballs were fired, and countless machine guns were fired from below. In the blink of an eye, several three suns experts and even a Dawnlight flew out of the military camp with a serious expression.
        Demonic sword!
        It was indeed difficult to deal with!
        As for Li Hao, he roared and slashed out with his sword. Countless soldiers were instantly killed by the sword Qi, and many of the supers were killed in the blink of an eye.
        Li Hao sensed the air-piercing sound of Duke dingguo behind him. He quickly drew his sword and killed hundreds of people in the blink of an eye. Finally, he slashed at the center of the camp with all his strength!
        BOOM!
        With a loud bang, the building exploded, revealing a huge launcher. At that moment, sword Qi swept across and cut it in half with a bang!
        Li Hao couldn't be bothered to kill anymore and quickly left!
        The Duke dingguo came.
        At this moment, Xu Qing's face was a little gloomy. This was the disadvantage of the city-destroying bomb. In order to kill the enemy quickly and lock on to the enemy, the distance would not be too far, but it would be easy for the experts to follow the direction of the bomb and directly kill the person who launched it, destroying the firing device.
        The camp was a little chaotic. Some injured soldiers saw the Duke of dingguo and bowed.
        "State Duke, please forgive me!"
         Xu Qing didn't say anything and only threw out a sentence,""Repair the transmitter!"
        Then, he chased after Li Hao again.
        Li Hao had been hit twice by the city-destroying bombs. Although he wasn't at the center, he could feel the pain. Black Panther was more seriously injured. He was wailing and couldn't speak. Otherwise, he would probably be cursing.
        ……
        "This can't go on ..."
        Li Hao vomited blood. If this went on, he might be targeted and attacked again once he approached the next military camp. If this happened a few more times, even if Xu Qing couldn't kill him, he would be shocked to death!
        "I have to enter the sea ..."
        Li Hao vomited another mouthful of blood. Previously, he had been worried that the two generals had gone to the seaside to ambush him, so he hadn't gone there and had wanted to change his direction. But now ... He had no choice but to go!
        The land was even more dangerous!
        If this went on, it would be impossible for him to escape if this happened a few more times. This was Duke dingguo's territory. Only now did Li Hao understand why these major forces couldn't be dealt with easily.
       
        Not only were there many powerhouses, but even a group of ordinary people could cause fatal damage to you.
        ……
        And at this moment, Silver Moon.
        Director Zhao took a look at the news and his face darkened. He said in a low voice,""Xu Qing used a city-destroying bomb. Although it's not in a City area, using a city-destroying bomb ... This is something that was previously forbidden by all parties!"
        Hegemony, killing, war ...
        This was normal.
        However, those in power also knew that once all parties used the city-destroying bombs randomly, it was easy to cause a counterattack. One city-destroying bomb naturally could not destroy a city, but even if a large city like white moon City shot 20 or 30, even if the entire city was not completely destroyed, the ordinary people would probably all die!
        Therefore, all parties had a tacit understanding since a long time ago.
        Other than dealing with the three major organizations, they were not allowed to use the city-destroying bomb at any time.
        As such, Silver Moon had one as well, but it was only enough to threaten the three large organizations. Furthermore, it was just a threat, and he had not actually made a move.
         Huang Yu slammed the table!
        His expression was slightly ugly as he said with a serious tone,""It looks like Xu Qing couldn't catch up to Li Hao. This guy actually ignored the agreement and launched a city-destroying bomb ... Damn it!"
        Director Zhao was also silent for a while.
        After a moment, he looked into the distance and suddenly said,""Take the Silver Moon Army, bring three launchers, and 30 city-destroying bombs to the North Sea! If the various parties don't punish the dingguo Army ... Then, we'll start a war of city-destroying bombs!"
        Huang Yu didn't say anything and disappeared from where he was.
        At the side, Kong Jie snorted."If you ask me, I'd say we should just go to Linjiang!"
        "You want to exterminate all the commoners in Linjiang?"
        Director Zhao looked at Kong Jie. She didn't say anything else. It was fine for the North Sea as they were all Pirates. They just had to avoid the merchant ships. However, if they went to Linjiang ... There would be countless casualties.
        "This Xu Qing is already fearless in order to kill Li Hao ..." Kong Jie said angrily."He won't care too much even if we intimidate him. The East is his territory, after all. Intimidating him from a distance won't work!"
        Huang Yu's actions might be effective, but it was more likely that Xu Qing would be attacked by all parties after the incident.
        At the moment, neither the nine divisions nor the royal family would care too much.
        Do you expect them to send troops to flatten the East now?
        What a fool's dream!
        Silver moon's actions would only make the various parties restrict the usage of the city-destroying bombs, but would not completely put an end to it.
        When someone could withstand the attack of the city-destroying bomb, the bomb would no longer be the balance between the parties.
        Director Zhao didn't say anything, he just asked,""The light sword and the earth overturning sword have set off?"
        "They should be leaving. I can't follow them."
         Director Zhao nodded his head, but it was too far.  Going to the East was not something that could be done in a short time. At this moment, Li Hao could only save himself.
        Kong Jie also sighed.
        In his opinion, Li Hao was still too rash this time. Li Hao probably didn't expect Xu Qing to use the city-destroying bomb. With a strong fighter following you and locking onto your position, it would be difficult for you to escape.
        "After all, Li Hao is the Vice-commander of the Silver Moon Nightwalker. The inspection Division should send a message to stellarsky city to condemn Xu Qing and have them step in to stop the fight between the two parties ..."
        Kong Jie rolled her eyes!
        Was there something wrong with old Zhao?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Was that even possible?
        "If I tell you to go, then go!"
        Director Zhao frowned,"at least do it for the greater good so that it'll be more convenient for us to do things later. Otherwise, it's not appropriate to do anything!" As for The Grudge between Li Hao and the Xu family, don't say a word or admit it. If you have evidence, go to the night patrolman. The Xu family doesn't have the power to enforce the law, and Xu Qing isn't a night patrolman or an inspector!"
        "Right, don't forget to mention that Li Hao was sent by Silver Moon to annihilate the red beard Pirates ... As for Xu Xing and the others" deaths, did anyone see that Li Hao had anything to do with it? Everyone only saw him killing red beard. Xu Qing kept chasing after Li Hao. Could it be to avenge the Pirates?"
        Kong Jie thought,'you want to force Xu Qing to stop using righteousness? For the sake of power, he still cares about his reputation. "
        "No chance!"
        Director Zhao shook his head."Xu Qing won't give up so easily. I'm just making him not dare to use the dingguo Army again!"
        Then, he waved his hand and said,"go. Hurry up and spread the news. Don't forget to apply for a reward for Li Hao. He killed a Pirate from the East China Sea. Don't the higher-ups reward him?" Li Hao likes to be promoted ... I'll promote him! Now that hou Xiaochen is gone, the night patrolmen are lacking a patroller ... Apply for Li Hao!"
        "This ... Alright!"
        Kong Jie wasn't sure what Zhao wanted to do, but it was better than doing nothing.
         Very quickly, Kong Jie also left.
        After he left, director Zhao hesitated for a moment before picking up the red communicator on the table. He dialed a number and said,"Use the Silver Moon hidden guards in Dingbian and the three nearby provinces to receive Li Hao and stop Xu Qing. Buy Li Hao some time ..."
        "My Lord ..."
        "Go do it!"
        "Yes!"
        Soon, the communication was cut off.
        Director Zhao looked towards the east and frowned. The distance was still too far. The teleportation arrays from the ancient civilization had long been lost. Otherwise, they could still teleport over.
        It would have been fine if they were near the Silver Moon, but in the East, even the Silver Moon would not have much power to use.
        If Li Hao was nearby, he could go and help Kong Jie and Huang Yu, but they were so far away that it was not convenient for them to go.
        "East ... East ..." He cried.
       
        "Yu Chuo, the Marquis of East Pole, divine sun Union ..."
        After thinking for a while, he picked up the communicator again and dialed a number. This red communicator was the most confidential communication system in the entire dynasty. It was the most human and material-intensive communication system.
        It was even more advanced than a communication Jade, but only some top-tier officials were qualified to have one.
        Also, it was very likely that Wang Chao would monitor them. However, director Zhao didn't care about that at this moment. The communication system on the communication Jade was all small circles and small systems. He couldn't quickly contact other people.
        A moment later, the communication was connected.
        From the other side, a suspicious laugh was heard."Director Zhao? What kind of wind made director Zhao remember to call me today ... It's my honor!"
        "Marquis of East Pole, how about sending troops to threaten the border of East Pole province? At the very least, general heaven and earth will return to the borders ..."
        "Director Zhao, are you joking?"
        On the other side, the noble Lord chuckled."Dynasty is still here, director Zhao, you really know how to joke!"
        "The land of Silver Moon has opened once again ... The Far East Province can hold the token and enter Silver Moon!"
         The Marquis of East Pole was silent for a moment. After a while, he said,""Difficult! Even if the two great generals have returned, I think the demonic sword is in grave danger. You've underestimated Xu Qing and the Xu family! It's a cat and mouse game with Xu Qing, and Li Hao can't escape the Xu family's net!"
        "Just do what you need to do."
        "Alright! However ... This is the dynasty's communication system ..."
        "Yes."
        Director Zhao laughed,"do you think the dynasty will monitor us?" "Our conversation is top secret. If the dynasty eavesdroppers ... That means that the dynasty no longer trusts us. Aren't we afraid of the opposition of everyone in the 99 provinces? So, the news won't be leaked. Once it's leaked ... It must be something wrong with dynasty. Even we are monitoring it. What do you think?"
        "Hahaha! That's reasonable, reasonable!"
        The Marquis of East Pole laughed."How about this? I'll make the arrangements. But if Xu Qing thinks that Li Hao is more important than the border, then I can't do anything about it.“
        "Just do it,"
        "Alright, director Zhao, don't forget what I said before."
        "Silvermoon people aren't like this."
        "Yes, I believe that!"
        The call ended.
        As for whether or not the dynasty was eavesdropping, the two of them did not really care. So what if they heard it?
         Perhaps, dynasty could not wait to see such a scene!  Director Zhao let out a sigh of relief. As for the rest ... Li Hao could do as he pleased.
        ……
        At this moment, Xu Qing, who was chasing after Li Hao, suddenly frowned and glanced at his communication Jade with a livid face.
        "Three minutes ago, the Marquis of the East Pole announced that some of the rebel soldiers held the soldiers of the dingguo Army hostage and forcefully fired a city-destroying bomb, causing unrest in the East. The East Pole Army will immediately send troops to suppress the rebellion. I hope that the high Duke's public house will open the door of convenience and suppress the rebellion together ..."
        "Bastard!"
        Xu Qing was extremely furious. How dare he!
        The Marquis of East Pole was actually sending troops!
        Of course, the other party might just be intimidating and scaring people, but ... At this moment, six of the eight generals were dead, and the two deputy marshals, which were his two sons, were also dead. He was not in the Army.
        Although they could be remotely controlled, once the Far East Army really did come ... They would definitely be defeated.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He gritted his teeth and took out his communication Jade to send a message to the two generals.
        Regardless of whether the other party was a threat or not, at this moment, there had to be an expert back to hold the fort.
        Only by returning would the two generals be able to calm down the nation's Army and prevent the Marquis of East Pole from acting rashly.
         "Silver Moon, what a good name!"
        He snorted coldly. It went without saying that someone on Silvermoon's side must have bribed the Marquis of East Pole.
        Otherwise, how could that fellow have so easily declared his position!
        Dealing with these matters still took up some of his time. Xu Qing coldly snorted once more and soared into the sky to continue his pursuit of Li Hao. It did not matter if they lost two people, as this matter would only make people more fearful of Silver Moon. Just you wait, Silver Moon and those bastards!
        ……
        At this moment, in the North Sea.
        The two figures flashed by, and their auras caused the surrounding experts, Pirates, and merchant ships to all move out of the way in fear.
        Hong Yitang's face was bitter.
        'F * ck, here we go again. How many days has it been?'
        They had just saved the light sword last time, and it was Li Hao's turn this time. Can't you guys just take a break for a few days?
       
        The eastern sea was near the border of the central region.
        Yuan Shuo held his communication Jade and grinned."Ruthless!"
        He even used the city-destroying bomb.
        And there was more than one.
        The Xu family was ruthless enough, and so was Xu Qing.
        Of course, since they were mortal enemies and Li Hao had come to kill them, it was not wrong for them to use the city-destroying bomb. Yuan Shuo was not angry about this, but the city-destroying bomb did not hurt the experts that much. The ones who were truly intimidated were the ordinary people.
        The use of a city-destroying bomb ... Was actually not in line with the rules, whether it was for the government or the martial arts world.
        Things like rules ... If they didn't care, then there was nothing they could do.
        Yuan Shuo laughed. At this moment, he did not know whether to laugh or to be angry.
        He looked at the ocean in front of him and realized that he was facing the eastern continent.
         There was a bridge in front of them.
        East China Sea bridge.
        It was built by the eastern continent and ran through the Central and Eastern regions. It was considered the narrowest place in the eastern sea and had a total length of more than 300 miles. If it was not the era of supers, it would be almost impossible to complete this task.
        However, in this era, superpowers were miracles that could be created.
        Of course, Yuan Shuo was also not surprised.
        What was this?
        It was recorded in ancient books that in the ancient civilization era, they had even built a wall that was up to 1000 meters high and surrounded an area of the world to seal off the entire catacombs.
        "Little brat ... You really know how to cause trouble. Why did you have to come to other people's territory and cause trouble?"
        Yuan Shuo muttered, and a short knife appeared in his hand. The stone knife was now a bit crystal clear, it was the stone knife of the eight great families.
        Yuan Shuo didn't think that weapons were his Forte.
        However, that didn't mean that he didn't know how to use weapons. On the contrary, he was much stronger than ordinary martial masters with weapons. He was just not as strong as those top experts who specialized in one Dao.
        However, the stone saber was also indestructible, so it was quite useful.
        He crossed the bridge in one step.
        On both sides of the bridge, there were troops stationed. In the middle, there were troops stationed in the nearby province, and on the opposite side, there were the dingguo Army.
        This bridge was not something anyone could cross.
        When Yuan Shuo walked over, an expert quickly flew over and shouted,""You can't cross this bridge. If you want to go to the East, take the water route!"
        The bridge was built, but they didn't allow anyone to cross it.
        Yuan Shuo, who looked gentle and refined, glanced at the general and smiled.""It is said that Xu Qing built this bridge of the East Sea to connect the Central and Eastern regions because this dongbin province has joined the Xu family. Is that true?"
        The general's expression changed slightly as he shouted,""Who are you?"
        As for whether it was true or not ... Of course, it was true.
        If it was fake, Xu Qing must have gone crazy to invest so much and pay such a huge price to build this giant bridge. Wouldn't it make it easier for the central continent to invade?  On the contrary, Xu Qing was extremely ambitious.
        He built this Donghai Bridge so that he could enter the central region.
        On the other side of the bridge, it naturally could not be an enemy, but only one of his own or a friend. The actual ruler of dongbin province was actually the descendant of a general under the command of the Xu family's dingguo Army.
        He had followed the first generation of Duke dingguo.
        In the past, Yuan Shuo didn't care about these matters and they had nothing to do with him.
        But at this moment, he was smiling brightly. "I'm going to cross this bridge today. Move aside. You don't know me, so you probably don't have a high status. I'll go across and cause trouble for the Xu family. Move aside and I won't kill you. Don't force me to be ruthless!"
        The general's expression changed slightly.
        Those who dared to and could say such things ... Were not ordinary!
        He was somewhat apprehensive, but the eastsea bridge was an extremely important strategic bridge. The key was that there was a problem in the middle of the bridge ... It wasn't that the bridge was broken, but that a large number of Pirates had gathered in the middle of the bridge. With the eastsea bridge as the boundary, they were rapidly spreading out, ready to encircle and annihilate Li Hao.
        At this moment, no one was allowed to enter the bridge.
        The general quickly sent a message to his surroundings. In an instant, there was some movement in the camp in the distance as a large number of superpowers appeared.
        Yuan Shuo raised his eyebrows."We're separated by the East China Sea. Are you guys going to risk your lives for the Xu family?"
        "I don't understand what you're talking about!"
        "Leave now!" The man shouted."This is an important place on the eastern coast, and we are carrying out military affairs at the moment ... No one is allowed to pass through!"
        "Military affairs?"
        Yuan Shuo chuckled and did not delay any further. In an instant, as if he had teleported, he disappeared from where he was.
        When he reappeared, he had a communication Jade in his hand.
        The general's vision blurred, and he saw that the person had disappeared. When he reappeared, the other party was flipping through something. He realized that something was wrong, and his expression changed. He immediately shouted,""Kill the bandits!"
        BOOM!
        There were sounds of guns and superpower explosions. Someone attacked instantly.
         However, Yuan Shuo didn't care about that. He disappeared again in a flash. After checking his communication Jade, he sighed."This kid is in big trouble. The eastern coast has been sealed off by the Army ..."
        The message on the communication Jade was simple.
        Seal the Donghai Bridge, seal off the nearby three hundred miles of the sea, and cooperate with the Pirates of the Donghai. Once they find the traces of the demonic sword, do not stop it, but quickly report it.
        Obviously, they had also received a message from the Xu family.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Pirates of dongbin province, in cooperation with the East Ocean, had sealed off this part of the sea. The border was on the other side. No matter how fast Li Hao was, it was difficult for him to escape the entire border. If he wanted to cross the sea, he could only do so within this range.
        After reading this, Yuan Shuo fell silent.
        He instantly disappeared, and the stone blade flickered.
        Puchi!
        The head fell to the ground!
        Under the shocked gazes of the people around him, Yuan Shuo flickered like an agile monkey. He did not say anything harsh, nor did he make any bold statements. The stone blade flickered continuously, and in the blink of an eye, the entire area near the bridge ... Was completely devoid of any living people!
       
        Yuan Shuo's expression did not change even after he had killed everyone.
        Soon, they entered the military camp and dragged something out with great effort.
        "Hehe, energy cannon. Not bad. They even have a city-destroying bomb ... It seems like they won't stop until Li Hao is dead ..."
        He dragged out a transmitter. It was huge and seemed very familiar.
        After fiddling with it for a while, he looked at the other side of the East Sea and sighed."Damn it, I don't know where you're fighting ... Make some noise. Little Rascals, if you're smart, run here ... If not, you can at least attract some people over."
        After saying that, he spat on his palm and let out a low groan. From the large box at the side, he pulled out a huge Cannonball that was as clear as crystal.
        Such a thing was highly classified.
        The person who had just taken charge of this place was also a rising light. Rising light was completely qualified to safeguard these things. After all, for an ordinary province, even an early rising light expert was a rare expert.
        However, to Yuan Shuo, it was obviously not enough.
        He didn't even feel anything when he killed an early stage rising light realm cultivator.
         Lifting the huge Cannonball, he could feel the violent energy inside. This thing was almost all excavated. It was almost always found in the more powerful ancient ruins. It was a city defense item.
        As for whether or not heaven battling city had any ... Yuan Shuo didn't enter, but instead just wandered around the periphery. However, he determined that there was a 99% chance that there were some, and quite a few.
        At this moment, he didn't care about this.
        He quickly loaded the bullets!
        After acting once, he continued acting.
        The eastern coast side had also put in a lot of effort. This team had brought a total of six city-destroying bombs.
        He directly loaded all six into the launcher.
        Then, he picked up a small box at the side with great familiarity. To launch this thing, a password had to be entered, but it could be cracked.
        The people who used it now had also cracked it.
        As he cracked the code, he sighed."It's all my fault. What did I do to you? if I had known, I wouldn't have disclosed the decryption method thirty years ago. I wanted to balance each other and bring peace to the world so that we martial masters could have a good fight ... But now, you're going against my disciple."
        If word of this got out, it would probably shock many people.
        Not everyone knew that the city-destroying bomb had actually appeared long ago, but it could not be used for long. It was only 30 years ago that the four forces knew how to crack the code to launch it.
        Some people had used it before ... But it had to be used in a self-destructive way. Simply put, some martial masters or a large number of soldiers had to run over and detonate the bomb when they wanted to blow up a place.
        The transmitter couldn't be used.
        Until 30 years ago, Yuan Shuo, who had been digging graves for many years, saw that they were too pitiful. Every time the bomb was detonated, it would lead to the death of a large number of soldiers. So, he waved his hand and spread the secret method.
        Yuan Shuo, who was cursing, quickly loaded the city-destroying bombs.
        Then, he cracked the password and looked at the sights carefully. He looked at the other side ... It was too far away. He couldn't see clearly and couldn't see it.
        It was nothing.
         He didn't care.  The next moment, he pressed the launch button.
        In an instant, six cannonballs were shot out at an extremely fast speed.
        After firing for about five minutes ... Suddenly, BOOM!
        A deafening sound reverberated through the world!
        In the sea, huge waves suddenly appeared, and the bridge suddenly shook violently.
        At this moment, in the middle of the bridge, where Yuan Shuo couldn't see, countless ships were instantly destroyed. Countless pirates were directly turned into nothingness. The incomparably strong bridge quickly collapsed.
        At first, it was a mile, then it quickly spread, two miles, three miles ...
        It spread for dozens of miles. The entire eastsea bridge, a strategic bridge, was destroyed in an instant. Nearly a quarter of its length was destroyed, and other places were still collapsing!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Anguished wails could be heard instantly. Some of the Pirates who were lucky enough to escape started to moan madly.
        In that instant, a large number of Pirates were directly blown to death.
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, had seen the message on his communication Jade. He knew that there were Pirates there, but he didn't know their exact location. His goal was only to destroy the bridge, but he didn't expect that he would kill countless pirates along the way.
        In the sky, among the pirate leaders, some were heavily injured and dying, while some were lucky enough to escape.
        Some people were dumbfounded!
        Someone screamed,"the eastern coast ... The eastern coast used the city-destroying bomb ... The eastern coast deliberately set us up ... The war is about to break out. The city-destroying bomb can be thrown at will ..."
        The world was going to be in chaos!
        At this moment, everyone had the same feeling.
        As he spoke, a huge wave swept across the world. Rumble ... One by one, the Pirates who were still escaping were directly hit by the huge wave that was hundreds or even thousands of meters tall, instantly turning into meat paste!
         At this moment, the East Ocean was no longer peaceful.
        The few remaining pirate leaders quickly spread the news.
        The eastern coast had launched a city-destroying bomb!
        Perhaps someone from the central region had come, and the sky was about to fall.
        ……
        After a while.
        The entire world seemed to be moved again.
        In the stellarsky city.
        "Damn it!" An expert shouted angrily. What do you all want to do? Was the war that would sweep the dynasty open now? What was Dong Bin doing? Xu Qing launched the city-destroying bomb, and the East Coast also launched it ... Are they crazy?"
        As soon as he finished cursing, a trembling voice sounded again with fear,""Secretary, it's not good. In the North Sea, Huang Yu led the Silver Moon Army and threw a total of 30 city-destroying bombs directly at the territory of the sea demon Pirates, white shark Pirates and a few other Pirates! The North Sea is in chaos, and there's a tsunami ... Huang Yu is informing everyone to evacuate from the coast. A tsunami is about to erupt ..."
       
        The Secretary suddenly fell silent.
        He sat down numbly, and after a long time, he exhaled."Notify everyone! Duke of dingguo, Xu Qing, has publicly launched a city-destroying bomb, seriously violating the laws of the dynasty. His position as Duke of dingguo has been demoted by one grade, and he is now the Marquis of dingguo!"
        "Get the royal family to stamp it ... And pass it down! In addition, send people to search Duke dingguo's mansion in Heavenly Star City ..."
        As they were talking, someone came with a trembling voice."Secretary, this is bad. The Heavenly Star Governor, hou Xiaochen, has led the Wei Wu Army to suppress the Duke dingguo's mansion. It's said that there are experts from the three great organizations hiding in the mansion. The Duke dingguo's brother, Xu Yao, was killed on the spot by him, and the Redmoon ghost mask was found on Xu Yao's body ... Hou Xiaochen is currently suppressing and killing the Duke dingguo's second son's eldest daughter, the genius suguang girl ... She has been captured by hou Xiaochen from the Heavenly Star Academy. At this moment ... She's already been locked up in the night patrol prison!"
        "Bastard!"
        The Secretary was furious again. He smashed the table in front of him and shouted,""Who gave him the right?"
        "He ... He said ... He's the governor of heavenstar, so he has the power. Anyone who dares to stop him is a rebel, a dark power of the three major organizations ..."
        "Governor heavenstar ..."
        The man was stunned. After a long while, he was silent.
        He recalled that just a few days ago ... He had agreed to this appointment.
         Yes, this was the inspection Office.
        It was the second law enforcement agency other than the military law Department. When the night patrollers were established, they were actually the first law enforcement agency. Even though the night patrollers were now in a state of disbandment, they were still under the supervision of the inspection department.
        The man was silent for a moment, then he laughed. Suddenly, he sneered,""Good! They were all very good! Silver moon's group was not to be trifled with ... Forget it, let's just ignore them and beat them up! Xu Qing wants to kill Li Hao, so hou Xiaochen will first cut off his bloodline in Heavenly Star ... I'd like to see how long these lunatics can keep up the ruckus!"
        "Dong Bin wouldn't attack the Xu family for no reason ... That city-destroying bomb ... Couldn't have been launched by Dong Bin."
        At this moment, he had calmed down."There's a 99% chance that Silver moon's men are behind this. If it's not Silver moon's plan, then it must be ... Yuan Shuo!"
        The surrounding people were stunned. Yuan Shuo?
        p The Secretary didn't say anything. Who else could do this, dare to do this, and strike with such precision other than Yuan Shuo, the all-rounded genius?  When he was playing with a city-destroying bomb, everyone could only hope that he could blow up a city!
        After a moment of silence, he laughed coldly and said,"ignore them!" As long as it doesn't affect the others ... I'd like to see how strong the Xu family, which has been rooted for two hundred years, is. Can they fight against these Silvermoon lunatics?"
        "Secretary, then ... Should we just let hou Xiaochen show off his power?"
        Some people were a little apprehensive. This guy had gone crazy.
        This was stellarsky city!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the end, that guy directly mobilized his troops in the stellarsky city and even directly arrested people from the stellarsky Academy. This stellarsky Academy had a large number of experts overseeing it. It was the place where the children of countless high officials in the entire dynasty studied.
        That was the true Academy for the elite.
        "There are so many powerhouses in the Academy, didn't anyone stop them?" the inspector said indifferently.  "Yes, Deputy Dean Wang has made a move ..."
        "And then?"
        "And then ... Hou Xiaochen cut off his arm with a single spear strike, and then arrested him. He said he was going to be put on trial, and if his identity as a member of one of the three great organizations was confirmed, he would be executed!"
        The inspector furrowed his brows slightly."A peak stage sunrise expert's arm was also broken by a single spear strike?"
        Hou Xiaochen seemed to be even stronger than before.
        "Yes!"
        "Then I don't care."
        He suddenly laughed."It's not like there's internal strife. It's just the night patrolman, Governor heavenstar, carrying out his duties as usual! As for the city-destroying bombs from the East Sea, North Sea, and Dingbian, let the military law Department handle them!"
        He spat and sneered,""Everyone, watch the show, continue watching! In my opinion, it won't be long before city-destroying bombs are flying all over the sky in Heavenly Star City!"
        He flicked his sleeves and left."Inform me when Li Hao is dead. Inform me when Xu Qing is dead. Don't disturb me with anything else!"
        "Yes!"
        Everyone watched helplessly as the Secretary left. It seemed like this war between the two sides had made him unhappy. The main reason was that the others didn't want to interfere, so the one who wanted to interfere just flicked his sleeves and left.
        When they thought of hou Xiaochen again ... They were all left speechless.
        "Governor hou ... He's really a ruthless man!"
         Someone muttered with a smile on his face.
        Just watch the show, it's none of our business.
        On the other hand, hou Xiaochen was the Vice-commander of the night patrolmen, and could be considered a part of the inspection Bureau. Seeing this arrogant man beat up and kill people they normally couldn't afford to offend ... To be honest, everyone felt quite good about this!
        ……
        Tenstar Academy.
        It was a new academy that had been established for 20 years. Countless descendants of high-ranking officials gathered here. The children of countless local high-ranking officials and some extremely talented people had all studied here.
        But today, this place was completely silent.
        Hou Xiaochen coughed.
        Holding a list in his hand, he stood on a high platform and coughed,""Xu Ming, Xu Yue, Xu Rong ... Are all of these people here?"
        He swept his gaze across the thousands of angry students and coughed again.""In addition, those whose names are called, please step forward. This time, I'm calling the children of the chief of the four major organizations in Dingbian province ... There seems to be a rebellion in Dingbian. In order to protect you, I'm bringing you back to the night patrol ..."
       
        "Hou Xiaochen, Silvermoon martial forest, please don't implicate your family!" Someone said angrily. You're too much!"
        Hou Xiaochen coughed and laughed,"I'm sorry, but I'm not from the martial arts world!" I'm an official, the star military governor, the Deputy Minister of the night patrol. As an official, I can't follow the rules of bandits. Besides ... I'm protecting them! Moreover, I was the commander of the Wei Wu Army in the past, and my mission was to eliminate the disobedient extraordinary powers in the world ... Actually, according to the previous rules, I should have destroyed this Academy. If you don't believe me, you can ask the king of the plains, was this the original intention of the Wei Wu Army?"
        He coughed again."It's a pity. The Wei Wu Army is not as good as before. The king of the plains also wants to kill the bandits, but he can't do anything about it!! I originally wanted to restore the royal family ... Cough, cough, I'm wrong, don't misunderstand ... But now, the Wei Wu Army is crippled. As the governor of heavenstar, I won't mention this. "
        As he spoke, a white-haired old man walked out from the distance. His face was calm as he walked towards hou Xiaochen and said softly,"Brother hou, if there's anything, you can talk to me in private. There's no need to do this. Besides, even if brother hou captures these people, can it affect the Duke of dingguo?"
        Would the person who didn't even care about his son's death care about these people?
        Whether it was a younger brother, a granddaughter, or a grandnephew ... Did he care?
        In the pugilistic world, one shouldn't involve one's family in a disaster, but hou Xiaochen said that he wasn't from the pugilistic world, and that it was Xu Qing who broke the rules first ... No one could say anything.
        At this moment, the white-haired old man walked out to settle the matter.
        If tengxing Academy were to continue to be in trouble, its reputation would be completely destroyed. Who would believe that this was the number one Academy in the dynasty?
         Hou Xiaochen coughed for a while before panting, "Don't misunderstand, I'm really just wiping out the members of the three major organizations, not taking revenge for a private matter. I'm not that kind of person. Brother Zhao, we haven't seen each other for many years, and you've really misunderstood me ..."
        After he finished speaking, he revealed a smile."How about this? I won't make things difficult for brother Zhao, and I won't argue with these little friends. Brother Zhao, do me a favor, and I will lead the Army out of tenseng Academy."
        "Please speak."
        The old man sighed as he looked at him. Many years ago, the two of them had gotten to know each other. Back then, hou Xiaochen had even come to the central continent and stellarsky city to serve under the king of the plains.
        But now, things had changed.
        Hou Xiaochen chuckled."I've been running low on manpower lately, and tenseng Academy has a bunch of talented students. They're good seedlings. Let them follow me on a few missions. It'll be a graduation exam ... It just so happens that I'm going to eliminate the members of the three major organizations. Let these students contribute to the country!"
        As he spoke, he looked at the angry students and smiled.""No matter how much you learn in the Academy, it's not as good as fighting in real life. Only then will your talent, knowledge, and powerful strength not be in vain!"
        "Let's take Li Hao as an example. He didn't learn anything when he was studying at the silver Blizzard city's ancient Academy, but he's become a top-notch expert after leaving the Academy for only a few days. He also served under me before ... You people still need to experience it. The three great organizations are even more evil, burning, killing, plundering, and doing anything ... I'll take you to see blood, seize the enemy's treasures, kill evil powerhouses, deter the four corners of the world ... Make your name known all over the world, how happy!"
        The moment he said that, the look in some people's eyes changed instantly. They were a little excited, but they held it in and didn't say a word.
        The white-haired old man frowned slightly.
        Hou Xiaochen laughed."It's fine if you don't dare. They're all disciples of big families. Some of them might even be in cahoots with the three major organizations ... I don't want these people either. People say that tenstar Academy has many geniuses, but some people say that they're just a bunch of people who came in through the back door. In reality, they're all just for show. When Xuguang went out, he was chased and beaten by the three suns ..."
        "Moreover, the three major organizations are powerful. It's normal for them to be afraid of revenge, death, and blood ..." This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Governor hou, are you trying to goad us into action?" someone roared. As long as the Dean agrees, we'll go! Who would be afraid of killing members of the three Darksider organizations?"
        The white-haired old man revealed a helpless expression.
        Idiot!
        You know how to goad me, yet you still respond.
        He's clearly trying to goad you into action ... Hou Xiaochen, you're really ruthless!
        They were all descendants of high-ranking officials. If something happened and they died at the hands of the three major organizations, what would they do?
        Would the members of the three major organizations dare to kill him?
        If he didn't dare, then he would just wait for death.
        If he dared, the nine divisions, which had been able to get along peacefully before, would probably not agree to it.
        The key was, was it really just to destroy the three major organizations?
         Would hou Xiaochen take her to do something else?
        There were many people who understood what was going on. Some of the experts from the college said coldly,""Hou Xiaochen, no matter what you say, don't even think about taking anyone away ... Do you think no one can see through your little tricks ..."
        "Little tricks? Wasn't it necessary to eliminate the three major organizations? Or ... Are you in cahoots with the three great organizations?"
        "Men, take this man down and bring him back for interrogation!" Hou Xiaochen coughed.
        "Yes!"
        BOOM!
        With a loud bang, the spear pierced through the sky, and the Golden spear was thrust out, sending the man who had spoken flying. The next spear directly pierced through the man's shoulder and landed on the tip of the spear.
        "A powerhouse from the Academy?"
        Hou Xiaochen chuckled,"both of them are at the early stages of the rising light realm ... Yet he captured them alive with just two strikes. Jin Jin just didn't want to kill them, otherwise, he would have killed them with one strike!" Sigh, this is the so-called Academy education ... Ridiculous!"
       
        The white-haired old man looked at him, and his eyes turned slightly cold.
        Hou Xiaochen only looked at him calmly, but a hint of killing intent could be seen in his eyes. If you dare to move ... I'll kill you!
        Even though white hair was in the transformation stage of the rising sun, at this moment, he gradually calmed down.
        He knew that if they really fought, hou Xiaochen would unseal his battle-power and he would die.
        As for whether or not they would ... Xu Qing wouldn 't, and it was hard to say for sure about Silver Moon madmen like hou Xiaochen. They were all ruthless people who would unseal their seals just like that!
        The Golden Spear's display of power had shocked and excited many of the students.
        Were the powerhouses who fought their way out of the battlefields really that different from the powerhouses of the Academy?
        Only two shots!
        "Governor hou, are there any requirements for strength ... To intern behind you?"
        "It doesn't matter. The weak have their uses, and the strong have their uses!"
         "If you're willing, then come with me right now. I just received news that there's a rebellion in the East Coast. Let's go capture the people from the East Coast office in heavenstar and interrogate them. The East Coast might be planning to rebel against the dynasty ... Annihilate them!"
        As soon as he said that, some students 'faces turned pale. They were obviously from the eastern coast.
        "I'll go!"Someone said excitedly.
        It was very rare to witness a great battle in heavenstar.
        An office of a large province stationed in heavenstar would not lack experts.
        "Then follow me!"
        Hou Xiaochen chuckled as he flew into the air and waved his hand, ordering the Wei Wu Army to retreat. With a swing of his golden spear, he threw the expert on the spearhead to the ground, and someone quickly went up to capture the heavily injured Xu Guang.
        "Brother hou, do you still want to take him away?" the white-haired old man frowned.
        Hou Xiaochen turned his head and narrowed his eyes,"brother Zhao, director Zhao, if you don't take him, then I'll take you. You choose!"
        The white-haired old man clenched his fist. After a moment, he chose to remain silent.
        Hou Xiaochen snickered, then burst out laughing!
        His laughter spread in all directions!
        His laughter was extremely arrogant!
        "Let's go!"
        With a single command, the hundreds of Wei Wu Army soldiers quickly retreated. Some of the students looked at the Dean, who didn't dare to say anything, with disdain in their hearts. Metamorphosing, top-tier expert, Supreme ... Bah!
        He didn't even dare to resist!
        All of a sudden, dozens of students rushed out and ran after him.
        Hou Xiaochen's insolence was just what they liked. They were all second-generation heirs, so who wasn't bold? they used to think that this place was pretty good, but today ... What a trashy place!
        To witness true killing was what they were after.
        The next moment, more students rushed out and ran after him.  The white-haired old man just looked on. Soon, a few more people appeared beside him. Each of them had an angry look on their faces as they transmitted their voices to the old man,""Director, he's too insolent!"
        The white-haired old man looked at hou Xiaochen's back for a long time before slowly saying,"The nine divisions, the imperial family, and the noble families have not stepped forward to stop him ... Could it be that you want to stop him?"
        The crowd fell silent. There were still some who were puzzled and said with some resentment,""Why? He's only just arrived from Silver Moon, yet he's already acting so brazenly. Didn't you say that we only had him come here to deal with him?"
        And now?
        He had actually become the governor of heavenstar, who held great power in his hands!
        Where were the people who had clamored to teach him a lesson?
        Were all Silver moon's men this arrogant?
        Demonic sword Li Hao had killed his way into the Duke of dingguo's territory and killed his son right in front of him. Now, hou Xiaochen was doing the same. That little silver Moon was full of barbarians, and the people who came out of the wilderness were indeed all barbarian!
        "Why?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The old man was silent for a while. After a long time, he shook his head. "There's no reason. It's only because these people dare to unseal the seal, while the others ... Don't dare!"
        It was that simple!
        At this stage, the problem of unsealing and breaking the sixth superpower lock had not been solved yet. No one wanted to fight a higher level battle.
        However, Silver Moon dared.
        Even if hou Xiaochen was unsealed, heavenstar would be able to take care of him. However, if there were Tian Jian, bei Quan, BA Dao, Kong Jie, and Huang Yu ...
        Who would be the one to take the lead?
        There was also the Earthcover sword and the Sword of Light!
        What's more, what hou Xiaochen did was within his authority, and he didn't break any laws. What right do you have to go against him?
        The nine divisions were not of one mind.
        Under such circumstances, the powerful hou Xiaochen could naturally act arrogantly.
         The Silver Moon was showing its extraordinary power.
        "Hmph! The way I see it, this time the demonic sword died in Dingbian, let's see if these people can still be arrogant. If we can kill the demonic sword, then the Xu family will have time to recover and we won't be afraid to kill a few more!"
        The white-haired old man did not say anything.
        The next moment, his eyes changed. With a low shout, he punched out, and golden light overflowed. With a loud bang, the golden light exploded, and a long spear broke through the air, breaking the sky. With a fiery light, it pierced through the man who had just spoken!
        From afar, hou Xiaochen's voice could be heard,"If you don't have the strength, then shut up! Brother Zhao, this person has publicly announced that he will kill the night patrol's deputy head of the Silver Moon branch. You don't have any objections to me killing him, right?"
        "Brother Zhao, please stay away from such a rebellious person next time!"
        The old man was speechless.
        When the sound faded, blood dripped from his hand onto the ground. He looked into the distance with an unsightly and horrified expression.
        Hou Xiaochen ... Must have broken through!
        It was not about his realm, but the number of superpower locks that were saturated. There must be more than when he killed the red-haired elder!
