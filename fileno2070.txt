In her heart ... She actually didn't know how to express her feelings.In his opinion, the old Li Hao was better.At that time, Li Hao wouldn't have been interested in them.At that time, if Li Hao wanted the position of Commander-in-Chief, he would take the initiative to say it. For example, he would say,"I want to be a commander ... Just to be one head higher than you." But Li Hao was not like that now.He wouldn't say!He's forcing you to compromise. If you don't compromise, there will be a thorn in both sides.He did not even kill Wu Peng by himself. Instead, he used the turtle guard!Li Hao had changed.Li Hao, on the other hand, was still smiling as if he didn't know what everyone was thinking. In fact, he knew what everyone was thinking.It was just that ... The past was gone, and there was no return."I originally wanted to use my sincerity, my heart, and everything to influence everyone.I was also thinking that we could both take a step back and negotiate.But ... No.These new martial artists, even heaven battling city, which had been cooperating with them for a long time, actually had some resistance every time they cooperated with each other. In other words, they hoped to take the initiative. Would this work?That day in borderless city, he knew that it would not work!Only when I have the initiative will it work.

I'd rather not cooperate!"If I can't take the initiative, in the end, I might not be the one who gets hurt. It might be the people around me. Teacher and the others have left, so I can't let anything happen to the others.You taught me to do this!"You said that I don't have the tyranny of a human King, and I don't need the tyranny of a human King. I only need you to follow me and that's enough.A moment later, the voices of the old turtle and the others echoed throughout heaven battling city."Reserve guard commander Wu Peng was heavily injured in the past. Today, his life force has collapsed and he is completely dead. The sorrow of the heaven battling Army, the sorrow of heaven battling city ... The Army can not go a day without a leader. 8th Division commander Yang Wei, 9th Division commander Li Daozong, we jointly recommend 11th Division commander Li Hao to temporarily take over the position of guard commander!""The city Lord's mansion, general Huai, and the military have discussed and passed this proposal based on war regulations!""Li Hao, take over the reserve forces of the heaven-battling Army!"The next moment, Li Hao's voice sounded, I'm very afraid, but I'll do my best and live up to your expectations! Bring the heaven-battling Army to a better future!"At this moment, some of the soldiers who had recovered stood in the city.He was a little confused!The commander had fallen?This was a very sorrowful matter. However, so many years had passed, and the commander had yet to recover. Today, he had completely fallen and could not recover ... In fact ... Everyone was prepared for this.This was also the result of their discussion. There was no need to say that the other party had betrayed them at this time. It would only cause the heaven battling Army's emotions to fluctuate. Death would instead stimulate the fighting spirit of the heaven-battling Army.The next moment, in the city, streams of mental energy gathered and a deep voice resounded,""Congratulations to commander li!""To heaven battling city!"The sound shook the surroundings!,m They didn't say much, and they didn't resist. Their belief was that it didn't matter who took over. As long as the heaven battling Army was still here and could fight, it was enough.However, he still had some doubts.Why not the ninth master?But Li Hao, an expert of the new era?At this moment, Li Hao had put on his armor. The orange armor dazzled in all directions.His face was covered as he floated in the air, his voice reverberating,""Li Hao, we'll do our best to revive all our brothers in the defense Force! [Fight with me!] Show the might of new martial arts and silver Moon! Kill the rebels, kill the intruders, kill the Crimson Moon experts, kill all who dare to resist! As the descendant of the Li clan, I have the responsibility and duty to lead you to find the human King and the Paragon. My will to fight the heavens will never be extinguished!""Zhan Tian!""Zhan Tian!""Zhan Tian!"The entire city was cheering. At this moment, the will to battle the heavens seemed to have stimulated everyone. Those soldiers who only had a few lingering thoughts left were even cheering loudly!Li Hao's voice rang out again."From now on, the remnants of the Heavenly Star Army will be incorporated into the reserve forces of the heaven battling Army. They will join the 11th Division. Their Regiment commander, Zhao long, will temporarily take over as the commander of the 11th Division!"Zhao long, the strongest of the silver grade captains of the star Army, had become undying. His strength wasn't weak.The star Army would be incorporated into the Army to make it easier to command. All of them would be in the same Army, and communications would be restored.Now, Li Hao was in charge of the nine base stations, and he could adjust the communication channels at will.This way, the connection was even closer.Not only that, but after they joined the heaven battling Army, Li Hao didn't need to command them as a third party. He would be their direct superior, and it wouldn't be difficult for him to recruit them as the commander of the heaven battling Army.Previously, his status as a division commander was not enough to take in this part of the star Army.In the city, the thousands of soldiers of the Heavenly Star Army were surprised and shocked.However, it wasn't unacceptable for the Heavenly Star Army to join the heaven battling Army. The other side was a large Army, while they were only a small army. Li Hao's position as a commander was comparable to their commander, or even higher."Yes!""Yes!" The regimental commanders immediately acknowledged the order. Sempiternal realm Zhao long even replied loudly,""As you command. The Heavenly Star Army designation ... Is canceled! From today onwards, we are all soldiers of the 11th Division of the heaven battling Army!"Li Hao nodded slightly.On the side, the eighth and Ninth Division commanders had complicated expressions.As soon as Li Hao took office, he expanded the heaven-battling Army. Originally, the 11th Division was there, but there was no one. It was just Li Hao ... No, there was also Hong Yitang. There was also Nanquan, but after Nanquan died, his name disappeared.

2071 Chapter 351
Today, only Li Hao and Hong Yitang were in the 11th Division of heaven battling Army. The others had not been officially certified.Now that they had joined the sky Star Army, the strength of the 11th Division had increased dramatically. Although it was not like the other divisions, which had more than ten thousand soldiers, this batch of soldiers was the elite of the sky Star Army!A thousand men might not be much weaker than a ten thousand man Regiment.At this moment, a magnificent power burst out of Li Hao's body. The power of life, the power of vitality, the power of immortality, the power of saintly way, and the power of origin all spread out in all directions!"There are still a lot of soldiers left with only their lingering spirits. Their armors are broken, and their lingering spirits have dissipated ... Their combat power has also weakened a lot. Li Hao is useless and can't resuscitate everyone for the time being. For now, he can only recover the bodies of some company commanders and captains. When we kill more powerful enemies and seize their flesh, origin, and immortal power, Li Hao will definitely do his best to resuscitate all of our comrades!"At this moment, the silver and bronze Warriors suddenly felt that the empty places under their armors were growing flesh and blood!A large amount of immortal power was integrated into it. Not only that, but there was also a Dao Meridian that was condensed.However, the current Dao Meridian had yet to run through the bright star realm.Li Hao was not in a hurry to let them pass through the bright star sector, as it was still quite difficult for them to do so.But ... For future preparations.This group of people were the combination of the Old and New physical bodies. If needed, they could pass through the bright star sector at any time and transform into the physical bodies of the new era.The powerhouses could feel it.No one spoke.He had nothing to say!Were they supposed to stop Li Hao from reviving everyone?Wouldn't that make him a sinner?At this moment, clanging sounds reverberated through the heavens and earth. One by one, the experts hammered their chests in excitement and shouted,""Unparalleled commander!"A smile flashed across Li Hao's face.He was a soldier ... So he didn't care too much.With enough benefits and the enemy killed, it would be easier to win over others than to make a name for themselves and carry forward the spirit of neo martial arts.As for himself, he was only borrowing flowers to present Buddha.A Saint had just died. The flesh, blood, and power of a Saint were enough to revive many people. At this moment, even if the eighth master was not satisfied, there was nothing he could do. He should have made a choice whether to keep the traitor's corpse or revive these people.If Li Hao used Wu Peng's flesh and blood to resuscitate someone else, perhaps this person might not be satisfied. But now ... The eighth division commander looked on helplessly and with mixed feelings.What could he say?He couldn't say anything. He couldn't even reveal this information to anyone. Otherwise, he would be instigating a conflict between the soldiers and the commander!The eighth division commander glanced at Li Hao and snorted in his heart. This is a bad guy!He was very dissatisfied with this man becoming the commander, but ... It seemed like he could not reject him. At this moment, Li Hao asked again, has the eighth division commander's body recovered yet?"I'm not recovering!"The eighth division commander snorted. Li Hao said softly,""If the eighth division commander is not recovering, does that mean that he is not willing to put in any effort to annihilate the enemy? Forget it, since that's the case ...""You said I'm afraid of battle?""I don't mean it that way. But if you don't recover, your strength will be greatly reduced. You'll only be at the peak of battle strength, around the first layer of sun and moon. I have too many sun and moon under my command ...""You ...""Is it resuscitating?""Revive!"Even the eighth division commander's armor was trembling. He felt that he was unable to resist. At this moment, he only felt that he was stuck in a quagmire and could not extricate himself!As for Li Hao, he revealed a smile and reached out his hand. A pile of flesh and blood appeared."Director Wang's original body just exploded. But don't worry, this is formed from the immortal energy of some monster plants, not that person 's. The 8th Division commander doesn't need to be bothered.""Hmph!""Looking down on your superiors?" Li Hao said indifferently."Should a soldier do this?"The eighth division commander felt extremely aggrieved and shouted,""Yes, sir!"Li Hao nodded slightly."That's more like it. Obedience is a soldier's duty!" As for the other matters, they are all additional matters. The senior officers will handle them well. Eighth division commander, remember this and just follow your orders!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Yes!"No matter how aggrieved the eighth division commander was, he could do nothing to this young Shangguan. He could only reply with a sullen expression.Li Hao nodded."Very good. Go and recover, eighth and Ninth Division commanders!" We've already wasted a lot of time, and we can't waste any more. I hope you can recover your full combat strength as soon as possible!""Also, all the monster plants in heaven battling city, except for general Huai, will be incorporated into the monster botanist! "Excluding the original 13 monster plants and general Huai, there are 22 monster plants, all at the immortal level. All of them joined the monster plant Army, and now there are 48 monster plants, 14 paragons, and 34 immortal beings. For the time being, Suki will be the division commander of the monster plant master, and the Imperial Guard will be the Deputy Division commander ..."Huai Junjun wanted to speak but stopped.Are you going to take away my descendants just like that?You even specially removed me?Was this appropriate?Li Hao continued,"general Huai is a Saint. He has important matters to deal with. He doesn't have the time to deal with these chores. Let Suki and the Imperial Guards do it!" General Huai ... What do you think?"What else could he do?"We'll do as the governor ... Commander says!"General Huai said softly.Li Hao laughed,"general Huai is righteous!" If we win this time, we'll definitely gain a lot, and I'll give priority to resurrecting all of our comrades in the heaven-battling Army!"As soon as he finished speaking, he turned to look at Xiang Fuhai."Sea Protector, you are in charge of the demon beast lineage. However, the demon beast lineage doesn't have many members now ... There are many demon beasts in the Cang mountains, but they are very weak. In addition, in the land of Silver Moon, there are still some demon beasts that occupy the mountains and call themselves Kings. After I solve these matters, I will definitely form a demon beast Army!"

2072 Chapter 351
Li Fuhai didn't mind and said casually,""It's fine as long as the governor has the heart. Everything will be as you wish. "Li Hao nodded."Then ... Work hard on your cultivation and recover to your peak state as soon as possible!"As soon as he finished speaking, storage rings flew out one after another."These are all energy stones and the spring of life ... Seniors, please recover as much as you can. One more point of combat power and one more point of hope!" Everyone did not say much. They each took their storage rings and left quickly.Li Hao, on the other hand, smiled again.But today, he felt comfortable.This huge heaven battling city ... In the blink of an eye, he had occupied a very large dominant position, and although it was not the entire city ... What was the rush?Only his heart wasn't completely black!If he killed the two guardians in this battle, this heaven battling city ... Would be his.Of course, there was no need to do so.Li Hao thought to himself. He didn't seize power only for power. He no longer hoped that these new martial artists would hesitate again and again. Every time these people hesitated, they would bring him huge losses.Since he didn't want to be persuaded by the soft approach and didn't want to be coerced by the hard approach ... Then he would use both the soft and the hard approach!After dealing with these matters, Li Hao also disappeared.He was going to enter the bright star sector and make some arrangements.Li Fuhai had said before that he would turn the bright star sector into a maze. It was actually a good idea and a good method. Now, anyone who entered would be able to see the entire universe. Since that was the case, he would have to spend some more effort to move it.And he might be able to take advantage of this opportunity to successfully open all 36 meridians of his sword Dao.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Just as heaven battling city regained its peace ...In the great wilderness.A few desolate beasts urged the Lord of great desolation to attack the eastern continent and occupy the East.They were also impatient!And outside of the vast wilderness, the Liu family's ancient city that had disappeared was hidden underground.Most of the ancient cities were silent and could not be activated.The Liu family's Hurricane city, on the other hand, had silently teleported nearby.In the city.Hong Chen sat in the city Lord's mansion, resting his chin on his hand as he fell into deep thought.The great wilderness ...The plan to resurrect by killing people had been destroyed by Li Hao. For the plan to resurrect the forbidden Sea, Ying Hongyue had done something that had caused the forbidden Sea to stop moving.Now, only by subverting the great wilderness would he have a chance to stabilize the world once more.And he had thought of this.What about Li Hao?Previously, he had underestimated Li Hao. Without a sound, the other party had actually invaded boundless city, causing his plan to fail. Now, red dust no longer underestimated Li Hao."If he also knows ... Will he appear in the great wilderness?" Many thoughts flashed through his mind.He could not help but laugh. Since when had he ever thought that the people of this era would destroy his plans again and again?He looked up at the sky and sighed.Hong Yue's venerable sovereign had also become a sharp sword on his head.Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone through so much trouble to force his way out.At this moment, just like Li Hao, he felt that he was surrounded by pressure. If he walked out, the seal would loosen and the red moon Emperor would break out.If they didn't go out, they wouldn't be able to do anything to Li Hao's side.As for Li Hao, he had been trying to suppress the arrival of the second recovery, which was not in his interest."Li Hao thinks that I will overturn the great wilderness ... The great wilderness King might think the same ..."Previously, he had projected a weak clone to look for the other party, but the other party had not agreed. This was also within his expectations."Li Hao ... The great desolate King ..."Many thoughts appeared in red dust's mind. Suddenly, he revealed a smile."Then ... What if the great wilderness spreads?"If he wanted to go out, he did not necessarily need the world to recover and the chaos to spread. He might be able to walk freely in the chaotic region, isolated from the world. However, the chaos would erode the will of heaven, which might also cause the seal to loosen.However, as long as it was within his control, he might be able to walk out again."And, is the Zhenxing city on the eastern continent ... Related to me?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The thought reappeared in his mind. Unfortunately, he didn't see any members of the Xu family last time. He didn't find the ruins of star suppression city, and he didn't know where the Xu family had gone."Saturn city ... This name might be related to me."If the great wilderness spread to the East, he might be able to take a look.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Li Dynasty.Ying Hongyue shook her head and sighed. She furrowed her brows."This Qian Wuliang was just a nobody before. I didn't expect that he would be so difficult to deal with!"Beside him, the flying sword immortal didn't have the imposing immortal Qi it had before.At this moment, he was in a sorry state.Her long hair fell and was a little messy. She was a little resentful. "It's very difficult to deal with! In the past few days, a large number of members had died in his hands, bastard! What should he do now? The other party has joined forces with the king of Dali, and there are many experts in the Army. We have lost a lot of men several times. How can this Qian Wuliang discover our tracks again and again?"The three great organizations had always been mysterious.However, this time, it was difficult to escape their pursuit every time. The other party was like a hunting dog, locking onto their position time and time again. In addition, their combat strength had reached the middle stage of the sun Moon realm, which was comparable to the immortal realm. Together with King Dali and Jiang Li, almost no one could defeat them except Ying Hongyue from the three great organizations.After a few encounters, she, Yan Luo, and vast sky Mountain Master had all suffered quite a bit.Every time Qian Wuliang saw them, his eyes were filled with disgust, as if he had seen a peerless treasure. He was determined to take their heads!Li Hao had said that Qian Wuliang's mission would only be completed after he took the head of one of the leaders of the three organizations.

2073 Chapter 351
Qian Wuliang knew very well why this task was assigned to him.He knew very well that if he couldn't complete it, it would be very difficult for him to return to Li Hao's core. Last time, Li Hao had seen through his selective rescue. He knew that only by killing a leader could he make up for his mistake!Therefore, in just a few days, the three major organizations in the Li Dynasty had suffered a hundred times more than before!Qian Wuliang didn't sleep or rest as he tracked them down time and time again. Each time, he would eat up some of the organization's members. However, the other party didn't care about the death of their own people. After all, they were all from the Li Dynasty!The Dali King also wanted to drive them away and kill them, but he couldn't do anything even if he was dead. He could only follow Qian Wuliang. Both sides suffered losses, but Qian Wuliang was the only one from heavenstar.Ying Hongyue also took a deep breath and spoke after a moment,"Leave the Li Dynasty ... Leave the Li Dynasty, and the Li King and the others will stop ...""Leaving again?"The Yama's voice was rough and carried a hint of anger,"From the central region, escape to the North, from the North, escape to the Li Dynasty! Now that we're leaving the Li Dynasty again, where are we going? Where else can we go?"The Li Dynasty was already at the extreme north!Further north was the barrier between heaven and earth. That was the limit of heaven and earth, and it was impossible to cross it again.Ying Hongyue was silent for a moment before she said,'to the divine Kingdom! He couldn't go to the vast wilderness. It was too dangerous. Li Hao and the red dust world's side were keeping an eye on the vast wilderness! Now that Shui Yun has joined Li Hao ... His only option is to go to the divine Kingdom!""To the divine Kingdom?"They all frowned."Li Hao killed a large number of experts in the divine Kingdom. It's said that even a Saint-level God was killed. Are we going to the divine Kingdom now ... To cooperate with them?"Ying Hongyue said softly,"that's the only place we can go!" "Gods can be resurrected ... Also, the moon goddess won't die so easily. Moreover, if the moon goddess and I work together, we might be able to help the moon goddess recover some of her battle power ... Her power is sealed in the Silver Moon! Right now, she's in the most difficult situation, and she hates Li Hao. If I help her recover some of her battle prowess and become a saint, perhaps ... We'll be able to welcome a period of peace. "The divine Kingdom was in the far west, while they were in the far north. The thought of having to run away again made them feel uncomfortable.Once upon a time, the three great organizations that dominated the world were like rats, running around every day without stopping.Just as she said this, Ying Hongyue furrowed her brows slightly.The next moment, a chuckle came from outside.""Over here!"BOOM!A pair of fists instantly broke the sky and the earth. The mountain peaks collapsed in an instant, and the figure of Dali King appeared, revealing a cold look."A bunch of rats. They're really hiding here. General Ying really has some tricks up his sleeve!"Qian Wuliang said with a gentle smile,""This time ... I can't let them escape so easily. At the very least, I have to kill a few people other than Ying Hongyue!"After he finished speaking, he looked at Ying Hongyue with a red glow in his eyes. He chuckled softly and said,"Ying Hongyue, the Marquis said that you're difficult to deal with and that you're his greatest enemy. I'd like to see if you'll stay in the Li Dynasty and fight with us this time, or ... Escape to the Western divine Kingdom and look for the moon goddess and the others?"Ying Hongyue frowned slightly.He looked at Qian Wuliang for a long time and said,""How about coming to my place? Li Hao doesn't value you and even wants to kill you with a borrowed knife. Now that you've come to my place, you can order anyone else, and I'll even discuss things with you ... If you and I work together, why do you have to listen to someone else's orders?" "You're ambitious," he said, chuckling."Why do you have to yield to Li Hao?"BOOM!A great battle broke out. The Dali King was too lazy to listen to this and attacked directly!However, Ying Hongyue didn't interfere. The flying sword immortal and the others were also very powerful. Although they were weaker than the Dali King and the others, they could still resist for a while. Ying Hongyue just kept looking at Qian Wuliang.,m He frowned.Qian Wuliang smiled brightly."Ying Hongyue, it's fine if you want to pull me into your team. You can do that when you have completely gotten rid of the power of the Crimson Moon. You are not qualified to do that now!""Your Majesty, be careful of the forbidden sea's turbulence ..."The Dali King was stunned. The next moment, he punched the ground. With a loud bang, a River emerged from the ground. The river swept across the world, covering the sky and earth, corroding everything and spreading quickly.The surroundings were quickly corroded into an ocean.The Dali King's expression changed!This corrosive power was so powerful?If this continued, wouldn't Dali be in trouble?As for Ying Hongyue, she reached out her hand and made a grabbing motion, stirring up the underground river. However, she was still frowning at Qian Wuliang, who was also looking at her. After a while, she said again,"He doesn't dare to spread any further. If it does, the forbidden Sea will go out of control. He won't be able to control it. At that time, he will be finished!" Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Ying Hongyue's expression changed again as she coldly looked at him."Interesting. I'm sure now that you can read people's minds! Qian Wuliang, this is not an ability worth showing off. Li Hao and his people won't tolerate you!""Thank you, chief Ying. The Marquis is more open-minded than you thought." Qian Wuliang laughed.As soon as he finished speaking, a force emerged.Divine power burst out!All of a sudden, the members of the three major organizations lost control and started to roar like wild beasts.Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly!Damn it!"Hmph!""Hmph!" A cold snort resounded through the heavens and earth. The crazed members all quieted down, but in just a short while, a large number of them had been killed by the divine guards and temple priests.

2074 Chapter 351
At this moment, Qian Wuliang's voice resounded."Leader Ying, hand over the Yama, the flying sword immortal, or the heavenly Mountain Lord. If you do that, I will stop chasing after you. Otherwise ...""What a joke!"Ying Hongyue snorted coldly and instantly appeared in front of him. A long whip appeared in her hand. She lashed out with the whip, and the void shattered.Qian Wuliang disappeared in an instant. The next moment, a Golden Glove smashed toward him.In the sky, Jiang Li roared and his body turned into white bones. In an instant, he took over King Dali's position and suppressed the other three leaders with his strong power of the initial stage of martial arts! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Ying Hongyue immediately frowned.It wasn't going well for him to meet Qian Wuliang.The other party could pry into people's hearts!But ... Why is he able to track us so many times?He thought that his whereabouts were secretive, and even if he was really a worm in his stomach, he shouldn't be able to track them down instantly every time, let alone spy on people's hearts.He looked down at the members of the three major organizations and suddenly realized something."Qian Wuliang must have left some marks on these members, but I didn't notice them. As long as I take these members with me, I won't be able to get rid of him."More importantly, this person's Mark had actually escaped his detection!Not far away, Qian Wuliang's eyes flickered and he said in a low voice,""Chief Ying, you can't be thinking of abandoning the others and running away alone, right? As the hegemon of a region, you killed all of your followers in order to avoid danger ... Who would dare to follow such a person?"Ying Hongyue was a little angry!A powerful force suddenly appeared and covered Qian Wuliang. Qian Wuliang felt pain in his eyes and laughed,""Amazing, leader Ying is probably invincible in this world. Your Majesty, be careful. This person still has some power hidden in his body, but he's afraid that if he erupts too strongly, it will attract the attention of heaven's will. He has the power of the Crimson Moon in his body, and the bloodlines of the eight great families are also unbalanced. Could it be ... In the forbidden Sea?"Ying Hongyue's expression changed a bit. In the next moment, she roared and lashed out with her whip, which knocked away King Dali's gloves. She disappeared instantly and reappeared above Qian Wuliang's head.This time, a pair of gloves appeared on his hands. It was the Zhao family's fist.He threw a punch at Qian Wuliang! This person must die.Otherwise, it would be too dangerous. How dare Li Hao recruit this person? wasn't he afraid of dying at his hands?This Qian Wuliang ... Was willing to follow Li Hao's orders. It seemed that Li Hao had made great progress these days. Otherwise, how could Qian Wuliang be so easily controlled by Li Hao?This punch had an extremely strong explosive force!The king of Dali was shocked to see that Qian Wuliang was about to be killed in one punch. If Qian Wuliang were to die Here, he would have a hard time explaining to Li Hao.He didn't expect Ying Hongyue to be so powerful. When Li Hao told him to be careful, he didn't take it seriously. Now, he realized he was wrong! Ying Hongyue's explosive power was close to the sixth or seventh stage of the sun Moon realm. It was extremely terrifying!Qian Wuliang was only at the fourth stage of Sun Moon realm.Just when he was feeling a little anxious, Qian Wuliang suddenly disappeared. Even Ying Hongyue didn't see how he disappeared, and Qian Wuliang's punch hit nothing, which surprised Jiang Chen a little.The next moment, he seemed to have realized something and suddenly shouted,""Break the whims!"BOOM!The energy exploded and the void shook. In a flash, Qian Wuliang reappeared with blood on the corner of his mouth. He said in disbelief,"What a powerful technique ..."Ying Hongyue frowned and said,"you are even more powerful. You actually affected my perception. You were right next to me, but I didn't notice you. Qian Wuliang ... Your ability is so strange. Li Hao is a righteous man, but I told you that he can't tolerate you.""Why would I ..." Qian Wuliang laughed.In the next moment, he fled frantically.As for Ying Hongyue, she instantly appeared at the place where he had just left. She was a little solemn. This guy's ability was too strange. He even had the feeling that he could predict in advance. She hadn't even made a move, but he already knew that she was going to make a move.What a troublesome fellow!Li Hao had his own plans for letting this guy deal with him.The king of Dali attacked again. This time, he was also furious. Boxing gloves suddenly appeared on his fists. With a roar, his Iron Fists burst out and shattered the void in an instant!This time, he took out a second glove. When Ying Hongyue saw this, she could only sigh helplessly.This king of Dali ... Was also an idiot!"Retreat!""Run!" He shouted and instantly disappeared. The flying sword immortal and the others all had sullen expressions as they fled. Below them, a large number of members of the three large organizations were killed!Before they left, they had managed to take away some of them. However, out of the tens of thousands of members before, they could only take away less than one-tenth of them.The four great leaders were all frantically fleeing.Just as the Dali King was about to chase after him, Qian Wuliang came back again and shook his head. "Don't chase! If he continued to chase, Ying Hongyue would explode ... And grind him down bit by bit! Let's go to the Cang mountains. If they want to escape, they'll probably go to the West. Inform the Marquis and have him seal off the divine Kingdom ..."The Dali King frowned slightly and glanced at him. After a long while, he said,""Don't stare at me, this King feels uncomfortable looking at you! If I were Li Hao...I would just kill someone like you!""So ... Your Majesty is not a Marquis, is it?" Qian Wuliang laughed.The king of Dali snorted and didn't bother to say anything more.

2075 Chapter 351
At this moment, she wondered if Li Hao couldn't stand this guy anymore since he had been thrown to her side.Every time, before you even opened your mouth, the other party seemed to know what you were going to do or say. This was very uncomfortable."Qian Wuliang," he suddenly said after a moment of silence,"you shouldn't use this ability of yours. Otherwise ... I think you'll be dead!""Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty ..."‚Äã Qian Wuliang laughed."No need ... It's more worrying. If we don't use it, won't we have other plans?"The Dali King was speechless!This was also true!Knowing his ability but not using it, wouldn't that make him even more worried?It was really contradictory."Besides, you don't really care about these things. Your Majesty, you've underestimated you," Qian Wuliang added."Is that so?"The king of Dali did not comment and did not say anything more.He looked in the direction that Ying Hongyue and the others had left and said in a deep voice,"This person is extremely difficult to deal with. After a few times, I only managed to get rid of a few of my subordinates ...""That's enough!"Qian Wuliang's smile was bright."Grind him bit by bit. Grind all of his men away. Make him a loner and a stray dog. That's what the Marquis likes more!" Even if he could kill this person, he couldn't kill him rashly. Otherwise ... It could easily lead to a big change! What we need to do is to get rid of his wings and let his years of accumulation go to waste! It was a good thing that he had escaped to the West, but his people could not escape! Send him to the West ... This man is ambitious, and the moon goddesses of the West may not be able to defeat him. If he can take the power of the Silver Moon, he will be able to restrain the red moon Emperor and reduce the Marquis's number of enemies by one ... The seal will not be affected even if one of them dies in their battle. Only their battle can cause such a thing ..."The Dali King frowned slightly but did not say anything.Ying Hongyue's relationship was sealed, and so was the moon goddess. If these two people were to fight, they would be restricting each other.However, he said,"Li Hao isn't afraid of raising a Tiger. If the two of them combine, perhaps they'll be more difficult to deal with?""Not as hard to deal with as venerable sovereigns!"Qian Wuliang shook his head."What you want is for them to restrict the venerable sovereign. It's good that Ying Hongyue wins. Otherwise, yueshen's rashness will trigger the seal. Ying Hongyue won, but he's too smart to trigger it. You want him to win!" The Dali King's expression changed slightly, Li Hao knew all this in advance?"I don't know ... I'm saying that I don't know. It's just a guess. After all, if the Marquis really wanted to kill Ying Hongyue, he might have been able to do so long ago. This time, he only asked me to come. Perhaps he had this intention ..."He laughed."I'm not trying to guess what the Marquis is thinking. Your Majesty, please don't misunderstand. I'm just stating my judgment."The king of Dali frowned and said nothing.He cursed in his heart!Li Hao didn't think much of it before, but now, he felt that none of them were good people.I'll let you fight!As long as Ying Hongyue left the Li Dynasty, he couldn't be bothered to care about what happened to other places.It's good that he's leaving. I hope this guy can get out of here soon. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  If Qian Wuliang didn't leave, he wouldn't feel good either.Qian Wuliang said again,"Your Majesty, as long as you help me kill one of the other three leaders, I will leave. Among the other three leaders, Yama is the easiest to kill. He has been so frustrated recently that he is about to explode ... As long as you give him a little stimulation, he will definitely choose to stay and fight to the death. I will kill him next time!"After saying that, he looked back to the South.That was where Silvermoon was.Although he had only been away for a few days, he knew that Li Hao had not been idle. He must be planning something. If he didn't return now, he would miss the opportunity and might fall behind again.He had to quickly kill a leader and return as soon as possible.Today, there were opportunities everywhere.He also didn't want to continue fighting with Ying Hongyue. This person was extremely difficult to deal with, and he couldn't kill her easily. If they continued fighting, he would only be at a disadvantage. Right now, he was only taking advantage of the fact that Ying Hongyue didn't understand him, so he had the upper hand."Forcing the other party to go to the West is enough ... This is probably what Lord Marquis is thinking, right?"This thought flashed through his mind, but he became vigilant. He couldn't think about it anymore. If he thought about this again and again, something might happen next time.

2076 Chapter 352
Bright star sector.The void changed, and the great stars shifted.Li Hao teleported the stars again and again as he roamed the void.After an unknown period of time, there was a loud boom. The heavens and earth were turned upside down, and the heavens were plunged into darkness. All the great stars disappeared without a trace, as if they had entered the darkness and chaos.As for Li Hao, he was also panting from exhaustion.As he was wandering in the void, wind, fire, Thunder, and lightning suddenly burst out. In an instant, light shone, darkness descended, the five elements burst out, and swords, Spears, and halberds were all launched ...At this moment, Li Hao smiled.However, he soon frowned.Fixed entrance.Difficult!According to li Fuhai, the universe had a Center, which was very difficult to find. Li Hao gave up for the time being, but a fixed entrance and exit were still very necessary. He couldn't appear in a different place every time he tore the void.It was possible to connect to the bright star sector, but ... How could he carry it?Director Wang and the others used the great Dao of origins to carry it, but Li Hao didn 't.The starry sky sword was actually a pretty good vessel, but it was a pity that it was broken.To fix a hole ... What should I use?Li Hao looked through his storage ring. He had quite a few divine weapons, among which the strongest one was only the secondary wind and cloud treasure mirror. The commander's armor he had just obtained was also good, but it was nothing compared to it.He didn't lack divine weapons. What he lacked were truly powerful divine weapons.The divine weapon bearing ... Was somewhat unfeasible."If the divine weapon can't bear the load ... What about the body? If the physical body can't ... Then the great Dao?"Many thoughts appeared in his mind.The great Dao created by the divine runes ... Was it like a tributary opening up a hole in the bright star sector?It could even take the initiative to connect to him and pour the power of a great Dao into him?He had never thought about this before.But now, it had been taken into Li Hao's consideration. Sitting cross-legged in the universe, he began to consider how to weave the great Dao and form the entrance with a fixed location.What great Dao would be more suitable?And what Dao would he need next?Li Hao had temporarily put aside the path of divine powers and given the five elements to others. Now, he only had wind, Thunder, light, and darkness Divine powers, as well as his physical divine power."Using the corporeal body Divine Art as the foundation?"His thoughts kept flashing.‚Äã With Dao as the carrier!Would this work?Also, if the enemy discovered it, would they destroy it?One could imagine that with the great Dao hanging above one's head, others would be able to tell at a glance that he was an extraordinary person. Unless ... He could completely cover the great Dao, like the great Dao of origins, completely hiding in the void."The dark element fused with the physical body Dao?" The thought surfaced once more.The dark element could hide everything?The great Dao originated from the bright star realm, and it could be used as a penetrating barrier. However, he was afraid that the enemy would take the initiative to break it. In that case, the Dao Meridian would break, which was equivalent to the great Dao breaking. Once the origin of the great Dao was broken, the person would die.The new human beings would not die. They did not only have one Dao Meridian, but many. They would not die if one was broken, but their strength would be greatly reduced.Li Hao looked up at the sky and fell into deep thought.How could he ensure the safety of the Dao Meridian and prevent it from being destroyed?He then looked at the great Dao universe that he had concealed. What if ... He used the great Dao universe as the source and the foundation of living water?All sorts of thoughts moved him.Someone had once said that as long as he didn't die, he would give it a try.The next moment, Li Hao waved his hand, and a sword of the great path appeared in the area of sword principle in the void. It slashed down, and a crack appeared in the center of the circular area. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé Li Hao arrived quickly and punched out. The void trembled, and cracks appeared in the great Dao universe.The universe of the great path was extremely solid.Wu Peng, who was a Saint-level master, couldn't break through it at all. However, Li Hao was relaxed, because Li Hao actually knew the meridians of the Dao universe. It was impossible to break through the Dao universe if one attacked randomly."You only have a chance of breaking the connection points of each Dao Meridian.It didn't mean that you could just punch through any spot.The connection point of the Dao Meridian was not actually where the vast star was. The vast star was just a position that Li Hao had shifted. The connection point of the Dao Meridian was the area where the vast star had first appeared. In this vast universe, if Li Hao had shifted the vast star, one would not be able to find it at all.Perhaps Li Hao was the only one who knew where the connection point was.Of course, if he was lucky, he might be able to create an opening with a casual attack ... The probability of that was too small!Breaking through the void, Li Hao looked outside. The outside world was vast, and he didn't even know the exact location.He had just randomly punched a hole in a place.He instantly disappeared from the bright star realm and reappeared on a snowy mountain.Silver Moon needed to use him as a point.He was also the one who set the coordinates for the fixed entrance and exit. It was not fixed at will.The bright star sector, on the other hand, used the center of the ring-shaped star as a point to truly establish a connection with the bright star sector.From now on, it would form an exclusive passage.With a soft shout, several thick Dao meridians appeared in Li Hao's body like divine Dragons.The Dao Meridian appeared!A total of five!His physical body consisted of wind, lightning, light, and darkness!The five Dao meridians intertwined like five giant Dragons. In an instant, countless energy from all directions was drawn away by him. Li Hao didn't care. He looked at the sky and frowned.Five Dao meridians wasn't weak, but ... It wasn't enough!At the thought of this, many divine weapons appeared in his storage ring. In the next moment, they all shattered and turned into pure energy, which was then integrated into his storage ring.

2077 Chapter 352
It was still not enough!The five giant Dragons swallowed and swallowed everything, but they still did not feel solid enough.Li Hao pondered for a while and quickly took out a large amount of spring of life and ores.He didn't know how to forge.However, it didn't matter. It didn't matter if he didn't know how to use it. At most, he would just waste some. It was fine as long as it was strong enough.One by one, the divine weapons shattered and fused into it. Pillars of energy also fused into it.At this moment, it was as if a huge treasure had appeared in the world.Rebirth!On the snowy mountain, a green color suddenly appeared. In the blink of an eye, the green color spread and the snow disappeared. Spring had arrived and everything was revived.On top of the mountain, a big demon was trembling and didn't dare to move.Since this place could be opened, there must have been a Dao Meridian that had been connected to the bright star Universe. Li Hao did not care. Perhaps someone had cultivated here and opened the Dao Meridian.Of course, whether it was the demon in front of him ... It was hard to say.Do you have a demonic Dao Meridian? Heibao had not come out of his closed-door training.Li Hao had wanted to take the black Panther away, but he had sensed that the Panther's aura was unstable. It might be at a critical moment, so Li Hao had no choice but to give up on taking it away. If a demon accidentally opened its Dao Meridian, the Black Panther would be in trouble ... It would be worse off than a random wild demon if it had spent many days in seclusion.Li Hao didn't care about this.He continued to stabilize the new passageway.A moment later, it seemed that experts appeared in the surroundings and stepped on the air. In the distance, they saw a person standing on the mountain and were somewhat surprised. They originally thought that there was a Supreme treasure here, but someone had actually arrived before them?When he got closer to take a look ... He was instantly scared out of his wits!"Governor li!"In the distance, an expert saw Li Hao, and his face instantly turned pale. Li Hao turned his head to look, but didn't recognize him. He nodded slightly and said calmly,""I'm cultivating here. Where ... Is this place?"Training?Oh my God!He looked at the giant dragon flying in the sky. The energy was like a pillar of light. Was this cultivation?"Governor li ... This place ... Is within the Fushan mountain range. It is located between Cang Mountain and kui mountain and is part of the northern region."The North?He had actually returned to the North.Li Hao nodded slightly and looked at the man. He was not weak and seemed to have opened some Dao meridians. He was an expert of the mountain and sea realm.And now, there were actually very few experts who had the battle power of the mountain and sea realm without joining the governor's office. The man didn't look too old. Of course, he looked to be in his forties or fifties.Seeing Li Hao's gaze, he was a little afraid, but ... He suppressed his fear and took the initiative to say,""I shouldn't have disturbed Governor Li's cultivation, but I'm really curious. This giant dragon ... Could it be ... A Dao Meridian?""Yes,""What?" the person was shocked and muttered,"his Dao Meridian is like a giant dragon. He can actually cultivate it to such a powerful level. The governor is indeed a God!"Li Hao looked at the newcomer."Anyone can do it. It's a matter of time. Who are you?""Governor, my name is Sage Chao Bai."Sage Chaobai?Li Hao seemed to have thought of something and said,""In the past, I once traveled the northern lands and reached the ends of the northern lands. I heard that there were two forces, the White saint cult and the Montenegro bandits. The Black Mountain bandits committed all kinds of evil, and the White saint cult was said to be the living Buddha of all clans, saving people from disaster. Are you the cult leader of the White saint cult?""It's me. ""I don't deserve to be called the living Buddha of ten thousand families ..." The man hurriedly said."I've seen it with my own eyes once," Li Hao said calmly."The White Saint believers set fire to a village and forced the villagers to join the sect and pretend to be Montenegro bandits. I wanted to kill them all and get rid of evil for the people ..."At that moment, Sage Chao White's face turned deathly pale!Li Hao continued."Later, I heard them say that if they didn't force people to leave, the village would be exterminated once the Montenegro bandits arrived. I thought, how can one tell right from wrong in this world?" The White Saint church pretended to be mountain bandits and set the village on fire. Are they forcing people to become bandits, or are they saving people from fire and water?"Sage Chao Bai swallowed his saliva. He had not expected that Li Hao would know about the White saint cult and had even seen the way they did things. At this moment, he did not know what Li Hao meant. He only regretted that he had left earlier. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé It was too dangerous!When Li Hao started training, he was too terrifying. Just his aura alone was enough to make him feel like his liver and guts were splitting.He wanted to take a look, but in the end ... He was afraid that he couldn't leave!As for Li Hao, he had indeed seen the other party's methods with his own eyes. At that time, he had been on his way to the Xu family in the East and had passed by this place. In the end, he had seen this scene and decided not to care.Who would have thought that today, he would meet the sect master by accident.Li Hao continued."The fact that you were able to enter the mountains and seas is comparable to your abilities in the past. You have good talent, good means, and great courage. You know that I'm cultivating here, but you still dare to stay. Perhaps you have some covetous thoughts ...""I wouldn't dare. Commander, you've misunderstood ..."Li Hao said softly,"it's fine!" Greed was in everyone's heart! Restrain oneself, restrain one's heart, and restrain one's actions! A Saint can be judged by his tracks and not his heart. Even if he's in disguise, he can pretend to be a Saint for a lifetime and become a true Saint!"Chao Sheng was stunned. He looked at Li Hao, but did not say anything."It's a coincidence that we met here," Li Hao said."If you help me with something, I'll give you an opportunity. How about it?"Sage Chao white was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly said,""Commander, please give me your orders. I dare not disobey.""It's not an order. It's up to you to do it or not ..."Li Hao looked at him."The White saint cult is one of the few cult organizations that still exist today. I've gathered the four continents, but I haven't had time to clean up the various sects ... Your white saint cult has a good reputation and still exists today ... Help me gather those who are unwilling to submit to me. Let all the rebels, villains, and bandits join your white saint cult, and gather all the escaped villains. What do you think?"

2078 Chapter 352
Sage Chao Bai's expression changed."I wouldn't dare. If you're worried, I'll disband the sect immediately ... The White saint cult was formed by a group of poor people. It was originally to resist the imperial family of the Jiusi Empire, but it was later destroyed by you ...""No!"Li Hao shook his head and said,"it's better to gather!" "I'm very busy. My people are all very busy. No one is in the mood, no mind, no time, no energy to solve them one by one. We don't have the time to gather together and clean up the world! The White saint cult doesn't have much of a relationship with me, so no one knows that we have met today. It's fate!""I can bestow you with the Dao of light and a powerful Dao Meridian. Perhaps it can help you step into the sun Moon realm in a day, and you'll be able to sweep across the world! Gather all the evil in the world and annihilate them in one day! Once you succeed, you can join the governor's office. How about it?"It was aimed at Sage white.He felt a chill in his heart!Li Hao!This leader who was rumored to be like a Saint was actually ... Actually so cold.He actually wanted him to attract all the villains in the world to join the White saint cult and capture them all in one fell swoop. Was this the Saint that was rumored in the outside world?This ... Was really terrifying.Rejected?He couldn't refuse!He didn't dare to say much. He quickly said,"Saint white is duty-bound to annihilate evil. There is no need to reward you, commander. It is what Saint white should do ...""Martial strength isn't the only thing. Without martial strength, it's hard to suppress the world! In the extraordinary world, martial strength and wisdom are at the same level ... If you accept my path of light, I can find you at any time and restrain you. Of course, you can refuse ...""Many thanks for the reward, Governor!"Sage Chaobai no longer mentioned the matter of rejecting him. If he were to reject him now, he was worried that he would not be able to leave. It was too terrifying.  Best novel online free at ’≤÷Ö—µ“Ωl’≥√≠’≤  This Li Hao ... Did not look like a Sage at all.This was a formidable person!Everyone in the world had misunderstood him.In the next moment, one of the five dragons flew away and quickly fell into Saint Chaobai's body. With a loud boom, Saint Chaobai's body almost exploded. Fortunately, in the next moment, the power of light burst forth and helped him protect his body.Li Hao glanced at the four dragons in the sky and heaved a sigh of relief. He had given them the path of light because he had no choice. Darkness and light were intertwined and difficult to stabilize!With the path of light, it was easy to be exposed, causing the concealment effect of the path of darkness to be much worse.He was just about to give up on the path of light when he met this person who claimed to be Holy and pure. Was this heaven's will?The heavens 'will ... Li Hao smiled. It might not be the will of heaven, but the will of the great Dao.There were people who cultivated the radiant path, and the radiant sword was one of them.However, the light sword had already reached the peak of the third level of the sun Moon tier and was about to reach the fourth level, so it didn't need Li Hao's great Dao.Since he had encountered them ... He would just place a stone.As for Sage Chao Bai, it was only now that he felt the might of Li Hao's power. It was only a Dao Meridian, but to him, the power within his body was rapidly rising. Initially, he had only entered the early stage of the mountain sea realm, but in the blink of an eye, his aura was approaching the mid stage. Not long after, he broke through the mid stage and began to cross into the late stage of the mountain sea realm. Chao White's face was ferocious as he growled continuously.Li Hao extended his hand, and a Dao Meridian appeared in his body. Li Hao said,""Open this Dao Meridian. This is the Dao Meridian of the physical body. It can not be taught to outsiders!"Saint Chaobai's expression changed drastically, and he did not dare to say anything more. He quickly gathered energy to open his meridians.Before long, a powerful force broke through his physical body's Dao Meridian. Soon, his body began to grow stronger. His body, which had felt like it was about to explode, began to calm down. Li Hao, on the other hand, just watched silently and continued to stabilize his path.After a while, Sage White's aura climbed. With a boom, it was as if he had broken through a bottleneck, and his aura suddenly became extremely powerful.The sun and the moon!Soon, his breathing began to calm down, and he couldn't help but bow in agitation.""Thanks for your help, military governor ...""I didn't fulfill your wish."Li Hao said calmly,"I'm only lending this Meridian to you. I haven't completely integrated it with you. Otherwise ... How could you have integrated my Dao Meridian so easily? I'll give it to you after you succeed!"Saint Chaobai was still grateful."Thank you, Governor. After meeting you today, I realized that you are a frog at the bottom of a well. You don't know how high the sky is.""No need! I still have to cultivate, and you're leaving on your own ... It's up to you whether you want to do it or not! There are countless wicked people in the world, so there's no need to care too much about them. It's enough to just get rid of some famous wicked people and recruit them!""Your subordinate understands!"At this moment, Li Hao didn't care that he had become a subordinate.It didn't matter if he placed a piece casually or not.There were too many villains in the world!Heavenly Star had been corrupted for many years. Even if Li Hao controlled the world, it would be difficult to arrest him in a short time.If Sage Chaobai could really catch all the villains in the world in one fell swoop, he would have made outstanding contributions.Seeing that Li Hao was no longer paying attention to him, Sage Chaobai did not dare to say anything more and left quickly. He was both nervous and excited. He had not found any treasure today, but the benefits he had obtained were not inferior to that of treasure hunting.From the early stage of the mountain sea realm, he had become a sun Moon expert.Even though ... This power didn't actually belong to him, what did it matter?Sage Chaobai was extremely excited.He left happily.Li Hao, on the other hand, had a profound look in his eyes. He glanced at him, then turned his head to look in another direction. There was another great demon there, the Mount kui Snake King, who had long entered the divine-tier.In the past, the Snake King had been instructed by someone and started cultivating early. Later, Li Hao said a few things, and the Snake King quickly became a divine power. It had been a while since they last met, and he wondered what level the Snake King had reached now.Middle stage of the mountain sea realm?Or even the later stage?Everything was possible!Since Saint Chaobai had helped him to gather all the villains in the world, perhaps it was time to go to kuishan. Since he was already here, he wanted to meet the Snake King. That day, he had asked the Snake King to gather the demons from all over the world. How was the Snake King doing?

2079 Chapter 352
The passage of the great path in the air had become much more stable.Li Hao didn't feel any heartache at the destruction of a large number of treasures.There were still some secrets in the Silver Moon land that he had yet to discover. For example ... Who had given the Snake King some pointers?Was it the Zheng family who had spread the folk song?Also, the other seven families were easy to deal with, but why was the Li family able to bring the starry sky sword out of the sealed sword city and into the Silver City?Also, why did the human Queen leave her inheritance here?The Silver Moon was only a small world. How could it have left behind so many special inheritances, including the inheritance of celestial ruler BA, which was also obtained by King Dali?On the other hand, the sword Saint who was in charge of Silver Moon did not leave anything good behind.On the other hand, the blood Emperor, who had been here once, had left behind two words and something else.‚Äã What was left in the ruins of Star Town?All sorts of thoughts appeared in his mind.While stabilizing the passage, Li Hao turned his head to look at the end of the North, which seemed to penetrate the mountains. He mumbled,""Qian Wuliang went over there. It's going to be a good show for Ying Hongyue to meet Qian Wuliang. Qian Wuliang can see through people's hearts and deal with people's hearts with people's hearts. With the existence of the Li Dynasty King and Jiang Li ..."He was thinking that with Ying Hongyue's treachery, she would definitely not continue to stay in the Li Dynasty.Other than the Li Dynasty, no one else would come to the land of the Silver Moon.Then where could he go?The vast wilderness was too dangerous.There was no one else in shuiyun.He could only go to the Western Kingdom of God!Could the moon goddess defeat Ying Hongyue?Li Hao also believed that there must be some people from the Crimson Moon world, but they had never appeared. Li Hao guessed that they had probably gone to hunt down the moon goddess. It would be a good show."Gather all the enemies together ... Don't run around. That's the best."The world was in chaos!He wanted to peel the silk from the cocoon and sort them out bit by bit, just like how he sorted out the great Dao. He wanted to put these people together.Be it demons, humans, ancient people, or modern people, they all had to be put together so that it would be easier to deal with them. Even if they were stronger together, it was better than hiding in the dark and planning this and that.Li Hao wasn't afraid of powerful enemies, but he was afraid that these guys would hide and not show themselves. That would be a big problem.He thought in his heart.The next moment, Li Hao teleported and appeared in the familiar land of Mount kui.Soon, he felt a powerful aura that disappeared instantly.When he reappeared, he was already in a huge Canyon. The Snake King, who had been sleeping soundly, suddenly opened its huge eyes, which were filled with an ominous glint. The next moment, it saw the person who had arrived and was startled. It quickly coiled up its huge body and slightly bent it. "Meng she greets great senior!"Li Hao smiled, glanced at it, and nodded.""The fish leaps over the Dragon's Gate. Ever since you broke through to the divine power realm, you've improved at a rapid pace. Now, you're comparable to the seventh level of the mountain sea realm. For a demon who hasn't opened his Dao Meridian to have such divine powers, that's extraordinary!""Great senior, you're too kind ..."Li Hao didn't say anything. He looked around and said,""You've recruited many demons?""Yes ... Grandmaster asked me to build a sacred ground for the demon race in Mount kui. With the recent changes, many demon races have come to Mount kui to seek refuge ... I heard that sky sword and BA Dao, two of the strongest, are currently clearing the seven divine mountains and clearing out the gathering of the masses. Another batch of demons has entered Mount kui, and now there are close to 10000 demon races in Mount kui! However, there aren't many powerful people ..."It was already a lot!Li Hao sensed it and nodded,"yes!" After identifying all the demons who had eaten humans, he would use these demons as the vanguard to fight against the White saint cult at the foot of the mountain. When he met Saint Chao Bai, he would tell him that he said it! He should understand what I mean, and you should do the same. I don't care how you two have a conflict. I only need to keep the people I need and the Yao I need!"Thinking of this, Li Hao added,"it's easy to find a reason. Sage Chao White's strength has increased greatly and he has obtained a treasure. Snake King, can you understand my feelings?"How could he not understand?The Snake King immediately nodded its huge head,""This little snake understands! Great senior can rest assured, I won't let great senior down!"Li Hao nodded and said,"you said that an expert guided you in the past. Now, you've become much stronger and can recall more. Do you have any other clues?"Forest Viper quickly fell into deep thought.After a long time, the other party spoke."I was too ignorant and weak back then. I didn't have much perception. Thinking back now, maybe ... Maybe ... The other party is the same as Grandmaster. Are they both sword cultivators?"A swordsman?Li Hao's heart moved.A sword cultivator?This was interesting.Could it be that he was not the father and son of the Zheng family?Those who could travel the world in that era were definitely not ordinary people. At that time, the powerhouses of the ancient cities were all in deep sleep. He had even suspected that the father and son of the Zheng family were passing by and had casually given him a few pointers.It was very normal. Even if they were bad guys, it didn't mean that bad guys didn't have the heart to point things out. When their interest was piqued, anything was possible.However, the Zheng family's father and son did not cultivate the sword Dao.He thought of one person.Li daoheng!He was the elder brother of the ninth master!It was said that when sun Xin rebelled back then, he was the one who personally went to persuade him. However, ever since sword city disappeared, this person seemed to have been completely sealed.  Best novel online free at ’º÷Ö ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  But ... Someone who knew about the existence of the Crimson Moon, knew that someone had betrayed him, and even planned all of this, was he really going to be sealed away?Together with Red Moon Emperor and sword city, they were sealed near the Stargate?
