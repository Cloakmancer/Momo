        ast of the East Sea.
         A slightly desolate seaside villa stood.
         However, at this moment, the villa reeked of blood.
         "Unlucky!" Yuan Shuo cursed.
         His house was still there, but it had become a stronghold for the Pirates. When he came, several Pirates were discussing how to escape. It was not because Yuan Shuo had come, but because the East China Sea pirates had suffered a heavy blow this time.
         Redbeard had been killed, and the city-destroying bomb had killed a large number of Pirates. These few felt that they couldn't survive these days, so they wanted to change places and become Pirates.
         Yuan Shuo finished them off in a few moves and was a little depressed.""I spent a lot of money on this house back then. It's fine if it's gone, but it's actually being used as a nest by these guys. How unlucky!"
         The few of them were too lazy to care.
         To them, money did not matter.
         At this moment, Li Hao and the others didn't care about the smell of blood. They casually threw the corpse in the backyard and began to heal their injuries.
          This time, a large number of divine power stones appeared.
         Sword energy emerged.
         In an instant, the entire living room was filled with sword energy. This time, everyone was injured, and the two of them had even unsealed themselves. Black Panther's injuries were not light either. Without the high-grade divine power stones, the low-grade ones would only be able to break and transform continuously.
         The few of them didn't think about the outside world's turmoil.
         They didn't care what happened to the Xu family.
         This place was isolated, so he wasn't afraid of people sensing anything. The main thing was that this was the pirate's stronghold. Some people in the East Coast might know about it, and ordinary people didn't dare to come to the Pirates 'place.
         In the following time, the few of them were cultivating and repairing.
         Time slowly passed by.
         This time, the consumption was not small. Everyone was madly swallowing and spitting out sword energy. If it was in the past, the sword energy might not be enough, but this time, the small sword seemed to have become stronger after Swallowing the Earth Dragon Soldier soul.
         In this way, the conversion speed was even faster, but the divine power stones were consumed a little too quickly.
         Yuan Shuo and black Panther were absorbing the energy crazily. However, Hong Yitang and the light sword didn't consume as much energy as they did after unsealing the seal. The light sword couldn't help but glance at the man and the dog. They were both gluttons who only took in energy but didn't take it out. How fast they absorbed!
         The breathing technique of five birds was good at absorbing sword energy.
         Yuan Shuo had just perfected the fusion of the five Forces, and he was actually very empty at the moment. After the great battle, he had been completely drained. At this moment, the swords could be seen being devoured by the naked eye, and it seemed that no matter how many swords he had, it would not be enough.
         Four people and one dog, all of them had consumed a lot of energy.
         This time, Li Hao wasn't stingy. Last time, he had searched for the light sword. This time, everyone was here to save him, so he naturally had to be generous. The divine energy stone was shattered as if it was free.
         No one shouted for him to stop. Even though he had recovered from his injuries, he continued to shatter.
         Three thousand, eight thousand, ten thousand, fifteen thousand ...
         After spending a total of 20000 divine power stones, the Black Panther's fur had grown out, and Hong Yitang and the light sword had also stopped their practice, Yuan Shuo finally opened his eyes and said,""Alright, I'll stop cultivating for now!"
          In the living room, the divine power Stone fragments were almost piled up into a mountain.  With a wave of his hand, Li Hao collected the fragments and put them into his storage ring. He had more storage rings than he could count.
         "Teacher, have you recovered from your injuries?"
         "If you don't have any, I still have a few drops of the spring of life," Li Hao said.
         He had brought 15 drops with him.
         However, he had used up eight drops, and only seven drops were left.
         However, the spring of life was indeed very useful. During a battle, there were times when the sword energy could not be replenished in time, and there was no time to heal the wounds. This thing took effect quickly, although the long-lasting effect did not feel as good as the sword energy.
         Li Hao was reluctant to use the remaining 7 drops.
         "No need for that now!"
         Yuan Shuo shook his head and cursed in his heart. Fool.
         With these two here, what use was there?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If we use it, wouldn't it be embarrassing to not give one or two drops to others?
         It's fine if you can let him use your sword, but you got some spring of life from God knows where and only know how to show off.
         Hong Yitang and the other man knew what he was thinking. Hong Yitang laughed and didn't say anything. It didn't matter if they used the spring of life or not. They didn't have any serious injuries.
         This thing was actually best used at other times, such as when a leg was broken. It could stimulate the regeneration of flesh and blood. In fact, the effect of using a sword was not bad.
         The few of them stabilized their injuries and recovered their strength.
         At this moment, they all felt a little more at ease.
         At this time, even if Xu Qing came, they could still fight. Only then would they be at ease.
          Yuan Shuo shot a glance at Hong Yitang,"where's Xu Qing's storage ring?" You have the nerve to keep it all by yourself ..."
         Hong Yitang didn't seem to hear him.
         Xu Qing's head had been chopped off by him, so he had just conveniently kept it.
         Seeing that he was silent, Yuan Shuo snorted again,""Li Hao and I fought for a long time against Xu Qing. You only managed to kill him after skysword arrived ... My disciple acknowledges this favor. What, you still want to take away the spoils of war?"
         Hong Yitang laughed, and Li Hao also laughed.""Teacher, just accept senior uncle Hong. We didn't kill him ..."
         Yuan Shuo was extremely sorrowful.
         As expected!
         This stupid kid was so stingy in the past, but now he didn't even want the Duke's storage ring.
         Li Hao just felt that it would fall into his hands sooner or later ... Ahem, no, sooner or later, Hong Yitang would exchange it for sword energy. What's the hurry? teacher doesn't know my tricks. It wouldn't be good if he asked someone else for it.
         We're going to squeeze them dry and then get them back.
        
         Hong Yitang laughed and casually threw out his storage ring. He glanced at Yuan Shuo."Big brother Yuan is still so straightforward, so direct, and so ..."
         He was just short of saying that he was shameless.
         But the meaning was there.
         Yuan Shuo was too lazy to pay attention to him, and only dropped the matter when he saw him throw out his storage ring.
         Li Hao chuckled."Let's not argue about this for now. I'm going to check our gains this time. I've gained too much this time. I've swept through the Xu family's Treasury, and there are many good things that I can't take care of alone. Please help me check."
         As he spoke, he pulled out a long storage ring Necklace from his armor.
         p The few of them were a little speechless!  The Xu family ... Was really screwed over this time.
         Li Hao's harvest this time was too great. The Xu family's treasure vault had been raided, the red-bearded man and the other three suguans had been killed, Xu Xing, general Huang, and the second General Director had been killed, and even Xu Qing had been killed by them.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This time, if Redbeard was counted as one of their men, a total of eight Sunglow-ranked powerhouses from the Xu clan had died.
          And before that, 9 of them had been killed.
         In a short time, the Xu family had lost dozens of sunguang. The loss was incalculable.
         Of course, this also proved that the eastern Overlord had a deep foundation. There were still many powerhouses in the family. The heaven and earth generals were still alive during their transformation, and some foreign ministers and sinecures were still alive. In addition, the old Duke who had just appeared at the sixth level ...
         If there were still strong cultivators in the relic, there were still some rising lights in the Army, and the high Duke's public house was still powerful.
         Only such a force could suppress the East.
         Everyone was speechless when they saw Li Hao take out the long necklace.
         Soon, they took some storage rings and began to count their spoils. There were too many for Li Hao to count on his own.
         ……
         Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care about the divine power stones.
         He focused on some good things.
         In the Xu clan's Treasury, there were mainly some treasures on the second and third floors. There were more than 20 origin divine weapons on the second floor, and three earth-grade origin divine weapons on the third floor. He had eaten the Skygold Lotus, and there was also a token and a weapon fragment.
         The fourth floor, which appeared later, had a mirror.
         These were the treasures in the Treasury.
         Li Hao looked through Xu Xing's storage ring again. There were two origin divine weapons and three drops of the spring of life. It seemed that the second young master of the high Duke's public house had some wealth, but he died too quickly and didn't use it.
         As for general Huang, who had just entered the transformation stage, he was slightly poorer. He had many divine power stones but not many treasures. He only saw a drop of the spring of life, which he kept as a treasure.
         This expert nurtured by the clan was not as wealthy as those who grew up in the wild.
         Even if they managed to snatch any treasure, they would hand it over to the high Duke's public house at the first instance.
         A transformation stage, he was so poor that it was rare to see him.
         Li Hao finally looked at their storage rings. One was red beard 's, and the other was Xu Qing' s.  Redbeard was the leader of the Pirates of the East China Sea.
         During such a transformation period, there would definitely be a lot of treasures. These people would not hide their things anywhere. Pirates would definitely bring good things with them. Only they were the most trustworthy.
         ……
         Li Hao kept taking deep breaths.
         A moment later, the others had also finished counting their gains.
         After a slight calculation, they were all speechless.
         Yuan Shuo said,"there are about 950000 divine energy stones, six origin divine weapons, 1000 ancient armors, and many energy storage rings. I'm too lazy to calculate the amount of mysterious energy." There are also over 100 clones of Blood God, but they don't look too strong. They're usually only at three suns. "
         950 thousand Yuan!
         Hong Yitang and the light sword couldn't help but take a deep breath. They had never seen such a thing before.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was also overjoyed.
         "What?"
         The few of them were stunned. You've only counted a few storage rings, so many?
         "Xu Qing doesn't have many low-level ones, but he does have some big ones like martial uncle Hong 'S. I didn't count them. The main thing is Redbeard. I didn't expect him to carry so many."
         Li Hao smiled and said,"there are 29 origin divine weapons of all levels!" 9 drops of the spring of life ... It's a pity that Xu Qing seems to have used up all of his, but Redbeard has some. "
         These were all common treasures.
         There were some rare items such as weapon fragments, tokens, and mirrors. Red Beard's storage ring also seemed to have some similar treasures.
         "1.15 million divine power stones, 35 origin God weapons, nine drops of spring of life ..."
         The few of them were amazed.
          Yuan Shuo could not help but say,"you're too bold, kid. How dare you Rob the Duke dingguo's mansion? a family like this, with hundreds of years of history, and the Overlord of the East ... No wonder you can make such a big profit. But you have to know that if it weren't for the large number of Silver Moon martial masters coming to help, I'm afraid you wouldn't have been able to escape!"
         "I'm not planning to Rob them. "
         Li Hao said innocently,"I was just going to get the other Windchaser's boots ... This is the inheritance treasure of the eight great families, they can't use it ..."
         They were too lazy to pay attention to him.
         If you went to get the wind-chasing boots, wouldn't you already be prepared to fight the Xu family?
         Otherwise, why would they hand over a few hundred years to you?
         In your dreams!
         Now that he thought about it, Li Hao had three divine weapons of the eight great families.
         At this moment, Li Hao was also thinking that since he had three and heaven battling city still had one, Red Moon would only have four at most.
         In the beginning, he thought that Red Moon had taken everything except his sword and his teacher's saber. Now it seemed that Red Moon had only taken four at most.
        
         The Li clan's sword, the Zhang clan's saber, the Zhao clan's fist, the Liu Clan's leg, the Wang clan's turtle, the Hong clan's hammer, the Zhou clan's spear, and the Zheng clan's burden?
         Li Hao could understand the rest, but he had no idea what kind of treasure the Zheng family was.
         Among all the songs, the Zheng family was the most special.
         The other families had some hints, but the Zheng family, who was dragging them down, had no hints at all.
         Now, the gun, hammer, and fist might all be with the red moon.
         As Li Hao thought about this, he recalled that director Wang from heaven battling city had told him that if he had collected the weapons of the eight great families, he could go to him and borrow them ... Now, he had collected three of them, and he probably wouldn't be able to get the rest until he killed Ying Hongyue.
         No longer thinking about this, Li Hao grinned from ear to ear and said,""I'm really rich this time. However, the divine power stones are only useful if they are converted into power. They are just useless things if they are piled up in storage rings!"
         However, it was impossible for them to absorb all of the one million Yuan. No matter how much this thing absorbed, there was a limit.
         Otherwise, the Xu family wouldn't be so stupid as to keep it in their Treasury.
         To top powerhouses, these low-level divine power stones were not very effective. If they could not be converted into sword energy, they would not be of much use when they absorbed it.
          Yuan Shuo nodded slightly and said,"kid, you've caused a lot of trouble this time. Moreover, no one has completely figured out our background. If someone comes to deal with us next ... If it's still with this strength, we'll probably be in trouble." Even BA Dao and the others, including Tian Jian, might be tricked. "
         Every time he went all out, he would reveal a kind of trump card.
         Once your background is revealed and everyone has a plan in mind, they will be prepared to deal with Silver Moon.
         Therefore, there were very few conflicts between the major forces. Even if there were, the top powerhouses would rarely fight.
         Most of them were just deterrence!
         Like this time, even sky sword Mountain, one of the seven great divine mountains, had a clear understanding of Tian Jian's strength. This might bring some trouble to Tian Jian.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao also nodded.
         Then, he laughed."So, the most important thing now is to strengthen ourselves and not let the enemy figure out our background. When they think that they can finish us off this way, we will surprise them and kill them instead. This will only weaken them."
         It was easy to say!
         Li Hao didn't dwell on this. He quickly said,""Teacher, did you make a new breakthrough in your five birds technique?"
         "Yes."
         Yuan Shuo didn't hide anything. He had always been flamboyant, but he had been suppressed in the past few years. Now that he had broken through, he naturally wouldn't be so low-key. He laughed and said, "I've almost reached the peak of the path of spirit accumulation! Next, it's the spirit fusion!"
         Hong Yitang and the light sword couldn't help but look at him.  "Are you curious?" Yuan Shuo chuckled.
         The two of them didn't say a word.
         Yuan Shuo laughed and said,"that's right!" Don't think that you're strong now, but the path you're taking ... Is over, right?"
         Hong Yitang let out a breath."It's not completely broken. We have some ideas, but it's hard to realize them at the current stage."
         "I know!"
         Yuan Shuo chuckled,"or is it that the problem of the five internal organs can't be solved?" Or was he still worried about whether the Super Lock should break? Am I right?"
         The two of them nodded.
         Not bad.
         This wasn't just a problem for them, it was a problem for all top-notch martial masters.
         At this moment, Yuan Shuo felt great. He laughed and said,""I've straightened out some things. I've mastered many ancient books, but I've also discovered that some of the paths in the ancient books are different from the paths taken by the human race today. The Sanjiao gate in the ancient books, the indestructible golden body, and the path opened by the origin ... Are completely different today!"
         "The ancient people became powerful by walking the path of origin ... But now, it might be different. It's no longer suitable. Our SuperLock might have replaced these."
         Yuan Shuo continued,"at this stage, once you unseal your power, your five organs will suffer the most. According to ancient records, our five organs should be enough to withstand an explosion. However, it's not possible now because our superpower lock is too powerful. Once it breaks ... It will far exceed the explosion recorded in ancient civilization records ..."
          "Do you know why the next realm of Martial Master is called Soul Fusion?" Yuan Shuo asked.
         Hong Yitang raised his brows."That's just the realm you set. Who said the next realm is spirit fusion?"
         "What do you know?"
         "Of course!" Yuan Shuo did not stand on ceremony and continued,"the path of martial masters has yet to be unified. I'll unify it first. Only by following my path will it be Orthodox! "If we follow your path, you might be able to walk a unique path of your own, but your path can't unify the paths of all martial masters."
         Hong Yitang didn't say anything else.
         ? Li Hao, on the other hand, looked at his teacher curiously. Had his teacher made any progress these days?
         At this moment, he really needed his teacher's help.
         Seeing that the teacher was keeping him in suspense, he could only say,""Teacher, the first Soul Fusion stage should be related to the superpower lock, right? Is it to integrate force into the Super Lock, using the Super Lock to store force, then integrate force into the lock, and use the lock to replace the origin Dao of the ancient civilization?"
         Yuan Shuo was stunned and glanced at Li Hao.
         Li Hao continued,"at the current stage, only the two of us have reached the spirit accumulation realm. We need to fuse the five Forces. However, not everyone can do it." "Even I haven't achieved fusion yet ... If that's the case, what about the one force? I'm not sure if teacher has ever read an ancient book, the Five Bridge construction method. This is a method to link up the five internal organs during the ancient civilization era, building the heaven and earth bridge ..."
        
         As Li Hao spoke, he was a little confused."I'm thinking that if the five internal organs can form a cycle, then the five internal organs will be one. In fact, one force will be enough!" It doesn't even need the five Forces, because they've all fused into one ... Does this mean that the five bridges building method is something that all martial masters have to consider and try? but ... How can the five internal organs be built?"
         Yuan Shuo raised his eyebrows and looked at Li Hao for a while.
         It had only been a few months since they last met, and this disciple of his had actually started to think about his own future and path.
         It must be noted that Li Hao had made rapid progress and caused trouble everywhere. This meant that he had seen more things, which was why he had such thoughts.
         At the side, Hong Yitang also said,"the ultra-power locks replaced the bridge in the ancient civilization. The five ultra-power locks formed a ring. However, the ultra-power locks are independent to begin with ... They actually repel each other ... Are we going to use force to resolve the conflict between them?"
         Yuan Shuo was a little depressed.
         He glanced at the two of them and said after a long while,""Alright, I feel like you guys understand it better than I do."
         Despite that, he still nodded and said,"it seems that everyone still has a vague understanding of the path we should take." It doesn't matter how much Shi there is, whether it's one or five. One can become five, and five can become one ... It's just a difference in strength. "
         "Therefore, whether it's one force or Five Forces, the difference isn't big. The only difference is strength, and it doesn't have much effect on the realm."
          "The superpower lock is indeed the key ... But the collapse of the superpower lock is definitely not the right way!"
         "Actually, strictly speaking, Hong Yitang and the rest of you are all in the spirit realm, but it's not obvious."
         He looked at Hong Yitang and then at the light sword."The spirit accumulation stage is to strengthen power and use power to nurture the superpower lock. The superpower lock will strengthen the five internal organs and use the five internal organs to repay the body ..."
         "According to my categorization, all of you are in the transformation stage from spirit accumulation to spirit fusion ... Which is what you call the saturated superpower lock process."
         "Actually, you're all about to succeed ... You're quite capable."
         Hong Yitang laughed. This guy wanted to show off how awesome he was. He had to put on an act.
         "At this stage, martial masters all have power!"
         Yuan Shuo continued,"as Li Hao said just now, it's actually the same whether it's one force or Five Forces. In the end, if you can break through the barrier and connect the five internal organs, one force can also contain the five internal organs!" The key lies in the connection of the Super Lock ... Actually, this problem is a little troublesome ... I've been thinking about it before and I've realized something. "
         He looked at Hong Yitang."The great Dao is the same. At this stage, all of you are actually one step ahead. To merge the bridges of the five internal organs, you need to have a saturated Super Lock!"
         Their eyes moved.  Li Hao's eyes also lit up. Yuan Shuo continued,""Only when the five organs 'super locks are saturated can they be connected and build the so-called five organs bridge ..."
         Li Hao thought for a moment and frowned,'but in this case, a master in the thousand-fighting stage only has one force. How can he cross this stage? Could it be that I'm going to skip the spirit accumulation stage and enter the spirit fusion stage?"
         Yuan Shuo's thinking was only applicable to some of the top martial masters today.
         But this way, the group of people in the middle would not be able to cross this natural chasm.
         After all, there were not many people who had reached Hong Yitang's level.
         "Don't worry!"Yuan Shuo laughed. There were strong cultivation methods and weak cultivation methods. There were also two ways to build the bridge of the five internal organs. Replacing it with a superpower lock ... This was the method of a powerhouse to achieve it in one go. For the weak ... Don't think about rising to the top in one step. You have to cultivate slowly. The fundamental strength of a Martial Master is still inner strength. The weak should consider using inner strength to build a bridge instead of the Super Lock ... When you succeed in accumulating spirit, you can consider using the Super Lock instead ... Step by step. "
         "Can inner strength build a bridge?"
         Li Hao was still confused."When internal energy enters the internal organs, it's very easy for it to be absorbed by the superpower lock. It can't solidify this bridge."
          "That's easy. "
         "It's fine," Yuan Shuo replied nonchalantly."It's fine as long as it's solidified with divine intent. Momentum and divine intent won't be absorbed by the superpower lock. It'll be fine as long as it's solidified!"
         Li Hao was deep in thought, and so was Hong Yitang.
         After a while, Hong Yitang spoke."According to what you said ... There are actually a few more steps to be done after Qian combat. The first step is to build the bridge of the five internal organs. Then, it's the accumulation of spirit. Next, it's the replacement of the Super Lock. Then, it's the fusion of spirit ..."
         Yuan Shuo nodded."This is the only way for ordinary martial masters to advance. It's not impossible for them to accumulate their spirit directly. However, it's too much of a burden for them!" Our five internal organs can't take it, but that doesn't mean everyone can. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's team didn't build bridges between their five internal organs, but they could still contain their spirit because their five internal organs were powerful. The five internal organs of ordinary Qian duels weren't as powerful as theirs.
         Li Hao thought for a while and said,"teacher, then why do other people have to unlock their four limbs first before they can unlock their five organs?" Only after that can I unseal my power?"
         Yuan Shuo shook his head."I'm not too sure about that. After all, I've never tried it before. However, I'm guessing that it has something to do with the SuperLock itself."
         On the side, Hong Yitang explained,""The saturation of the strength of the limbs is to strengthen the body and nourish the five internal organs. Otherwise, if the five internal organs are directly strengthened, the body will not be able to take it."
        
         "But I ..."
         Li Hao wanted to say that he had strengthened the five organs Super Lock first ... But then he thought about it. His body and bones were actually being strengthened. Otherwise, he might not have been able to strengthen his five organs.
         The few of them continued to discuss.
         At this stage, everyone needed to think clearly about their next step. This was the key.
         A Martial Master who could unseal a seal was a top-notch Martial Master.
         If they were unsealed, their combat power would surpass Xu Guang 's, but they would still be slightly weaker than the sixth level. Unless the power lock was completely broken, when the sixth level appeared and they found a way to stabilize their cultivation ... These top martial masters would probably fall behind.
         The others, including Yuan Shuo, had already reached this stage.
         As for Li Hao, although he had not reached this stage yet, he was almost there.
         If there was no road ahead, it would not be easy to walk.
         ……
          After a few hours of discussion, Yuan Shuo finally said,""The spirit accumulation can be divided into two stages. The first stage is to build the five viscera bridge, and the second stage is to cultivate momentum."
         "Soul Fusion can be divided into two stages. The first stage is the saturated superpower lock. The second stage is when the five locks are connected and fused into the lock."
         He continued,"from the perspective of a force Martial Master, Hong Yitang and the others are only at the first stage of the soul Fusion stage. However, they've already surpassed the level of the rising sun. Therefore, the soul Fusion stage can already rival the two levels above the rising sun." If I enter the second stage ... I might be able to fight against even stronger existences. "
         Hong Yitang laughed."Don't force me into your system!"
         Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes."It's your honor to let you join my system. I'm the only one who can open up a complete path for the martial arts of this era. Your crooked ways will return to the Orthodox one sooner or later!"
         Li Hao didn't care about this. He frowned and said,""If I skip the stage of building the five viscera bridge and don't use inner strength to build it, I can only go through the saturated superpower lock and build it directly?"
         "Why did you jump over?"
         "Is it difficult for you to use your inner strength to build a bridge?" Yuan Shuo said unhappily. Create some trouble for himself? Or do you think that you're talented and that you've reached the heavens in a single bound? Let's fuse the five internal organs into one first, then we can take it slow ... You want to skip it because you think it's not difficult enough, so you want to create some for yourself to show off your talent?"
         “……”
         Li Hao was speechless.
         "I just feel that I've already passed that stage, but after hearing what teacher said ... Alright, it seems to make sense.
         "So, I'll first build the five inner strength bridges to connect the five internal organs and then the Super Lock ..."
         "Dogshit!"  "Have you accumulated spirit?" Yuan Shuo snapped.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was stunned. I've accumulated spirit!
         How could I not have a spirit?
         "Your Shi was forcibly raised. What the hell are you accumulating spirit for!"
         Yuan Shuo was speechless and a little depressed."You've completely relied on external items to improve. This is wrong!" The accumulation of spirit was a process of strengthening the great power. The stronger the power, the stronger the five internal organs! You've relied entirely on external objects to push your way up. You, kid, strictly speaking ... You're not even considered to be in the spirit accumulation stage! You're a force to be reckoned with ... I've only been walking for a few months, and you've completely gone astray!"
         "Accumulating spirit locking force, locking force accumulating spirit ... You're just messing around."
         "Spirit accumulation isn't like what you're doing," he said."It's too difficult to raise your force like this. Something will happen sooner or later!" You haven't even comprehended the true essence of spirit accumulation ... Why did you fuse Shi into your five internal organs? Are you melting it for fun?"
         "You're just playing with it ... It doesn't matter whether you fuse it or not. You've extracted your Shi ... You're still at your current strength, so you're just taking off your pants and farting. You're just playing with it in name."
         Li Hao was dumbfounded!
         It can't be, right?
         He had thought about this problem, but he had always felt that he could raise his force together when he reached the realm of force fusion.
         "Teacher, you mean ..."
          "Take root in the five internal organs!"
         Yuan Shuo frowned and said,"your Shi and your five internal organs are not necessarily connected!" The key to accumulating spirit was to lock the power into the five internal organs. It was not locked for fun, but to improve together. The five internal organs were strong, and the power was strong! Strong power, strong five internal organs!"
         "Force is not without a source. You have to trace the source and find the foundation to root it in the superpower lock. This is also in preparation for the next Soul Fusion. "You have to link your" impose "with your superpower lock before upgrading them together. When your superpower lock is strong, your" impose "will be strong too ..."
         Speaking of this, he glanced at Hong Yitang and was a little dissatisfied.""You've come this far, so it's impossible that you don't understand. I've been gone for a while, and my disciple has been hanging out with you. Didn't anyone remind him?"
         Hong Yitang was really innocent this time. He said helplessly,""How would I know how to walk on the corral divine Dao? is it the same as ours? Li Hao announced to the public that he just needs to fuse it with the five internal organs ... I thought your five birds sect had a special way to increase their force!"
         Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes."I know that this kid made it public. I thought he was deliberately fooling people. So ... He really thinks so?"
         Li Hao was embarrassed.
         That's right, I didn't say anything other than the locking force. Everything else is my true thoughts.
         So ... You all think I'm lying?
         Why do you have such a prejudice against me? at that time, I had just entered the White moon City. I was very weak and timid, so how could I dare to speak blindly?
        
         "Didn't I tell you before I left?"Yuan Shuo had a headache. The name of the realm is spirit accumulation, so why did you take the wrong path? I thought you understood, but you don't understand at all?"
         Li Hao also smiled bitterly."Teacher, when you left, I was only a 100-plus Martial Master. I didn't even know much about force. I only comprehended it by chance. I don't know what you're talking about."
         “……”
         Yuan Shuo sighed. Alright, I've overestimated you.
         "You better sort out your path now!"
         Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice,"if you keep going like this, you can still continue to grow stronger. However, it's all built up. There's always a limit. You can't keep getting treasures to increase your power ... But the strength of your power is the foundation of a Martial master's strength!" "Force isn't just spiritual power, do you understand? "Strictly speaking, force might have replaced the essence of ancient martial arts. Without a way to increase force, you will fall behind sooner or later ..."
         "The Dao of origin has actually disappeared in the later stages of the ancient martial arts. Nowadays, there are actually very few people who can walk the Dao of origin. They are either existences from the ancient civilization or the descendants of the Dao of origin from the ancient civilization ... But if you walk the Dao of origin, you can't surpass your ancestors ... In the end, you will find that there is no way forward."
         "There should have been some changes during the ancient civilization, causing the laws of the world to be different."
         He looked at Li Hao."If you continue down this path, you might be able to reach the origin Dao. Then, you can only follow the path of ancient martial arts for the rest of your life. In the end, you might be able to reach the level of your ancestor ... But the hope is not big. It is almost impossible for you to surpass your ancestor by copying his Dao."
         Li Hao scratched his head."I haven't thought that far yet."
          "Foolish!"
         Yuan Shuo frowned."Even if you can't reach that step, you must still have a high spirit. If you don't even have this bit of spirit, what the hell are you going to cultivate for? why don't you just split the divine weapons? the three of us will each have one ... Later on, we'll think of a way to help you kill Ying Hongyue. You can find a woman and go home to recuperate!"
         Yuan Shuo seemed to be angry.
         Li Hao smiled bitterly."Teacher, that's not what I meant ... Alright, alright, alright. I'll change. I'll change!"
         In front of Yuan Shuo, he seemed to have returned to the past.
         A little white who didn't know anything.
         His previous arrogance and self-confidence had been hit hard.
         However, that was good too.
         Li Hao's understanding of martial arts wasn't very deep, and he lacked many things. Now that Yuan Shuo was helping him correct this, Li Hao, who had grown up uncivilized, might be able to continue moving forward, but it would definitely be half the result with twice the effort.
         Only then did Yuan Shuo nod slightly."It's fine as long as you know your mistakes and correct them! Li Hao, you have to understand that it's only been 20 years since we became supers, but there are already powerhouses at the sixth level. The path of supers is actually very clear. As long as the conflict of the five internal organs is resolved, they will quickly enter the seventh, eighth, and ninth levels!"
         "Of the five internal organs, at least three of the chains can be broken. This means that they've definitely reached the ninth level!"
         "As long as we solve the five internal problems, everything will be smooth ... We might be calling supers trash, but we can't really think so. This is called tactically disdaining, but strategically taking it seriously!"
         "Even someone as powerful as Xu Qing might not be able to match up to someone at the sixth level ... You and I have no right to look down on supers! If we can solve the problem of external superpower and absorb it into our bodies ... At that time, even though the energy system is different, in reality, the path may be the same!"
         "If they can also incorporate superpowers into their bodies ... You have to understand ... The Dao of a Martial Master is actually not as clear as the Dao of superpower!" Yuan Shuo said solemnly.
         Li Hao kept nodding.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com These days, he had been killing and beheading all the supers, but he could not unseal their combat power, so he really did look down on them.
         However, after hearing what his teacher said ... He felt that he had been too careless.
         One must know that there were peak experts in the energy Dao during the ancient civilization. There was even an introduction in the book that the ancient civilization's greatest enemy was the energy Dao. Even in the later stages, it was still a great enemy and had not completely declined.
         But now, the future of a Martial Master was uncertain ... On the other hand, the other party's future was clearer.
         After a series of heavy admonishments, Yuan Shuo's smile suddenly brightened."Alright, I'll sort out the general idea for you. You can do as you see fit for the specific details. Now ... Speed up and continue cultivating. Make more swords ... I haven't absorbed sword energy for a long time! If there's a shortcut, I'll take it first. At least it can save me a lot of time. "
         Li Hao was speechless.
         On the side, Hong Yitang and the radiant sword didn't say a word or leave. They just waited.
         You're so rich now ... Hurry up and don't delay.
         We also want to get some benefits!  Even though Yuan Shuo didn't mention any specific cultivation techniques, there was no need for them to do so. After making sense of the general situation, they had their own goals to achieve.
         Perhaps the final path would be the same, but for now, they did not need to follow Yuan Shuo's instructions completely.
         Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry. However, he had a lot of divine power stones now, so he didn't care about the consumption.
         Soon, he started to break the divine power stones and continued his cultivation.
         The most important thing right now was to build the five bridges, and then follow his teacher's instructions to completely root Shi in the five internal organs, then saturated the superpower lock, and finally fuse Shi into the superpower lock ... He still had a long way to go.
         This time, Li Hao didn't absorb the sword energy. Instead, he let them do as they pleased while he tried to build the five temporary bridges.
         On the side, Black Panther was actually trying as well.
         Black Panther felt that he would not be able to improve very quickly if he relied on his bloodline. Perhaps he could become stronger if he followed humans.
         A large number of divine power stones were broken.
         The few of them had also completely disappeared from the dynasty. Whatever happened in the outside world had nothing to do with them.
         The one who improved the fastest was probably Yuan Shuo.
         He could strengthen his five internal organs, but it would not be as fast as it was now. Since there was a shortcut and he had a clear path, he did not mind taking it. At this moment, he was also absorbing the sword energy rapidly to fill and strengthen his Super Lock.
         At his current stage, he wanted to quickly enter the spirit fusion stage.
         His improvement was fast, but Hong Yitang's side was trying to merge the spirit, merging the sword force into the Super Lock, and building a real bridge between the five internal organs.
         To build the bridge between the five organs, all nine superpower locks had to be saturated.
         Yuan Shuo, who was in the midst of cultivation, seemed to have sensed something and opened his eyes to look at him. Hong Yitang also opened his eyes to look back, and a hint of battle intent gleamed in Yuan Shuo's eyes ... This fellow had truly concealed himself deeply all these years!
         According to his own division, this guy was almost at the second step of God fusion!
         In the first stage, he was definitely no match for this person.
         However, that might not be the case next.
         Hong Yitang smiled and closed his eyes.
         He ignored Yuan Shuo. Yuan Shuo ... Was the source of everyone's improvement. He didn't feel any pressure before, but now he felt a little. If this guy entered the soul Fusion stage quickly, Yuan Shuo, who had Five Forces at the soul Fusion stage, might be able to surpass him very soon.
         As for the radiant sword, it was much simpler. It only needed to absorb sword energy and saturated the superpower lock. She had only saturated two of her five internal organs, and it was still too early.
         ……
          While they were cultivating.
         Near the Eastern Shore.
         Nanquan's face was filled with sorrow. Where was he?
         I rushed here, but I didn't make it in time!
         Oh my God!
         Li Hao has seized so many treasures. Needless to say, he must be cultivating now. I've suffered a great loss!
         Nan Quan was extremely sad.
         He knew that those B * stards must have been cultivating, so he had set out as soon as the news spread. He was too late, and he couldn't find Li Hao and the others no matter what. He knew that he had missed a great opportunity!
         "They must be within a thousand miles of me ... Damn it, it's a pity they didn't reply to me!"
         He could have contacted Tong Yan, but unfortunately, those guys ignored him. How sad!
        
         Everyone had received the communication from the southern Fist.
         Li Hao was busy and didn't have time to deal with it.
         Hong Yitang simply blocked off the southern Fist. 'What's the point of harassing people? you didn't even get to join the battle. Who asked you to not have Southern legs and run so slowly? if you miss it, you can wait for the next time.'
         The stellarsky city was too far away.
         However, it was Nan Quan's fault for running back to the royal family. Hong Yitang didn't sympathize with him. Besides, this guy probably had some benefits waiting for him. Otherwise, why would he run so quickly when he knew that there were benefits for Li Hao?
         At this moment, Li Hao was building five bridges.
         His inner strength was connected, and his divine intent was solidified.
         There was the ancient book "five bridge construction method", which could be used as a reference. He was not without any clues.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yuan Shuo's group didn't seem to be doing it, and Li Hao didn't care either. Just as Yuan Shuo had said, they had a Foundation, while Li Hao's Foundation was poor. He had to move forward step by step. A sudden burst of power not only gave him strength, but it also made him too superficial.
         There were many basic things that he had yet to master.
          Taking everything into account, it had only been three months since he stepped into the tenth severing realm. In these three months, while he had advanced by leaps and bounds, he had also made a lot of mistakes.
         It had only been three years since he started learning the five birds technique.
         Li Hao pondered these things as he built the five bridges.
         The ancient books he had brought back from heaven battling city also echoed in his mind.
         He had memorized it thoroughly, but there were still some things that he didn't quite understand. At this moment, with two top swordsmen and a martial Dao master here, Li Hao didn't forget to ask them a few questions while he was practicing.
         ……
         Time passed in the blink of an eye.
         Three days passed by in a flash.
         He had used up a lot of divine power stones. At that moment, Hong Yitang opened his eyes and said,""I'll head back first, I'm not around at swords gate. There are more people than before, I have to go back and take a look."
         The radiant sword was surprised.
         He left?
         You're not going to cultivate with such a good opportunity?
         In the past few days, the light sword was extremely happy. In three days, she had filled up the third five viscera Super Lock. The speed was extremely fast. This was even better than the results of her previous one to two years of cultivation.
          She wished she could stay here and cultivate until she died.  Why did he just leave?
         As for Li Hao, he had been mainly sorting out the system in the past three days. At this moment, the construction of the five bridges was almost complete. Hearing that Hong Yitang was leaving, Li Hao frowned slightly and said,"If we go back now, will there be any problems? Silver moon's forces are mainly concentrated in white moon City, and swords gate is still quite a distance away from white moon City ..."
         Hong Yitang laughed," They won't attack me rashly, as the losses outweigh the gains. What good will they get by killing me? If you want to kill me, you'll need at least a sixth realm expert, and it's not stable yet. At the current stage, the sixth realm is not very stable. "
         "The breathing technique of five birds might be useful for sixth level superpowers. I can sense it, and those superpowers might be able to sense it as well. I'm afraid you and your disciple will be in trouble."
         "Not only you guys, but also Yuan xingwu and Chen Yuhua!"
         His expression was grave."Even if they are not cultivating the final version of the breathing technique of five birds ... Everyone will be tempted if they know more. You can think about it yourself. I will not participate in the matter of five birds sect."
         At the current stage, many people had not thought of this. Or rather, they did not understand the true mystery of the breathing technique of five birds. Xu Qing had actually seen a lot of things in the last stage.
         It was a pity that he was dead. Otherwise, Xu Qing would have understood that the breathing technique of five birds was extremely crucial.
         Those who practiced the breathing technique of five birds might not understand it.
         In fact, Li Hao didn't quite understand it before, thinking that all breathing techniques were like this. Now, he could understand a little. Putting everything else aside, when he cooperated with his teacher, the connection between their spiritual and spiritual energy felt very mysterious.
         Furthermore, it could be used on an ancient divine weapon, which was even more remarkable!
         After Hong Yitang finished speaking, he looked at Yuan Shuo.""This breathing technique of yours, you've modified a part of it yourself. However, I'm sure the source isn't simple, right?"
          Yuan Shuo glanced at him."What does that have to do with you?"
         “……”
         Hong Yitang cursed in his heart. The old man was asking for a beating. If he kept this attitude, he would be beaten to death sooner or later.
         Of course, it had been a few decades. He would get used to it.
         Yuan Shuo touched his chin and laughed."Of course it's not simple. In fact, the five birds technique is not a secret manual. I combined it with many other secret manuals after consulting them, and they are all top-tier ancient martial arts secret techniques! As for the breathing technique, it's said to have been modified with reference to a secret technique left behind by the ancient Emperor ..."
         He shook his head."The breathing technique of five birds didn't have such magical effects in the first place. However, ever since the rise of superpowers, it has gained some special traits ... Perhaps it has something to do with sword energy. Without a sword, the effect won't be as strong."
         He looked at Li Hao."The combination of the sword and the breathing technique of five birds is the best. Perhaps the secret techniques of the ancient martial arts that I referred to include the techniques of your ancestors." If you use the breathing technique of five birds alone ... It's powerful, but it definitely can't achieve this kind of effect. "
         Li Hao was deep in thought.
         "So ... If it's really spread out, the effect won't be too good unless they can also obtain sword energy."
         After Yuan Shuo said this, he said proudly,"so what if a mediocre person obtained the breathing technique of five birds?" In the end, it was just another secret skill. If it was used well, it would be a top secret skill. If not, it would be ordinary! Do you think that anyone can comprehend the five Forces?"
        
         "It's good that you know what you're doing!"
         Hong Yitang didn't say anything else."Then I'll go back first."
         "As you wish."
         Yuan Shuo was too lazy to care about him, so he was in no hurry to leave.
         Hong Yitang looked at the Sword of Light, but the Sword of Light pretended not to see it. Hong Yitang laughed. "Let's go. There's still a chance later. It's not necessarily a good thing to absorb too much at once. It's better to do it step by step."
         The Sword of Light was helpless!
         This guy, you can go your way.
         However, since he had said so, as a senior Martial Master, she also knew the situation. She could only say,""Then, I ..."
         After thinking about it, she couldn't help but want to curse.
         Why would I go back to Silver Moon?
          I'm over there and I don't have a sect. This guy is crazy to call me!
         However, at this point, he was still not that thick-skinned, so he could only say,""Let's go together. It'll be safer on the way, in case we encounter sixth level powerhouses."
         Seeing that the two of them were about to leave, Li Hao stood up and said,""I still have some spring water of life. It's troublesome to unseal it ... I might not be around, so please take a few drops."
         He originally had 7 drops left, and now he had 9 drops. Now, he had 16 drops.
         He took out two bottles, one containing three drops. If it was a simple unsealing, it should be enough for them to repair themselves. Li Hao didn't need to interfere.
         Hong Yitang glanced at him and laughed. He then looked at Yuan Shuo and took the bottle."If there's anything, find me!"
         The radiant sword did not hold back.
         Silver moon's martial masters were usually not too polite. It was better to have something than nothing. At most, they would come back to fight Li Hao again the next time he fought.
         The two of them each took a bottle and left in the dark without saying a word to Yuan Shuo.
         Yuan Shuo waited for them to leave before he snorted,""You're quite tactful! You're not leaving, are you staying for the new year?"
         Then, he looked at Li Hao."It's good that they're gone. There are some things that I can't tell you too much with them around."
         Li Hao was stunned. What?
         Martial masters were relatively generous, unless it involved their sect's Secret techniques.
         Sure enough, Yuan Shuo said,"I've made some changes to the breathing technique of five birds. The previous breathing technique was mainly an adjustment of the internal strength and qi and blood. While breathing, it strengthened the internal strength and qi and blood. After I stepped into the thousand warrior realm, I made some changes and wanted to integrate the force into it. However, I didn't have time to think about it. I did think about it when I was in the central region ..."  "A few days ago, in the ruins, I made one last adjustment. These three days, after I fused the five Forces, I made some minor adjustments ..."
         Yuan Shuo briefly explained his situation before returning to the main topic,""Breathing techniques are the foundation, the root of power ... What Hong Yitang and I are talking about is a path, a general direction. As for how they will walk it, it's up to them."
         "What I'm going to tell you now is the essence of the breathing technique, which is also the essence of a warrior. The reason why power can be absorbed into the body and give birth to power is all thanks to the breathing technique."
         "Remember, breathing techniques are the foundation ... Li Hao, everything on the outside is a technique! Superpowers, martial arts, fighting techniques, combat mantra...These are all techniques, and techniques are the root!"
         "If a Martial Master is a tree, then a breathing technique is the sun, water, and soil. It seems that without these, a tree is still a tree ... But it will wither sooner or later. Only with the technique can it continue to grow!"
         Li Hao understood. He nodded."I understand what you mean, teacher. Then, the breathing technique of five birds this time ... Can it strengthen its power?"
         "Right!"
         "That's why Hong Yitang said that it's fine if someone has designs on your two disappointing senior brothers and senior sisters!"Yuan Shuo laughed. "Their version is actually relatively old. It's a version from many years ago. It's not even as profound as the one you're cultivating now."
         "Times keep up with the times. Even if the old version is thrown out, what can it do?"
         "In fact, you and I who have read ancient books should understand that treasuring one's own belongings is not the direction of martial Dao's advancement ... But in this era ..."
         Yuan Shuo laughed coldly,"in this era, you're just looking for death if you don't treasure your own belongings!" "Even if I wanted to spread it, it wouldn't be now, and it definitely wouldn't be when those fellows haven't even started to stabilize their realms and are just finding trouble for themselves. I'm even regretting it now. Back then, I wasn't paying too much attention when I was researching something, and I've already spread it ..."
         Li Hao nodded.
         At this moment, he was a little excited."Teacher, will my five powers increase greatly after I cultivate this version of the five birds breathing technique?" he asked.
          "What are you thinking?"
         Yuan Shuo was speechless."It's just to make it easier for you to merge the five powers. It's true that laws are the root, but laws are not natural treasures that can make rapid progress. This is the foundation of cultivation step by step!" All treasures will eventually run out. Only techniques are the roots that will always exist!"
         Li Hao thought of something and nodded.
         After that, Yuan Shuo did not speak anymore. Instead, he transmitted his voice and began to teach the new version. Not only that, he even used the secret language unique to five birds sect to teach.
         Obviously, Yuan Shuo still valued these things. He didn't want the latest version of the breathing technique of five birds to be circulated.
         At the side, Black Panther's ears were almost perking up to the sky.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Unfortunately, he couldn't hear her.
         Heibao was very anxious!
         Yuan Shuo saw it, but he couldn't be bothered with it. If the sword could be eaten by this dog, then so be it. But techniques couldn't be passed on randomly. After all, this dog was a demon. If it ran away one day, it would easily cause trouble.
         All treasures were external objects, only techniques were the source of one's power.
        
         Li Hao listened in silence.
         He silently experienced it and comprehended it.
         The new breathing technique of five birds felt much more complicated and involved more things than before. Before, it only involved a few simple aspects such as inner strength, breathing frequency, and the flow of qi and blood.
         The technique this time involved the operation of some Shi.
         When it came to this, the difficulty was greatly increased.
         Moreover, it had to be said that his teacher was indeed knowledgeable and advanced with the times. He did not just stick to one set of techniques and eat his old capital. Instead, he was constantly improving. As his strength increased, he was also constantly refining it.
         Among the Silver Moon martial masters, Yuan Shuo was considered the older one. He was already in his seventies, while many of the martial masters were only in their early fifties.
         He was not young, but his talent had always been good. However, he had been the worst in the end ... It was also because Yuan Shuo had wasted a lot of time on these things. He had learned too many things.
         He had spent many years on just the fusion of the five Forces.
         Long before he had dominated the martial arts world, some of his peers had actually entered the Qian warrior realm. Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, could only be considered as an invincible existence in his own realm.
          However, it was also because of his persistence and perseverance that he had broken through to the warrior of thousands and improved at a lightning speed. Even someone like Li Hao, who could drink swords like plain water, could not catch up to Yuan Shuo.
         This was the benefit of his fusion of the five powers.
         The master and disciple talked about the new version of the five birds breathing technique. Li Hao also began to change it. Li Hao only used the new version for a while before he felt it. The sword energy surged in at a faster speed.
         This was only the basic effect.
         More importantly, when he circulated it, his five internal organs seemed to be wrapped in a special energy that guided the Shi in his five internal organs, making him feel as if he was connected to his entire body.
         He gathered all the power in his body.
         "Teacher, why do I feel like there's a hint of the bloody blade art in it?" Li Hao was a little surprised.
         Yuan Shuo laughed,"you felt it?" That's right, the new version was actually based on the bloody blade technique! The art of the bloody blade was the fusion of essence, Qi, and spirit. However, the art of the bloody blade was a self-mutilating and explosive technique that directly extracted everything! I've made some improvements and incorporated it into the breathing technique of five birds. The effect is not as good as the blood saber technique, but it won't harm the body. Instead, it can nourish the body. "
         Li Hao was impressed. His teacher had integrated these ancient martial arts into his body so easily.
         The bloody blade art was indeed too harmful to the body.
         ? If not for sword energy, Li Hao would not have dared to use it.
         Now that his teacher had integrated it into his breathing technique, it was no wonder that he could draw in all the power in his body. Even Shi was drawn in. This was very awesome.
         Li Hao memorized this and tried to activate it himself.
         Immediately after, Yuan Shuo considered for a while and said,""I've offended too many people, so sometimes it's not good for me to say much. You and those old fellows are not bad ... If you have time, you can borrow their secret techniques to take a look. If you have enough patience, you can try to fuse these secret techniques ... Let's not talk about other things. You know the ninth-form force, so you can try to fuse it with the five birds breathing technique. Li Hao, anything can happen in a person's life. "  He sighed."I've been modifying the breathing technique until now. I'm afraid I won't be releasing the next version in a short time ... As for you, you may go further, but ancient martial arts doesn't match us. You have to walk your own path in the future ... Learn more and accumulate more. In the future, try to modify it yourself."
         "As for the general direction, it's nothing more than the Super Lock, force, qi and blood, and the physical body. The explosive power of the nine refinements is not out of thin air, but something that comes with it. The nine refinements is actually a way to stimulate one's potential and a way to use one's strength. I've always felt that it's very suitable to be integrated into the five birds technique."
         Li Hao wanted to say something but stopped.
         A moment later, he nodded.
         Suddenly, he felt a little pressured. 'I'm just a half-baked Martial Master. Can I even incorporate a new technique into it?'
         He felt that it was very, very difficult.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This required the accumulation of a large amount of knowledge and experience, which he actually did not have.
         However, he understood the meaning behind his teacher's words.
         Li Hao's progress was not slow, or rather, it was faster than his.
         At this rate, Yuan Shuo wouldn't be able to experience that feeling until he reached that level. The technique he created out of thin air wouldn't be suitable for Li Hao. At this point, he could only rely on himself if he wanted to advance.
         Yuan Shuo patted Li Hao's shoulder and smiled."You don't have to feel too much pressure. Some things can be said to be very difficult, but they can be said to be simple. In fact, it's just a matter of time!" The more knowledge one had, the easier it was to understand, comprehend, and master. He didn't have to go into seclusion and memorize everything. Reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand li are actually all DAOs. "
         "En!"
         Li Hao nodded and smiled."Don't worry, teacher. I know what to do. I'll first imitate you, then catch up, and then surpass you. So, I'll first imitate you, teacher, catch up, and then surpass you!"
          Yuan Shuo's smile was a little stiff as he nodded,""Well said!"
         As he said that, he was cursing in his heart!
         That was impossible!
         'I won't give you the chance, but I'll be one step ahead of you.' Those words might sound very satisfying, but as a teacher ... How could he be willing to accept it?
         Yuan Shuo did not continue on this topic and said,""Also, I'll absorb some more sword energy before leaving ..."
         "What?"
         Li Hao was startled."Teacher, you're leaving?"
         Why?
         "Of course!"
         Yuan Shuo laughed,"there's no banquet that doesn't end!" Experts are all alone and lonely ... Look at Tian Jian and the others, are they all gathered together? Huang Yu and the others are always together, but they won't always be like this. If you want to break through, if you want to go further ... You should have your own world!"
        
         "This world is still very exciting!"
         Yuan Shuo chuckled,"fighting against the heavens, the earth, the people, the ancient people ... These are all very exciting!" If you had followed me, would you have been able to make it this far? Similarly, if I continue to follow you, I will also lose my own soul. "
         "Although the sword energy is good, it's not all!"
         He looked at Li Hao."You have to remember this as well. The sword is good, but you can't always rely on it. If one day, you don't have a sword, will you stop cultivating?"
         Li Hao nodded again and exhaled.""I've remembered everything teacher said!"
         At this point, he hesitated for a moment before he said,""Teacher, senior uncle Hong said that this era is abnormal. He wants to change, but he can't do anything. He wants to do something, but there are obstacles everywhere. Teacher, do you think ... What he said makes sense?"
         Yuan Shuo frowned slightly.
         After a moment, he said,"that's true, but remember, everyone's path is different!" Whether it was overbearing, kingly, killing, or demonic ... It didn't have to be exactly the same! Hong Yitang's location is vast and is compatible with me. I'm not suitable for this path because I'm suitable for my own path. What is your own Dao? You're still young, so you should walk around more and see more. Don't be affected by them. They want to force their own insights on you, which is not suitable!"
         "When you travel the world and observe the myriad flavors of life, you will experience the peak, the glory, the decline, and the low tide ... Only then will you be able to think about what you are suitable for."
          Yuan Shuo patted his disciple again and said with a smile,""You have to stick to your own ideas ... At this stage, there is only one thing you need to do, revenge! They think you will be blinded by hatred, but I don't think you will! "Revenge is one of your beliefs right now ... Don't break this belief. When you left Silver Moon and went to the East, I actually understood that you were actually thinking about something. You didn't want to stay in Silver Moon and bring trouble to others ... That's the right thing to do. "
         "It's our own business, we'll solve it ourselves! I could've escaped Silver City, but I'm sure I'd bring a lot of trouble and trouble to some people ... Like hou Xiaochen and the others. I can't leave, but you have to!"
         As he talked about his past, he laughed and shook his head."Ten years ago, I could have escaped ... But I still stayed in the Silver City. Do you know why?"
         Li Hao shook his head.
         "That's because the price I have to pay to escape is very high ... It's not me, but Silver Moon who will have to pay a huge price for this ... Your teacher has been through ups and downs for so many years, so how could I not have a backup plan?"
         He sighed,"for example ... We can dig out an old antique and turn the world upside down!" Sometimes, people can't think too much. They have to consider some things and the consequences. "
         Li Hao's pupils shrank."Teacher, you mean?"
         "Didn't you already encounter it?"
         Yuan Shuo laughed."Even you can dig out monster plants. The world is so big. Do you think there are only one place where ancient creatures exist?" But you have to remember that times have changed. Be careful not to let the Tiger out of the cage. In any era, there are good and bad people!"
         He didn't go into detail and only reminded her,""Whether it's heaven battling city or the monster plants you've dug up, you can communicate and cooperate ... But you can't lose yourself! You are Li Hao, as for your identity as the successor of the eight great families ... Just throw it away!"
         "The responsibility of the eight great families, the glory of the eight great families, everything of the eight great families ... None of it has anything to do with you!"
         Li Hao kept breathing. After a long time, he nodded again."Understood!"
         Yuan Shuo laughed. It was good that he understood.  Live to be yourself!
         He didn't want his disciple to live in someone else's shadow. In the end, would Li Hao still be the one living?
         Whether he was strong or weak, it was best to live his own life.
         ……
         Ever since Yuan Shuo had taught them the new breathing technique of five birds, the master and disciple had not communicated much.
         Instead, he focused on absorbing the sword energy.
         Yuan Shuo didn't have the mood to disturb Li Hao and correct him too much. This had always been the case with his disciples. He had said it a few times. If you understand, then so be it. If you don 't, then forget it. He didn't expect you to be like him.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had spent five days to finally build the simple five bridges.
         The moment it was built, he felt something different.
         The five internal organs had formed a cycle. If he strengthened the five internal organs again, it would probably not be as troublesome as before.
         Li Hao still had one more thing to do.
         The five Forces were rooted in the five internal organs.
          With this, he could be considered to have completed the basic cultivation of accumulating spirit. Next, what he needed to do was to merge the five powers.
         Five days was perhaps the longest Li Hao had ever trained.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com ,m At this moment, he had forgotten everything in the outside world.  As for Yuan Shuo, he didn't rest or sleep. He was constantly absorbing sword energy. He would be letting himself down if he didn't replenish his energy and eat a big meal while his disciple was still by his side.
         Master and disciple plus a dog had also consumed a lot of energy.
         In addition, Hong Yitang and the others were there a few days ago. In just a few days, they had consumed a total of 50000 divine power stones.
         This kind of consumption could make a small force go bankrupt and close down.
         However, the greater the consumption, the greater the harvest.
         On the sixth day, Li Hao tried to integrate wood sword force into his five internal organs first. Wood sword force corresponded to his liver.
