        t until they were far away from the square where the dead man was found that they returned to the alley and calmed down.
         Li Hao let out a breath.
         This ancient city was filled with danger.
         They didn't dare to enter the shops on both sides of the street. Li Hao wanted to go in at first, but he and Liu Long felt a sense of danger at the same time. It was the instinctive sense of danger that martial masters had.
         Therefore, the two of them didn't dare to enter and ran back to the alley.
         They didn't know what kind of danger was in that room. Could it be that there was also a Black Phoenix?
         No matter what, he couldn't stay in that place.
         Looking at the energy storage box in his hand, Li Hao considered for a moment, then looked at Liu Long and the other man.""Boss, sister, help me guard the two ends. I want to cultivate for a while."
         "Now?"
         Liu Long frowned slightly. It was not a good time to cultivate here.
          As for Li Hao's training, it wasn't a problem for them to guard the door.
         After he had entered the warrior of thousands, the mysterious energy alone was not of much help.
         For example, Yuan Shuo didn't care much about the mysterious energy at first. It was only when Li Hao could purify it and extract the five elements that he could use to strengthen his five organs that it was of great help to him.
         It was the same for Liu Long, so he didn't want to share the mysterious energy that Li Hao seized.
         As for Liu Yan, she naturally wouldn't say anything.
         She knew that Li Hao had a special energy that was very helpful to martial masters.
         At this juncture, Li Hao's cultivation might be able to advance to the Qian dynasty. If that were the case, it would be beneficial to everyone.
         "Now!"
         Li Hao nodded."Some of the superpowers from the small organizations have escaped. They will definitely encounter the people behind them and will probably move together. In this case, Black Phoenix may not be able to stop them if they have more people. We don't dare to go to the inner city, so we will meet them sooner or later ... So, I'll take this opportunity to see if I can enter the thousand-man combat."
         Liu Long said no more and quickly walked to the alley in the direction of the inner city. He then silently crouched down.
         Their main objective here was to prevent hei Teng from entering.
         As for Liu Yan, she had also gone to the other side.
         Li Hao took a deep breath and decided to seize the last opportunity. There wasn't much sword energy left. In the end, his teacher chose to absorb the power of the red shadow instead of the sword energy. Clearly, he was saving a little sword energy for him.
         They probably hoped that he could take the opportunity to enter the thousand warrior realm.
         Li Hao had now mastered two types of force.
         However, none of them were too powerful. They were only the initial form of Shi. However, if he could fuse two types of Shi, he might be able to strengthen the two types of Shi and step into the Qian Douluo realm.
         The fusion ...
          The sword and the earth actually didn't have any opportunity to merge.  However, his teacher could even fuse the force of five birds. It was clear that the fusion of force also required some talent and skill.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com According to his teacher, any potential had some common points. When you found the common point, you could magnify it and start from it. Then, you would have a chance to fuse with the potential.
         It was very simple, but also very difficult.
         Li Hao's top priority was not to fuse force, but to strengthen his five internal organs.
         Merging force and advancing to thousand warrior tier would depend on the situation.
         Strengthening the five internal organs was the real way to build a foundation. When he entered the warrior Qian stage, he could quickly choose the five internal organs to contain the spirit instead of grinding it slowly. He had to strengthen the five internal organs to the point that when the spirit was contained, it would not cause the other four internal organs to break.
         Before the five birds breathing technique was revised, apart from Yuan Shuo, the only people who could contain their spirit without breaking their five internal organs were probably some old martial masters who had been in the warrior dimension for decades.
         These old martial masters had been in the warrior dimension for dozens of years. If they couldn't find the way, they would subconsciously strengthen their five internal organs. Being strong both inside and outside was also one of the goals of martial masters.
         For a newbie Martial Master like Li Hao, without elemental strengthening, it would be extremely difficult to strengthen his five internal organs.
         He reached into the energy storage box and took out a human bone.
         There was also some blood mixed in. Li Hao had calmed down a long time ago. He sensed it and determined that it was fire energy, which was quite common.
         The heart of the strong five organs!
         He activated the breathing technique of five birds, and some sword energy slowly seeped out of the small sword at his waist.
         Compared to before ... Li Hao could only say that he didn't know how expensive a sword could be when he was young. Back then, he had squandered it, and even Gou 'Zi had used a lot. Now, when he felt this weak sword energy flowing over, he could only secretly regret it.
         Fortunately, even if it was slower, the sword could still strip away the mysterious energy.
         The fire elemental energy was quickly stripped away.
          The non-elemental energy that was extracted strengthened his body, while the fire elemental energy started to strengthen his heart.
         This bone belonged to one of the moon nether superpowers, but it did not contain much mysterious energy. After a while, the mysterious energy was absorbed.
         Li Hao continued.
         It was said that some organizations 'secret places and ruins would have mysterious energy. Some origin God weapons could also be born on their own or through some means. The mysterious energy contained in the human body was actually of the lowest quality and the lowest cost-performance ratio.
         Unfortunately, the current Li Hao could only obtain it through such means, mainly because he had consumed too much.
         In order to strengthen his five internal organs and nurture the heart fire ape, Yuan Shuo had directly absorbed 1000 cubic meters of fire energy.
         Li Hao wanted to reach Yuan Shuo's level ... Even if it was slightly weaker. Previously, his five internal organs had only absorbed about 200 cubic meters of each type of energy of the five elements. Now, he would need to absorb at least 800 cubic meters of each type of energy to safely store his spirit.
         Of course, it was very difficult to strengthen all five organs, so he could prioritize strengthening one.
         Li Hao didn't care.
         He would absorb as much as he could.
        
         At this moment, he was not picky and could absorb any kind of energy.
         This included wind energy, which allowed him to be light.
         Lightning energy could strengthen one's body.
         All of these could be absorbed.
         The key was that he didn't have enough sword energy. He didn't know if he would be able to find another opportunity to replenish his sword energy in this ancient city. After all, this ancient city did seem to have some connection with the eight great families.
         One minute, five minutes ... Ten minutes ...
         This continued for half an hour, and in the distance, a series of rumbles could be heard.
         A moment later, Liu Long quickly returned with a serious expression,""Hurry up and finish your cultivation. A group of at least a hundred hei Teng disappeared outside. They must have gone to stop those people. Also, it's not just hei Teng ... I saw a person in this group that might be at the level of a Centurion. His armor is bronze!"
         After hei Teng, soldiers in bronze armor appeared.
         If hei Teng's strength was around the Dark Moon realm, what about Tong Yan?
          Sunlight?
         These soldiers had great teamwork and were immortal. How strong was a bronze armor at the sun glory realm?
         The black Phoenix had killed many sunlit cultivators.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Could it be that this time, the copper pan could deal with the three suns?
         Li Hao's expression was somewhat grave. He quickly stopped absorbing. In fact, there wasn't much left. The harvest this time was still acceptable.
         In total, he had absorbed about 800 cubic meters of mysterious energy, which was enough to make Li Hao nervous.
         However, the five elements were not balanced. The fire energy was more, at least 300 cubic meters.
         As for the other five elements, he did not manage to absorb water, but he did absorb metal, wood, and earth. As a result, Li Hao's kidney was obviously in a worse condition than the other four organs.
         "Let's go and take a look!"
         Li Hao stood up and the two of them quickly gathered with Liu Yan.
         At this moment, Liu Yan's voice was very low and somewhat solemn.""Be careful, there was something wrong with this Street just now ..."
         Something's wrong?
         At this moment, this place was very dark. Did he see the copper miasma?
         While Li Hao was thinking, Liu Yan said in a deep voice,""Just now ... I don't know if it was because of the battle ahead, but an Earth Power sneaked in from that side. Black Phoenix was patrolling, and the guy hid in the house. Then, there was a scream, and then there was no movement!"
         It was obvious that some of them had thought that they would be the first to explore the area while the others were fighting hei Teng. In the end, they had seen hei Teng patrolling the area and had hidden in a house, immediately encountering danger.
         He was dead!
         Li Hao and the other two looked at the houses on both sides of the alley. At this moment, they looked particularly gloomy.
         The flag was still fluttering in the wind, but none of them had any intention of entering the house.
         BOOM!
         Just as he was thinking about it, a rumbling sound came from the other side of the street again. This time, the movement was much greater than before. It was obvious that a powerful expert had made a move.
         This time, there were many three-sun strong practitioners.  No matter how strong hei Teng was, he was only at the level of a Dark Moon.
         With the three suns around, hei Teng couldn't do anything, even if he was immortal. The gap between the two sides was too big.
         The explosions continued, and Li Hao and the others even heard the shouts of experts."These black-armored men are strong because of their armor. Their power comes from the ground. The ground is covered with a layer of rocks to isolate the source of power!"
         Li Hao didn't know how the battle was going on.
         At this moment, Li Hao took a deep breath.
         Who was this?
         Amazing!
         Only then did Li Hao realize why the black Phoenix never left the ground. Also, Li Hao knew that the ground was special, but he didn't expect this expert to see through it so quickly.
         The black Phoenix's power came from underground!
         In other words, the ground had given the black flames energy, which was why the black armors were immortal and could maintain their combat strength.
         "Hei Teng ... So, as long as we don't let these soldiers land on the ground, we'll be able to get rid of them?" Liu Long's eyes flickered.
         Li Hao frowned."It might not be a good thing. After we get rid of these soldiers, these guys will encounter us soon!"
         He didn't know why they had appeared in front of them, but the night patrolman was behind them.
         According to the order, the ones who arrived earlier were probably from swords gate and Yama.
         Swords gate couldn't really say anything, but Yama ... They were definitely not on the same side.
         "Let's go and take a look!"
         Li Hao decided to observe for a while longer.
         The one who shouted earlier might have been a Yama expert. It didn't sound like the voice of the Samsara King. It might have been another three suns expert. The one who didn't speak much before had a good eye.
         ……
         When Li Hao and the others sneaked over again, a great battle was about to break out.
          They were indeed experts from both the Yama and swords gate.
         From Li Hao's observation, there were two three suns in swords gate. Other than Hong Yitang, there was also a woman. Was she Hong Yitang's wife, mistress, or disciple?
         Who cares? Li Hao didn't care too much.
         The two sides were now in a joint state. There were a total of four three suns experts, including an existence at the peak of three suns like the Yama reincarnation King.
         At this moment, the three suns didn't make a move ... No, the metal element expert of the Yama made a move.
         He was currently fighting with the copper-armored being that Liu Long had mentioned.
         The other three suns were still observing.
         As for hei Teng, many of them had fallen to the ground, and some of them had been suppressed by the earth element experts!
         Li Hao saw that Tiger soul, or li Dahu, punched out with the force of Mount Tai. He directly suppressed and sealed a Black Phoenix in a mountain of earth, isolating him.
         As a result, the black Phoenix, which was struggling at first, gradually stopped moving.
        
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. Big organizations were completely different.
         There were quite a number of sunlit members in the small organizations before, but they were completely suppressed by the black Phoenix. However, these guys did not actually have many powerhouses, but they quickly broke through the joint formation of hundreds of Black Phoenix.
         One by one, the black Phoenix was suppressed.
         Soon, they were either sealed or isolated from the ground. Gradually, their power began to weaken.
         The two large organizations, together with the members of the small organizations who had escaped earlier, had about seventy to eighty people, not much less than the black Phoenix. With the three suns holding the fort, the battle was almost one-sided.
         The Dark Moon black hou were gradually suppressed to the point where they couldn't even raise their heads. In the blink of an eye, only a dozen black hou and the copper hou were still fighting.
         But this time, swords gate and Yama only lost a dozen of their men, which was much stronger than the previous battles.
         Li Hao and the other two didn't dare to breathe.
         Fortunately, he was a Martial Master. Otherwise, they would not have dared to peek at him at such a close distance.
         Strong!
          This time, the three of them finally witnessed the power of the large organizations.
         The three suns of the metal element had been suppressing the bronze armor. Although the bronze armor only had the power of the sun glory, it was invincible with its armor. As for the other earth element seals, they were all shattered instantly, so it was difficult to seal the bronze armor.
         At this moment, behind them, the Samsara King frowned.""It's only at the mid-stage of the sun glory realm, but it's hard to be hurt by swords and sabers. Even the three suns can't break this armor ... This armor is also a transcendent-level treasure!"
         If they could take away the armors, they would not suffer a loss this time. They would profit!
         The black armor of the hundreds of them was also extraordinary.
         If he took it out, he could even cultivate a powerful team, but he felt that it might be more suitable for martial masters!
         Martial masters didn't have any superpower fluctuations, and this armor seemed to have some effect of concealing their aura. In addition to their powerful physical fitness ... If these black armors were used by martial masters ...
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The cycle King thought.
         Because of Yuan Shuo, martial masters were on the rise. The large organizations had not given up on the cultivation of martial masters, mainly to cultivate superpowers for future employment.
         However, what if all martial masters were equipped with this armor?
         The armor's defense against superpower was very strong!
         As long as the martial masters inside were not killed, a hundred martial masters might be able to fight sunlight.
         As he spoke, he reached out and grabbed a black-armored soldier.
         The power of the peak of the three suns could be seen.
         He held it in his hand and allowed the black-armored soldier to struggle for a while. Gradually, the soldier lost his motivation.
         He observed carefully and frowned slightly.""It's ... Not a human inside?"
         It didn't seem to be a human!
          He didn't know what it was exactly. At this moment, it wasn't a good time for him to open the black banner, but it wasn't impossible to open it by force. With his strength, this was only a soldier's armor at the level of a Dark Moon. It couldn't block his attack.  However, this was a treasure ... Wasn't the purpose of exploring the ruins for treasures?
         When the black-armored soldier lost his connection with the earth, his armor gradually became light, as if it had lost its support.
         At this moment, Hong Yitang spoke."King of Samsara, open one of them and take a look. Check out what kind of structure it has to be able to keep these things here!"
         The king of Samsara thought for a moment and nodded.
         A wind blade appeared in his hand.
         The powerful wind blade, which was at the peak of the three yang realm, was able to cut the black banner open with one strike.
         With Yue Ming and sunlight unable to damage it, he easily cut open the armor.
         At this moment, not only them, but Li Hao and the others were also staring at it from a distance ... Although they couldn't see it clearly, they were also very curious about what was inside the armor.
         "What?"
         At this moment, a bewildered voice came from the other side.
         Hong Yitang's voice also carried some shock.""Bones?"
         Li Hao and the others were shocked.
         Bones?
         Was there really someone inside?
         The reincarnation King was also surprised.""They're ... Really soldiers! However, they are dead soldiers. This ... This city used to use these armors and martial masters as soldiers?"
         It was too unbelievable!
          At this moment, he opened the armor, and there was really someone inside ... But it was a decayed skeleton. The moment he opened the armor, the bones had already turned into powder with the wind.
         He instantly disappeared!
         The reason the bones were preserved was because of the sealing effect of the armor.
         At this moment, when the armor was opened, the bones were instantly crushed.
         However, the reincarnation King studied the armor and glanced at Hong Yitang. Hong Yitang's eyes flickered and he quickly said,""If the Yama wants these, they will naturally belong to him ... However, if there are any more treasures, as an organization, swords gate can't just leave them empty-handed. What do you think, reincarnation King?"
         Obviously, he knew that the reincarnation King had taken a fancy to these armors.
         Although it had lost the support of the special terrain here and seemed unable to continuously replenish its energy, just the structure and toughness of the armor alone were already extremely powerful treasures.
         If they could replicate it and create an Army of martial masters ... It was simply unimaginable.
         "Alright, thank you, sword head Hong!"
         The reincarnation King smiled. Although the other party wanted it, he did not want to give it to them. However, they were three suns and many sunlit Warriors. At this moment, they were facing a crisis in the ancient city. It was not good to fall out with them.
        
         Hou Xiaochen was right. When they saw the danger involved, it would be hard for them to have any thoughts of killing each other.
         Just this 100-man armored team before them had caused them to lose many people.
         With the two organizations working together, more than ten of them had died. However, about twenty of the unaffiliated cultivators had died. In just a short while, more than thirty supers had died.
         This time, there were only about 200 superpowers.
         This was only the shallow layer, and they had lost one-sixth of their forces. Although most of the people who died were Yue Ming and a few sunlit ones, they were all elites on the outside!
         This time, the top powers of the entire Silver Moon superpower realm were here to explore the ruins.
         It was naturally for the best that Hong Yitang was tactful.
         "Yaocheng, quickly finish off this bronze-armored soldier!"
         Yao Cheng, the three suns expert of Yama.
         Upon hearing the reincarnation King's words, he hurriedly said,""My Lord, I just can't bear to ... Destroy this armor!"
          The bronze one was even stronger!
         It wasn't that he couldn't take him down, but he was indeed a little reluctant.
         He was of the metal element and was best at attacking. He could still take down a bronze-armored warrior at the middle stage of the sun glory realm, but what if he broke the armor and couldn't repair it?
         "That's true ..."
         The reincarnation King thought about it and was also reluctant.
         Metal element powers were not good at anything else. In his opinion, it was useless.
         Of course, he did not say it out loud.
         In the next moment, a hurricane swept out. The bronze-armored soldier had been fighting the entire time, as if he did not know fatigue. However, as the hurricane swept out, it instantly lifted the armored soldier into the air.
         The wind instantly turned into chains and locked the bronze-armored warrior in the blink of an eye!
         It was fixed in mid-air.
         This move didn't cause any attacks from the sky. Obviously, the attacks from the sky wouldn't attack these armored soldiers.
         The bronze-armored soldier kept struggling!
         It was of no use.
         The Samsara King was an existence at the peak of the three suns realm. He even had an origin divine weapon and stood at the peak of Silver Moon.
         A mere Centurion in bronze armor could not do anything to him.
         After leaving the earth, the energy seemed to have lost its source. Gradually, the bronze armor's struggle began to weaken.
         Just as the reincarnation King felt that the problem had been solved.
         The next moment, the bronze armored soldier suddenly burst into light and exploded!
         "What?"  The reincarnation King's expression changed. It exploded?
         Self-destruction?
         How was that possible?
         From his point of view, these soldiers were only acting according to the instincts of the ancient civilization. They had been dead for countless years and did not have any intelligence. They were only given orders to follow the military orders from back then to kill the invaders.
         But now, he had been captured, and his source of power had been cut off ... How could he self-destruct?
         Moreover, the powerful armor had actually exploded into pieces!
         Why was this so?
         Unless the soldiers did not self-destruct, but the armor itself had some special ability. For example, if the energy was not replenished, it would self-destruct.
         He hurriedly observed the black banners. Seeing that they were safe and sound, he heaved a sigh of relief.
         He frowned slightly."Bronze armor. Perhaps it's a high-grade armor. That's why the ancient city's owner didn't want the bronze armor to be leaked out. It would self-destruct if it lost its energy supply." The black Phoenix should have only been a standard equipment back then, so there was no such command. "
         He still had some foresight, and he quickly determined the reason for the self-destruction.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This time, it was a bit of a pity.
         In that case, he could only bring some black daggers back this time. As for the bronze daggers ... He didn't know if he could cancel the order. He might need to enter the inner city to do that.
         "My Lord," the metal-Elemental Expert Yao Cheng said,"the night patrollers have explored this place many times. Do they also have some black flames?" I've never revealed this before. "
         Night patrollers, are there?
         The night patrolmen could enter several times, so it was impossible for them to not find anything.
         There might be!
         Perhaps the night patrolman had already secretly trained a group of martial masters to wear this armor. If that was the case ... The night patrolman had hidden himself quite well.
          They had only come in once. If they were to retreat now and wait for the door to open at night, they could take away hundreds of Black Phoenix.
         Although the night patrollers were not too strong, they were not weak either. If they came again and again, even if they only came once a month, it would have been three years since they discovered the remains.
         36 times!
         Even if he didn't get such a harvest every time, if he wasn't too greedy, he might have gotten thousands of black puppets.
         Thinking of this, they were a little shocked.
         Would it be like this?
         If that was the case ... The night watchman had hidden himself too deeply. Even if there were not enough martial masters to wear them, three years was enough to train a group of martial masters.
         The king of Samsara didn't say anything. Instead, he recalled and said,""I'm not sure about the Silver Moon branch of the Nightwatchers ... But ... These black armors do remind me of something. I heard that there's an Imperial Guard in the central region, and they're all heavy-armored martial masters! Back when the world was under peace, this heavy-armored Imperial Guard army appeared and swept through everything. Do you think the star royal family discovered such a ruin back then?"
         At this moment, he thought of the imperial family.
         Back then, the star royal family rose quickly and formed an Army. The most important part was the royal guards. They were extremely powerful. In that era before the rise of superpowers, their martial masters were almost invincible when they wore heavy armor!
        
         Could it be that ... This ancient city was not the only one?
         Of course, if that was the case, it also showed the importance of this ancient city. They didn't know how many more black flames were inside, but if there were many, they could slowly grind them down.
         Perhaps, they could also create an Army.
         What a terrifying existence!
         "I don't care anymore. I'll take these black flames and continue moving forward ..."
         "Milord, do we still proceed?"
         Someone asked.
         He had already gained a lot. If he continued, would he encounter more black phoenixes?
         After all, they didn't have many people.
         The king of Samsara thought for a moment."Yaocheng, take some people with you to investigate. We'll wait for Hong Yue and the others here. Although we'll gain more if we go in first, it'll be more dangerous and we'll have to pay a higher price. Many people have died. We've lost too much strength after a few trips ... You should send some people to explore the way first!"
          At the very least, he had to grasp some information.
         "Be careful," he reminded again."Try not to fluctuate your superpowers. Don't make any sound or light. Otherwise, you'll attract the attention of the black Phoenix." Finally, don't fly, that's the most dangerous part!"
         The metal element Three suns hesitated, but they quickly accepted the order.
         Be it hei Yao or Tong Yan, they couldn't hurt him for the time being, and the danger wasn't that great. Don't run around, just rush into the inner city.
         Soon, he waved his hand and led seven or eight experts into the depths of the street. They were careful not to let the mysterious energy leak out too much, in case it caused a larger scale encirclement.
         As for Hong Yitang, he also whispered a few words and some of the swords gate disciples also walked out.
         Some of the surviving individual cultivators 'eyes flickered. Very quickly, a few more people charged out. The two large organizations did not stop them. It was a job to Scout the way. It was even better if these people were willing to take the risk.
         If these people had not come back to report the news, they would have rashly flown into the sky, and this time, many more people would have died.
         Therefore, these individual cultivators were still useful at times.
         As for getting some benefits ... So what?
         No matter how great an individual's harvest was, it couldn't be compared to large organizations like theirs. For example, this time, the Yama had easily obtained over a hundred black skeletons.
         Of course, the reincarnation King was not stupid.
         He quickly led the black Phoenix and the rest of the people out of the square.
         Once he entered this area, it was possible that more black puppets would come. Although he was not afraid, he did not know how many there were. If he could not kill them all, wouldn't he be worn out bit by bit?
         The street became quiet again.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But this time, there were more shadows. In the dark, more than 20 people from both sides and the Rogue cultivators entered the street.
         Among them, there was a three-sun powerhouse.  ,m ……  At this moment, Li Hao's group of three had already left.
         When he returned to the alley, Liu Long sighed and said in a low voice,""The three yang ... Are so terrifying!"
         At this moment, he was even more impressed by Yuan Shuo.
         They were both douqian, but the other party had killed the three suns. As for him, when he saw the three suns Yao Cheng fighting the bronze armored soldier, he knew that he was no match for him.
         When he saw the Samsara King easily imprison the bronze-armored warrior, he understood that it would only take an instant for the other party to kill him.
         The difference was too great!
         However, Yuan Shuo had broken this gap. When he thought about how he had thought that he would be on the same level as Yuan Shuo after entering the warrior of the thousand class ... The more he thought about it, the more inferior he felt. Forget it, the gap was too wide.
         Moreover, Yuan Shuo had already entered the level of the spirit accumulation stage.
         But at this moment, Li Hao said in a low voice,""Let's not talk about this, boss. Just now, Yama sent people in to investigate, and I saw that li Dahu!"
         As an earth element expert, it was normal for the other party to be sent to investigate.
         This was because an earth-type expert would have a way to deal with hei Teng in this place. He sealed off the earth, and the other party would lose the support of his power. Even if he was only in the early stage of the radiant sun realm, li Dahu was confident that he could deal with hei Teng.
         Hearing this, Liu Long nodded his head slightly, but he still said,""I saw that Yaocheng was with him too ..."
         "Then follow them and wait for them to separate!"
         "They can't stay together all the time," Li Hao said in a low voice."As long as they don't encounter any danger, they'll definitely explore separately. The more people there are, the more attention they'll attract. Besides, be it superpowers or martial masters, who wouldn't want to search for treasures alone? Now, an ancient city's outer city was open to them. Boss, do you think they can bear it? That Yaocheng will always bring these people with him?"
         It was impossible!
          In any case, Li Hao didn't think it was possible.
         "Then follow them!" Liu Long's eyes flickered and he nodded.
         At the side, Liu Yan was a little hesitant.""It's too dangerous. If a battle breaks out, it will attract hei Teng and other experts ... Why don't we wait for Crimson Moon and the night patrollers to enter this place ..."
         Li Hao quickly interrupted him."That won't do. Once there are too many people, it'll be even more dangerous!" Now, as long as there was a slight movement, they would think that the other party had encountered hei Teng! That's because Black Phoenix is the same as us, without any superpowers ..."
         Thinking of this, Li Hao felt a little regretful."If we can get three black armors," he said,"it'll be better if we pretend to be black armors!"
         "Why don't we ... Go get three black puppets first?" his eyes flickered.
         There's a way to deal with it!
         Previously, the reincarnation King had given them an idea.
         It would be fine as long as he could isolate them from the Earth's energy. It was just that it wouldn't be easy to break through ... It didn't matter. He could just break through it by force. Putting everything else aside, his sword would definitely be able to break through the black banner.
         So what if it's broken?
        
         As soon as he said that, Liu Long's eyes flickered as he reminded,""It might not be useful ... If we encounter the real hei Teng, we might be able to identify him. Otherwise, if the night patrolman gets his hands on it and impersonates him, wouldn't he be able to sneak into the inner city?"
         Li Hao nodded. There might be some ways to distinguish between armored soldiers.
         But ... We're not trying to sneak into the inner city, we're pretending to be hei Teng!
         He didn't need to hide it from the black Phoenix.
         "I don't care anymore ..."
         Li Hao whispered,"we have a good chance. There's a Black Phoenix patrolling the back alley several times. There's also a patrol in front of us, followed by a team of ten!" Let's get rid of the two black Phoenix that are acting alone first, then find a way to get a third one ... It seems like there are black Phoenix patrolling every street, and they are all alone, with 10 of them forming teams!"
         After observing for so long, they still had some gains.
         A 10-man team was not easy to deal with.
         Not to mention whether they could win, the key was that it would not be good if they caused a big commotion and attracted a large force.
         As for the leader of the patrol, he was probably there to test the waters with Black Phoenix. Li Hao didn't care about that. Black Phoenix's large-scale operation was probably to find Yama and the others.
          Liu Long thought for a moment and quickly made a decision.
         "Alright!"
         Liu Yan didn't have the right to speak at this moment.
         The two of them made up their minds and did not delay any further. They quickly crouched down and went to the end of the back alley, waiting for hei Teng, who was patrolling alone.
         As for the plan, he already had one.
         "Boss, I'll instantly activate the terrain and shake the ground so that black armor can leave the ground! What you need to do is also simple. Attack by force and hit the other party into the sky until the other party loses the support of the ground and completely turns into armor. Then, we will succeed! We're not supers, so we don't have any special control skills. It's all up to you!"
         If Liu Long allowed the opponent to land on the ground, all his efforts would be in vain!
         This was a test of a Martial master's control.
         "When Yama and his men attacked, I observed that it took about a minute for Black Phoenix to lose all resistance ... Also, that 10-man team will arrive in about a minute ... So, boss needs to think of a way to move him forward ... It's best if he can drag him into an alley!"
         Liu Long took a deep breath. 'Damn it, your expectations of me are getting higher and higher!'
         However, after thinking for a moment, he quickly nodded.""Don't worry!"
         Hei Teng was only Yue Ming, while he was the Martial Master of the Qian dynasty.
         Even though it was a little difficult, it was still doable.
         ……
         After a while.
         A black skeleton walked towards them with firm steps.
         They robotically surveyed their surroundings.
         The moment the other party approached the alley, Li Hao activated his terrain ability. He lightly stomped his foot. There was no sound, but the ground shook slightly. Li Hao had the urge to vomit blood. The ground here contained a special energy and had a backlash.
         He was so shocked that he almost vomited blood!
          However, he had tested it a little before and found that the influence of Shi could still be sustained.  As expected, the black Phoenix was instantly jolted off the ground.
         Right at this moment, Liu Long dashed out like a cheetah. His speed was extremely fast, and he punched out like a cannonball, sending hei Teng flying into the sky.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com And this required extremely strong control.
         Liu Long was also trembling with fear. Fortunately, hei Teng did not bark.
         Liu Long tried his best to wrap his fist in the waves to make the sound softer.
         He didn't dare to jump into the air, so he could only wait for his opponent to land. Then, he carefully gave his opponent another punch.
         At this moment, it was like a balloon falling to the ground. They couldn't let the balloon fall to the ground, but they also couldn't hit it too hard and let the balloon fly off its original track. Otherwise, once it fell to the other end of the street, they would soon encounter that team.
         Liu Long was also trembling with fear.
         As he continued to strike, hei Teng suddenly struggled for a moment, slightly deviating from his original trajectory and falling backwards, causing Liu Long to be startled.
         At this moment, Li Hao rushed over and threw a punch. With a bang, hei Teng was sent back to his original track.
         The two of them were sweating profusely!
         The crisp sound spread far and wide on the quiet street.
         Li Hao swallowed his saliva. Liu Long and the rest of the black banner landed again. Without saying anything, they grabbed the head of the other party with one hand and dragged him into the alley.
         Li Hao was also scared witless. He hurriedly followed them in.
         The two of them entered the alley and madly beat each other up.
         Time slowly passed.
         Hei Teng gradually lost his ability to resist ...
         In the next moment, Li Hao and Liu Long, one holding his legs and the other his head, firmly held hei Teng down. They didn't move, as if they were waiting for something.
          Sure enough, the footsteps came again.
         A small team passed by the alley they were in.
         After waiting for a while, the footsteps gradually faded away, and the two of them were sweating profusely.
         As for hei Teng, he had already stopped moving.
         Li Hao smiled, and Liu Long also smiled.
         The first one was done!
         Li Hao touched it carefully. This thing seemed to be a single entity. He didn't know how he could get in. There might be some special method, but now was not the time to find a way.
         He held the starry sky sword in his hand and pondered where to start. After cutting it open, he could still wear it normally and it wouldn't fall apart in battle.
         "Cut it from the crotch!"
         "Cut a hole and get in!" Liu Long whispered. Although we martial masters don't go out of our way to shrink our bones, it's not impossible for us to do so ... No one cares about our crotch, so it's more secretive!"
        
         He would cut a hole in his crotch and then crawl in. This way, it wouldn't be too obvious.
         Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded.
         This one was not bad.
         Very quickly, he made a cut on the armor. As expected, the sharpness of the starry sky sword was beyond doubt. The armor that even the sunlight couldn't break was quickly cut open by his starry sky sword.
         Liu Long didn't say anything, but he had already made a judgment in his heart.
         This was the Li family's sword!
         It was extremely sharp!
         Li Hao cut open the armor and vaguely saw white bones. They instantly turned into dust and disappeared into the armor.
         Li Hao didn't feel much for these ancient soldiers. They loyally carried out the orders from back then. They were indeed soldiers. Unfortunately, Li Hao needed Black Phoenix now.
         He didn't have the time to feel sad for these ancient people.
          Li Hao looked at himself, then at Liu Long. He found that Liu Long's figure was more suitable for the black armor.
         "Boss, you go in!"
         Liu Long cursed under his breath. However, he still obediently lifted up the black armor and buried his head into the black armor's crotch. During this process, his bones were making cracking sounds.
         A moment later, Liu Long forced himself into the trap.
         However, his two legs were still exposed.
         After a while, Liu Long tried to pull his legs back in. After a while, he finally managed to put his legs in. However, the opening under his crotch was a little bigger.
         After putting on the armor, Li Hao carefully observed it ... As long as he didn't look at his crotch, he couldn't see anything unusual.
         However, Liu Long's pants were torn in the process of putting it on. Li Hao couldn't help but remind him in a low voice,""Boss, your legs are still a little white. It's a little dazzling in the dark!"
         There was a hole in his crotch, but he didn't know how to sew it up. He could see some white on his inner thighs.
         Liu Long's legs ... Were still a little white.
         Liu Long cursed in a low voice, his voice coming out from the armor, sounding extremely weak.
         Li Hao didn't care about this. He thought for a while, ran to a distant place, smeared some black dust on the foot of the wall, and quickly came back to smear it on Liu Long's big white leg.
         In this way, it was not too eye-catching.
         Liu Long, on the other hand, tried to swing his fist and sighed,""This armor looks strong, but it's flexible and soft inside. It's unbelievable that it's from an ancient civilization. It doesn't affect a Martial master's performance!"
         The sturdy armor was sometimes a form of restraint.
         However, at this moment, it didn't affect his performance at all. Even Liu Long was somewhat shocked. During the ancient civilization, these techniques had truly reached a peak!
          "Stop sighing, go get another one!"  Li Hao didn't have time to talk to him about this. Red moon's group had arrived at about the same time as Yama's group. Soon, a large number of supers would gather here. He had to get three sets of armor first.
         As for whether Yama and the others were pretending to be hei Teng ... As long as they were willing to destroy it, it would be fine. Furthermore, this armor did not seem suitable for supers to wear, as it might isolate the mystic energy.
         Although Li Hao had never tried it, and he was not a super, his previous superpower attacks had clearly failed to penetrate the armor. If they could not penetrate the armor, could they do it inside?
         Not necessarily!
         However, Li Hao knew the most powerful Martial Master in the large organizations. She was Hong Yitang's daughter, an existence who had broken through the late-hundred-stage. He wasn't worried at all.
         Everyone else, even Hong Yitang, was a super now.
         Thus, Li Hao wasn't worried about meeting another Black Phoenix in disguise ... If he really met one, those people would be courting death. On their side, Liu Long was a warrior of thousands. Even if the other party was a fake three suns, with their superpowers restricted by Black Phoenix, they would only be courting death.
         Li Hao and the others began their second hunt.
         This time, with his experience, he was even more confident. Not long after, he obtained the second armor.
         This time, Li Hao gave it to Liu Yan, mainly because she was too short. Li Hao was afraid that if he put it on her, half of his leg would be exposed.
         The difficulty of obtaining the third one was higher because they had to go to the street where Yama Yao Cheng and the others were to capture the patrolman who was acting alone.
         Two of the three were wearing black armor as they ran towards the street ahead.
         At this moment, there were some noises in the outer city. It was likely that some supers had encountered Black Phoenix.
         The few of them didn't have the mood to pay attention to it. They had to disguise themselves first.
         ……
          Obtaining the third set of armor was full of excitement.
         Just as the three of them finished off the third armor, a few supers rushed over. Fortunately, they ran quickly and were not seen by the other party. However, at that moment, there were more supers on the streets.
         It was obvious that Red Moon and the others had arrived while they were dealing with hei Teng. The main force did not enter, but they had sent people in to explore.
         ……
         A few minutes later.
         There were three more black-armored soldiers on the street.
         It was a little awkward. Their movements were not so natural, and their footsteps were sometimes not in sync. There was a slight difference between their footsteps and the black Phoenix 's.
         Upon closer inspection, one could see that the crotch area of his pants seemed to be slightly damaged.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, this was the best disguise they could think of.
         The three black armors ... Were also out of place with the other black armors. They were either alone or in a team of ten. They seemed a little special, but the others didn't understand, and Li haoliang and the others wouldn't guess anything.
        
         On the streets.
         "Da da da" footsteps sounded.
         In the corner, a super expert held his breath and did not dare to move. He compressed his power within his body and did not dare to let it leak out. In the darkness, he listened to the footsteps slowly fade away before he breathed in.
         The three suns could easily deal with the black Phoenix.
         He could not.
         As an expert of the Yue Ying level, he was a powerful figure in the outside world. As long as he didn't provoke the three major organizations and the night patrollers, even the swords gate wouldn't dare to attack an expert of the Yue Ying level.
         However, here ... Not only were the elites of the large organizations here, but a group of sunlit soldiers had also died as soon as they entered the ancient city.
         Yue Ming was really nothing.
         The black-armored soldiers could feel that they were the lowest-ranking soldiers in the ancient city, but they could still kill Yue Ming and even sunlit. There were too many limitations to their superpowers here.
         At this moment, the Super expert felt a little sad when he thought of this.
          He actually didn't want to explore anymore ... However, as a subordinate member of the Yama, if he dared to run now, he would be dead.
         The Yama had raised them, so if they ran, it would be betrayal.
         Betraying a large organization would not end well.
         Just as he was thinking, he suddenly felt his hair stand on end.
         In the darkness, a sharp sword instantly stabbed out!
         Puchi!
         The head fell.
         Three sets of armor appeared behind him without a sound.
         Even black Phoenix had footsteps.
         When the footsteps left, it meant that hei Teng had disappeared. Anyone who had seen it would have this idea.
         And in fact, it was indeed so.
         Black Phoenix was meant to walk on the ground.
         However, the three people in front of him were fake.
         The disappearance of the footsteps was also the time when the supers were the most relaxed. After the three of them created the footsteps, they would quickly disappear in the dark. At that time, with the abilities of martial masters, it was too easy to get close to these supers who had retracted their powers.
         These people also knew that hei Teng couldn't release his mysterious energy with him around.
         However, without the help of the mysterious power, superhumans were just ordinary people.
         Kill with one sword!
         Li Hao didn't know this person, but from his clothes, he was from Yama.
         Other than the night patrolmen who could not be killed indiscriminately ... So what if he killed the others?
         A full moon ... Was better than nothing.
         If he extracted all of the mysterious energy, he might be able to extract about 50 cubic meters. After all, it was just Dark Moon, not sunlight. However, at this moment, it was obvious that he could not extract all of it. It would be good enough if he could take away a portion of it. He could probably only provide about 20 to 30 cubic meters of it in a month's profit.
         Absorbing twenty to thirty cubic meters was actually a very fast thing.
         As for the corpses, they didn't need special treatment.
         The ground here was the best processor. It wouldn't take long for this place to return to its original state, and even the corpses would be devoured by the ground.
         This was a man-eating city!
         Killing people here, as long as no one saw it, the darkness would cover many dark and dangerous things.
         A moment later, three sets of footsteps were heard again.
          The living should retreat!  The black armor was the best defensive tool.
         As for the mysterious energy that he took away, Li Hao absorbed it as he walked. As for the energy that leaked out ... Who cared?
         There were superpowers everywhere.
         It was endless!
         After absorbing this one and killing another, there would naturally be another one.
         Li Hao naturally didn't have a good impression of the large organizations. It was the same for Liu Long. Other than the night watchers, everyone else was a heretic in his eyes, a scourge that would bring disaster to the world.
         One death meant one less!
         Behind him, the headless corpse was gradually devoured by the ground.
         ? ……
         In a place not too far away from Li Hao's group.
         Tiger soul was waiting with the two dark moons.
         After waiting for a long time, they looked at the house in front of them. They all felt heavy.
         He was dead!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just now, he still had three moon nether underlings, but in order to investigate clearly, Tiger soul had one of them enter a building that might be a restaurant. In the end, there was only a muffled sound, and then ... There was no more movement.
         These houses were like man-eating monsters.
         After he entered, there was no trace of him.
         "Damn it!"
         Tiger soul cursed, a little annoyed.
         He was dead!
         This place was too dangerous.
         They had to avoid the patrolling Black Phoenix and find out what was going on. They couldn't even enter the house, as they would disappear once they entered.
         Should he go back now?
         How was he going to explain it when he returned?
         If they asked him what he had found, could it be that the house would eat people ... And then it was gone?
         He turned his head to look at the other side of the street. After crossing the street, he could vaguely see some light. It was brighter there, so it might be the inner city that the night patrolman had mentioned.
         Do you want to go over there and take a look?
          However, Tiger soul was worried that it would be very dangerous.
         "I'm not waiting!"
         He said in a low voice,"there's no need to wait any longer. That subordinate is probably dead."
         If they continued to wait, the next wave of Black Phoenix would arrive.
         They had finally figured out the pattern. About ten minutes or so, a ten-man team of black armor would pass by.
         Even though he was already at the glorious sun tier, Tiger soul didn't dare to provoke these black hou.
         He might not be able to defeat ten of them. Even if he could, his superpower would be exposed and more Black Phoenix would be attracted. He would be dead for sure.
         Unfortunately, he didn't meet any who were alone.
         In fact, he was also very interested in hei Teng.
         However, these Black Phoenix moved in groups. None of them were alone ... In fact, there were, but Li Hao's group had taken care of those who were alone in the last three streets.
        
         There were definitely more than three streets.
         However, the black-armored soldiers on the other streets might have been secretly killed by others, or they might not have been discovered.
         At this moment, footsteps were heard again.
         Tiger soul's ears twitched, and he quickly hid at the side with his two subordinates, retracting his powers.
         However, Tiger soul's eyes were a little strange.
         The sound of footsteps ... Didn't seem to be much.
         Yes, they had encountered other Black Phoenix squads before, and they could tell that there were quite a few of them. However, from the sound they heard this time, it seemed that there weren't many of them.
         Gradually, they saw it in the darkness.
         It was very little!
         "Three!"
          Beside him, a Dark Moon super whispered. His voice was very soft, but he was still glared at by Tiger soul!
         He couldn't speak!
         However, he was also surprised that there were only three ...
         Three dark moons ... Without too many black armors, the threat level of the black-armored soldiers would be greatly reduced.
         He was also an earth element user, so he was able to counter hei Teng to some extent. He could still cover the ground beneath his opponent's feet with rocks and soil. Of course, the area he could cover was not large, but even so, it was enough for him to use here.
         Three black Phoenix!
         At this moment, Tiger soul was slightly moved. There were so few people. If he took them down, didn't that mean that he had taken three sets of armor?
         In his opinion, the Samsara King and the others had sacrificed more than a dozen lives, and the three suns had personally taken action, but they had only managed to get 70 or 80 black banners in the end. If he could take down three at this moment ...
         Even if he didn't hide it, if he were to contribute it, wouldn't the credit be not small?
         After capturing the three black puppets, he might be able to return directly without taking the risk to investigate. With the contributions of the three black puppets, he might be able to talk to the reincarnation King.
         He was born as a security Captain, and the Qiao family and the Yama seemed to have a lot of connections.
         However, not long ago, the Qiao family was destroyed. Although he had advanced to sunlit, he still felt that something was missing without the Qiao family.
         Furthermore, the Qiao family had previously provided him with some money and wealth in exchange for the mysterious energy, but now he had lost this channel ...
         All sorts of thoughts appeared in his mind, and Tiger soul was slightly moved.
         However, he still held back.
         Let's observe first!

         In the distance.
         Li Hao and the other two weren't like hei Teng, who could only act on instinct. They were martial masters and had very good eyesight. With a glance, they saw three people hiding under a roof nearby. They were motionless, but they were three living people. Unless they were blind, they would naturally be able to see them.
         At this moment, Liu Long, who was standing beside Li Hao, suddenly moved his arm and pressed it against Liu Yan.
         Liu Yan didn't move.
         Liu Long thought that she couldn't hold back, but Liu Yan did.
         After entering the ancient city, Liu Yan understood how dangerous this trip would be.
         ,m As a Martial Master, and a Martial Master who had carried out many missions, although hatred made her crazy, craziness didn't mean stupidity. She knew long ago that the Qiao family had a relationship with the Yama, but she had been holding it in.  Even if Qiao Peng kept on harassing her, she would endure it.
         Liu Long had obviously underestimated her heart.
         Li Dahu!
         Yes, they saw li Dahu, the Tiger soul of Yama.
         He was also the person that Liu Long and Liu Yan wanted to kill the most.
         Liu Yan's footsteps were normal. She didn't move just because she saw li Dahu. This made Liu Long feel a little more at ease.
         The three of them continued walking as if they didn't see him.
         Their steps were unified.
         Gradually, the three of them left li Dahu and the others behind.
         However, they soon felt something different. Those three people ... Were actually following them carefully.
         The few of them didn't make a move just now because there were too many people, three of them, so it wasn't easy to make a move.
         It would easily cause a huge commotion.
         Therefore, even if they saw their enemies, they chose not to make a move.
         However, they didn't expect the three of them to be so bold as to follow them.
         Clearly, they didn't want to attack, but these three people wanted to attack them.
         He was really ... Bold!
         On this Street, there was another team of ten black Phoenix members. Li Hao's group of three knew that this team would arrive very soon. At this moment, the three of them were still walking, not showing any signs of abnormality.
         However, when the people behind him couldn't see him, Liu Long gently made a hand gesture.
         "Kill or not?"
         The three of them had actually followed him.
         The levels of superpowers were easy to identify, not to mention that Li Hao was here. With a glance, he could tell that one of them was at the sunlit realm, while the other two were at the Dark Moon and full moon realm.
         In terms of strength and level, he was actually on par with Li Hao and the others.
         One was a warrior of thousands, and the other two were over a hundred.
          However, the three of them were hei Teng, and the other party didn't dare to reveal too much of his mysterious ability. If they were caught off guard, they would definitely have the advantage. What they were afraid of was that if they couldn't take down the other party for a long time, hei Meng would come after them ... That would be really troublesome.
         Once entangled, it would be difficult to escape.
         At this moment, Li Hao regretfully couldn't use voice transmission.
         The teachers would!
         He knew about this, but when he asked, his teacher said that it required a good control of Shi, or one could even enter the three suns.
         Otherwise, he could only speak.
         Otherwise, they could still discuss countermeasures.
         Even Liu Long of the battle of thousands could not use the secret Sound transmission technique at this moment.
         Because he had only just mastered his Shi, he had not yet reached the stage where he could master it in detail. However, Qian combat was also fast enough. Soon, he would be able to master this seemingly useless skill, which was actually quite effective.
         When Liu Long asked if he should kill her, Liu Yan, who was most eager for revenge, made a very subtle hand gesture ... No.
        
         She didn't want everyone to choose to kill impulsively because of her, as that would expose them.
         The 10-man black Phoenix team would be here soon.
         If it was only one person, he was confident that he could kill them quickly.
         If there were three of them, the slightest mistake could easily cause someone to escape or make a loud noise, dragging the three of them into danger.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He was thinking.
         After thinking for a while, he pointed at his feet.
         It wasn't easy to talk, and hand gestures weren't omnipotent.
         Now, it was time to test their tacit understanding.
         If the two of them couldn't understand it ... They could only give up this opportunity.
         Under the armor, Liu Long saw Li Hao pointing at his feet. At first, he thought Li Hao was talking about the ground shaking ... He thought Li Hao was going to use force.
          But very quickly, he felt that something was wrong.
         After thinking for a while, he, as the captain, quickly understood Li Hao's thoughts.
         "When dealing with the black Phoenix, the first thought is to isolate them from the ground. The earth element li Dahu will definitely use his earth element to isolate the black Phoenix ... Without the support of the earth, the black Phoenix will lose its momentum ... Should we ambush them when they think that the black Phoenix has lost its momentum?"
         He quickly began to think.
         Liu Long wasn't a fool. As the leader of the demon hunting squad, it was precisely because he was vigilant, bold, and careful that he was able to lead his squad to survive.
         Of course, in Yuan Shuo's eyes, he was a fool.
         But at this moment, he finally understood what Li Hao meant!
         Seize the opportunity and attack li Dahu!
         Black Phoenix, who had lost its power, would make the three of them lose their vigilance. Martial masters were the group with the strongest concealment ability. They were different from supers, who could not even play dead. When one was close to a superpower, even the strong could feel the vitality of the mysterious power.
         Liu Long had thought it through and felt that this move might be very useful.
         However ... Just like Li Hao, he was worried that Liu Yan didn't understand.
         If Liu Yan chose to continue her attack after the enemy had taken control of the ground, not only would all their plans be disrupted, but they would also attract the enemy's attention. A huge battle might even break out, leading to more trouble.
         At this moment, the two men in Black armor looked at Liu Yan.
         Liu Long seemed to have understood what he meant. Li Hao knew that his boss was capable and should be able to understand his plan.
         The key was Liu Yan ...
         It wasn't that a woman's IQ wasn't high, and she had big breasts but no brains, but ... But Liu Yan and Li Dahu had a grudge. He was afraid that she wouldn't be able to understand at the critical moment. Once the other party got close, her rationality would be replaced by anger, and that would be a huge problem.
         Seeing that Liu Yan didn't give any response, Liu Long could only make another hand gesture.
         "Playing dead!"
         Hand gestures could only give short instructions.
         Playing dead, ground, earth ...
         With the combination of these keywords, Liu Yan finally understood and gestured,""Received!"
          However, Li Hao and Liu Long were both worried ... Don't misunderstand!  It was as if she knew that the two of them might not trust her ... Liu Yan felt helpless.
         Did women deserve to be discriminated against?
         She really understood.
         Liu Long was one thing, but Li Hao, this newcomer, actually dared to question a patrol who had been in law enforcement for many years. What a bastard.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wasn't it just li Dahu who could lock the ground and play dead, pretending to have lost his kinetic energy?
         Do you really think I'm a fool?
         Then, he would take the opportunity to kill the three of them. Who didn't understand this logic?
         She was a little annoyed, but she also knew that this was not the time to be careless. She could only make another hand gesture."You, Shorty!"
         He made a hand gesture to Li Hao.
         Li Hao understood!
         It seemed like Liu Yan really understood. She told him to deal with the shortest one and the tallest one was li Dahu. Needless to say, Liu Long had to do it.
         As for the shortest one, he would deal with it himself.
         The remaining one was naturally Liu Yan 's.
         After confirming the target and the plan, they would launch a surprise attack. This way, there would not be any misunderstandings or trouble, which would cause someone to escape successfully.
         Seeing her make such a gesture, Li Hao and the other man finally relaxed.
         It was not a big problem for Liu Long to deal with li Dahu.
         As long as he used the nine-fold force in time and launched a surprise attack, he could kill an early stage sunlit realm super with one punch ... If he could not kill Liu Long, he would be too useless. Martial Master douqian, Yuan Shuo, could kill three suns.
         Even Li Hao would look down on him if he couldn't kill an early stage solar glory cultivator with his sneak attack.
         Li Hao and the others weren't afraid of a head-on collision.
         However, this was not the time for a head-on collision.
          Earth energy ... Li Hao still needed it.
         A single sunlight cultivator could extract two to three hundred cubic meters of earth energy.
         Behind him, the three of them were still secretly following him.
         They were quite courageous and lagged behind a little. When the footsteps gradually disappeared, Tiger soul said in a low voice,""The three black Phoenix are all at the Dark Moon realm! As long as I can cover the area beneath their feet in an instant and control their energy transmission, there shouldn't be a big problem. The most important thing was to be fast! According to my observations, there is another team that will arrive soon. We have to take down these three black armors before they arrive ... As long as we take them down, we can go back and gather with the rest of the Army. It will be much safer!"
         The two dark moons were also tempted.
         This place did indeed feel dangerous.
         However, Yue Ming didn't have any say in this operation.
         "It's Lord Tiger soul's decision!"
         The two of them quickly came to a decision. As long as the Tiger soul could control the three black puppets and prevent them from receiving any power boost, they were still confident that they could quickly deal with the three black puppets.
         If this continued for about a minute, the three black puppets would completely lose their combat strength.
