Li Hao was stunned.He didn't say anything and just fell into deep thought.If the Black Panther could talk ... Would he not treat it as a pet anymore?A talking dog and a dog that couldn't talk were actually different.If they could speak, then they would be true cultivators.No... That was still a pet.Li Hao was already used to it.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ But if one day, the Black Panther really spoke, would he treat people like second cat or Li Fu hai as pets?Would they treat the Dragon Lord and these great demons as pets?Obviously not!When communicating with demons like them, they were on equal footing, and everyone was a cultivator ...As for Black Panther, he was obviously not an idiot.It was a rank five venerable sovereign, so it should be aware of this.Once it opened its mouth, it would no longer be a simple pet, even if ... The status of venerable sovereigns was far higher than that of pets.However, what was the point of having such a high status?Did it not have any status now?Perhaps it simply didn't want to leave Li Hao. When it was very young, when it was still wandering, it followed Li Hao. Before it gained intelligence, it followed Li Hao ...Even though many things had happened, it still followed Li Hao ...One day, if it spoke, perhaps ... Li Hao would no longer bring it along.That meant that it had grown up and was independent. It was an intelligent and responsible great demon Thearch.Li Hao had never thought of this before.He had always felt that the Black Panther's voice might be unpleasant to hear, or it might be too young, or something else ... It was said that its ancestor, the demon subduing envoy of new martial arts, had also had a young voice in the past, so it only spoke after a long time.Li Hao thought so too.However, he could not understand why black Panther still did not speak even after he had reached fifth rank venerable sovereign.At this moment, Kong Ji, who was an onlooker, seemed to have seen through the reason.Li Hao was silent for a while.In his opinion, when a human or a demon could speak and communicate, they were indeed a normal living creature. At this time, they could not be considered as pets.As for the Black Panther ... Even now, he still felt that this fellow was still his pet dog.So, it was just that he was confused by the situation and did not understand Black Panther's operation, but outsiders did?Li Hao fell into deep thought and soon smiled again. At this moment, he looked at the Black Panther and did not say anything more. He patted the Black Panther's super big head and laughed: "Forget it, maybe I heard it wrong, or it was an empty sound ... If it can't talk, then so be it. I can only say that my dog is stupid!"The Black Panther wagged its tail and seemed to be quite happy.Yes, you're hearing things.I don't know how to speak!Kong Ji was also speechless. In his speechlessness, he suddenly felt a little emotional and envious. At the level of the Black Panther, a fifth rank venerable sovereign and the master of the world, at this time, it was willing to be a pet instead of a high and mighty venerable sovereign!Why?Perhaps ... It was a relationship.Perhaps, it was because she didn't want to be separated from Li Hao.In any case, they were all saying that Li Hao was worthy of the dog. It was rare for the dog to give up its so-called identity and be Li Hao's pet.……The two people and one dog didn't communicate anymore.Li Hao and Kong Ji entered the Black Panther's stomach.They didn't enter the Silver Moon, but sat on the world of the Silver Moon in its belly. Although the Black Panther's physical body was blocking them, it couldn't stop the two of them. They could observe the outside world.Li Hao thought of what had happened back then, and of the Black Panther's unwillingness to speak. In the chaos, most of the time, telepathy was needed to communicate, and the Black Panther was unwilling to do so. Thus, Li Hao said again,""It's still the same. I'll speak for you. We'll adjust our mental fluctuations to the same pattern as the secret technique of five birds. You'll just have to react to whatever I say." Back then, Li Hao had also used this method to obtain his first large sum of resources in Silver Moon. He had even raided the lair of a Duke in Silver Moon!This time, he wouldn't confiscate the property of firephoenix for the time being. However, if the opportunity arose, perhaps ... He could confiscate the property of firephoenix once.Li Hao felt that it was somewhat familiar.As for the Black Panther, it seemed to be a little excited. Since Li Hao was willing to take over, it was even better. It was very happy that it could still be the same as before. It didn't need to think about anything, just cooperate with Li Hao.……The fire Phoenix World.The realm gate was huge, luxurious, and even luxurious!The huge realm gate was different from the realm gates of other worlds. The realm gates of some worlds were either cracks or holes. However, the realm gate here was a real gate. He had never seen such a style in the human world. But here, in the territory of the primordial chaos beasts, he saw it.It was like a heavenly Palace!The archway stood tall in the chaos, with special words written on it,"Xuanji Phoenix"!It wasn't words, but an imprint of will.At first glance, it looked like a phoenix soaring through the chaos with flames filling the sky. Fire Phoenix ... Li Hao suddenly thought of Minister hou. Hou Xiaochen's spear seemed to be made of the spirit of a fire Phoenix.However, although this spear had been very powerful back then, it was now too weak to be used by hou Xiaochen.If this world's Dao Lord, the rank 7 Fire Phoenix, was refined into a fire Phoenix spear ... Hou Xiaochen would probably be able to use it without any problems ...Li Hao suddenly had such a thought.

Chapter 3161 Ambition (4)
He could not help but laugh.Not only do I want to kill a seventh rank venerable sovereign, but I also want to refine a seventh rank venerable sovereign into a spear.At the entrance of the fire Phoenix World, there were two chaos beasts guarding.They weren't weak, they were all venerable sovereigns.It was rare to see a venerable sovereign guarding the door.Of course, it was very rare to be a first level venerable sovereign.Moreover, they were all fire phoenixes. It seemed like the fire Phoenix Clan was developing well here.Seeing the Black Panther, which looked like a big dog, the two fire phoenixes glanced at it and felt its powerful aura. They could not tell for sure, but they knew that it was a middle-stage venerable sovereign."Fellow Daoist, is this your first time in the fire Phoenix realm?" one of the fire phoenixes asked."Not bad!"Li Hao took over the right to speak. He went straight to the point. "It's my first time here, my first time in the Dragon field! I've heard that this is the territory of my chaos race, and we can trade as we wish in the fire Phoenix World ... With the Dragon Lord's protection, the chaos race is not allowed to kill each other. Is this true?"The fire Phoenix who had spoken had a slight change in her expression and quickly said,""Naturally! It's your first time here, so you don't know the situation in the Dragon field. Here, the chaotic race is Supreme. The Dragon field is large enough for us to survive. Why are we killing each other? Of course, there are also some humans and demons active here ... Of course, in my Fire Phoenix World, the chaos race is still the leader. As long as fellow Daoist doesn't deliberately kill, you will enjoy the best treatment ...""Fellow Daoist ... Have you entered the intermediate level?" he asked."I am a rank five venerable sovereign!"Black Panther also raised his head. A fifth rank venerable sovereign was not a weakling.The fire Phoenix instantly turned solemn,"so it's senior fellow Daoist!" Rank five venerable sovereigns ... In the firephoenix realm, you can be an elder. If senior is interested, I can introduce you to the Phoenix Emperor!""No... Not now. I'll come to you if I need you. Right now ... I just want to know more about the Dragon field and ... If there's a way to join the dragon world ..."The fire Phoenix felt a little helpless.It was like this again!Although the fire Phoenix World was a rank seven world, the experts in the Dragon field all had their eyes on the dragon world, especially those in the intermediate rank. It was better for those in the initial rank, but almost all of them went straight to the dragon world.That's right, it's a rank eight world. "I'm not sure about that. Senior, you can enter the fire Phoenix World first to take a look ... Perhaps you'll have a chance." The fire Phoenix was no longer so enthusiastic and quickly said,""In addition ... After senior enters the fire Phoenix realm, you are not allowed to attack without permission within the realm, especially those from the chaos race. If any human or demon provokes senior, try not to kill them directly ..."In other words, other than the Beasts of Chaos, the others could be injured but not killed. If he killed them in the realm, how would he be able to do business later?Li Hao was a little surprised. There was a rule that did not allow killing ... This was very rare!"I know!"Li Hao was a little impatient, but he didn't get angry. Instead, he said,""By the way, after I enter, if I see something I like, what will I use to trade?""World, Dao crystal, Dao accumulation crystal, monarch weapon, all of these are fine!""If you have a high-grade two-legged beast...High-grade human powerhouses, talented young humans, or beautiful humans," the fire Phoenix continued,"you can trade them."The other party continued,"normal blood food is fine, their level is too low!" If there are any venerable sovereigns of the human race, they can also be used as trading partners ... Of course, senior, there are some venerable sovereigns of the human race that can not be captured ...""What?""It's easy to tell that if some of the human venerable sovereigns have a Golden Dragon on their foreheads ... Then we can't capture or kill them! This means that he's also a citizen of the Dragon Realm and has received the acknowledgment of the Dragon Realm. He's also been strengthened by the power of a great Dao!"The fire Phoenix explained to Li Hao dutifully,"although these venerable sovereigns are humans, they've worked for the Dragon field and won the Dragon Lord's approval. Under such circumstances ... They can't be made partners or even touched. Otherwise, they'll be challenging the Dragon Lord and the Dragon field! These humans can also be regarded as the chaos race. Even if senior doesn't approve of them, they can't express it. This is the dignity of a Dragon Master!"Li Hao understood again!Perhaps some chaos beasts did not approve of it, but the Dragon Lord seemed to have acknowledged their identity. The Dragon Lord's ambition was not small. He probably had the intention of using the human race to rule the human race and assimilate them.In an instant, he understood some of the meanings within.The Dragon Lord, from a side perspective, was even more difficult to deal with."Human ... Alright, I know!"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao replied, and then couldn't help but ask,""If I eat a few ... Will I be killed?""It's best if senior doesn't have such thoughts. There's a lot of blood food. If senior wants to eat it, one Dao crystal can buy thousands of two-legged beasts in the fire Phoenix World, but ... Don't have any ideas about these guys. Some of them even control some worlds and are targets supported by the Dragon Lord. Senior ... Don't try to provoke the Dragon Lord!"Li Hao understood, and his heart moved.The world Lord!Good Lord, the Dragon Lord actually supported a portion of the human race to control the world. This ... Might not be a good thing.

Chapter 3162 Ambition (3)_5
Only then would the human race understand the human race better.Only then would he be able to control the human race.This time, Li Hao was more vigilant, but he said,""I know. It's so troublesome."The fire Phoenix did not say anything more and did not continue.He was a fifth rank venerable sovereign, after all, and he only needed to say it once. He didn't need to say more. If the other party didn't listen, there was nothing he could do ... If he was killed by the experts of the dragon world, it would have nothing to do with him.……The Black Panther quickly entered the world through the realm gate.The moment he entered, Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He looked into the distance and saw a huge city in the sky. It seemed to be built on top of a huge tree. A city was formed on the crown of the tree!In the sky above the city, there was a fire Phoenix.In addition ... Li Hao actually saw the figures of some Dragons. He was surprised. The dragons ... Seemed to have a Garrison here.He took a slight breath.This ... Did it mean that the Dragon Lord had absolute control over these rank Seven Worlds? otherwise, it was not normal for experts from other worlds to be in his own world.The Dragon field seemed to be more terrifying than he had thought.At this moment, Kong Ji also sensed it and was a little surprised.""There's actually an expert from the Dragon race in the fire Phoenix World ... This ... What's the fire Phoenix master thinking?"Is he crazy?The Alliance was still acceptable, but it was really unreasonable to let the other party's experts guard the world. This didn't just represent an Alliance, it was also submission!"The Dragon Lord is very terrifying!"Li Hao sent a voice transmission."It might be more powerful than we thought. It can make even a rank seven venerable sovereign submit to it ... It's not too difficult for a rank eight world to control a rank six world, but to control a rank seven world ... You should know that it was as difficult as ascending to the sky to subdue the Crimson Moon. It's much more difficult than annihilating it."Kong Ji nodded his head solemnly and said,""That's right. My world of light actually has some vassal worlds. There are also Level 6 ones, but ... There are no level 7 ones! That's because a level Seven venerable sovereign is in charge of the native world. In addition, with the great Dao universe, as long as we don't take any risks, we have the confidence to resist the attack of a level eight venerable sovereign!""They can't be completely suppressed, or they have to pay a considerable price to suppress it. Under normal circumstances, it's because they are independent. No rank seven Lord will easily submit to a rank eight venerable sovereign.""The situation in the Dragon field is more complicated than what the outside world knows. Here ... The dragon world has taken root too deeply. It's unbelievable. If this goes on, it won't take long for the Dragon field to expand. Unfortunately, my father and the others thought that the new martial arts world was the biggest problem. Now, it seems that it's only based on the situation. I think the Dragon field is the biggest problem!"After all, neo martial was a human force. At least they didn't treat humans as food.However, the beasts of primordial chaos dominated the Dragon field.This was what it meant to be someone who was not of their race!Of course, in the eyes of the strong, they were all the same. They were all enemies.At this moment, Kong Ji was a little solemn. It seemed that the Dragon field was a greater threat than the neo martial artists. There were many tier seven neo martial artists, but they were not worth mentioning compared to the Dragon field. On the surface, there was one rank-8 in the Dragon field, and there were at least 20 rank-7s. This was only based on the number of great worlds. In fact, it would only be more!"Let's go to the city first!"The Black Panther quickly flew toward the huge city in the sky.……At the same time.Above the giant city in the sky, there was a small palace. It was small in comparison, but it was actually extremely huge.At this moment, a woman in red was leaning on a chair and looking down at the city lazily.Behind him, a golden-haired girl suddenly said,""Mother, there's a new person who has entered the realm. He's at the fifth rank and is from the outer realms. From his appearance, he's from the dog Race. As for what race he's from, we don't know yet. He's interested in joining the dragon world!""Yes, I know."The red-robed woman was still as lazy as ever."There's news from the Dragon Realm," the golden-haired girl said."The Silvermoon world might have entered the Dragon Realm. It's a message from the Crimson Moon Lord ... I don't know if it's true or not!""Yes."The red-clothed woman only agreed and didn't say anything else."There's more news from the dragon world," the golden-haired girl said."Let's pay attention to the dog Race!"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "What?""It's said that there's a dog in new martial arts that calls itself the heavenly dog! He is at the peak of the sixth rank, and together with Emperor Cang, they are known as the cangmao and Tiangou. Be careful of the infiltration of neo martial artists. This new member of the dog clan has the strength of the fifth rank ..."The red-robed woman nodded slightly. She knew this.The heavenly Hound!The chaos beasts were very interested in the gray cat and the heavenly dog. These two did not seem to be from the chaos race. However, they also seemed to be. It was hard to say. The gray cat could bring along a tier 7 great world and move it easily. It was even easier and more convenient than the Dragon Lord.A seventh-tier great world was already very huge, and there was also a great path universe. It could be carried around at will at an extremely fast speed without any aura fluctuations ... It could be said that even the Dragon Lord was slightly inferior to it.Otherwise, the Dragon Lord would have taken the dragon world and run away.The Dragon Lord could also bring the world with him, but his speed would be reduced, and he would be at a disadvantage against those of the same rank.Therefore, these top-level chaos beasts were very interested in the two big demons of new martial. They even hoped to catch them and study them in detail."The dog clan ... The new martial's heavenly dog should still be in the chiyang region, right?"The lady in red said, and the golden-haired girl nodded. "It's said that it's over there ... However, it's hard to guarantee that it won't enter my Fire Phoenix World! It's better to be a little more careful and investigate. If he's not, that's for the best, but if he is ... Then we can grab him and study him carefully!"

Chapter 3163 Ambition (6)
"Yes.""We can send someone to test it out," the woman in red nodded."It's said that the heavenly Hound is unyielding and even dares to talk back to the human King. It's arrogant and easily provoked the other party." He chuckled.He seemed to have a great understanding of neo martial!The golden-haired girl, who looked young, was also quite experienced. She nodded.""I understand! If it wasn't for the heavenly Hound, that fifth level venerable sovereign would be worth roping in. If he could reach the sixth level, he could seize a great Dao universe and have a chance to reach the seventh level ...""You're thinking too much,"The woman in red laughed,"seventh rank, how can it be that simple!" It's extremely difficult for us Primal Chaos beings to step into the seventh rank! If it wasn't for the Dragon Lord's extraordinary ability to seize a large number of level-seven universes and make them our great DAOs 'homes, we wouldn't have improved so quickly today ..."His words were filled with admiration for the Dragon Lord.He quickly said,"let's not talk about this. We just need to test it out. Even if it's really the heavenly Hound, it doesn't matter. It's not worth mentioning!" Feng Yan, how's the official business going?" The golden-haired girl, Feng Yan, quickly said,"we've captured many more human geniuses with extremely strong talents and unique DAOs! We've already completed a portion of the transfer and sent them to various places ... However, mother is sending so many humans to other places. It's not just the Dragon Realm ... Putting aside how the humans will react, if news of this gets out and the dragon world finds out ..."At this moment, the young girl was a little worried!All these years, she had been constantly doing this, and she was often worried. She wasn't so bold before. There weren't many people, but recently, there were many, many. A large number of human beings who had been brainwashed or specially trained were being transported to the entire square domain!This was too big a commotion!Recently, mother had become even more unscrupulous. Some elders of the fire Phoenix realm had even gone to forcibly plunder some realms."Don't worry!""You have to understand ... In the Dragon field, nothing ... Can escape the Dragon Lord's eyes!" The woman in red chuckled. Do you understand?"The young girl was startled, but in the next moment, she suddenly felt relieved and let out a sigh."I understand! I've been worried and uneasy before, but now I understand. It seems ... My Fire Phoenix realm isn't doing it alone, is it?""Yes." "We're only from a rank seven world, so what's the point of doing it?"the red-robed woman laughed. You're still too young! In fact, he should have expected this! The reason why the commotion is getting bigger and bigger is because ... The opportunity has come!"The woman in red suddenly laughed."Because of the appearance of the new martial arts and the turmoil in the Hongyue region, the other three regions are completely in turmoil. The entire Sifang region is already a pool of muddy water. Now, perhaps it's the Dragon region's chance! In the Dragon field, with the Dragon Lord, perhaps ... We can establish a territory that belongs to us in the square field. With The Lightning Field, it's a natural chasm. As long as The Lightning Field exists, we'll have the geographical advantage. There's even a chance ... That after we take the sky Field, we'll reach level nine and take over the entire Primal Chaos!"The golden-haired girl's heart also rippled with admiration. After a long while, she said,""Dragon Lord, the hope of the chaos race ..."Seeing her daughter's admiration, the red-clothed woman didn't say anything.With a smile, he looked down at the giant city and said slowly,""Of course, the Three Realms are only secondary. The Dragon Realm needs to be unified internally. I'm in charge of the Thunder realm, while the other realms are in charge of the demon Realm and the other realms! The Thunder World has always been hidden in the vicinity of the Thunder region. However, the Thunder region has recently entered a short period of peace. This is also our opportunity ... How many of our people have entered the Thunder World?"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Not too many. Although the Thunder World is also searching for itinerant cultivators, the other party won't make a move easily. So far, there are only six venerable sovereigns who have infiltrated the lightning tribulation, and it's difficult to send out information ... The strongest has only just entered stage four!"The woman in red nodded slightly."It's already very good. If we can calm the Thunder World during the Dragon Master's conquest of the new martial world, our Fire Phoenix World will definitely be able to rise in the chaos race and completely surpass the other worlds!""Conquering neo martial?""Of course."The woman in red explained to her patiently,""If the Dragon Lord doesn't go, the others will have to be on guard against the Dragon field. Everything in the Dragon field will be paid special attention! With the Dragon Lord gone, we're not worth mentioning in the eyes of the other three regions! At that time, everyone's attention will be focused on the chiyang zone!""Now, we'll take down the Thunder World. If we can take down the demon world as well, we'll completely unify the Dragon field. In fact, the Thunder World has some secret connections with some powerful human worlds. If we can take this opportunity to sneak into the other human worlds and attack them from both the inside and outside ... In the later stages, the Dragon Lord will unify the square field. That will be a great opportunity!"The young girl understood and nodded continuously,"infiltration!" "They all think that we, the chaos race, only know how to kill, thirst for blood, and devour on impulse. No one will care about our infiltration plan, and no one will believe that we, the chaos race, would have such thoughts. However, mother, if the Dragon Lord joins the battle, then ... The neo martial artists are difficult to deal with. Will the Dragon Lord become the main target of the neo martial artists?"Wouldn't that be too dangerous?In this barbarian world ... Yes, in her eyes, neo martial artists were more barbaric and impulsive than chaos beasts. They were still extremely dangerous."The Dragon Lord has his own plans. He won't become cannon fodder for the experts of the other three regions ... You can rest assured.""Continue to execute these guys," the woman in red said."When it's done, you'll take over the Thunder region. The universe of the great path in the Thunder region ... Will be yours!"

Chapter 3164 Ambition (Part 7)
"Mother, is this ... Possible?""Don't worry. As long as the plan succeeds, it'll be yours. No one can take it away from you!"The woman in red was extremely confident, but the golden-haired girl was not. If they really won, there would be too many people competing for it, including many sixth and seventh-level venerable sovereigns in the dragon world. They did not even have a great path universe.There was even more than one Grade 7 one.The woman in red did not say anything more. She smiled and looked at the dog that had entered the city. She did not probe further. Whether it was the heavenly dog or not, she would know after trying. If she tried to probe forcefully and was sensed by the other party, it would ruin her reputation.The fire Phoenix World still wanted its reputation. It had taken the initiative to open its doors to the outside world in order to recruit these itinerant cultivators from the chaos race."Fifth rank ...""Not bad," he murmured softly."If it's not the heavenly Hound, I can start recruiting it."He then turned around and looked into the distance ... That was where the dragon world was.There was a glint in his eyes.He would unify the four-sided region!As for me ... I don't wish to be just the fire Phoenix Sector Lord. Instead ... I wish to be the Queen of the Four Realms!"Long Zhan ... Our daughter is also Tier 6 ... The path to tier 7, have you prepared it for her?"He muttered in his heart. The Thunder World was only an alternative.If they could take down a few level eight worlds or a neo martial world, that would be the best choice.……At this moment, Li Hao, who had just entered the city, vaguely sensed that someone was looking at him.Of course, he didn't dare to investigate.He did not pay much attention to it. It would be surprising if a rank five venerable sovereign entered the realm without being observed. There were many experts in a rank seven great world. They would not let a rank five enter the world core so easily.At this moment, Li Hao, along with the Black Panther's movements, landed on the huge city Road.At this moment, Li Hao's expression suddenly turned grave. He said,""Brother Kong Ji, have any human experts come here?""Eh? No, I'm not sure. Even if there is, it's not the human race of the three regions. Ordinary people don't dare to come ...""Can you tell?" Li Hao asked solemnly."What?" "Words!""What?"What's wrong with words?Kong Ji looked around. Yes, there seemed to be signs hanging on both sides of the street. There were words written on them. They were not simple will imprints, but real words. Although he did not recognize them, he could feel some imprints when he looked at them carefully.He understood the meaning behind it.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ This was Dragon text?It should be. Kong Ji had never learned the Dragon language before. Powerhouses could communicate telepathically, so why would he learn the language of other races?"The characters have been unified!"At this moment, Li Hao sent a voice transmission, the dragon clan's language has become the exclusive language of the fire Phoenix Sector! From the looks of it, the powerful beings who entered the city might all ... The buildings, the civilization, the culture ... Brother kongji, has the fire Phoenix World been assimilated by the dragon world, or is it that ... The Dragon race is rapidly expanding their civilization and influencing the entire Dragon field?"Was there a difference?Kong Ji still didn't care much. He was high and mighty and wasn't used to Li Hao's way of thinking.As for Li Hao, he sent another voice transmission, the most crucial step for a civilization is not the invasion of force, but the invasion of culture! When one's civilization accepted another's culture and even turned it into their own, this also meant that ... One's spirit was ruled by the other! Perhaps ... The fire Phoenix realm has completely become a part of the Dragon Realm. It's fine if it's just a single realm, but if it's the same for other realms ... This means that the Dragon Realm has completely unified the chaos beasts of the Dragon Realm!"That would be terrifying. In the eyes of outsiders, it was impossible.After all, a Lord of the seventh step would never submit to a Lord of the eighth step. They were just an Alliance, so why would they submit?Kong Ji fell into deep thought.The invasion of culture! Everyone was used to martial arts, so he didn't really care about it. However, that didn't mean that he didn't understand it. He was just a little puzzled. After a long time, he transmitted his voice,"Dragon Lord ... Are you not satisfied with dominating the Dragon field? However, he's only at the eighth rank. Eighth rank venerable sovereigns exist in all three regions ...""But the human race is too chaotic! "This time, the new martial artists have set off a Great War. Once a few tier 8 martial artists die, do you think one tier 8 and dozens of tier 7 martial artists can take down the others if they join forces?"There was a long silence.It can't be, right?Li Hao also fell into deep thought.He did not know.However, if he had the chance, he could go to the other seventh-order great worlds to take a look. If it was the same as the fire Phoenix realm, it would be extremely terrifying.

Chapter 3165 Let's Sign The Contract_ 1
"A small world in exchange for ten million great Dao crystals!""Ten million high-grade blood and flesh in exchange for 100000 fire-elemental Dao crystals ...""A middle-level world, a fourth-rank world with 30 billion humans. The ownership of the world can be transferred in exchange for a seventh-rank Dao accumulation crystal ... The amount can be discussed in detail.""A new world has been discovered. You can provide its exact location. The world has yet to open, and it contains countless treasures ... Exchange for a rank three world!"“……”When the Black Panther walked on the enormous Street, there were signs hanging outside the enormous houses on both sides of the street. These signs were branded with will dragon runes.Trade!Some traded worlds, great Dao crystals, Dao accumulation crystals, and even the coordinates of new worlds and people.Each house was so big that the inside couldn't be seen.Some had their doors open, while some had their doors closed.If there was anything that caught his eye, he could go in and discuss it in detail.Of course, some of the doors were open, and one could see some of the goods inside ... Including some of the young and handsome humans in cages. At this moment, they were also being sold and sold on the shelves.There were many people walking on the streets ... Or perhaps, they were not humans.However, the human body and human form were also what some demons and chaos beasts liked to use as incarnations. It was more convenient and convenient.The fire Phoenix World had become a perfect, complete trading place.In this place, one could trade anything they wanted.There were even endless shops ahead. Here, you only had to pay a Dao crystal to get a shop. It didn't matter if you wanted to trade, show your face, or not show your face.Here, the fire Phoenix realm can guarantee your safety.It could also ensure that the items you wanted to trade would not be stolen.Even Li Hao was shocked. In the three regions, including Tian Fang, he had never seen such a perfect city for experts to trade. No one could guarantee the safety of the guests.What the human race couldn't do, the chaos beasts did.Even if it was only in the inner realm!Li Hao became even more solemn.Kong Ji frowned as well. There were also Trading Places in the divine light plane, but they were all people from the inner world. If they were to trade with people from the outer world, they had to be careful. It was very dangerous. The Hui long temple had also had such Trading Places.However, the most precious was only a small world. Ten million great Dao crystals were the peak.But here ... There were even transactions in mid-tier worlds.In the next moment, their line of sight turned to a shop next to them. This shop was closed, and there were some things imprinted on the door."Looking to purchase a seventh-order world, a universe containing the great Dao! If there are any traders, we can discuss the conditions inside!" Even Li Hao wanted to gasp.F * ck!​ There were still people trading here for a level 7 world?  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Is that true?In a rank 7 world, a rank 7 master was a true Overlord-level existence in the entire four-sided region. Even though he was not as strong as those rank 8 Masters, a rank 7 master was still an existence as rare as Phoenix Feathers and Qilin horns. Who would want to buy a world?Of course......Chaos beasts, maybe ..... They really know how to trade.Because the Beasts of Chaos didn't need the great Dao universe.Li Hao's heart trembled. Those who wanted to buy it were at least at the peak of the sixth step, or even the seventh step. Otherwise, there was no need to buy it, nor did they have the capital to do so.As soon as he entered the city, Li Hao was shocked.Someone was actually trading a tier 7 world here!Was it just to attract attention, or had someone really succeeded here?He did not know.At this moment, a human-shaped cultivator suddenly appeared beside him and chuckled,""I saw that fellow Daoist had been observing for a while. Could it be that ... You have some resources that can be traded from a rank seven world? If you do, you can go inside and talk about it in detail ..."Heibao looked at the man. Li Hao's voice sounded."You are ...""This is the trading shop set up by my master. It has been set up for 1000 years, and I'm in charge of it. If any senior is willing to talk about it, you can come in ... My master is very powerful, so if you have any requests, you can ask ..."That cultivator seemed to be a real human and not a demonic beast or Chaos Beast in human form.His strength ... Was not weak!Rank four venerable sovereign!A middle-grade venerable sovereign was guarding a small shop. He was not a simple person. Moreover ... There was a small Golden Dragon appearing on his forehead. Li Hao instantly realized that this was the human recognized by the dragon world, as the Phoenix had said.Li Hao quickly said,"if there's a level 7 world, wouldn't he be an idiot to trade it?" If I have it, I can refine it myself. Even if I don't reach the seventh tier, the sixth tier won't be a problem ... Who would trade for a seventh tier world?"The cultivator was a little disappointed, but he wasn't dejected. He smiled and said,""Fellow Daoist, you're right. However ... Anything is possible. A few years ago, Fire Phoenix City traded for a seventh-tier world. It's a pity that there's no great Dao universe. My master wanted to buy it, but the price was too high and not worth it. A seventh-tier world without a great Dao universe doesn't meet our expectations either ... However, this also means that it can still be bought in Fire Phoenix City."This human was rather talkative.He wasn't very talkative, but seeing that the Black Panther Li Hao had possessed kept staring at him, and that the other party was a level five venerable sovereign ... He came over to try and talk.If it was a low level venerable sovereign, he would not bother to say anything.Even if it was a strong master's servant, the servant that could take out a seventh-rank world and speak to him would be a middle-level one. Therefore, there was nothing to talk about with a low-level venerable sovereign, unless it was a seventh-rank son."Are there really people who want to trade for a rank 7 world?"

Chapter 3166 Let's Sign The Contract (2)
Li Hao was extremely surprised."Of course!"The cultivator laughed again. His smile was like a spring breeze and he looked gentle. At this moment, he explained, "It's normal. To the chaos race, a seventh-level venerable sovereign with a seventh-level universe is useless if he can't enter the eighth-level and has a second one. If he can exchange it for some treasures, it's better than keeping two great path universes.""In the entire four regions, only the fire Phoenix City would have someone who would dare to make such a bid and trade here without fear of being schemed against ... Here, the fire Phoenix realm Lord, a peak level rank seven expert, is enough to suppress all evildoers. Furthermore, the dragon world is nearby ...""Fellow Daoist, have you just arrived at Fire Phoenix City?"The Black Panther nodded its big head, cooperating with Li Hao very well.Li Hao didn't say anything. At this moment, he was even more shocked. In terms of business and civilization, the three regions were the most barren land. This was the first time he had seen the world of the rat monsters. Li Hao thought it was chaotic, but it turned out that it was not the case.Only some of the weaker worlds were in chaos. This place, on the other hand, was very developed.Li Hao glanced at the shop and didn't ask who the owner was. It was at least a peak sixth-level Beast of Chaos, and there was a high chance that it was a seventh-level Beast of Chaos.He was just about to ask the Black Panther to leave and continue on.The human cultivator suddenly said,"fellow Daoist should be a member of the chaos race who travels the chaos. My master doesn't just buy seventh-tier worlds. If ... Fellow Daoist encounters the coordinates of some seventh-tier worlds in the other three regions along the way and can provide you with the specific strength of some experts ... You can also trade!"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. This ... What was he doing?Would he dare to go to the three regions to seize a rank seven world?  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Some rank 7 macro worlds were so low-key that one would get goosebumps. One might not even know of the existence of this world. Under coincidences, some cultivators might discover it. Clearly, the other party had said this in hopes of providing some unknown macro worlds to others. They might want to take them.He was very bold!At this moment, Li Hao even suspected that there might be more than one seventh rank venerable sovereign behind this. Otherwise, how could they dare to take over the seventh rank world?"I've seen a few Level-7 worlds ... I don't know their exact strength, but they have some reputation. Is this okay?"When the cultivator heard this, he was still smiling, but he was a little disappointed.""It's possible ... But ... The value isn't high. If you can provide me with the location of a great world that is not well-known or even unknown to outsiders, as long as the information is true and can be confirmed, fellow Daoist can even get a medium-level world as a reward!"Just by providing information, he could obtain a medium-level world.Li Hao was speechless. He was really F * cking rich.Most importantly, it was rare to encounter such a world."That's a pity ... I'm quite strong, but I don't dare to run around. If I really encounter such a great world, it'll be difficult for me to survive!"The human cultivator didn't say anything else.Li Hao didn't say anything else. The Black Panther continued to move forward.As for the human cultivator, he looked at it silently. He had the strength of a Tier 5 itinerant cultivator. Judging from his aura and his steps ... He might have a world inside. Did he swallow a world and not digest it? was he preparing to cultivate his own world? It was also possible to tell whether a beast of primordial chaos had an inner world.Those with rich experience could see through it with a glance."An inner world ... Then it's probably not the heavenly Hound, right?"The human cultivator thought to himself. Of course, this was only a preliminary guess.There was only one World for neo martial, and it was in the body of the gray cat.As for the great worlds and medium worlds that the other party had broken through, there were traces of them.He was here to guard the shop, to buy and to sell. Of course, it was also true that he was here to gather some information.p No delay!If someone could trade for a rank 7 world, that would be for the best. As for the price, that had nothing to do with him.……At this moment, Li Hao frowned and said to Kong Tong,""The master of this human is not simple! Judging from his manner of speech, his temperament, and his Taoist connotation, this person should be a cultivation genius. And from the looks of it, he was not a vulgar person, and the Dao he cultivated was not the Dao of chaos. To be able to subdue such a fourth stage venerable sovereign or cultivate such a human world's venerable sovereign ... The person behind this must not be ordinary. If it's a human, then forget it. But if it's a beast of primordial chaos ..."Li Hao didn't say anything else.It was not simple!To be able to break some of the established ideologies and nurture the geniuses and experts of the human race, and to be able to convince the human race to submit to him, addressing him as 'master' without any difficulty at all, even in front of outsiders ... From the small to the big ... This was even more terrifying.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt that he was trapped in the Dragon field and couldn't extricate himself.This place was much more dangerous than he had expected.He might have underestimated the Dragon field!It wasn't just him. The four regions and the other three regions might have underestimated this place. Moreover, not all of the humans here were resisting. Some of them might have been completely subdued. It wasn't what he had expected. The humans in all the worlds were resisting and suffering.If the Dragon Lord was truly wise ... Perhaps he would deliberately show some oppression of the human race for others to see. In secret, perhaps ... He had subdued a large number of human powerhouses.Thinking of this, he shuddered a little."Brother kongji ... Did your father make any judgment on that person?""Yes, I did."Kong Ji thought for a moment and said,"they're powerful, their Dao techniques are profound, and they're unparalleled in their dominance ... Of course, due to their status, the Dragon field can't continue to expand. After all, there are limited chaos beasts in the square region." It can live in a corner without the capital to compete for hegemony in the four-sided region ..."

Chapter 3167 Let's Sign The Contract_ 3
Why wasn't there any?Because the other party was a Beast of Chaos, it was destined that he could not become the Overlord of the four-direction region. There were many level eights in the human race. Whoever won would not be the Dragon Lord.This was the light Thearch's judgment.Li Hao listened in silence. Of course, he was only listening. "Brother kongji, I think we've hit a wall this time!"Kong Ji nodded his head and sighed silently. I felt it too.He was thinking that these chaos beasts were uncouth and brainless. They only knew how to fight and kill. With a little scheme, it would be easy to kill a level Seven here. With a little stimulation, even a level Seven would dare to chase out of the world and be easily killed on the spot.But now ... He didn't think so.We might have overestimated ourselves.Li Hao kept rubbing his temples. This trip was not in vain. After successfully attacking the four worlds, he had underestimated the people of the world. He thought that even the red moon Lord was not that great. It would be easy for a boorish man like the Dragon Lord to scheme against him.But now he discovered...He had to be careful not to get himself killed.Not to mention anything else, just in this fire Phoenix City, any human he met was not simple. In fact, they did not communicate much. Just a few simple words had revealed many things.For example, he knew that Black Panther was an itinerant cultivator who had traveled the chaos and might have been to the other three regions ... He didn't know if it was information provided by an expert from the fire Phoenix realm or if the other party had seen through it.No matter what, he was not ordinary.Unless he knew all the middle-stage venerable sovereigns among the Beasts of Chaos, how could he be sure that the Black Panther was not from the Dragon field?Just as he was thinking, two beasts of primordial chaos who seemed to be in cahoots with each other were walking towards him from the opposite side. At this moment, they were whispering to each other,""It's said that the Crimson sun region is in chaos. Neo martial and the Crimson sun World have officially started a war ... I don't know if the Dragon region will participate or not. Once the Dragon Lord appears, that so-called human King, who is only at the seventh tier, can be killed by the Dragon Lord with one palm ... Should we go and take advantage of it?""You're going to die?"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Looking for death? How could that be? you don't believe in the Dragon Lord? "By the way, there seems to be some movement in Dragon World recently. They want to recruit some strong people. I suspect it's prepared to deal with neo martial. Should we try it?""To the dragon world?""There's no need to go to the dragon world. There's a recruitment point here in Fire Phoenix City. If you want to go, we can go together ... When we get there, the world can be devoured as much as we want. It's so chaotic right now anyway, and no one will care. The Lord of crimson sun can't even save himself, so why would he care about others?""That's a good thing ... It's a rare opportunity. Let's go take a look and see if we can get to know some of the powerful beings in the dragon world ..."The two beasts of Chaos were both third level venerable sovereigns, and they were both in human form. At this moment, they were chatting as they walked behind Li Hao.Li Hao was interested when he heard about neo martial. Had neo martial and Chi Yang officially started a war?He wasn't sure about this.Also, there was a recruitment point here in the dragon world. Was it recruiting venerable sovereigns? was it going to officially join the war?That was a good thing!It might not be a good thing for neo martial arts, but it was a good thing for him. He wanted to go up and ask ... But suddenly stopped. He looked at Kong Ji, who was also listening. Seeing Li Hao look at him, Kong Ji said, "It's still a new martial force. It looks like they've already started fighting ... Do you think we can sneak in and backstab the other party since the dragon world is recruiting experts?"Li Hao frowned slightly and glanced at Kong Ji.""You want to sneak in?""If that's the case, it's not a bad idea to sneak in if we don't have anything else to do. After all, neo martial arts is one of us, and we've even worked with venerable the sword before ..."Li Hao thought for a moment.If they were in the same group as the new martial artists, of course, they would be interested when they heard this. If they had nothing else to do, if they could really blend in, not only could they get benefits, but they might also be able to help the new martial artists to attack from both sides at a critical moment.They could even pay attention to the whereabouts of the dragon world and lock onto its location. If the Dragon Master participated in the war, he would be able to blend in and provide more help to new martial.But ...Li Hao frowned slightly. He couldn't say what was wrong, but he felt that ... When these two venerable sovereigns passed by him and mentioned neo martial arts, they suddenly felt that neo martial arts were everywhere and could be heard everywhere. Did low-level venerable sovereigns pay attention to the powerful human King?Even in the other three regions, ordinary low-level venerable sovereigns did not care much about the battle between powerful worlds. They could not participate and gain any benefits.Be careful not to lose your life!Li Hao didn't say anything. The Black Panther continued to walk forward. Soon, a lot of people had gathered in front of them. There were also some demonic beasts and Beasts of Chaos who didn't transform into human forms. They maintained their original appearance, but they were much smaller.At this moment, they were all gathered in front of a shop.Li Hao was also curious. Soon, he ordered the Black Panther to move forward. The Black Panther was not weak and was not small, so it quickly squeezed to the front. Some of the experts in the surroundings did not dare to stand in the way when they saw a level five venerable sovereign. The group of venerable sovereigns gathered like ordinary people to watch the show.At this moment, Li Hao also saw some words on the door of the shop."Recently, an expert found a golden-bodied, single-horned, mutated demon near the Dragon field. It cultivates the Dao of Thunder and the Dao of devouring. It has leopard spots on its body, and its strength is between level three and level four ... He's buying this mutated demon at a high price. One level-five medium-level world, 100 million great Dao crystals, and 100 level-seven fire-type Dao accumulation crystals ..."

Chapter 3168 Let's Sign The Contract (3)
The price was a little too high.How could a third or fourth rank demonic beast be worth this price?A rank 5 world was definitely enough, and this was if he was sure that the other party was at rank 4. Otherwise, he would not even need a rank 5 world.No wonder so many people were watching!Anyone with some ability would probably be tempted by this deal, especially when there was a Dao accumulation crystal. This thing could only be found at the seventh-grade, so its value was even more expensive.Li Hao didn't react for a moment.Kong Ji was even more surprised that the Beasts of Chaos were rich. The Black Panther, on the other hand, looked a little confused, but it didn't think much of it. Li Hao didn't say anything, so it didn't have any other thoughts.However ... Looking at the description, he felt that it was somewhat familiar.As for Li Hao, he seemed to have come back to his senses. After a while, he was stunned for a moment before he said,""This ... What?"The demon subduing envoy!Heibao's ancestor?Of course, the ancestor of the ancestor was the heavenly Hound.Looking at this description, it seemed to be a little similar to the impression he had of the Leviathan he had seen when he was wandering around neo martial arts that day. Black Panther had actually condensed a Leviathan before.Li Hao was stunned for a moment. The church was built near the Dragon field?He knew that many neo martial artists went out, but they were not strong. According to the description, they were only at the third or fourth rank. It was said that they were not even venerable sovereigns back then. It was amazing to be at the third or fourth rank now.What was it doing nearby?The next moment ... He was stunned again. Frowning, Li Hao glanced at Kong Ji."It looks like a neo martial demon subduing envoy!"Kong Ji was stunned for a moment,'nearby? If someone offers such a high price to buy the other party, we'll be dead once we're discovered ..."Li Hao frowned. After a long time, he said,""Not good, are we being watched? "Not long after we entered the city, neo martial seemed to be surrounding us. They were dealing with neo martial and buying demon subduing envoys ..."He frowned. At this moment, he was really suspicious.Was there a problem?It can't be, right?Or was it just a normal test? but ... If every new venerable sovereign was tested like this, wouldn't the fire Phoenix realm be too idle?It was related to neo martial ...The demon subduing envoy!The next moment, Li Hao patted his head, feeling a little depressed. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry."I know, it's a dog!"Are you suspecting that the Black Panther is the heavenly Hound?The heavenly Hound was really strong. It could have really gone out. He didn't really care about that. But the next moment, he became serious. I didn't even know that the heavenly Hound had gone out. As soon as Black Panther entered the city, the other party immediately reacted and arranged a series of tests.This ... Also, devouring and Thunderbolts were the demon subduers 'specialty. Devouring was learned from the heavenly Hound, and Thunderbolts were naturally born. The other party was just an unknown neo martial Supreme Emperor. However, did they really find him or ... Did they have information on him?The ability of a demon suppressor was not a secret in neo martial, but neo martial was a secret to the entire chaos. Other than a group of top experts who were known to the public, the rest were notorious ones like heaven pole and King Huai. A demon suppressor could only be said to be neither high nor low. They did not have much fame at all!"Brother Kong Ji, we might really be in big trouble!"At this moment, Li Hao felt a deep sense of danger. However, the moment he arrived and appeared as a dog, the other party immediately thought of the heavenly Hound and arranged a series of tests. Only the master of this place, the fire Phoenix realm master, had such an ability.So, we're being watched. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t   A seventh level venerable sovereign was staring at them.F * ck, if I had known earlier, I wouldn't have let the Black Panther turn into a dog. It would have been fine if it had turned into a bull.Miscalculated!Of course, if he turned into a dog, he would have the same habits as a Black Panther and would be easy to adapt to. If he turned into an ox, there might be many flaws and perhaps even more danger."This is going to be interesting!"As Li Hao thought of this, he quickly sent a message to Black Panther: "Before we came in, didn't we tell the fire Phoenix that we wanted to join the dragon world?"The Black Panther wagged its tail. Right, I think I said it.Li Hao frowned. If that was the case ... He shouldn't have reacted like this when the other party mentioned that he could join the dragon world. He shouldn't have been so indifferent. After all, he had come here to join the dragon world.He had really seen a ghost!He didn't care, and he didn't care either ...At this moment, Kong Ji also came back to his senses. He hadn't paid much attention to it before, but now that he realized where the trouble was, he quickly sent a message. "We're being watched?""Yes,""It's so troublesome. Even if we enter the divine world of light, it's difficult for us to grasp something in an instant when an unfamiliar venerable sovereign enters ... The fire Phoenix World has set their eyes on us so quickly. Not to mention other things, their intelligence system is impressive, and they know a lot about neo martial. However, neo martial has only been in the chaos for a short time. He has only been famous for more than 50 years. He was only known by the chaos because he took the initiative to start a war with the Crimson Moon ..."Li Hao nodded. That's right.It had only been 50 years.A rank-7 world had instantly obtained information about some unknown venerable sovereigns in neo martial world. It would take time to spread the news.This meant that the other party had been staring at neo martial.Where did he get the courage?Or perhaps, it wasn't the fire Phoenix World, but the dragon world."We can't stay here for long!"Li Hao quickly sent a voice transmission."But before we came in, I might have said something wrong. I said that I wanted to join the dragon world. If we leave now and run around instead of going to the dragon world ... We'll be more likely to be targeted!" But if we don't leave, it'll be dangerous here ..."Of course, it was a little safer than the dragon world.Many thoughts emerged in his mind. Ever since he had defeated the Four Realms, he no longer liked to overestimate his opponents. At this moment, his mind was working quickly.

Chapter 3169 Let's Sign The Contract (3)
"Black Panther, stop looking. Let's go, we'll ask someone where we can buy a rank-6 world. Rank-6 Water-type worlds are the best!"Although the Black Panther didn't quite understand what Li Hao meant, it didn't care. After looking at the brand on the shop for a while, it didn't pay much attention to it. Soon, it patted a brawny man next to it with its paw. It didn't care about the other party's race, as he wasn't as strong as it was."Where can I find a level 6 world? a Water-type world ..." Li Hao quickly asked.The brawny man who was hit was only a second level venerable sovereign. Seeing a fifth level venerable sovereign staring at him, although he was not afraid of the other party's attack, he did not dare to be too presumptuous. He hurriedly replied,""It's very rare to see a rank 6 world ... And there are attribute requirements, which are even rarer ... Under normal circumstances, one would have to wait for a long time and depend on luck. However, if one is in urgent need, one can go to the fire Phoenix Pavilion and ask. That is the fire Phoenix world's own shop. They can send out missions, make requests, or ask the other party to help them find it ... But the price is not cheap ...""Where are you?""It's right in front!"Li Hao didn't ask any more questions. The Black Panther swaggered forward.……In the sky.The golden-haired girl was also looking down at the entire city. After a while, she looked at her mother and said with uncertainty,""Is it the heavenly Hound?""What do you think?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The fire Phoenix master asked with a smile.The golden-haired girl shook her head."It's not easy to judge. However, according to our understanding, if it's the heavenly Hound ... The kun is its descendant, and it's also the demon subduing envoy of neo martial arts. It should care! Also, if the other party knows that the dragon world is going to deal with neo martial, they might join the ranks of venerable sovereigns recruited by the dragon world ...""Or maybe he's just pretending not to care."The firephoenix master laughed."Of course. We'll just have to wait and see. There's no rush. Also ... Although the heavenly Hound is stupid, you've been too hasty. You've tested it out repeatedly. Be careful not to be detected by the other party. "However, if it's not the heavenly Hound, you won't think much of it. This dog clan's venerable sovereign can be a small target for your next observation ... If the other party is really the heavenly Hound, capturing the new martial arts heavenly Hound will be a great merit! If not, then it's fine, I'll just treat it as a training experience. ""Many thanks, mother!"The fire Phoenix master did not say anything. He stood up and smiled."You should continue to observe. There are people from the Thunder World who have entered the city. Recently, the Thunder region has been peaceful. It seems that some experts from the other regions have entered the square region from the Thunder region and made some contact with the Thunder World. That's a good thing. If there really are experts from other regions ... That might be our chance!""A chance?"The golden-haired girl was slightly confused, and fire Phoenix master explained,""The master of the Thunder World is very wary of us. However, he won't be too wary of experts from other regions. He even hopes that he can obtain some support! All these years, we have sealed off the Thunder World and the Thunder World is lacking in resources. We have taken away some of the primal Chaos energy near the Thunder World. The other party lacks resources. Even if he doesn't have the support of experts, he still hopes that he can obtain the support of some great Dao crystals, monarch weapons, and Dao accumulation crystals. " "In that case ... The other party might let some powerful cultivators from the outer realm into the realm or leave the realm to trade with them. In the past, we have secretly traded with them in Fire Phoenix City, but this is far from enough ..." The fire Phoenix Sector Lord laughed,"I can even determine how many venerable sovereigns there are in the Thunder World. There's one seventh-ranked venerable sovereign, four to five sixth-ranked venerable sovereigns, less than 20 fourth and fifth-ranked venerable sovereigns, and at most 30 low-level venerable sovereigns ... Furthermore, they're all in a state of energy deficiency!"There were less than 60 venerable sovereigns in total, or even fewer.All of this was determined from the great Dao crystals and other resources that the other party had secretly traded. The fire Phoenix realm's use was not just for trade. She had information on the entire Dragon field, including the territories of the demons.The golden-haired girl's eyes were filled with joy."Then what mother means is ... This time, we have a high chance of truly taking over the Thunder region!""That's right. That's why we don't need to waste too much energy on that dog. Of course, you can play with it first. The Thunder World is our next most important mission!"The fiery phoenix master laughed."I'll go and take a look. If you still think it's inappropriate, you can go and get in touch with this dog yourself. A fifth rank venerable sovereign is worth our fiery phoenix realm roping in. It's not too sudden.""I know."The fire Phoenix master did not say anything more and quickly left.Even if the rank 6 heavenly Hound was here, it would not be able to compare to a rank 7 world. Once the Thunder World was removed, the entire human race's resistance in the Dragon field would disappear instantly. The human race's influence in this place would be completely removed.Over the years, they had allowed many human traitors to enter the Thunder World. If they were to capture all of them in one fell swoop, it wouldn't just be a problem of a single major world. It would also be a problem of ruling the entire Dragon field. The human powerhouses they would support would replace the Thunder world's position and instantly become the spiritual pillar of the Dragon field's humans!At that time, there would be no voice of opposition in the Dragon field. As for the major demon worlds, negotiations could be made. After all, the Beasts of Chaos and the demon race were passed down from the same lineage.The human race was the biggest enemy of the four-sided domain.……At this moment, Li Hao had already arrived at the fire Phoenix Pavilion in the fire Phoenix realm.A venerable sovereign received Heibao in person.When Black Panther made his request, the venerable sovereign who received him felt a little embarrassed. Soon, he seemed to have received some news and said quickly,""Sir, the deal in a rank 6 world is too big, I can't make the decision! The fire Phoenix Pavilion is under the control of the princess of the fire Phoenix realm, the Phoenix Flame Thearch! It's rare to see a trade in a rank six world, even in the fire Phoenix realm. If you really need it, you can inform Princess Feng Yan and come to you!"
