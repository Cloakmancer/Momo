master had killed all of their people.
 Now that Yuan Shuo had escaped, no matter what, Zi Yue had to give an explanation to the powerhouses from the central region who were about to arrive.
 Her tone was calm, but it seemed to hide her thunderous anger.""Just because I don't want to fall out with you night patrollers at this moment doesn't mean you can shield the five birds sect!"
 Hao lianchuan cursed in his heart.
 Where's the Minister?
 Why isn't he here yet?
 Ziyue was very strong, and she might even be stronger than sun Yifei.
 The red moon had seven leaders. They were red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. The red moon was Ying Hongyue. The purple Moon was ranked seventh, but it did not necessarily represent its strength. After all, this was not the first generation of the purple Moon.
 However, his status was very high.
 This also meant that Crimson Moon still valued Silver Moon.
  It was not only the red moon, but also the other organizations.
 The key was that many masters had come from the Silver Moon martial forest ... Of course, this was the reason in the past, but now it seemed that it was also related to the eight great families.
 In any case, Hao lianchuan knew that he was no match for this person. Even with the help of the fire Phoenix spear, he would not be able to defeat him. This was because the purple Moon must have an origin divine weapon!
 There weren't many origin God weapons, but some provinces would have a few.
 Origin God weapons were also divided into strong and weak ones. Some origin God weapons had special effects, such as the one in the central continent. An offensive origin god weapon was less valuable, but an important figure like Zi Yue would definitely have one!
 "Ziyue!"
 Hao lianchuan said in a deep voice,"we'll talk about it when the Minister is here!" If I can't make the decision, don't even think about snatching it from me. Otherwise, when the Minister arrives, Red Moon and the night patrollers will definitely go to war!"
 Zi Yue looked at him coldly and said,"so what if we start a war?" Are you threatening me? Now, haokong, Duan Tian, and sun Yifei are all dead ... How am I going to answer to them if I can't take Li Hao with me? Since it's troublesome no matter what ... Then let's make it even more chaotic!"
 Then, she reached out to grab Li Hao!
 He opened his palm, and the lightning was like a prison!
 It was as if he could cover the sky with one hand. In an instant, he brought everyone immense pressure.
 This woman had actually made a move.
 Hao lianchuan was furious. With a roar, he threw a punch and Heavenly Fire exploded. With a loud boom, Hao lianchuan was forced to retreat. His palm was covered in lightning. With a loud boom, his arm was continuously blown apart.
 Zi Yue, however, was as still as a mountain. She attacked Li Hao again.
 The first reason they captured Li Hao was because of Yuan Shuo.
 Secondly ... It was naturally because of his identity, the successor of the eight great families.
 Ziyue knew that as long as she captured Li Hao this time, she might be able to atone for her crimes and not be punished when she returned. However, if she could not capture Li Hao, she would be in trouble.
 Too many experts had died in the Silver Moon division under her leadership.
 A few of the three suns had died, including sun Yifei who had just arrived.
 One had to know that many provinces did not have three suns.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Some of the less important provinces only had the sunlit Empire in charge. Silver Moon had sent several three suns experts because of the eight great families and because of hou Xiaochen, but now she was the only one left. The higher-ups were probably going crazy with anger.
  ……  In the crowd, Li Hao was expressionless.
 He just watched as this woman attacked again and again, but Hao lianchuan stopped her every time.
 Catch me?
 He wasn't afraid of death, or rather, he wasn't afraid of dying now, because the purple Moon wouldn't kill him now.
 The silver Blizzard city's matter wasn't over yet. The gossip was still there, and the stone gate was still there ...
 Red Moon might have known all this.
 They still needed him. They even had to wait for the next rainy season to extract his bloodline. They wouldn't kill him now.
 He only remembered this person.
 Also, if Zi Yue was here, what about hou Xiaochen?
 At this time, the other sunlit cultivators also made their moves. One sunlit cultivator was naturally not a match for the three suns, but with many sunlit cultivators attacking, the scene suddenly became chaotic.
 "Hmph!" Zi Yue snorted coldly. It seemed like something was about to surge out of her body.
 Li Hao watched in silence. He saw that an unknown beast was about to come out of Zi Yue's body. It should be an origin weapon.
 In a short time, he had already seen several origin God weapons.
 He glanced at Zhang Ting, who was also hiding in the crowd ...
 This mid-stage three yang expert, who might have come from the central region and was holding an origin divine weapon, chose to Dodge at this moment.
 Beside Li Hao, Liu Long didn't make a move.
 He simply protected Li Hao behind him.
 Yuan Shuo was gone. He was the one who brought Li Hao here. At this moment, he was Li Hao's last layer of protection, even though he was only an ordinary Qian warrior and not a martial arts expert like Yuan Shuo.
 Li Hao's heart warmed. Not everyone was like Zhang Ting at this moment.
 Hao lianchuan and the others were all taking action. Even though they only needed to hand him over, these people still did not compromise. After all, the night patrolmen still had some dignity and courage.
  Just as the lightning Beast was about to appear, Ziyue suddenly stopped her attack and took a few steps back.
 A moment later, two figures slowly walked over from the distance.
 A man and a woman.
 Li Hao recognized the man. It was hou Xiaochen.
 The woman was unfamiliar. Her face was cold, and she was holding onto hou Xiaochen as they walked over.
 Hao lianchuan, on the other hand, was overjoyed!
 "Marquis!"
 Minister hou is here!
 As for chief Yu, no one greeted her. She had been taking care of hou Xiaochen for many years, and as for whether or not she had some sort of relationship with hou Xiaochen ... No one cared.
 Hou Xiaochen had no family, and neither was he married, so they didn't care about their relationship.

 Zi Yue also looked at hou Xiaochen. Even though he looked sickly and needed someone to help him, no one would underestimate him.
 This was the Super powerful man who had killed a three-sun powerful man in front of Ying Hongyue back then.
 At that time, Ying Hongyue should have already broken through to the rising light realm.
 However, he still killed a three-Sun Expert in front of everyone. This showed how strong hou Xiaochen was.
 "Hou Xiaochen!" He called out.
 Ziyue also spoke with a cold tone,""The night patrolman is too meddlesome. Do you want to protect Yuan Shuo's disciple too?"
 Hou Xiaochen chuckled,"Li Hao is a Night Watcher, right?"
 "Yes!" Hao lianchuan said hurriedly from a distance.
 "That's good enough. "
 He looked at Ziyue and smiled,"alright, don't be angry." Purple Moon third generation, wait for your Red moon's experts to come before saying this. You're alone ... Why are you looking for trouble?"
  Zi Yue's eyes were cold!
 "What are you looking at me for?" hou Xiaochen laughed. I'm not afraid of you. Even if I'm not as good as I was in the past, I'm not afraid of you, little girl. I killed the second generation Zi Yue in front of Ying Hongyue. You don't want me to replace Zi Yue, do you?"
 Ziyue's expression changed slightly when she heard this.
 That's right, the one who was killed back then was the second generation Zi Yue!
 Now that it was mentioned, Ziyue's expression turned ugly.
 However, it was also true that he was worried about hou Xiaochen.
 In the distance, a figure could be seen. Hou Xiaochen looked over and chuckled,"Huanhuan, is the Yama also going to get involved? The Yama didn't suffer any losses this time, but the Crimson Moon suffered heavy losses. Do you want to be like the Crimson Moon?"
 In the distance, a faint laughter came,"that's not what I meant, the Marquis has misunderstood!" He had only come to take a look after sensing the energy fluctuations. Since the Marquis has come, we will take our leave!"
 As soon as he finished speaking, several figures disappeared in the distance.
 Hou Xiaochen calmly walked over and said,"Ziyue, Banshan from the flying heavens hasn't appeared until today. Have you had any contact with him? Where did he go? Is he hiding, or is he in seclusion, preparing for a breakthrough?"
 Zi Yue looked at him coldly. The next moment, she disappeared in a flash like lightning.
 He didn't want to say anything more to hou Xiaochen.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't mind and shook his head,"Young man, you're really talented, but unfortunately ... You're a little rude. I'm her benefactor, after all. Shouldn't she thank me for being promoted to the third generation Purple Moon?"
 Silence.
 "Department head, what took you so long?" Hao lianchuan asked after a while.
 He came a little later than the others!
 Hou Xiaochen looked at him and smiled, "I'm sick and I walk slowly. Don't you know that?"
 “……”
 Alright, an impeccable reason.
 But ... That was bullshit!
 Even if he was injured, he shouldn't be in this state. It was common for experts to have injuries. Even if he wasn't fully recovered, he wouldn't look so sick. At most, his strength would be slightly damaged.
 At this moment, the others also started shouting excitedly.  "The Minister is here!"
 "Let's see if Ziyue still dares to be so arrogant. The Minister is here, she has no right to be arrogant!"
 ……
 On Li Hao's side, Liu Long also glanced at hou Xiaochen. He lowered his voice and said,"Stop talking! This person ... Is not an ordinary person, and he is not as easy to talk to as Hao bu. "
 He dared to joke around with Hao lianchuan and even lie to him. However, hou Xiaochen was like a shadow in a tree.
 His reputation had already spread far and wide just from his resistance against Ying Hongyue many years ago. Even his enemy, Zi Yue, had quickly fled when she saw him coming, not daring to stay for long.
 Li Hao did not say anything.
 He only looked at the man. His hair was a little long, as if it hadn't been taken care of for some time. He looked a little sick, and he wasn't too big, even slightly shorter than Li Hao.
 He was wearing a navy blue uniform, which was slightly brighter than the black that Li Hao and the others were wearing.
 He looked like he was in his thirties.
 But Li Hao knew that this person should be over 40 years old.
 As for whether he was under 50 years old, he was not sure. Anyway, he did not look as young as he appeared.
 He had a weak smile on his face, and with his sickly face, he looked very gentle.
 However, it was this person who said that he would become independent at worst just last night!
 He observed hou Xiaochen, who also looked at Li Hao. Hou Xiaochen walked toward Li Hao with a smile on his face."Yuan Shuo's disciple? The successor of the Li family?"
 Very few people mentioned the eight great families.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But today, hou Xiaochen had said it out loud.
 Li Hao lowered his head."I'm a member of the five birds sect. As for the eight great families ... I'm not too sure. I've only heard of them. Red Moon seems to think I'm one, but I'm not sure about the details."
 "En, not bad!" Hou Xiaochen nodded and smiled.
 After saying that, he looked at Hao lianchuan and said,"send someone to Yama, flying heavens, and swords gate. Invite their leaders over. If they don't come now, then we will open the ruins ourselves tomorrow and enter!"
 "Now?"
  "Now!"
 "Alright!"
 Hao lianchuan immediately arranged for people to invite the leaders of the families to discuss this matter.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything else. He glanced at Li Hao and said,"Do you have time to accompany me to the previous battlefield?"
 "The bridge?"
 Li Hao asked.
 Hou Xiaochen nodded.
 "This way please, Minister!" Li Hao hurriedly said.
 Since hou Xiaochen wanted to see it, he had no reason to refuse.
 The others wanted to follow, but hou Xiaochen waved his hand and had chief Yu support him as he followed Li Hao back to the battlefield.

 They didn't have much to say on the way.
 ……
 Li Hao was very curious about hou Xiaochen, but he restrained himself.
 He didn't say what he shouldn't say, and he didn't ask what he shouldn't ask.
 Today, he was only above 100, but the other party was the leader of the night patrols. The status of the two parties was not equal, and the gap was huge.
 After walking for a while, they arrived at the battlefield.
 Hou Xiaochen looked at the grave in the distance, then at the sky.
 A moment later, he coughed lightly and suddenly rose into the air.
 He strolled in the air as if he was taking a leisurely stroll. Sometimes, he would reach out and grab the air, as if he was feeling the battle from before.
 A moment later, he landed on the ground.
  "The old demon Yuan of the past didn't fall into silence after all. He stepped into the Qian warrior realm in one day, and then the spirit accumulation realm in a few days. The integration of the five birds is indeed impressive!"
 "The fire in the heart nurtures the ape, the water in the kidney nurtures the Tiger ... In other words, the spirit accumulation is the spirit of the five internal organs?" Using the five powers as a God and accumulating a God of the five powers?"
 "But this ... Doesn't suit the others!"
 He had a good eye, but on second thought, this might be in line with Yuan Shuo's path, but it didn't mean it was in line with other martial masters.
 "If that's the case, the rise of a Martial Master ... Is just a dream. Just because one person is strong doesn't mean that all martial masters are strong!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hou Xiaochen shook his head,"not everyone can be a Martial Master like Yuan Shuo. Not everyone can accumulate Five Forces!" In order to accumulate the five Forces, he killed many people before he stepped into the fusion of the five Forces, and almost ended his path of Qian Douluo. "
 It seemed like no one else would be able to take this path!
 If that was the case ... Even though Yuan Shuo was strong, he wouldn't have caused such a huge commotion in the world.
 Hou Xiaochen seemed to be a little regretful.
 The powerful Yuan Shuo, if there was only one powerful person ... He didn't care too much about it.
 He even hoped that Yuan Shuo had really walked the path of Martial Master.
 All martial masters had hope.
 Even if thousand combat was a hurdle that eliminated countless people, the world was so big, and with the mysterious energy, martial masters improved even faster. There would definitely be people who could comprehend force, and many.
 At that time, anyone could become a spiritual accumulation cultivator, and that would be the prosperity of martial arts!
 "Yes." Li Hao lowered his head and said,"teacher has just reached this stage and is trying to popularize it."
 "What about you?" hou Xiaochen nodded and asked with a smile.
 "Me?"
 "That's right. You should have entered the warrior dimension as well. Although your Foundation is not as good as your teacher 's, I don't think you will be willing to stay in the warrior dimension for the rest of your life. What are your plans for your future?"
 "I'm still young ..."
 "He's 20 years old. He's not young anymore. "
 Hou Xiaochen laughed,"you should know that in the central region, there are already people who have reached the three suns realm at the age of 20!" With the rise of superpowers and the emergence of mysterious powers, it was easy for superpowers to level up and God tier Masters were even more so. Even a Martial Master could cultivate ten times easier with the help of the mysterious energy! I'm 20 years old, I should have some plans. "  "What's more, you're Yuan Shuo's student, the successor of the eight great families. If you don't become stronger, there will be a lot of trouble. "
 After saying that, he added,"there's one more thing. Everyone has their own value!" You're not my student, not my child. I'm willing to help you because you're a Night Watcher, but if the trouble you bring exceeds the value you bring, do you think a stranger will help you without any bottom line?"
 It was a very realistic sentence.
 Li Hao was silent for a while."Teacher is gone. Now, I'm the only one who knows the core inheritance of the five birds technique, including the process of teacher's spirit accumulation and the concept of spirit accumulation. I'm the only one who knows it."
 "Just this?"
 "If that's all there is to it," hou Xiaochen said disappointedly,"then it's worth paying attention to. If it's only for one person, then there's no need to pay too much attention to it."
 Li Hao fell silent again.
 After an unknown amount of time, when hou Xiaochen was about to leave, Li Hao suddenly said,"I am the successor of the eight great families!"
 “……”
 Hou Xiaochen laughed and turned to look at him."I thought you weren't sure?"
 "I'm sure!"
 Li Hao lowered his head and said embarrassedly,"my teacher told me not to say that in public, but I am!" The eight great families might have been extraordinary during the ancient civilization era, and might even be related to some top secrets and some ruins!"
 Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment before nodding, "It's barely enough, so let's do this!"
 ? Then, he walked towards the camp.
 Chief Steward Yu had been like an invisible person and had never spoken.
 Li Hao followed them in silence.
 He couldn't quite see through hou Xiaochen, or rather, he didn't dare to look at him.
 However, that chief Yu ... He could barely see through her. The huge sun had almost blinded his eyes.
 Hao lianchuan ... Was so pitiful!
 The first Deputy Minister? he's worse than a woman.
  This Chief Steward Yu was no small matter.
 However, the other party was willing to keep a low profile and become a housekeeper. From this, it could be seen that hou Xiaochen was the truly terrifying one.
 Thus, Li Hao kept his head low from the beginning to the end.
 He was afraid that if he lifted his head, he would be blinded by chief Yu before hou Xiaochen could even do so.
 Li Hao thought about many things, but he was more confused about hou Xiaochen.
 Why ... Did he not feel much power?
 Could it be that the other party was completely reserved?
 Or was he also a Martial Master?
 It shouldn't be, right?
 Many doubts appeared in Li Hao's mind, but he chose to stay quiet and walk with these astute big shots, pretending that he knew nothing.

 (Diarrhea. Men squat in the pit for half an hour. It's a little late, don't mind it.)
 Without his teacher by his side, Li Hao returned to his cautious state.
 There was no harm in being low-key in front of the big boss.
 If he was high-profile, he might be valued by hou Xiaochen, but ... Was there a need?
 He wasn't familiar with hou Xiaochen, nor did he have any feelings for him, so he didn't need him to value him.
 The only thing he needed was for hou Xiaochen to be able to help him resist some pressure for a short period of time. As for this, it wasn't a deal between him and hou Xiaochen, but an agreement between his teacher and hou Xiaochen.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Thus, Li Hao judged that hou Xiaochen's desire to show his value was not necessarily a matter of whether he would protect him or not.
 Would hou Xiaochen even hand him over?
 It won 't!
 If a person who claimed to be independent handed Li Hao over, the Nightwatchers would definitely be unstable. Even if everyone knew that handing Li Hao over would save them a lot of trouble, Li Hao was still a Nightwatcher, and this was something that could not be changed. Who would work for such a rebel if they handed over their own people in exchange for a temporary peace?
  Exposing any secret would only get him some resources at most, but he might have to pay an even greater price.
 This was Li Hao's measure.
 As such, he kept a low profile in front of hou Xiaochen and did not display anything special. As for his strength, it was likely that hou Xiaochen would not even consider him a threat.
 After all, he was no longer the yuan Shuo who had dominated his entire life.
 He was just a newcomer, Li Hao.
 Li Hao, who had comprehended sword force and terrain, was still in the period of strengthening his force. He was also trying to merge the two forces. Although he felt that he could break through at any time, Li Hao was not in a hurry.
 Now that he had stepped into the thousand warrior tier, he was only the next Liu Long.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't just want to become a Qian warrior.
 As for Li Hao, he would need to fuse at least two of his teacher's Five Forces. This way, he would be able to quickly become stronger after he entered the Qian Jin stage and be comparable to the late-stage or even peak of the sunlit stage, instead of only being able to defeat some early-stage sunlit cultivators after he entered the Qian Jin stage ... That would be a waste of time.
 Li Hao, who was walking at the back, was thinking about this.
 Then, he thought of the ruins.
 "The ruins should continue. Hou Xiaochen and the others won't let this go. If too many people pay attention to it, they won't have the chance. So, there's a high chance that there won't be any problems with tomorrow's trip to the ruins. It's just that the people who enter ..."
 After some consideration, he decided that there might be fewer or more powerful ones.
 If the others from the red moon died, would the purple Moon enter?
 At this moment, Li Hao even hoped that Zi Yue would go in. If she went in, she might have another helper at a critical moment ... The only reason was that Red Moon didn't want Li Hao to die in the remains.
 It all depended on whether Ying Hongyue had given such an order to Ziyue.
 "After entering the warrior dimension, I also need to quickly gather my spirit. Teacher has Five Forces, but I can first gather one force, the force of the sword or the force of the earth. This will require sufficient earth or metal energy."
 The sword belonged to gold, and the earth belonged to earth.
  His teacher, the heart fire ape, had absorbed the life force of a full three suns, which was more than a thousand cubic meters of fire energy.  Li Hao had absorbed some of it before, but he had to prepare at least 1000 cubes.
 At this moment, he was thinking about where he could get the thousands of cubic meters of earth energy or metal energy.
 "One three suns, or four or five sunlit cultivators."
 "Not to mention the Nightwalker, the only red Moon left is the purple Moon, the island of light has been destroyed, and the swords gate is still in a state of uncertainty, it's not easy to make a move ... Flying heavens or Yama? The Yama is the first target ..."
 He thought of Yama.
 The Yama was perhaps the most suitable for his goal.
 "There's no need to rush the water, but we can also prepare to strengthen it in advance. Zhang Ting is a suitable candidate."
 "As for the Yama, I know that li Dahu is an earth-type, but he's only in the early stage of the solar glory realm ... Their leader is also a three yang ..."
 Also, who knew if the reincarnation King would enter the ruins.
 His thoughts had long drifted away. It was clearly only over a hundred, but he had his eyes on the sunlit and even the three suns.
 Those who knew would probably think that he was crazy.
 "Li Hao!"
 Hou Xiaochen suddenly called out.
 "Department head!" Li Hao quickly stepped forward and lowered his head.
 Hou Xiaochen turned to look at him and smiled,"You seem to have a lot on your mind. Are you under any pressure?"
 Li Hao was startled. A heavy heart?
 I'm just thinking about it, you can't possibly see through this, right?
  ,m "No, I'm just a little worried about my teacher."  "Oh, Yuan Shuo ... Don't worry, he's been through a lot. He won't be caught up in such a small matter. Besides, since he's gone, he must have made some preparations."
 After saying that, hou Xiaochen continued,"Do you have any good ideas on how to extract and absorb the blood God?"
 Li Hao immediately said,"there's no good way. The department head will know how to extract the blood God's spawn." As for absorption ... That's even simpler. If a Martial Master absorbs it, there will definitely be an improvement. However, the ordinary breathing technique may have a lower absorption efficiency, but the breathing technique of five birds has a higher absorption efficiency. "
 "Is the efficiency low?"
 He fell into deep thought. After walking for a while, he said,""Would your teacher mind teaching the breathing technique of five birds?"
 "You can 't!"
 Li Hao shook his head,"teacher didn't say, so I don't know what he's thinking." However, teacher didn't say that I can't teach it to outsiders. "
 He didn't know what hou Xiaochen was planning, but he definitely couldn't teach the five birds breathing technique to anyone else.
 Of course, if his teacher's modification was successful and the breathing technique of five birds was effective in accumulating the five internal organs in the later stages, it would allow one to directly accumulate the five internal organs. Then, it would not be impossible to teach the current breathing technique.

 For example, when his teacher had created the breathing technique of five birds, he had taught the simple breathing technique to others, and Wang Ming and the others knew it.
 This was also the core of a Martial master's inheritance, so he had to keep it for now.
 Only the core disciples.
 He couldn't just pass on the core to others.
 "Yes."
 Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything else. As they walked, he asked,"Do you want to enter the remains tomorrow? The ruins are very dangerous. If you don't want to go in, then I won't force you. You can stay with me. "
 "The Minister isn't going?"
 "I'm not going. "
 "If I go in, the others won't dare to go in," hou Xiaochen laughed."I'm also afraid that if I go in and come out, the night patrol outside will be gone. "
 He could only stay outside and wait for the other experts to arrive.
  With him around, they could still be intimidated.
 If he were to enter and lose contact with them, the entire Silver Moon superpower system would be in chaos.
 "Where's chief Yu?"
 Li Hao asked again.
 "She's not going in either. "
 "She's just a Secretary,"hou Xiaochen chuckled,"she's not an expert. Do you really need someone to protect her?"
 On the side, a faint smile appeared on steward Yu's cold face.
 Li Hao nodded and didn't say anything.
 Whatever you say.
 ……
 After returning to the base, Li Hao didn't follow hou Xiaochen.
 He returned to his own tent.
 This morning, his teacher was still around, but now he was nowhere to be found. He didn't know if his injuries could be healed or not. Also, this time, he didn't know how many experts would target his teacher.
 Even though his teacher was very strong, the rise of superpowers, not to mention above three suns, even if there were a few more late stage three suns, his teacher would not be able to match them.
 In the past, with his teacher's protection, even if there were enemies or danger, he would still have some backing at the last moment.
 But now, who could he rely on?
 After returning to the tent, Li Hao sat on the simple stone bed and thought about everything.
 After a while.
 Liu Long entered.
 Seeing that Li Hao was sitting there in a daze, as if he was thinking about something, he said,""Don't enter the remains tomorrow. "
 "Enter!"
 Li Hao raised his head, looked at Liu Long, and smiled,""Why don't you enter?"
 "Boss, do you also think that since teacher left, I should tuck my tail between my legs and hide well, best to hide in a place with no one around, hide until teacher appears again?"
 "That's not what I meant. It's just that you're in danger right now ..."  "Yes, I know!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Boss, can you do me a favor?" Li Hao nodded and asked.
 "Speak," he said.
 "Teach me how to extract the mysterious energy."
 Yes, Li Hao wouldn 't.
 Liu Long might be able to do it. In the past, it had always been Yun Yao who did it, but Li Hao felt that it shouldn't be too difficult. Many people would extract it.
 He didn't ask the night patrolmen, he would be more at ease if he asked Liu Long.
 Liu Long frowned slightly, but he quickly replied,"In the past, my methods were very troublesome, but now, they are much simpler. This time, many sunlit and three suns had died, and their bones were the best storage! "In addition, they've also recently launched an energy storage box. You know that, it's also a good thing. After a superhuman dies, their energy will not dissipate quickly but will be concentrated in their flesh and blood. If you have an energy storage box, you can just stuff it into the energy storage box. "
 "When you need it, just crush the flesh and blood. The energy will naturally overflow."
 Li Hao nodded. It was indeed much easier with an energy storage box.
 In that case, he'd better bring an energy storage box in.
 As the two of them were talking, Wang Ming ran in hurriedly and said,"The swords gate, Yama, and Fei Tian are all here! It looks like we still have to continue exploring the ruins. "
 Li Hao quickly walked out of the tent.
 At this moment, a group of people came from a distance. They did not enter the camp, but waited for the night patrolman to leave.
 Li Hao hurriedly ran in that direction ... Wang Ming couldn't even catch him, so he followed him in a hurry and whispered,"What are you doing!"
 "Let's go and watch the show!"
 Li Hao said perfunctorily.
 He wasn't just watching the fun, he was choosing his target.
 Earth energy and metal energy users were his first targets. He had to figure out which of these powerhouses fit his criteria.
 In addition, he would also see if there were any hidden powerhouses. If there were, he would stay away from them.
 Now, these guys had actually come.
 When his teacher was fighting with sun Yifei, these guys were too far away. Even if they could see the light, they couldn't see it clearly. Now, they could see it clearly.
 For example, Li Hao saw that Zi Yue was very strong and had an origin divine weapon. She was even stronger than sun Yifei and might be at the peak of three yang or higher.
  The probability of him being above three-yang was not too high. The probability was that he was an expert at the peak of three-yang.
 On this side, he saw a similar ball of light from far away.
 It should be the reincarnation King 's.
 The leader of the Yama seemed to be an expert on the same level as Zi Yue, and this guy seemed to have an origin divine weapon as well. Li Hao looked at him from a hundred meters away and could vaguely see something that was either a Dragon or a snake swimming in his body.
 Li Hao had also discovered that these origin God weapons seemed to be in the form of animals.
 Or rather, this was what the ball of light was like.
 The specific shape might be that of a weapon.
 Could it be that these origin God weapons were made from animals ... Or demons that had turned into spirits?
 For example, Black Panther?
 The Black Panther could only be considered a demon, not a real spiritual monster. Li Hao didn't pay much attention to the Black Panther's absence today. It was very smart. It must have sensed that there were too many strong people and found a place to hide.

 "It's not the five elements!"
 With one look at the Samsara King, Li Hao could tell that he was not of the five elements. From the shape of the ball of light, he seemed to be a wind-type expert.
 The ball of light was more erratic, similar to the yellow cloud.
 He continued to look. Yama should have another three suns expert.
 Sure enough, he saw a second three Sun Expert behind Lord zhuanhuan. He felt that the ball of light in his body was a little smaller, similar to Hao lianchuan 'S. He might be at the peak of the three sun initial stage.
 "Hmm ... This is good. It seems to be the metal element!"
 Li Hao's interest was piqued, and he quickly shifted his gaze.
 The metal element was good, but unfortunately, the other party was a three-Sun Expert.
 He continued to observe. This time, the experts from several sides had come, and there was a high probability that all of them would come. This was to prevent the experts from leaving. If something happened to the others, or they were already prepared to enter the ruins, they would be too lazy to return and set up camp.
 There were not many Yama's people, only around 30.
  As for the flying heavens, there were even fewer people. There were only about 20 of them, and they were all wearing cloaks.
 The remaining swords gate disciples were not few, almost 50 people.
 Obviously, as a local organization, there were still many supers who joined swords gate, but the quality was much lower than that of the other two. Li Hao looked at the light orbs and saw that some of them were probably just New Moon Warriors, and some of them were even Starlight Masters.
 He looked around one by one and saw that there were still some people from small organizations who had not left and had also mixed in.
 "Yama has two three suns, flying heavens ... There are actually two flying heavens!"
 Li Hao was secretly shocked. There were so few fairies, but there were still two three suns here. However, he did not see any existence on the level of the Samsara King.
 He then looked at swords gate ... And was slightly surprised. On swords gate's side, other than Hong Yitang, there was another three suns expert, but he was very low-key, hiding in the crowd and not revealing himself. Other than that, there seemed to be some martial masters that Li Hao couldn't see through.
 "Swords gate also has two three suns!"
 Li Hao was extremely surprised. If that was the case, then other than hou Xiaochen and Chief Steward Yu, the other Nightwatchers might not be as good as swords gate's Nightwatchers. After all, Hao lianchuan was the only one with three suns.
 What was going on?
 Even if the night patrollers were not as powerful as the three major organizations, they shouldn't be weaker than the swords gate, right?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Even without the Crimson Moon, these guys are still so powerful!"
 As for sunlight, there were even more.
 The one with the most in sunlight was not Yama or night patrolmen, but the flying heavens!
 Li Hao was secretly shocked. He counted carefully and found that there were a total of 22 cloaked men in fairy. Two of them were three suns, the other 13 were probably sunlit, and only seven were dark moons or existences above the full moon.
 “艹!”
 Didn't they say that sunlight was rare?
 This time, everyone paid attention to them. Seven night patrollers came. Li Hao thought that was already a lot, but it was really not a lot?
 Did these guys come out in full force?
 At this moment, hou Xiaochen walked out. He didn't bother with formalities and directly said, "I've thought about the remains tomorrow. Let's set it at six in the morning. If you don't want to quit, then enter tomorrow morning! As for the relics, we can enter them together. After entering, there will be several forks where we can go separately or together. If we don't enter together, the door of the relics will only open once a month. After that, we can only wait for next month or when everyone comes out ..."
 In the distance, the tall reincarnation King said calmly,""That's possible, but we need to talk about other aspects as well. "  "Go ahead,"
 "Make some restrictions on the number of people."
 "How do you think we should limit it?" hou Xiaochen laughed.
 " 20 people each!"
 "It's not good to enter too much,"the reincarnation King said calmly. It was also easy for disputes to arise and interfere with other people's exploration. Yama, sky fairies, night patrollers, and swords gate each have 20 people. As for the other smaller organizations, 20 people in total, so a total of 100 people will be enough. "
 p Too much was indeed not good.  If it was too chaotic, it would easily trigger more traps.
 Just as he said that, a cold snort was heard. The next moment, a purple figure descended. The purple Moon broke through the sky and said coldly,""Linghuan, have you forgotten about the Crimson Moon?"
 "No, but the red moon ..." The king of Samsara frowned.
 Didn't they all die?
 As he said that, his eyes moved slightly.
 At this moment, in the distance, ghostly figures were running toward them at high speed.
 At this moment, everyone felt a little strange.
 The red moon ... And someone else!
 So many of them had been killed before, even a few of the three suns had been killed, but there were still people from the red moon!
 Just how many men had Crimson Moon planted in Silver Moon?
 One had to know that this was only a border province.
 There were 99 provinces in the star dynasty. This place could be considered important, but it was not that important.
 The three great organizations regarded Silver Moon as important, but neither Yama nor fairy were like red Moon, who could quickly gather another group of powerhouses after killing them.
 They were obviously not weak!
  There were more than 20 people who had come. Among them, there were a few with the aura of the glorious sun. As for whether there were three suns or not, the others could not easily judge.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, saw it clearly.
 It seemed that the three suns had really been killed.
 But wasn't the purple Moon the three suns?
 Could it be that Ziyue would enter this time?
 He was also shocked by Hong Yue's strength. So many of them had died, but she could still quickly gather another team. Hong Yue's strength was really powerful.
 However, Li Hao quickly lowered his head.
 He found that on Red moon's side, not only Zi Yue, but also the ghostly faces who had just arrived, many people were focused on him.
 Even though it wasn't obvious, he could still feel it.
 This was the judgment of a Martial master's Shi.

 These people were all staring at him!
 'Damn it!'
 In that case, the red moon's bigger goal was still on him.
 Was it because of the Silver City?
 "Hongyue is indeed the strongest of the three great organizations!" Hou Xiaochen laughed. Amazing!"
 These words were clearly to sow discord.
 However, the three major organizations did not fall for this trick, so it was useless to provoke them.
 "I don't see too many people in each family, so it's fine to limit the number of people. If you want to go in, then go in. There aren't many night patrols either, so some won't go in," hou Xiaochen said with a smile.
 "Since Ziyue is here, shouldn't we discuss who can't go in?"
 He chuckled."Me, Ziyue, zhuanhuan, and I won't be going in. The flying mountain isn't here yet. Forget it. How about the three of us restrain ourselves a little?"
  The Samsara King did not have any objections, but Zi Yue said coldly,""Haokong isn't dead, so I naturally won't enter! Now that haokong is dead, and Yuan Shuo was the one who killed him, hou Xiaochen, why don't we talk after I kill Hao lianchuan?"
 If she didn't go in, the red moon would lose its three suns expert, so what was the point of going in?
 To die?
 Hao lianchuan glanced at her and cursed in his heart.
 If you want to kill someone, then you think of me. Why don't you say you killed the Marquis?
 Hou Xiaochen sighed,"you're at the peak of the three-yang realm and you have an origin god weapon ... If you go in, things will be difficult." I originally wanted everyone to go in and explore together, but if you go in, with your personality, won't you take action soon? Then there's no point in working together to explore. "
 "Besides, if you go in, the cycle of rotation will also want to go in, so I have no choice but to go in as well ... In that case, why don't we just start a war here?"
 Ziyue's face was cold and she didn't reply.
 She was going in anyway!
 It wasn't just because of the ruins. More importantly, she wanted to capture Li Hao inside. Now ... With hou Xiaochen around, she really didn't dare to make a move.
 Of course, the prerequisite was that Li Hao would also enter.
 Hou Xiaochen seemed to be in a difficult position. At this moment, the Samsara King laughed,"If Ziyue is going in, then I can't not go in either. Minister hou, if you're interested, you can go in too!"
 Would hou Xiaochen dare to?
 Once he entered the ruins, all of Silver Moon would probably be thrown into chaos.
 "You're checkmating me!"
 Hou Xiaochen chuckled. After a moment of consideration, he said, "It's a pity that Yuan Shuo has escaped. "
 He thought for a while and said,"then wait for a while. I'll inform someone to come over. He's here. You can go in or not. It's up to you!"
 The few of them felt a little strange.
 Who would come?
 Would he even make hou Xiaochen think that he could fight against the Samsara King and purple Moon?
 Hao lianchuan was also curious.  Other than me, are there any other three suns experts?
 And it could even defend against experts like Ziyue and the others?
 However, hou Xiaochen didn't say much about this."Then it's decided. Also, maybe I'm being a bit too talkative, but I still have to say this. After we go in, it's best if everyone works together! This ancient city is not simple. Otherwise, we, the night patrollers, would have finished exploring it long ago. It would not be our turn to come here together. It wasn't a good idea to rush to finish off the opponent after entering! If we kill as soon as we enter, we'll all die!"
 "Also, once the door to the remains is opened, you have to wait until midnight the next day to come out. That is to say, if you go in tomorrow morning, you can only come out at midnight tomorrow at the earliest. Otherwise, you can't open the door ... Not to mention three suns, even sunguang might not be able to open it."
 Everyone felt a little strange when they heard this.
 The entrance to the ruins was this sturdy?
 Of course, this also meant that the ruins really weren't simple. Hou Xiaochen didn't need to lie about this.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything else. He turned around and walked back to his tent. "Let's go. Just come with us tomorrow morning. I thought you were going to surround the night patrolmen."
 Outside, the supers did not say much and quickly dispersed.
 However, they didn't go far. They were still very close to the night patrolmen's camp.
 ……
 Li Hao didn't care about those people. At this moment, he glanced at Liu Yan, who was beside him. Seeing that her eyes were fierce and she kept staring at someone, he followed her line of sight and saw a strong man.
 Looking at the ball of light, it was a sunshine warrior.
 This was probably that li Dahu, right?
 "Sister?"
 Ever since they arrived at the crosscut Canyon, Liu Yan had been very quiet and barely spoke.
 Li Hao knew that she was eager for revenge.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Now, his enemy was right in front of him, but he was helpless. It was indeed very uncomfortable.
 "I'm fine,"she said.
 "I think someone from Hongyue was looking at you just now. You'd better not go in ..." Liu Yan said in a low voice.
  "Don't worry,"
 Li Hao smiled and shook his head."Sister, just find an opportunity to kill that guy. Don't be angry. It's bad for your health."
 "You don't have to worry about that, little Hao. Just be careful."
 Liu Yan didn't say much. If she said too much, Li Hao and the others would go and find trouble with li Dahu, and that would be even more troublesome.
 Even if they entered the remains, they couldn't just take revenge.
 He also needed to find an opportunity.
 At that moment, Wang Ming also walked over and asked curiously,""Who do you think the Minister will send over? From what he said, it's obvious that the people who came are not weak. Could they be experts from the headquarters "night patrol?"
 Li Hao shook his head. How could he know?
 Or maybe chief Yu?
 Looking at chief Yu's ball of light, it was even stronger than Zi Yue. Perhaps it was the rising light that the Minister had just mentioned. Even if it wasn 't, it was at least at the peak of three yang.

 If this person were to enter, he would be able to deal with the other two.
 ……
 The night patrolmen were also waiting.
 Since the Minister was sure that he would not go in, who would go in next would be very important.
 Hao lianchuan was sulking alone, and no one cared.
 Obviously, everyone felt that this person was unable to resist the purple Moon and the reincarnation King.
 It was not until midnight that a loud noise was heard, waking everyone up. Everyone guessed that an expert had come.
 Soon, Li Hao followed everyone out.
 It was a plane in the air.
 Or rather, a helicopter.
  The military!
 When they saw this, a thought flashed through everyone's mind. Only the military would have this.
 The civilian version was said to be available in the central region, but Silver Moon did not have it, and only the military could use it.
 The next moment, a figure jumped down from the sky.
 There was a loud boom!
 The ground cracked open. With such a huge movement, even the organizations outside could feel it and came closer.
 A moment later, the smoke dissipated, and everyone saw a person.
 He looked to be in his forties, had short hair, and was expressionless.
 At this moment, he was wearing a black military uniform, which was similar to a patrol uniform but not exactly the same. It was more domineering.
 When he saw who it was, Wang Ming was startled and a little dazed.
 He looked at the man and was a little shocked after a while.""Oh my God, why is he here ..."
 "You know him?"
 Li Hao asked in a low voice. Very strong!
 As soon as this man came, he noticed something different. He was dazzling, and he wasn't very strong. He felt like sun Yifei, but the feeling and the temperament ... He was very strong!
 "Do you know about the garrison?"
 Wang Ming whispered,"Didn't I tell you before that there are three hundred thousand troops stationed in Silver Moon province?" My Wang family also has some power in there. "The garrison is mainly divided into three parts, each consisting of about 100000 people. This is commander Hu of the Tigerwing Army, one of the three armies of Silvermoon. He is in charge of the Tigerwing Army, but ... The military and the night patrols rarely act together ..."
 As he spoke, the middle-aged man nodded at hou Xiaochen.
 He looked out again, his eyes extremely cold."Get lost! If you want to die, I'll naturally help you when we enter the ruins!"
 In the distance, a few figures appeared.
 Zi Yue's expression was a little serious as she said coldly,""Hu dingfang, when did the military get involved in these things?"
 Hu dingfang!
 At this moment, those who didn't know him all remembered this name.
 Hu dingfang glanced at her coldly. After a moment, he said indifferently,""Ziyue, I told you to get lost. Who gave you the right to fly in front of me and look down on me while talking? Minister hou won't argue with you, but I, Hu dingfang, will not tolerate you! If you don't get lost, I'll annihilate your Red Moon division first!"
 "Hmph!"
 Zi Yue snorted coldly but did not say anything more. She turned around and left.
 Hu dingfang!
 It was beyond their expectations.
 They had thought that the night patrollers had sent an expert, but that was not the case. Instead, it was the military.
 It was Hu dingfang, the commander of the Tiger wing Army.
 When did the Nightwalker and the military reach an agreement?
 This was something that they had not expected.
 "Tiger," hou Xiaochen laughed,"they're already here, so why bother arguing with them?"
 Hu dingfang nodded slightly. He was still cold, but perhaps he was born with such an expression, so he was not cold.
 He didn't say much. He looked at the night patrollers around him and said coldly,""I'm not familiar with you. Minister hou invited me over only to fight against Ziyue and zhuanlun. We'll do what we have to do tomorrow ... If Ziyue and zhuanlun don't interfere, I won't help either."
 These words were a little cold.
 Beside them, Hao lianchuan pouted.
 As if he had been seen, Hu dingfang suddenly looked at him.""Hao lianchuan, if you weren't so useless, why did you let me in?"
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan almost exploded in anger. He said angrily,""Hu dingfang, I'm not your subordinate!"
 "Tomorrow will be the day!"
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan was speechless. He looked at hou Xiaochen.  Let this guy lead the team this time and be the leader?
 He also knew Hu dingfang, who was a truly heartless and ruthless man.
 Being with him made Hao lianchuan's body itch.
 Hou Xiaochen had a look of comfort on his face. There was nothing he could do about it, as it was not convenient for him to go in. He could only ask for help from the military. He would just have to bear with it for a while, as night patrols were more used to freedom.
 However, Hu dingfang, who came from the military, was more used to following the rules. He was a very serious person, so it was inevitable that the night patrolmen would not be used to it.
 Seeing this, Hao lianchuan revealed a look of despair.
 It's finished!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hu dingfang seemed to be smiling in the depths of his eyes.
 He didn't pay any more attention to Hao lianchuan. He looked around and finally looked at Li Hao, probably trying to identify who Yuan Shuo's disciple was.
 After watching for a while, he nodded slightly.
 Li Hao was taken aback. He looked at Wang Ming next to him, and as expected, Wang Ming was delighted and hurriedly said,"Uncle Hu!"
 Hu dingfang was slightly stunned. He glanced at him, and after a while, he nodded slightly and returned to his cold self.
 Wang Ming was also taken aback. What was going on?
 Weren't you the one who nodded at me?
 Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered to greet him. He's also a little afraid of this person.
 Wang Ming was a little confused, and so was Li Hao. It was a little strange; it felt like Hu dingfang had greeted him before, but he didn't know this person. Could it be that he knew teacher?
 That was a possibility.
 ……
 Hu dingfang and hou Xiaochen quickly entered the tent.
 In the tent.
 "It's good that you're here,"hou Xiaochen laughed." Otherwise, things would've been even more difficult. "
 He then smiled and said,"you saw Li Hao?" He insisted on going in, so there's no other way. "
 "Good, that's how the people of the five birds sect should be!"
 Hu dingfang's tone was indifferent.
 "You make it sound like you're from the five birds sect as well," hou Xiaochen chuckled,"but you're indeed half a member. Did Yuhua say anything to you before you came?"
 Speaking of Yu Hua, Hu dingfang actually showed a faint smile. It was very little, but he was indeed smiling. He nodded slightly and said,""I told you to kill all of Hong Yue's people! Also, let her Junior Brother return safely. Old man Yuan has disappeared, so as his Senior Sister, she has to take care of him. "
 Senior Sister!
 If Li Hao were here, he would probably be dumbfounded as well.
 He knew that he had a Senior Sister.
 And he was much older than him, in his thirties. According to his teacher, he was old and yellow, with no future, so he was working in white moon City to support the family.
 However, Yuan Shuo had never mentioned that his Senior Sister had a relationship with Hu dingfang.
 Hou Xiaochen wasn't surprised. He chuckled,"Do as you see fit. Old Yuan has run away, leaving us with a lot of trouble. Yu Hua is fine, she doesn't show her face much. With you around, Li Hao is indeed in a lot of trouble."
 "In my opinion, there's no need to go through so much trouble!"
 Hu dingfang said coldly,"we'll attack tonight and kill them all!" "When the others arrive, we'll cover them all and kill them all indiscriminately. This will naturally intimidate a group of people!"
 "You ... Forget it, let's not talk about this."
 Hou Xiaochen shook his head and rejected the suggestion.
 "We can make a move in the ruins, but so what if we destroy a branch outside? You're too impulsive, so you should just talk less. "
 "Then forget it!"
 Hu dingfang did not say anything more. He stood up and said,""I'm going to get some rest. I'll be there tomorrow. Also, can I hit Hao lianchuan if he doesn't listen to me?"
 Hou Xiaochen was silent for a long time.
 This question ... Was really difficult to answer.
  After a long while, he said gloomily,"up to you."
 "Alright, we can fight!"
 With that, he turned around and walked out.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
 You always want to hit him, what's going on?
 Wasn't it just a few years ago when Hao lianchuan met Yu Hua, they exchanged a few words and chatted for a while, and he asked her if she was willing to join the night patrol and so on?
 Why!
 It had been so many years, and he still held a grudge ... Who said that soldiers didn't hold grudges?
 Hou Xiaochen sighed. It seemed like he had to talk to Hao lianchuan. 'You might have forgotten about this, but Hu dingfang still remembers.'
 He's very narrow-minded!

 August 28th.
 Morning, 5 o' clock.
 The campsite began to clamor.
 According to their agreement, they would enter the remains at Sixo' clock. However, Li Hao still didn't know where the remains were. He only knew that it was an ancient city.
 The transverse Canyon was huge.
 Yuan Shuo didn't have the time to tell him where the ancient city was buried, and Li Hao didn't ask the Nightwalker either. In any case, he just had to follow them.
 The sky was not completely bright yet.
 While the night patrolmen were making a ruckus, the supers outside were not sleeping. At this moment, there were some movements.
 Soon, a group of supers gathered in the center of the camp.
 There were quite a few people, but many of them would not enter.
  Hou Xiaochen walked out with majordomo Yu's help ... The others didn't react, and Li Hao managed to keep calm. Wang Ming, however, wanted to gossip. Did these two sleep together last night?
 But when he saw hou Xiaochen's smiling face ... Wang Ming was a little scared and didn't dare to whisper.
 "Let's go,"he said.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything. Hu dingfang quickly walked over and stood in front of the crowd, somewhat stealing Hao lianchuan's seat.
 Hao lianchuan shot him a glance.
 It was said that the people in the military were upright, but he felt that this guy was evil. He liked to find trouble for no reason, and he especially disliked this bastard.
 "Stand properly! You didn't eat your fill?"
 At this moment, Hu dingfang turned his head to look at him and scolded him.
 Hao lianchuan wanted to hit him!
 Who are you scolding?
 I'm the Deputy Minister, and the first Deputy Minister at that.
 Of course, in terms of rank, the night patrolman might be half a rank lower than the military. After all, the night patrolman was originally only a subordinate organization of the inspection Bureau. In other words, the Secretary of the Silver Moon province of the inspection Bureau was the immediate superior, on the same level as the commander of the garrison in the military.
 As for hou Xiaochen, he could be considered on the same level as Hu dingfang. Hu dingfang was only one of the three army commanders, while Hao lianchuan was indeed half a level lower.
 Hu dingfang's scolding also made the others feel a little strange.
 Hao lianchuan was their superior.
 Some people felt that it was inappropriate, not to mention that Hao lianchuan was a three-sun powerhouse. Most importantly, Hao lianchuan was a good person. Some people were still a little unhappy that their superior was being scolded.
 Even if the other party was here to hold the ground!
 Seeing this, hou Xiaochen was just about to say something when Hu dingfang said,"What are you looking at? It's a personal grudge between Hao lianchuan and me, and it has nothing to do with you. Is there anyone who wants to take over this for Hao lianchuan?"
 “……”
 Silence.
 Personal grudges?
 Everyone was a little puzzled. What personal grudge could these two have?
 Hao lianchuan was also speechless."Hu dingfang, what personal grudges do we have?" If you're looking for trouble, just say it!"
 Hu dingfang ignored him.
 "A little ... A little," hou Xiaochen chuckled,"not much. Alright, let's not hurt our relationship."
 After saying that, he walked away.
 Hao lianchuan was deep in thought.  I don't remember!
 He really couldn't remember what personal grudges he had with this guy.
 ? A little bit?
 It was no wonder that this fellow had always been so disdainful when they met in the past.
 Was there really such a thing?
 But why didn't I know about it?
 He was a little puzzled and deliberately walked a little slower. When Minister hou and Hu dingfang were chatting in a low voice, he asked chief Yu in a low voice,""Yu dasi, do you know about this?"
 He really couldn't remember. Minister hou seemed to know, so chief Yu should know too.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Chief Steward Yu glanced at him and ignored him.
 Hao lianchuan was a little unhappy. Who was this?
 If he didn't want to say it, then so be it. What's with this expression!
 However, after some consideration, he caught up and whispered,""Let me tell you a little secret. The department head doesn't like to eat chili. Every time you give him spicy food, he will secretly pour it away after you leave!"
 “……”
 Chief Steward Yu looked at him for a while. In front of him, Minister hou, who was talking, turned his head and looked at him. He didn't say anything, but lowered his voice and said,""Don't go overboard with Hao lianchuan. We're all on the same side. If you really want to beat him up, you can do it after we leave the remains ..."
 Hu dingfang nodded slightly, understanding.
 At this moment, Chief Steward Yu thought for a while and said,""It's related to his wife. Think about it yourself!"
 Was it related to his wife?
 Hao lianchuan thought about it carefully."I know his wife, Chen Yuhua. She's quite pretty and we've chatted for a while a few years ago. She's also a Martial Master and is quite powerful. At that time, Yuan Shuo and the night patrolman had been working together, and I've talked to her a few times ..."
 How many times have we talked?
 It can't be because of this, right?
 It shouldn't be!
 Hu dingfang was not so petty. Besides, they had only chatted for a while and did not do anything.
 Could it be because of Yuan Shuo?
 Thinking of this, Hao lianchuan suddenly understood. Was it because of Yuan Shuo's injury three years ago?
 So his wife thinks it's my responsibility, so she asked Hu dingfan to deal with me?
 That was a possibility!
  But ... The one who asked Yuan Shuo to explore the remains was not me, but Minister hou.
 At the thought of this, Hao lianchuan felt a little disdainful."You're just a guy who bullies the weak and fears the strong. So you don't dare to cause trouble for the department head, so you came to me?"
 I finally understand!
 So it was like this.
 At the thought of this, Hao lianchuan found this guy even more unpleasant to the eye. He bullied the weak and feared the strong!
 However, his wife was quite good-looking ... It was a pity that she had such a cold-faced general.
 However, on second thought, his wife had told him about her, which was why this guy was targeting him. His wife was not a good person either.
 Hehe!
 Yuan Shuo's family did not have many good people.
 Thinking of this, he glanced at Li Hao, who was keeping an extremely low profile in the crowd. The more he looked, the more displeased he felt. This guy was acting so pitifully, so low-key, so innocent ...

 In fact, he was not a good person.
 Just like his teacher, when he wasn't strong enough, he would keep a low profile.
 When he was strong enough, he was crazy!
 ……
 While Hao lianchuan was gossiping in his heart ...
 Everyone walked out of the campsite. Outside, they were divided into a few camps.
 It was very quiet.
 Red Moon, flying heavens, Yama, and swords gate were the main force. There were also thirty to forty small organizations or independent supers. They were not strong, but they were not weak either. Yue Ming was the main force, and there were about ten people from sunlight.
 Some of the 14 small organizations had run away, but most of them had stayed behind. However, they did not bring the weak ones with them.
 Given the current situation, many from the three suns had gone in, even the purple Moon and the others. The supers of small organizations were afraid of death, so it was already bold enough to leave thirty to forty people behind.
  Including the night patrollers, there were close to 200 people who entered the remains this time.
 Seeing that hou Xiaochen and the others had come out, the others quickly followed. However, they didn't get too close, instead, they just followed behind.
 The group of people walked forward under the bright sky.
 It was not slow.
 After walking for about 20 minutes, hou Xiaochen stopped in front of a cliff.
 Everyone looked around in confusion.
 He didn't see anything special.
 At this moment, hou Xiaochen spoke up as he pointed at the cliff in front of them,"The entrance is here!"
 In an instant, seven to eight waves of ultra-power appeared and probed the cliff, but they still found nothing.
 "It'll be hard to find out!"Hou Xiaochen replied. If it weren't for Yuan Shuo leading us here, we wouldn't have known that there was an ancient site hidden here. "
 "Then how did Yuan Shuo find out?" someone in the crowd asked.
 "I don't know, he didn't say."
 Hou Xiaochen replied calmly,"the deal I made with him back then was for him to help me search through 30 ruins. As for the rest, I won't ask." I don't know how he found this place. I only know that he almost died in an expedition three years ago. Since everyone is here, you should know a thing or two. "
 "Is Yuan Shuo's breakthrough to the spirit accumulation stage related to this ruin?"
 Someone asked.
 Some of them glanced at the Crimson Moon's side, and some of them had strange looks in their eyes.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Obviously, they had also received the news from yesterday.
 The red shadow was the blood God!
 This time, there were many people from the red moon. Did this mean that these people also had blood deities?
 Without an origin god weapon, no one had any expectations or desires.
 However, everyone also knew that Yama's reincarnation King would definitely have an origin divine weapon. Hao lianchuan might have brought one with him. As for Fei Tian, he had not come halfway up the mountain, so it was not clear whether he had brought one.
  There was also Hong Yitang from swords gate. He was able to create swords gate and even cultivate some supers, but who knew if swords gate had an origin divine weapon?  If that was the case, the people here might also be tempted.
 Ziyue had obviously received the news as well, and her eyes turned cold.
 Last night, the headquarters had sent a message, telling her to be careful and that someone from the headquarters would come to meet her soon. However, after this relic exploration, she had to keep a low profile. The central region had been attacked, and some of the strongholds had been uprooted.
 Heavy losses!
 In just one night, several three suns experts had disappeared, and a lot of the sunlight had also disappeared.
 Seeing that someone was staring at her, Ziyue said coldly,""Do you all want to die? The news was either released by Yuan Shuo himself or someone was trying to fish in troubled waters! If that's the case, someone from my Red Moon would have already advanced to the spirit accumulation stage!"
 No one spoke.
 It was up to them to believe it or not.
 Hou Xiaochen laughed,"Ziyue, there's no point in discussing this now. Before we leave, I have something to remind everyone!" After entering, we'll cooperate as much as we can. I'm not worried that you'll harm the night patrollers ... But this time, we've really come to explore the ruins with great hope. If we miss this opportunity, it's hard to say whether these ruins will belong to the central continent or to yinyue. "
 Everyone was deep in thought, but they didn't say anything.
 Hou Xiaochen's words made sense.
 When the people from the central region came, would this place still belong to them?
 "I won't say any unnecessary words!"
 Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything else. In the next moment, he sent a mysterious energy towards the cliff.
 At that moment, Hao lianchuan also shot a beam of fire energy at her.
 After a while, the other supers sent energy into the wall one after another.
 Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it at first.
 However ... When everyone had inserted their energy, he was slightly stunned and a little distracted.
 "Metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, Thunder, dark ..."
 The eight types of energy seemed to have their own directions.
  Li Hao observed carefully. At this moment, he connected it to one thing-gossip!
 Eight types of energy seemed to have been injected into the ruins.
 The key point was that the position of the attack was somewhat similar to the eight trigrams.
 "Eight Trigrams?"
 At this moment, Li Hao suddenly thought of the eight trigrams in the sky above the silver Blizzard city.
 This place ... Could it really be related to the Silver City?
 His teacher had also said that at the main gate of the ancient city, there was a small picture of a turtle. Ever since he had heard about the eight great families, he had felt that it might have something to do with them. One of the eight great families, the Wang family, had a folk song that said,"the Wang family raised a big turtle."
 Of course, apart from this, Yuan Shuo didn't seem to have any other evidence to prove that it was related to the eight great families.
 But this way of activating it ... Why did it seem like gossip?
 His teacher didn't mention it either. Li Hao felt regretful. If his teacher were here, he would like to ask him how he had discovered this place and how he had found a way to open it.
