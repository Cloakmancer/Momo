To have his plan ruined by such a piece of trash ... He couldn't accept this!Everyone had tried their best!Old Zhang and the others, who were not here, had tried their best. He did not expect old Zhang to break the two worlds. It could only be said that old Zhang had a very far vision, but ... Everyone had tried their best, but they had missed out on a weakling like Fu Sheng. This made him feel helpless.Just as everyone was feeling extremely depressed.Li Hao also took a deep breath and watched as the fist fell on the time star. At this moment, Li Hao moved a little, and a long river appeared under his feet. In just a moment, he and venerable sovereign fleeting life seemed to have stepped into the long river of time at the same time.At this moment, Li Hao found it difficult to reverse time or freeze time.However, the appearance of the river of time and bringing Fu Sheng forward ... It was still possible to go with the flow.He didn't know what the future was like, what the road ahead was like, what the future was like ...However, he could only take a walk.Li Hao had used time many times. He had turned back time, watched the Daoists from Tian Fang preach, walked through neo martial arts, and watched the rise of neo martial arts. However, he rarely used the power of the future because there were too many uncertain factors in the future.No one knew what the future held.In the past, he had summoned his future self and fused the three of them into one. It was only a future in the next moment, but Li Hao had paid a huge price for it.He would not use the future unless he had no other choice.The future was too illusory!"You will never know what the future will be like. Among the countless possibilities, perhaps the future you will face will only be death.The path to the future ... That was extremely uncertain."Perhaps the future you will be extremely powerful, but the past you might not appear. The future you will not be the real you ..."Normally, Li Hao wouldn't think about or use such a complicated ability.At this moment, only by going with the flow could he maximize his strength, and that was the only thing Li Hao could do.A cursory glance!It was just a moment, but they felt like countless years had passed. Fu Sheng was a little confused, and Li Hao felt a little uncomfortable.The waves of the long river led to an unknown place.Just as Li Hao was struggling to continue, as if nothing had happened, venerable Emperor fleeting life was still confused and was about to attack Li Hao ...Suddenly, at the end of the river, there seemed to be something that was not Li Hao's future self.Li Hao actually couldn't see his future on this River.He didn't know why.Or could it be that his future didn't have much to do with the river of time?Was it because he had given up on the river of time?Or why?He didn't have the time to think about it anymore. When they went down the river of time and reached the end of it, suddenly, in the depths of the river ... It seemed like ... A person was sleeping?Sleeping?Who would sleep in the depths of the river of time?This was a human?Or ... Some special existence? Even Li Hao himself wasn't sure what was at the end of the river of time, so he naturally couldn't tell.At that moment ... The snoring man at the end of the river suddenly opened his eyes.He seemed to have been woken up!He looked at the upper reaches of the river in confusion. At that moment, something seemed to appear in the man's eyes. It was a look of confusion, doubt, and ... Unspeakable displeasure.He seemed to be extremely upset that he had been woken up from his sleep.He suddenly looked at Li Hao, at the stars above Li Hao's head, and then at the sword in Li Hao's hand that was about to completely shatter. He was stunned for a moment, and then looked at Fu Sheng ...  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  He was stunned again!"Time ..." He murmured, his voice seemed to penetrate the world, penetrate the heavens and the earth, and his murmurs resounded through the long river,""Did I sleep until time went back?"What did he just see?He seemed to have seen ... The time King!He seemed to see the chaotic world, war, destruction, and the turning back of time ...Was it?He did not know.However, Shi Guang was such a shocking person. Was he ... Being hunted down?Could this be the so-called great enemy of time in the firmament?Was it very powerful?He did not know.At this moment, he suddenly moved, and a long sword appeared in his hand ... It was like ... Like the firmament sword!At that moment, Li Hao's eyes suddenly widened!At that moment, he saw countless divine runes. They were so dense that it was unbelievable. Those divine runes instantly gathered and turned into extremely thick great DAOs ... No, those were not great DAOs. He couldn't tell what they were.Was it an orderly great Dao?Were they ... Rules?He couldn't explain it clearly!He only saw the man's sword strike, shattering the earth and cutting off the flow of the river, and going straight for Fu Sheng. The man who had just woken up looked a little excited, but also a little confused and curious. His emotions were so complicated that Li Hao couldn't understand them for a moment."Turning back time? Time King ... I've scammed you of so many things, but you're not a good person either ... You've opened up the river, so why don't you get rid of the remaining troubles?""How strong are you?"Countless doubts emerged from the depths of the river. With one sword, the world collapsed and the river broke. BOOM!A loud bang!Venerable sovereign fleeting life coughed up blood and retreated. He looked at his opponent in shock. How could an advanced venerable sovereign appear here?Where did it come from?Where did Li Hao take him?Why did a high-level venerable sovereign appear out of nowhere? what was scary was that this person's Dao was different from the ordinary Dao of chaos.

Chapter 3441 Di Shi (1)(2)
What the hell was this?The power of the countless great DAOs seemed to be extremely orderly. However, this group of people, whether it was the Dao of chaos or the Dao of the universe, were somewhat disorderly mixed among them. When they encountered such an extremely regular great Dao, they suddenly showed signs of collapsing!BOOM!With a loud noise, venerable sovereign fleeting life was knocked back, and Li Hao's expression changed slightly. As for the man who cut the river with a sword, he was somewhat surprised, confused, and depressed ..."Retreat?" the murmurs resounded around the river."It's ... Just ... Retreating?"How could it be!I'm invincible in the world!He actually couldn't kill him with one strike!"Why?"He murmured and looked at Li Hao with mixed feelings. Suddenly, he recorded Li Hao with a piece of divine text and murmured,""You ... Where are you?"Li Hao's heart also moved. He looked at this person, but his vision was a little blurry, as if he did not exist in the world. "I'm in the chaos!""Chaos? How could it be ... The chaos ... I've already unified it!"Li Hao's heart trembled. How could he have unified Hundun? he had to be at least at the ninth-rank, but he was strong enough to kill Fu Sheng with one strike. However, Fu Sheng was only at the eighth-rank, and he had just entered the eighth-rank, and he was injured at that ...This person's strength was at most at the eighth-grade!Level eight, to unify the chaos?What a joke!The next moment, his heart trembled as if he had understood something. Chaos ... Pseudo-chaos?How was that possible?Why was it impossible?His emotions instantly became a little agitated. He wanted to say something, but he suddenly seemed to have touched on something. A sense of danger instantly emerged. Li Hao's expression changed, and he instantly shouted,""If you want to find me, come out!"With that, the river broke, the world collapsed, and the future disappeared.At the end of the river, the man was stunned for a moment. After a long time, he suddenly murmured,""Come out? Another F * cking pit ... Go back to sleep. The next time you F * cking appear, I'll kill you with one punch!"It was obviously a big problem!He hated trouble the most in his life.Was this the young time King?It didn't look good!Being hunted down? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  It's just that ... From the looks of it, there might be countless experts. Forget it, forget it. I can't chase after him. I'm so tired. I want to sleep.He fell into a deep sleep once again, but his heart was slightly moved.The waves rose.I came out to find him ... So, I'm not in the entire chaos?Forget it, forget it!Shi Guang ... I've recorded your pathetic state, and you're actually being hunted down!And ... Are these people fighting?Why was there a battle everywhere? Boring, so boring, continue sleeping!……BOOM!Heaven and earth seemed to collapse, and the water of the long river flowed. Li Hao and venerable Emperor fleeting life were still in the same place, but at this moment, a bloody wound suddenly appeared on venerable Emperor fleeting life's body, and he retreated instantly!"Cough ..."Venerable sovereign fleeting life was aghast. What was going on?The other party's strength wasn't what he was shocked by. What he was shocked by was ... Where was the place he had just seen?Who was that?Why did an advanced venerable sovereign suddenly appear? moreover, the power of the great path seemed to be different from his own. At this moment, the power of the great path in his body was turbulent, as if the external energy was correcting his power of the great path and eliminating it.Why so?As this thought came to his mind, he was suddenly jolted awake. When he looked again, he was already quite a distance away from Li Hao. He had actually been pushed back.And this amount of time was enough to change some things.At this moment, the Thunder monarch roared and the power of Thunder burst forth. With a loud boom, the three type 8 powerhouses attacked crazily while the other three were suppressed and shaken. Finally, under the thousands of Thunderbolts, one of the sun and moon emperors was completely torn apart and his physical body exploded!"Nether sun!"The other level eight venerable sovereign woke up instantly. His eyes were filled with sorrow. He roared and struggled madly.p The power of his great Dao spread wildly.Earth-splitting Supreme Emperor was also struggling madly and roaring,""Fu Sheng, you bastard!"Trash!Li Hao was only at the seventh step and had spent a lot of strength on them, but he, an eighth step, was actually forced to retreat. How could you be so useless?Venerable monarch fleeting life's expression also changed instantly!He was one step too late!Dark Sun Thearch had been killed!Not good!He didn't expect that just as he was about to succeed, Li Hao would suddenly bring him to an unknown place and force him back with an unfamiliar power.This incident destroyed his Grand idea of saving everyone.The sun of the underworld was dead!At that moment, monarch Wushan plucked countless threads and his fingers burst. As if he was changing his fate, he roared and the clouds, mountains, and sea of mist collapsed. His five fingers were completely shattered. With a loud roar, the body of monarch earth-rending suddenly shattered and the black gas around him shot up to the sky!Earth-shattering Supreme Emperor was a rank eight earth-type Supreme Emperor with unparalleled defense. However, at this moment, Wu Shan's attack did not seem to come from his physical body or even his great Dao. Instead, it seemed to be fate ...He would end his life!He had broken his luck!BOOM!Earth-splitting Supreme Emperor's body began to crack, but he glared at Fu Sheng. At this moment, he did not scold Li Hao and the others. Instead, he looked at Fu Sheng and suddenly cursed,""If I had known earlier, I would never have cooperated with the stupid pigs!""An eighth level venerable sovereign couldn't break the time star when no one could stop him. Such a long time was wasted by this man. To think that we still believed that he could break the time seal!

He had overestimated Fu Sheng, this trash!If he had known that this would happen, he would have self-detonated his great Dao to retaliate. He actually placed his hopes on Fu Sheng ... Samsara, you actually revived this idiot. Perhaps it would be better without him!Venerable sovereign fleeting life's expression changed again and again. He originally wanted to charge at Li Hao again, but lie tu and venerable sovereign Dark Sun were killed in an instant. He instantly realized that if he continued to charge, the three level 8 Masters would surround him and kill him!In an instant, Fu Sheng flew towards the reincarnation Emperor and shouted,""Daoist master!"The reincarnation monarch punched out like a millstone of heaven and earth, forcing the human King to retreat. His face was livid as he looked at Fu Sheng, who was flying over. At this moment, even he wanted to curse. Trash!Fu Sheng, Why Don't You Just Die?They couldn't see anything else, but they only saw that Fu Sheng was pushed back when he approached Li Hao, causing him to miss the best opportunity and kill two level 8 powerhouses on the spot ...Eighth-rank!Li Hao was still suppressing three level 8s and did not have much energy left to counterattack.What's the point of you being alive?Although he wanted to kill Fu Sheng, he couldn't care about it anymore. He shouted,""If we can't kill the killer king in this battle, we'll be the ones to die!"The rank eight venerable sovereigns no longer cared about the lightning tribulation. They allowed the lightning tribulation to fall and began fighting with the human King. At this moment, the reincarnation sovereign had even given up on covering the surrounding Dao domain.In the blink of an eye, a boundlessly powerful aura filled the air. The entire Eastern Region was vast and boundless, but at this moment, the aura still spread out!Even Samsara's side, which had a large number of rank seven venerable sovereigns, was not as noisy as this side.It had been a million years since more than 10 level 8 venerable sovereigns had participated in the battle. Even the last time when they attacked Fu Sheng and the others, there were not as many level 8 venerable sovereigns as there were today.BOOM!Auras rose into the air as the two rank eights were killed on the spot. A chaotic force rose into the sky, shaking the great Dao and chaos. Some of the experts in the surrounding area instantly sensed something.Some people's expressions changed instantly!"Lie tu and nether sun, two level 8 powerhouses ... Have fallen!"They were all powerhouses from the East, so how could they not know each other?He was dead!Two level eight venerable sovereigns had died at once!Over there, there were still a large number of tier 8 powerhouses participating in the battle. What was going on?Also, weren't fu Sheng and the others all dead?Why ... Was he there too?!Countless doubts emerged, but at this moment, no one dared to go over. They were all shocked.As for the ninth layer of heaven, there was also movement, but it was far less powerful than here.BOOM!The sound of an explosion reverberated through the heavens and earth. At this moment, the 10000-way chessboard appeared. The Dao chess was not good at killing. It was not until this moment that the defense of his opponent, venerable Lord Yin Yue, was broken by the Dao chess. With a loud bang, her body exploded!The third rank 8 was finally killed.In just an instant, three level 8s had fallen ... The shockwaves shook the surrounding worlds. At this moment, the faces of the sector Lords in the surrounding worlds were ashen white. Was the East going to fall into complete chaos?Did a powerhouse of the eighth step die so easily?With the death of the three rank-8s, Li Hao finally recovered from the shock. However, he was still thinking about what had just happened. The man was not very strong, but the power of his great Dao ... The power of his great Dao, which was extremely orderly and almost did not contain any chaos, made him a little absent-minded. At this moment, he could not care about this.With the death of the three type 8 powerhouses, the situation changed.Although currently, even if the three rank eights died, they might not be able to gain much of an advantage. On the human ruler's side, the four rank eights of Samsara were still alive, and there was still the rank eight Beast of Chaos ... But, there was already a chance."Trap and kill them!" Li Hao shouted.He took the lead and charged over. He had already thrown his long sword away and punched out. A thousand worlds appeared and he went straight for Fu Sheng. Behind him, a few level eights quickly charged towards the human King!Kong Ji and the other rank-7s also charged in that direction, all of them roaring loudly as if they were venting their anger.Just now, he had been suppressed and beaten up, and he could be destroyed at any moment.As the three rank eights were killed ... The opportunity had come!…… At the same time.Emperor Cang and the Supreme, who had destroyed the two worlds, had already sensed the fluctuations. Previously, they had not been able to sense the exact situation, but now they could. The Supreme heaved a sigh of relief.It was still alright!He had almost delayed the important matter and almost caused Fang Ping's death.It was finally done!He didn't care too much and shouted,""Big cat, let's go and break the cycle of reincarnation!"Samsara was nearby.Previously, he was worried that he would be entangled by Samsara for too long, causing Fang ping to be killed. Now, even if Fang ping could not kill a few rank-8s, he would not be killed so easily.Since that was the case ... Break the cycle of reincarnation!The two rank eights fled madly into the air, heading straight for the world of reincarnation. The Supremes no longer concealed their auras. Their roars reverberated in all directions as they headed straight for the world of reincarnation,"The two emperors lie tu and sun Moon have both fallen! Are the Monarchs of Samsara going to be buried with Samsara?" Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  At this moment, many venerable sovereigns inside the reincarnation were shaken. A few Level Seven venerable sovereigns even spat out blood. The great Dao universe had been broken, and it was obvious that it came from the other two realms.Outside, battle cries filled the air.The light aura spread out and shook the surroundings. The light Emperor also raised his eyebrows and roared,""The four-sided light is here, surrender!"Damn it, he finally got his revenge!Previously, long Zhan impersonated me. This time, it's me here in person!As the three rank eights revealed their auras, the previously fearless reincarnation monarchs felt that three rank eights had fallen ... All of a sudden, they were a little dazed. At this moment, a saber swept across the sky and a rank seven reincarnation monarch was killed on the spot!A sword was thrown out, and the sky was shattered. Another seventh rank venerable sovereign was killed by the sword!A pair of fists suppressed the heavens. The veteran rank 7 God Emperor, the sun god, destroyed a rank 7 God Emperor with a single punch and laughed. Behind him, his disciple, the Heavenly King suppression, also laughed."Today, I will enter Grade 7!"It's finally my turn!If he didn't enter the seventh step, he wouldn't be able to survive.The tables had turned in an instant.A large number of venerable sovereigns began to fall on the two battlefields.[PS: I can't finish writing. I'll continue tomorrow. I'm too dizzy and weak. Sorry.]

3443 Chapter 558
The situation was reversed.The three rank eights had died in battle, and the reincarnation monarchs were beginning to fall. In the realm, some rank seven venerable sovereigns were even preparing to escape.It was too horrifying!The sudden turn of events was hard for them to accept. In the blink of an eye, several level 8s and many Level 7s had died.When the auras of the Supreme Being and Emperor Cang were revealed, they knew that the two of them had left. Of course, at this moment, no one cared about this. They only knew that with the return of the two rank 8s, the 20 or so rank 7s could still be put up a fight.However, as they returned, their momentum was overwhelming ... More than twenty seventh rank venerable sovereigns would probably find it difficult to resist them together."Run!""What's going on?" some of the 10 seventh rank venerable sovereigns in the reincarnation realm had rushed out of the realm and escaped before Zhi Zun and the others returned.Light Supreme Emperor wanted to stop them, but it would be a little troublesome for him to stop so many venerable sovereigns by himself.At this moment, they could only keep an eye on a few and not let them escape. Their main goal was to deal with Samsara.At this moment, it seemed that a battle had broken out in the square domain. However, it was too far away from the Thunder domain. The realms in the nearby regions might be concerned, but the other venerable sovereigns did not.The experts were all concerned about the war in the reincarnation realm.At this moment, the level eight venerable sovereigns of the other worlds, including the extreme Ice world, were all shocked. They kept sending messages to all parties, asking if they should join the battle or not.To participate in the battle?Just as such a thought appeared, there was a change in the realm.In the eighth heaven.A world suddenly shook, and the great Dao shook. In the next moment, countless sorrowful cries rang out."Sector Lord!"BOOM!The sound spread in all directions. Some of the venerable sovereigns nearby were shocked and looked over. Some were shocked. How could this be?It was a level eight world, the Heluo realm!The master of he Luo city had fallen!"What happened?""Why so?"The rank 7 Masters in the 7th Sky muttered to themselves, their faces pale.How many days has it been?Gemini was gone, reincarnation was almost gone, the world of sun and moon was gone, the shattered Earth world was gone, and now, even the Heluo realm was going to be gone. These were all level eight great worlds!16 level 8 worlds established the situation in the East.However, in just a few days, so many changes had happened, and one level eight venerable sovereign after another had fallen ... This was something that had not happened in a million years."It's in the direction of the Thunder region, the square region ..."Some experts sensed the situation and their expressions changed drastically.It was a battle that had broken out within the Thunder region.Those people had been severely injured in the square domain!It was the four-sided domain again!…… At this moment, Li Hao's group was in no mood to care about the square domain or the other level 8 powerhouses.Three rank eights had died, but the other side still had many rank eights. The four reincarnation deities were all there, so was the rank eight Primal Chaos expert, and there were also five other rank eight experts. All of them were very valiant ... With the exception of Fu Sheng.Under the leadership of the reincarnation Emperor, these people also burst out with powerful strength.Although the human King was strong and had recovered to his peak, the reincarnation Emperor no longer hid his surroundings and went all out. He killed the human King and forced him to retreat.At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor's face was extremely ugly.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Was the four-sided domain really so difficult to deal with?In the entire East, almost all the rank 8 worlds had sent experts to participate in the war. Some were here, while others had gone to the four-direction region. Now, all the regions were showing signs of decline.There were so many eighth level venerable sovereigns, but ... How many of them had died?In the blink of an eye, four rank eights had been killed.If it wasn't for the fact that a few of them had been resurrected and more had died, including the Twin universes ...So many eighth level venerable sovereigns had died.He looked around and suddenly felt a little desolate.Human King, Wu Shan, Dao Qi, and Thunderlord were all at level eight. Li Hao, er Mao, Kong Ji, Sen LAN ... Even the Dao master of Silvermoon universe was comparable to a level Seven when they worked together.In terms of strength, he wasn't completely suppressed. In fact, he wasn't even at a disadvantage.But ... If he did not do anything about it, the reincarnation realm might be completely destroyed!He had already sensed that several rank seven venerable sovereigns had died.p Some of the foreign venerable sovereigns also began to flee when they were in a disadvantageous position. In fact, they still had a chance. Although a few rank eights had died, their peak combat strength had not been completely destroyed.At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor looked at the human king who was flying backward. There was no longer anger or disgust in his eyes, only calmness.It was very difficult to kill!So many venerable sovereigns had surrounded the killer king and killed him until now, but they still couldn't kill him. They had too many tricks up their sleeves.The reversal of yin and yang, was that all?Perhaps ... There were more.As for Li Hao, he could control time and might be even harder to kill than a level 8.The East had already been defeated.The reincarnation monarch didn't say anything. At this moment, he punched out and the universe of the great path appeared and cracked. He looked around coldly and shouted,""Retreat!"Return to the reincarnation realm!"You want to leave?"Even though the human King was covered in blood, he let out a roar and slashed out with his blade, trying to stop them.Samsara was actually retreating.That's right, even eight rank eights were unable to kill this group of people, and now there were still three less. If they didn't retreat, did they have to wait for the Supreme martial artist and the others to break through reincarnation?At that time, he would really be courting death.Li Hao and the others also tried to stop them. Great DAOs and chaos exploded, trying to stop these people from retreating.However ... The reincarnation Emperor was still a top-notch being.

As for the human Kings, they were weak on the inside and had reached their limits. Although they could still fight, they were no match for the Samsara Emperor. The Samsara side might even have a chance to turn the tables.However ... If they lost their homeland, their combat power would be damaged. At that time, they might be completely annihilated.At this moment, Li Hao's expression changed.If Samsara retreated, then so be it.Fu Sheng couldn't leave!He saw his own future in time. He withstood the sword of the future person and felt the power of the orderly great Dao. If the other party comprehended a little, it might even cause a huge impact.Not only would it interfere with reality, but it might even bring trouble to the future.Li Hao had only briefly come into contact with the power of an orderly great Dao, but his opponent had personally experienced it. If his comprehension was higher, he might even walk on a different great Dao.That would be a huge problem.Everyone could live, but Fu Sheng could not!He couldn't even give the other party a chance to resurrect.At this moment, there were still five rank eight powerhouses on Samsara's side. They were the last to leave and were the only venerable sovereigns who had a chance of being detained.If the Samsara Emperor wanted to leave through the Dao universe, it would be difficult for Li Hao's group to stop him, unless the Dragon Master was here.However, it was obvious that he would not. Moreover, if the Dragon Lord was really here, it was hard to say who he would deal with.Li Hao's eyes were cold. At this moment, he still attacked, but he was not as fierce as before. It seemed that he did not want to stop them and let them leave. Not far away, the human King was cursing. It seemed that he knew that it would be difficult to stop them.Fu Sheng, who was at the back, had already stepped into the reincarnation universe. He heaved a sigh of relief. It was so dangerous.Quickly run!If he didn't leave now, he was worried that he would die at the hands of this group of people again.At this moment, the Samsara monarch was also extremely vigilant and began to seal the Dao universe. The moment Fu Sheng stepped in, the crack in the Dao universe began to close. They were about to retreat.It was even better if the human King and the others didn't pursue.Otherwise, there would be some trouble.As he was thinking, Li Hao suddenly roared from behind. Time stars appeared, and the world seemed to reverse. Time seemed to flow backward, and the power of time only affected Fu Sheng.In that instant ...Venerable sovereign Fu Sheng, who had just stepped into the great Dao universe, seemed to take a few steps back. All of a sudden, he fell out of the great Dao universe, and the crack in the great Dao universe closed instantly!In the universe of the great path, the expression of the reincarnation Emperor changed slightly.Just as he was about to open the great Dao universe and bring Fu Sheng in, the level eight Primal Chaos expert beside him, who had been silent all this while, suddenly said in a muffled voice,""Let's go!"If he was really stopped, would he give up on the reincarnation realm?Out of the 14 rank-7s, a few had already died.Could this Fu Sheng be compared to so many Grade 7 experts?Moreover ... At this moment, this level eight chaos creature was also somewhat disgusted with Fu Sheng. If he had not been incompetent and failed to destroy Li Hao's time star, the current situation would not have happened.Trash!Pig-like teammate. It was better for such a person to die.There was no need to waste time for him. One must know that the Supreme Being and Emperor Cang were about to arrive at the world of reincarnation. Once the two rank eights joined the battle ... It might cause the complete collapse of reincarnation.He had already resurrected Fu Sheng once, and he had done his best.Reincarnation Emperor's face changed.At that moment, he also sensed the turbulence in the great Dao universe. Another level Seven venerable sovereign had fallen, and he could not delay any longer. If he opened the great Dao universe now and took Fu Sheng away, he might be held back, and that would be ... Troublesome.He sighed in his heart. Fu Sheng's talent was not weak.What a pity!However ... He couldn't help but feel a little angry. How many resources had this piece of trash used to enter level eight? how many resources had he used to resurrect?In the end, Li Hao, who wasn't even at his full strength, was actually forced to retreat.Forget it!Without looking back, the Samsara monarch led the other venerable sovereigns along the great Dao universe and headed straight for the Samsara realm.Outside, venerable monarch fleeting life's face was pale.In an instant, he felt the departure of the universe of the great path. His expression changed, and he roared,""Sector Lord!"The realm Lord actually left!He actually left!He was a descendant of the reincarnation Emperor. He was not just a random rank eight, but a direct descendant. Otherwise, the reincarnation Emperor would not have paid such a high price to resurrect him.But now, the sector Lord has the ability to stay and save me."I know time ..."He knew the secrets of time!He saw something and even felt something. At this moment, his body even contained some power of the future, the power of a special great Dao, the power of a rule.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  ,m To a level 8, it would be of great help. Sector Lord, you actually left!Even if we leave the reincarnation realm behind, it might not be as important as this rule force, do you know?You will regret this!There was a hint of madness and despair in venerable monarch fleeting life's eyes.You'll regret abandoning me.Do you think that I want to do this?"If it were you guys before, you would have been forced to retreat as well. Is that my responsibility?His heart was filled with unwillingness, anger, and resentment. At this moment, they were so thick that he couldn't say anything. He felt that he had tried his best, but he had failed. It wasn't his fault.Why do you want me to bear the responsibility?At this moment, he suddenly sneered, and a monstrous force emerged from his body. The power of his great Dao overflowed, and Li Hao and the others 'expressions changed slightly. Self-destruction?Venerable monarch fleeting life looked coldly in the direction of the turbulence in the void, where the fluctuations of the great path of the universe had disappeared.

"Realm Lord ... You will regret this sooner or later!""This battle wasn't my fault!"With anger and resentment, venerable sovereign fleeting life turned to look at Li Hao with a complicated expression. What kind of power was that sword?He wanted to know!At this moment, he really wanted to know."The power of that sword ... Can you tell me ... What kind of power is it?"From the side, the human King charged over with his saber and laughed,""Why would I tell you? wait for you to resurrect and leak the secret? You won't be satisfied even if you die!"This was the human King.Under normal circumstances, he would definitely not satisfy the enemy and let them die in grievance. Li Hao, on the other hand, slightly raised his eyebrows and said after some thought,""The laws!"He wasn't too clear about it, but he could roughly judge that it was a type of rule force.As for the secret of resurrection ... How could it be so easy? besides, even if everyone knew that the power of order was stronger, would it be enough to just know?I also know that when 10000 DAOs fuse into one, one is invincible.That would be level nine!I know, but is it useful?"Rules ..." Venerable monarch fleeting life muttered.The next moment, he looked at the human King with a relieved expression. This fellow was a bastard. It was normal for him to not say anything even if he knew. Furthermore, what the hell did he know?Venerable sovereign fleeting life laughed. The next moment, there was a loud bang!The heavens fell and the earth cracked!The main force was not focused on Li Hao, but on the human King. With a loud boom, the human King was sent flying, coughing up blood. He was not so weak, but he had reached his limit.Fu Sheng, this bastard, even when he was dead, he didn't split up and self-destructed. Instead, he self-destructed in a group to mess with him once!The human King was sent flying as he cursed,""You dog, you're really not a thing!""I love it when they hate me but can't get rid of me!" He laughed.He didn't feel bad about it. Instead, he was very happy.I like the way you are![You can't kill me, but you still want to kill me. I did suffer a little loss, but you're dead. You won't be happy even if you die. I'll make you angry!]The surrounding crowd looked at the human King.For a moment, she didn't know what to say.This ... Was the human King.When they looked at Li Hao, they couldn't tell who was older. The human King looked more like a teenager, while Li Hao ... Seemed to be in his late years.Everyone's mood was a little complicated.At this moment, everyone was injured. Li Hao exhaled. After killing Fu Sheng, he felt a little more at ease. He turned his head and looked at the human King."As for the Paragon ..." They didn't stop the four great emperors from returning.At this moment ...The human King laughed and said,"it's okay. I was beaten so badly this time because old Zhang and those guys misjudged me and thought that I wouldn't die. I was almost tricked to death by them ... Let him fight for a while ... With the three tier 8 experts around, he won't die so quickly!"Moreover, would the Samsara Emperor still fight with the neo Martial Emperor at this moment?……The reincarnation realm.The moment the Supreme Being and Emperor Cang arrived, the reincarnation Emperor returned at almost the same time.With the presence of the great path universe, their speed was much faster than that of the Supremes. Although the Supremes and Emperor Cang were nearby, both parties arrived almost at the same time.At this moment, there were a total of 24 seventh rank venerable sovereigns who had stayed behind.However ... Six of them had managed to escape.There were only 12 out of the 18 seventh level venerable sovereigns left. In just a short while, six of them had been killed by neo martial and Supreme sovereign of light!Samsara had 14 rank 7s. Four had died, and four had been revived last time, returning to their original state.The reincarnation Emperor arrived instantly.The Grandmaster also appeared and shouted,""Retreat!"Many of the new martial Supreme emperors retreated one after another.At the forefront, the bald Qin Fengqing was a little dissatisfied that he had not been able to kill his opponent with one slash. He wanted to continue with a few more slashes, but when he saw the aura of a rank-8 appearing around him, he retreated quickly, cursing and swearing. Although he was not afraid of death, he did not want to die either!Damn it, Fang ping and the rest actually failed to pin down their opponents.At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor looked at light and the others with a gloomy expression.Many people had died!  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Not only seventh level venerable sovereigns, but dozens of middle and low level venerable sovereigns had also died.These were all foundations.He then looked into the distance. Although it was extremely far away, at this moment, there seemed to be violent fluctuations within the lightning territory.He looked at Zhi Zun with cold eyes, but his tone was not heavy. He only said calmly,""The East has established itself in the level-16 world. Now that you've destroyed so many worlds, the East's strength has been greatly reduced ... The three overlords won't let this go easily!"Then, he chuckled and looked at the eighth rank venerable sovereign beside him.""I'll have to trouble fellow Daoist this time!"Only now did the rank 8 beast return to its original form.It was a beast so huge that it was impossible to see it. It was a fish ... Or a kun Peng?The incomparably huge Beast of Chaos opened its huge mouth and swallowed the world of reincarnation into its stomach. At this moment, the Samsara Emperor looked at the new martial artists and then at the surroundings. He sighed,""Today ... Our journey to become the Overlord of the East in the reincarnation realm will come to an end!"It was a little self-deprecating, but also a little emotional.He looked around and gave an order,""Retreat! Go to the West. Samsara has been defeated. Today, we will enter the West and enter the huntian realm!"The next moment, the giant kun Peng started to retreat with the world and a group of advanced venerable sovereigns.

He had wanted to continue to take root in the East, but the situation did not allow him to do so.He had been defeated!Four level 8s had died, and the other realms in the East would probably suffer heavy losses this time. At this point ... The only way was to retreat.To the West!Dongfang, he might come back again, but by then, he might not be the master anymore.At this moment, the new martial emperors all looked at the Supreme martial artist.However, Zhi Zun shook his head slightly. The other party's combat strength was still there. There were four level eights and more than ten level Sevens. If they continued to fight, there would still be a chance to make the other party stay when the human King and the others arrived, but ... Why did they have to do this?If they were to fight to the death and the other realms joined the battle, then today would be a battle to the death."Clean up the battlefield and ... Follow me to clean up all the realms where realm Lord Dongfang died ..."Long Zhan, since you've also killed a tier 8, then these worlds without a sector Lord, we, new martial, will take them.At this moment, even if there were still many level eights guarding the various places, the other party might not dare to fight with the new martial artists for the world with the dead sector Lord.All of a sudden, the group headed straight for the Heluo boundary.On the other side, an eighth level venerable sovereign had died.……Four regions.Eight tier 8 experts attacked, and the warring Dragon side only had four tier 8 experts: long Zhan, Red Moon, Black Tiger, as well as Feng Yan who had just advanced to tier 8.However, long Zhan's side, which only had four grade eight experts, had the advantage at this moment.A gargantuan Dragon, a Golden Dragon, soared through the skies.A Dragon had suppressed three level eight venerable sovereigns!On the other side, Hong Yue, hei Hu, and Feng Yan were also holding back the other level eight venerable sovereigns. A large group of Level Seven venerable sovereigns were surrounding them and killing them!At that moment, extreme frost Emperor was extremely powerful, yet he was still suppressed. He roared,"humans, why aren't you killing these chaos demonic beasts?"F * ck!He was also exploding with anger!Could it be that the humans of the four-sided domain had all run away?Only a bunch of weak chickens are left?There were dozens of seventh rank venerable sovereigns and dozens of seventh rank worlds at the periphery. But ... They had been fighting fiercely until now. It was obvious that the warring Dragon's side did not have any advantage previously. If they resisted now, there was a great chance that they could annihilate these guys. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In the end, not a single rank seven joined the battle.Not a single one!This was too unexpected.It wasn't that they were far away, but that they were nearby. They would be able to arrive soon, and it wasn't just one or two of them. If there were only one or two of them, it would be normal for them to be afraid of being killed by the shockwaves. However ... Dozens of seventh level venerable sovereigns were nearby! If they attacked together, even if they did not deal with long Zhan, they would have absolute confidence in killing those seventh rank venerable sovereigns.Not even one!It was too much for these outer region venerable sovereigns to handle. In their opinion, the human race venerable sovereigns in the square region were still crazy and brutal. They were extremely brutal, just like new martial and silver Moon.Why ... Did this place become like this? Long Zhan had unified the four regions for a very short time and did not have any business at all. Why did no one resist?Don't you know that chaos demonic beasts are beings that devour humans?Don't you know that they are extremely hostile to the human race?In the outer regions, beasts of primordial chaos were slaves. How could a slave make the decision?The group of human venerable sovereigns on the outside had complicated looks in their eyes, but none of them made a move.The Dragon Lord's might was too great!This was the first reason. Secondly ... These guys from the outer region were not native to this place. If they couldn't win, they could still run.Was he waiting to be settled?Moreover, although long Zhan had oppressed them before, he had not destroyed their inheritance and world. Furthermore, the current Phoenix Flame sovereign was very friendly to the human race and had secretly saved many people ...All in all, at this moment, these seventh rank venerable sovereigns did not want to get involved.Spiky, they've all left.If new martial, Silver Moon, light, and Thunder World were still around, they might be able to lead the way. However, with the departure of these worlds, a batch of rank seven masters who dared to resist had been killed earlier ... At this time, those who remained were not willing to get involved.At this moment, the Dragon Lord's dragon roar reverberated through the heavens and earth, shaking the surroundings. He was fighting against three rank eight venerable sovereigns alone, but he was still able to suppress them. His huge eyes were cold."Extreme Ice, you're very bold!"I didn't even look for you, and you actually dared to invade the four-sided domain.He was really bold.Counting on these seventh-rank beasts to attack?How could that be possible?In the four-sided domain, the ambitious and troublesome rank-7s had either died or ran away. The ones left behind were a group of weaklings. Who would dare to help you?Even if the chaos race was defeated, there might not be anyone who would dare to resist.At this moment, extreme frost Emperor was extremely depressed.It was even a little difficult to get off!What to do?Should he escape?Or ... Should they continue the fierce battle?He was even worried that if this went on, the human race's venerable sovereigns would attack them.He Luo was dead.He died a terrible death.They weren't killed by the Dragon Lord but by a group of chaos beasts, seventh-tier chaos beasts. They were torn apart and surrounded. If this continued, they might end up like them.At this moment, extreme frost Emperor had completely given up on the idea of taking over the four-direction zone."Retreat!" He gritted his teeth and shouted.The venerable sovereigns fought crazily and started to retreat.Long Zhan didn't say much. He brought the primal Chaos race and chased them all the way. At this moment, if these guys wanted to retreat, it wouldn't be so easy. Furthermore, there was the lightning territory as a barrier. If these guys wanted to leave the lightning territory safely ... They had to leave a few behind!

His voice resounded in all directions,"leave a grade 8 behind and you can avoid paying Tributes for 10000 years!" Another reward of 1 billion great Dao crystals ..."At that moment, some of the human venerable sovereigns around them were getting restless.The venerable sovereigns of Extreme Ice became more depressed and fled frantically.'Damn it!'In this damn place, these weak human cultivators actually obeyed the orders of a Chaos Beast. It was really disappointing. He thought that everyone was like the new martial artist Silver Moon, but he had overestimated them.Very soon, The Great Hunt began!The rank seven venerable sovereigns he had brought with him were dying one after another. Those who fell behind were quickly killed on the spot.The remaining seven eighth rank venerable sovereigns were also running for their lives!It was only until they escaped into the Thunder region that long Zhan stopped chasing and stopped. At this moment, he had returned to his human form and looked out. He silently sensed something, and his eyes were filled with doubt and solemness.Another battle had broken out in the outer region.Who won and who lost?He was not sure, but he was puzzled. It had exploded so quickly. Li Hao and Fang Ping's group were too good at stirring up trouble.In this battle, among these foreign venerable sovereigns, almost none of the seventh-rank ones had escaped, but almost all of the eighth-rank ones had."Dragon Lord!" Beside him, Feng Yan was a little excited."Dragon Lord, aren't we going to chase after them?""No," she said.The Dragon Master shook his head and looked towards the Thunder region, saying in a low voice,""The outer region is in turmoil. Our chaos race only has a few level 8 experts. In the Eastern Region, there are 16 level 8 worlds and many level 8 venerable sovereigns ... If we really join forces ... We're clearly no match for them."However, were there still 16 left?The twins were gone, and it looked like there might be more this time.  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 He looked back at tianfang world in the distance. It was very far away, but at this moment, he could see clearly that tianfang world was brighter than before. A large number of venerable sovereigns had been killed this time, and there were even level eight venerable sovereigns ... Tianfang world seemed to have absorbed a lot of power of the great Dao.There were some signs of immediate recovery!​ ……In the outside world.With a thunderous boom, the few seventh level venerable sovereigns who had stayed behind to guard the Heluo realm were all killed in an instant. The universe of great Dao was taken away.The power of the world had been completely extracted.It was only at this moment that the human King and his group slowly arrived. The human King was panting heavily and had a furious expression on his face as he glanced at the Grandmaster.The Grandmaster ignored him.It's good that he didn't die!He looked at Li Hao and the others behind him and cupped his fists.""Thank you for your help!"This was Li Hao's first time meeting a new martial Supreme face-to-face, or rather, in real life. At this moment, he glanced at the white-haired man who looked like a celestial being. However, the Supreme in his memory was not like this.Instead, he was extremely young. Had he aged after a thousand years, or was he doing this on purpose?He almost didn't recognize her."Silvermoon Li Hao greets senior!"Li Hao replied politely, then looked at Zhang an, who was beside him. At this moment, Zhang an's injuries had not yet recovered, and his whole body was pitch black. He glanced at his grandfather, who he had been very afraid of in his early years.At this moment, he was not as afraid as before. However, he still felt a little indignant. They hadn't even met yet, and he had already been tricked by his grandfather and almost burned to death!At this moment, seeing Li Hao looking at him, he obviously felt that he might have to go back ...However, Zhang an was unwilling.He glanced at the crowd of new martial artists and was a little disappointed. He didn't see that person ...He then looked at his grandfather, his father, his brother, and his sister in the crowd ... They had all become venerable sovereigns.He didn't say anything and only nodded to his grandfather. He didn't mention going back at all.As for the Grandmaster, he glanced at his pitch-black grandson and smiled.It was a meaningful smile!He was quite bold. Of course, this was good. He had been suppressed too much in new martial arts. For many years, his grandson had not even become a Heavenly King, let alone a venerable sovereign. Now, he had entered the level of a third stage venerable sovereign, which was not bad.At this moment, they were not the only ones who met their relatives.There was also the celestial pole.On Silver moon's side, Heaven's Fate, who was at the back of the crowd, also saw his old father. Similarly, his old father was also at the back of the neo martial artists, looking somewhat bored.The father and son looked at each other and quickly shifted their gazes away.Don't look at me, I'm not looking at you.Father and son, each on one side. If one dies, there's still one left.Besides, there were too many people lying flat on the ground. It was too conspicuous.One on each side, no one would care.The father and son were both lying here ... That would be too conspicuous.A tacit understanding!The father and son did not acknowledge each other at all. They just looked at each other from a distance and it was over.He had many relatives.For example, li Fuhai from Li Hao's side. His father and patriarch were all venerable sovereigns. They were also among the neo martial artists, but ... As if Kong Yu had a tacit understanding, no one mentioned their return.Zhi Zun, on the other hand, sized Li Hao up, then looked at the level eight venerable sovereigns, and finally at Kong Ji.At this moment, Kong Ji wasn't blind. He naturally recognized his old father, but ... He was too embarrassed to do so, because he realized that Li Hao's people hadn't returned to their families.Was it appropriate for him to acknowledge his old father?It was still the light Emperor who spoke first,""Mingtang, you've reached Level Seven ... Not bad!"Kong Ji was a little embarrassed and said,""Father!"Then, he turned to Yao yang and the other venerable sovereigns and said,""Dear uncles ..."Then, he didn't know what to say.What should I say?The two of them met, and at this moment, the atmosphere was a little awkward!At this moment, Li Hao took the initiative to break everyone's mood. He said,""Senior human King has returned safely. I won't disturb you any longer!"

3448 Chapter 558
Samsara has already withdrawn from the East, and the East is in chaos ... If neo martial has the intention to dominate the East, we can help if we need help ...""The East is very big, and the other three forces are very strong," Grandmaster said with a smile."Little friend, have you ever thought about ... Dominating the East with me, neo martial?""Then forget it."Li Hao shook his head."I'm not good at management, and my friends don't like to be confined to one place. They prefer to wander around. Everyone gathered for their interests, for their cultivation techniques, and for the sake of seeking Dao. If they wanted to dominate ... It might have been safer for them to stay in the square domain."Seeing this, the Grandmaster didn't say much. After some thought, a book of Dao suddenly appeared in his hand. He threw it to Li Hao and smiled."This time, it's all thanks to your help that Fang ping is fine. Otherwise, I'm afraid that I would have been beaten to death by others ... Since you're here for Dao seeking, this book of great Dao contains some of my comprehensions over the years. It might not be of much help, but it can be used as a reference ..."Li Hao was a little shocked. He glanced at the Supreme martial artist.Grandmaster laughed and said,"the new martial artist Silver Moon was originally one family ... Of course, even if they split up, they're still considered brothers!" The chaos is very big but also very small. However, there are many experts. Spring and autumn in the south, five elements in the North, chaos in the West ... Now, Samsara has also gone to the West. The strength of the West has increased greatly. In the future, there will definitely be a fierce battle. There will be a War of Dragons behind ... The East may not be a good place!""It's good for you, it's good for us ... Since we're in this era, there's no way we can stay out of this ...""This time, you've saved Fang ping. Neo martial arts has nothing to repay you with ... I'll give the book of great Dao to you, young friend!"  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  A book of the great path, a Supreme Being's book of the great path, was no small matter.In Li Hao's opinion, it might be more precious than an eighth-tier great universe. At this moment, he felt a little embarrassed. "There's no need to do this. Back then, when I left the Stargate, it was also thanks to ..." "Let's do this!""By the way, we've broken through Heluo, lietu, and sun Moon realms and killed many seventh level venerable sovereigns ..." Grinned Zhi Zun.Before he could finish, a cat, who had been staring at second cat curiously, suddenly stretched out its paw. There seemed to be a super huge fish in its paw. It pushed the big fish over and its eyes were full of joy."Second cat, here's your fish!"At first, second cat didn't want to pay attention to it, but seeing that it was happy, it pushed another big fish over ... Second cat actually recognized it. It was the earth-splitting realm, which was extremely huge and compressed by big cat.It was a rank eight world!Such a big fish was no ordinary fish.Second cat had mixed feelings. He looked at big cat and muttered,""I don't eat fish!""Why don't cats eat fish?" big cat was confused.The two almost identical cats were hard to tell from an outsider's point of view. Now, they were both gathered here, but Li Hao could tell at a glance who was the big cat and who was the second.It was not strength, but ... Temperament. The big cat had the temperament of a Street Rascal, but it also had a lazy and pure feeling ...It was an eighth-grade cat, an extremely ferocious cat, but it gave people a feeling of innocence.Second cat, on the other hand, looked more like an older brother.Ermao didn't say anything. It watched as bigcat pushed the big fish towards it. Soon, the compressed world landed in front of it. Ermao had mixed feelings and muttered,"You can eat it yourself!""I still have many ..."The big cat seemed to be very happy and showed off its collection. A fish pond seemed to appear in front of it, and there were indeed many fish swimming in it. Li Hao glanced at it, his eyes flickering, but he didn't say anything.They were actually ... All powerful venerable sovereigns, or the manifestations of worlds!This big cat was indeed as brutal as the rumors had said!"Senior second cat ... Please accept Emperor Cang's kind intentions!"Li Hao didn't want to get involved, but seeing that Emperor Cang was at a loss, he decided to speak up.When second cat heard this, he hesitated. He looked at big cat and then at the human King. The human King didn't seem to care, but second cat still said,""Human King, the big cat following you ... Was its choice, and it was also your choice ... I didn't mean to say anything, and I have no right to say anything, but the big cat has killed too many people over the years ..."The human King raised his eyebrows and smiled. He looked at second cat and said,"Nonsense, cats don't kill people or fight. We're just fishing!"Then, he looked at second cat and Li Hao and smiled.""Li Hao, second cat, Wu Shan, Thunderlord ... You saved me this time. I owe you a favor. It's just that ... Our pursuits are ultimately different! Let's not beat around the bush. If you need any help, just let me know. However ... There's no need for us to stick together, otherwise ... If time passes and our relationship fades, it'll be bad!"The venerable sovereigns on both sides changed their expressions when they heard this.The new silver Moon was extremely powerful at this moment.Both sides had several level eight venerable sovereigns and quite a number of Level Seven venerable sovereigns. If they joined forces, it would not be difficult for them to dominate the East, even if they could not sweep it clean.However, the human King did not seem to have such intentions.And Li Hao didn't seem to have such intentions.Li Hao exhaled and nodded,'senior human King is right! The human King is honest and forthright, and I don't want to be dominated by others. The chaos is right here. Senior human King, if you need anything, you can find me at any time to drink wine and tea. I'm always waiting for you!"

3449 Chapter 558
The human King laughed,"that's good!" The earth-splitting world was a gift from big cat, so second cat should just accept it! In the past, in the illusionary realm, second cat, you also helped me ... And also helped big cat. This is a gift for our first meeting, and also a gift to thank you. There's no need to be polite!""Old Zhang's book of Dao is just like that ...""This time, the four eighth level venerable sovereigns were all killed by you, and you saved me ... I don't want the spoils. Also ..." He smiled.Li Hao said,"there's no need for anything else. It's enough!" As of now, none of us need to advance to the 8th step, so this will be enough for me to advance to the 7th step. Many thanks for your help, senior!"It was enough.As for Sun Moon and Heluo, they had fought their own battles. The rank-7s they had killed were also killed by the neo martial artists, so everyone had to split them up."Satisfying!"The human King laughed,"alright, then it's settled!" "In addition, my new martial might continue to wipe out the eastern worlds in the near future. Although it's not the goal to dominate a region, since I'm out, I can't always be someone else's underling. I don't have this habit! "If you want the East, then I, new martial arts, will find another area to establish myself in ...""No need!"​ Li Hao shook his head."However, I'll probably stay in the East for a while in the near future. I'll set up some things and perfect my mantras. I hope that you can help me.""That's up to you!"Ren Wang didn't say much. At this moment, there were still many worlds in the East, but in the mouth of the two, they seemed to have become neo martial arts.They were decisive.As for the radiance Supreme Emperor, he was a little depressed at the moment. He had only spoken a few words with his son.And ... Why didn't you all join forces?To be honest, he could not quite understand.Both sides were very strong, but it was not to the extent of being invincible. If that was the case, they would not have been surrounded and killed this time. It might be better for them to join forces at this moment.Why did they ... Have to split up?Should I go to the other side to accompany my son, or should I stay?While he was still thinking, Kong Ji took the initiative to transmit his voice,""Father, I'll take my leave first! "The emperors of the world of light should stay at neo martial for the time being. Neo martial will definitely take root and won't wander around forever. It's more suitable for father ... And I ... Like to go out and see, walk ...""You've been away for many years!"Light Thearch couldn't help but transmit his voice.You're already at the seventh rank, aren't you going home?"No! Father, I can do whatever I want here. If I return and go with neo martial, although it's good, zhizun and renwang will give me some pressure. I'd better go with brother Haoyue. "The radiance Thearch was speechless. Don't I feel any pressure?Just as he was about to say something, Kong Ji sent another message, "It's better for father to go with neo martial. If father comes to Silvermoon ... Brother Haoyue will feel uncomfortable. You're my father, and he's my friend ... It'll be awkward for a friend's father to be here. "è‰¹!Are you still my son?The radiance Thearch was extremely depressed.So, you don't want your father anymore?You're not a thing!Fortunately, you haven't started a family yet. Otherwise, do you still have me in your eyes?The father and son talked to each other in secret. Li Hao looked at Zhang an and said,""Senior Zhang, even if you don't go back, there's still a group of students at Yuanping martial arts university ... Including some ancient city cultivators. Perhaps their parents and relatives are in neo martial arts ... You should make some arrangements!"Zhang an nodded slightly.He looked at the crowd. Li Hao did not see the queen's sister as he remembered. He was a little confused, but he didn't care.Many venerable sovereigns were missing. He didn't know if they were inside the neo martial world or if they were out.That's good, so that Zhang an won't suffer another blow.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  "The road is long ... Seniors, I'll take my leave first!"Li Hao didn't say much. He talked to Zhang an for a while and told him to make arrangements to go to the central World Alliance City to find him at any time. He would stay there for a while.Zhang an nodded. He did not want to go back, but some of the neo martial artists still wanted to return. Naturally, he had to make arrangements.Soon, the two sides parted ways.Watching them leave, the Grandmaster glanced at them for a long time before transmitting his voice to the human King,""Is this the kind of life you're looking forward to?"The human King looked on silently. After a while, he transmitted a message,""It's good to be free, and I'm looking forward to it ... However, being free for a while is enough. I'm different from him. This fellow ... Is very heartless."The Grandmaster stared blankly for a moment, and after a long time, he nodded, not saying anything.Was he heartless?He couldn't really tell, but since the human King said so, perhaps it was true.This guy seemed to have had enough fun and should be back.
