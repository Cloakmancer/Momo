The three of them instantly became one.In the distance, the red moon master glanced at the three of them, then at the Sen LAN sector Lord. Her expression was cold, but she didn't say anything. She turned around and was about to step through space to capture the three of them!Capturing the Silver Moon King would be the same.Find the Silvermoon world and reverse track neo martial's whereabouts. Neo martial can't hide from me!Sector Lord Sen Lan's expression changed again!What to do? According to the original plan, he should resist and stall the other party, but ... AI Hong was still here!Even if he made a move and AI Hong stopped him, Red Moon master would be able to take them down.Furthermore, if he were to make a move now ... He might instead be met with retaliation!What to do?Li Hao and the other two, who were running away, all felt a fatal crisis. Even venerable the sword turned pale.If sector Lord Sen LAN didn't stop them ... Even if a type 8 venerable sovereign came to capture them, let alone sword venerable, even a human King might not be able to fight against this type 8 venerable sovereign.If he could win, the human King would have killed him long ago."Boost me up. Backtrack. Give me seven or eight slashes ..."At this moment, even if second cat and the others appeared, it might not be of any use, because the red moon Lord had completely withdrawn and might attack by force. Thus, Li Hao did not even inform second cat and the others to attack.I can't attack!Otherwise, they would be wiped out in one fell swoop. Now, they could only hope to escape if they kept strengthening the sword venerable ... It was a very small chance.If sector Lord Sen LAN didn't act ... They would be in deep trouble this time!The two of them appearing at the same time was beyond everyone's expectations. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Just as the few of them had expressions of determination on their faces and were about to escape, behind them, the Senlan sector Lord's expression changed again. Whether he should act or not had become his biggest choice.He attacked and completely offended Hong Yue.If he didn't make a move ... If the new martial Swordmaster and the Silvermoon King died here, the new martial would not let this matter rest. But if the Son of God of light died here ... Would the Lord God of light let this matter rest?The next moment, he made a decision.With a furious roar, the world behind him became one.A powerful aura swept across the world!"Don't you dare leave!""Red Moon master, you attacked my Sen LAN. Don't you have an explanation?"With a punch, the chaos exploded!AI Hong was stunned!I'm here, and you ... My master is also here. You ... You still dare to attack?You just advanced to the seventh step!Are you crazy?Had the Sen LAN sector Lord gone mad? At that moment, several auras appeared in the distance. They were from several major cosmos absolute beings from other directions. When they sensed this place, they were all dumbfounded!This was crazy!This was crazy!As for the forest orchid sector Lord, he roared out,"the two of you are so bold. You've come all the way here. Don't you want the land of the Crimson Moon?" Once the new martial artists come, or the three major worlds join forces to invade the Crimson Moon, what can you do to stop them?"The three major worlds around him trembled slightly.The Crimson Moon Lord ... Was no longer in the Crimson Moon!AI Hong was also not there.At this moment ... At this moment ... They had to be more courageous. Sector Lord Senlan, this lunatic, if ... If they could hold him off for a while, they could destroy the entire Crimson Moon and swallow it up. Then ... Would they have a chance to reach the 8th level?Red Moon master's expression changed!Just like how Li Hao and the others didn't expect the two venerable sovereigns to be here, he also didn't expect that under such circumstances, the Senlan realm Lord would still have the guts to attack him.This was how war was, how unpredictable it was!It was unpredictable!He didn't expect that a guy who had just advanced to the next level would be so bold!A powerful aura exploded from behind!AI Hong didn't think of it, so she didn't stop him. As for Red Moon master, although he was a level eight venerable sovereign, he wasn't in his own territory. His expression changed slightly, and he turned to look at the Sen LAN realm Lord coldly. In an instant, a Red Moon appeared!"You're looking for death!"A cold shout resounded through the primal Chaos. BOOM!The red moon covered the sky and the universe above sector Lord Sen Lan's head instantly appeared. With a loud rumble, the entire universe shook and the entire forest cotton shook!The mountain collapsed and the earth cracked!And at this moment, Li Hao's expression changed. He really dared to make a move ... To be honest, this time, it was out of Li Hao's expectations. He knew that sector Lord Sen LAN wasn't a good person, and he was also someone with wild ambitions ...Therefore, Li Hao wasn't surprised at all that the other party didn't attack. It was very normal.But ... If he made a move ... This guy was not normal!In the next moment, Li Hao's aura of the great Dao fluctuated.In the distance, a book of the great Dao suddenly appeared. It carried the weight of ten thousand worlds. Ten thousand worlds appeared. A cat appeared between heaven and earth. The Supreme voice rang out with a slight smile."Yueming, cangjiang, and tianlan, I'll stop the two pieces of trash, Hongyue, and you'll attack Hongyue directly. The Hongyue will shatter, and neo martial will kill the two of you. New martial arts clearly distinguish between kindness and hatred. Hahaha, I originally wanted to seize the red moon realm, but today, I may be able to kill the red moon master. The heavens are helping me!""Meow ... Eat the fish!"The voice of Emperor Cang rang out. In an instant, in the distance, in the illusion, the river of the great Dao swirled. A world exploded in two cats 'body. In an instant, the power of the world appeared!The new martial arts were here!At that moment, Red Moon master, AI Hong, Senlan sector Lord, and even the venerable sovereigns of the three worlds were all stunned.New martial!They ... Were really there!Sword Saint was also overjoyed. He turned around and looked at Red Moon master. He laughed,""Kill him!"In an instant, sword intent emerged. Li Hao reversed time, no longer caring about anything else.

Kong Ji was also extremely crazy. He quickly condensed a flower, just like the last time he cooperated with the kill on awakening ... Although the three of them knew that the neo martial was fake, but ... At this time, they couldn't escape!If he fled, he would not be the neo martial Swordmaster!A long sword appeared in the hands of the sword venerable, and his sword intent was superimposed!In just an instant, one sword, two swords, three swords, Four Swords!This time, Li Hao also exerted all his strength. Compared to last time, the three of them had improved a little. The four Swords overlapped, and an extremely powerful sword intent emerged. Venerable the sword laughed,"Today, longevity swordsman has defeated a rank eight. Hundun congratulates me!"A Heavenly Sword slashed towards Red Moon master!The extremely powerful sword intent made AI Hong a little afraid. Red Moon master punched out and forced forest orchid master back. Her expression changed!Not good!Neo martial was here.Damn it!I bet they're not nearby ...Once they were entangled with him, the venerable sovereigns of the three great worlds would really attack his homeland, and he would be in great trouble. Without saying anything, he instantly tore the world apart, the void cracked, and the great Dao universe emerged!"Aihong!""Die!" With a low growl, Celestial Emperor Ai Hong was shocked. He instantly understood and entered the great Dao universe. Red Moon master took advantage of the fact that the other party had yet to attack and instantly opened the great Dao universe, causing the great Dao to shake!He had forcefully sent the AI Hong Supreme Emperor back!In the distance, the world of the Crimson Moon rippled. The next moment, the AI Hong sovereign appeared and roared,""All venerable sovereigns, gather!"In an instant, a large number of venerable sovereigns in the Crimson Moon world quickly gathered in fear!It's finished!Neo martial attacked!Red Moon master's face was cold.ai Hong had gone back, and the three world Lords would not dare to attack rashly. He only had to deal with this group of people, but ... It would be very troublesome!Sector Lord Sen LAN was at the seventh step. At this moment, revered sword was displaying the strength of the seventh step. There was still Emperor Cang. Once he used the strength of the human ruler, there was still the missing sun god and the unknown strength of the new martial Supreme ...His expression had already changed!Perhaps, I should retreat and return to the Crimson Moon to defend!However, he was still unwilling to accept it!Red Moon was the main attacker. Now, they had encountered neo martial, the neo martial that he had been looking for, but he had taken the initiative to retreat ... Wouldn't that be a joke?No matter what, he had to test the strength of neo martial!Peak combat strength!BOOM!The sword intent clashed with the Crimson Moon. The sword intent was dispersed while the Crimson Moon trembled slightly. Even though Swordmaster had stacked Four Swords and was incomparably strong, at this moment, he still couldn't fight against the Crimson Moon. Behind him, sector Lord Senlan didn't know whether it was true or not but he couldn't care about it anymore!Attack!BOOM!The great Dao of forest burst forth, boundless nature! At the same time, the other three great worlds ... Their first choice was not to attack the Crimson Moon, nor to rush over to help. Instead ... They moved quickly with the great worlds!Perhaps, he should escape! If they helped Hong Yue now, they were afraid that neo martial would win and kill them.However, if he didn't help the Crimson Moon ... Was he really going to attack the Crimson Moon world?They had such an idea before, but AI Hong had returned to the red moon and suppressed the world with dozens of venerable sovereigns. It would not be easy to attack. If it was before, they would have really been tempted."Do you guys really think that an eighth-rank can be killed so easily?""Die!" Red Moon master shouted in a low voice. The power of the red moon appeared and suppressed the world, turning chaos red!A powerful force swept in all directions!BOOM!With a loud explosion, the powerful power of the great path shook the three of them. At the same time, their bodies cracked. The three of them were in sync and flew back as if they were attacked. The chaos was shattered.The three of them flew backward and fled straight in the direction of neo martial!Red Moon master didn't chase after them. He had to first suppress sector Lord Sen LAN. After suppressing him, when the new martial arrived, he would gather all his strength to fight with them. The three of them fleeing now suited his intentions. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt He unleashed his full power and unleashed the Crimson Moon!BOOM!The forest orchid sector Lord's Dao trembled intensely, his heart shaking. A level 8 was so strong!No wonder a level eight was the true Overlord of chaos. In his own territory, in his Shenglan world, he was suppressed by the red moon!He instantly spat out a mouthful of black blood, and his body shattered. He turned his head and glanced at Li Hao and the others ... If neo martial really came, he might have a chance to take down Red Moon Lord!However, in an instant, he saw something. In the distance, Li Hao and the other two, who were frantically running away, seemed to feel the gaze. Li Hao waved his hand, as if to say ... Goodbye!Sector Lord Sen Lan's heart shook!The next moment, he realized something. Buzz!I ... Might be overthinking.His expression changed slightly as he saw a few people over there join up with new martial ... The red moon master was madly attacking him. His expression changed and he hurriedly shouted,""I surrender!"“……”The red moon Lord was stunned for a moment. The Sen LAN sector Lord was so crazy. He thought that this guy had already reached an agreement with new martial and light. This time, he was plotting against Red Moon to destroy her!In the end ... What happened?He was willing to surrender?The Sen LAN realm Lord roared again,"I'm willing to surrender to Hong Yue. I'm just unwilling to be invaded. However, Xin Wu is my enemy. I will never collude with Xin Wu. If you don't believe me, I, Sen LAN, am willing to merge with Hong Yue!" Kill the neo martial expert, kill the neo martial human King, and avenge my forest path master!"World fusion!The venerable sovereigns who were fleeing with the three major worlds were all stunned.You were ... You were so crazy just now. We all thought you colluded with new martial and might destroy the red moon today. Good guy, what do you mean?

Chapter 2962 The Plan Is Completed (8)
Suddenly, he turned his back on them and wanted to kill the neo martial artists?Although Red Moon master was strong, he was also shocked by this sudden change!To be honest, he didn't believe that the Senlan realmlord would suddenly attack and then surrender. But ... But the other party wanted to merge with the world ... This ... This made it more believable!He didn't have time to think too much when the Senlan realm Lord suddenly revealed his Dao universe. He revealed an opening and hollered,""Red Moon sovereign, please quickly refine my forest orchid realm and kill the new martial human King to avenge my forest orchid!"“……”Even the great path universe had been directly contributed. A seventh-level venerable sovereign, a world Lord, had directly revealed his core origin. This kind of surrender was complete!Even red Moon master did not expect such a turn of events ... But such an opportunity was too rare.Especially since neo martial was right next to him.His expression changed slightly, but he instantly regained his calm."The master of forest orchid merging with me is the best choice. I won't mistreat anyone in forest orchid!" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt After saying that, he didn't stand on ceremony anymore. The meat was right in front of his eyes, so why didn't he eat it?He instantly revealed his great Dao universe, and a star appeared. It directly tunneled into the forest orchid universe. At this time, he had to race against time and quickly merge with a seventh-tier universe! Even he himself felt that it was too smooth!The heavens are helping me!The new martial human King had killed the forest orchid path master. He had thought that the forest orchid path master would be happy, but in the end ... The forest orchid path master really held a grudge!At this critical moment, he gave up all resistance and took the initiative to merge with the red moon!The heavens were on his side. It seemed that even chaos did not want neo martial to succeed.He revealed a smile!A powerful force swept across the entire world. Red Moon master laughed loudly."Emperor Cang, those who obtain the Dao will receive more help, while those who lose the Dao will receive less help! You, new martial arts, are arrogant and despotic. You wantonly slaughtered the venerable sovereigns in all directions. Today is also the time for you to be devoured!"If the neo martial human King had not killed the forest orchid path master, he would not have had the opportunity to incorporate a seventh-order world so easily!In the distance, second cat, who had met up with Li Hao and the others, also said in a loud voice,""Foolish fellow! Senlan? You actually gave up on your own world and integrated into a world like the Crimson Moon ... Stupid!"After saying that, the huge cat immediately fled.Red Moon master frowned slightly. Did these guys give up on fighting me?He wanted to fight with the other, but at this moment, he was rapidly merging with the forest world. If he attacked, it would cause the world to shake, and the merging would not go smoothly.According to the rumors, shouldn't the new martial artist be launching an attack now to stop me from refining the seventh-tier great Dao universe?Strange! Of course, he couldn't care about this now. He had to refine Sen LAN first. A seventh level universe would allow him to recover some of his Yuan Qi. Moreover, the Sen LAN sector Lord had merged with the red moon and became the second seventh level venerable sovereign. With AI Hong, there were two seventh level venerable sovereigns. He could totally refine Sen LAN first and then go and kill him!Such a thought appeared in his mind, and he gave up on taking the initiative to attack.But at this moment, a venerable sovereign suddenly appeared in the forest world. With anger and fear, he hurriedly shouted,""You guys ... I'm still here ..." He said.Who was this person?Red Moon master was stunned. That person seemed to have felt boundless fear. He trembled and suddenly knelt down on the regional wall. His face was filled with fear, which shocked countless venerable sovereigns.This ..."Lady Hong Yue, this is a smokescreen!"The man roared,"a smokescreen!" That's not the neo Martial Emperor Cang, that's just a projection of a cat in the Silvermoon world that looks like Emperor Cang. That's also not the Supreme, that's the grandson of the Supreme. They lied to you, they want to escape, the neo martial isn't even nearby!"This person's face was pale."I ... I am the new martial artist, King Huai. They agreed that everyone would retreat together ... I'm still here, but they ran away!"His entire body trembled as he knelt on the ground and prostrated himself in the chaos. "I'm king Huai of the new martial world ... No, I'm not anymore, Lady Hong Yue. The only real experts are sword venerable and longevity sword ... They were the ones who killed the previous awakening God Thearch! Because they felt that I and the other rogue cultivators were weak, they told us to hide in Senlan for the time being and wait for the opportunity ... But Senlan ... Senlan ... Merged with the Crimson Moon!"It was as if the forest orchid had merged with the red moon, making him feel an endless danger of death. At this moment, King Huai did not care about the face of the venerable sovereign. He knelt on the ground, trembling. "They're all fake! "The homeland of new martial isn't nearby at all. The Supreme martial artists and the human King have a big plan. Their target ... Is not the red moon's homeland, but just to contain the red moon. They seem to ... Possibly be plotting against Tian Fang. I'm not too sure. I only know that the Misty Mountain Thearch killed the red moon Thearch because he reached an agreement with the Silver Moon King Li Hao. They're in cahoots and are plotting against Tian Fang ..."Red Moon master's face changed!Fake?Huai King?King Huai of new martial arts, the number one person who was afraid of death!Was this true or false?In the next moment, he couldn't care much anymore. In an instant, he teleported far away, and those people seemed to have disappeared completely. His eyes changed and he was instantly furious!I ... I've been tricked!Damn it!Bastard!Where was he?He was very fast, but in the blink of an eye, those people had disappeared.……On the other side, sector Lord Sen LAN glanced at King Huai who was kneeling on the ground. For a moment, he was in a daze.

Chapter 2963 The Plan Is Completed (1)
This ... Was he really betraying neo martial or ... Acting?He wasn't sure!Even the most cowardly venerable sovereigns had their dignity. Even if they surrendered, they would not be so ... Humble!He was like an ant, completely without the face of a venerable sovereign.He had heard that the new martial King Huai was afraid of death, but ... Was he really ... Was he really afraid of death to this extent?King Huai, who was prostrating on the ground, trembled. At this moment, two venerable sovereigns appeared behind him with complicated looks in their eyes. They looked at King Huai and were somewhat absent-minded.Had she really betrayed Li Hao and the others?They didn't know!They felt King Huai's fear, humbleness, and hatred ... It was as if he had completely lost his will to fight because Li Hao had given up on them. A venerable sovereign knelt on the ground and trembled in front of countless people.Even an itinerant cultivator wouldn't be like this!The referee and Chan Xiu did not say a word.They were also afraid of death. They were itinerant cultivators, and surrendering to the strong was as easy as drinking water for them. But ... But ... In front of billions of people and many world Lords, they could not accept kneeling down like this!Venerable sovereigns still had some dignity after all!King Huai did not care about anyone's gaze. He lowered his head, prostrated, and there was only fear and panic in his eyes ...Just like that year!He was born a slave!Step by step, he had reached the level of venerable sovereigns. In the terrifying place of neo martial, he had made it to this day. Even people from the celestial pole felt ashamed of their inferiority. He naturally had his own way of survival!A moment later, the red moon master appeared. She looked coldly at the few of them, then at the Sen LAN sector Lord and nodded. She then looked at King Huai and her eyes flickered. She said coldly,"How can they run so fast?" King Huai's entire body trembled."It should be ... It's probably possible that they made preparations in advance. Digging a hole in the chaos, I don't know how they did it. I only know that the human King and the sword venerable are experts in this path. Many experts in the new martial arts world know this and can open up a second space in the chaos!"How was that possible?The next moment, Red Moon master understood, and her expression changed slightly. The embryonic form of the world ... This meant that venerable the sword was about to enter Level Seven!No wonder he disappeared in an instant!He looked at King Huai again, his eyes cold and sharp."Get up!"King Huai trembled and stood up in an instant, his face full of fear."Please don't kill me, Lady Hong Yue. I know a lot of new martial arts secrets and things. I have integrated into the Sen LAN Avenue. Sen LAN has joined Hong Yue, and so have I. I will never betray you ..."Then, he turned around and pointed at Chan Xiu,""They ... They are the subordinates of the Silver Moon King, Li Hao. They are unaffiliated cultivators. They don't know any secrets. You can kill them as a sacrifice to deter the new martial artists ..."Red Moon master snorted.Killing two unknown non-affiliates to deter new martial ... Are you crazy?Chan Xiu and Yan's expressions changed again and again, but they did not say anything at this moment. They only lowered their heads with some uneasiness and fear. In their hearts, they were already cursing. King Huai ... Might really have betrayed them!'Damn it!'This was a neo martial artist?è‰¹!The two of them felt a little helpless and uneasy. Didn't they say that neo martial artists would not surrender even if they self-destructed?Even if it was an act ... Could it be so real?Little did he know that the words 'rogue cultivator, don't know any secrets'... Could save his life!They were just itinerant cultivators and didn't know the secret. Now that they had merged with the Crimson Moon, what was the point of killing them? Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  King Huai's ability was only at the second stage, but he was able to preserve his life in countless dangers. It was not something that ordinary venerable sovereigns could understand.

2964 Chapter 487
Primal Chaos void.The group of people kept on escaping and hiding in the caves. They would only come out and change caves when there was no one else around.The chaotic hole showed its benefits at this time.In a cave.The group of people was extremely quiet, and no one dared to even breathe loudly.Today was an exciting day.Facing a rank eight venerable sovereign!Li Hao, Kong Ji, and venerable sword were all quiet. They were all thinking about something. Li Hao had considered a lot, but there were still many accidents in the plan. The biggest accident was that two advanced venerable sovereigns from the Crimson Moon attacked at the same time!If it wasn't for sector Lord Sen Lan's decision to act at the last moment, he would have probably suffered a huge loss.Even if he pretended to be a neo martial artist ... Looking at Red Moon master's attitude, he was going to face neo martial directly and start a war. Neo martial. The neo martial that appeared couldn't deter the other party.He had underestimated the other party's determination!Level eight venerable sovereigns were more daring than he had imagined. He had hesitated several times before and did not arrive, which led to Li Hao's misjudgment. He thought that the enemy would definitely leave an advanced venerable behind.Of course, the final result was still going according to expectations, and it was slightly better than expected.In the worst case scenario, he would die once and bet that Red Moon master would not discover the secret of life and death. He would have a chance to be reincarnated. Fortunately, he did not use it.At this moment, Li Hao was a little worried.He was worried that King Huai and the other two wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure this time. He could only suppress his thoughts. The three venerable sovereigns who remained would be under immense pressure. Fortunately, the Senlan realm Lord had made the right choice at the last moment.It wasn't the kind of submission that was forced to be suppressed, but in a situation where they could resist, they would take the initiative to integrate into the Crimson Moon under the excuse that neo martial was a great enemy. Not only could it solve some problems, but it might also gain some trust.After a long time, there was no movement from the outside world. Li Hao gently exhaled. "I'm still alright!"At this moment, Sword Saint was also a little nervous. He nodded,""HM, he didn't chase after us. He should be fusing with Sen LAN. This time, it's all thanks to sector Lord Sen Lan's quick reaction, otherwise...Things would have been tough."At the crucial moment, the other party had changed some of his plans.If sector Lord Sen LAN had followed the original plan and continued to resist, Red Moon master might not have suppressed him. Instead, he might have temporarily given up on Sen LAN and turned to Li Hao and the others.That would be the end!"It's worth it to kill so many sixth level venerable sovereigns this time!"Venerable the sword laughed.This time, the three of them had killed many people but they didn't get any benefits. All the benefits went to sector Lord Sen LAN.Previously, he felt that he had suffered a great loss!But now, it was much more balanced. It was not a loss. The other party had played a huge role in the plan to steal Hong Yue's house. The balance was suddenly balanced.On the side, second cat lazily looked at them and then at Li Hao.""It has nothing to do with us, right?" I want to sleep!Second cat was actually very nervous just now. It wasn't that easy to pretend to be a big cat. The aura and form weren't important. The important thing was that if you didn't have the power, it would still be very scary.Li Hao nodded."Senior, you can rest now. Everyone played a key role in this plan. Without you, I wouldn't have the guts to challenge a level 8. Thank you for taking the risk and for your trust!"It was too risky!They had almost been annihilated.Second cat didn't say anything and jumped into the river.The initial stage of the plan had been completed, but the next step was the key. If the Crimson Moon Lord did not leave ... No matter how perfect your plan was, would you dare to go to the Crimson Moon's territory?Even if they left, they could return and descend at any time.On Tian Fang's side, if there wasn't enough temptation and no huge movement, Red Moon master would not leave so easily.If Tian Fang's plan didn't go well ...This time, there were actually only two people who helped him. One was the forest orchid sector Lord, and the other was the red moon sector Lord. No matter how many people Li Hao and the others killed, they were all devoured by the forest orchid sector Lord and returned to the red moon sector.In the end, Hong Yue only lost a few rank six venerable sovereigns, gained a rank seven venerable sovereign, and gained dozens of venerable sovereigns of other levels, which was not a loss at all.It could also stabilize and expand the Dao universe.Once forest world was completely merged, one or two more rank-7s could be born to make up for the previous losses. There was hope for Crimson Moon to quickly recover to its peak.At this time, venerable the sword was still regretful."It's a pity. Neo martial arts is not nearby!"This time, Li Hao had created a huge opportunity. If not for the fact that they were not strong enough, the red moon master and the AI Hong Supreme Emperor would have been able to destroy the enemy's territory.He still felt a little regretful.Li Hao smiled and glanced at venerable the sword. He had no regrets.To put it bluntly, if Red Moon was really destroyed by neo martial artists, where would the Silvermoon people go to plunder resources?There were too many powerhouses in the new martial arts world. If a revered sword artist would need countless resources, would Silver Moon still have a chance then?This time, it would be good if neo martial wasn't here.Of course, Li Hao wouldn't say that. He nodded and said,""It's a little regretful!"He didn't say more about this and quickly said,""Then, everyone, please stay nearby. I'm going back to tianfang ..." Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "I'll go with you!"Kong Ji said,"I might need to talk to my father. My identity should have been exposed. Now, the Lord of the Crimson Moon will most likely see the light as an imaginary enemy. My father doesn't know yet, so I have to tell him in advance."This was still necessary.

2965 Chapter 487
Li Hao nodded.Venerable the sword also wanted to go, but Li Hao said before he could,""Uncle li is too powerful and eye-catching. It's best not to leave. Try to hide nearby and use it as a coordinate. When I really lure the red moon Lord away, I might teleport over quickly.""So, uncle li has another mission, set a time! Lock onto a location near the Crimson Moon world so that we can quickly descend and attack the Crimson Moon!"Venerable the sword nodded his head.This was not a simple job.He had to find a suitable location near the Crimson Moon world, avoid the coverage and observation of the Crimson Moon world, and dig a hole in the chaos."One more thing," Li Hao said."The three worlds near the Crimson Moon!"Li Hao looked solemn."The venerable sovereigns of the three worlds are ready to make a move. Red Moon Lord should have noticed that. They'll definitely make a move next. We can either deepen the Alliance, attack them, or drive them away!""It's best to drive them away. What I'm afraid of is that the Alliance will deepen. Uncle li will have to pay attention to it.""That's true. There are still four level 7 experts in the three worlds!"Sword Saint nodded solemnly. It's very close to the Crimson Moon, so we still have to pay attention to it. "This time, the red moon master was very worried. He was worried that these people would really be bold enough to attack the red moon world.If he didn't remove the threat from the three worlds, no matter how tempting Tian Fang was, he might not leave.At the same time, venerable the sword was worried about something else."You all will need some time to go to Tian Fang. Sen LAN will merge, during the mechation...Will there be any changes in his attitude? Hong Yue's Dao is the Dao of desire. When the other party fuses with the red moon, he must go through all of this and be baptized. He'll be easily affected. "Li Hao shook his head."It's hard to say. But this time, the other party has gained our trust." Just from today's actions, acting against a type 8, it's enough for us to give sector Lord Sen LAN a certain amount of trust. "An appropriate amount of trust was necessary, and he could not doubt anything.Just based on what had happened today, Li Hao was willing to believe that the other party wouldn't be affected.Friends were all made.How could he make friends without any trust?It was impossible for everyone in the chaos to be enemies or friends. The chaos was huge, and it was impossible not to make friends. Without the help of his friend, Kong Ji, Li Hao wouldn't have the ability to scheme against a level 8 world.At the same time, sector Lord Sen Lan's response this time made Li Hao feel that it was still good to make friends at an appropriate time.It wasn't just these people. In tianfang world, Wushan, who came from the cloud world and wanted to leave the clouds, could also make friends.Li Hao felt that it was useful to make more reliable friends when traveling.Neo martial artists did not seem to like making friends in the chaos. That was because neo martial artists had the confidence, but Silver Moon did not. If he wanted to establish himself in the chaos, he would naturally need to have more friends and fewer enemies. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  He didn't say anything more and didn't want to waste time.This plan was only halfway through. Whether or not they could reap the greatest benefits would depend on what happened next. If the plan went smoothly, then it would be time to reap the rewards. But now ... There was really no reward. Not only did he not gain anything, but he had also spent all his money.Whether it was him, Kong Ji, or revered sword artist ... They were all poor now. If there was the origin of light, Kong Ji would not have eaten that little flower."There's no time to waste! Brother kongji, let's set off immediately!"Li Hao turned his head to look at the others."You guys will follow senior venerable the sword. Be careful. Listen to his instructions!""Uncle Li, I'll leave these people to you!" He turned to look at venerable the sword.Venerable the sword was a little helpless and nodded.He didn't really want to bring them along.Although there were many of them, they weren't very strong, and it was inconvenient to bring them with him. He preferred to bring people like Li Hao, who could unleash powerful combat strength at critical moments. They were smart enough to bring great surprises.Unfortunately...In the primordial chaos, there were very few such people.In fact, Qian Wuliang and the others weren't weak. They were all third level venerable sovereigns and Masters of great DAOs. In the eyes of itinerant cultivators, they were top existences.Li Hao didn't say anything more and walked out of the cave with Kong Ji. The two of them quickly left after checking their surroundings.……In the chaos.Kong Ji turned his head and glanced in the direction they had come from. He sent mentally,"Neo martial and Crimson Moon are great enemies. To be honest, it's not impossible for venerable sword to contact Neo martial. If he can contact Neo martial, he may not only plunder but also have great hope to cooperate with our plan and destroy Crimson moon's nest in one fell swoop!"He wanted to ask why Li Hao didn't mention this.Did he not expect it, or ... Did he not mention it on purpose?The sword Saint had expressed his regret earlier as a reminder.However, Li Hao didn't respond to that."Then what can we get?"Li Hao asked in return.Kong Ji was slightly stunned.Li Hao continued,"brother Kongtong, Crimson Moon is now my greatest enemy. Of course ... She's yours now!" We're only at tier four or tier six. I'm willing to be closer to neo martial, but we're still independent individuals after all!""Now, in the chaos, the Crimson Moon is a huge Foundation for us to become stronger ... We'll exploit the Crimson Moon bit by bit and cut it up. This big piece of meat is enough for us to eat for a long time!"

"But if we're really killed by the neo martial artists, will we still have a chance? In fact, the most important point is that ... Red Moon is no longer a match for neo martial arts!"Li Hao explained again,"if the Crimson Moon can still pose a death threat to neo martial, of course, neo martial will be the first to be called and annihilated!" However, she killed three seventh level venerable sovereigns at once, causing Hong Yue's strength to be greatly reduced ... She has changed from taking the initiative to invade to mainly defending. At this time, why should we let neo martial deal with her?"Kong Ji was silent for a while before saying,""But neither you nor I have the ability to deal with an eighth-rank, not to mention an eighth-rank, even a seventh-rank wouldn't work!"We can't take Hong Yue down in one go."No rush!"Li Hao smiled."What's the hurry? as long as I can get a big bite of meat this time, it won't be difficult for me to reach level five, and I even have a chance to reach level six. Brother kongji, let alone Level Seven, it won't be difficult for me to reach the peak of level six! As for the other venerable sovereigns and two Dao Masters, they all have a chance of reaching the intermediate level. A master of a great Dao at the intermediate level is not too weak ..."At that time, there would naturally be a chance."There's one more thing, Dao chess!"Dao chess?Li Hao glanced at Kong Ji and said,""This time, when we return to Tian Fang, we can find a Dao chess game and see if we can go in and comprehend the Dao again. This time, I believe that you and I are different from before! Dao chess itself is an eighth-tier great universe ... Brother kongji, don't you not have a Dao universe?"Kong Ji was stunned and speechless for a long time!What did that mean?He was a little ... Shaken.A tier 8 great cosmos!Li Hao continued,"you might want to open your own Dao universe, but even if you do, without enough energy, where are you going to open it?" Your light is powerful, but would your father be able to pour all of the resources of the divine light plane into you? He may agree, but the other venerable sovereigns in the divine light realm will not!""The red moon's macro world may not be enough for us to eat. As for the Dao chess ... If we can get their support, we will have an eighth-tier great path universe. By then, it will be enough for you, me, venerable the sword, and the others to eat their fill!""And for the three of us, to reach the 7th grade, we might have to create a huge commotion. I feel that it definitely won't be as huge as sector Lord Sen LAN 's. It won't just take that much energy to kill a few 6th grade experts?""Without the devouring of a great Dao universe, can we level up?"Kong Ji nodded."Your family is very rich, but can you ask your father to give you a Dao universe?"Of course not.If there really was a universe of the great path, the world of light would have swallowed it by itself.There was a lot of chaos in the seventh-tier great Dao universe.He couldn't be like neo martial, killing whoever he encountered, right?In fact, neo martial didn't really dare to kill everywhere. The people they killed were all Red moon's allies. The neo martial human King was so arrogant. When he went to the tianfang region, he couldn't kill at will. At least, he had to have a good reason. For example, if the other party provoked him first, otherwise, he would be besieged by all parties.At this time, Kong Ji thought about it carefully ... So, I'm not that rich.For those below the seventh step, the divine light plane would bear all the resources.His father would also give it to him.However, if he really wanted to reach Level Seven, it would be too difficult to inherit the family business if his father did not die. He couldn't curse his father to die quickly, right?In the past, he really thought that he was rich, but after hearing Li Hao's words, he realized that ... He was just so-so!It was just so-so! no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  It wasn't as good as the top, but it was better than the bottom. The level of petty bourgeoisie.Once upon a time, even the Crown Prince of a rank 8 world felt that he was poor."Then ... Then I made an agreement with the sword Saint that I only want 20%, isn't that too little? Why don't ... I go back and tell him to give me 30%?"He suddenly felt that he had been too generous before.Three, three, four would be better.Li Hao laughed."It doesn't matter. As for venerable the sword, we'll have to work with him until he reaches the seventh stage or has enough resources for the seventh stage. Then, we'll part ways. He'll go back to his new martial arts, and we'll walk our own path."Li Hao wouldn't hang out with a seventh rank venerable sword anymore.Kong Ji was startled.To be honest, what everyone wanted was for the people around them to become stronger. However, Li Hao's intention was that when revered sword reached the seventh rank, he would not follow them even if he was willing to.Li Hao hoped that he could play a decisive role in the team.However, once the sword Saint reached the seventh level, the peak of the seventh level, then ... Their role would be infinitely reduced. They would become subordinates and not partners."In other words, even if you meet the neo martial human King on this trip to Tian Fang ... You won't act with him?""Yes."Li Hao nodded."They might not think highly of me. I'm too weak." At the same time, I don't want to be anyone's burden. You and I were able to help venerable the sword, and he needs us too. Once he's strong enough that he doesn't need us anymore, what's the point of us following?"Kong Ji sighed and nodded."I actually thought the same. Otherwise ..."I can also follow my father.It was good to be independent.I've thought about this for 500 years, but Li Hao seems to have figured it out in just a few days. As expected of my lonely friend.Some people couldn't figure it out their entire lives.……The Skylands world.It had been a lot quieter recently.Ever since Wu Shan and the others had killed the two red Moon sovereign, tianfang world was no longer sealed off. Many venerable sovereigns had entered tianfang world. However, after a round of searching, they were puzzled.

2967 Chapter 487
The universe of the great path that had appeared before seemed to have disappeared completely.Without the great Dao universe as a catalyst, there would naturally be less chaos.Now, everyone was searching, but they couldn't find anything even after searching the entire Tian Fang.On the other hand, there was some information from Red Moon.Sector Lord Senlan had entered the seventh step and merged with Red Moon. The neo martial Swordmaster and silver Moon King had ambushed Red Moon and killed several sixth step experts ... To the Lords of the major worlds, Red Moon had not lost anything. Instead, she had gained something.A few sixth-tier universe died in exchange for a seventh-tier universe. What a great bargain!This time, everyone was a little envious.Although the other party's losses were not small previously, this time, they had indeed made a huge profit. There was nothing to pity about. Instead, they should pity the neo martial Swordmaster and the others. They had helped the Senlan realm Lord by killing some sixth stage venerable sovereigns. In the end, the Senlan realm Lord had seized the harvest.In this way, Red Moon had lost three rank seven venerable sovereigns previously, but one of them had instantly recovered. Moreover, once Sen LAN completely integrated with it, the world could be stabilized again, and one or two more rank seven venerable sovereigns would probably be born ... At that time, Red Moon would have completely recovered. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  ……Back to the Dragon Temple.At this moment, Wu Shan was still waiting here.There was a seventh level venerable sovereign nearby, who was also from Yunxiao. Ever since Wushan expressed his intention to leave, the Lord of the cloud sky had not officially arrived. Instead, he had sent another seventh level venerable sovereign to tianfang to represent Yunxiao.The seventh rank venerable sovereign laughed.""Wu Shan, this Senlan sector Lord is quite tactful. I heard that the red moon master appeared, and he quickly chose to open up his great Dao universe and merge with the red moon. The temptation of a level 8 world is still huge, even a level 7 world Lord is taking the initiative to merge with it. Now that the chaos is shaking, level 8 is the foundation. Level 7...Is still a bit weak!"Even though he said he was the Senlan sector Lord, there was a deeper meaning to it.Did you see that?So what if he was a Type 7 world Lord?When he encountered a level eight, he still compromised and became a grandson, still took the initiative to integrate, still did not dare to resist.Countless people wanted to integrate into the family, but some people wanted to leave!Sovereign Wushan was a top existence even in the cloud world. He was the second most powerful person after the realm Lord. Before he came, the realm Lord had mentioned something about him, which the rank 7 expert couldn't understand.Yes, everyone wanted to leave. This was actually not wrong!However, it all depended on the timing.During peaceful times, that would not be a problem.But now, the chaos was in turmoil, and high-rank venerable sovereigns were falling like rain. In a short time, many seventh-rank venerable sovereigns had died. If they still wanted to leave now, it would make both sides unhappy.Cloudsky would lose a peak tier 7 expert.And you, Wu Shan, have left the clouds. Where are you going?Would he become Yunxiao's enemy?Would they join other macro worlds?These were all unknown factors!Look, now, the Senlan sector Lord has become a level 7 and is also the master of a Dao universe. Didn't he also enter a level 8 universe? Wu Shan drank a cup of tea, his face calm. On the ground, venerable Emperor Hui long and the others pretended not to hear him and didn't dare to make a sound.There were two stage seven experts from the cloud world keeping watch here, and Wu Shan was a peak stage seven expert who had killed a ruthless stage seven expert before ... Hui long didn't dare to make a sound.Wu Shan finished his tea and glanced at the other. He calmly said,""Deep sea, everyone has their own ambitions! Do you think that my sacrifice for Yunxiao all these years is enough to exchange for freedom?"The deep sea venerable sovereign was speechless.Is that enough?He thought it was enough, but ... It was different. You were a peak level Seven. If you left, the realm Lord would be worried and the cloud realm would suffer a great loss.For a moment, it was not good to continue the conversation.Free body ...Was he not free now?Of course, with a realm Lord here, we won't have the freedom we imagined. However, in the eyes of others, we are still high and mighty, invincible existences. For example, this Hui long, a sixth stage venerable sovereign, but in front of us, isn't he just like a grandson?He was the leader of one of the four regions in the sky, the leader of the southern region. Freedom ... My ass!You, Wu Shan, even if you leave, can you be better than him?He didn't continue talking about this and said,"you've seen the appearance of the Dao universe before ... Wushan, the Dao universe has disappeared without a trace recently. It disappeared! Do you think it's about to recover, or ... It's just a flash in the pan and won't recover at all?""Sooner or later,"Nonsense!I also know that it will happen sooner or later, but sooner or later, how many years will it take?A million years?He couldn't stay here forever. It was a waste of time.He had no choice but to ask,"by the way, the Son of God of light, Ming Tang, has been cultivating here all this time. But there has been no news of him recently. Has he left?"The news spread from the red moon.However, there was no mention of emptiness.Red Moon blocked the news.Even if they knew Kong Ji's identity, they had to pretend that they didn't know. Otherwise, once the news got out, even if the divine light plane might not have been against them in the first place, they would really be against them if it got out!The red moon Lord had suppressed this information. Most of the people who knew about the situation had died. Those who hadn't died had been integrated into the red moon, so it was naturally difficult to spread.The deep sea Thearch was a little curious. Was that guy not here anymore?As for the dark Demon Ridge, it was still guarded by the Supreme Emperor Hui long. According to the Supreme Emperor Hui Long's information, Kong Ji didn't seem to be in the dark Demon Ridge anymore. No one knew where he went."I'm not too sure. "Wu Shan was drinking his tea. He knew that the Silver Moon King was in the red moon, and so was the sword Saint, so naturally, Kong Ji was there as well. Perhaps it was these three who had worked together to kill Xing Shen. Not long after they had been teleported out, news of Xing Shen's death had come.

2968 Chapter 487
This time, the three of them had caused a big commotion in Senlan, but neo Martial Emperor Cang and the others had not made any movements ... This meant that everything was caused by these three and had little to do with neo martial.New martial might not be in the red moon region anymore.Where did he go?Who knows?Perhaps, he would come to Tian Fang."If there's still no news from the great Dao universe ... We can't stay here forever. Wushan, let's go back together if there's still no movement after a while.""Let's talk about it again. "Wushan was not in a hurry. He did not want to go back.Deepsea's words were clearly not just his. Perhaps ... It was also the cloud Lord's intention.The deep sea venerable sovereign frowned slightly.If he didn't go back, it meant that he was determined to leave.It was really ... Troublesome!Wushan, do you even understand the sector Lord's meaning?A peak rank seven venerable sovereign, how about you give up your power completely? otherwise, if you want to take away a rank seven power, how could the realm Lord agree?As for killing Hong Yu, Wu Shan didn't hand over the power of his great Dao because he felt it wasn't enough. It would be useless even if he handed it over. He kept it for now, and when he had enough energy to redeem himself, he would hand it over ... Hoping to get the realm Lord's approval.The deep sea Thearch also had a headache. As a member of the cloud world, Wu Shan actually had quite a good relationship with people in the cloud world.The cloud world had four level Seven venerable sovereigns.Everyone's relationship with this person was still okay, but...Wu Shan wasn't a sector Lord.He was now very worried that if Wu Shan really made up his mind to leave, they might end up turning against each other and have internal strife. At that time, it would really become a joke.Seeing that he didn't say anything more, Wu Shan also ignored him. He was thinking about something.This time, the Crimson Moon's side could roughly confirm that neo martial's territory was not near the Crimson Moon. Otherwise, this was a rare opportunity. The other party would definitely make a move. In the end, they did not. Then, the Crimson Moon's biggest threat would be gone for the moment.The neo martial human King wasn't there either. Recently, there were people near Tian Fang who saw that person and wandered around. He didn't know what they were up to.On the Crimson Moon's side, after annexing Senlan and stabilizing the world, with two rank Sevens guarding the land ... Would the Lord of the Crimson Moon come to tianfang?Of course, he needed some time to stabilize the world.Also, the Silver Moon King and Kong Ji seemed to have suffered a loss this time, not getting any benefits at all...Helping the forest orchid sector Lord and the Crimson Moon world, what were these people planning?From what he understood, both solitary and the Silvermoon King had communicated with each other before. They were extremely daring, but they hadn't gotten anything out of it this time. Were they just going to let it go?Or should he continue to look for opportunities near the Crimson Moon? Or ... Did he have other plans?When will the Silver Moon King come to tianfang and open the Dao universe for me?I've already fulfilled my promise to him.He also expressed his determination to leave the cloud world. He didn't have to say it. However, he still did. On one hand, he wanted the cloud world to be prepared. After all, that was his hometown. He didn't want his sudden departure to cause chaos in the cloud world. The cloud world Lord was unprepared and might be ambushed.Although they might fall out in the future, it would be a sin if the other party was plotted against and the sky was destroyed because of their separation.Thus, Wu Shan took the initiative to bring it up.On the other hand, it's also to show my determination. I've cut off all means of retreat, I have to leave! no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  If he didn't leave, wouldn't he lose face?In the future, he would become a laughingstock!Right now, he could only think about when the Silver Moon King would open the Tian Fang Dao. Whether he succeeded or not, he had to give it a try!As he was thinking, the Dragon Emperor said carefully,""My Lords, recently, some powerhouses have been colluding with the major forces in tianfang, hoping that they can open up the Taoist connotation and do some experiments ...""What?"Wushan was still unclear of the situation, but Deepsea seemed to have already known. She said,""Some people think that the appearance of the tianfang great path universe might be related to the destruction of the Taoist connotation. The tianfang universe appeared after the Taoist connotation of the water and fire paths were destroyed.""Now, some people hope to try and continue to destroy the Taoist connotation. Isn't the dark Demon Ridge the cultivation place of the secret emissary in the past?""What they mean is ... We should try to destroy them one by one and see if we can trigger the tianfang great Dao universe to appear again." Deepsea chuckled.This was something that had been mentioned before.However, the Taoist connotation was the key to Tian Fang's ability to attract so many venerable sovereigns. Once the Taoist connotation was destroyed, Tian Fang would become an empty shell. Previously, a large number of independent venerable sovereigns had not agreed to this!After all, the level-nine great path universe had nothing to do with them.But now, things were different. Yunxiao, Guangming, and the others all agreed. With the appearance of these great worlds, what were you, an itinerant cultivator,?Don't agree?Do you dare?These Taoist connotation was not very useful to the macro world. So what if it was an eighth-level Taoist connotation? their realm Lord was an eighth-level realm Lord, and he was still alive. The place where they cultivated was even more Taoist connotation than the Taoist connotation!Since that was the case, he might as well try to destroy it.Wu Shan frowned.In fact, he didn't care, but he knew that the dark Demon Ridge was different. Here ... There might be a chess piece. It wasn't a possibility, but a must. Otherwise, it couldn't have been teleported away before the void.Once the dark Demon Ridge was completely opened, or even destroyed, the chess pieces would appear ... At that time, would the Silver Moon King and the others still return?

Dao chess was now the bait for them."The dark Devil Ridge is temporarily closed to the public!" He said with a slight frown."Why?"Deepsea was confused. Why?Everyone has agreed, but you don 't?"It's not that we won't open it, but we can't open it in the first batch. Let's wait for the last!" These guys wanted to destroy the Taoist connotation, cut off the hope of itinerant cultivators, and cut off the roots of some macro worlds. The Taoist connotation was the key to attract itinerant cultivators and also the key to cultivate peripheral forces! If you want to destroy it, you can start from other places!"The venerable Dragon Emperor was a little embarrassed. He didn't want to, but he still said,""They ... They said that in the tianfang southern region, the Dao accumulation land has the closest connection with the great Dao universe. The previous two times, the Dao accumulation land in the southern region was destroyed, and the great Dao universe appeared. On the southern region, the most powerful Dao accumulation land known to be is the dark Demon Ridge, so they hope ... To Start from the Dark Demon Ridge.""Who are they?"Wushan looked at him and replied to the Dragon Emperor, even more nervous.""It's ... It's some major cosmos absolute beings, including ... The world of light!"He didn't say anything. In fact, cloudsky had also agreed.They had only informed Wushan and didn't think he would care. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  In the end, Wu Shan really did care.To hell with it!This was just a small matter. Hui long didn't care, and neither did the cloud Master. It was best if they could find the great Dao universe. What did they care about?Or ... Had he guessed it right?Could it be that you, Wu Shan, knew what was going on, so you didn't leave and stayed here just for this?It was not impossible!Some people had actually guessed this because Wu Shan was the first to enter tianfang world. He was the first rank seven venerable sovereign to arrive after the great path universe appeared. He had even sealed tianfang world before.Some people also guessed that Wu Shan might know something.If it wasn't for Wu Shan's strength and the fact that he had killed a seventh-rank, someone would have come to question him.The deep sea Thearch also looked at him thoughtfully. Could it be that ... He had guessed it right?The universe of the great path could really emerge after destroying the Taoist connotation of the southern realm, and the dark Demon Ridge could do it. Was that why Wushan didn't leave but stayed in the Hui long temple with an unhurried attitude?Strange!As for Wu Shan, he was somewhat helpless.The major cosmos absolute beings were not fools. In fact, they had guessed wrong, but they had hit the right spot. The destruction of the dark Demon Ridge would reveal many things, including the level nine pressure that day!Therefore, he could not allow anyone to destroy him.How troublesome!The tianfang universe was related to these Dao reserve lands, but it wasn't a big deal. The key was the Silver Moon King. Of course, he might also need to borrow the power of these Dao reserve lands."Just say that I don't agree. Let's try the other places first!""But ..." The deep sea venerable sovereign furrowed his brows."No buts!" Wu Shan frowned. Are you and Huilong going to force me to agree?"“……” Deep sea was speechless.However, he was even more certain that there might be a connection.It seemed that Wushan and the cloud world were going to be separated.He felt a little regretful. He stood up and nodded."Then let's try other places. If it still doesn't work ... Wushan, at that time, the dark Demon Ridge will definitely be destroyed. This is not something a tier 7 can stop! Now, the radiant master and many other major cosmos absolute beings, including those from the Dragon field and the Scarlet sun field, have sent their forces here. Although cloudy heavens is strong, he can't stop all of them!"Block? Wu Shan smiled and didn't say anything. Cloudsky was probably also impatient.How could he block it?This is so troublesome!He didn't say anything more, but the deep sea venerable sovereign said,"Then we'll take our leave. Wushan, do you want to come with us?""No need!"“……”Wu Shan's refusal made Deepsea even more certain that this method was useless.He really knew the inside story!He didn't even try to hide anything.He didn't say anything more and walked away. The venerable Emperor of the Hui long sect took a careful look at the mist Mountain. Soon, he left with the venerable Emperor of the Hui long temple. The Hui long temple was against the clouds, not the mist Mountain.However, he couldn't afford to offend this person.At this moment, there was only Wu Shan ... No, there was a servant serving Wu Shan, pouring him tea and wine.Wu Shan was drinking tea, but he didn't drink any wine.After a while, he glanced at the servant beside him.""When do you think those people will return?"“……”The servant's face was filled with nervousness. Wu Shan calmly said,"What, you can't guess?""No... No, my Lord, I ...""Giant pincer, don't you understand them?"The giant pincer was extremely nervous. How could it understand?Ever since Li Hao's group had left, the giant pincer had wanted to leave Tian Fang, but ... He had been called over by Wu Shan to become his servant. The giant pincer had been very nervous, but it had vaguely known that the lonely deity and the Silver Moon King might have some connection with the Wushan Thearch.More importantly, this was a seventh rank venerable sovereign!He was afraid!"Right now, all parties are speculating that the dark Devil Ridge will soon become the key. At most, it'll take a month. If they don't return by then ... I can't make an enemy out of all parties for the sake of the dark Devil Ridge!"Wu Shan stood up and sighed,"it's difficult to cultivate the Dao, but it's even more difficult to cultivate the Dao of freedom!" Giant pincer, cultivating the Dao of chaos is good. Although it's a little messy, it gives you more freedom, although it's more dangerous, and there are fewer opportunities ... Of course, each has its own advantages and disadvantages!"The seventh level venerable sovereign laughed,""At my level, I'm a little dissatisfied. Human desires are terrible. Red moon's Dao is the Dao of desire. Red Moon sovereign had to provoke new martial arts because of his strong desire. Otherwise, he wouldn't have ended up like this! "People like me can always be high and mighty in the clouds. However, my desire is also very great. I want to obtain more ... Perhaps, my death is coming!"
