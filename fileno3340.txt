Wushan was speechless. He didn't even have a Dao universe.He knew quite a few great DAOs, but ... None of them were too strong.So, I have no hope of reaching the ninth step?Well, actually, he didn't have much hope.In fact, Li Hao often talked about the ninth-rank. If it weren't for these people, his greatest wish in the early years would have been to break away from the clouds and become an eighth-rank, which he had already achieved.In the millions of years of chaos, only one tier 9 had been born. Did they really think that everyone had a chance of reaching tier 9?At this moment, Wu Shan didn't think too much about it. He exhaled. "I'm already very satisfied with the eighth rank. However, you're right. If I can fight for it, I'll naturally fight for it!"However, if there was no other way, it was too difficult ... If it was not that material, then he would just give up. There was nothing bad about eighth-grade.Li Hao smiled. That's right. There was no need to force certain things.Did these powerhouses of the eighth step not understand?Did he not know what a Dao domain was?He didn't know how to construct it?Knowing was knowing, but what could they do?Everyone knew that robbing an eighth-tier universe would make them stronger, but ... How many people would actually succeed?As he was thinking, Kong Ji said,"alright, let's talk about a thousand DAOs. Even if you succeed in comprehending Dao, the power of great DAOs is still extremely scarce ... You should have more than 1000 realm openings now, right? but 1000 realm openings ... How much power of great DAOs have you eaten? The way I see it, even if I really walk the path of Dao domain, I can't copy you. You created the Dao laws like a world ... Haoyue, if you do it this way and give you the entire square domain, will you be able to reach the seventh step?"Li Hao laughed."Level 7. Actually, it's fine if I successfully construct my Dao domain. I think I'm no different from Level 7 now ... At this level, I can't simply use level 6 or Level 7 to distinguish myself ..."Was he considered a seventh-rank?The biggest difference between level six and Level Seven was the strength of Dao domain and Dao laws. In fact, none of Li Hao's Dao of the thousand worlds had reached Level Seven, so he was still level six in the eyes of outsiders.Yuan Shuo was the same. He had just entered rank four, and his strongest Dao was only at rank four ...However, strictly speaking, the Dao domains they had constructed could be considered rank seven. However, none of your great path nomological laws had reached rank seven.This was the realm in everyone's eyes!In Li Hao's eyes, a Dao domain or a great Dao that had reached the damage of a level Seven Dao domain could be considered Level Seven. He felt that he should be at the seventh rank. He was a true seventh rank venerable sovereign, not the sixth rank that everyone thought he was.Li Hao's strongest Dao was only at the sixth step. This was why everyone thought that he was only at the sixth step even though he was more powerful than an Ordinary Level Seven after merging a thousand worlds.Li Hao added,"but you're right. My Dao alone is not strong enough. The time Dao at the core is only at level six because it was left by Zhan Tiandi!"Hence, to truly enter Grade 7, it wasn't about accumulating more realms, but one of the great DAOs that had to enter Grade 7.Otherwise, even if Li Hao could kill a level nine venerable sovereign in the infinite worlds, he would still be a level six venerable sovereign in everyone's eyes.However, Li Hao quickly added,"don't worry. I'm reaching Level Seven soon. Actually, it's not of much use. It'll only make the enemy more vigilant!" The destruction Sword Dao that I've recently gathered seems to be catching up ... After I sort it out, my calamity sword Dao might be the first to reach the seventh rank!"Looking at the Thunder region in front of him, he sighed with emotion,""This place is the most suitable for me to cultivate the catastrophe sword principle! It's hard to perfect all the great DAOs, but it's easy to perfect the catastrophe sword Dao. I might be able to step into the seventh rank here ..."At that time, he would be stronger, but there would not be too much of a qualitative change.At present, if he really wanted to undergo a qualitative change, he had to continue opening realms. The power of a thousand realms could only be said to be that he had just gained a firm foothold in the seventh-rank. To become invincible in the seventh-rank and reach the level of a human King, he would need to open at least three thousand realms. Li Hao felt that even two thousand realms would be difficult.Of course, at that level...They might be on par with Wu Shan and the others, comparable to ordinary eighth-ranked powerhouses. Best novel online free at ‚ďĚ0‚ď•‚ďĒ‚ďõ‚ďĎ‚ďė‚ďĚ At least 3000 Jie!To reach the level of the Dragon Lord, it might take four to five thousand worlds. The gap was still very large. According to them, the Dragon Lord could kill a tier 8 with two to three punches. If the other party had constructed a Dao domain, he would have at least five to six thousand Dao domains.At Li Hao's level, it was no longer a simple matter of realm.He weighed the situation again. According to the normal Dao laws, people like red Moon Emperor only had 4000 Dao laws.If the light Thearch was in charge of the local great world, he would only have the strength of 5000 Dao laws at most.As for human Kings, there should be around 4000 to 5000 of them. If they officially entered level 8, it might reach 5000 to 6000?Who knows?However, he was definitely still a little weaker than the Dragon Lord.For now, Li Hao's power of one Dao was at least double that of others. After all, he had consumed a large amount of great DAOs and turned them into realms. In fact, he should be stronger, but the quality of his realm Dao was not high.Most of the seventh level venerable sovereigns had the strength of two to three thousand traces. Only the top seventh level venerable sovereigns like the human King had transcended and were comparable to eighth level existences.With such a division, Li Hao had a clearer understanding of everyone's strength.As for the lightning Master and Wu Shan, they currently only had three to four thousand of them. Even if they were level eight, they were only at the bottom of level eight.

Chapter 3341 The Difference In Strength (3)
In fact, venerable the sword also had many Dao laws. However, he had just advanced not long ago, and the quality was slightly worse. Therefore, he was slightly weaker and might not be as good as Li Hao, who had eaten too much world power.As for Kong Ji, although he had just reached tier 7, he had a six-path three-pole Dao domain. His Dao domain was powerful and he had at least 2000 Dao force. He was considered very strong.As for the weaker rank seven venerable sovereigns with the power of a thousand DAOs, they were very weak. The weaker ones were not even rank seven venerable sovereigns.p ……Li Hao explained his judgment to everyone.The others didn't think much of it. Whether it was Level Seven or Dao power calculation, for them, it didn't make much of a difference what strength they should have.The blood Emperor nodded and said,""Your method of division is actually more precise! Now, level six, Level Seven, level eight ... These were all very general terms. They were just a general term for a large realm, and the gap between them was still very big! However, according to what you said, you've set the strength of the power of Dao law as that of a first level venerable sovereign, right?"Li Hao nodded."Then, according to your division, the seventh rank venerable sovereign has the power of a thousand DAOs," the blood Emperor said."It's at least a thousand times more concentrated than the first rank venerable sovereign ... Is it really that high?"It can't be that high, right?He had also entered the seventh step, so he was still very clear about it. It was not that exaggerated.Even though a seventh rank venerable sovereign could easily kill a hundred first rank venerable sovereigns, he still felt that it was impossible to achieve an energy concentration that was a thousand times stronger than that.Li Hao explained,"an ordinary small realm can accommodate one first level venerable sovereign. My current thousand realms can actually accommodate 1000 first level venerable sovereigns. Of course, I'm special. As for the other seventh level venerable sovereigns, I'll take half of them. I think one seventh level venerable sovereign is equivalent to 500 first level venerable sovereigns."This was more like it!The blood Emperor nodded and said,""Can your power of a thousand worlds be comparable to a venerable sovereign?""In terms of pure energy ... It's almost there!"The blood Emperor thought of Supremes, Supremes, and the thousand emperors as one. Did that mean that he was actually on par with Li Hao?No!He suddenly thought of something. Almost every Supreme's thousand clones had some independent self-control consciousness. In fact, they were more difficult to deal with than Li Hao's thousand worlds. Therefore, they should be more powerful!Therefore, old Zhang should be much stronger than Li Hao.He sighed at the thought of this. Old Zhang had devoured a lot of great DAOs over the years. Li Hao had devoured so many worlds to create his own Qianjie, but old Zhang had embezzled so much without saying a word.He didn't say anything else. Seeing that Li Hao had a direction and a goal, and there were even two level eight venerable sovereigns on his side, he didn't say anything more. He looked at second cat and said,""Second cat, since you want to stay ... I won't take you back to new martial. Big cat said he misses you very much and can go back to see you when he's free. As for me ... I have to leave. There are still some things to deal with at new martial ..."He wasn't going to travel with Li Hao's group. He wasn't familiar with them, and they didn't need his help. In that case, he might as well leave."Senior, are you leaving?"Li Hao was a little surprised, but not too surprised. The Masters of new martial arts were used to farewells. They came and went in a hurry and rarely stayed in one place for long.He was quite free and easy!"I'm leaving. What about you guys? Are you going to stay in the lightning territory, return to the square territory, or leave?"Li Hao pondered for a moment."I'll stay in the Thunder region for a while. There's a high chance that I won't return for now. The Dragon Lord is here." I've killed so many of his men. It's fine if he doesn't see me, but he might not hunt me down. If he sees me ... Whether it's to give an explanation to his subordinates or something else, he'll still attack me. " Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ At the moment, it was very difficult for him to return to the four-sided domain.As for when tianfang world would recover, it should take some time. The Dao stars that had been separated last time might have been taken away by others or returned to tianfang universe because many venerable sovereigns had died this time.Anyway, it wouldn't be so fast to cultivate it to the point where it could be opened. Besides, those venerable sovereigns probably didn't have the mood to cultivate it now.Tianfang universe had opened twice, but both times had been fake.Now, those seventh rank venerable sovereigns were probably about to give up. Their repeated resurrections were all fake. The next time they really resurrected, they might treat it as a fake and would definitely not run in so easily again."If you go to the outer area ... Be careful. It's said that there's a rank nine in the outer area, but our information is not very clear. If we encounter a rank eight venerable sovereign, it's fine with Wu Shan and the others around, but if we encounter a rank nine venerable sovereign ... Even if it's the weakest rank nine, I'm afraid we can't match it."Li Hao nodded. This was true.According to his thoughts, a grade-9 existence would have at least 9000 Dao laws.If he didn't gather 6000 Jie, he wouldn't be able to match a true level nine venerable sovereign.But now, he had put in so much effort and only managed to gather a thousand worlds. If he wanted to fight a grade-9 ... He should just go to sleep.Even a Dragon Master with the power of 6000 Dao laws would be helpless against a grade-9 expert. The difference was still huge.The blood Emperor did not say anything more. He turned around and left quickly.

Chapter 3342 The Difference In Strength (6)
They came quickly and left quickly.It was as if he had really come here just to see second cat and Li Hao.Second cat watched him leave and muttered,""He's actually quite similar to a teacher. " Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ "He is him. Don't always associate him with teaching."Li Hao laughed."Everyone wants to live as themselves. They don't want to live as a second person. Take you for example. Everyone says that you are Emperor Cang, but you're not happy, right?"Second cat thought for a moment and nodded in agreement with Li Hao.That's right!"Then I won't say it next time ..."It mumbled and decided not to say it again.She then looked at Li Hao ... Actually, you look a little like him, but just as Li Hao said, everyone is willing to live their own lives, so why bother? I don't want to be treated like a big cat either."Everyone, I've finished the general enlightenment. Next, I'll take the black Panther and continue to walk in the lightning territory for a while to see the various lightning pillars. I'll carefully comprehend and absorb some power of the lightning territory to see if I can officially improve my calamity sword principle to Level Seven! "As for everyone ... You can cultivate on your own. You can also go to the Thunder World and Exchange ideas with each other. You can also go outside the Thunder region ... I don't recommend returning to the square region!"As for these people, if they really wanted to go back, they could go to the World of light. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous to stay in the Dragon field."Let's go back and talk about the great Dao ..."Wu Shan, on the other hand, did not want to go back. He had entered the eighth step with great difficulty. If he went back now, he might be beaten to death by the Dragon Lord.As for going to new martial, he didn't have such an idea.It would be better to hook up with the Thunderbolt master and communicate with him. Thinking of this, he said,""Oh right, the Senlan world is still in the three regions ... That Senlan guy is actually quite interesting. His world is only a level Seven world. Why don't I trouble you to make a trip and bring Senlan over to reminisce about the past ..."Wu Shan suddenly suggested.He had dealt with sector Lord Sen LAN for a period of time before. Now that the four regions was in chaos, new martial still had to help light and might not have the time to take care of that guy.A tier 7 great world was originally very powerful, but the Dragon Lord was about to go crazy.If they couldn't find Li Hao and didn't dare to deal with neo martial, it would be too easy to beat Sen LAN!With er Mao here, now that it had reached the seventh rank, it could be considered a Chaos Beast. Although it wasn't as fast as Cang Mao, it could still take the seventh rank world and run."The forest world?"Li Hao thought for a moment."It's safer for everyone to stick together ... We can ask him. If the forest orchid sector Lord is willing, then there's no problem. If he's not, then it's fine. The Dragon Lord might not really deal with him. It'll take some time to find him ..." However, if they were willing to come, the Thunder World was a level eight world. In the Thunder territory, it was difficult to survive in a single great world. It was even difficult to survive in the stomach of a Chaos Beast. It would cause the great path universe to be invaded by lightning.However, if they were to enter the Thunder World, they would be able to resist it. This was also the crucial reason why the Dragon Lord wanted to seize the Thunder World.At that time, it would be much more convenient to leave the Thunder region, and he could come and go as he pleased."I'll go look for Sen LAN," said Wu Shan."I'll have to trouble er Mao to come with me. We've exchanged communication methods last time. I should be able to locate his world very quickly ..."He was very enthusiastic, but second cat was a little unhappy. I'm not moving!But ..."Then I'll have to trouble senior second cat to make a trip ..." Li Hao said.Second cat was speechless!He had to work again!This was really troublesome.But Li Hao had already said so. Although he wasn't very willing, he still left with Wu Shan. Kong Ji was a little surprised."Didn't you say last time that it's better for us to separate and work together? we can leave whenever we want. Why did you ask senior Wushan to bring Senlan here?""The four-sided domain is no longer peaceful! Since we're acquaintances, perhaps the outer regions are indeed safer. ""Dragon Lord," Li Hao explained,"it's really not simple. I suspect that he's even planted people in many worlds in the three territories. They might invade the three territories at any time and unify them! New martial won't care about this either, so ... If this goes on, staying in the square region may turn you into the dragon Lord's prisoner or even a captive corpse ...""Is the Dragon Lord really that strong?"Kong Ji still didn't have a clear understanding."My father isn't weak. With neo martial ... He can't be a match for the Dragon Lord, right?""It's hard to say!"Li Hao shook his head and said,"neo martial artists are quite powerful. However, it hasn't been long. It just advanced to level eight!" The human King ..."Li Hao considered for a moment before saying,"I suspect that the human King might not have paid much attention to the development of the neo martial world. He has been busy with his own inner world. His inner world might not be too powerful ... I think that the human King might give up the neo martial world and give it to Emperor Cang or Zhi Zun. If that's the case ... The human King's strength might decline for a short period of time.""What?"Kong Ji was stunned,'why do you say that? The new martial art, yin and yang, is also the core Dao of the human King. Would he give it up so easily?"Li Hao thought for a while and said,""It's hard to say. If it wasn't exposed before, he might have been secretly cultivating. Now that it's exposed, the human King might let himself go completely. He's just this kind of personality. He's very bold. Letting himself go completely might be a relief for him ... He seems to have always wanted to throw neo martial arts to the Supreme martial artist. I think that's really possible. If that's the case ... The Supreme martial artist isn't the kind of person who takes the initiative to attack. He might not take the initiative to go to the war Dragon World, but rather avoid the edge first ..."

Chapter 3343 The Difference In Strength (3)
Li Hao analyzed for a while and said,"in this case, your father will either give up on the bright universe or ... Neo martial will run away at any time. Your father ... Might have to rely on the Dragon Master."Kong Ji opened his mouth and said after a while,"I don't think so. My father ... I've killed so many venerable sovereigns of the Dragon Realm. If my father isn't stupid, he wouldn't do this."Li Hao laughed."It's hard to say. But I think neo martial arts isn't the kind of person who will always stay behind. They will leave sooner or later. If your father doesn't make preparations early, he may be in danger at any time ..."Kong Ji was helpless.If that was the case, light was indeed dangerous. It used to be the absolute Overlord of a rank eight world. Now, once the new martial artists left, it would be broken at any time. It was really miserable.From the looks of it, a level 8 world seemed to be nothing more than this. It was even a burden."Give up ... Then it's better to give it to neo martial!"At this time, Kong Ji said,"if I were my father, I'd just give light to neo martial. It doesn't matter if the human King swallows it or the neo martial swallows it, they'll become stronger. If the human King swallows it, his inner world may advance to the eighth level and become a true independent eighth level sovereign venerable. If a Supreme swallows it, he may take control of neo martial and become a new eighth level sovereign! This way, I'll be doing you a huge favor ..."At that time, he would be on Li Hao's side, and his father and new martial arts would be in an Alliance. How big of a favor would it be to give him a level eight great world?At that time, light might have a better future.But ... Would his father bear to do so?A type 8 world!It really wasn't something that could be let go easily."Why don't you give it to Li Hao?" Dao Qi couldn't help asking.Why are you siding with an outsider? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Kong Ji laughed, and so did Li Hao."For me, an additional level eight world is just adding flowers to a brocade. If I give it to neo martial artists or the human King, it'll be a timely help if the human King's inner world can reach level eight!" He said. Maximizing the benefits is also the most feasible method ..."Dao Qi was still a little unwilling,"then ...""Li Haozhen laughed."Senior daoqi, I'm just saying. I'm not really giving it to you. The light Thearch probably won't be willing to give it to you!" You're taking it seriously?"“……”Dao Qi was speechless. Why not take it seriously?Of course, he had to take it seriously! If he really gave it away ... Wouldn't it be a huge loss for him if he gave it away?Kong Ji was here. After all, he was the Crown Prince of Light. The family was reunited. In addition to the eighth-rank light Emperor and four seventh-rank experts, he felt that the strength of Silver moon's side could even suppress the neo martial artists.For now ... It was probably not possible.The human king and emperor Cang had both reached level eight. Wu Shan and the Thunder Emperor were no match for them, and Li Hao was probably no match for a Supreme-being. Even Kong Ji, Dao Qi, and ermao were probably no match for venerable the sword, sun god, and Lizhu.After some calculations ... Even if Wu Shan had brought Sen LAN, he would probably not be able to match them.Daoqi felt that if he wanted to be the boss, he had to be the boss ... Only when light came would he have a chance to win against neo martial.As for Li Hao, he didn't want to waste his energy. If the light Emperor really came, it would be difficult to deal with him. He had a good relationship with Kong Ji. If the light Emperor came and Kong Ji called him father, what would he call him?At that time, it would be troublesome. It would be better to leave it to new martial arts. Over there, the human King would call them brothers whenever he opened his mouth. The light Emperor would be suppressed and would not cause trouble.The human King was very overbearing and could turn hostile very quickly. The light Thearch didn't dare to be too unreasonable.When it came to his side ... He might not be able to lose face, and it would be difficult to deal with him.Of course, these words did not need to be said.Kong Ji obviously understood this truth. Otherwise, he would not have opened his mouth and said that he would give light to neo martial.For a moment, no one continued to talk about this.Li Hao found a lightning pillar with the Black Panther and began to comprehend it in silence. He tried to condense a new little world. Now that his thousand world was complete, the Queen was still providing him with a large amount of chaotic energy. While there weren't too many, he should condense a few little realms as soon as possible to avoid bursting.At the same time, he could also absorb some power of the Thunder tribulation. If he could upgrade the world of destruction and the world of tribulation sword to the peak level, he might be able to become a seventh level venerable sovereign completely. Although there was nothing special about seventh level venerable sovereigns, at least he would look much better.At this moment, Li Hao absorbed the energy in peace and didn't care about anything else.The others also began to stabilize their own realm and strength.The Thunder region was finally quiet.

Chapter 3344 Confrontation (1)
Thunder region.A large amount of lightning power poured into Li Hao's River, and one of the worlds kept expanding.The aura of the peak of the sixth step appeared on Li Hao's body.This aura only represented one of them. After reaching the peak of the sixth step, the increase in strength was not as great as imagined. Even after reaching the seventh step, even if there was an increase, it might not be as great as imagined.Even so, Li Hao was already very satisfied. In the lightning territory, the biggest gain was not the problem of realm and strength, nor the change in the 10000 streaks of lightning, but ... In the future, when lightning struck him again, an Ordinary Level Seven lightning would no longer cause him any trouble.In fact, it might even become his nourishment, nourishing his calamity sword path.This was what he was most satisfied with!Li Hao would linger around each pillar of lightning for a while to guide its Dao. His main purpose was not to comprehend it himself, but to give the Black Panther an understanding of the lightning tribulation.He had hoped that Black Panther could comprehend the Dao of calamity.This way, he could create a special world with the Silver Moon double Dao ring world as its core. This would also increase Black Panther's prospects.Heibao had been following Li Hao the whole time.Li Hao also didn't want to be left behind by others because the Black Panther was a demon.Therefore, this time, which was a rare occasion, Li Hao deliberately opened the back door for a certain someone ... A certain dog.He rarely interfered with other people's cultivation methods. As for the choice of a great Dao ... He rarely interfered with someone's choice. Even if his teacher was unwilling to corroborate his Dao as a venerable sovereign, he didn't care.Be it the Queen, the king of Li Dynasty, or Lin Hongyu ...These people had chosen their own paths.On the other hand, Li Hao had given away the Earthcover sword to Hong Yitang, but he didn't interfere too much with Hong Yitang's path of controlling the bed.When it came to Black Panther, Li Hao's interference was much greater.The Black Panther had always focused on the path of water. Under the influence of Liu Long's nine refinements, it rarely knew how to use the lightning punishment force left behind by its ancestors. It also knew how to use the five birds technique, but it rarely used it.On the other hand, the ninth refinement had not given up and had even surpassed Liu Long.The Black Panther actually had another innate ability. In Li Hao's opinion, its hidden ability, which was to transform into a mortal, was the best. However, it could only be used as a supplementary ability. The power of calamity and its offensive ability were still extremely strong.As for the nine-refinements, it used nine layers as the core. The power of the Tribulation lightning had always been stacked. Nine layers formed a cycle. "As the saying goes, when one man attains Dao, his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven!"At this moment, Li Hao was giving a lecture to the Black Panther. When he got excited, he was all smiles, which was rare for him.As he thought back to the past, he subconsciously got distracted and changed the topic from the path of the lightning tribulation to recalling the past."At that time, the starry sky sword's first cup of soup was drunk by you ... I only drank the water that you used to wash my feet ...""At that time, the red shadow of the red moon organization appeared. I was afraid, but ever since I got a dog ... I've been a little more at ease.""Why do you think I want to keep a stray dog?"Li Hao laughed."Old people say that cats and dogs can see things that others can 'T. I thought that it would be too scary if I saw it alone, so I might as well have one more person to see it ... But it's hard to predict the human heart, and I don't dare to relax. Plus, I don't know who can see it. So, I saw you, and when I looked at you ... The old man said that white cats and black dogs are rare in the world, and they are all spiritual creatures!""As expected, after I raised you, you seemed to be able to see red Shadows ... At that time, I felt more at ease when I went out with you."The Black Panther wagged its tail.The Black Panther naturally didn't know about the twists and turns of Li Hao's adoption.Li Hao had never mentioned it.He had also thought about it earlier that perhaps it was just pure loneliness, living alone with no friends or family.But now, it seemed that it had the intention of strengthening his courage.It was laughable when he thought about it."Since you're willing to follow me ... I can't decide the fate of others, and I can't decide it. However, since you can't speak and can't express your thoughts, I'll make the decision for you. It can be considered as fulfilling your destiny as a ruler."The Black Panther wagged its tail, its eyes filled with adoration, but it was somewhat at ease.This was exactly what it wanted."Therefore, it is true that the Dao of tribulation is difficult to cultivate! You might not be able to cultivate it ... But since I'm your master, I'll naturally help you cultivate it ... Even if you can't cultivate it yourself, I'll help you forcefully cultivate it. Even if it's just a form, it's enough!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At this point, Li Hao returned to the main topic.""You've been putting in a lot of effort over the past few days,"he said." However, even if I were to pass on so many great Daoist magics to you at once, you wouldn't be able to comprehend them in detail ...."Li Hao hesitated for a moment, but still said,""I have an idea, I wonder if you're willing to accept it?"Heibao looked at Li Hao. He didn't say anything, but was confused."In my opinion, the Dao of calamity should be much easier than time," Li Hao said."I've comprehended a thousand DAOs and condensed a thousand worlds. I'll cut out a part of the power of a great Dao from my thousand worlds ... And construct a miniature Dao River for you!""You are now the Silvermoon heaven's will ... You control the Silvermoon world and connect the two Dao rivers ... I thought about it and decided that you should use the power of the Heaven's Will to connect the Dao rivers and use a small Dao River to connect the two Dao universes. This way ... Every time I have a new understanding, you just have to do what I tell you to do. This way, even if you don't understand, you can still create the power of the Tribulation lightning ..."

Chapter 3345 Confrontation (2)
Simply put, it was copying, copying.He didn't need the Black Panther to understand it. Counting on a dog to cultivate 10000 DAOs was simply too difficult. He might as well follow his own instructions, and let the Black Panther do as he pleased.Although this was somewhat like a puppet ... For Li Hao, since the Black Panther was willing to follow him and be his pet, then ... He didn't need to think too much.He just had to arrange everything for it.Now, it was actually very difficult for the black leopard to improve. After devouring countless amounts of energy, the two great Dao Masters had reached the peak of rank six. However, the black leopard was getting slower and slower. On the contrary, it had not improved as quickly as before. Even now, it was still struggling to reach rank six.If this continued, the sixth step might be the Black Panther's limit."Black Panther, do you have any objections?"The Black Panther wagged its tail. Li Hao smiled.""That means you have no objections!"At this moment, Li Hao began to construct a small-scale River of a thousand realms. In fact, this was also his first attempt. He wanted to see if he could create a small chaos independent of chaos ... Although this small chaos was a bit exaggerated, as it was only constructed by a thousand DAOs.However, if a Dao domain could be independent of others, it meant that it had a stable Foundation.It also meant that Li Hao's path had not been wrong yet.Small stars were formed by Li Hao, and a long sword appeared in his hand. Li Hao looked at the Black Panther and stared at its head for a while."The miniature Dao River needs a space to contain it ... It can't be left where it is. It has to follow you. There is a space in your body, and Silvermoon is in it. I want to enter your body and see if I can open up another independent space in your body and put this miniature universe in it."This could also be considered a different form of splitting open the sky.Secondly, Li Hao was also very curious about what was so special about the structure of chaos beasts.Why was it that when chaos beasts devoured worlds, they could easily absorb them into their bodies?Other than having a strong body, there must be something special about it.This was also an opportunity for research!Cut the Black Panther Open and see ...As for Black Panther, seeing Li Hao holding the sword and looking at him, he seemed to ... Make a dog's scalp tingle. What was he doing?Li Hao stroked the dog's head, as if he could see the Black Panther's nervousness. He laughed. "Don't be afraid, it's fine. Do you think I'll kill you? I'll try to open up a small space in your body and study how to create an independent space in your body. Since the human King created an inner world, I also want to try to turn my body into chaos ... However, I haven't found a good starting point. "This was also why Li Hao was hesitating. Even though he was constantly training his physical body, he could not catch up to the Beasts of Chaos.Even if he did make it in time ... For example, his physical body couldn't be weaker than the Black Panther 's, who was only at the fifth step.However ... It was not difficult for Li Hao to carry a world in his stomach, provided that it was a compressed world, not a world that contained life and ten billion humans.This was the key!Why can't I?  In addition, it was possible for chaos beasts and the Queen's divine Kingdom. The two originally had nothing in common, but Li Hao judged that they were likely related to the chaos great Dao they were attached to.The Chaos Beast and the Queen were able to lead countless people and establish their own space Kingdom. It might be because they were attached to the Dao of chaos that they had such an outcome.As for how he could imitate it and open up chaos in his own body, he might need to do some in-depth research.Although the Black Panther was a little apprehensive, it still obediently opened its mouth.Its mouth was like a black hole!Li Hao laughed and stepped into the Black Panther's belly with his sword.……The Silvermoon world was within the Black Panther's body.The inside of the Beast of Chaos seemed to be an independent space between heaven and earth.The NA Xu mi technique!In the past, Li Hao didn't care too much about these things. But now, he had his own ideas and path. If he wanted to create chaos, the first problem he had to face was how to solve the problem of his internal Dao.Otherwise, his body would not be able to withstand the thousand realms. If more realms appeared in the future, how could he withstand it?After entering the Black Panther's stomach, Li Hao sensed for a while. After a long time, he looked at the Silvermoon world.It was hard to see anything. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At this moment, the force God appeared. It was invisible to the naked eye, but perhaps it could see something. As expected, when the force God appeared, Li Hao vaguely saw something.Chaos!There was a feeling similar to the chaos World inside the chaos beasts 'bodies. It was as if there was a great Dao that led to the depths of the chaos and rooted in the chaos beasts' bodies. These chaos beasts were connected to the chaos probably because of the chaos Dao."In that case ... It's not that chaos beasts can nurture a world, but ... Their physical bodies are actually connected to chaos, and that's why they can easily integrate a world?"But ... In that case, if one didn't rely on the Dao of chaos, one wouldn't be able to achieve the same abilities as the Chaos Beast?The Queen was able to build a God Kingdom because it was also dependent on the Dao of chaos?And what was the Dao of chaos?It was chaotic, a mixture of the ways of disorder.However, there were also some chaotic DAOs that did not exist, such as ... The birth of life. There might be a huge source of life in the chaos.

Chapter 3346 Confrontation (3)
"In that case ... It's very difficult for me to imitate ...""However, if I use the world's source of life and the chaotic force, can I simulate a chaotic and chaotic Dao?"Li Hao did not attach himself to the chaotic great DAOs that existed in the chaos.That would have wasted all his efforts and he would have to spend a lot of time sorting out everything."Since I can't attach myself to the real Dao of chaos, can I construct a fake Dao of chaos and then use it to seep out of my body? I'll absorb the power of Chaos and merge it into the chaos Space like a river of Dao. Then, I'll have the power of the Chaos Beast and be able to run with the world.Running with the world was not his goal. His goal was to create a world in his own body.Many thoughts were born.Li Hao fell into deep thought again.After a long time, he slashed out with his sword, cutting out a space in the Black Panther's body. The next moment, a miniature world appeared on the long sword.These little realms instantly stabilized within the Black Panther's body.Gradually, it began to construct a Dao net.The Black Panther didn't feel uncomfortable, either. Li Hao quickly constructed it, and gradually, a new universe seemed to be formed here. Stars floated in the sky, somewhat similar to the universe of the great path.The next step would be to connect the Silver Moon Dao and the Silver Moon world.Li Hao began to connect the worlds. Small stars spread across the entire Silvermoon world like a spider web. The two Dao Masters sensed it, but they didn't show themselves.He allowed Li Hao to penetrate the Dao of the small realms into the river of the great Dao. Then, through the Silver Moon world, he returned to his original place, forming a special system of the thousand realms.……In the lightning territory.Black Panther allowed Li Hao to use it, even though he knew very well that it would be very difficult to get rid of Li Hao in the future ... But why should he?He was just a stray dog on the streets.At that time, they were both hungry and cold, almost starving to death on the streets.Li Hao brought him home ... Although it was only a simple kennel downstairs, there was food, a place to live, and no longer being kicked around or driven away. During that period, the Black Panther seemed to be at the peak of his dog life.As for his later training and his later strength ... It was only to continue following Li Hao.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  How big could a dog's dream be?It wasn't born a demon. It was just a mortal dog. As for the so-called descendant of a demon subduer ... It had nothing to do with it. The Black Panther had only felt it after cultivating. Even the descendant of the heavenly Hound would starve to death, let alone the descendant of a demon subduer.In the past 100000 years in the Silvermoon world, who knew how many dogs had starved to death? who knew how many dogs had been killed? perhaps they were all descendants of the demon subduing envoy. Now that he had stepped into level five, he was in control of a world.It was already unbelievable!Everyone knew that the new martial arts were famous in the four regions. However, Black Panther had never thought about it. Why did he want to be known by others?Did it have any use?It was better to remain unknown. As long as she could follow Li Hao, even if she didn't speak for the rest of her life ... Wouldn't that be normal?A dog, a talking dog, was that still a dog?It was a dog, and it had never thought of being a human. Was being a human as comfortable as being a dog?With this in mind, whether Li Hao was studying it or doing something else ... The Black Panther was crouching in the lightning territory. Tribulation lightning vaguely appeared above its head, but the Black Panther was still unbothered.There seemed to be some changes in his body.Li Hao was constructing a miniature calamity domain for it. As for whether it would succeed, whether it would become powerful after it succeeded, or whether it couldn't strengthen itself in the future ... These were not in the Black Panther's consideration.After an unknown period of time, Black Panther suddenly felt that he had become closer to the lightning territory.Subconsciously, it tried to capture some of the power of the lightning ... But in the next moment, a part of the lightning tribulation above its head disappeared. In the blink of an eye, it appeared before the Black Panther. However, it quickly dissipated and did not take form.……The next moment, Li Hao walked out of the black Panther's belly.He glanced at the lightning territory and felt a little regretful."The construction went very smoothly ... However, I haven't fully mastered the power of calamity yet. If I had fully mastered it, I would have been the master of calamity! I can only say that you can barely control a part of it ... You can try to use the power of lightning as the main force and not the power of tribulation!" Li Hao continued."Earlier, you used lightning. Today, you'll still control lightning according to your old habits. First, use the power of lightning as an attack. Then, try again and gradually add something that belongs to you ... For example, the power of water. Water lightning is also lightning ..."Li Hao chuckled and looked at Black Panther, who also seemed to be in high spirits.The dog waved its paw, and the power of lightning seemed to appear. The next moment, it waved its paw, and the lightning did not burst out. Instead, the paw grabbed into the void. The paw seemed to have some power of lightning. The power of lightning gathered together, and some power of water seeped out. In an instant, the Black Panther's fur stood on end from the electricity!"Take it slow. I'm definitely not used to it at first, but it'll get better after some time.""Woof woof ..."The Black Panther nodded its huge head in excitement.He didn't think there was anything bad about it.As for Li Hao, he glanced at the Black Panther, his heart filled with emotions ... This dog was still as obedient as ever.

Chapter 3347 Confrontation (Part 4)
There were actually many demons around him.Second cat was one of them, so was power over the sea, and also those monster plants ...Second cat was very strong, and Li Hao had always been very polite to him. But only to Black Panther could he be unrestrained and have no scruples, because this was a dog that he had raised personally.But second cat wasn 't.Even if second cat looked cuter, more powerful, and treated him quite well ... In the end, he still felt like he was facing an elder when facing second cat. As for Black Panther, Li Hao knew that he was the one who raised him.……Li Hao stayed in the lightning territory for a few more days, absorbing the power of the Thunder tribulation to replenish his consumption, improve his system, and strengthen his sword of tribulation. He also helped the Black Panther capture a part of the power of the Thunder tribulation to use as cultivation resources.Li Hao didn't stop his training until he reached Level 7.He didn't care too much about Grade 7 or not.After reaching the peak of the sixth step for some time, Li Hao stopped his training. If he really reached the seventh step, he might be more eye-catching. At this moment, the peak of the sixth step was neither strong nor weak, and he was not considered weak no matter where he went. However, he was not as eye-catching as the seventh step.This was more in line with Li Hao's personality.It was good as long as he wasn't too eye-catching, and he wouldn't be looked down upon.……Thunder region.Wu Shan had returned, and this time, he had brought forest orchid master with him. Forest orchid master had been happy to come, as he had also felt the turmoil in the four-direction domain.Senlan had just stepped into Level Seven. Although she had devoured a large amount of Crimson Moon Power last time, she was not considered weak.However, Supreme Emperor Senlan had cooperated with new martial and Li Hao before. If the Dragon Lord really made trouble, he, a seventh-rank, would not be able to stop these experts.Wu Shan went to look for it, and monarch Senlan happily followed. The world was absorbed into er Mao's stomach. Er Mao was different when it came to facing the lightning tribulation. It could also travel through the lightning territory, but it was not fast enough.Within the realm.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  When Li Hao returned, everyone heaved a sigh of relief."Is it impossible to reach Level Seven?" the Thunderbolt master was a little puzzled.​ Li Hao had said before that he would try to reach Level Seven. Was it because he couldn't reach Level Seven?"Tier 7 is a little eye-catching. There's no hurry. It's not difficult for me to enter ... But it won't improve my strength much. It's the same whether I enter or not."Li Hao laughed and looked at the crowd. Now, he could be considered to have many experts on his side.Two level eight venerable sovereigns!Then, er Mao, Kong Ji, Dao Qi, and Sen LAN were all seventh level venerable sovereigns. He should also be considered a seventh level expert. This kind of strength was not weaker than an eighth level universe.Even if there were two level eight venerable sovereigns, they might only be comparable to a level eight venerable sovereign who was in charge of the local area. That would be enough.It had only been three years since Silver Moon had left. Li Hao had grown from being the only first level venerable sovereign in Silver Moon to having nearly a hundred of them, including a few advanced venerable sovereigns. It was already a shocking sight.Monarch Wushan didn't say much and only said,""The four-sided domain has been very quiet these days! Only red Moon sovereign was traveling around, as if he was trying to persuade some rank seven masters not to participate in the battle between new martial, the chaos race, and the Silver Moon. The Dragon field, on the other hand, has barely made any moves ..."He was a little conflicted."The more it's like this, the more worried I am. Previously, so many experts of the chaos race died, but the Dragon Lord, this peak tier 8, didn't make any movements at all ... Instead, it's making me uneasy!"If the other party flew into a rage, it would be better. It meant that he was really angry. If he was angry, it also meant that he was greatly affected.But now, the Dragon field was frighteningly quiet.Even he felt that it was inappropriate, not to mention the others.In the Dragon field, the five great demon worlds were extremely worried that the Dragon Lord would seek them out for revenge. These days, they had been approaching the Thunder field, probably because they were worried that the Dragon Lord would launch a thunderous attack. At this moment, they didn't know who to cooperate with.The new martial artists were difficult to deal with, but on Silver moon's side, Li Hao did not seem to have any intention of allying with the demons.The demon race had eight Level Seven venerable sovereigns ... At first, the iron-eating venerable sovereign thought that the two sides would take the initiative to approach them. In the end, both sides ignored them, which made him feel terrible.He had thought that after killing so many seventh rank venerable sovereigns, the Dragon Lord's strength would be greatly reduced. At that time, when the venerable sovereigns like Yun Xiao and Chi Yang were still around, the Dragon Lord would be more or less afraid and would not dare to fight with the monster race.However, who would have thought that the two rank eight venerable sovereigns were also gone."Dragon Lord ..."Li Hao nodded,"he's a difficult person to deal with!" The quieter it was, the more terrifying it was! We're digesting what we've gained from the last war, and the Dragon Lord must be doing the same. He's not without any gains either. He killed two rank eight venerable sovereigns and two rank seven venerable sovereigns ...""However, they probably won't care about us for the time being."Wu Shan nodded and thought for a moment before saying,"do you have any thoughts about the monster race?" The five realms of the demon race don't seem to be doing well recently. I think that if one of us were to go and say a few words now, we might be able to recruit the eight Level Seven venerable sovereigns! He might even take the five worlds under his command ..."This was a great opportunity to strengthen himself!At most, he could make a few more trips and move the five rank Seven Worlds into the Thunder territory. He could use the Thunder territory to carry these worlds out and develop them in the outer region. With the help of eight rank seven venerable sovereigns, Li Hao's strength would undergo a tremendous change.He had become one of the three true overlords of the four-sided domain!

Chapter 3348 Confrontation (Part 5)
Even in the outer region, they were overlords. The outer region was vast and powerful, but it was rare for a force to have two rank eights and more than ten rank seven venerable sovereigns."No!"Li Hao shook his head."The demons aren't willing to submit to anyone. Even the chaos race is unwilling to submit to them. The iron-eaters are very rebellious and have the intention of fighting to the death. We'll only be asking for trouble if we subdue them! As for the other realms, there are those who want to join us, but they've been threatened and are being led by the three venerable sovereigns of the iron-eating race to resist ..."Li Hao pondered for a while and said,"I think it's impossible for the iron-eating race to leave the square domain with the demons. If the iron-eating Thearch is wise, he might leave with the iron-eating race and seek independence. Otherwise ... They will be killed by the Dragon Lord sooner or later!""Then ... Aren't we going to stop them?" the Thunderbolt master's expression turned grave."Stop them?"Stop what?Li Hao shook his head."The Dragon Lord isn't easy to deal with at the moment. There's no need for us to find trouble. The demons chose to resist that day, and since they resisted, they should be more resolute. However, in the later stages, only the iron-eaters were extremely determined. The other worlds weren't too determined ... If we take them in, we might be in more trouble!"After saying that, Li Hao looked outside the lightning territory and said,""We don't have to worry too much. Whether it's a blessing or a curse, they know it clearly and should make their own choices. They can either give up the five realms and escape while the Thunder region is peaceful. Otherwise ... It'll be difficult!""They can't bear to part with the world, and they want others to save them, but they're not willing to put in too much effort. That's impossible."Li Hao didn't continue talking about the demons of the five regions. If it was wise, the iron-eating demons would give up on the level 7 great world and find a small or medium-sized world to take the iron-eating demons into their bodies and escape.There was a high chance that they would not be able to take a large world with them, but three level 7s and a small to medium world would not be a problem.In this case, there was still a way out.Besides, they weren't very familiar with each other. Their cooperation last time was just to get what they needed. Li Hao didn't intend to help the demons solve their crisis."We should go!"Li Hao looked around and quickly said,""I've stayed in the Thunder region for a period of time. If I continue to stay here, the Thunder World will soon be unable to withstand it!""Has he left?"The Thunderbolt master looked outside and sighed,""To the outer area ... I don't know much about the outer area. I only know that a ninth level venerable sovereign has been born recently, and he seems to be waging a war. The outer area is not very peaceful!"Although the chaos was huge, it didn't seem that huge.The four-sided region wasn't peaceful, and neither was the outer region.Li Hao, however, raised his eyebrows and thought, you're only a level nine, but you're still thinking of unifying chaos ... That's actually very childish! At this stage, unless it's to establish order, there's no need to unify the chaos. Even if it devours ten thousand worlds, it might not be able to strengthen itself ... At this level, it should be more important to consider how to further improve on the ten thousand DAOs return to one. "Upon hearing that a level 9 alien was still waging war to unify the chaos ... Li Hao felt that this level 9 ... Was probably not much.However, he had some doubts.Was it really a ninth-rank?At least 9000 type 9 DAOs had fused into one. Such an expert could easily suppress a type 8. Even an existence like the Dragon Lord would find it hard to match. If a type 9 expert appeared, it would be impossible to defend against without another type 9. Was there a need to go through so much trouble?He wasn't too sure, but he wasn't too afraid.""It's fine. They shouldn't be fighting around here for the time being, because ... The Lord of calamity and the Lord of Tian Fang might both be alive. If the other party is also a tier 9, they should be able to sense it ..."Although it might not be considered their territory outside of the four-direction region, a newly advanced level nine should not rashly attack this side. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт   "Let's go to the outer region to take a look first ..."Li Hao thought for a moment."This time, when we go out ... It won't be about devouring great DAOs or seizing worlds. Of course, if we encounter them, like the Twin realms, we can try.""My greater goal for this trip is still to establish the myriad Dao system ... So, I really want to discuss the Dao with some experts and not fight them the moment I see them!"Li Hao was also helpless.In fact, he had been thinking this since the beginning. However, these experts in the chaos didn't seem to have such thoughts.Who has the time to discuss Dao with you?A group of powerhouses at Level Seven or eight were still planning to invade the world all day long. They would not discuss Dao with you at all. As long as you killed them, you could comprehend the other party's Dao after they died.It had to be said ... That this was what Li Hao regretted.After cultivating to this stage, wasn't it good to have an exchange?Other than thinking about devouring other worlds, these guys seemed to have nothing else to do.The group of people no longer said anything. The Thunder Emperor also controlled the Thunder World and began to move out of the Thunder region at a slow speed.……At the same time.In the Dragon field.The Dragon Lord had completed the construction of his own Dao domain.Within the dragon world, a monstrous aura appeared. A Black Tiger, like a ghost from hell, appeared between heaven and earth. At this moment, the group of chaos beasts were extremely excited!Level 8!It must be at the eighth step!The chaos race had given birth to their second level eight venerable sovereign!At this moment, the Dragon Master also revealed a faint smile. The black Tiger had lived up to his expectations and had finally entered level eight. Although it had devoured the bodies of two level eight experts, it was still very difficult to enter level eight. After all, these two level eight experts did not bring their world or their great path universes. They only had the power of level eight great paths.

Chapter 3349 Confrontation (6)
As such, it wasn't easy to produce a rank eight."Congratulations!"The Dragon Master floated up. Below him, the black Tiger Thearch was excited and angry. He looked at the Thunder region in the distance and shouted,""Thank you for your help, Dragon Lord! Black Tiger has reached the 8th step, and he will kill the Silver Moon King sooner or later to avenge everyone!"The Dragon Master nodded slightly and did not say anything more.As for the black Tiger, it seemed to have sensed something in the next moment. It looked at the Dragon Master in confusion. The Dragon Master seemed to be one with the dragon world in the past, but now, he seemed to be out of place.In fact, the dragon world seemed to be rejecting it.What ... What was going on?"You can tell?"The black Tiger was puzzled and could not help but say,"Dragon Lord, this is ...""Feng Yan inherited the dragon world."The black Tiger was shocked!How could this be?"There's no need to make a fuss. When it reaches level 8 ..."He looked at the black Tiger."At this level, the key is to construct one's own Dao domain! If you want to go further on the path of the eighth step ... Then you have to learn this. "The Dragon Lord laughed. He then looked at the experts who were rapidly gathering from all directions and said,""Black Tiger has entered the 8th rank ... Feng Yan has entered the 7th rank. Now, six new 7th rank experts have been born ..."After devouring the six great worlds, the six peak rank six chaos beasts had all completed their advancement.At this point, he had 20 Type 7 experts under him.As for level eight venerable sovereigns, including himself, there were a total of three.With such strength, it was enough to sweep across the world."Black Tiger, join forces with Red Moon and lead everyone to take down the five demon worlds!"He looked at the black Tiger. The black Tiger was stunned. This ... Can I?Although there were only eight rank seven venerable sovereigns in the five demon clans, they all controlled the world. Iron eater venerable Emperor was also a peak rank seven venerable sovereign. His combat strength was extremely strong. If they fought in their own territory, they might not be any weaker than him, who had just entered rank eight."Don't worry, the eight venerable sovereigns of the five demon clans ... If you really go, I'll still be here this time. At least a few of them will surrender ...""This time, we'll definitely be able to take them down!" The Dragon Lord said calmly."As for me ... I'll go to the light to take a look.""Neo martial might interfere. I'll go over there and take a look ..." The Dragon Master smiled."Then ... What about Silver Moon?" The black Tiger was a little hesitant. The Dragon Lord looked at the Thunder region in the distance and smiled,""Silver Moon ... Might not interfere. That Li Hao didn't take anyone from the demon clan of the five directions away previously, so he might not interfere this time either. If he really does leave the lightning territory, I don't mind killing him!"After saying that, he didn't say anything more."I'll go to neo martial to take a look. You guys set off immediately. This time, there's no world to bring. I'll let Hong Yue follow you to ensure that nothing goes wrong!""Dragon Master, why don't you let Red Moon go with you? it's said that neo martial has completely entered the eighth rank over there ... And the light Supreme Emperor is also an eighth rank senior Supreme Emperor ..."The others were a little worried.The Phoenix Flame also appeared instantly. The aura on its body was somewhat unstable, but it was still at the seventh-rank. At this moment, he was also a little worried.It was still extremely dangerous for the Dragon Master to go to new martial arts alone.Although everyone believed that his strength was monstrous, but ... The neo martial human king and emperor Cang could suppress level eights when they were at Level Seven, not to mention now that they had both stepped into level eight!"They might not really fight ... Don't worry!"The Dragon Master smiled."The enmity between us and new martial ... Isn't too deep. In fact, there isn't even any." Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Did I?In fact, there was really no enmity between them.The person he had a grudge against was Li Hao.New martial arts had a Supreme, who was a smart person. At this moment, would he fall out with the Dragon Master?Not necessarily.He was just going to take a look.The Dragon Lord did not say anything more and laughed. "I'll go over first ... It's best if you can take him down. If you can 't, kill as many as you can. Also, tell iron Shishi that if he's willing to surrender, I can spare his life! If we don't surrender, we will die!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.Seeing this, the black Tiger's expression changed slightly. He did not say anything more, gritted his teeth, and roared,""We ... Should take revenge!"Since he couldn't kill Li Hao, he might as well kill the demons.If it weren't for these guys causing trouble last time, they wouldn't have suffered such heavy losses.The group of advanced venerable sovereigns were all furious. Without saying anything, they all entered the void and headed straight for the five demon realms!……Without the Dao universe, Dragon Master was extremely fast when he was traveling.He would instantly appear wherever his Dao domain covered.A Dao domain that was completely constructed by one's own self would be more comfortable to use.In just a moment, the four-sided domain, which previously took him a long time to cross, was now easily crossed by him.In the distance.Within the divine light realm.The human King frowned slightly. In the next moment, he appeared outside the boundary. In the blink of an eye, a cat followed him silently.Another moment later, the light Thearch appeared with a grave expression.Soon, the rank seven venerable sovereigns arrived.The radiance Thearch looked around. At this moment, only the Dragon Master appeared in the void in the distance. He heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the Dragon Master was not the only one who had come to invade.At this moment, a divine light appeared in the human King's eyes as he looked at the Dragon Master. After a long while, he suddenly chuckled,""Old dragon, you have some courage!"The Dragon Master also looked at the human King and sized him up. He smiled and said,""The last time I saw you kill Chi Yang, I knew you weren't as reckless as I thought! However, until now, I still have some doubts that haven't been solved. Has your new martial arts ... Ever produced a ninth level venerable sovereign?"
