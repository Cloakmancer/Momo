        Should I try?
        Forget it!
        He thought about it and remembered his teacher's advice. Forget it, he didn't even think about becoming a superpower.
        Seeing that Wang Ming didn't believe him, he didn't argue, but instead asked curiously,"Old Wang, if you found 5, what kind of level are you among the night watchers?"
        "Top-notch standard!"
        "Three brilliant rays of the sun, four three yang, five ... That means I have a chance of entering the realm above three yang!" Wang Ming said proudly.
        "Then what about the nine?"
        Li Hao smiled."Since you said that someone has discovered nine of them in this domain, it means that someone must have discovered them before and spread them. According to you, one of them is a realm. Then, nine of them ... Isn't that unimaginable?"
        Wang Ming shook his head."Someone has discovered the ninth. It's a heavenly priest in the central region. He's also an old heavenly priest, and it's said that he's already above the three suns realm." According to the information that was spread by that person, it was normal for the Super Lock to be harder to open at the later stages. However, it was said that the higher the level, the more dangerous it would be to unlock the Super Lock. They would often encounter some unpredictable dangers! At this stage, it seems that only five people have opened the Super Lock. Whether they have opened the sixth and entered the higher level above the three yang ... This is not clear!"
        He added,"it's just a matter of time!" Because the development of superpowers was very fast, twenty years ago, there were only starlight Masters, and less than a year later, moon underworld Masters appeared. In less than three years, the sunlit division had appeared. "I asked around before, and the three suns have appeared for more than ten years! And above the three suns, in the central region, it had actually appeared five years ago!"
         In the short 20 years, there were already five different levels.
        It had been five years since the emergence of the previous level. At this rate, it was possible that powerhouses of the sixth level would appear soon.
        Li Hao was also secretly shocked.
        This speed was really fast.
        Perhaps, in the end, a powerhouse of the ninth level would really appear.
        "Are there many above three suns in the central region?"
        "Quite a lot!"
        Wang Ming said casually, but didn't continue. Instead, he smiled."Now you know why I'm a genius? I'm absorbing the mysterious energy at a high speed and efficiency. For example, Hu Hao and Li Meng, they're not bad among the Nightwatchers. However, they only found three super locks, which means that they have a direction to enter sunlight. However, after entering sunlight, they have no direction. "
        He lifted himself up a little, and at the same time, lowered Li Meng and the rest.
        Shameless!
        However, to be able to discover three paths was already not bad. Some people at the Dark Moon realm might not even be able to discover the third path. If they could not find the path of sunlit, they could only slowly grind.
        The superpower lock was the barrier that limited the advancement of a superpower.
        "So, as long as you break the third lock, you can directly become a sunlit ... There won't be any major bottlenecks?"
        "Yeah!"  Wang Ming chuckled and nodded."Therefore, I want to use the mysterious energy from this reward to enter full moon. Then ... I want to borrow the power of the blood God. If it's really as you said, it can enhance the effect of the mysterious energy. Perhaps it can help me open the third Super Lock and enter the glorious sun!"
        Then, he thought expectantly,'if that's the case, my progress might even be as fast as those God-tier Masters! Li Hao, don't try to fool me. I want to apply to the headquarters to exchange for that sunbeams-level Blood God! If it doesn't work ... Then I'll be out of luck. "
        "That thing can be exchanged?"
        "Of course!"
        Wang Ming nodded,"the night patrolmen also talk about merits." The treasures were meant to be exchanged for everyone. Minister hou had said that the treasures and resources would only be valuable when they were circulated! "Not many people have been able to exchange for the blood God clones, because they're quite useful to new people. New people don't want to pay such a high price for them, so they kept a few. Not many people care about them now. If you're certain, I'll think of a way to exchange them."
        "How much is it?"
        "Then what's the price of a Blood God at the radiant sun level?" Li Hao asked curiously.
        "It's not just the price!"
        Wang Ming explained again,"you also need a rank. The rank system of the inspection Office requires a high enough rank!" I'm a patrol, so I can't exchange for it. But I know a lot of patrol envoys, and so is our Minister, so I can ask them to help me exchange for it. "
        "What's the price?"
        " 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy!"
        "So cheap?"
        Li Hao was stunned."My teacher bought it from our department head for 300 cubic meters. Department head Hao even said that it couldn't be sold."
         Was it cheap?
        Wang Ming was speechless. This tone ... Was really F * cking arrogant!
        However, to tell a teacher who killed two third Suns that 200 cubic meters was very expensive ... Forget it, what the hell does this guy know?
        "It's different!"
        "There's a limit to the number of times you can exchange treasures,"Wang Ming explained." Otherwise, everyone would've gone to the higher-ups to exchange for treasures, and it would've been relatively cheaper because there's a limit. There's no limit to the rewards. This kind of opportunity is hard to come by for many people. "
        Okay.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was 100 cubic meters, which was not cheap.
        It made sense. Powerhouses at the sunlit realm could only extract two to three hundred cubic meters of mysterious energy when they died, and the red shadow was about the same. It was quite appropriate to sell it at this price.
        It would be better to use the mysterious energy to cultivate. For superpowers, the mysterious energy was more useful than the power of the red shadow.
        Wang Ming should be able to produce 200 cubic meters.
       
        Previously, he had received more than 100 yuan. Besides, his family was rich and powerful, so it should not be a problem.
        However, from the looks of it, this fellow was also very conflicted. He was afraid that it would be useless and that it would go to waste. It seemed that 200 cubic meters was a huge sum of money to him.
        At this moment, Li Hao had a better understanding of superpowers.
        According to Wang Ming, this guy still had hope of entering three yang and above, which was a little surprising.
        "You can change as much as you want. If you don't want it, I'll still spend 300 cubic meters to buy it back, and you'll still earn a profit, okay?"
        "Really?"
        Wang Ming was delighted. There was such a good thing?
        Even if he didn't use it, he would make a profit by selling it.
        Was he giving her money?
        Otherwise, Liu Long would have been willing to help Li Hao exchange for it. Even if he could only exchange for it once, even if he only had this one chance, Liu Long wouldn't have cared.
         Li Hao nodded.
        Was it a loss?
        He wouldn't make a loss. Besides, he couldn't find a suitable person to exchange for it. As for Liu Long, he had just entered the Qian dynasty. Although Li Hao didn't know if such an exchange opportunity was important, his Captain might need such an opportunity in the future.
        This was because they would be going to the ruins next. If they were to gain something, they would definitely need this opportunity.
        "Don't go to the boss to exchange for it. If you have your own way, then solve it yourself!"
        Wang Ming nodded. He had just said that, and hadn't intended to ask Liu Long to help him.
        ……
        The two of them continued walking down the stairs.
        Seeing that he was still following him, Li Hao was really surprised. I've already said that you should change. Why are you still following me?
        "You ..."
        "Let's see how you and Minister Liu spar. Can we watch?"
        Wang Ming explained,"haven't I also been learning the five birds technique recently?" But the teacher only gave me a booklet with nothing, so I was too embarrassed to ask. I could only try to figure it out myself. I feel that I've improved, but I also feel that I haven't ... Li Hao, when you spar, can I take a look?"
        He was now interested in the path of martial masters.
        He had been studying the five birds technique recently, but unfortunately, Yuan Shuo had only given them a secret technique and an ordinary breathing technique, so he didn't feel like he had made much progress.
        "I haven't been using the five birds technique much recently."
        Li Hao spoke the truth. Recently, he had mainly been comprehending force and sword, and sparring wasn't the main focus of his five birds technique.
        "Alright, if it's inconvenient, then I won't watch. Why are you being so mysterious ... The next time I'm sparring with someone, you can watch however you want!"
        Li Hao smiled and didn't say anything.
        In the next few days, he might enter a state of Great Perfection. Besides, it was good to keep a low profile. Too many people knew about it now. Although Wang Ming was a good person, he was too involved with Whitemoon city, after all.
        It would not be good if the secret was leaked ...
        The key was that this guy's mouth was too big, and to put it bluntly, he was a little naive.
        He would answer whatever was asked!
         Many of the things Li Hao had asked were actually confidential, and this guy had told him everything. If he were hou Xiaochen, he wouldn't say a word to someone like Wang Ming and forbid him from speaking!  This guy even told Li Hao about the origin divine weapon. He was only missing the details. Otherwise, Li Hao believed that he would tell him even if Li Hao asked.
        ……
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao and Wang Ming parted ways.
        Wang Ming looked back at Li Hao, who had entered the basement, and curled his lips. He suddenly laughed."Do you think I'm stupid? good fellow, it's possible that he's entered the middle stage of the 100th level. How terrifying!"
        He was proud of himself!
        I'm definitely right. Li Hao is still trying to hide things from me.
        So fast!
        Not long after, they met Li Meng on the way. Wang Ming sighed with emotion."Li Meng, work hard. If you don't enter the Half Moon tier soon, Li Hao will surpass you. He seems to have broken through to the middle stage of the 100-man cultivation realm!"
        Li Meng's heart tightened. So fast?
        The bun she had just bought didn't even smell as good anymore.
        Before long, the news that Li Hao might have broken through the middle-stage of the 100-point realm spread among the group of three in white moon City. Hu Hao also learned about it, and he was very nervous.
        Li Hao's guess was right. If Wang Ming felt that he was a good person, he would dare to say so.
        Even if it was just a guess, he dared to say it.
        ……
        At the same time.
        In the basement.
        Liu Long took a deep breath and looked at Li Hao.""I feel that you're almost there! Today, I will be different from before. Today, I will mainly use force! I only used force for a while before, and I didn't really use my divine decree to suppress you. However, you're still lacking that final step ... Your recovery ability is abnormal, so even if I hurt you, I'm not too worried. "
        In the past few days, he had also discovered Li Hao's perverseness.
        Since that was the case, he felt that he should give Li Hao more stimulation.
        He would even let Li Hao experience what real life and death were.
        Yuan Shuo was right, Liu Long sometimes really dared to make a move.
         Li Hao didn't care and nodded,"boss, come on. I also want to see the true strength of Qian combat!" After all, I might encounter powerhouses at the thousand-man level or the sunlit level at any time after I reach perfection. It'll be good for me to know how to deal with them in the future if I can feel them going all out in advance ..."
        "Alright!"
        Li Hao instantly felt his heart sink.
        His body was instantly pressed down!
        At this moment, Liu Long truly did not hold back.
        Except that he had not used the ninth refinement force.
        Without nine-fold, if he used it, it would not be an ordinary warrior power, but the strongest attack he thought could break through the three-sun defense.
        The divine intent was revealed!
        At this moment, a Small Axe appeared in Liu Long's hand. He cut through the thorns and instantly split Li Hao's Earth Force.
        A few days ago, when they fought, Liu Long's fist was injured several times. Later, the two of them decided that it was better to use weapons.
       
        At this moment, he struck out with his axe.
        With a bang, the earth seemed to split open.
        At this moment, Li Hao truly felt the power of a Qian warrior.
        He roared and stomped the ground again.
        Boom! Boom! Boom!
        The basement was shaking. The ground had already cracked open. At this moment, it had collapsed a little.
        Stomping his foot, Li Hao held the longsword that Yuan Shuo had given him. Although it wasn't an extraordinary item, it was still much more powerful than the ordinary longswords he had used before.
        Li Hao slashed his sword!
        The sword and the axe collided!
        With a bang, this time, they were no longer evenly matched. Li Hao felt a huge force oppressing him. In an instant, the long sword was knocked away by the giant axe.
         The web between his thumb and forefinger split open.
        Li Hao didn't even come back to his senses before the axe hacked down toward his head.
        Li Hao retreated in a hurry, but he once again felt that he was surrounded by huge waves, which seemed to have locked him down.
        Liu Long's axe had already descended.
        Li Hao quickly turned his head and bent his back, but he still couldn't block it. With a plop, the sharp axe directly cut his shoulder blade. The sharp pain made Li Hao feel that his entire right arm no longer belonged to him.
        A hint of hesitation appeared in Liu Long's eyes, but it quickly disappeared.
        Li Hao could do it!
        His injuries weren't light, but Li Hao could be healed. A few days ago, he had accidentally broken a few of Li Hao's bones, and Li Hao had quickly recovered.
        This time, although it was heavier, he believed that Li Hao would be fine.
        It was just that ... This kind of sparring was probably something that others would find hard to imagine.
        He exerted more force with his axe, giving off the feeling that he really wanted to kill Li Hao.
        In reality, Liu Long had not held back much.
        The stimulation of life and death ... This was exciting enough, wasn't it?
        "Ah!"
        Li Hao roared in pain.
        Right at this moment, his left hand reached out to grab the Small Axe. Liu Long pulled out the axe and chopped at his left hand.
        Li Hao would definitely be defeated this time!
        He didn't even have the strength to fight back, because the two of them were too close, Liu Long completely suppressed him.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, Li Hao didn't take back his left hand when he swung his axe.
        This caused Liu Long to be slightly shocked. It would break!
        Just as he was thinking about it, his hair stood on end. At this moment, a third hand suddenly appeared at his crotch. Moreover, that hand was mixed with a wisp of sword Qi.
        "Boss, be careful!"
        Before Li Hao could finish his sentence, his hand had already reached out.
        Magical hands!
        You cut mine first, so I won't be polite either.
        Liu Long felt the chill and was somewhat surprised. A third hand?
        How did he do it?
         He didn't realize that Li Hao's left hand had been fake.  He had fought Li Hao in close combat many times, but he had never discovered where Li Hao's third hand was.
        Or was he always wearing a prosthetic limb on his left hand?
        Then, these artificial limbs were too real.
        Liu Long rapidly retreated, but even so, he still felt a sharp pain. The sword intent had even torn his pants apart.
        Liu Long hurriedly took a few steps back and steadied himself.
        But Li Hao didn't care about this at all. The sword energy circulated in his body once, relieving him of much of the pain. He swung his sword again, and this time, it was even more powerful than before!
        The sword essence exploded!
        Without a sound, the sword stabbed out.
        With a clang, the small hatchet was directly pierced through.
        Liu Long's throat was directly exposed!
        At this moment, there were actually people watching the battle behind the two.
        Liu Yan and Yun Yao watched silently and broke into a cold sweat. The sparring between the two didn't look like a sparring at all. It was a life-and-death battle between life-and-death rivals.
        Every move was aimed at the vital points!
        It had been like this for the past few days, but it felt even more dangerous today.
        Liu Yan and Liu Yan didn't say a word and just watched the battle.
        They didn't even discuss anything.
        It would be disrespectful to the two of them if they were to discuss a sparring match. Even if they wanted to conclude, they should wait until after the battle to conclude the gains and losses.
        The two of them felt that they had benefited a lot.
        They were all martial masters. Even yunyao was a senior Martial Master of the tenth realm before entering Dark Moon. Naturally, she understood the danger and horror.
        They couldn't come to this kind of sparring.
        If they were really like Li Hao, they would have been crippled a long time ago, unable to recover at all.
        At this moment, Liu Yan opened her mouth and wanted to cry out in shock, but she forcefully suppressed it.
        In the distance, Liu Long suddenly gave up on his axe and threw it directly at Li Hao, breaking through Li Hao's sword intent. The next moment, he suddenly punched out, and with a boom, the sound of Li Hao's sternum breaking could be heard.
        He was sent flying by a punch.
        Liu Long closed in step by step. Even though Li Hao was sent flying, he didn't give Li Hao a chance. He quickly closed in and threw another punch!
        Like a human skin drum, Li Hao was hit by this punch until he vomited blood.
         Her eyes were a little dazed ...
        In the past few days, he had thought that the gap between him and Liu Long was not that big. However, today, Liu Long's punches, combined with his Shi, had completely suppressed him, leaving him with almost no strength to fight back.
        Even if he tried to sneak attack, he was dodged instantly.
        At this moment, Liu Long was closing in on him. Without stopping, Li Hao felt that he was going to die from a single punch.
        He was really going to die!
        Blood spurted out, and Li Hao fell to the ground. Liu Long stomped his foot mercilessly!
        He hoped to stimulate Li Hao's potential ... But now, it seemed that he had hit Li Hao too hard, so hard that Li Hao couldn't fight back at all. If this continued ... Today's battle could be over.
        At this moment, Li Hao's eyes suddenly widened!
        Those eyes were full of sword intent!
        He had been thinking about that sword strike ... He had been thinking about that sword strike that had severed the heavens and earth.
       
        However, now that he thought about it again, he suddenly felt that perhaps ... That sword should be more concerned about cutting off longevity and himself!
        He had cut off his own path to immortality just for that one sword strike!
        There was no return, and one sword ruled the world. Either the enemy died, or he died.
        That kind of sword was not conservative or reserved.
        Instead, each sword was the last sword of his life!
        At this moment, at this critical juncture, he seemed to have understood something. It was as if he had a weak resonance with that sword.
        The expert who had attacked with that sword had definitely not considered surviving when he attacked.
        He only had one thought, kill the enemy!
        The moment Liu Long's foot landed, Li Hao clearly realized that he had made a mistake.
        To that person, breaking the heavens and breaking the earth was just a slogan. The real core was to break me, break my path of survival, and die with the enemy!
         When the sword was drawn, blood would be seen. If it was not his, it would be the enemy 's!
        "Ha!"
        An angry roar sounded like a tiger's roar.
        The earth trembled!
        A protective layer seemed to have appeared in front of Li Hao. It was the earth Force, which instantly blocked Liu Long's path and stopped his feet.
        At this moment, Li Hao waved his palm!
        His palm was like a sword!
        This sword would not stop until one of them died!
        In an instant, a murderous aura filled the entire basement.
        Even Liu Yan and the other man, who were hiding behind, felt a chill at this moment. The chill made their scalps numb.
        Li Hao's palm cracked. He couldn't bear it.
        But he didn't care!
        Either you die, or I die!
        "Kill!"
        Bang! Bang!
        With a loud sound, the sword slashed out and directly cut Liu Long's leg, breaking the bones.
        Liu Long quickly retreated, his eyes filled with shock.
        The killing intent of this sword was so strong!
        There was even a crazy feeling of dying together!
        Liu Long endured the intense pain in his leg and threw a punch. Li Hao didn't Dodge, and his sword never returned!
        If you don't kill the enemy, you don't kill me!
        His left hand slammed on the ground and pushed himself up, while his right hand turned into a sword and slashed out again.
        Bang! Bang!
        Another deafening sound reverberated. Liu Long's huge wave was directly cut apart by this sword. Li Hao used his hand as a sword and instantly slashed down. With a pfft, he cut Liu Long's fist, and blood spurted out.
        As for Li Hao, he still didn't change his mind and aimed his palm at Liu Long's head!
        Liu Long roared, and the huge waves rolled again.
        The next moment, he roared again and again. The waves on his body stacked up one after another. At this time, he actually felt that his life was in danger. He could no longer bear it and no longer suppressed it. The ninth-refinement force burst out.
        BOOM!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The powerful ninth-refinement force hit Li Hao in an instant, directly deforming, twisting, and even breaking his palm.
        He lifted his foot and kicked Li Hao away.
        As for Liu Long, this time, he didn't chase after them. Instead, he touched his own throat ... It was actually covered in blood!
        His throat was slightly cut open.
        It was Li Hao's sword intent!
        Liu Long's eyes were complicated. He looked at himself and suddenly felt a little sad.
        Today was another day of injuries.
        His throat was broken, his hands were about to break, and his legs were about to break ...
        ? Even if it was a warrior with a thousand moves, he shouldn't be doing this!  Li Hao, who was on the ground, couldn't get up for a long time.
        If the enemy didn't die, then he should die.
        Fortunately, Liu Long's intention was not to kill him.
        Thus, after a full seven to eight minutes, Li Hao slowly got up, his face deathly pale. Even if the sword could be repaired, he was still seriously injured this time.
        "Boss ..."
        Li Hao looked at Liu Long and suddenly laughed,""I ... It seems like I can use my sword at will now!"
        Liu Long nodded slightly,"you've already integrated your inner strength into one. I'm even more curious. How did you manage to achieve such a sudden outburst just now?" Did you think of something?"
        "Cut me off!" Li Hao nodded.
        Cut me off?
        Liu Long mulled over the meaning of these words and suddenly frowned,"This swordsmanship, this swordsmanship, is too brutal! At first, I thought that it was just exquisite and that its killing intent was too strong, but your comprehension just now clearly said that this is a sword that will see blood when it is used!"
        If it wasn't the enemy 's, it was his.
        This was not created by Yuan Shuo!
        At this moment, he understood and said in a deep voice,""The creator of this sword must have been a crazy swordsman! If he didn't kill the enemy, he would cut himself off! They're killing for the sake of killing ..."
        "Teacher said that the moment martial arts and superpowers appear, it's for killing!"
        Li Hao smiled."I feel that this sword ... Is very suitable."
        "You ..."
        Liu Long wanted to say something, but in the end, he just sighed and didn't say anything.
        Yes, be it martial arts or superpowers, the goal was to kill.
        However, there were also those who defended, retreated, and escaped ...
        On the other hand, Li Hao's sword attack was really just for killing. There was no other way to defend or defend.
        "However, he's very strong!"
        "If I didn't use the ninth refinement force, you might have really cut my throat!" Liu Long said with great confidence.
        He had used all his force, but he had almost been killed by Li Hao.
        Li Hao smiled shyly, a little embarrassed.
        Liu Long's face darkened.
        Don't f * cking smile like that, it's so disgusting, bah!
        "Boss's injuries are not light this time. I have already completed the integration of sword intent, so there is no need for us to spar anymore. Boss, come back with me to my teacher's place and let him treat you so that there won't be any residual effects!"
        Liu Long rolled his eyes.
        Your teacher?
        Come on!
        It had been a few days. He was not out of his mind. He already knew that the energy he needed for his advancement last time might have come from Li Hao.
        Li Hao's fast recovery might have something to do with the sword he had always carried with him.
        At this point, how could he not understand?
        Of course, he did not expose her.
        Knowing it was one thing, but there was no need to say it out loud to show that he was smarter than others.
        "Inner strength transforming into a sword, sword intent merging into one ... Li Hao, you're amazing!"
         At this moment, Liu Long once again praised,""If it was 20 years ago, you would have been able to get a title like Sword King in the Silver Moon martial forest! Back then, my father was one of the Silvermoon's three Spears, and your teacher was the king of the five birds. Your current achievements can even be compared to them back then ..."
        It was truly unbelievable.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, shook his head and said,"far from it!" Boss, reputation is built through fighting, not by reaching a certain realm. "
        He knew that he was still a step behind his teacher and the others.
        What was lacking?
        A true massacre!
        His teacher and the others had fought their way up step by step, while he had just started from a higher point.
        And the next trip to the ruins might be the time for him to truly grow.
        However, Li Hao had completed all the training required to break through stage 100 after integrating his internal strength. Next, he could prepare to step into the universe of fighters.
        [Author's note: my back hurts again. I really can't take it anymore. Today happens to be the weekend, so I'll release one chapter. In order to write for a longer period of time in the future, I might release one chapter every weekend. Sorry, I had the same idea in the previous book. I'll try this book and give myself some time to adjust.]
       
        Li Hao finally felt the power of breaking through the 100-level barrier after he had truly integrated his inner strength into one.
        This was the true completion of breaking through 100.
        ? Back at the mine, although he had also broken through 100 perfection, the difference was obvious compared to today.
        The most obvious point was that he could exert his strength in one place.
        He gathered all the strength in his body and attacked wherever he pointed.
        This was probably the biggest feature of someone who had broken through 100%.
        ……
        After entering the perfection stage, Li Hao no longer sparred with Liu Long.
        He brought Liu Long to his teacher's place and treated the injuries that had accumulated over the past few days. Liu Long thanked Yuan Shuo as usual, but his eyes were fixed on Li Hao.
        This kid really knows how to act!
         Li Hao didn't mind. He would pretend one day at a time, and when he couldn't pretend anymore, he would stop.
        As long as I'm not embarrassed, you're the one who's embarrassed. You're all too embarrassed to expose me.
        ……
        Time continued to pass, never stopping for anyone.
        In the blink of an eye, it was mid-August.
        The strength of the entire Blizzard Silver city's Nightwalker team was improving every day. The harvest from killing so many powerhouses last time was slowly being digested by everyone.
        A single harvest could be compared to the gains of the demon hunting squad over the years.
        Everyone was improving rapidly.
        Liu Yan had finally broken through to the middle stage of the 100 + level. Although Wu Chao and Chen Jian did not advance any further and entered the middle stage, they were not far away from the middle stage.
        The improvement of superpowers was actually faster.
        At the Dark Moon stage, as long as you have enough mystic energy, you can improve quickly. If you find the third superpower lock and unlock it, you have enough mystic energy and can even step into the glorious sun Stage.
        Therefore, Li Meng and the others had also improved.
        The ones who improved the fastest were not Li Meng or Hu Hao. These two had special abilities, so they did not have the matching mysterious energy. They could only absorb some attribute-less mysterious energy to strengthen themselves. Hu Hao was better off, as he could absorb some wind energy to strengthen himself.
        As for Li Meng ... She was now interested in martial arts and put all her energy into it, which led to her only reaching the peak of the crescent moon from the early stage.
        He hadn't even reached the half-moon level.
        The one who improved the fastest was actually yunyao. She was a Water-type superhuman and had originally been at the peak of the ten decapitation realm. She had entered as a Martial Master, so her body was strong and her inner strength was also transforming. Therefore, during this period of time, she had entered the ten decapitation realm faster than Li Meng.
        Hu Hao was originally at the peak of the waning moon stage, but now, he had also stepped into the Half Moon stage.
        There was also Wang Ming. This guy's conversion efficiency was very fast. Although he had just entered the full moon, he had also entered the full moon level on the 15th of September after frantically absorbing the mysterious energy.
        At this point, it was time for him to make preparations for sunlight.
        This was something he had not expected before he came to the Silver City.
        He had thought that it would be good if he could improve in half a year after coming to the Silver City. He had not expected that he would step into the full moon stage in less than a month.  He had made progress in both of his visits to Silver City. At this moment, he even felt that Silver City was his blessed land.
        ……
        Everyone had made progress, big or small.
        The last time they dealt with the Qiao family, they fattened up the entire Silver city's night patrol.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, had been studying his small sword for the past few days since he had broken through 100.
        Not only that, he also sought guidance from his teacher on some sword arts.
        That sword of his had cut him off.
        Unless it was the last moment, it was best not to use that move. In that case, Li Hao hoped to learn some basic sword techniques.
        The five birds technique mainly focused on fists, claws, and feet, and didn't involve weapons.
        Yuan Shuo was not good at swordsmanship.
        However, he would.
        He had dabbled in a wide range of things, and there was almost nothing he did not know.
        In the yuan family's courtyard.
        Hearing Li Hao's request, Yuan Shuo thought for a moment, then said,""Back then, Silvermoon had Seven Swordsmen, and they became famous throughout the entire city. I don't know how many are left, but most of them are dead. "
        "One of them is called shadow swordsman! With the Shadowless Sword in his hand, he became famous in the martial arts world! The sword strikes without sound, like a shadow following the body, with bizarreness, Yin, and poison as the core, and another point, fast!"
        Yuan Shuo thought for a while and said,"this person was also in the completion of breaking through 100 years ago. He comprehended the shadow Force. When he attacked, it was as if the night had fallen. The night covered everything about the sword, allowing him to often gain the upper hand in battle."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Shadowless Sword!
        Li Hao was full of interest and said,"teacher, I call that sword of mine the" breaking my sword "!" The main points of the self-severing sword were speed, ruthlessness, and sharpness, but it was more for killing enemies head-on! If I can use the Shadowless Sword, everyone will think that I'm good at light and strange sword techniques. I think many people won't be able to react in time if I catch him off guard and kill him with one strike. "
        Simply put, he wanted to learn.
        Yuan Shuo smiled and nodded,"if you want to learn, I can teach you!" I have both the sword moves and the breathing technique of the Shadowless Sword. "
         Why?
        Li Hao glanced at his teacher. After a while, he said,""Teacher, Seven Swordsmen, how many did you kill?"
        “……”
        Yuan Shuo glared at him. He was speaking as if he was a devil.
        "What do you mean by killing a few? I didn't even kill half of them. I killed three of the seven Swordsmen. If the rest die, it has nothing to do with me!"
        I knew it!
        Li Hao was a little curious. This time, he couldn't hold back."Teacher, you've killed so many people, yet no one has formed a group to take revenge on you?"
        It really wasn't easy to live to this day!
        "You really care a lot!"
        Yuan Shuo glared at him. The little guy is now interested in his past. Can I tell you?
       
        Some of the past events were not too glorious.
        He avoided the topic and muttered to himself,""If you learn Shadowless Sword, you'll know three secret skills. For the path of a Martial Master, it's best to have one secret skill from beginning to end!"
        Why so?
        Li Hao understood that the key lay in the breathing technique.
        This was the disadvantage of being a Martial Master. They had one secret technique and one breathing technique. Every time they changed to another secret technique, they had to change their breathing technique. If they were not careful, it was easy to make mistakes in the process and the enemy could seize the opportunity.
        Therefore, even someone as strong as Yuan Shuo was not omnipotent. He was not good at using weapons. Now that he had the stone saber in his hand, he only used it as a claw or a fist, and did not really use it as a saber technique.
        A Martial master's Secret technique would never be out of date.
        The stronger you are, the stronger your secret art will be.
        Therefore, one secret technique was usually enough. Back then, the Silvermoon martial arts school was also famous for its experts who focused on one thing.
        He was skilled in sword, staff, fist, and spear techniques. All of them had their own unique characteristics.
         Although Yuan Shuo hoped that his students could become stronger, he still reminded them,""Everyone hopes to be an all-rounded Martial Master. However, there are too many of them, and they are not skilled. This is often a huge problem!"
        "This is especially so when it comes to switching breathing techniques. Many a time, some powerhouses actually die at this very moment. Switching breathing techniques is when the chances of a Martial Master dying are the highest!"
        A Martial Master who was good at seizing opportunities could easily capture this moment of stagnation.
        Li Hao nodded."I understand. Teacher, when you first learned the five birds technique, it was also separated at the beginning. Later, didn't you also fuse the five birds and integrate them with a breathing technique?"
        This was also Yuan Shuo's greatest success in his life!
        Yuan Shuo, however, frowned slightly and only spoke after a long while,""First, the five birds have something in common! Second, I didn't create the five birds technique out of thin air. It's recorded in ancient books that I didn't build a tall building from flat ground, but stood on ruins and built a tall building from a base. "
        He looked at Li Hao."If you want me to create the breathing technique of five birds out of thin air, I won't have the confidence to do it, even though I don't think I'm weaker than anyone."
        He warned Li Hao not to aim too high!
        Even he, a knowledgeable person who knew everything from ancient to modern times, didn't dare to say that he could combine the nine refined force, Shadowless Sword, and five birds technique to create a breathing technique and integrate them.
        Li Hao didn't say anything.
        However, he still had to learn the sword technique.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yuan Shuo merely reminded him. He knew that Li Hao wouldn't give up. Besides, it was only right for Li Hao to learn the sword.
        "Think about it, then I'll pass you the Shadowless Sword today!"
        Yuan Shuo stood up and raised his hand. A long sword fell into his hand from the weapon rack in the courtyard.
        As a Grandmaster-level Martial Master, even if he wasn't good at sword techniques, he felt more imposing than Li Hao when he held the sword.
        The next moment, he brandished his sword.
         Li Hao's eyes were fixed on him. He knew that his teacher was giving him a demonstration, so he watched very seriously.  The long sword was like a shadow as it streaked through the air.
        Even during the day, they could only see streaks of light. There was no sound, and it was very quiet.
        Fast and concealed.
        This was the characteristic of Shadowless Sword. It was very, very fast, and the sound of it breaking through the air seemed to be blocked by a breathing technique. As Yuan Shuo breathed, it was as if the air in front of him had been sucked out, placing the sword in a vacuum environment.
        In this way, the sword would be more ethereal, and the sword would be silent.
        It was a very special sword technique!
        Sensing all this, Li Hao thought that if he could apply this technique to other secret Arts, his sword and fist would be soundless, which would be extraordinary.
        Vacuum ...
        The vacuum wasn't completely soundless, but it was able to eliminate sound to the maximum. To assassins and killers, this was simply a Unique Cultivation Technique.
        This Shadowless Sword had actually been killed by his teacher back then.
        Yuan Shuo stabbed dozens of times in a row. Judging from the trajectory of Li Hao's sword, it was also a vicious sword technique that aimed at vital points.
        A moment later, Yuan Shuo sheathed his sword and exhaled!
        This breath was like a thunderclap.
        A ray of white light shot out, causing the air to explode.
        "The last move of Shadowless Sword is not on the sword, but on the exhaling sword!"
         "Under normal circumstances, everyone will only be concerned about your sword," Yuan Shuo said solemnly."The moment you Put away your sword, everyone will think that you're going to change your cultivation technique or surrender ... They don't know that the last sword is the most dangerous! The shadowless breathing technique had been constantly devouring the surrounding air and converting it into energy. At the last moment, it would be spat out, and the destructive power of the sword from the mouth was even greater than the Shadowless Sword from before! This is the true core of the Shadowless Sword!"
        Li Hao nodded.
        "This sword almost killed me back then ..." Yuan Shuo continued.
        He wasn't afraid to expose his weakness."When I saw him withdraw his sword to defend, I thought he couldn't fight anymore. Just as I was about to approach him and finish him off with one move, he suddenly spat out his sword and almost shattered my heart with one strike!"
        He still reminisced about the battle with Shadowless Sword.
        That time, he was almost killed.
        During the fight, he had always had the upper hand. From this, it could be seen that in a battle, the stronger one would not survive. If he had been slightly careless, he would have died at that time. Fortunately, he had shifted slightly and avoided his heart.
        Li Hao revealed a smile."Even teacher fell for it. This means that it's indeed very powerful. However ... All the old people of Silver Moon martial forest know about it, right?"
        "I don't know,"
        Yuan Shuo shook his head,"if the last move of Shadowless Sword is known by others, it won't be a secret move anymore!" Whoever had fought with Shadowless Sword had either died from this last move or ... Shadowless Sword had died! Anyone who was almost killed by his last sword attack, even if they didn't want to kill him, they had to kill him! Unless he can kill his opponent, he will die!"
       
        So, he really died.
        He died at the hands of Yuan Shuo.
        "That's even better!"Li Hao was delighted.
        He also liked this secret technique. Like the magical hand rejuvenation, it was a wonderful sneak attack. Together with the sword in his mind, Li Hao felt that he had many more trump cards.
        This was the benefit of having a powerful teacher. He could do everything, and any secret technique he used was something that other martial masters could only dream of.
        Next, Yuan Shuo began to teach him the Shadowless Sword breathing technique, which was the foundation.
        Laws were the foundation.
        Then, there were the techniques. These were techniques. On the outside, techniques were not static. The battle situation was different, the situation was different, and even the people he met were different. Techniques could be changed, and there was no need to be fixed.
        Just like the five birds technique, when a fierce tiger hunts, it also depends on the type, number, and strength of the prey. It doesn't always kill the prey with a single claw.
        Li Hao was very serious.
         He had a good memory. Even though he couldn't remember everything that his teacher had told him, he could at least remember 70% of it. As for the rest, he would be able to remember it all after his teacher repeated it twice.
        Then, Li Hao began to slowly try.
        The key was in the adjustment of the breathing technique. Breathing techniques were used in conjunction with moves. Using other breathing techniques could easily hurt oneself.
        ……
        Li Hao began his next round of training.
        At the same time.
        White moon City.
        Hao lianchuan was also ready to leave.
        The exploration of the ruins was set for August 28th. There were still more than 10 days before the exploration began.
        However, he needed to rush there in advance to do some preparation work.
        In addition, he had to make a trip to Silver City, mainly to pick up Yuan Shuo and hand over the last Sunblaze Blood God in the warehouse to Wang Ming. Wang Ming had someone help him apply for it, which had cost him a full 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
        And the Wang family was the one who paid for the mysterious energy.
        Wang Ming's promise to the Wang family was that as long as he got the blood God, he would have a hundred percent chance of making a monthly profit, and there would also be a thirty percent chance of sunlight ...
        This time, Wang Ming was smart for once. He was afraid that his family wouldn't be willing to fork out the money because of the huge expenses.
        He had already entered full moon, but he did not reveal it. It was rare for him to be able to hold it in, mainly because the distance was too far, and communication was inconvenient, so he could hold it in.
        Therefore, even if he did not enter sunlit, he was not afraid.
        Since he was already at full moon and did not enter riyao, he could at least answer to his family. Although a rich man like him did not lack money, he could not waste it as he wished, especially when it involved such a huge amount of 200 cubic meters.
        This time, Hao lianchuan was not alone.
         In the lobby on the first floor of the Nightwalker headquarters.  This time, Hao lianchuan had brought a total of 20 people, all of whom were powerhouses. There were at least five or six people from Dark Moon, and he himself, the three suns. For the sake of this relic exploration, the night patrollers had been fully mobilized.
        Other than some of the sunlight that could not be used, the Nightwatchers had used all the sunlight they could in Silver Moon.
        In addition to Huang Yun, who was in charge there, a total of seven sunlit cultivators were dispatched this time.
        In addition, Yuan Shuo was an expert who could kill three suns. If Liu Long also entered the thousand warrior tier ... It could be said that he had nearly half the strength of a night patroller.
        Hao lianchuan was waiting.
        The others were also waiting.
        After a while, someone came down from upstairs.
        Hou Xiaochen's face was calm as he walked over. He didn't Walk Like a Dragon or a Tiger, but instead looked very relaxed. This caused everyone's nervous heart to relax a bit.
        "Minister!"
        Everyone started to speak.
        Some of the younger Nightwatchers were better off, as they could only feel the majesty.
        However, some of the older night patrollers were a little fanatical.
        The older he was, the calmer he was.
        At this moment, the situation was reversed.
        This was because hou Xiaochen hadn't fought in many years, but the older night patrolmen had seen his power in action. Many years ago, Red Moon had attacked and forced Yuan Shuo to show up. She had also forced Silver Moon to not meddle in other people's business and only kill Yuan Shuo. If the night patrolmen had dared to interfere, they had immediately killed them.
        But that time, hou Xiaochen came out with his spear and killed a top-tier master. That day, the three suns died, many years before Yuan Shuo killed them.
        Not only that, in that battle, hou Xiaochen didn't just kill one of the three suns. Riyao also killed many of them, and even Ying Hongyue was drawn out in the end.
         Facing Ying Hongyue, hou Xiaochen didn't even take a step back.
        However, it was a good thing that a top-notch expert came from the central region that day. The night patrolmen were in the headquarters in the central region. At that time, several experts came to help in the battle, which made Ying Hongyue retreat.
        Even though hou Xiaochen hadn't fought Ying Hongyue, in everyone's eyes, he was already a legendary figure who was able to withstand Ying Hongyue's pressure and not fear her.
        The more outstanding Ying Hongyue's battle achievements were in the central continent, the more it proved hou Xiaochen's power.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com p Hou Xiaochen didn't care about everyone's expressions, nor did he speak in a dignified manner. He was calm and gentle as he spoke,"This time, I wish everyone all the best. It'll be best if you succeed, but if you don 't, your life is your priority. "  "When you go to the remains, pay attention to Yuan Shuo's words, but don't get too close to him."
        "He's offended too many people,"hou Xiaochen laughed." There might be some powerful people coming to kill him this time, so his words are professional and can be listened to. " It'll be dangerous if we get too close!"
        Although his words were filled with danger, everyone couldn't help but laugh.
        They were obedient, but they had to stay away from the devil. Everyone understood this.
        "Minister kui has a calm personality. Although he's a fire element expert, he's not as violent as the fire element. This is what I value. People who can restrain themselves are often people who can succeed!"
       
        Hao lianchuan smiled, feeling very comfortable after being praised.
        "But your department head Hao sometimes thinks too much ..."
        Hou Xiaochen smiled,"this time, a total of seven people from riyao will be participating. Including Yuan Shuo and Hao lianchuan, there will be nine in total." "If there's a conflict with the three major organizations, your department head Hao might hesitate ... At that time, as long as the five of them agree to start a war, there's no need to report it to the headquarters, and the war will start immediately! If there are less than 9 people and more than half agree, then we'll start the war!"
        Hao lianchuan wanted to say something but stopped.
        "I'm not trying to lower your authority,"hou Xiaochen replied,"it's just that I'm well aware of your shortcomings. Everyone here understands what you're saying and will listen to you. However, it's better to have a backup plan!"
        Hao lianchuan nodded and said with a bit of dejection,""Now that the Minister said that, it's like I'm afraid of the three major organizations!"
        "I'm not afraid,"hou Xiaochen laughed,"I'm just overthinking things. You're always worried that if we fight them, the losses will be too great, and the night patrollers won't be able to keep a foothold in Silvermoon ... Let's put it this way. I'm still alive on the night patrollers" side, but the Silvermoon night patrollers won't be able to be killed any time soon. You can relax. "
        Hao lianchuan nodded. He was indeed overthinking.
        As Silver moon's second Sun, hou Xiaochen rarely went out. He was mainly in charge of all kinds of trivial matters. He had watched many people grow up, so he couldn't bear to watch them die.
        "That's all I have to say ... If we succeed this time, Silver Moon will be impregnable!"
         Hou Xiaochen let out a light breath and waved his hand,"Go! I hope that no matter how many people go today, how many people will come back in a few days. "
        "Minister, I'll definitely bring everyone back!" Hao lianchuan said seriously.
        "Let's go!"He shouted.
        The group of more than 20 people quickly left and returned to their original positions.
        In the main hall, hou Xiaochen watched silently.
        However many people went, how many people would come back?
        It was almost impossible!
        He knew it, Hao lianchuan knew it, and everyone who didn't go knew it.
        It was impossible.
        This was not the first time they had explored the cross-section Canyon ruins. The previous few times, without the presence of the large organizations, they had already lost a lot of people. Not to mention that this time, the three large organizations and some small and medium-sized organizations had also participated.
        It would be considered lucky if 70% of them returned.
        ……
        August 20th.
        The sky was clear.
        After 20 days of bitter cultivation and crazy absorption, the strength of the entire Silver city's Nightwatchers had improved.
        Li Hao also stopped cultivating Shadowless Sword.
        There was a letter from the higher-ups, and Minister Xi had come again today.
        The blizzard Silver city's Nightwatchers were all very familiar with this Third Sun, and they had come several times in a short time.
        At the law enforcement building.
        Hao lianchuan's eyes were slightly strange. It was not easy for him to notice the improvement of a Martial Master.
        However, he could feel the improvement of his powers.
        Wang Ming had actually entered full moon!
        Yunyao and Hu Hao had also entered the half-moon level. Even Li Meng, although not able to enter the half-moon level, felt like he was only one step away.
         This was beyond his expectations.  His improvement was too fast!
        According to his calculations, it would take at least half a year for them to achieve such results. In the end, they had succeeded so quickly.
        It was obvious that these people had gained a lot from the last battle.
        The mysterious energy he obtained might also exceed his expectations.
        Liu Long said that he had killed a few Yue Ming ... Was he really just a Yue Ming?
        Such doubts flashed in his mind, but he quickly suppressed them. These were not the key. It was a good thing to improve.
        Soon after Li Hao entered, Liu Long also arrived.
        The 9 night patrollers all gathered.
        Hao lianchuan had taken the time to come here. He didn't have much time, so he didn't waste time."Chief Liu, I told you before that we're going to explore the ruins in the transverse Canyon soon. You said you'd consider it, have you made your decision?"
        "Go!"
        "But, I'm not the only one who wants to go, I'm going to bring some people with me!"
        Hao lianchuan frowned."It's dangerous. I'm not joking!" This time, the night watchers are mostly at the Dark Moon, full moon, or even full moon level. However, there will be a small number of Starlight and dark Moon supers left outside. They will only be in charge of receiving and stopping ordinary people from passing by ..."
        This time, there were only a few who entered the ruins in half a month.
        Quality was more important than quantity.
        Liu Long said calmly,"Hao bu, we, the Silver City's night patrollers, have been on the battlefield for a long time. We have more experience!" Besides, I don't have many people to bring with me, just Liu Yan and Li Hao. Li Hao was actually brought by professor Yuan, so I'm fine with just Liu Yan. "
        Liu Yan?
        Hao lianchuan glanced at Liu Yan and frowned slightly. He also knew that Tiger soul had arrived.
        He was afraid that there would be a problem!
        "This ..."
        Liu Yan looked at Hao lianchuan and interrupted,""Hao bu, I'm not a superhuman. Even if I die, it won't affect the night patrollers much."
        "Not this!"
        "We're all night watchers," Hao lianchuan said in a deep voice."It doesn't matter who dies. No one can die!" However, you just broke through a hundred ..."
         "I've already broken through to the middle stage of the 100 + level!"
        Liu Yan said. Hao lianchuan was a little surprised, but he quickly understood. It was only the middle stage, so it wasn't too difficult.
        "Hao bu, I'm going too!" Wang Ming said in a hurry as he was thinking.
        "And me!"
        "I'll go too!"
        “……”
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, the silver Blizzard city's people began to speak.
        Hao lianchuan's face turned green and he was a little angry.""You guys also want to rebel?"
        They all said they wanted to go!
        What about the Silver City?
       
        Besides, was he going to die?
        Li Meng, who was at the peak of the waning moon stage, was a noob there, unless he was guarding outside the remains.
        "Hao bu, I'm Yueying!" Wang Ming hurriedly said. If everything goes well in the next few days, I'll be able to step into the sunlit realm ... With the combat power of a sunlit expert, I'll be a powerhouse anywhere, right? If I don't go, it would be such a waste!"
        Hao lianchuan looked at him in surprise. After a while, he said,""You can enter the glorious sun?"
        He didn't really believe it!
        Even if Wang Ming said that the clones of Blood God were useful to him, it wasn't as if superpowers had never absorbed them before. What the hell was the use? even if there was a little effect, it definitely couldn't compare to the effect of 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
        "It's no loss to try ... Hao bu, let me go too!"Wang Ming said embarrassedly.
        Hao lianchuan had indeed never thought that Wang Ming would be able to enter the full moon stage. After some consideration, he said,""It's not impossible for you to go ... It's fine for the young ones to temper themselves, but it's fine for the others!"
        To put it bluntly, he was too weak.
        If he went, he would really die!
         Relic exploration wasn't a sightseeing tour, and he didn't have the energy to take care of too many people.
        Chen Jian and the others were somewhat unwilling. They had also broken through the 100-point threshold, especially this time. It was said that they were going to take revenge ... Yes, to kill li Dahu!
        This, they also knew.
        The demon hunting squad's feelings for each other were still very deep. If they couldn't kill li Dahu this time, then how long would they have to wait?
        Chen Jian, who usually did not talk much, also stood up at this moment and said in a muffled voice,"Hao bu, I'm also a Martial Master with over a hundred martial masters! Martial masters were more concealed than superpowers! I'm also good at defense. Plus, the three major organizations must have a great understanding of the night patrollers, but they lack understanding of us ... I think we might be of some use if we go. "
        "Over a hundred?"
        Hao lianchuan was a little surprised. He looked at Wu Chao, who laughed and said in a soft voice,""I've also broken through 100!"
        Hao lianchuan was really surprised!
        In the small silver City, these people had actually entered the 100th level. This was a bit terrifying.
        Breaking through 100 was comparable to Yue Ming.
        Yue Ming wasn't too strong, but not everyone was Yue Ming, even among the night patrollers.
        However, at this moment, Liu Long opened his mouth,""Liu Yan, Wang Ming, and Li Hao will go. The others will stay behind!"
        He knew how dangerous it was, and he also knew what everyone was thinking.
        I can't let them all be wiped out in one go!
        Out of nine people, four were already a lot.
        Wang Ming smiled. On one hand, he wanted to go on an adventure, which might bring him some benefits.
        On one hand, he knew how powerful Liu Long and Yuan Shuo were. He felt that if Li Hao wasn't afraid of death, he wouldn't be afraid either. He might even get some unexpected gains.
        Moreover, this might also be his chance to make a name for himself!
        If the night patrolman wanted to be famous, he had to fight his way out!
        This time, if he could enter sunlit and kill one of them, he would be able to make a name for himself in the field of supers. He was still young, only 20 years old. To be able to kill sunlit at 20, he, Wang Ming, would be considered an expert in Silver Moon!
        "Boss!"
        Wu Chao and the others were a little unwilling.
        They also wanted to go, as demon hunting squads always worked together.
        "Cultivate well!" Liu Long said in a deep voice. You'd better have improved while we were gone. I'll come back and test you. If you want to fight, if you want to kill, there will be plenty of opportunities. After this exploration ends, we might even have to fight with the three major organizations. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future!"
        Hearing this, Hao lianchuan's expression changed slightly. These words ... Forget it, it was really possible.
        Hao lianchuan pondered for a moment. Of the four of them, Liu Long and Wang Ming were strong enough, and Yuan Shuo wanted to bring Li Hao along, so there was no problem.
        The key was Liu Yan ...
        Considering that she might want to take revenge and was eager to take revenge, he did not let her go. If she ran away secretly, it might be more troublesome and dangerous.
        After thinking for a while, Hao lianchuan nodded and said,"then the four of you!" "Originally, Li Meng and Hu Hao were supposed to protect professor Yuan, but now he has the strength to protect himself. In addition, the three major organizations might send more experts this time, and their strength is higher than expected. So, you don't have to go!"
        "Relic 28, officially entering! So if you're here before the 28th, I won't be coming to pick you up. "
        He still had matters to attend to over there. He had to figure out how many powerhouses the large organizations had sent this time.
        "Hao bu, I'll be there in time with my men!" Liu Long nodded.
        "Then I won't say more ..."
        With that, he threw a bottle to Wang Ming."Wang Ming, think about it before using it. It's not cheap, and it's mainly effective for martial masters. If you're not confident, then sell it to Liu Long!"
        With that, he quickly left, no longer staying.  ……
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After Hao lianchuan left, Chen Jian was a little unwilling.""Boss, why aren't you taking us there?"
        Liu Long frowned,"I don't have the final say!" This time, it's mainly white moon City. Also, do you think Silver City is very safe now? If they all leave, who will protect the Silver City?"
        "But!"
        "No buts!"
        Liu Long interrupted him and looked at the others,"This time, everyone should keep an eye on Silver City. Silver Moon might fall into chaos before we even get out of the ruins! In addition, a large number of experts have entered the ruins. Since old Yuan and I have left, we have to be careful of people sneaking into the Silver City. The Silver City is not safe. "
        Wang Ming had no interest in listening to their conversation.
        He hurriedly pulled Li Hao and said in a low voice,""Li Hao, I've got it. Do you think ... That ..."
        Seeing his eagerness, Li Hao chuckled. After some consideration, he nodded and said,""Alright, come to my teacher's house tonight. I'll help you absorb the blood God's spawn ..."
        "Give me the blood God first, I need to go back and prepare," he added.
        "Ah?"
        Give it to you?
        Wang Ming was a little worried. You wouldn't have pocketed it, right?
        Li Hao looked at him like this. After a long while, Wang Ming handed the blood God to him uneasily and said,"That ... Don't break it."
        Li Hao smiled and didn't bother to reply.
        He had his own considerations. Now that he had broken through 100, he didn't really need this Blood God anymore. What he needed to do now was to Master Force and step into the universe.
        However, the blood God's clones were more effective for martial masters.
        In fact, Li Hao wanted to give this Blood God's spawn to Liu Yan. It was very likely that she would reach the late-stage, or rather, it would be almost easy for her to reach the late-stage, but her Shi was not easy to control.
        It was still very dangerous for Liu Yan to go to the remains.
        As for Wang Ming, Li Hao's idea was to use sword energy to extract some metal-type mystic energy and combine it with sword energy for easy absorption and digestion. This might also help him enter the glorious sun State, and it might even be more effective than the blood God.
        A Scion of the blood God's ability to increase one's powers was not as powerful as one might imagine.
        For this, Li Hao had to pay a part of the mysterious metal energy and a lot of sword energy, which was a loss.
        But Li Hao didn't care.
        When he had joined the demon hunting squad, no one had excluded him, even if they had only treated him as bait. However, at the crucial moment, everyone had protected him. Even when Liu Yan was being chased by over a hundred people, she had still dragged him along.
        Li Hao remembered all of this.
        He didn't mind helping everyone if he could.
        If Wang Ming could enter the sunlight sect and Liu Yan could enter the late-stage of the 100th level, then this team from Silver City would be even more powerful and have more capital to protect themselves.
        After exchanging a few words with Wang Ming, Li Hao moved closer to Liu Yan and said in a low voice,"Sis, let's go to my teacher's place tonight ..."
        Liu Yan glanced at him and said, "You're not going to your house? Is it appropriate to go to your teacher's house?"
        “……”
        Li Hao pretended not to hear him and said in a low voice,""There are benefits!"
        Liu Yan pondered and said,""Don't you misappropriate Wang Ming's Blood God! Although that fellow is annoying and has a big mouth, I wouldn't dare to use a treasure exchanged for 200 cubic meters, even if you gave it to me!"
        She guessed that Li Hao was planning to take Wang Ming's things for himself.
        If that was the case, she could not accept it.
         Even if she wanted to advance, she wouldn't take the treasure of her teammate for herself.
        Li Hao was a little surprised. Was it that obvious?
        My character is this bad?
        Wang Ming suspected me, and Liu Yan actually guessed it at once?
        "No, don't worry. If you don't believe me, you can just watch. Unless Wang Ming advances, I won't pocket it!"
        So, you pocketed it just because you advanced?
        Liu Yan thought for a moment and laughed. If she really advanced, what would be left?
        Thinking of this, she didn't care anymore and nodded,""Alright, do you want to stay the night? How about I bring a change of undergarments? which one do you like?"
        “……”
        Li Hao turned around and left. Young women were really scary!
       
        Night.
        The yuan family.
        Hearing Li Hao's thoughts and arrangements, Yuan Shuo did not say anything. He only reminded,""Don't take Wang Ming for a fool. He's not a fool. The metal-type mysterious energy you extracted ... If I were to distinguish it from metal-type mysterious energy, it should be called metal elemental energy. "
        "The elemental energy you extract is pure and singular. It's impossible for a normal super to not understand the power of it ... Even if he doesn't know whether it's elemental energy or not, you'll be in big trouble if his mouth leaks it."
        There were many people who knew about the sword energy.
        If the matter of extracting elemental energy were to be leaked ... It would be even more troublesome.
        Li Hao sat cross-legged on the ground.
        Hearing this, he nodded slightly. He had already considered it and said,""I understand, but I know one thing, you don't have to worry about your debts! Now that the red moon knows a lot of things, the Yama might know something, and the night patrolmen might have guessed something ... In that case, what's the big deal about letting others know more?"
        Li Hao smiled."Actually, there are only two possibilities. First, Wang Ming is grateful and kept my secret. He'll help me in the future. Second, he was tempted and revealed it, which made him an enemy. "
        Would one more enemy matter?
         He didn't care.
        Weighing the pros and cons, the result was nothing more than this.
        And from their recent interactions, Wang Ming's character was alright except for his big mouth.
        If he had been told to keep it a secret, he might have done the same. For example, Wang Ming had never told anyone about the tenth person Li Hao had mentioned, but he had to warn them in advance.
        Yuan Shuo nodded.
        This student of his had his own thoughts as well, and Yuan Shuo would not usually stop him. He would only state the pros and cons clearly.
        "Up to you, but be prepared to face the consequences!"
        At this point, Yuan Shuo did not say anything more.
        The path was one's own.
        Even if he encountered some obstacles, it would be a good thing if he could truly understand the fearsomeness of the human heart.
        ……
        After a while, Wang Ming arrived first.
        When he saw Yuan Shuo, Wang Ming's face was full of smiles."Teacher!"
        An in-name disciple was still a disciple, and Yuan Shuo was so powerful. He had the intention to curry favor with him, but Yuan Shuo gave them a very dignified impression. Except for Li Hao, the others were a little timid when interacting with him.
        Yuan Shuo sized him up and said in a calm tone,""I originally didn't want to interfere too much. You're only an in-name disciple, so you should know very well why I took you in. Your little senior brother forced me to use my secret technique to help you level up ... It's actually a small matter, but if you level up too quickly and the news gets out ... You have to understand, what does it mean for a superpower to level up easily?"
        "Teacher, I understand, so I'm very grateful to Li Hao ..." Wang Ming's heart froze.
        "That's your senior brother!"
        Wang Ming was embarrassed. It wasn't good to shout, and he couldn 't.
        Yuan Shuo didn't say anything else and said in a deep voice,""I only have one request, keep your mouth shut! If I really did successfully advance, if the outside world asks ..."
        He thought about it for a while. If the outside world asked how he advanced so quickly, how would he answer?
        Did he just eat a Blood God's spawn and advance?  That's impossible!
        It wasn't like no one had eaten it before.
        After some consideration, he exhaled."Just say that it's because you learned the breathing technique of five birds! The breathing technique of five birds, when used in conjunction with the Scion of the blood God, has a special effect that allows one to break through the bottleneck more easily!"
        The breathing technique of five birds!
        Just as Li Hao was about to speak, Yuan Shuo glanced at him with a stern look.
        It was the breathing technique of five birds!
        The outside world knew that Yuan Shuo had a unique breathing technique that was effective against superpowers. Yuan Shuo was involved in the energy absorption technique used by the night watchers.
        However, the breathing technique of five birds was rarely taught to outsiders.
        Previously, Duan tiandou was attracted by the breathing technique of five birds and became greedy.
        If word got out that the breathing technique of five birds was helpful in breaking through bottlenecks, it would probably attract more attention and make more powerhouses covet this cultivation technique.
        "The breathing technique of five birds has never been taught to outsiders!"
        "If someone asks you, just tell them that you've only learned the simplified version," Yuan Shuo continued."You're mainly relying on me to help you use the breathing art to absorb and digest the blood God!"
        This thought came to Wang Ming's mind, and he said softly,"Teacher ... This ..."
        Would it cause some trouble?
        "Why don't I just say that I'm talented ..."
        "Bullshit!"
        Yuan Shuo cursed,"if your talent is that good, you'll be a God-tier master blessed by the heavens!" Of course, you can say that to most people, but if hou Xiaochen and the others ask you, you can use the same method I just used. "
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Understood!"
        Wang Ming hurriedly nodded.
        "Go in!"
         Yuan Shuo pointed to the training room and said,""After you enter, clear your mind and don't think about anything. When you feel the influx of energy, you can start cultivating. Don't worry about anything else!"
        "Yes!"
        Wang Ming didn't dare to say anything more and hurried into the practice room.
        As for Yuan Shuo, he waved his hand and closed the door.
        He looked at Li Hao."Just transfer it through space. It doesn't matter if a little of it is wasted or leaked."
        "Even if he really did say it out and didn't see anything, we can still avoid some trouble."
        It wasn't impossible to transmit it through space, but there would definitely be some overflow and waste some mysterious energy.
        Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded.
        He knew that his teacher was doing this to protect him to the greatest extent, so he didn't say anything.
        Li Hao and Yuan Shuo walked to the training room and sat down. A moment later, Yuan Shuo took out an energy storage box filled with metal-type superpowers.
