        id that something was not right. The Python was running forward. There was clearly a Bare Mountain in front of them, which was not as safe as the jungle, but the Python was still running in this direction. It clearly had its own purpose.
         Now, as expected, after beating the young one, the old one came.
         This snake was very terrifying!
         Banshan was a little solemn. When he escaped just now, he thought that the other party would deal with tsunami first. After all, tsunami was the one who had been attacking. However, he didn 't. The other party actually stopped him. This meant that this big snake wanted to kill them all!
         In an instant, he understood the meaning behind it and no longer complained. At this time, only by joining forces could they fight against this trouble.
         Tsunami's face was also solemn at this moment. He looked at the huge snake and was extremely vigilant. He quickly gathered with the mountain and looked around, already looking for a way out.
         As for the giant snake, it merely whipped its tail back halfway up the mountain and did not continue.
         It wasn't until the smaller Python crawled behind it with great difficulty that the large snake's huge eyes revealed some blood-red killing intent.
         Banshan was instantly filled with regret!
         He and tsunami were worried that the snake would continue to attack and had been on alert. They didn't expect to hit the big snake. They were waiting for the small snake to join them, which was a little beyond his expectations.
          Snakes were all cold-blooded animals, right?
         Even if he had become a demon, he was still one, right?
         Why ... Did this snake still care about the life and death of this little snake?
         The giant snake waited until the smaller snakes gathered and hid behind it before it looked at the two sunguang. At this moment, a unique power was locked on the two of them.
         The huge eye glanced at the shield.
         He looked at Banshan a few more times. When that tail hit this person, half of the power was blocked by this shield, and the other half was actually taken by this black-clothed man.
         Tsunami was also a little nervous at the moment. She also knew that she had hit the snake's nest.
         p She also knew that great demons could actually understand words.  Therefore, tsunami spoke,"respected strong man, this is a misunderstanding. We didn't know that this is your territory ... We will retreat immediately. We have hurt your ... Your race. We are willing to compensate for its loss!"
         She took out a few divine power stones.
         The snake was too fast, and she wasn't sure if she could escape before it could react.
         The giant snake looked at her coldly.
         The next moment, a huge tail suddenly whipped through the void and fell toward her.
         "Fight! There's no way to reason with them!" Banshan shouted in a low voice.
         Tsunami, this useless trash, what else can he say?
         Would you be willing to kill your son and daughter for a few divine power stones?
         Idiot!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Banshan instantly disappeared from his original spot and escaped into the darkness. The next moment, a small black sword appeared and stabbed at the snake's tail!
         The tsunami also let out an angry roar. The ocean surged and a force of water swept across the world.
         BOOM!  This tail instantly broke through the water energy. Just as it was about to hit the tsunami, the tsunami suddenly turned into a stream of water light and disappeared. When it reappeared, it was already behind the giant tail.
         At this moment, the Sunglow powerhouse revealed his strength.
         Even if the other party was very strong, the two of them still had the confidence to fight. Even if they couldn't win, they couldn't escape easily. They had fled before the halfway point of the mountain because they were prepared to escape before the other party could react.
         Since he had failed, escaping now would be gambling with his life.
         He was betting on whether this snake would kill tsunami first or kill him first, or whether the other party would be able to catch up with him after killing tsunami alone.
         He was not willing to live alone like this.
         So, he chose to fight back.
         With a loud bang, the small black sword slashed across the snake's tail, and sparks flew. The snake's hard scales were as hard as armor.
         The mountain trembled.
         What a strong defense!
         He was a sunrise light expert, and this could be considered a surprise attack, but it had actually failed to break through the opponent's defense. This snake was at least at the peak of the sunrise light realm!
         Terrifying!
         However, this snake was too big. Being big also meant that it was a little clumsy at times. Although this snake appeared to be very agile, its size also gave Banshan and the others an opportunity.
         The two sunrise experts were small compared to the giant snake, but small meant that they could escape easily.
         With a single strike, a burst of flames burst out. Banshan's figure disappeared again, and the snake tail once again broke through the air, hitting nothing.
         Half of the mountain had disappeared.
         On the other side, the tsunami condensed into thousands of water arrows, which shot toward the eyes of the other party!
         The snake closed its eyes. Clang, clang, clang ...
         A series of loud sounds rang out, and also shot out streaks of flames. The ten thousand arrows exploded, and the tsunami was also shocked. This was too powerful!
          The next moment, the tsunami turned into a stream of water and retreated further away.
         She and Banshan had the same thoughts at this moment.
         They would fight first to disturb this giant snake, and then retreat together. They would fight as they retreated. If they worked together, this giant snake wouldn't be able to kill them so easily.
         Behind them, Yama's people were there.
         The three suns were slower, but they should be here soon.
         If the 17 three suns came, those guys would be even slower and it would be hard to escape ... At that time, everyone could work together to fight the enemy, maybe ... Maybe they could take down this big snake!
         Yes, at this point, tsunami and Banshan both had the same idea.
         Capture this great snake!
         A great demon at the peak of the rising light realm was extremely terrifying. However, if he could really capture it ... The rewards would be unimaginable. Could there be any precious treasures in the huge Valley where the huge snake was located?
         At this moment, they could even vaguely see some golden light appearing on the other side of the valley.
        
         When the Python failed to kill them in one blow, these people became even more greedy.
         This was dangerous, but it was also an opportunity.
         Just as they were fighting, behind them, the reincarnation King and the others seemed to have felt something. Very quickly, the reincarnation King transformed into a gust of wind and flew over. When he was a thousand meters away from the snake, his eyes suddenly changed!
         Demon!
         And it was an extremely powerful great demon that was suppressing the two sunguang 's.
         The Samsara King turned around and was about to leave. At this moment, the 16 Lords of Hell rushed over and saw the snake.
         "It's so big!"
         "Great demon!"
         "Rising light ... No, peak rising light!"
         In fact, it couldn't be seen, but the fact that a big demon was beating two sunguang to the point where they couldn't fight back showed that this snake was extremely powerful.
          However, it shouldn't have exceeded the scope of sunrise.
         The Samsara King was about to leave, but the 16 Lords of Hell's eyes flickered, ready to make a move.
         At this moment, in the distance, Banshan also shouted,""Let's join forces and kill this snake! "Let's not talk about the benefits. If you retreat ... Once we are defeated ... Its speed is far faster than the three suns. It will attack you one by one, and you will not be able to escape!"
         Bang! Bang!
         As he spoke, he was distracted. In that moment, a boom could be heard as the huge snake tail covered him. A huge boom could be heard as the illusory image on the shield became even more illusory.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Banshan coughed up blood and was sent flying. Without waiting for the giant tail to whip him again, he instantly retreated into the darkness and disappeared once again.
         He was too strong!
         If it wasn't for the fact that the snake couldn't hit them, they would have been dead with a few tails.
         Was this guy really Xuguang?
         Or perhaps, he had already surpassed sunguang?
         Banshan's heart was filled with shock. This snake seemed to be on par with hou Xiaochen. When hou Xiaochen killed Xuguang, it was the same. However, when hou Xiaochen killed Xuguang, the red-haired man couldn't escape.
         He had an origin divine weapon, so he had only been injured and not killed after dodging a little.
         Peak of the rising light?
         ……
         At this moment, the 16 Lords of Hell also looked at the Samsara King.  The reincarnation King didn't say anything. He just wanted to leave.
         ? It was too dangerous to take advantage of the entanglement between the snake and the two sunrises to escape first.
         However, at this moment, the Lords of Hell were ready to make a move. One of them looked at the valley behind the snake and saw the golden light. His eyes changed."A Supreme treasure! It must be a treasure ... This giant serpent's protection is definitely not simple. It might even be a treasure that's accompanying it to a higher level ..."
         Before the Samsara King could speak, the other Lords of Hell chimed in,""He's very strong. However, no matter how strong he is, he's still sunguang ... If we join forces and work together with those two sunguangs, we can kill him!"
         With 17 three suns, two sunguang, the Samsara King and the origin divine weapon, would they still be unable to kill this huge snake?
         The snake itself was a treasure!
         A Lord of hell said greedily,"the snake blood, meat, and galls are all treasures that can increase one's strength!" As for snakeskin, it is the best material to forge a transcendent divine weapon ... In fact, we might even be able to look into the future of the rising light! Samsara temple master, let's go!"
         The reincarnation King transmitted his voice,'are you crazy? Retreat, this snake is too strong. Even half the mountain is suppressed and can't fight back. If we go up, we'll die if we're not careful ..."
         "Wealth is found in danger! Was the Samsara temple master used to retirement in Silver Moon? Out of the ten Palace Masters, only you, reincarnation King, are not Xu Guang...The opportunity is right in front of you, yet you don't know how to fight for it?"
         This time, without waiting for him to speak again, the 16 three suns instantly attacked!
         These people didn't charge in like a swarm of bees, but in the blink of an eye, their powers burst out and formed a special cage, hell cage!
         One of the 16 Lords of Hell shouted,""Let's kill this snake together. We'll split the loot after we've killed it. You two are smart people. Don't choose to act recklessly for some benefits!"
         "I won 't, don't worry!" Banshan quickly shouted.
         The tsunami turned into water and surged in the air. Water arrows shot out from her side and hit the other party's eyes. At the same time, she said,""Don't worry, we're not idiots ..."
          Greed was one thing, but with such a powerful enemy still around, they wanted to harm others. Even a tsunami wouldn't do it. It was too dangerous, and it was easy to be wiped out.
         At this moment, the powerful snake was a little irritated.
         In the past, all superpowers were killed by a tail.
         In fact, it had not experienced much. This time, it had encountered two bug-like superpowers and had not been able to kill them a few times. Furthermore, the other party had various means, such as disappearing into thin air or turning into mist ... This made the large snake, who was good at breaking through with brute force, a little annoyed!
         Not only that, the 16 Lords of Hell spread out in all directions. In an instant, the huge cage expanded to a radius of several hundred meters. Beams of special energy formed a large net and enveloped the giant snake.
         The leader of the group, the bone-striking and burning hell Lord, shouted in a low voice,""The two of you, come out from the gaps of our Avici iron net. Once we lock onto it, we will kill it together!"
         The hell of avicinaraka was said to be under the control of the king of equality and had 16 small Hells under his jurisdiction.
         At this moment, the 16 Lords of Hell cast an Avici iron net that was similar to a formation. Rays of light flashed and formed a large net, which enveloped the huge Python.
         The crack was very big. Normally, he could seal this crack, but it would consume a lot of mysterious energy. However, he didn't need to do it today. This snake was too big. There was no need to seal it. It was just enough for the two sunrises to come out.
         By the time they locked onto the Python, it would be difficult for the Python to break through no matter how strong it was.
        
         The net fell quickly, and the giant snake's eyes revealed a trace of anger as it whipped its tail!
         BOOM!
         One of the network cables was instantly broken, but it was restored the next moment.
         The giant snake slithered and charged forward. BOOM!
         The network cable was broken again, and the 16 Lords of Hell trembled in shock!
         The 16 of them had once worked together to lock down a sunguang. The other party couldn't move at all and was at their mercy. Because of this, the 16 of them were very arrogant and didn't take the Samsara King seriously.
         They had killed Xu Guang before, so they were not afraid of him.
         Even hou Xiaochen, who killed Xuguang ... They don't think it's a big deal. We've killed him before.
         If they had run into hou Xiaochen, they would have been confident in locking him down if they worked together. But now, this snake had broken through their hell of avicinaraka net so easily.
         "Steady!"
          One of the Lords of Hell shouted and unleashed his power. The others followed suit and someone shouted,""Banshan, tsunami, why aren't you attacking?"
         The two sunguang took the chance to come out.
         At this moment, Banshan and tsunami were also a little shaken. The 16 Lords of Hell under King Pingdeng were really capable. They actually used the power of three yang to lock down a peak stage sunrise!
         Although the Python was constantly crashing and breaking the network, there were many network cables. Every broken one was quickly replenished. The Python's rampage failed to break the hell of avicinaraka network.
         At this moment, Banshan's eyes also moved. With a wave of his hand, the small shield rapidly enlarged and instantly enveloped the network lines, adding another layer of defense. The big snake collided with it, and a loud bang was heard. This time, it did not break the network lines.
         Everyone was overjoyed!
         One sunguang and 16 three suns joined forces and finally stabilized the big net. In this way, no matter how strong this snake was, it was just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered!
         Although the 16 Lords of Hell were pale, they all shattered their divine power stones to replenish their divine power.
         Tsunami also let out a shrill cry, and the water arrow was fired again.
         "Wheel rotation!" At this moment, Banshan shouted.
         The Samsara King, who had not made a move all this while, frowned and sighed. He did not say anything else. Since things had come to this ... He might as well make a move. He was just a little angry and annoyed. The 16 Lords of Hell did not listen to him at all.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, when he saw their Avici Hell net, he also knew why these guys were so arrogant!
         The reincarnation King did not say anything. With a wave of his hand, a bell-like treasure appeared. It was the origin god weapon!
         This bell-like treasure was spinning rapidly in the hands of the reincarnation King. In the blink of an eye, countless wind blades burst out. These wind blades were extremely powerful and shot towards the giant snake through the holes in the net!
         At this time, Banshan and Lord of hell 16 were responsible for locking onto the giant snake, while tsunami and the king of Samsara were responsible for killing the giant snake.
         It seemed that this was not the first time the three organizations had worked together. The division of labor was very clear. Both sides did not have much discussion and chose the best way to attack.
         ……
         In the distance.
         Li Hao was actually peeking.
         At this moment, Li Hao also secretly gasped.
         On one hand, he was shocked by the Python's strength, and on the other hand, he was surprised by the formidability of the three major organizations. They were indeed very powerful when they joined forces, but ... What surprised Li Hao was that the three of them could cooperate seamlessly!
          In Li Hao's opinion, the three great organizations still had many differences and grudges.  However ... What shocked Li Hao was that the experts of the three great organizations had joined forces without any disagreement.
         Otherwise, any one of the three parties would probably be doomed if they encountered the snake.
         However, with the three of them working together, the snake was really unlucky.
         Li Hao frowned. He was wondering if the other three demons in the valley would make a move.
         Also, where are the southern Fist and golden spear?
         "If the three great demons don't make a move ... Then these people might really be able to kill this great snake ..."
         At this moment, Li Hao also had a headache.
         He didn't feel anything when the Python was killed.
         However, what if these people stopped provoking the three great demons after killing the Python?
         Instead, they were determined to kill him?
         To be honest, if these people joined forces, even a peak stage sunrise cultivator would find it hard to escape. Didn't you see how that huge net had directly locked a top-notch expert?
         However, this snake was the weakest among the four demonic beasts, right?
         Li Hao thought to himself. At this moment, he could clearly see the source of the snake's light. The light was blinding, but it wasn't as blinding as hou Xiaochen's group. Li Hao's tears back in the valley shouldn't have been caused by the snake.
         The other three great demons in the valley might all be stronger than this snake.
         "This is almost one against four ..." He thought.
         The 17 three suns were definitely comparable to the two rising lights joining forces. They were equivalent to Orochi and could fight against the four rising lights. It was extremely terrifying.
         At this moment, Li Hao finally realized how powerful hou Xiaochen was.
         It was no wonder LAN Yue and the group of rising stars didn't dare to act rashly.
         It would be difficult to deal with hou Xiaochen without at least four or five xuguangs.
         ……
          At the same time.
         In the valley.
         The three greater demons were slightly agitated.
         The little snake seemed to be trapped.
         As expected, he was very useless.
         At this moment, a special fluctuation spread in the valley. The special fluctuation came from the fierce tiger.
         A specific fluctuation appeared above the other two beasts.
         "The little snake is very useless. It's trapped ... This Golden Lotus ... Will probably take a while to mature."
         "You'll go?"
         The Golden Condor also sent out a special wave.
        
         The Tiger looked at the Golden Condor, and the Golden Condor looked back at the Tiger.
         As for the giant ape, it was also fluctuating at this moment. "Don't let me do it. The little snake is a little weak. It made too much noise. Also, other than these superpowers, it seems like there is a Martial Master nearby ... Hmm, very strong. I think I saw that fool back then ... The one who beat you ... Your clan!"
         "You're talking nonsense!"
         The ferocious Tiger roared slightly, its voice weak.
         The giant ape didn't seem to care. Its nose twitched slightly."I only said that a Martial Master similar to him is very strong ... His blood Qi is exuberant. I'll deal with this guy!"
         The Golden Eagle also spread its wings slightly, and the fluctuations were somewhat lazy.""I'll go help the little snake!"
         The tiger's tail turned slightly.""Other than that one with a very strong vitality ... There seems to be another human. I'll go deal with him!"
         In an instant, the three great demons actually chose to attack.
         The next moment, the Golden Eagle spread its wings and flew away, disappearing without a trace.
         As for the giant ape, with a leap, it also disappeared.
          The Tiger glanced at the Golden Lotus and disappeared in a flash. Its speed was boundless, and it also disappeared into the valley.
         ……
         The 17 three suns and two sunguang were madly attacking the snake.
         Some of the tough scales of the snake were broken, and it let out an angry hiss.
         A drop of the snake's blood fell to the ground, causing the earth to shake.
         And under the body of the big snake was a small snake.
         At this moment, a sudden fluctuation spread out, and everyone instantly understood the meaning behind it.
         "So weak, so stupid, little snake ... You really don't have any abilities ..."
         The giant snake's eyes showed a touch of anger and some inferiority, right?
         In the next moment, a golden light flashed and a Lord of hell was torn apart. The huge Golden Claw tore the void!
         In the blink of an eye, one of the three Yang's was torn into pieces!
         BOOM!
         The giant snake went berserk and broke through the net. It was extremely furious and whipped its tail out. With a loud boom, it sent the small shield flying. The next moment, it whipped out its tail again and turned one of the 16 Lords of Hell, who was vomiting blood, into a pulp of flesh!
         The Golden Eagle's speed was much faster.
         In the blink of an eye, a golden light flashed. PU, PU, PU ... A series of shattering sounds could be heard. Seven or eight of the 16 Lords of Hell, who had been extremely arrogant just a moment ago, had been killed in the blink of an eye!
         This sudden change shocked everyone.
         The next moment, he turned around and ran without even looking back!
         This was crazy!
         There was still a Greater Demon!
         Just as he ran, a loud sound suddenly came. With a rumble, a figure flew out. In the distance, Nan Quan directly rose into the air and roared,""I didn't do anything bad ..."
         BOOM!
         A punch was thrown out. It was the fist of the giant ape, and this punch seemed to Shatter the Sky!
         Southern Fist was so depressed that he almost vomited blood!
         'I'm ... F * cking unlucky. '
         I just came to take a look. How would I know that all of you were here? I didn't even do anything ... This giant ape actually smelled me and found me. Moreover, it was extremely fast.
         He also threw a punch!
         BOOM!
          The heavens and earth rumbled as Nanquan was sent flying. He spat out blood and almost cursed.  Peak of sunrise?
         No, maybe even stronger.
         "Eh ... Amazing ... Thirty-five useless rookie fist Kings?"
         At this moment, a surprised voice entered Nan Quan's ears. Nan Quan was shocked. The next moment, he realized something. As he spat out blood, he looked at the giant ape. As expected, the giant ape's eyes revealed a trace of doubt.
         Crippled fist King?
         What and what!
         Needless to say, at this moment, he roughly understood where this giant ape had heard the name from. Yuan Shuo!
         It was definitely him!
         That's right, this giant ape was definitely one of the five birds force that Yuan Shuo had comprehended back then.
         The giant ape seemed to be very curious, and it punched again!
         BOOM!
         The sky fell and the earth cracked. Nan Quan broke through the air and escaped in an instant. Don't mess around, he's too powerful. His strength is also incomparably strong, but this person ... Can't be provoked!
         He had just escaped when a tiger's roar suddenly reverberated in the distance!
         BOOM!
         At this moment, a sword radiance shot through the heavens and earth. The heavens and earth were overturned, the earth cracked open, and the sky split open!
         "I ... I'm really just passing by!" Someone helplessly said in the distance.
         What a helpless thing!
         "Roar!"
         The ferocious Tiger roared and the world trembled. Countless trees instantly crumbled and turned into dust, revealing a large open space. The ground had long been split open. A man holding a long sword said with a helpless expression,"Really ... I ... I really didn't mean to pick a fight ..."
         A sharp glint appeared in the Tiger's eyes!
         "One of the thirty-five pieces of trash?"
         “……”
         What and what!
         "The Tiger that was beaten by Yuan Shuo?" Hong Yitang was speechless.
         "Roar!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Cough, cough, sorry, sorry!"
          Hong Yitang retreated quickly with his sword in hand. He said helplessly,""It's a misunderstanding. I'm leaving. You guys can continue and have fun ... I'm here to look for my daughter. Let's not hurt each other ... If we really fight to the death, this is not the only treasure land in the Cang mountains. Be careful not to attract a stronger existence ..."
         The fierce Tiger's eyes were cold as it looked at Hong Yitang!
         "One of the seven ruined swords?"
         “……”
         Go to hell!
         Hong Yitang was speechless. The Tiger that Yuan Shuo beat up was also so cheap!
         In the distance, Banshan was stunned. He ran over and saw a giant ape and Nan Quan.
         A ferocious Tiger and ... Hong Yitang?
         He couldn't believe it!
         He didn't dare to think about anything else and immediately fled. At this moment, there was only one direction, which was an uninhabited place. He didn't dare to stay. Behind him, there were screams. In the blink of an eye, the 16 Lords of Hell were completely torn apart by the Golden Eagle and the giant snake.
        
         The king of equality's most powerful means of suppression had been shattered in the blink of an eye.
         The strength of the Golden Eagle was much greater than that of the great snake.
         Just as Banshan was about to escape, his scalp went numb. In the sky, a golden light flashed. Hua la, the air was torn apart, and a giant Golden Claw instantly appeared above his head. Banshan's expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly disappeared into the darkness!
         Invisibility!
         However, a golden light appeared in the Golden Eagle's eyes. BOOM!
         The darkness was broken and in an instant, Banshan appeared. His claws descended and with a crack, one of his arms was crushed. Banshan took the opportunity to escape again.
         The Golden Condor's eyes revealed a fierce look. With a long cry, it instantly broke through the sky and disappeared from its spot. When it appeared again, it grabbed Banshan out of the darkness with its claws!
         In the next moment, Banshan turned around and ran towards the tsunami in fear.
         At this moment, tsunami was also hit by the snake's tail. With a loud bang, he flew out, but he didn't dare to stay. He fled immediately. Even if he was seriously injured, he couldn't care less.
         The 16 Lords of Hell were killed in an instant, and their joint force was shattered in the blink of an eye.
          Whether it was the giant snake or the Golden Eagle, they were all extremely terrifying existences.
         More importantly ... There were more than two of them!
         There were two more!
         Fortunately, the two of them were stopped by the southern Fist and the earth overturning sword ... No, it was the two great demons who stopped them.
         At this time, no one had the time to think about why these two people were so strong.
         Why were these two people following them?
         There was no need to think about it!
         The only thing he had to think about was how to escape and survive.
         Who would've thought that there were four great demons living in the Cang mountains? moreover, the key was that these four great demons didn't fight each other. Instead, they attacked together when one of them was in danger!
         This was what was even more terrifying!
         On the other side, the earth overturning sword looked over. It looked at the mountain with a broken arm, at the tsunami that was seriously injured and flying backward, and then at the Samsara king who was frantically escaping with the wind chimes ...
         He really hoped that these guys would not die.
         Live well!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com To buy him some time ...
         However, all these trash were going to die.
         Hong Yitang then looked at Nan Quan, who was being suppressed by the giant ape and continuously spurting blood ... As expected, Nan Quan was also a piece of trash. He was slightly stronger than he had expected and had the strength of a mid-stage Sunglow.
         But ... He was no match for the giant ape!
         Of these four great demons, one was at the peak of the rising light realm, while the other three were at a critical point of their transformation. Once they transformed, they would be above the rising light realm. They could be called great circle of the rising light realm or even half a step beyond it.
         The ferocious Tiger in front of him was one of them.
         The earth overturning sword kept retreating with a smile on his face."Brother Hu, you don't have to kill a passerby ... My sword is not weak! "You ... Seem to be guarding some treasure, waiting for the opportunity to transform. If you fight me, you might get injured. If you get injured, you'll delay your transformation. Wouldn't that be a great loss? I didn't do anything, did I?"
         The Tiger looked at him coldly, its limbs trembling slightly. It was not afraid, but it was ready to attack at any time.
         It was very powerful!
         However, so what?
         These humans were all bad.
         The person in front of him reminded him of that despicable fellow from many years ago.
         At this moment, the Tiger didn't want to hear anything. It just wanted to kill this guy.
         In an instant, the Tiger was like a cloud as it floated in the air. A white mist rose and covered the earth overturning sword. It was a Water Tiger!
         Hong Yitang cursed in his heart but didn't care too much. He slashed out with his sword, split the clouds and mist, and ran away.
         On the other side, Nan Quan was sent flying by a single punch. Borrowing the enormous force, he headed straight for Hong Yitang. With some helplessness and sadness, he roared,""Bring me along ... Brother Hong, let's go together, don't run away by yourself!"
         How sad!
         Hong Yitang didn't even care, go to hell!
         You can run on your own!
         I don't want to be with you. It's hard enough to deal with a Tiger, and now there's a giant ape ... Do you want us to die together?
         At this moment, a loud noise came from the distance.
         With a boom, the Samsara King was struck by the giant snake's tail, and his body exploded. However, with the power of the origin god weapon, he turned into a gust of wind and instantly broke through the snake tail's blockade, converging towards the mountain and tsunami.
         The three of them instantly gathered together. Without saying a word, the Samsara King enlarged the wind chimes. The three of them were instantly enveloped. The mountain and the tsunami also instantly infused countless mysterious energy into the wind chimes. The wind chimes were caught by the Golden Condor's claws. With a boom, a cracking sound was heard!  However, it did not shatter.
         From this, it could be seen that origin God weapons were not something that anyone could break.
         Even the powerful golden Condor could not crush the wind chimes.
         The three of them seemed to have worked together for many years. The reincarnation King controlled the wind chimes to cover them and quickly escaped out of the grey Mountain. The three of them were all vomiting blood, but they didn't care. They infused all their mysterious energy into the wind chimes to make them faster. They just wanted to get through the grey Mountain and escape!
         At this moment, the Golden Eagle's eyes were cold, and the snake slithered over quickly.
         The Golden Eagle was extremely fast. With a boom, it grabbed the wind chime again, slowing it down. Cracks even appeared on the defensive barrier. The three powerhouses roared and poured mysterious energy into the wind chime.
         ……
         Li Hao saw all of this.
         At this moment, he was so scared that he didn't move.
         The four great demonic beasts had all set out!
         This was also beyond his expectations ... As for now, he only glanced at the golden light coming from the valley in the distance. He couldn't be bothered to look at it anymore. The only thought in his mind was ... What should I do?
         Run?
         Would it attract attention?
         "Also, the southern Fist is quite strong, even stronger than I expected.
         Hmm, and Hong Yitang ... It's not the Golden spear. What about Hong Yitang's ball of light?
         Also, this guy was freakishly strong. The Tiger was also extremely powerful, but it couldn't take him down.
         In addition, the experts of the three major organizations were more powerful than expected. 16 three suns had been killed, but the three of them still cooperated so well. This made Li Hao wonder if the higher-ups of the three major organizations often cooperated.
         Otherwise, this was the first time they were working together, and they had such tacit understanding ... That meant that their battle awareness was extremely strong. Was that possible?
         At this moment, eight experts with the strength of the rising sun, a peak three-Sun Expert with an origin divine weapon, and 16 dead three-Suns gathered in the small mountain forest ...
         Such a battle had surpassed all of Silver moon's battles.
         Even when hou Xiaochen killed Xu Guang, it wasn't as big of a scene as this.
         At this moment, Li Hao made his choice.
         Playing dead!
         He didn't move and pretended to be dead. They weren't moving in his direction, so he chose to pretend to be dead and wait. The golden light might mean that the flower had matured. He wasn't interested, and he didn't have the mood.
         He only had one thought. Once this thing was cooked, these few demonic beasts might finish eating and leave, returning to their own homes.
         It was obvious that this place was not their permanent residence.
         Therefore, as long as he could make them leave, he would be able to survive. As for the treasure ... Li Hao didn't want to court death. Once these demon beasts realized that something was missing, some could fly, some could run, some could swim, and some could shuttle through the forest ... Li Hao felt that he might as well pray that these people would all die together!
         Moreover, the demon hunt squads were in the vicinity, and if they were to seize the treasure, it would definitely lead to these demon beasts looking for them everywhere, and they would definitely discover them, and those people would die without a doubt.
         If it was only one person, there was still a chance to try.
         At this moment, it was better to forget it.
         Li Hao was like a dead man. His body was covered in leaves and he lay on the ground, waiting for the battle to end. As for Hong Yitang, whom he had a good relationship with ... Forget it. It's not that I don't want to save him. I'm just not qualified!
         This person didn't seem to be in any trouble either. He was too F * cking powerful!
         Li Hao, who was lying on the ground, was still thinking about the battle just now. He was also thinking about who would survive in the end.
         Was there any hope for the southern Fist to survive?
         What about the experts from the three great organizations?
          Even if the experts from the three major organizations could survive ... If the southern Fist and Hong Yitang could escape, would they be able to walk out of the Cang mountains alive?
         He had been hiding his strength for many years, and today, it was all exposed.
         "I'm indeed very weak ..."
         Li Hao sighed in his heart. He might not even be a match for the Samsara King, who was the weakest among those present. This was a huge blow to him.
         At that moment, a tiger's roar reverberated through the heavens and earth from afar!
         The Golden Eagle's sharp screeches also resounded in all directions.
         The rumbling sounds continued!
         The entire Cang Mountain seemed to have fallen silent at this moment. The roars of the wild beasts had all disappeared, and only the voices of these great demons resounded in all directions.
         Among them, there were also angry curses from the southern Fist and Hong Yitang.
         The two seemed to be entangled again.
        
         (Having diarrhea again)
         The rumbling sounds continued, mixed with some fierce roars.
         The fact that the four great demons had not been able to take down those people could only mean that these people were ridiculously powerful.
         At this moment, while Li Hao was playing dead, he was also thinking about how he could escape if he was discovered by the four great demons.
         Be prepared for danger in times of peace.
         Although it wasn't his turn yet, what if he couldn't hide?
         On the side of the southern Fist and Hong Yitang, not to mention the southern Fist, Hong Yitang had hidden very well, but they were still discovered.
         These demon beasts seemed to be more sensitive.
         Moreover, the demonic beasts were actually cooperating. This was what made people's hearts palpitate even more.
         At this moment, Li Hao was thinking about whether he had not been discovered, or if he had been discovered, but he felt that he was too weak and was not in a hurry to deal with himself. Should he first deal with the strong before dealing with an ant like him?
          This was also very possible.
         Could he really avoid these great demons by feigning death?
         At this moment, several powerful demons were dealing with the experts. This was Li Hao's chance.
         If they were to escape now ... But they had to escape together with the demon hunt squad, otherwise it would be very easy for something to happen.
         Why don't I ... Pick up the corpse first?
         16 three suns had died, and Banshan's shield seemed to have been left nearby. The shield could be used to feed the small sword, and the mysterious energy of the 16 three suns could be absorbed to strengthen itself. If the sword energy absorbed the shield, it would be sufficient.
         However, this required time.
         How long would it take to take care of the four great demons before he could return?
         Although he hadn't made up his mind, Li Hao made his first choice ... To find the small shield first.
         When Banshan was attacked, he threw away his shield.
         Now, the three experts from the three great organizations could only rely on wind chimes for protection.
         He had to get the shield first. With enough sword energy, Li Hao would be more confident. Otherwise, he wouldn't have much confidence with only eight divine power stones left.
         Li Hao instantly got up from the ground.
         He quickly moved toward the landing point he had previously observed. He had been paying attention to the appearance of the origin divine weapon, while Banshan and the others had no time to care about it. Li Hao, on the other hand, had plenty of time.
         In the distance, the sword light shot into the sky. It was obviously Hong Yitang's technique.
         This guy was really powerful, but it was a pity that he had encountered four great demons.
         The southern Fist seemed to have joined him and brought him another powerful demon. Li Hao couldn't help but wonder, who were the stronger ones, Hong Yitang, hou Xiaochen, and the others?
         Would hou Xiaochen and the others be able to take on one of the greater demons?
          The Python shouldn't be a problem, and Li Hao couldn't determine the other three.  Li Hao's thoughts did not stop him from finding the small shield.
         A moment later, Li Hao saw a shield that had fallen to the ground not far away. It was very small, not too big, only slightly bigger than a plate. At this moment, its light was dim as it fell to the ground.
         He quickly moved forward. The small shield seemed to be alive. At this moment, an extremely weak shadow appeared on the shield as if it wanted to escape.
         The origin god weapon was that special.
         As long as the weapon soul was not dead, the origin god weapon would have the ability to move on its own.
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. There were four grades of origin divine weapons: heaven, earth, black, and yellow. The shadow snake sword that he had broken for the first time was said to be the lowest grade of yellow-grade origin divine weapons. This small shield should be stronger than that, right?
         Banshan was the leader of flying sky in Silver Moon, so this little shield should be at least profound grade, right?
         He grabbed with one hand. The Phantom on the small shield seemed to want to resist, but the small shield was heavily damaged and had no strength to resist. In an instant, The Phantom was broken by Li Hao and disappeared.
         Li Hao knew that it wasn't that the soldier soul was dead. It had just dissipated and didn't have enough energy.
         Without their master's support, these origin God weapons had nothing special about them except that they were made of sturdy materials. Some special abilities could not be used.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com For example, if the shield had enough energy, the soldier soul would be able to give the shield a strong defense.
         The Phantom disappeared, and Li Hao also grabbed the small shield.
         It was cold.
         It wasn't too heavy in his hands, and it even felt a little light.
         Li Hao took out the starry sky sword. Origin divine weapons were very difficult to destroy. Even if the shield lost its defensive power and the Golden Eagle couldn't scratch it, Li Hao knew that in the face of the starry sky sword, the strongest shield was useless.
         It was said that the fire Phoenix spear was a heaven-grade source god weapon. When it saw the small sword, it was terrified.
         At this moment, Li Hao was thinking about whether the small sword could absorb enough energy to strengthen itself and recover a large amount of sword energy after breaking the shield with the reserved soldier soul.
          After thinking for a while, Li Hao smiled.
         The shield's soul had always been there, so its disappearance did not really affect anything. When Banshan and the others activated the shield, they had only used the divine power Stone and their own energy to activate the soldier's soul.
         He didn't want to keep this origin divine weapon. The quality of the weapon was more important than the quantity.
         No matter how good the origin god weapon was, it was not as good as the small sword.
         Li Hao's eyes glowed. He held the short sword and slashed at the shield!
         At this moment, a small tortoise-shaped soldier soul appeared on the shield. When it saw the small sword coming at it, it seemed to have recovered a little and wanted to escape.
         A natural fear was imprinted in his heart.
         Even though these soldier souls had already lost their memories, they still couldn't help but feel fear at this moment.
         The shield struggled!
         In an instant, the short sword fell. With a crack, the shield was directly broken by the sword. At this moment, the powerful defensive power could not be displayed at all. A small hole was directly cut through by the sword.
        
         Just this one hole was enough.
         The small sword seemed to have broken through the defensive layer. In an instant, a strong devouring power burst out. The soldier soul struggled but was instantly pulled into the small sword. After a while, a strong sword energy gushed out.
         The small sword seemed to be very interested in the origin weapon, far more so than the divine power Stone.
         Not only did a large amount of sword energy flow out, but the sword body also grew a little longer, as if it was gradually being unsealed.
         The small sword, which was originally as long as an arm, grew a little longer at this moment. Not only that, but the small shield this time was probably even stronger, so Li Hao could clearly feel that the sword energy in the sword was extremely rich.
         This was probably the first time he had felt such dense sword energy since he had gotten the small sword.
         Li Hao's eyes lit up!
         As expected, the shield's level was very high.
         ……
         The moment Li Hao broke the small shield, the three experts who were cooperating with each other were fleeing frantically. Behind them, the Golden Condor and the Python were also chasing them quickly. The Golden Condor had tried to catch the wind chimes several times, but to no avail, which made the Golden Condor furious.
          At this moment, among the three of them, ban Shan's eyes suddenly revealed a look of fear.
         The next moment, he spat out a mouthful of blood!
         Not only that, but his spirit instantly became much more dispirited, and even the mysterious energy was shaken. With a bang, the mysterious energy attacked his body, as if it was somewhat out of control.
         To lose control at this critical moment ... It was simply an unimaginable disaster!
         The Golden Condor was indeed a top-notch powerhouse. At this moment, it seized the opportunity and struck out with its claws!
         BOOM!
         Windling's external defense was directly broken by it. Even the injured Banshan was caught by it, and half of his body exploded.
         Banshan's eyes revealed a hint of unwillingness and anger!
         Why?
         The three of them might have a chance to escape.
         As long as the wind chimes could be maintained, they would be able to escape the Cang mountains, and there would be hope for survival.
         But why ... Did the origin god weapon cut off its connection with him?
         As the owner of the origin god weapon, he had to infuse some of his mind power into it while refining it to control it. This was the only way he could make use of it effectively.
         However ... The backlash from the origin god weapon would almost never happen.
         Unless the origin god weapon was broken.
         However, in this era, how many people could break an origin divine weapon?
         Didn't you see that even the Golden Eagle found it hard to break it?
         However, his shield had been shattered!
         Banshan was frightened, angry, desperate, and also a little confused. Who did it?
         Could it be that ... There was an even more powerful demonic beast in the mountain?
         Did he discover my small shield and destroy it?
          If that was the case ... Then there was nothing else to say. This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He understood it in his heart, but the Samsara King and tsunami were puzzled. At this moment, tsunami screamed with madness and anger. What was this bastard Banshan doing?
         The two of them poured out their mysterious energy madly, hoping to repair the gap and continue their defense.
         However, Banshan had been the one to help out, and now that he was almost completely dead, he no longer had the energy to maintain the defense. The defensive shield on the wind chimes gradually weakened.
         The Samsara King's eyes revealed a look of despair.
         The next moment, he gritted his teeth and made up his mind. Suddenly, he kicked the erupting tsunami out!
         Yes, at this moment, he had chosen to save himself!
         The moment tsunami was kicked out of the wind chime, he was at a loss.
         She looked at the Samsara King in disbelief. However, the Samsara King was already alone. He quickly escaped with wind chimes. The tsunami happened to help him block it. He also threw down the half-dead Mountain.
         Even if the two sunrises were dying, it would still take some time for the Golden Condor and the Python to kill them.
         If it wasn't for Banshan's sudden accident, he naturally wouldn't have done this.
         However, at this juncture ... Even if it was just a little more hope of survival, he did not want to die like this.
         As for him, the direction he was escaping in was not outside the mountain.
         There was still a long way to go beyond the Cang mountains.
         The reincarnation King turned around and ran towards Hong Yitang and the others, hoping that the two experts would be able to disturb the beasts and give him a chance to escape.
         As for Banshan and tsunami, at this moment, one of them was dying, while the other was filled with anger and unwillingness.
         The tsunami let out a mad roar and water energy burst forth, blocking the Golden Eagle's giant claw. With the resentment of a dying person, it roared,""Rotation! Have you forgotten the agreement between the three major organizations? If you dare to betray us now ..."
         An agreement?
         This thought appeared in the mind of the escaping reincarnation King, but he forgot it in an instant. He was about to die, so what agreement was there to talk about?
         The three major organizations did have some agreements that were only targeted at some of the higher-ups.
         Once they were in danger or faced with enemies other than the three major organizations, they had to work together to fight the enemy.
          However, this could not stop his desire to live.
         Lord zhuanlun didn't even look back and fled madly.
         Behind him, a scream was heard. Tsunami's body was torn apart by the Golden Eagle. The next moment, a huge claw threw tsunami to the back. Tsunami was not dead yet, but at this moment, he was even more desperate.
         That was because the Golden Eagle had thrown her to the big snake that was a little slower.
         The Golden Eagle had injured the descendants of the Python before the tsunami. Obviously, it wanted the Python to take revenge on its own.
         The giant snake's huge eyes looked at the tsunami coldly. The next moment, a tail that was like a pillar that reached the sky hit the tsunami!
         BOOM!
         With a loud bang, it directly smashed a hole dozens of meters deep in the ground. In the hole, there was no more tsunami, only the overflowing water energy and the exploded flesh.
         At the same time, Banshan looked at the reincarnation King in the distance. He didn't hold any resentment, only a hint of mockery.
         Do you think you can survive?
        
         There was no hope!
         He looked at the Golden Condor's huge claws and felt a little regretful. There were still too many things that he had not completed and too many secrets hidden in his heart. However, life was full of accidents.
         Superpowers were even more dangerous.
         Who would've thought that two rising stars and 17 three suns would die Here just to kill Li Hao?  The three great organizations would suffer heavy losses this time.
         The number of powerhouses they lost was even comparable to the losses they suffered in the central region for one or two years.
         In the central region, the battle was intense.
         In a place like silver Moon, hou Xiaochen and the others didn't even have to do anything ... They had played themselves to death, how laughable.
         A hint of mockery appeared in Banshan's eyes. It was unknown whether he was mocking himself, the reincarnation King, or everyone else.
         At this moment, he was already fearless.
          In the next moment, the huge claw penetrated him completely!
         There was no longer any light in his eyes. However, at the moment of his death, Banshan was still thinking, Hong Yitang and the others, each of them hiding so deeply, what exactly do they want to do?
         The leader of Fei Tian seemed to be the same.
         The leaders of the three organizations didn't seem to make a move. They were all hiding their strength.
         Hou Xiaochen and the others were the same. Why?
         Since he wanted to conquer the world, since he wanted to seize a dynasty ... What was the point of hiding?
         Bang! Bang!
         The corpse fell heavily!
         The Golden Eagle retracted its claws and didn't even look at them. The next moment, it spread its wings and flew towards Hong Yitang and the others.
         The giant snake smashed the tsunami to death and quickly swam over.
         ……
         At this moment.
         Hong Yitang was also gasping for breath. On the opposite side, the fierce Tiger's body was covered in bloody wounds, while the giant ape was somewhat vigilant. Nan Quan's back was facing Hong Yitang, and he was covered in blood as he clenched his teeth and held on.
         He had only followed her once, but who knew that he would be so unlucky!
         Seeing that the mountaintop and tsunami had been killed, Hong Yitang was also extremely speechless!
         What was going on?
         These guys, each and every one of them was so weak, and they were killed so quickly.
         Hong Yitang gasped for breath and looked at the fierce tiger helplessly."Do you two really have to go this far?"
          "You two should be very familiar with Yuan Shuo ..."  "Roar!"
         The ferocious Tiger let out a furious roar.
         Hong Yitang laughed."You should know that the Silver Moon Martial Master was the strongest existence in this land back then. Today, the few of you working together are indeed powerful, but ... If you really force me, it won't end well for you."
         At this moment, the reincarnation King rushed over, ignoring the Tiger and ape. He landed on the ground and the wind chimes swayed. The reincarnation King roared,""Earth overturning sword, my wind chimes 'defense is invincible, and its attack is first-class ... Martial masters can also control origin God weapons. With your strength, if we join forces to support the defense, even they won't be able to break it!"
         Origin God weapons were not exclusive to supers.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the ancient civilization, perhaps martial masters were the right path, so they could naturally use origin God weapons.
         At this moment, the reincarnation King was also risking his life and rushing over. He was afraid that Hong Yitang wouldn't agree, so he even said hurriedly,""As long as I can survive this time, I will tell you all the secrets of the three great organizations. Some secrets are only known to us. I am one of the ten Palace Masters and I know many, many secrets ..."
         Hong Yitang laughed. This guy was really bold!
         In an instant, the Golden Eagle and the Python all rushed over.
         Cold sweat dripped from Nan Quan's face. He glanced at the Samsara King and cursed inwardly, trash!
         This is troublesome!
         Of course, he couldn't defeat the giant ape himself, so he came to look for Hong Yitang and was scolded as trash by Hong Yitang.
         The four great demonic beasts were now gathered together.
         The Samsara King and the other two were surrounded in the middle. The Tiger didn't continue to attack, but just looked at Hong Yitang coldly. It didn't even stop the Samsara King from entering.
         There was no other reason. Hong Yitang had locked onto it.
         If it tried to stop the reincarnation King, it might be attacked by a powerful sword.
         Hong Yitang exhaled and looked at the reincarnation King with a smile,""This wind chimes is impressive. As expected of one of the ten Hall Masters. It's at least an earth-grade origin divine weapon. Yama is willing to part with it."
          The Samsara King was overjoyed. Just as he was about to speak, his vision suddenly turned black as a sword ray descended!
         In the blink of an eye, the reincarnation king split apart.
         Hong Yitang killed his opponent with one strike. He reached out and wind chimes fell into his hand. He laughed."Not a bad treasure, really not bad ... By the way, did you kill the red shadow of the tsunami?"
         He glanced at the Golden Eagle and the snake."A Blood God at the sunguang level is a good supplement."
         Behind him, Nanquan transmitted his voice,"brother Hong, why did you kill him?" If we kill him, the origin divine weapon will be dormant. With him here, we'll be more confident. "
         Hong Yitang didn't care about them. He looked at the demonic beasts that surrounded him and grinned.""I really don't want to fall out with you. I didn't have any intention of causing trouble for you when I entered the Cang mountains. I'm just here to find my daughter ..."
         "As for me, I'm not too bad. However, I have a small problem. I burst too much and my five internal organs can't take it. I'm easily broken."
         "It's not just me. Many people have the same problem."
         "So, in the eyes of outsiders, we are all sinister villains who hide our strength ... Actually, that's not the case. We are just forced to do it. If we are too strong, people will find trouble with us every day. If you fight for no reason, you'll kill yourself eventually. "
         As Hong Yitang spoke, his five internal organs were damaged. Gradually, a monstrous sword essence filled the area.
        
         "But the few of you ... You seem to have gone too far!" If that's the case ... I don't mind releasing all my battle power ... At worst, my internal organs will be crushed. I'd like to see if I can kill the four of you!"
         BOOM!
         The sword intent spread out completely. At this moment, the four demonic beasts were all restless.
         The giant ape's eyes flashed with horror.
         The Tiger also took a step back, the snake stuck out its tongue, and the Golden Eagle flew into the air.
         Behind him, Nan Quan's face was also filled with shock. He couldn't help but say,""You ... Have you reached that stage?"
         Hong Yitang coughed and blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. He smiled and said,""What do you mean by this step and that step? do you know what Step That Step is? You're just a sunrise-ranked fellow, shut up!"
         Then, he looked at the four demonic beasts and said with a smile,""Cough, cough, cough ... Don't force me ... Otherwise, I'll let you all have a taste of the Might of the Earth overturning sword. Back then, when Yuan Shuo challenged me, I couldn't even be bothered to pay him any heed. Back then, you guys were suppressed by Yuan Shuo and beaten half to death ... Are you trying to show off your might now?"
         At this moment, the Golden eagle in the sky sent out a special wave."I didn't expect you to be so powerful ... Forget it, leave this person with vigorous qi and blood behind and you can leave ..."
         When he heard this, Nan Quan cursed in his heart!
          Are you bullying me?
         The next moment, he gritted his teeth and suddenly punched his own heart. With a loud bang, it was as if something had shattered near his heart, and a monstrous blood Qi began to boil!
         "F * ck your ancestors!" Nan Quan cursed angrily. Just do it! If I don't kill one today, I'll be letting myself down! Bastard, bastard! My potential lock, F * ck!"
         He cursed madly!
         At this moment, his qi and blood were surging. Not only that, his body was even emitting flames. The lock on his heart seemed to have been broken by him.
         Nan Quan was furious. His eyes were filled with ferocity and cruelty. He stared at the Golden eagle in the sky and said with a bit of madness,""Damn it. Now, it's not you who let me go. Earth overturning sword ... Let's work together and kill these few things ... There seems to be a treasure in that Valley that might be able to save us from our losses ..."
         At this moment, both of them had suffered heavy losses.
         One should not look at how their strength had skyrocketed. In fact, they had paid a huge price and even had some future prospects.
         How could the southern Fist not be angry!
         Hong Yitang was also surprised."Not bad ... You can actually drive it!"
         "You think you're the only one who's good all these years?" Nan Quan said angrily.ܳ! Let's kill these four, drink their blood, eat their meat, and then go to the valley to get some treasures......Maybe we can redeem ourselves!"
         ,m "He Yong, your personality ..." Hong Yitang laughed.  Then, he slashed out with his sword and roared,""F * ck!"
         At this point, he had unsealed his five organs, and his Southern Fist had shattered the superpower lock. The losses were simply too great. If he didn't fight now ... He wouldn't be willing!
         BOOM!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As the sword slashed out, the ground was directly torn apart. A crack that was hundreds of meters long instantly spread out. The Tiger and the giant snake wanted to retreat but were grazed by the sword light.
         The previously powerful snake scales were like thin paper at this moment. They were torn apart in an instant, and blood and flesh flew everywhere.  As for Nan Quan, he also let out a furious roar. He didn't care about the giant ape at all. He stomped on the ground and soared into the sky. He threw a punch and went straight for the Golden Condor. This golden Condor might be the leader of the four great demons.
         Just now, it was the one who wanted to make him stay.
         You want me to stay?
         I'll make you stay!
         BOOM!
         The fist and the huge claw collided. With a loud bang and a burst of flames, the Golden Eagle was directly sent into the sky. On its extremely solid claws, there were bloody marks.
         Nan Quan's fist was also covered in blood, but he didn't know if it was his or the Golden Eagle 's. The moment he landed on the ground from the impact, he threw a punch at the giant ape!
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         The deafening explosion was far louder than before!
         "Earth overturning sword, you still dare to call me weak?"
         Nan Quan roared in anger as he madly beat up the giant ape!
         Hong Yitang's sword swept around and he sneered,""He relied on destroying the superpower lock to activate it ... Isn't he still useless? Whether it's skysword or BA Dao, they're stronger than you after destroying the superpower lock. "
         "Go to hell!"
         BOOM!
         At this moment, the four great demons were in a difficult position. When the two of them unleashed their powers, they had already felt that something was wrong and wanted to stop fighting. Previously, they had only attacked because they felt that they had the two of them in the bag.
         However, at this moment, it was not that they did not want to let the two of them go, but that the two of them had suffered heavy losses. If they continued to use some treasures to make up for their losses, the two of them would not be willing to give up!
          With Nan Quan's sudden increase in strength, the giant ape that had suppressed him before was now being beaten up by him!
         Hong Yitang was even more terrifying. After a few slashes, he cut off the snake's tail and smashed it into the ground. It was like a huge mountain was suppressing the snake.
         As for the longsword, it rolled up and down and actually entangled the Golden Eagle and the Tiger in an instant!
         At this moment, the two of them were powerful to an unbelievable extent. However, the southern Fist could only suppress one great demon. What was truly shocking was that Hong Yitang was fighting one against three!
         However, the blood at the corner of his mouth was also increasing. Even when he was fighting, he kept coughing.
         The southern Fist was still fine, but the flames on its body were getting stronger and stronger!
         There was no joy in the depths of their eyes, only helplessness.
         It's finished!
         This time, even if they won, they were finished.
         All his years of accumulation and preparation had been destroyed by these great demons!
        
         ……
         In the distance.
         Li Hao was collecting the corpses and storage rings of the three suns ...
         Suddenly, he was stunned. He looked into the distance, and the next moment, he rose into the air and looked into the distance ... He was completely dumbfounded.
         Southern Fist ... Earth overturning sword?
         This ... Wasn't he being chased and beaten just now?
         How was that possible?
         At this moment, the two of them were extremely powerful. However, after looking at them for a while, Li Hao's expression changed slightly. Originally, the two of them did not have any orbs of light, but at this moment, a fiery red orb of light suddenly appeared on Nan Quan's body!
         The roar of the southern Fist resounded through the heavens and earth!
         "If I become a fire descent super ... I will slaughter all of you, bastards!"
          He roared madly!
         Li Hao's expression changed slightly."He broke the cardiac Super Lock?" he asked."His potential is unleashed?"
         At this moment, he instantly thought of this.
         Hong Yitang seemed to be slightly better, but the superpowers that had disappeared earlier had reappeared. It was colorful and different from before.
         What kind of state were these people in?
         The five organs 'Super Lock, if they broke it ... Would there be any special changes?
         With a loud boom, Li Hao saw a ferocious Tiger being sent flying into the sky.
         The next moment, a sword light flashed and pierced through the sky and the earth, sending the Golden Eagle flying. Hong Yitang's cold voice was heard,""I said I was just passing by. Do you really think the Cang Mountain demon race is invincible?"
         "Heaven flipping!"
         With a low shout, the sky seemed to be overturned!
         That's right, at this moment, the sky was flipped over, and the earth and the sky seemed to be reversed. The Golden Eagle was originally flying in the sky, but suddenly ... It seemed to have landed on the ground.
         The Tiger was running on the ground when it suddenly felt that it was floating in the air!
         "Roar!"
         Roars could be heard as the six powerhouses instantly broke out into an intense battle. A huge snake had just burrowed out of the ground when it was directly sent flying by a punch from Nanquan and heavily crashed into the ground!
         As the battle became more and more intense, Li Hao saw this scene more and more clearly.
         He could even feel the anger and unwillingness of the two powerhouses!
         It was a kind of ... Unwillingness that they didn't know how to express. It was as if the four demonic beasts could only defend and couldn't satisfy their needs. It made them angry and more and more crazy!
         BOOM!
         The sword landed on the ground. The Golden eagle's wing was pierced through by the sword. With a backhanded slash, the Tiger's giant claws were covered in blood. Some of the sharp claws were even cut off.
         Li Hao was so fascinated that he even deliberately moved closer.
         At this moment, he had a vague idea of what had happened.
         His eyes flickered, and in the next moment, he hesitated ...
         He didn't know if he should reveal himself, or if he should ... Reveal the secret.
         Hong Yitang and Southern Fist were actually not bad.
         However, the southern Fist came from the royal family.
         Hong Yitang had also been hiding his strength deeply.
         But ... But watching these two people become more and more desperate, not the despair of death, but the despair of their future being destroyed ... That kind of feeling, he had actually seen it before.
         Teacher!
         Yes, when his teacher told him that his heart was broken and that he had no hope of fighting against Qian Jin, he had acted like this. Although he looked calm on the surface, his tone and eyes were telling of his despair.
         Hong Yitang had even given Li Hao some pointers, and the southern Fist had also told him some things to take note of ...
         A Martial Master!
          The Silvermoon Martial Master. The Silvermoon continent had always been dominated by martial masters!  At this moment, Li Hao still stood up and roared,""Martial uncles, let's end this quickly. I have a way to relock the Super Lock!"
         Following his words, a sword strike shook the heavens and earth!
         Hong Yitang's eyes suddenly lit up!
         Li Hao?
         Relock the Super Lock?
         As for Nan Quan, his eyes lit up. At this moment, he seemed to have thought of something. The next moment, he sent the giant ape flying with a punch and roared,""What do you need?"
         "Countless divine power stones, origin God weapons ..."
         "Alright!"
         BOOM!
         Nanquan had gone completely mad. He threw one punch after another until there was only this pair of fists left in the world.
         As for Hong Yitang, he roared,""Hand over a thousand divine power stones and stop the war. Otherwise ... You will die!"
         At this moment, he was the one who forced the four monsters to stop the war and hand over the thousand divine energy stones.
         Of the four great demonic beasts, the giant snake was already covered in blood, the Tiger's claws were broken, the Golden eagle's wings were pierced, and the giant ape's eyes were filled with ferocity. However, it could only be suppressed time and time again, and was constantly pushed back by the fists of Nan Quan.
         With Li Hao's words, the two powerhouses seemed to see hope.
         Would Li Hao lie?
         Probably ... Not!
         There was no need to do so at this moment.
         At this moment, they were extremely anxious. They only hoped that they could make up for their losses this time. Otherwise, even if they really killed the four great demonic beasts, it would be too late to recover.
         Hong Yitang's sword essence became more and more intense, and it was cold."Speed! If you don't make a decision now, when my five internal organs are completely unsealed ... You will all die. Of course, I might even be buried with you!"
         Nanquan also punched his own lungs. He coughed, bared his teeth, and roared,""Don't force me to break the second superpower lock, quick!"
         The four great demonic beasts all revealed a look of shock.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com These martial masters ... Could continue to grow stronger!
         Why was it like this?
         To die together?
         The next moment, the Golden Eagle's special fluctuation came."I don't have ... That many divine power stones ..."
         "However many you have, just hide one. Let's wait and see!"
         Hong Yitang roared. Even if there weren't that many of the four great demonic beasts, there were still so many dead people this time. There were also origin God weapons ... Perhaps it would be enough?
         He looked at Li Hao, who was flying in the distance, and asked loudly,""Do you need demonic beast blood?"
         “……”
         The four great demonic beasts were all somewhat solemn at this moment.
          At this point in the battle, they also knew that these two people seemed to have stimulated their potential. If they couldn't make up for it, they might really fight to the death with them.
         "No need for now," Li Hao shouted."But it might be better if there are treasures in the valley ..."
         At this stage, of course he would take as much as he could.
         The Golden Eagle and the other giant beasts all looked at Li Hao in the distance with cold eyes.
         Hong Yitang's eyes flickered."Just give us half. This time, you asked for it. If you can make up for our losses ... We won't find trouble with you anymore!"
         The Golden Condor's eyes flickered with coldness. A moment later, seeing that the two's auras were getting stronger and more uncontrollable, it made a choice."Alright!"
         Hong Yitang didn't say anything and flew out quickly. In the blink of an eye, some flesh and two storage rings appeared in his hands. He didn't forget that there might be some divine power stones in the corpses of the two sunguang.
         Nan Quan followed him and quickly flew towards Li Hao. At this moment, he was both excited and nervous.
         He could no longer suppress the fire energy in his body.
         If this continued, he would become a super!
