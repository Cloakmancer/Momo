Bullshit!Red Moon sovereign frowned. His suspicion was based on facts, but this man was talking nonsense.He glanced at Li Hao's group and frowned. Then, he looked at Ji Hao and said coldly,""Whether it's venerable sword in disguise or not, we'll know after a check! The Dao origin can't be hidden. Of course, even if it's Swordmaster in disguise, it'll be hard for us to check ... Why don't we let the Senlan realm Lord do it personally? We are all gathered here to deal with new martial. If this person is really from new martial ... Then Senlan sector Lord has enough reason and responsibility to investigate his true identity!""Daosource?""You want to check my Dao origin?" Li Hao asked coldly."Why can't I?""It wasn't me, it was sector Lord Sen LAN!" Red Moon sovereign sneered.Two birds with one stone!At the same time, he could also check on the state of the Senlan realm Lord. He was indeed suspicious of Li Hao's identity and wasn't looking for trouble for no reason. Besides, this person had killed a venerable sovereign on their side and should take revenge.No matter what, investigating a venerable sovereign's Dao origin was unacceptable and intolerable.As such, as long as Senlan investigated, she would fall out with this person.At that time ... He would naturally have a way to deal with this group of bastards!As long as Senlan fell out with the other party, whether the other party stayed in Senlan or fled ... He could forget about leaving the Crimson Moon alive.Ji Hao, on the other hand, was a little hesitant.The realm Lord was investigating ... And he was investigating someone else's Dao origin ... Wasn't this clearly going to turn hostile?That damned guy!However, what if he really was venerable the sword?Of all the things to use, you used a sword!It was really annoying!He was helpless as well. It wasn't easy to reply to this.He could ignore it and not take it seriously, but what if venerable sword was really in disguise?  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã While he was thinking, Li Hao suddenly laughed, since I'm working for Senlan, it's only right for you to check my background! I'm willing to accept the investigation ... But I have a request. It's not a high request. 30 million great Dao crystals!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEveryone was stunned.You want money over your life?The origin of the Dao is the foundation of the great Dao. You dare to let others check it?Are you courting death?Ji Hao was stunned as he laughed drily,"Fellow Daoist myriad Daoist, this ... This is just a passing remark ..."Li Hao shook his head."I know. Many people suspect that if this matter isn't resolved, I might be used as venerable the sword's substitute and killed. As for daosource ... What does it matter?" Which major cosmos absolute being didn't know the core secret of the Empyrean Dao origin? It's not like I'll kill you just because I know ..."This was interesting.Ji Hao's heart moved.What did he mean? Did this mean that ... This guy really had the intention of joining Senlan?If this person joined Senlan, it would not be a big deal if his Dao source was investigated. After all, if he really joined, he would have to fuse with the great Dao universe. As the master of the great Dao, he would definitely know.Red Moon sovereign also frowned and looked at Li Hao with a cold look.""You're quite bold! Aren't you trying to provoke Senlan to investigate you?"Li Hao looked at him coldly and said,"what does it have to do with you?" If I'm really revered sword artist ... I'll kill you with one strike!""You ..."Li Hao ignored him and looked at Ji Hao.""Of course, I'll only investigate one person, and that's sector Lord Sen LAN! The others are not qualified, and I will not allow outsiders to investigate me!"Ji Hao hesitated,"this ... The realmlord has been very busy recently. Moreover ... Dao friend myriad Daoist, investigating the Dao origin of humans is not ... Not what our Sen LAN is after ...""It's fine!"Li Hao's expression was relaxed."Actually, I'd love to do that. It can also eliminate my suspicion. If I kill someone again, someone will jump out and say that I'm a neo martial artist."For a moment, no one said a word.What was this good?Check?Ji Hao was still hesitating when suddenly, a voice reverberated from the void,"Little friend, do you really want to investigate the source of the Dao, verify your identity, and eliminate the suspicion?"At this moment, the entire world seemed to be fluctuating.The world seemed to have lit up!Ji Hao's expression changed slightly as he hurriedly bowed,"Sector Lord!"Red Moon sovereign's face also changed slightly. A powerful pressure was spreading in all directions, making him extremely fearful. A world Lord at the peak of Type 6!This was not something to be trifled with.Li Hao's face was filled with joy,"sector Lord Sen LAN?" Senior has also noticed the situation here? That's right, I'm trying to clear myself of suspicion. In fact, I used my sword to kill a strong enemy today in hopes of attracting the attention of the realm Lord. I also know that there will definitely be some people who don't want Sen LAN to be well and will jump out to associate me with the new martial Swordmaster ... What this person said is exactly what I want!"So that was how it was!Everyone's heart moved. So this guy did it on purpose.He was hoping for the Sen LAN sector Lord to come out.From the looks of it ... He had even decided to join the Senlan great world. Didn't this guy know the current situation of Senlan?At this moment, even the illusionary sector Lord Sen LAN was slightly surprised.He killed a venerable sovereign of a stage-three macro world with one sword strike. Although he was not a middle-rank venerable sovereign, he was at the top of the low-rank venerable sovereigns. He also had many venerable sovereigns with him. Why did he want to join Senlan?Did he have other motives?Or what?"My young friend, it's fine to investigate the source of Dao ... I believe you're not venerable the sword ..."Li Hao shook his head."There's not much difference. Realm Lord, you don't have to feel that it's inappropriate. Investigating my Dao origin is actually my purpose. It's better to know everything. After all, I've risen quickly and it hasn't been long since I formed a team. Most of the venerable sovereigns in the Crimson Moon zone don't know me well ... In that case, I need to prove myself that I can't let others associate me with neo martial. Otherwise ... I'll be dead!"

2881 Chapter 474
He was a smart person!At this moment, sector Lord Sen LAN chuckled,""Little friend, do you really have to do this?""Of course!"Li Hao looked around."However, it's still the same. Only sector Lords can investigate. As for the others ... They don't have the right!"Seeing Li Hao's confidence, Red Moon sovereign frowned and said in a low voice,""The daosource ... Might be able to be concealed ..."Was this person the sword Saint?If that was the case ... Perhaps it could be concealed?Li Hao laughed,"your words don't count!" Who Do You Think You Are? In front of the realm Lord, do you have the right to speak or question?"He laughed heartily."Realm Lord, if you can't find out whether or not I've concealed my Dao origin ... Only advanced venerable sovereigns can. If it really comes to this ... There's no need for me to hide it in front of you." But of course, if you don't trust me, I can fuse my daosource into the Senlan great world. "Sector Lord Sen Lan's heart trembled as he spoke, "There's no need to do this. The judgment of the Dao source is enough. If it's venerable the sword, it must still be related to the neo martial art's origin yin and yang. There will be conflicts between the great DAOs. ""Little friend, you only need to integrate your Dao origin into the great Dao of forest. If it comes from neo martial ... I'll definitely be able to find out."As soon as he finished speaking, a crack seemed to have appeared in the void.In different great Dao universes, once there was a conflict between the great Dao powers, it was obvious, just like how the power of the red moon would be struck by lightning when it entered the Silver Moon great Dao.If he was an itinerant cultivator ... It would be chaotic power that could be integrated into the great Dao universe without any conflict.Li Hao didn't waste any time. At this moment, he flew toward the universe of the great path.Everyone was shocked!Even sector Lord Sen Lan's heart trembled.If this person was Swordmaster, it would be a big problem if he rushed into the great path universe directly ... Of course, if he was really Swordmaster, he might also be seeking death by entering my great path universe directly!At this moment, Li Hao directly flew into the great Dao universe and stopped near the entrance. In an instant, a fiery light appeared on his body, as if a fierce tiger had appeared!The fire light shone through the heavens and earth, illuminating the great Dao of the universe.In the flames, a sword ray appeared. It was a pure Dao of fire that was extremely powerful and pure!He didn't look like a wandering cultivator!However, it didn't cause the great Dao to reject it. The pure power of the great Dao seemed to have obtained some fortune and inheritance. Sector Lord Sen Lan's heart moved slightly. He inspected it ... And a flame energy appeared in his mind.Very strong!He instantly realized that this person had received a fire-type inheritance, an extremely powerful fire-type inheritance.However, it was only the inheritance of the strong.He was not from the great path universe.No wonder he was so strong. This person might have obtained the inheritance of an advanced venerable sovereign, which was a great opportunity.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked relaxed and calm."Realm Lord, can I go out now?""Of course!"Li Hao instantly retreated from the Dao universe, and the Dao universe also instantly closed. Red Moon Emperor, who still wanted to see more, suddenly felt his vision blur. His heart shook, and he hurriedly closed his eyes. He heard sector Lord Sen LAN chuckling, "There's no need to be suspicious. Young friend myriad Daoist, you're quite lucky and talented. It's only natural that you've achieved what you have today! Ji Hao, since you've promised little friend myriad DAOs that you'll compensate him with a Dao crystal ... You've done your best for Sen LAN, so you can't be negligent!"Ji Hao also heaved a sigh of relief!The realm Lord had actually appeared personally to verify it. This also meant that there was no problem with the myriad DAOs sword. At least, it was not venerable sword in disguise.This was good!This was enough!For a moment, he revealed a smile,"definitely, don't worry realm Lord!.""I still have something to do. My Dao is unstable. Fellow Daoists, if you have time tomorrow, let's discuss Dao together ..."With that, the shadow disappeared.,m It seemed like he was just passing by ... In fact, the words "revered sword" had indeed attracted his attention. He was also worried that the "revered sword" had hidden in the forest world. Now that he had confirmed that it was not the "revered sword", it was fine!As for whether he wanted to conceal himself ... If the sword venerable was completely separated from the universe of origin, he couldn't do anything about it. Moreover, although this person used a sword, he was a fire-elemental cultivator and not a pure sword cultivator.That sword was not weak!In truth, the Senlan realm Lord could tell that the sword was a 4th grade Emperor weapon. It might have been obtained along with the inheritance, the myriad Dao sovereign. A fourth rank sovereign weapon, a seventh rank fire attributed cultivator's inheritance ... Killing a third rank venerable sovereign with a single strike was a very normal thing.At this moment, Li Hao smiled and looked at Ji Hao.""This time, we killed four venerable sovereigns, two at stage three, 60 million great Dao crystals, one at stage two, and one at stage one. In total, we killed 90 million great Dao crystals! In addition, investigate me. 30 million great Dao crystals, a total of 120 million great Dao crystals, and offer them to senior Hao, right?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùJi Hao was completely speechless!That's right, he said the same thing before.But ... You really killed four venerable sovereigns at once. To be honest, he still hasn't come back to his senses.You're ... Too bold!  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Did he really want money over his life?I'm a native venerable sovereign of Senlan. I don't even have the guts to do so.On the other side, Red Moon sovereign looked at Li Hao with a cold gaze. He didn't say anything more. Since sector Lord Sen LAN had already confirmed it, he would only be embarrassing himself if he continued!Now was not the time to bring out Hong Yue's identity and punish the other party."Let's wait and see!"He looked at the crowd coldly, and his eyes flashed with an ominous light. Then, he disappeared from where he was.This guy was hateful!Li Hao, on the other hand, shouted with a smile,""Collect the corpse. In addition, someone come with senior Hao and collect the Dao crystal! The rest of you will stay here and repair the crack. When we get the Dao crystal, we will continue to patrol the surroundings and protect the Senlan!""Yes, sir!"Everyone responded one after another. They were quite excited.He's fine?As for Ji Hao, he was a little speechless. They even sent people to follow them?They were really ... A bunch of people who valued money more than their lives!Forget it, so be it. Although 100 million was a lot, it was the realm Lord's request. Besides, after killing four venerable sovereigns ... To be honest, Li Hao and the others couldn't obtain much great Dao power. It had all been absorbed by the forest world.Senlan didn't suffer a loss.Furthermore, they had lost four enemies. They did not lose out in this deal at all."Then, fellow Daoist, have someone come with me. The forest orchid world doesn't lack this little bit of savings ..."Even though he said that, he was sighing in his heart. He really earned money.Li Hao then said,"right. You said that you'll give us 50 million great Dao crystals as the starting capital. You only paid 10 million, and you said that you'll pay the remaining 40 million if we make a move. So, with this 40 million, you'll have a total of 160 million, right?"Ji Hao was startled, and nodded his head awkwardly.Ëâπ!He suddenly realized that it was really easy to earn.100 million great Dao crystals were enough to buy a medium-sized world, and there were still extra. These ... These guys couldn't really be counting on killing venerable sovereigns to make money, right?However, when he thought about how many venerable sovereigns they had ... It didn't seem to be a lot."Yes, 160 million ..."Li Hao smiled and nodded."That's good. Qian Wuliang, go with your senior and get it. Then, come back as soon as possible.""Yes!"Qian Wuliang quickly responded and left with Ji Hao.As for Li Hao, he looked around and smiled.It was really profitable to kill venerable sovereigns."I only got 170 million great Dao crystals from killing a level Seven venerable sovereign!But now, killing a few low-level venerable sovereigns was just a matter of time.Sure enough, as venerable sword had said, the master of a major world was the one with the real deep foundation and no lack of money.At first, he had only wanted to get an identity ... But now, Li Hao was tempted. He could even make a fortune by guarding the forest orchid and killing foreign venerable sovereigns!

Chapter 2882 I Want To Eat Fish (1)
He would protect Senlan and gain some wool from it to strengthen his own strength.At this moment, Li Hao sincerely hoped that Senlan could live in peace for a while longer.A level-six great path universe was definitely not his ultimate goal.Venerable the sword and the others were used to changing locations after each shot. They would run away after they were done. However, if they killed Sen LAN, Cang Jiang, Tian Lan, Yue Ming, and Hong Yue would be on high alert and might even hunt them down.As such, it would be very difficult to make a comeback.In addition, if venerable sword didn't leave and appeared here instead to deal with Sen LAN, would Red Moon master still leave?He might not!Cast a long line to catch a big fish.This was what Li Hao was thinking.Of course, it might not be the intention of the sword Saint.At this moment, Li Hao was also considering whether he should agree or oppose if the venerable sword insisted on dealing with Sen LAN.  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Because the previous plan was to change locations after each shot.Now, he had changed his mind at the last minute and did not follow the original plan ... Would it have some impact?He even had some conflicts with neo martial.Neo martial's thinking was different from his.They believed in one thing: one kill meant one less. If they killed one today, they would kill another tomorrow ... If they could catch a big fish, they would. If they couldn 't, they would kill a few weak ones to weaken the opponent's strength.It couldn't be said that the other party was short-sighted. It could only be said that they had different habits.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao and the others stood beside the crack and began to repair it.The will of venerable sovereigns spread out from all around.The entire Senlan was paying attention to them.This group of people was crazy.They had only been here for a few days, yet they dared to kill several venerable sovereigns ... Were these people really not afraid of death?On the other side, Red Moon sovereign's eyes were extremely cold.This place was not too far away from Hong Yue. He was also sending some messages to Hong Yue, including asking her to dispatch more venerable sovereigns. Hong Yue had suffered heavy losses of advanced venerable sovereigns, but there were many middle venerable sovereigns.There were more than ten of them in Senlan, not to mention Crimson Moon.In addition, as an eighth-tier universe, there were countless venerable sovereigns who wanted to join Hong Yue.These B * stards actually dared to kill an eighth-level universe Supreme Emperor in public ... Even if they didn't reveal their identities, they were all discerning people. Why were they acting like fools? who didn't know that they were from the Crimson Moon?His heart was filled with anger, but he didn't say anything.As a rank four, he wasn't afraid of the myriad Dao sovereign.However, there were still many venerable sovereigns on the other side. If they joined forces, he, a rank four, could not fight against ten alone.It was possible for a fourth stage venerable sovereign to deal with two or three third stage venerable sovereigns, and he had a high chance of winning.But more than 10 ... They should just go to sleep. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Senlan temple.The apparitions of venerable sovereigns appeared.The realmlord was not present, and the host was another venerable sovereign of Senlan. He was the rather old rank six venerable sovereign that Ji Hao had mentioned, venerable sovereign Yan Fang. He was also the only rank six venerable sovereign of Senlan other than the realmlord.The hall was slightly noisy.The sounds continued.Someone looked angry and said in a low voice,""The people from the myriad DAOs sect are probably vassals of other macro worlds. They're here to provoke a direct conflict between us and the Crimson Moon. These people must be dealt with to prevent the Crimson Moon from officially turning against us!""What a joke! Hong Yue is an invader. Since she dared to invade Senlan, so what if there's something wrong with venerable sovereign of myriad Dao? Since they dare to kill people from the Crimson Moon, we'll support them!"‚Äã "It's not that simple. Now that we've killed a large number of Red Moon sovereign ... If ... I, Sen LAN, am really defeated, How do I explain it?""Explanation? Bullshit! What do we need to explain to Hong Yue? Are we the vassals of the Crimson Moon? We are the venerable sovereigns of the Senlan great world, not the venerable sovereigns of the Crimson Moon! That's an invader. Are you going to betray Senlan?""I'm just telling the truth. I can't ruin my future for a moment of courage ...""Hmph! The sector Lord had already said that this was a time of war, and in war, those who knelt and surrendered would not have a good ending! Only by making a name for myself on the battlefield can I be valued. Even if I can't hold on and choose to surrender in the end, I, Sen LAN, am not a nobody!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùSenlan's venerable sovereigns were divided into two sides. Some supported it, while some opposed it.Li Hao's group started to attack, which was beyond everyone's expectations.He had thought that he just wanted to draw them to his side so that they wouldn't cause trouble ... In the end, they really made a move, and four venerable sovereigns fell in one move. How terrifying was that?The noise continued.Even the venerable sovereigns were terrified at this moment. Some people were excited and should be killed!Sen LAN still had 12 middle stage venerable sovereigns. At this moment, other than the sector Lord and Ji Hao, they were all here.Of the 10 middle-stage venerable sovereigns, other than Yan Fang, the remaining nine were all insistent on their words.Thearch Yan Fang, who was in front, looked old.He didn't say anything.He was just trying to judge the realmlord's thoughts.Did the realmlord ... Wish for the myriad DAOs sect to exist?There was hope!If he didn't want to ... Today, regardless of whether those Wan Dao martial artists were new martial artists or not, the realm Lord would have an excuse to kill them and give Hong Yue an explanation. But now, he didn 't.It was obvious that the realmlord had the intention to let these people stir up some trouble.In the end ... If Red Moon really won and got Sen LAN, it would be fine if she didn't make trouble, but if she did, there would be a scapegoat.Of course, Yan Fang understood the realmlord's thoughts.If Hongyue didn't care and didn't make things difficult for her, Senlan could really draw so many venerable sovereigns to her side and strengthen her strength.The two sides were quarreling. Some of the former direct descendants of the path master were against Li Hao killing people and wanted to hand him over to Hong Yue to deal with ... It was normal. After the path master died, these people were terrified and worried that sector Lord Sen LAN would cause trouble.

Chapter 2883 I Want To Eat Fish (2)
Now, Hong Yue wanted to take them in. They would rather work for the Hong Yue sector Lord than to work for the Sen LAN sector Lord. This was all too normal.There were many direct descendants of the Dao master.Out of the nine middle stage venerable sovereigns present, five were direct descendants of the Dao master. The remaining four and Ji Hao were also five direct descendants of the sector Lord.After all, Dao Masters had some advantages.The master of the great Dao distributed the daosource and the power of the great Dao ... This was something that the realm Lord couldn't catch up with. Moreover, there were even more rank five experts supporting the Dao master.When forest orchid Dao master was still alive, he would naturally give his own people more support and care.Sector Lords could only barely raise their own people to the 4th level, 5th level was very rare.Out of the 4, only 1 was a sector Lord's direct descendant.And now, 3 rank 5s and 2 rank 4s were against it.He hoped that he could get rid of the myriad DAOs sect to prevent more trouble.At this moment, the realmlord's attitude was the key. The other person was this Imperial venerable Yan Fang, the other stage six Imperial venerable of Senlan. His status was very high and his strength was not weak. After the Dao Lord died, although the realmlord had seized the Dao universe, this person had also occupied a place in the Dao universe.At this moment, the Dao master's faction all looked at Yan Fang.When the Dao master was alive, Yan Fang was actually still biased towards the Dao master's faction.At this moment, as long as Yan Fang opened his mouth ... Even if the realm Lord wasn't willing, he wouldn't dare to oppose this branch at this time.Otherwise, half of the Senlan monarch would rebel."Old Yan, what are you thinking?"At this time, a rank five venerable sovereign looked at Yan Fang and said in a deep voice,""Under normal circumstances, a battle between venerable sovereigns is mainly for sparring. But now, the myriad DAOs sect's group has come to kill! Killing four venerable sovereigns in one day ... What was the difference between this and the fanatics of new martial arts? Outsiders don't know and think we've joined forces with neo martial ..."Yan Fang coughed lightly and shook his head,"don't speak nonsense!" The realm Lord has personally verified it. Since that's the case, the other party is not a neo martial artist. Besides, neo martial killed my Dao master. I, Sen LAN, will not rest until neo martial is dead ... Don't say this again. "Don't associate this group of people with neo martial!Even if they were related, Yan Fang was an old fox ... In Red moon's territory, as long as Red Moon got a hold of something, she would use the excuse of new martial arts invasion to attack directly. Then, Sen LAN would have no chance at all.He looked at the venerable sovereign and said softly,""No matter what everyone thinks, I, Sen LAN, will never be charged with colluding with neo martial! In the red moon region, this was a great taboo! Moreover, my Dao master died at the hands of neo martial ... In anyone's eyes, I, Senlan, can't possibly collude with neo martial ... Don't look for trouble for yourself. " The venerable sovereign who had spoken was stunned for a moment before he nodded.It was just a passing remark.Yan Fang was right. If Wan Dao and the others were to carry the identity of the new martial artists ... Then Sen LAN would be in big trouble. Although Hong Yue had an excuse, it might not be a bad thing ... However, it was a serious crime to join forces with the new martial artists to attack a Hong Yue person. At that time, perhaps many venerable sovereigns would have to die to appease Hong Yue's anger.Who could guarantee that they would not be the ones to die? Yan Fang then said softly,"our Sen LAN can lose, can lose ... But, as long as the Crimson Moon region is still controlled by the Crimson Moon world and is still called the Crimson Moon region, then we must not have any entanglement with neo martial ... Neo martial has killed many of the enemy's seventh rank venerable sovereigns. The Crimson Moon realm Lord is full of anger. Do you want to be the target of his anger?""We hired the myriad DAOs ... We've already hired them and killed them. The realm Lord has also verified it ... At this time, not to mention that they're not neo martial artists, even if they are ...""That's not it either!"The old man said coldly after a pause.Everyone present instantly became solemn!Even if it was, it wasn 't.They understood what the old man meant.Now, he didn't need to care about the identity of Wan Dao and the others. Even if they were really new martial artists, he had to clear their names and not say anything."We understand, old Yan!"  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã The fifth level venerable sovereign could only nod, but he was still a little unwilling.""But this group of people, if they continue to kill indiscriminately, it's very easy to get into big trouble!""Yes."Yan Fang nodded slightly,"but it's nothing. They were just a group of low level venerable sovereigns. The ones they killed were only low level venerable sovereigns! There were quite a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns in the forest world. Even if they kept killing, how many could they kill? Moreover, the Crimson Moon is definitely unwilling to give up. I think there are more people coming to help ..."After saying this, he smiled and said,"let's wait and see!" Everyone, don't be in a hurry to pick a side. What if I, Senlan, can really reach the seventh step on my own?"He looked at the people from the path master's faction and said meaningfully,""You have to understand that outsiders will always be outsiders. They have no achievements and are archenemies to the neo martial artists. Many rank-7s have died. If I join at this stage, everyone in a rank-8 world will admire me, including me. In fact, I would rather join a rank-8 world, but at this stage, do I dare to?""At this stage, aren't you afraid of becoming cannon fodder?" he chuckled."Unless you're as crazy as the myriad DAOs Academy! Wasn't Senlan's situation the same as Crimson Moon 's? Although it looked better since the red moon master was still here, don't forget that Yunxiao's Wu Shan had killed Hong Yu! The Son of God of light and the Silver Moon King are on good terms ... Two eighth-tier universes, one pinnacle seventh-tier universe, and three great worlds. What if they really join forces?"

Chapter 2884 I Want To Eat Fish (3)
Was Hong Yue really any better than Sen LAN? As a rank-6, he actually wanted to join a rank-8 great world. His chances of reaching rank-7 would be greater!In the past, he was actually a supporter of the Daoist master!But now ... Things were different.He didn't want to join now. Even if he joined the red moon now, he hoped that the sector Lord would enter the seventh stage. Only then would he, a sixth stage forest orchid, have a chance of becoming a seventh stage venerable sovereign in the red moon world.Otherwise, would Senlan have given birth to two tier 7 experts?Everyone understood what he meant.He supported the sector Lord!The venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed slightly. The two sixth-rank venerable sovereigns of Senlan had actually reached an agreement ... In this case, they could not say anything more.At this moment, the sector Lord's level 5 venerable sovereign was also overjoyed,""Old Yan, so you're saying that we should continue to support the myriad DAOs Academy?"Yan Fang pondered for a moment, then nodded slightly,""Appropriate support is still necessary! To suppress the arrogance of those outsiders! We'll try to suppress the middle-stage venerable sovereigns with the help of others ... Of course, this will also force the lower-stage wandering cultivators in the inner realm to join forces ... This way, the two sides will be in a stalemate, which can actually help us stabilize the situation in Senlan!"Someone from the path master's faction spoke again,'but the price for these people to kill venerable sovereigns is not low! "This time, I'm taking 160 million great Dao crystals. I've already taken 10 million. If I'm lucky, I can exchange 170 million great Dao crystals for two medium worlds!""Although Senlan's Foundation is rich, it's only a Tier 6 great world. Such consumption ..."Yan Fang chuckled,"they killed venerable sovereigns in exchange for money. Do you think venerable sovereigns are that easy to kill? Did they have that many to kill? Besides, the other party has more than ten venerable sovereigns, and they risked their lives to kill a venerable sovereign. If they're level one, it's only a million great Dao crystals ... The price isn't too high. We can't let them work without giving them any benefits, can we?"He didn't think the price was too high.It was just that killing too many at once made it seem a little too much.100 million was not a small number. Even for a medium venerable sovereign, it was a huge amount of wealth. However, the other side had many people.There wasn't much to be split.It was only a little over ten million. Which venerable sovereign present couldn't afford this amount?If you're capable, you can go and kill them too."Moreover, this is the first time ... Next, Senlan's venerable sovereigns will be prepared. They won't be so stupid as to be besieged and killed by them. For the first time, we can show the sincerity of Senlan by paying a price!"The venerable sovereigns thought for a while and said nothing.Spend some money then.  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao naturally didn't know about Sen Lan's meeting.However, when Qian Wuliang brought back those Dao crystals, Li Hao knew that Senlan had chosen to keep them.Otherwise, he wouldn't have given them so many Dao crystals.Otherwise, they would drag it out! The other party didn't delay or say that he wouldn't give it. Instead, he gave it very directly and straightforwardly. Without the approval of Senlan and the other two tier 6 experts, it was definitely impossible to take out such a large number of great Dao crystals." 170 million!"Li Hao smiled.Coincidentally, he had gained the same amount of rewards as he had killed the seventh rank venerable sovereign. However, the price he had paid and the risks he had taken were worlds apart!As expected, killing a tier 7 was the worst deal!Killing a Grade 7 expert ... If he wasn't an enemy ... It would be too much of a loss to kill him. It would be fine if he was a world Lord, but if he wasn 't, he would cry if he killed an Ordinary Grade 7.Of course, if he killed a level Seven with a great world and a great path universe, he would make a huge profit.The venerable sovereigns around the crack were also overjoyed.Li Hao glanced at the crowd and said,""We have gained a lot this time, but as you all know ... 100 million of them were given to Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and black Panther, which is equivalent to swallowing a medium-level world.""Of the remaining 70 million, I'll take 50 million. As for the remaining 20 million, we'll split it to use for daily cultivation."No one had any objections. It was completely understandable to give it to the two Dao Masters and the world Master.If they didn't level up, no matter how much they absorbed, it would all be for naught.They wanted these few to quickly reach Grade 3.In this way, Tian Ji and Xun RUO could directly enter the third rank. They were third rank venerable sovereigns to begin with, but they were restricted by the two Dao Masters.Heaven's Fate was also very straightforward."It's the same even if we don't absorb or cultivate. The consumption isn't big. I think we should just let them absorb it!"The other venerable sovereigns also expressed their opinions.As for Li Hao's share ... They didn't say anything. This person was at level four and wasn't affected by the great path universe. It would be best if he could reach level five."That's it for now. 100 million is enough for the three of them to absorb and digest for a period of time. Rank-3 isn't a difficult thing. From rank-1 to rank-3, it's just a process of accumulating energy!""I'm not sure," Li Hao said."If you can reach Level 3, you'll be able to better carry out your future plans."Qian Wuliang and the others all nodded.There was no way to resist!If they didn't enter the 3rd rank, the others wouldn't be able to. This wasn't the time to decline."You're right." Hong Yitang transmitted his voice."They're only checking on you now. If we enter stage three ... Will they check on us as well?"Li Hao had the ability to cover it up, but they couldn 't.Moreover, they were also the Masters of the great Dao.Once they entered the other party's Dao universe, the DAOs of both sides might have a great conflict.

Chapter 2885 I Want To Eat Fish (3)
He had been exposed!Before, Li Hao was at the front, so sector Lord Sen LAN didn't care about them. But now, he couldn 't."I'm fine!"Li Hao sent a voice transmission, the opponent is only in control of a somewhat broken sixth-level great Dao universe! Later on, if you really advance, give me the Dao River and I'll give you the Dao of a small realm ... That will do! I can temporarily take in the river of the path, and there won't be any mistakes. "Li Hao could temporarily control the Dao River and the Dao universe.If Time and Stars could still be turned back, then he could continue to control the great Dao universe.However, Li Hao couldn't completely control it now.After the two of them entered the venerable sovereign level, their compatibility with the great Dao universe was very high. It would be difficult for Li Hao to fully control it without the cooperation of the two.Unless he killed the two of them.However, the two of them agreed that it would not be a problem for them to use the time star for a while. As for the time star, as long as it was not too excessive and they had the underhand technique, the chaos lightning tribulation would not appear.Moreover, the true Dao universe was actually not here. They only controlled the river of ten thousand DAOs, and the true Dao universe was actually on the other side of the Silvermoon world.Hong Yitang felt more at ease after hearing what he said.  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Otherwise, if they were exposed, there would be no other way."Then ... Everyone is very wary of us. Do we still continue to kill?""Wait!"Li Hao said,"we'll talk about it after we've digested our gains!" Wouldn't it be a waste ... If he didn't digest these gains? After digesting the gains, we'll deal with them one by one!""Alright!"No one said anything else. Soon, all the Dao crystals were distributed by Li Hao. The two Dao Masters each received 50 million Dao crystals. Since the others didn't want them, Li Hao didn't hold back. He gave the remaining 20 million to Black Panther. Black Panther was a world Lord, and he had long since reached rank two. Last time, he had devoured the body of a rank three venerable sovereign. Now that he had more, rank three should not be a problem.Silvermoon had already entered the mid-level world level.These people should not have such strength.What he lacked was energy.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao himself didn't stay idle, either.Fifty million great Dao crystals was not a small number. It was enough for him to further perfect the development of his small worlds. In addition, he had to give some to Lin Hongyu, who cultivated the Dao of life and death ... Li Hao did not expect Lin Hongyu to develop many Dao of life and death by herself. He thought that Lin Hongyu should just follow the steps.Just learn from me!Building a bridge between life and death.Not to mention other things, if he successfully built 360 bridges, even a stage three great circle of perfection among life and death monarchs would not be considered weak. Lin Hongyu's state ... Was equivalent to the emptiness of the past.You have an eighth-rank father who can arrange the path for you. Follow my path, so there won't be too many shackles.Li Hao was now a level four venerable sovereign, and the river of Dao was strong enough to support Lin Hongyu to reach level three.Other than them ... There was one more person.Zhang an!Zhang an was not even a venerable sovereign yet. He was still cultivating two DAOs, one of which was the Silver Moon Dao, and the other was the origin Dao. He was currently in seclusion in the Dao River.Unable to become a venerable sovereign for so long ... It had to be said that he seemed a little useless.Li Hao calculated for a moment. He planned to have a detailed chat with Zhang an after he absorbed and digested these great Dao crystals.The grandson of a Supreme martial artist was well-informed, so it was not difficult for him to become a venerable sovereign.It was just that Zhang an ... Although he looked refined and aloof from worldly affairs, he was actually quite ambitious. He had always insisted on not giving up on the cultivation of the book of Dao. Otherwise, he would have become a venerable sovereign long ago.The new martial's origin Dao and the Silver Moon's new Dao were compatible, but they weren't too compatible. If they didn't give up on either side, it would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens for them to merge the orthodoxies of the two different great Dao universes and enter the venerable sovereign level.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On this day, Li Hao didn't care about how the outside world was wary and how they judged him.He began to cultivate his own path.The long river in the long sword shook. Li Hao once again opened some small realms. Although they were small, they were his foundations. One day, the Dao in the long river turned into realms, and each realm could grow stronger ... That would be the time when his Dao was complete.As for when he could enter the fifth step, Li Hao was not in a hurry.Be it Level 4 or Level 6, in Li Hao's eyes, it was a process of laying a foundation. As long as there were enough boundaries and Changhe was strong enough, he could naturally reach Level 5 or even Level 6 during this process!Of course, there was not much hope for him to reach the seventh step.According to him, even if he were to comprehend yin and yang and time at the sixth step ... It would still be difficult for him to advance.Perhaps it would only work if all the worlds were complete. Moreover, the worlds might have to merge and construct an entire great world before they could successfully advance to Level Seven. Li Hao himself didn't know when that would happen.In the past, he thought that he would be able to reach the seventh rank, but now ... He just had to wait.The long river in the firmament sword rippled.Little realms ... Even Li Hao himself was too embarrassed to call them that. Little domains ... Small dark rooms began to appear.50 million great Dao crystals could be exchanged for five small worlds!It was clear that the energy in these great Dao crystals was extremely rich.But on Li Hao's side ... Every small world was being replenished a little, and the river was being replenished a little. These small worlds were all maintained for a breath's time, maintaining the breathing technique's operation. The consumption was enormous!

Chapter 2886 I Want To Eat Fish (1)_5
Li Hao sometimes felt that he was asking for trouble by copying chaos and creating worlds.With such a consumption and the inability to completely absorb energy from the chaos ... When would he be able to cultivate these things into a true realm?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the river.Second cat looked on silently. Recently, it actually didn't sleep much. Most of the time, it was stabilizing the river.As the boundaries increased, Li Hao's River began to lose balance. He needed an expert to suppress the river. Li Hao didn't have the time and energy, so he could only ask for help from er Mao.Recently, second cat had been a little annoyed.However, it was the one who had agreed to it, saying that it was a small matter ... Only after it had done it did it realize that it was too troublesome.Even a cat in the pugilistic world had no choice.However, looking at the little realms appearing one by one, er Mao's eyes revealed some joy.But ... There was a problem.It was only a second level venerable sovereign now. It was actually a little difficult for it to suppress Changhe with such strength. Although Li Hao was still a fourth level venerable sovereign, he was actually advancing on the road to that level.At this rate, Level 5 and Level 6 would definitely not become Li Hao's shackles.At that time, if the river was still not stable ... It would probably be difficult for it to suppress it."Big cat, have you reached the peak of the seventh step? I think he's almost at the eighth step?"But...Until now, it was only as strong as it was in the past. In fact, it was quite powerful in that space of the past. It was equivalent to the Emperor of that era.At that time, it was very powerful.But now ... In the chaos, a rank two cat was not strong enough."Cats ... Aren't here to fight."Er Mao mumbled to himself. He looked at Lin Hongyu who was using the Qi of life and death to train himself. These people were all cultivating and improving themselves. Only er Mao had been sleeping after he was revived. It was as if he had never cultivated."But my ... Cultivation method is different from theirs."Second cat thought and looked at the newly born Jie.Walk the path of a big cat?That was not what it wanted.The big cat was also him ... But it was no longer him.Bigcat is bigcat. Bigcat has walked his own path, and I ... I don't think I should learn from bigcat and follow bigcat's path. Otherwise, bigcat carries the world of yin and yang. Second cat feels that if I ask to help Li Hao carry this long river ... Li Hao will probably be willing, right?But if I did that, I would be a copy of big cat.Although it originated from the big cat, second cat didn't want to live like a big cat. Just like the blood Emperor, he didn't want to live like a war. War, he didn't want anyone to live like him."I am the past and the future ... I was born in time ... I was born in the illusion ..."In fact, second cat always knew where he should go.However, sometimes, she didn't really want to go.The thoughts in its heart were far more complicated than what bigcat was thinking.The big cat would never think about such nonsense. Although it was extremely strong and looked fierce, the big cat ... Actually lived a very pure life. The human King had actually taken good care of it. At most, it would fight and eat fish. As for other things, it seemed that everything was still the same as before.In fact, it wasn't the big cat that had changed, but me.Second cat thought to himself. It had never been the big cat that had changed. The big cat was still the same as before ... However, in the big cat's eyes, killing people was just like a cat eating fish. It was no big deal.I, on the other hand, am really different."Li Hao!"A shadow appeared in the river. Li Hao was busy creating some small realms. Hearing the shout, the shadow appeared in front of second cat. He asked,""Senior, is there something you need?"Second cat would rarely take the initiative to find him.Do you want to sleep?He felt that suppressing the river was a little tiring?It can't be, right?Second cat looked at Li Hao and was silent for a while. Then it said,""I want to eat fish!"Fish?Li Hao was startled and shuddered. Dried fish, I know what it is."Senior ... This ... How about this, I'll go back and kill a few and make dried fish ..."Second cat rolled its eyes. Its huge eyes were filled with speechlessness and disdain. "I'm not a big cat!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhat did that mean?Second cat was silent for a while before saying,""I'm an illusion, can you understand?"Li Hao was stunned for a moment, then nodded.  n0vel 0nline free at‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  He knew.Two cats was just a part of the Cang Emperor's past. Zhan Tiandi used a Supreme technique to pull out a part of the past and bring it into reality, thus making two cats.To be honest, even Li Hao was confused and shocked by this method. How could it be done?Illusion...That was true."Then senior's meaning is ...""I'm an illusory being, not a real life form that exists in the chaos!"Second cat said softly,"an illusory thing is needed to nourish me. It needs an illusory spirit!" My best food is pure life force ...""Killing and extracting life force ..." Li Hao said."No!"Second cat was a little annoyed. This idiot, why is he the same as the human King?Why did they only have one thought, to kill?It was a little annoyed."It's not this kind of life force. The life force of a cultivator is just a drop in the ocean! Do you understand?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was stunned. Why are you acting cute?Second cat quickly recovered his original tone and said,"Do you know which place in the primordial chaos has the purest and densest life force?"

 "The world!" Li Hao said after some thought."Right!"Second cat nodded."Also, do you know what kind of world has the richest life force and the best food?""A great world?""Wrong!"Second cat shook its head,"it's a new world!" Do you know why I was able to recover?"Li Hao's eyes flickered."The moment a world advances, life force is born. Or rather, the Silver Moon is a new world from the beginning. Senior has been extracting the power of the Silver Moon ...""Right!"Second cat nodded his head,"that's why I want to eat fish, the pure fish of life!" I'm not an omnivorous cat like the big cat, who eats everything. I want to eat the purest life force and turn my illusory body into reality!""I'm actually not complete right now. I've only been resurrected, and I haven't truly descended from the past to the present ..."Li Hao kept thinking. After a long time, he said,""Then senior's meaning is to find some new worlds and extract the world power from them. This is the fish that senior wants?"The difficulty ... Was much higher than Emperor Cang.Emperor Cang ate everything. Killing a venerable sovereign and making dried fish. Emperor Cang ate it with great relish. So ... Er Mao was so picky!Li Hao had a headache!He had to agree to second cat's request. From the beginning, he had borrowed a lot of things from second cat. He had asked second cat to help him many times and said that it was his last time every time.As for second cat, he didn't have any desires. Other than holding time star, he didn't make any requests.Li Hao had also been thinking about how to repay the favor.Today, second cat made a request and he felt a headache.Where could he find a new world?It was rare!Moreover, the new worlds were hidden in the depths of chaos. The chaos blinded them, making it impossible for people to detect them. This was a rule of chaos that protected the new worlds, just like the Silver Moon. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Second cat nodded and said,"this new world Energy is the best!" However, it's not like there's nothing to replace it ...""There's a substitute?"Li Hao was delighted."Yes, I am.""The source of the world!"Li Hao knew that every world had its own origin, just like the origin of the great DAOs. In the previous two-Dao universe, the origin of the great DAOs was Time and Stars.Of course, that was not the case anymore.Now, the source of the great DAOs in the two-Dao universe was the river of great DAOs of the two Dao Masters."The source of the world ... Any size is fine?""Anything is fine!"Second cat nodded."It doesn't taste as good as the power of the New World, but the effect is similar. However, I can only absorb a part of it. I don't need the messy impurities. Big cat eats everything. I only eat the pure source."Li Hao smiled bitterly.A picky cat is not a good cat.However, since second cat had made a request, he was relieved. It was a good thing."This ... Is fine!"Li Hao nodded."I have a small world. It was given to me before, but I haven't used it yet. After I'm done observing its structure, I'll dismantle the small world and let senior absorb the origin inside ...""I want a lot!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùA small world could be sold for 10 million great Dao crystals outside. Most importantly, it was not something that could be bought just because one wanted to. Moreover, small worlds were actually quite in short supply. Under normal circumstances, only rank three venerable sovereigns would buy them."Senior, how much do you want to eat?""Let's try 10 of them,"second cat said, wagging its tail.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùTen worlds?There weren't many small worlds. If he could buy one, 100 million would be enough.More importantly ... He might not be able to buy it!"If you eat ten fish, I can help you with something. You won't lose anything," second cat said. "What?"Li Hao didn't really care if he made a loss or not. In fact, it wasn't a loss. He had bought a small world, and ER Mao had only eaten the source. Li Hao could analyze the structure of the world, and the rest of the things were given to the two Dao Masters and the Black Panther. It wasn't a loss.However, it was hard to buy.Besides, second cat helped him before, and now he's about to eat fish ... How can I be more stingy than the human King?The human King would feed Emperor Cang anything good, so how could I be stingy?Second cat looked at Li Hao and mumbled,""You'd better eat your fill, I'll filter the river of Dao for you. ""What?"Second cat looked at Li Hao again and said,"didn't you go to neo martial?" Don't you know what the nature of a big cat is?"Li Hao was stunned. He tried to recall.The next moment, he was enlightened!What was the essence of Emperor Cang?Emperor Cang was actually a trash can specially created by the heavenly Emperor in the past to filter the filth in the source world. The source universe also had some impurities and bad things, but the great Dao universe had them all.The celestial Thearch was also an outstanding talent. Emperor Cang was actually used to purify the entire universe of origin!His expression changed as he looked at second cat.Second cat was a little unhappy and mumbled,"What are you looking at? I was also projected by the big cat. If the big cat can do it, I can do it too! I'm just too lazy to help you. If you eat your fill ... Your River may look pure, but it's actually a mess. I'll help you purify it, and your River will be truly pure!"Li Hao's eyes were filled with joy!Second cat can help me purify the entire River?Just eating fish?As for being too lazy to help me ... That's not important.Right now, Li Hao's River was indeed very chaotic. In addition, it had been in an explosive period and was constantly changing its path. Li Hao had to sort it out every time because it was too chaotic!But if second cat helped me clean it up and purify it, Li Hao would save a lot of time."Just ten small worlds?""Eat ten fish and I'll purify you once!"Li Hao didn't care. One purification was enough. At least, it could be maintained for a long time without disorder. He was instantly overjoyed."Alright, I'll think of a way immediately. I wonder if Senlan has enough small worlds. If there are, I ... I'll ask for small worlds next time!""Yes, that's it!"Second cat ignored him. It turned around, wagged its tail at Li Hao, and lazily swam along the river.His eyes were slightly dazed.Am I going to descend into the true chaos?If it absorbed too much vitality, it would become a true creature of chaos. In fact, it had a great advantage that Li Hao didn't know about. It was immortal!Even if it was dead, the blood Emperor could resurrect it with some means.It was the same now. Even if they died, they could be resurrected again, just like in the past.However, if they were completely turned into living beings ... If they died and wanted to be resurrected, it would be like resurrecting other venerable sovereigns ... It was as difficult as ascending to heaven.It was no longer a small world that could be resurrected after some nurturing.Second cat didn't know why it wanted to eat fish.Perhaps, he missed the taste of the fish of life?Perhaps, he saw that the big cat had a lot of fish and even had his own small fish pond, but I didn 't?Perhaps ... It was because he was gradually trying to integrate into this world?Do you think I'll forget about teaching?It won 't!However, the teacher would never come back.With his butt facing Li Hao, he didn't look at the happy Li Hao. Young people were always so boisterous. Teachers weren't like this, teachers were never like this ... Li Hao was just not as good as a teacher.It gently wagged its tail and a faint time star appeared in front of it. Holding the small time star, it rested its head on the star and entered a dream.Teacher, I might ... Not miss you anymore.Drip, drip, drip. Large drops of tears fell and flowed into the long river. He didn't know why he was crying. Perhaps, when the Silver Moon revives, this will be my fate?Behind them, Li Hao turned his head and was slightly stunned. For a long time, he didn't make a sound.

Chapter 2888 Kill Without Mercy!
Li Hao watched as second cat left and disappeared into the river.Perhaps the blood Emperor's decision to revive the two cats was wrong.Perhaps the blood Emperor knew something about the Silver Moon, and he hoped to make up for it. However, he had miscalculated. The resurrected cat two might not even want him to be resurrected.Today, second cat was going to eat fish.He was going to cultivate!Li Hao returned to reality and thought to himself,"cultivation ... To me, it's a pleasure, but to second cat, it's a pleasure, right?"It knew where its path was, how strong it should be, and how it could become a real living being ... But before this, it had never mentioned it, not until today.Why?Was it because ... The appearance of the embryonic form of the myriad world had made second cat feel something?Was it the recovery of time?Li Hao thought silently.,m He knew that second cat didn't cultivate for him. Maybe ... He just wanted to see the deceased teacher again. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  A real look!Pull that person out from the depths of time and tell him that it's time for him to wake up. It's time for him to ... Take a look!Is there really nothing in this world that is worth your nostalgia?He abandoned these thoughts.He had to be satisfied when he ate fish.Second cat had never asked for anything, whether it was for cultivation or to satisfy its appetite. Since it had asked, Li Hao would definitely satisfy it.Ten small worlds?He had one on hand, so he was still short of nine small worlds. Small worlds? did the forest orchid world have them?There should be!After all, it was a big world ... Which big world in the chaos didn't eat people?There were so many small worlds, but Li Hao hadn't encountered many of them. Or rather, he didn't care much about small worlds, but that didn't mean that others hadn't encountered them after so many years.They might not be seized, but traded, offered, and other methods.Some small world Lords might take the initiative to offer their world to a large world.For the sake of protection, for the sake of resources, for the sake of other things, for the sake of Daoist techniques, for the sake of joining a great world ... All these were possible.A small world could help a person quickly advance between rank one and rank three. It could help a rank three venerable sovereign have a glimmer of hope of devouring and advancing to the middle rank. Of course, the chances were very small."Senior Huai King!"Not far away, King Huai quickly stood up and flew over.Li Hao was very polite to them, addressing them as seniors, but Huai King did not dare to be arrogant. He was polite, but he was also ruthless. The venerable sovereigns of Silver Moon were very respectful to him, so how could he take advantage of his seniority?"The Silver Moon King ...""You don't have to call me that.""Just call me by my name," Li Hao interrupted. King Huai smiled but did not reply."Senior celestial pole and senior celestial pole abandoned their origins to join me in times of crisis," Li Hao said."You should've thought twice before you acted, but the situation is urgent ... Now that senior celestial pole's realm has fallen, it's a great loss for both of you ...""What are you saying?" King Huai hurriedly replied,"we're a family, so it's only right. "Li Hao was just being polite. He quickly said,""Qian Wuliang and the others are cultivating. I need to trouble you to help me run a few errands.""Just give the order," King Huai was overjoyed and hurriedly said.It was good that he had something to do.Before lying down, they still had to work. It was not life-threatening work. Even if it was life-threatening work, they had to do it in the early stages. After doing the work and making contributions, they could lie down on the merit book to eat, drink, pee, and sleep. At that time, no one would care.He had been lying flat for a thousand years after making a contribution to neo martial arts. This time, he should lie down for a longer time, right?"First, go to Senlan and ask if they have more small worlds and medium worlds. I want to exchange them for these next time I kill a venerable sovereign."King Huai remembered it and nodded."Second, find the wandering cultivators. Threaten them or threaten them, no matter what ... Convey my orders. Leave Senlan as soon as possible. It's the best result for them to gather together. "King Huai's heart trembled slightly. Did he deliberately let them gather?Catch them all in one fell swoop?His heart was quite black!"Understood!"King Huai nodded. This was not difficult. To him, what kind of trouble was this?The two things were simple.He continued to wait. In fact, he hoped that he could do more difficult things so that he could show his value."The third ..."Li Hao paused for a moment and slowly said,""If ... And I'm saying if ..."He looked at King Huai and sent a voice transmission,"if there are any changes in the situation, can senior do me a favor with your reputation?"King Huai's heart trembled at Li Hao's words.What was it?"Silver Moon King, please speak!"What kind of reputation?What reputation do I have?I have a bad reputation and I'm notorious for being a servant of three families. I'm a notorious person in neo martial arts. On Silver moon's side, who was the first person that they thought of when a neo martial artist betrayed them?General Huai!Why?This was because general Huai's ancestor was King Huai's monstrous plant companion. One had to know that he was only the descendant of the monstrous plant companion. In the end, the first person that came to his mind was general Huai. Wasn't that tragic?His heart skipped a beat. He had a feeling that it was not simple.Sure enough, Li Hao said telepathically, I may not be able to hide it from the top existences. Moreover, in the later stages, the red moon may not recruit me, and my identity may even be exposed ... If there is a risk of being exposed, senior, you can sneak up on me, kill me, seize my sword, and offer it to the red moon Lord!

2889 Chapter 476
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùËâπ!King Huai cursed in his heart. This ... Was asking for his life!"Senior's reputation is out there, you're not strong, and you know neo martial like the back of your hand ... When the time comes, if we directly sell out Silver Moon and neo martial, the other party will definitely not kill senior and will instead give birth to him! A second stage venerable sovereign, and a neo martial venerable sovereign at that. He might also be the first neo martial venerable sovereign that Hong Yue captured ... He's not a captive, but he took the initiative to join them. Under the situation where neo martial killed several of their seventh stage, it can be imagined that Hong Yue needs a neo martial venerable sovereign as a flag to restore her prestige!""Senior, this is very suitable ... The other party won't even think too much or suspect anything. Even if they suspect ... They won't care too much. Second level venerable sovereigns often betray ... These words are a little unpleasant, please don't take it to heart, senior."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùKing Huai was helpless.Is my reputation really that bad?"Silver Moon King's meaning is ... If there's any danger, I'll ... I'll kill you, take the sword, and give it to you?""Right!"Li Hao explained,"I'm saying that if there's an unexpected situation, I'm confident that I can hide it from sector Lord Sen LAN, but I'm definitely not confident that I can hide it from a level eight venerable sovereign!" So, when that time comes ... Senior can be the bad guy for once. After all, other than senior, no one else is suitable to be the bad guy!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t   ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThese words ...King Huai was helpless. How much better is the celestial pole than me?Your subordinate, Qian Wuliang, is also a man with many thoughts.There were also three venerable sovereigns from the outside ... Wasn't it normal for them to stab you in the back?Why must it be me?Alright ... I know, I have a bad reputation!He was helpless!"But if that happens ... What about the others?"He wasn't sure if Li Hao would die, but since he dared to say so, it was highly unlikely.What about the others?Could he be resurrected after being killed?"When that time comes, I'll just cover the path River and replace the great Dao for you. It won't be a big problem if you're killed, but it'll be best if you're not."Anyway, I said, this is just in case ... Senior, don't do it for no reason ..."The Huai King laughed dryly. How could that be?This person, how could he think of me like this?What a bad person!"I understand!"Huai King nodded. This Silver Moon King was thinking too much. He didn't seem as confident as a human King. If he was a human King, he would definitely believe that he had succeeded and that he could hide from everyone. However, Silver Moon King wasn't like that.He's thinking of failure, even including me."You and I both know about this ... There's no need to tell the others!""Understood!""Senior won't mind, right?""Of course I won 't!"The Huai King laughed dryly. How could that be?Although you've misunderstood me, I can do this for the sake of the plan. Is it dangerous? It was definitely dangerous.Although Li Hao said that the red moon would use him as a signboard ... But what if she did?What if they think that I don't deserve to live?Who could say for sure?"That's all for now, senior, you can go. "King Huai didn't say much and quickly left to contact Sen LAN and those wandering cultivators.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶This time, everyone cultivated for a while.After devouring so many great Dao crystals, the two Dao Masters, including Black Panther, felt that they were about to advance. However, they were still a little lacking. This time, they were not lacking in energy.It was a kind of explosive power. Perhaps, they would be able to break through in the next battle.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The forest world was also slightly shaken.King Huai had indeed been traveling around these few days. He had also threatened and bribed the wandering venerable sovereigns. He had used Sen Lan's name and the prestige of killing four venerable sovereigns to be extremely arrogant!He was acting like a Lackey, threatening the venerable sovereigns to either let them leave or force them to join the myriad Dao sovereign.This also provoked the resistance of the other venerable sovereigns!Some of the independent venerable sovereigns were unwilling to leave and began to form an alliance in secret. They were worried that they would be killed by this group of people. After all, they even dared to kill Hong Yue's people. For a time, the scattered venerable sovereigns began to join forces.There were many wandering venerable sovereigns in the forest world. Not only were there low-rank venerable sovereigns, but there were also a few middle-rank venerable sovereigns.Under the influence of King Huai's savagery, the wandering cultivators soon formed an unstable Alliance. More than 20 venerable sovereigns joined the Alliance. Among them, there were even two fourth stage venerable sovereigns.As a result, the individual cultivators instantly became more courageous. When King Huai went to intimidate them again ... They were almost killed!If it weren't for the fact that he didn't want to fight to the end with Li Hao's group ... King Huai would have almost died.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The forest world, underground.Kong Ji was very bored. He glanced at venerable sword, who was meditating next to him ... After entering Senlan with him, he didn't do anything and just waited. In the outside world, Li Hao seemed to have made a big move, but venerable sword was still waiting.What were they waiting for?Kong Ji couldn't hold back his heart. Ever since he had tried to kill a level 7 by joining forces, he really wanted to try ... How it felt to launch a surprise attack on a great world again!"Are you anxious?"Venerable the sword suddenly opened his eyes and chuckled,""No, I didn 't,"How was that possible?I'm not in a hurry!Venerable the sword laughed,"there's no hurry!" Let's wait a little longer. "Still waiting?Kong Ji thought about it. "The longer we drag this out, the higher the chances of sector Lord Sen LAN controlling the Sen LAN great Dao universe. The higher the chances of him reaching Level 7!"Now, if they worked together, they still had some confidence.
