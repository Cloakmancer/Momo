They had already started fighting, so who would care about your background?They were still a little apprehensive before they even started fighting, but now that things had come to this ... If he said that, it would only confirm their intention to silence them. "Rank three?"Heaven's Fate didn't care. He just shouted a few times and didn't really think that the other party would let him off.At this moment, I heard some news. My true body is at the third stage. Not bad!In any case, 100000 years ago, no, more than 50 years ago, he should only be at the second rank. Now, his main body has actually entered the third rank. It seems that in the past 50 years, his main body has also fought!He just didn't know if he had just entered 3rd rank or if he was at the peak of 3rd rank. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 At this moment, he was still in the mood to let his thoughts run wild.The next moment, he was hit by another Thunderbolt. His avatar was cracking. However, they were both low-level venerable sovereigns after all. Although he was at a disadvantage, it was still okay. Lin Hongyu's body, on the other hand, was already badly damaged.The aura of death scattered, and he turned into half a dead spirit.Even so, it was still difficult to resist the attack of a venerable sovereign. The first stage venerable sovereign's attacks became more ruthless. A wave of saber intent overflowed from his body. The other party was also a weapon cultivator.The blade tore through the void. Lin Hongyu could not Dodge it and was almost cut in half. Although it was not completely broken, countless cracks appeared on her body and she looked like she was about to collapse.On the other side, Qian Wuliang was in a frenzy.He was even more afraid than Lin Hongyu!F * cking hell, it's fine if they kill us, but if they kill Lin Hongyu ... No matter how Li Hao thought about his relationship with Lin Hongyu, all the Silver Moon citizens knew that she was the Marquis's wife.After the battle, the others might be fine, but if this person died ... How was he going to explain to Li Hao when he returned?He was a real ruthless man!Yes, in the eyes of others, Li Hao was a refined and elegant young man, but in the eyes of Qian Wuliang, he was a ruthless man.Li Hao had countless enemies in the huge Silver Moon.But now ... Can you even find one?Not a single one!From top to bottom, from strong to weak, and even the weakest, almost no one was hostile to Li Hao. He always killed his enemies casually, as if no one cared about him!Those who were slightly hostile toward Li Hao were all killed by him at Silver Moon.Not a single one was left!Some of the weaker ones had been attracted by the Holy white cult, and then ... The Holy white cult was gone.This was true ruthlessness.Qian Wuliang didn't dare to watch Lin Hongyu being killed.At this moment, he was determined. Even if the others died, he would be punished by Li Hao, but the people around Li Hao could not die!The next moment, this second level venerable sovereign who had merged with Hong Yitang suddenly did something shocking!In an instant, countless life forces appeared in the long river of the great path."No!" Hong Yitang's voice instantly appeared."No!"Qian Wuliang ignored him. He was currently extracting the life force of countless cultivators. As someone who wielded the great Dao, he had the ability to do so. He didn't extract much from the billions of cultivators in Silvermoon. He only extracted some from each of them. With billions of living beings gathered, the amount of life force he extracted was much more!In an instant, countless life forces emerged.In the next moment, Hong Yitang's voice sounded again,""You ...""Shut up!"At this moment, Qian Wuliang didn't pay any attention to him. In an instant, countless death Qi filled the air, and countless people died in the entire Silvermoon world.Some people who were attached to the aura of death might be old, or their lifespans might be running out, or they might be so sick that they couldn't be cured ... Anyway, people who were about to die all had the aura of death attached to them, but there was still hope for them to return to life.However, Qian Wuliang didn't care about them.In the blink of an eye, countless life force and death energy gathered and merged together, shooting towards Lin Hongyu in the distance.Lin Hongyu, who was about to be killed, suddenly felt countless life force and death Qi converging into her body. In the blink of an eye, her previous injuries were instantly healed. Her expression changed slightly.He turned his head and saw Qian Wuliang was already engaged in a fierce battle with the level three venerable sovereign. Qian Wuliang didn't care about what was happening on the other side and just complained in his heart,"I tried my best!"If this matter was known by others, he would not have a good end.But ... It was still better than watching Lin Hongyu get killed.Hong Yitang only sighed and didn't say anything.Could the master of the great Dao be fair and just?Obviously not.In Qian Wuliang's eyes, no matter how many people died, it was fine as long as Li Hao's close friends didn't die. As for Hong Yitang, although he felt that it was inappropriate, he didn't say anything at this moment.This move also caused his opponent, the rank three venerable sovereign Xun Feng, to change his expression slightly.The next moment, he was pleasantly surprised!Was this the Dao master?However, a newly-born Dao universe could control 10000 DAOs and gather life and death. Dao Masters were almost truly undying and indestructible. There was no longer any limit to their lifespan. That was because when one was about to die, one could completely extract 10000 DAOs of vitality.This was the Dao master!At that moment, the third rank venerable sovereign was both excited and fanatical.……At the same time.On the other side, a long-haired venerable sovereign looked in a direction and frowned slightly.There seemed to be some great Dao fluctuations!Was someone fighting?At this moment, Li Hao was not here. He did, and he did not know the other party, but he could recognize the power of the great Dao on the other party. It was the power of the Crimson Moon.The last time they escaped, a fourth stage venerable sovereign came to the Crimson Moon world.However, he did not leave the range of the Crimson Moon.

2731 Chapter 452
Although Silver Moon had disappeared for a year, this rank four venerable sovereign had not returned to the red moon. His current main mission was to capture Silver Moon experts and take over the Silver Moon world. Thus, he had been staying here for the past year.At this moment, he felt some fluctuations. After thinking for a while, he quickly moved in that direction.Although it was at the edge of the Crimson Moon, it was still within its range.He was more courageous. If he wasn't within the red moon's range, even if he sensed it, he might not go. Recently, new martial had attacked Red Moon and its allies more often.……Li Hao frowned.In the long river, the Stars of Life and death flickered. They had been showing signs of extinguishing, but suddenly, they began to fill up again.This meant that Lin Hongyu had almost died, but she had absorbed a large amount of life and death power to recover.This also meant danger!The situation was getting out of control.He was still some distance away from the Silver Moon world. The chaos was too big. Even though he felt that he was not far away and his speed was as fast as a level four venerable sovereign, he was still a little inferior and could not make it.To arrive at the last moment ... This was not something Li Hao wanted to see.He preferred to plan in advance so that he was 90% sure of his plan.With a thought, a corpse appeared. In an instant, the corpse began to melt and a time energy surrounded it. The power of a rank five venerable sovereign began to recover.In the next second, Li Hao crawled into the corpse and grabbed it. The corpse seemed to come to life and grabbed Ming Hao and the others. Li Hao's voice was heard."Follow me!"Ming Hao's expression changed drastically!Fifth rank?How could he use the power of a corpse so easily? this was clearly a dead venerable sovereign. Logically speaking, one could only absorb the energy of a dead venerable sovereign, but not use the other party's energy.This was completely different!You can absorb and refine it, but you can't make all the power of the fifth rank into your own. If that's the case ... Anyone can casually bring a high-tier venerable sovereign's body and become an advanced venerable sovereign himself.Ming Hao felt that it was a little unbelievable, but at the same time, he also felt ... A little shocked and fortunate.The other party might really have the ability to kill him in an instant.Of course, it was impossible to reach the fifth step, but since it could instantly transform into the fifth step, then what about the sixth step?What about the seventh-rank?In any case, he didn't dare to think about it.With the power of the fifth step, Li Hao's speed instantly increased. However, at this moment, dark clouds seemed to appear above his head. Borrowing the power of the fifth step seemed to trigger the chaos lightning tribulation.Li Hao didn't look at it, nor did he care.Even if borrowing it this time would cause some of the corpse's power to slip away, causing the Dao chess to be unable to be activated ... So what?There were still several venerable sovereigns there, right?Were the corpses of a few venerable sovereigns enough?If it's not enough, I'll kill more!As long as he killed many, he would not have to worry about not having enough energy to activate the Dao chess.With the power of the fifth step, his speed was much faster.A normal person shouldn't be doing this at this moment. The power of the fifth step was considered a life-saving asset and a trump card. Before the enemy could see it, his trump card had already been revealed ... But was Li Hao considered a normal person?He felt that he was very normal, but in the eyes of others, he was obviously not.At this moment, he was extremely fast.With the power of the fifth step, he could even vaguely feel that there was indeed someone following behind him. The distance was a little far, but he could still vaguely sense it. The other party might have also sensed him.Of course, he might not be certain.Li Hao didn't care about that. Since he had already triggered the chaos lightning tribulation, he didn't care anymore. In the river of life and death, time stars appeared again and accelerated!The speed was even faster! In an instant, he had even shaken off the people who were following him.Minghao couldn't help but swallow his saliva.What kind of power was this?Was this also a type of great Dao?Speed?Or something else?He didn't know. He only knew that Li Hao's current speed was beyond his imagination. It was faster than some level five venerable sovereigns he knew. Perhaps, he had caught up to level six?The other venerable sovereigns were even more shocked.What grade was this person in front of him?……Li Hao galloped faster.At this moment, Lin Hongyu was defeated again. However, her eyes lit up. That feeling ... He was getting closer and closer. He was about to return!He should have sensed that we're in danger.As expected, this person would never disappoint.No matter how difficult it is, no matter how far it is, when we are in danger, he will appear in front of us at the first moment."He'll be back soon!"Lin Hongyu shouted.At this moment, the morale of the several venerable sovereigns, who were seriously injured and in a state of decline, suddenly rose!Li Hao was coming back!Even though Li Hao was only Level 1 when he left and didn't seem to change anything, Qian Wuliang, Black Panther, and even Heaven's Fate were all shocked at this moment.He was coming back!They had been feeling hopeless and helpless, but now, they were suddenly overjoyed and exploded with joy.This shocked the venerable sovereigns!Supreme Emperor smoked wind, who was suppressing Qian Wuliang's great Dao River, sneered with a serious expression.""Who are you trying to scare?"Are you trying to scare me?"You're dead! The Silver Moon King is coming back!"Qian Wuliang was overjoyed.“……”The other party was stunned.What the hell?

He was stunned for a moment!In his eyes, this man, or rather, these two, was the Silver Moon King. Or at least, that beast of primordial chaos was the Silver Moon King. The other was the master of the world, while these two were the Masters of the great Dao.Out of the three, it wouldn't be surprising to see who was the Silver Moon King.But ... The Lord of the great Dao was here, the Lord of the World was here, how could there be any Silvermoon King?I'll believe you if you say you're a neo martial human King.Silver Moon King ... Are you talking nonsense?"Silver Moon King?""Are you joking?" Emperor smoked wind laughed. You're not the Silver Moon King?""Of course not!"Qian Wuliang roared and activated his Dao of desire."We are Silver moon's ministers. You have eyes but fail to see, our King is about to return!"“……”Is he crazy?Apotheosis Emperor fumigation wind sent him flying with a gust of astral wind and sneered. "Don't tell me you're talking about venerable sword?""Naturally not!""Hahaha!"Smoked wind laughed wildly."I thought he was a revered sword artist, but it turns out he's not. He must be a newbie."You're a Lord of the great path, but you're only a rank one. A rank two world Lord ... You're not a world Lord, not a Lord of the great path ... You're the Silver Moon King, but you're not a venerable sovereign, right?He really wanted to laugh!They couldn't help but laugh. In everyone's knowledge, the strongest in a world was either the master of the world or the master of the great Dao. If a small or medium-sized world didn't have a master of the great Dao, then the world Master was the strongest ... This was the iron law!And now, in this new world of Silver Moon, there was actually another King ...The master of the great Dao was only at the first level. Wouldn't that be a joke?However, at this moment, in the distance, Heaven's Fate also snorted coldly."You're dead!"On the other side, Lin Hongyu shouted coldly,""Don't even think of escaping when he returns!"Even though he knew that Li Hao had only been at the 1st rank when he left ... So what?He was always unexpected!Since he dared to rush back so quickly ... All of you will die.Outsiders would never understand that kind of inexplicable confidence.It was just like how the new martial artists trusted the human King ... But at the same time, they also trusted the Supreme martial artist, Emperor Cang, and sun god ... In the eyes of the Silvermoon people, there was only Li Hao.Li Hao was the only one who made them feel at ease. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The venerable sovereigns didn't bother to answer him, and smoke wind sneered,""It's good that you're back. We can catch them all in one fell swoop!"At that moment, Lin Hongyu's expression changed.Li Hao was rushing over at an unimaginable speed. At this moment, he was already very close and could arrive at any time.At the same time, smoke frowned slightly and suddenly turned back to look at the void behind him.There was no one there.However, at this moment, he felt a little uneasy.Looking again ... He was stunned. In the distance, there seemed to be a dark cloud that suddenly appeared out of thin air. How could there be dark clouds in the chaos?Strange! His expression changed, while the celestial pole cultivators were ecstatic!When they saw the familiar dark clouds, they knew that Li Hao had returned.Of course, it also brought with it the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. His appearance always seemed to be so different. When other people arrived, there was either no movement or pressure. Only he had arrived before the lightning tribulation!At this moment, a chuckle reverberated through the void.""Catch them all in one fell swoop?"The venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed slightly.At this moment, Li Hao's figure appeared, and so did Ming Hao and the others. All of a sudden, more than ten venerable sovereigns appeared.Apotheosis Emperor fumigation wind recognized Ming Hao and the others, and his expression changed slightly."Senior Minghao ..."As for Ming Hao and the others, their faces changed slightly after they scanned the area.What was going on?Why ... Why did it feel like smoke's opponent was the master of the great Dao, much more so than Li Hao 's, who had seriously fused thousands of DAOs into a Dao River?However ... He was too weak.A new universe!At this moment, they all thought of one word.If Li Hao was right, then Qian Wuliang's team was right.Ming Hao and the others 'expressions changed. The great Dao universe?Silver Moon!Half a master of the great Dao ...In an instant, they recalled Li Hao's previous words and many other things.At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything.His strength of the fifth step was still there. In an instant, a long river surrounded the world, and Li Hao's voice rang out. "You've caused me to lose many things ... I even wasted a rank five venerable sovereign's corpse ... You can't afford it!"In an instant, tens of thousands of stars appeared in the river.A long sword formed a star in the blink of an eye.The life and death Star had merged with the time star. In an instant, the first-stage venerable sovereigns, who were still in shock, felt their thoughts stop before they could escape!In the next moment, he could only watch as a sword pierced through his body and Dao mark. In an instant, a long river engulfed him and he was gone.The strength of the fifth step!With the aid of time, he would be able to completely crush anyone at the next level.The long sword reflected the void. In the next second, the stage two venerable sovereign in front of the celestial pole turned pale with fright. He looked at the long sword in front of him in horror, but the result was the same. In an instant, the long sword pierced through his body and cut off the Dao mark!The river of life and death swept over, and the other party disappeared again.The two venerable sovereigns were gone in the blink of an eye.The remaining two third level venerable sovereigns, smoke and wind, were both shocked and scared.How could this be!This was the Silver Moon King?Also, what's the situation with Ming Hao and the others? didn't they go to kill celestial pole and Huai King?Why would he be with the Silver Moon King?

At this moment, Minghao was also shocked and hurriedly said,""We'll take care of these two ..."He was suddenly a little frightened. This Haoyue had suddenly started a massacre at an unimaginable speed. At this moment, he, a rank four venerable sovereign, had yet to come back to his senses, and had yet to react from the river of the path.He hurriedly declared his position, but Li Hao looked into the distance and frowned."No need. You guys go to the South. A fourth level Crimson Moon venerable sovereign is coming. The ten of you, kill him!" Bring back the corpse! Otherwise ... You can think about it!"Minghao's expression changed slightly.Red Moon sovereign?The next moment, he gritted his teeth and said,"alright, I'll do my best!"In an instant, he flew South with many venerable sovereigns.Fourth stage venerable sovereign?I'm also a fourth-rank venerable sovereign. Although I'm not a venerable sovereign of a great world, there are still nine other venerable sovereigns.But ... What was going on?The Silver Moon had actually given birth to a new Dao universe!It was too unbelievable!The expressions of the two stage three venerable sovereigns changed drastically. Xun Feng hurriedly shouted,""Senior Minghao, there's a newly formed great path universe here. We're willing to help you seize the great path universe and regard you as the master of the great path. You'll definitely reach the seventh level ..."To be honest, there was a moment when Minghao's heart wavered.If they worked together, they would have two more 3rd rank experts.Plus, there are nine other venerable sovereigns here, and with me ... I might be able to fight.The universe of the great path!But the next moment, he suddenly felt cold sweat on his back.That was because Li Hao seemed to have been waiting for him to say this. When he was done, an even more powerful Time Force appeared in the blink of an eye, and a star emerged from the river!It was just like in the past when Time and Stars appeared and everything froze.Some of the weaker venerable sovereigns present even felt that they couldn't move. Although the two venerable sovereigns, Xun Feng, could barely move, their long swords pierced through their bodies in the blink of an eye!It was no different from the longevity sword!However, the difference was that there was some destructive power. As the sword slashed down, the dark clouds in the sky seemed to be drawn in. The destructive power erupted, and with a boom, the body of Thearch smoking wind exploded!He had beheaded him with a single sword strike!The great Dao emerged, and Li Hao suddenly slashed down with his sword. Xun Feng was not dead yet, but he had already appeared in front of another person. His palm cracked the other person's body, and he instantly tore him into pieces!The third level venerable sovereign was like paper as he tore it apart."Black Panther, eat it!" "Devour!" Li Hao bellowed. The Black Panther suddenly opened its huge mouth and sucked violently. A powerful devouring force erupted and devoured the venerable sovereign that Li Hao had torn apart. Even the power of his great Dao was devoured!A rumbling sound came from the Black Panther's body!Li Hao's long sword had already slashed down and shattered Qian Wuliang's Dao."Qian Wuliang, devour him!"Qian Wuliang didn't dare to say more. In an instant, a long river appeared and swallowed all the power of his great Dao. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Li Hao reached out and grabbed Lin Hongyu.""I'm going through the reincarnation of life and death to verify my Dao as a venerable sovereign. The Thunder tribulation just happened to be here. Let's go through the Tribulation together!"Without a word, Lin Hongyu stepped into Li Hao's River of Life and death and began to vindicate Dao!All of this happened so quickly that it was unimaginable.Minghao had just stopped for a moment ... But in the next second, in an instant, he flew South.His heart was filled with shock.F * ck!Even if he was a rank five, killing a few venerable sovereigns and two rank three venerable sovereigns would be as easy as killing chickens.This person ... Was truly terrifying.He was so frightened that he didn't have the mood to seize the great Dao universe ... He would save his life first!He could feel a pair of cold eyes staring at him from behind and quickly ran away. At this moment, he wanted to find Red Moon Emperor and kill him. Where did this person come from?Li Hao just watched in silence.Just now, he even had some thoughts ... To kill all these people and then kill Red Moon sovereign. This way, the rank five corpses that he had used up could be made up.However, this Minghao didn't have any thoughts about it ... Or rather, before he had the time to have any thoughts, he had already put an end to all of them.Li Hao didn't know whether it was right or wrong to kill them so quickly.Perhaps ... He should wait.This way, I'll be able to kill them in peace.Why did he have to find comfort for himself?This thought emerged in his mind. He looked at the crowd and then at the back. He frowned slightly. The venerable sovereign who was following them might be coming soon.The key was still the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. How troublesome!Did Shi Guang offend you?You'll do it every time you use it. Don't you find it troublesome?

Chapter 2734 Terrifying (1)
(He rushed back from Jiangxi in the morning. Today, he sped up his writing at two chapters a week. He was too tired in the afternoon and took a break. He took a six-or seven-hour car ride and didn't delay his writing. The Eagle is really awesome!)Killing four low-rank venerable sovereigns might seem unbelievable to ordinary people, but Li Hao didn't care.These were just the appetizers.The key was the chaos lightning tribulation. There was a sixth-rank venerable sovereign following them, and red Moon Emperor was approaching not far away ... It was not scary that Red Moon Emperor was a fourth-rank venerable. What was scary was that this place was within the range of the red moon.Even if it was only the edge, it was still within the range of the Crimson Moon.In this place, this fourth stage venerable sovereign might be even more troublesome.In the river of life and death, Lin Hongyu was walking the Dao of life and death. Li Hao did not pay attention to her. The Black Panther had devoured a rank three, and the two Dao Masters had devoured another rank three.A third rank venerable sovereign was not enough to make up for the loss of a fifth rank venerable sovereign.Moreover, he was not interested in activating the Dao chess at the moment. At the moment, he did not have much insight into Dao and did not have any research on the ultimate Yin Dao. Going to the Dao chess at this moment ... Was a waste of time and opportunity.He had to go through the Tribulation immediately. It would be best if he could kill Red Moon sovereign and escape from the tracking of the sixth rank venerable sovereigns!How troublesome!At this moment, everyone else was absorbing and digesting the energy, except for celestial pole. Although he was injured quite badly, he didn't care too much. He hurriedly stepped forward and sighed. "You're finally here ... By the way, what's going on with you?"His gaze was complicated.We were hoping that you would come back and kill everyone, and you really did ... Damn, you're so strong.I am so weak!My true body doesn't seem to be able to beat you.His main body was at level three. Even a great world's venerable sovereign could only kill level three itinerant cultivators. Two level three itinerant cultivators ... Were probably no match for him.But Li Hao?Like cutting melons, they were all killed in a few moves!It was unbelievable.In addition, Li Hao's current aura gave him the feeling that compared to a hundred thousand years ago ... Or even fifty years ago, there were not many people in neo martial arts who could surpass Li Hao.It was unbelievable!How could that be possible?Li Hao had no interest in paying him any attention. The celestial pole's main body was nothing now."How far is your main body?""How did you know?"“……”Nonsense, everyone is after you. "The venerable sovereigns I brought here, including myself, are all here to kill your true body!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Celestial pole was a little stiff.I'll go!You think highly of me.There were many venerable sovereigns just now, and it seemed that there were even intermediate venerable sovereigns.Are you all here to kill me?"There seems to be a sixth level venerable sovereign behind you. He's not far from me. He's also here for you."Tian Ji was dumbfounded. After a while, he realized something. After all, he wasn't his main body and didn't know much about the situation. At this moment, he understood. "There's a high probability that it's not for me, but for the others in neo martial arts! However, there's a high chance that you've really brought all these for me!""And King Huai," Li Hao nodded."Him?""What?" Tian Ji was stunned. The next moment, he laughed."I came here with that old bastard?"He was older than King Huai, but when he mentioned King Huai, he could not help but laugh."That old bastard is here as well. How interesting. This must have been arranged by the Paragon, right? You really dare to think!"He found it unbelievable.The next moment, he realized something."If I'm not mistaken, there must be someone following my original body. It's either a Supreme martial artist's avatar or another strong neo martial artist. There's at least a sixth-tier!""King Huai and I are moving out together ... We don't trust anyone, so there must be a purpose and arrangements!"He also knew that the situation was urgent, so he said without Li Hao asking,""I'm not too far away from you, but ... According to the speed of a first level venerable sovereign, it will take at least a month for us to meet ... Of course, with your current speed, I think it will take at most ten days!"He then added,"that's for us. If my main body were to meet up with us, I feel that my main body's speed isn't slow. It might be riding on some treasure and traveling in both directions. The time might be shortened to six or seven days ... Provided that my main body doesn't run!"Six or seven days was nothing in the chaos. It passed by in the blink of an eye.With the celestial pole's avatar present, the location was more accurate. The information that Ming Hao and the others had obtained, including the location, was only a rough estimate. It was not a specific location, as the celestial pole himself was moving.Six or seven days was not a long time.However, in the current situation, it would be useless to gather his true body. Unless, according to what the celestial pole had said, a Paragon's clone was present, or there was a sixth-rank cultivator following them, there was no hope of stopping the fellow chasing after them.That fellow must have sensed something, perhaps even seen the dark clouds of the primal Chaos tribulation lightning, and was hurrying over.Li Hao was the only one who was faster and left his opponent in the dust.Hearing Heaven's Fate's words, Li Hao didn't say much. He quickly said,""Let's go. We'll exterminate that fellow from the red moon clan first. You guys should cultivate and advance. Senior Empyrean terminus, can your true body hurry up and meet up with us?""Accelerate?" "I am very cautious ... King Huai is as timid as a mouse. Under normal circumstances, he would not do this," the celestial pole clone said hesitantly.He thought for a moment and said,"but it's not that there's no way ... Whether it's the main body or King Huai, they actually hope to obtain some benefits. How about this? if you have any extra energy, let me absorb some of the power of the great Dao and see if my clone can enter the second rank ... The main body can sense it when it advances. If he sees the benefits, he might run faster."

Chapter 2735 Terrifying (2)
“……”Li Hao looked at him. Are you trying to trick me?Heaven's Fate felt somewhat innocent.He was serious!Otherwise, it would be too difficult to count on the main body and King Huai to speed up.These two guys ... Alright, one of them was himself. He was like this. If he didn't give enough benefits, why would he rush over?'I've entered the second stage and advanced so quickly. I'm sure that I'll feel that there are countless benefits here. King Huai is usually timid, but once he knows that there are benefits, he'll definitely run faster than a rabbit. A journey that takes six or seven days can be shortened to five days even if he risks his life. 'It would probably be difficult to go any faster.He knew himself too well, and he also knew King Huai too well.Li Hao calculated for a moment. It was still a little far ... But it was better than being a few months away.Five or six days?Probably more.I can't maintain the speed of the fifth step for long. The power of the fifth step didn't come out of nowhere this time, but because of the power contained in the corpse. It can be preserved for a longer time, but once mi Han's original energy is exhausted, it will be gone.He was stuffed to death after a few hours.It lasted for five to six days ... And there was no chance.Turn around and fight with the other party?Forget it.After all, he was not a true rank five, so he would definitely not win. The commotion here was too big, and if the Crimson Moon experts attacked again, he would die without a doubt.Escaping was the key while he still had energy left.With this thought in mind, he reached out his hand and swept everyone into the river. Li Hao didn't care what they were thinking and quickly said,""A rank six venerable sovereign is about to arrive. Retreat immediately!"Everyone was silent.Li Hao's return put everyone at ease. They would do whatever Li Hao said.Lin Hongyu was still in the process of leveling up, and the rest were also absorbing energy.Li Hao only informed them. The next moment, he grabbed Heaven's Fate and flew into the distance. Over there, a battle had broken out. Ming Hao and the others didn't flee, perhaps because they felt that they were too close to escape.…… Not far away.Red Moon sovereign's face was gloomy.The great Dao appeared, and the strong power of the Crimson Moon swept in all directions. A few weaker venerable sovereigns blushed and were a little shaken.The red moon's venerable sovereign was also furious,""Minghao?"Such courage!He knew Minghao.He even knew that the other party had accepted the mission to kill Heaven's Fate and the others. The key was that this guy didn't go to kill Heaven's Fate, but instead came to deal with him. Was he crazy?Although we're both at the fourth rank, Who am I? I'm a venerable sovereign of a great world!Ming Hao was a rogue cultivator born in a middle-tier world. Even their world overlords wouldn't dare to be so arrogant when they met him. Of course, people like Ming Hao, after leaving their world and becoming rogue cultivators, their relationship with their world would be completely cut off.Some sector Lords even announced that they would cut off all ties with the wandering cultivators.There was no other reason. Wandering cultivators easily attracted trouble when they traveled outside.Therefore, most of these people were individual cultivators without any Foundation. Even if they killed the other party, the medium-level world Lords would not say a word.Minghao's scalp was also numb!A level four venerable sovereign from a great world ... Of course, they were a little stronger. However, at this moment, there were a total of ten venerable sovereigns. They were not afraid of the other party. The key point was that they were within the range of the Crimson Moon.Really ... He wanted to die.However, compared to the person behind him, he was much less afraid of the person in front of him. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 That person can really kill you at any time!At this moment, he could not react in time. The situation on Li Hao's side was too complicated. The only thing he knew was that Li Hao could not escape. Therefore, he could only stop or even kill the red moon sovereign.Would he die now, or would he be hunted down by the Crimson Moon? was there a need to consider?Ming Hao was also at the fourth stage. At this moment, he also displayed the power of the fourth stage. The moment he attacked, he could turn the world upside down. He cultivated the power of the fist way. These individual cultivators were relatively weaker in the elemental way and the weapon way. Most of them would choose the more direct and more rough physical way.As soon as he punched, the space trembled and the chaotic aura exploded.With the other nine venerable sovereigns joining forces, they suppressed venerable Red Moon for a while. Although the other party was strong, he was at the same level as Ming Hao.Minghao was also extremely worried, and could only shout,"Auxiliary Gu, it's not that I'm targeting you. I'm just following someone's orders and I have no choice ..."He had to leave a backup plan.'If I can't kill this guy, he'll run away or attract other Red Moon sovereigns ... I hope they won't target me first. I'm just an employee. Don't look for me.'The expression of the expert who was called the assistant Gu changed slightly.To obey orders!Whose order?Neo martial?Other than neo martial, who else would want to kill a Crimson Moon powerhouse?However, he had never heard of neo martial recruiting powerhouses from the outside.It was a little strange!It was obvious that he was no match for the ten of them, even if the other venerable sovereigns were all at the initial stage. A wise man knew not to fight when the odds were against him. He quickly sent a message,""If that's the case, open up a passage and let me leave. Minghao, there's no need to be so ruthless when you're serving someone else! Otherwise, if I really die Here, will you be able to bear the responsibility? I'll also give you a promise. If you step aside, I won't take revenge on you after I leave!"Ming Hao was a little hesitant.Leave a line in life, it'll be easier to meet in the future.This was the rule of conduct for itinerant chaos cultivators.This kind of person with a strong background and was in the other party's territory was too easy to get into trouble. At least, neo martial didn't have a fixed residence, but this was red moon's territory.Minghao thought to himself and sent a message,"Fellow Daoist Fuya, I really didn't want to target you this time. I was forced by the situation. As for giving up the passage ... I'm also in a difficult position. The person who instructed me is just behind ..."

Chapter 2736 Scary (3)
"Then why are you still dawdling? I'll leave as soon as possible. Otherwise ... If you kill me while we're still in the great world's range, can you hide it from my master once he finds out?"Another level 8!You're threatening me again!It was difficult to be a rogue cultivator.Ming Hao was helpless, but he did not want to offend either side. Although he had already offended them, and he knew that the assistant would probably punish him, as long as he did not kill the assistant, he would surrender to Hong Yue, a medium venerable sovereign.Middle-stage venerable sovereigns were still worth roping in. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 In the next moment, he made a decision in his heart. Since he couldn't win ... Since both sides were here, he might as well just be a bystander."Okay ... Fellow Daoist Fu min, it's not good for me to let you go. The referee is only at the first stage. You can break out from there later ..."As he was speaking, his expression suddenly changed.A dark cloud covered the area.An incomparably powerful sword light instantly slashed over, bringing with it the momentum of Rolling Thunder. Its voice was like a great Bell that resounded through the chaos."Ming Hao Emperor team, kill Red Moon Emperor here and spread the power of my wandering chaos!"Minghao's expression changed slightly.The next moment, the voice rang out again."Watch my sword. Chi, move aside. Senior Minghao has already set a trap. We'll kill this person!"Ming Hao's expression changed drastically!He knew!Red Moon sovereign's expression changed drastically. In an instant, without saying a word, he rushed toward Ming Hao. At this moment, he felt the pressure. The power of the fifth rank!He also suspected that this was a trap set by Minghao.Of course, he was too nervous at the moment. If he had the time to think about it carefully, he would probably understand that Ming Hao did not need to do this.But at this time, the sword intent came. He didn't have time to think carefully.At this moment, Minghao's expression changed.What to do?Yield?Retreat?He pretended to be no match and was forced back by the auxiliary Gu while the other party broke out of the encirclement.However...This Haoyue, with just a single sentence, telling him to retreat, and setting up a trap to kill the auxiliary Gu, Ming Hao knew that Haoyue had seen through it. It wasn't that he was spying on him, but rather, he had predicted that he would do so.Damn it!This guy, he really ... Really saw through the wandering cultivator's mind.Ming Hao's eyes flashed.As an itinerant cultivator who had been in the chaos for many years, he knew that he only had two choices. The first was to kill the auxiliary Voodoo! The second option was to team up with the auxiliary Gu and fight Li Hao.Choose one!There was definitely no middle part.At this stage, only by leaning towards one side would there be no fence-sitters. Otherwise, there might be a huge problem. This was the experience of the Rogue cultivators and also the wisdom of the primal Chaos thearchs.Should he choose Crimson moon's assistant Gu or the unfathomable Haoyue?One was even stronger now, at Tier 5.The territory was right here. The Crimson Moon covered an area, even if it was only at the edge. If he killed the other party, the universe would definitely be in turmoil. The other venerable sovereigns would still be fine as they would need time to arrive. The only thing he had to worry about was the Crimson Moon's master. The master of the Crimson Moon would travel through the universe to arrive in person, which would be much faster! The other party had the capital.He only hesitated for a moment, but he still made a choice.With two rank 4s, he was confident that he could resist a rank 5s!That's right, Ming Hao chose to fight Li Hao at this moment, not the auxiliary Gu, because this was the territory of a level eight Supreme Emperor, and Li Hao only brought the mark of an eighth level Emperor weapon.He was very afraid!However, compared to the unknown eighth rank venerable sovereign, Red Moon master was nearby. Perhaps, by doing the auxiliary Gu a favor, he could get the other party to help him remove the mark.In the next moment, Minghao turned around. He did not receive the attack of the auxiliary Gu, but instead quickly transmitted his voice,""Let's kill him together. His rank five power is only temporarily borrowed. He still has the primal Chaos lightning tribulation on him. Also, there should be a rank six venerable sovereign behind him ... He should be Red moon's ally!"He wasn't stupid, and he guessed that there was at least a sixth-rank behind him.Under such circumstances, they naturally chose to join forces with the auxiliary Gu to fight Li Hao!As long as they could delay for a while, even if they could not kill Li Hao, when that Tier 6 or Crimson Moon expert arrived, victory would naturally lean towards Crimson Moon, not bright moon. Even if the other party had the divine light realm and neo martial realm behind them, they were not here at the moment.More importantly, if ... Both sides were to suffer heavy losses, with Haoyue and this assistant of his dead and injured, at that time, he ... Would still have some greed in his heart. The great Dao universe!He saw it!He was sure that the Silver Moon had given birth to a great path universe, but at this moment, the auxiliary puppet didn't know. As long as Haoyue died, and the others died, even if the auxiliary puppet didn't die, he wouldn't know the situation. Perhaps ... He could seize the great path universe.The thoughts of a venerable sovereign and a middle-stage venerable sovereign changed instantly.Greed and desire, perhaps due to the influence of the Crimson Moon, or perhaps this was the nature of the chaos Emperor, at this moment, Ming Hao chose to fight against Li Hao. No matter how one looked at it ... Even if the two stage four experts could not kill the stage five, it would not be difficult for them to stall for time.As Ming Hao suddenly changed sides, he charged at Li Hao with the auxiliary Gu to resist the other's sword intent.The other nine venerable sovereigns were all stunned.He was not too surprised, but he was a little ... Hesitant.What should we do?They were only low-level venerable sovereigns, and Li Hao's killing power was too terrifying. However, two level four venerable sovereigns working together to deal with a level five venerable sovereigns, and they were in Red moon's territory ... All of a sudden, everyone was at a loss."Kill him!" Ming Hao shouted when he saw the situation. There's still a rank six venerable sovereign coming from behind, and the Crimson Moon expert is just a stone's throw away. If we kill him, the Crimson Moon will definitely reward us!"

Chapter 2737 Terrifying (3)
The auxiliary Gu was also overjoyed!"That's right. If we work together to kill him, I, Red moon, will not be stingy with my rewards!"But at this moment, Li Hao's expression was calm.As expected, stories were all lies.There was no love at first sight, no domineering aura, no overbearing aura.Minghao still rebelled!Of course, he was forced to do so. It was just that he did not expect, or rather, he subconsciously thought that even if Ming Hao wanted to rebel, it would not be so fast ... In the end, the other party really did it so quickly!It was useless to kill as a deterrent.After the other party judged the pros and cons, they instantly made the decision to oppose Li Hao!Wandering cultivators were still unreliable.Although he didn't think that it was reliable, at this moment, it was proven that a forcibly twisted melon was not sweet.The two level four venerable sovereigns joined forces and instantly destroyed Li Hao's sword intent.At this point, the lightning tribulation was brewing and was extremely powerful. It was about to descend and there were signs of a level five lightning. Not only that, as Lin Hongyu vindicated her Dao, the lightning tribulation was still stacking up.Behind him, he could even vaguely sense the aura of a rank six venerable sovereign. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 All of a sudden, Li Hao's situation changed from crushing his opponent earlier to a huge gap after Ming Hao's betrayal."Smart!"Li Hao sighed with emotion. He took a step back and looked at Ming Hao.Was this a wise choice?Wise!After all, Li Hao was hired by Red Moon, and he was in Red moon's territory. Judging the situation ... It was not normal for Li Hao to not rebel. He was a gambler who bet that Li Hao still had a trump card. Minghao was actually a little afraid, an inexplicable fear.But at this time, he couldn't care anymore!He gritted his teeth and shouted in a low voice,"you forced us to do this. We are only rogue cultivators. We took their money and helped them get rid of their disasters!" We've already taken Crimson moon's money and come to deal with new martial arts. You force us to work for you, but there's no benefit at all. You treat us like slaves ... Who Do You Think You Are? Haoyue, your strength of the fifth step is only an illusion, and can't be maintained for long. If you retreat now, you might have a chance of survival ..."In fact, he didn't want to fight Li Hao to the end.In fact, he was still a little scared."Retreat?"Before Li Hao could say anything, Red moon's assistant Gu snorted.""Let's work together to hold him back. Even if we can't kill him, give me some time. You dare to act so atrociously in the range of the Crimson Moon, you're courting death!"At this moment, he was full of confidence and trembled.Just now, he only wanted to escape, but when the auxiliary Gu turned against him, he was relieved.A Tier 5 would not be able to deal with them.Behind him, some of the nine venerable sovereigns hesitated, while others instantly regained their senses and shouted,""Haoyue, you're dead! You threatened us and ordered us around like slaves. You deserve to die!"At this time, these guys turned against him faster than they could turn hostile.This was chaos!It was true that they were fence-sitters, and it was a fact that Li Hao had forced them to do so. Out of the remaining nine venerable sovereigns, six of them instantly moved closer to them.On the other hand, the judge, Chan Xiu, and the other third grade venerable sovereign were slightly hesitant.They were also afraid of Li Hao.The referee had talked to Li Hao for a long time before. He felt that Supreme Emperor Hao Yue had a great background and it was not good to offend him now. If Hao Yue did not die ... Wouldn't he be in big trouble?At this moment, Li Hao turned around.This time, he really sensed the aura of a venerable sovereign, who was quickly approaching him.It was too late to delay any longer.Out of the 11 venerable sovereigns, eight of them charged at him. Three of them hesitated slightly, but they could not change the overall situation. They were not considered strong. The strongest one was only a level three venerable sovereign.Furthermore, the Sharkmen might not even dare to help him.Li Hao didn't count on it at all!It was too childish to expect a group of people who had been forced to surrender to work for him, especially at this time!At this moment, Li Hao's face was cold.He didn't say anything. The river of life and death appeared, and in an instant, a time star appeared. The next moment, two rivers of the great Dao appeared near the river of life and death. Everyone was stunned!The great Dao universe!This time, it was too obvious.With Time and Stars as the core, the three were originally one.In fact, the time star was the core of the great Dao universe. It had only been seized by Li Hao.In an instant, the Three Rivers merged into one.Li Hao's aura grew again. Not only that, but at this time, Li Hao reached out and grabbed. The huge Beast of Chaos suddenly turned into a ball and gradually shrank. In the blink of an eye, it was as small as a red dot and fell into Li Hao's forehead.The world!The Silvermoon world!At this moment, the power of the world overflowed from Li Hao's body. He was the master of the world and the master of the great Dao!At this moment, he chose to fuse the Silver Moon world and the dual-Dao universe again.He became the master of Silvermoon's world and the master of the great Dao of the dual-Dao universe."All people, bless me!"His voice was like a great Bell that shook the heavens and the earth. The people of the Silver Moon world were instantly excited.Marchioness Silvermoon!He's back!They had been cheering for Li Hao before, but because they hadn't been cheering for Li Hao, they hadn't been as excited. At this moment, hearing Li Hao's familiar voice, even Yuan Shuo and the others, who were setting up the formation, were invigorated.The next moment, they all shouted,"we are willing to die for the Silver Moon Marquis!"BOOM!The power of 10000 DAOs instantly skyrocketed and became even more powerful than before. The heavenly leopard also instantly swept up all the natural energy and fused it into Li Hao without holding back.The masters of the world and the great Dao often had some conflicts.

Chapter 2738 Scary (Part 5)
However, in Silver Moon, Black Panther would not do so.Without any reservations, all the power of heaven's will and the power of the world emerged without any reservation. The two masters of the great Dao did the same.At that moment, the bodies of the venerable sovereigns were burning in the river.The bodies of the venerable sovereigns he had just killed and the second stage venerable sovereign he had killed earlier, as well as the power of their great DAOs, were all set ablaze in the river formed by the convergence of the Three Rivers.On the other side, the expressions of Minghao and the others changed drastically!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be even more powerful than before.The power of a great Dao and the power of the world emerged.A true Dao master!Ming Hao's expression changed as he shouted,"Kill!"At this point, it was useless to turn back. It was fine if he betrayed them once or twice, but if he betrayed them again, no one would trust him.The auxiliary Gu's expression also changed. A universe seemed to have appeared above his head, and a strong power of desire rose. The other party instantly joined hands with the others, shuttling through the void and attacking Li Hao!He just needed to block it for a while!The two fourth level venerable sovereigns could sense that there was an aura coming from afar. They should be able to arrive soon."Minghao, this is your choice, and your destiny!" Li Hao said coldly.Fate?What a joke!The next moment, Time and Stars appeared, and the whole world seemed to freeze for a moment. The two fourth rank venerable sovereigns were not affected much, but the other venerable sovereigns were greatly affected.At this moment, Li Hao had almost reached his strongest state. He wasn't any weaker than when he had borrowed the power of the water element.How could a low level venerable sovereign stop him?The power of time was too intimidating for these low-level venerable sovereigns.Heaven and earth seemed to be frozen!Although Ming Hao had seen it before, he was still shocked. He shouted,"What kind of power is this?"He swung his fist at Li Hao!What kind of power was this? it was so terrifying that it could imprison the other six venerable sovereigns in an instant. He and his auxiliary puppets seemed to be slower than usual."This is ... The power of time!" He exclaimed.Li Hao looked up at the sky. At this moment, tribulation lightning appeared in the sky.In an instant, the lightning tribulation seemed to have expanded by a large amount.This was because Li Hao had used the power of time in a large area.The long river swept in all directions. At that time, it was not just the long river that appeared. There were also many divine runes that suddenly turned into a huge domain, covering the long river with a thin film.It enveloped Li Hao and everyone else.The domain appeared!Li Hao had some new insights about the domain that he had long abandoned in the dark Demon Ridge. After entering the Dao chess game, he had some new insights. At this time, they emerged, not to kill, but to ... Transcend the Tribulation together!Li Hao had used this move before. Back then, it was heaven's will.Today, I've transformed my domain into a domain that covers everyone. My domain is my world! I'm in my own world, I'm the ruler!These two fourth stage venerable sovereigns can't break my domain, so they'll accompany me to cross the Tribulation!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world!Tribulation lightning instantly erupted. Because Li Hao kept using the power of time, the Tribulation lightning was instantly enraged. This time, the power of the Tribulation lightning even vaguely reached the sixth step.In the distance, a venerable sovereign stopped in shock!Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was getting stronger and stronger. At this moment, even though it was rumored that the primal Chaos lightning tribulation wouldn't affect anyone else, the rank six venerable sovereign stopped in his tracks. His face turned pale with fear. This thing was too frightening.BOOM!Among the crowd, a first stage venerable sovereign, one of the only two first stage venerable sovereigns besides Yi, was instantly hacked into pieces.Out of the 11 venerable sovereigns, three of them were not enveloped.Eight of them were enveloped within.There were two rank four, three rank three, one rank two, and two rank one venerable sovereigns.All of a sudden, a sixth-grade lightning power had killed one of them.He couldn't move!Unable to resist, unable to resist, the power of time covered them. All of them experienced the chaos lightning tribulation together. With the exception of the three intermediate venerable sovereigns, the other venerable sovereigns either vomited blood, fell from the sky with heavy injuries, or were directly struck to death!With just one strike, a first stage venerable sovereign was struck to death!"How could it be!""This is ... A domain?""Dao domain?" the assistant Gu was shocked."Dao domain ... Is this a domain that only Dao Masters have?"They had been enveloped in the domain!"Break the domain!"The auxiliary Gu shouted. He had also been injured by the attack just now. Although it was not too serious, it was only one attack.He had to escape from this domain!Ming Hao also immediately came back to his senses, and the two of them madly attacked the domain that enveloped them!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated in the sky. Their attacks and lightning descended at the same time. Li Hao's domain began to shatter, and the second lightning strike instantly struck the other level one venerable sovereign to death!The remaining venerable sovereigns were all seriously injured. Some of their bodies were even crumbling.Minghao and the others were all injured, and Li Hao had also suffered some light injuries.Li Hao's expression was cold. He saw that his domain was about to collapse. Perhaps, with another attack, these two would break his domain!But ... Was there still a chance? Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 At this moment, the third Thunderbolt descended, but Li Hao did not care. He slashed his sword at the two fourth stage venerable sovereigns. The two fourth stage venerable sovereigns were now faced with a difficult problem. Should they resist the third Thunderbolt, the sword intent, or continue to break the territory ...Very quickly, the two of them made different decisions.

Chapter 2739 Scary (3)_6
Minghao turned around and threw a punch at Li Hao's sword intent.The auxiliary Gu struck at the domain. As for the lightning tribulation, the two of them ignored it. Although the lightning tribulation was strong, it was only the third strike. It wasn't enough to kill them.Breaking the domain and blocking Li Hao's attack ... That was all he needed.BOOM!The lightning tribulation exploded on everyone at the same time.Li Hao's body trembled, and two stage four venerable sovereigns coughed up blood. Of the remaining four venerable sovereigns, one stage two venerable sovereigns was directly hacked into pieces, and one of the three stage three venerable sovereigns was also instantly hacked into pieces.The remaining two had their bodies shattered, and the marks of their great Dao were ready to escape.BOOM!The domain also exploded, and the remaining four venerable sovereigns were overjoyed!With the domain gone, the lightning tribulation above their heads suddenly disappeared and no longer enveloped them. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 At this moment, Li Hao smiled.He grinned, revealing his snow-white teeth."How about one more time?"What did that mean?In the next moment, time seemed to reverse. The lightning tribulation in the sky suddenly intensified, and the domain appeared. The four venerable sovereigns seemed to take a step back at the same time and returned to the domain.At this moment, the power of the God tribulation lightning increased by a large margin.If it was originally an attack at the early stage of the sixth rank, this time, it was at least at the middle or even late stage ...Everyone, except Li Hao, was stunned!"Time ..."Mumbled Ming Hao. His auxiliary Voodoo was also filled with despair. How could this be?They risked their lives to break the domain, but the domain reappeared.BOOM!The fourth lightning tribulation appeared. This time, with a loud bang, the two third stage venerable sovereigns were directly blown to pieces. The destructive lightning tribulation killed them in an instant!The remaining two middle-stage venerable sovereigns also coughed up blood and their bodies were cracked.This time, the two of them were extremely desperate.How could this be!Li Hao revealed a smile. This was time.It's hard to deal with strong people, but is it ... Hard to deal with the two of you?So what if the lightning tribulation was a little stronger?With the two of you helping me resist it ... Actually, the outcome would be pretty much the same as me resisting a weaker lightning tribulation by myself.BOOM!The fifth lightning tribulation descended with a loud boom. The three of them coughed up blood at the same time. Li Hao's fifth step power was somewhat dissipated by the lightning, and the two fourth step venerable sovereigns were even worse off!Ming Hao, a wandering cultivator, was torn apart by Chi's body. He wailed in pain and was unwilling to accept this."This power shouldn't appear in chaos ...""That's right. That's why there's the chaos lightning tribulation, isn't it?""Haha!" Li Hao laughed heartily."Do you understand why the chaos lightning tribulation appeared this time?"He was speechless!That's right!In the next moment, the sixth lightning tribulation followed. With a loud rumble, the entire heaven and earth was covered. Even the chaos was shattered by the lightning. The two fourth stage venerable sovereigns 'bodies were completely shattered.Just as the two of them were in despair, a beam of sword light shot over.A sword pierced through Ming Hao's great Dao!Li Hao appeared in front of him. The river swept past him, but he still retained some energy. He couldn't stop vomiting blood and laughed. "Don't waste it!""Lord Hao Yue ... Please spare me ..."BOOM!The Dao marks shattered!Li Hao sighed."I actually spared you before. Otherwise, I would have killed you. I found an excuse for myself. I didn't kill you. You just didn't cherish it!"Am I a kind person?Actually, I've long had the intention to kill!However, I need a hypocritical and righteous excuse to convince myself not to kill you!But you, you gave up.I, Li Hao, have never been kind? Never!Kindness is only directed at those familiar people, friends, and family ... But you are not.BOOM!A middle-stage venerable sovereign had fallen.The sixth Thunderbolt struck down again. With a loud bang, the Dao marks of the auxiliary venerated sovereign from the great world were also revealed. At this moment, a great path universe appeared in the sky.Crimson Moon universe!At this moment, a vast and boundless pressure seeped through the air, even surpassing the primal Chaos tribulation lightning.But the primal Chaos tribulation lightning seemed to be unafraid.There was no change at all!A blurry consciousness seemed to descend upon this world and peer into it. The first thing it saw was the primal Chaos lightning tribulation."Another Primal Chaos lightning tribulation ..."A somewhat illusory voice sounded.One chaos lightning tribulation after another appeared.The deaths of the venerable sovereigns seemed to have something to do with the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. This time, even a rank four venerable sovereign was involved. The strength of the lightning tribulation and the vague consciousness could be sensed.Tier 6!What was going on?If Shi Gu had been killed before, he could still accept the first stage of Primal Chaos lightning tribulation.However, in the blink of an eye, a sixth-grade lightning tribulation had appeared within the red moon. This was unacceptable.If this continued, wouldn't a level Seven or level eight lightning tribulation appear?However, that powerful consciousness didn't attack or descend. If it did, it might be seen as a provocation from the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Perhaps it would really attract the eighth-grade lightning tribulation.They didn't need to be afraid usually, and at worst, they would just undergo tribulation. But at this point, who was to be trifled with?However ... He could not do it now!Neo martial was eyeing covetously, and there were several other regions around, so he couldn't take the risk.Red Moon master's consciousness started to fade away, but her voice reverberated in the area."Tribulation Transcender ... I'll remember you! You must be related to Silver Moon, to new martial, and perhaps the king of Silver Moon ... You will be listed as someone Red Moon must kill!"The red moon Lord had not seen Li Hao, nor did he need him.With his intelligence, he quickly realized that it was most likely related to the Silver Moon.As for whether he would die Here, that was not important. What was important was that if he did not die, Hong Yue would definitely hunt him down!Li Hao didn't say anything. He slashed out and completely shattered the Dao marks on the auxiliary Gu.The universe of the great path shook for a moment and disappeared very quickly. Red Moon Master's Voice started to spread.At this moment, the sixth rank venerable sovereign in the distance was shocked.A level eight venerable sovereign's consciousness had descended ... Or perhaps half-descended!The new king of the Silver Moon, how is that possible?That was the sixth rank lightning tribulation!It was impossible!BOOM!Another lightning tribulation descended. Li Hao withstood it and charged at the level six venerable sovereign the next moment. The venerable sovereign turned around and fled.He didn't know the exact situation, but he knew that this chaos lightning tribulation was different from the legends. It would strike anyone!I don't want to be struck to death!This sixth level venerable sovereign couldn't care about anything else and ran as fast as he could. He couldn't let the lightning tribulation catch up to him.In the Tribulation lightning, Li Hao was covered in blood, smiling.I knew it!Who wasn't afraid of death?Even though it was rumored that the chaos lightning tribulation would not strike those who were not related, how could this person not be afraid after seeing so many venerable sovereigns being struck to death?With a bright smile, Li Hao turned his head to look at the three venerable sovereigns who were trying to sneak away. He said in a flat voice,""The three of you, stay here. If I don't die, come with me. If I die ... You can escape!"The three of them were motionless, their bodies extremely stiff.At this moment, there was only fear.Even a rank eight Red Moon master sent a voice transmission over. It was too terrifying!They had never seen such a scene in their entire lives.
