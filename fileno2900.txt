Hearing him say this, King Huai's heart moved slightly. He quickly said,"Alright, I have no objections!" That works too!They would just take it as a chance to gain more experience. If it really didn't work, they could just give up energy. As Li Hao said, if a seventh-rank gave up energy, then the seventh-rank would require too much energy and would be difficult to recover. However, they were only at the lower ranks.He could recover it with tens of millions of Dao crystals.It seemed like ... Nothing!Chan Xiu and Yan were both slightly apprehensive, but at least they had King Huai by their side. The two of them hesitated for a moment before quickly transmitting their voices, "We're also willing!"From wandering to joining Silver Moon, and now to leaving Silver Moon to join forest orchid ... In truth, it would be a heaven-sent opportunity for him if he were to change the timing.He had joined the great world!How could these first and second stage itinerant cultivators have such an opportunity?However, with Li Hao ... They felt a little dazed and uneasy. They also felt that Silver Moon was actually not bad and had a lot of potential. Perhaps he would have more potential than Sen LAN if he joined Silver Moon.Even if Senlan could reach the seventh step as Li Hao had said, so what?Previously, Li Hao and the others had joined forces with venerable the sword and killed a level 7.Li Hao smiled."Don't worry ... I'll bring everyone back. If we can't return ... We won't lose anything." However, if you can return successfully, you will all become third level venerable sovereigns soon!"Whether or not he could directly leave Senlan with the energy would depend on what happened next.If he succeeded ... All the venerable sovereigns under him would become level three venerable sovereigns.This way, Silver moon's plan of borrowing a chicken to lay an egg would be completed.Of course, it would not be easy.At this moment, Li Hao didn't need to send anyone.……After a while, Ji Hao reappeared.This time, there was an expert beside him. Li Hao's eyes flickered ... So strong!Tier 6!This was the remaining rank six venerable sovereign of Senlan that Ji Hao had mentioned?Yan Fang?His heart skipped a beat and he hurriedly stood up with a smile on his face.""Greetings, senior!"Yan Fang looked at Li Hao and smiled."Daoist myriad DAOs, this is Senlan's Supreme Emperor Yan Fang, and also a senior of Senlan ..." Ji Hao hurriedly introduced. Yan Fang laughed,"I've long heard of your great name. Today, fellow Daoist killed two 4th rank experts with two sword strikes ... It can be said to be an eye-opener! I've come here for nothing other than to get to know you, fellow Daoist, and also to deliver the reward I promised earlier!"He waved his hand, and countless Dao crystals appeared. Li Hao hurriedly collected them.It wasn't a lot, just 60 million.The reward for two rank three venerable sovereigns.Then, a space vortex appeared in his hand. Gradually, a not-so-big sphere appeared in front of everyone like a star ... In fact, this was a real world!However, the world had been compressed.Ji Hao took a look and was slightly shocked. A middle-tier world!Li Hao's eyes also flickered. The other party was really efficient. Yan Fang smiled and said,"This is the reward promised by the realm Lord ... It has been reduced. If fellow cultivator wants to refine it, it's best to refine it in the outer realm! If I don't refine it and just devour it, then it would be simple. I wouldn't need to go to the outer realm!""Understood, many thanks senior, many thanks realm Lord ...""No, you deserve this!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Yan Fang laughed,"fellow Daoist and your group have made great contributions to the battle of the forest orchid guards. It's only natural!" Senlan is weak and can't give fellow Daoist more support ..."After saying that, he smiled and said,"but there's one thing that fellow Daoist can rest assured about!" If necessary, the Senlan people will also participate in the war!"After saying that, she said with a cold expression,'do those guys really think that I, Sen LAN, don't dare to kill? Fellow Daoist, don't worry. Since we're in the forest world and fighting for us, the people of forest will fight for us even if we're not as arrogant as the new martial artists and are not as fearless as them ..."Regardless of whether it was true or not, his attitude was still on point."Of course," Li Hao said hurriedly."Senlan's powerhouses can achieve a great world at the peak of the sixth stage. Who dares to say that Senlan is a coward?""Fellow Daoist, you're too kind!"Yan Fang laughed, and that world slowly floated towards Li Hao.Li Hao extended his hand, and the power of the great Dao of fire appeared and suppressed the void. A world slowly fell into Li Hao's hand. Li Hao quickly suppressed it and shifted the world, gradually merging it with his body.Seeing this, Yan Fang was slightly surprised.It was not easy to suppress a medium-level world. He was a tier six, but this person was only a tier four and had just entered. Yet, he could easily suppress a medium-level world ... He had just advanced. From the looks of it, even without his Dao domain and sovereign weapon, he was not a weakling."Then I won't disturb you any longer. Be careful these few days!"Yan Fang transmitted his voice over,"if the Crimson Moon tribe really comes, we will inform you in advance. We can also investigate the outside of the forest world!" In addition ... The realmlord also asked me to pass on a message. As long as the people of the Crimson Moon don't reveal their identity, they can't directly say that they are from the Crimson Moon! As long as a large number of experts don't see it ... When the opportunity arises, I will cooperate with fellow Daoist and kill the invading Crimson Moon experts!"Li Hao was moved again. He nodded to show that he understood.Yan Fang chuckled and left. A jade pendant appeared in Li Hao's hand."This is the communication jade talisman of my forest orchid realm. You can send me a message directly. If fellow Daoist needs anything ... You can find me at any time!""Many thanks, senior!"The other party had already left, and Ji Hao had also left in a hurry. At this moment, he suddenly sent a message to Li Hao,""Fellow Daoist might not know, but there are actually two factions in my forest world. One faction supports the realmlord and the other faction supports the Daoist Lord! "The Dao master's death is related to neo martial ... The outside world says that I, Senlan, and neo martial will fight to the death, but it's wrong. To the realm Lord, the Dao master's death is not enough! He almost brought Senlan to a point of eternal damnation. If it wasn't for the Dao master's reckless actions, why would I, Senlan, need to participate in the game of the red moon region? Although neo martial is crazy, they don't take the initiative to attack those neutral worlds ... Unless they state their stance and form an alliance with the Crimson Moon world!"

2901 Chapter 477
"Now that the Daoist master is dead, there are still many venerable sovereigns in the Daoist master's line ... They are spreading the threat of neo martial everywhere. In fact, what does the battle between neo martial and Crimson Moon have to do with us? The Dao Lord and the realm Lord have never been on good terms ... Now that he's dead, it's actually an opportunity for the realm Lord!"After saying this, the other party disappeared.Li Hao was stunned.A moment later, he finally understood what the other party meant.There was a slight change in his eyes. 'Is this ... Or is he guessing that I'm a neo martial artist?'He was saying that the enmity between new martial and Sen LAN ... Was also the enmity of the Dao master's bloodline. It had nothing to do with Sen LAN herself. The Sen LAN realm Lord actually didn't care. He even felt that it was good to die!If the Dao master didn't die, how would he have the chance to merge with the forest orchid?Was this Ji Hao...Or was this the world Overlord's idea?That person didn't mention this to Li Hao, nor did the Tier 6 Yan Fang. Instead, it was the Tier 4 Ji Hao who suddenly said this ... Was it a guess, or did he have something to use against him?This is getting interesting!Li Hao's eyes flickered. Was she telling him that even if he was really on neo martial's side, Senlan wouldn't find trouble with him?This was very interesting!There were also two factions in the forest orchid ...After thinking about it for a while, Li Hao decided not to think about it anymore. He explored the middle-level world, and his eyes flashed with joy. The next moment, he threw the Dao crystals to everyone. "I'll give you half of it. You're almost at the 2nd rank, I hope you can successfully advance this time! "The remaining half ... Give it to senior Empyrean pole's clone. The clone only lacks energy. If it's not enough to enter Tier 3, we'll think of another way!"As for the others, they had just advanced and needed to stabilize their cultivation.Li Hao didn't keep any of the sixty million great Dao crystals and gave them away ...At this moment, the others were also sighing.Li Hao was the absolute main force!However, Li Hao didn't actually take much from killing people twice and obtaining a large number of Dao crystals. As for the middle-level worlds, he had obtained them himself. These Dao crystals were enough to make many people break their heads!"Chan Xiu and senior Huai King ... Both of you are around peak stage two ... Entering the Dao universe is the opportunity to advance. I won't distribute it this time. For now, we should weigh the pros and cons and maximize the benefits ... I hope everyone can keep up!"The two of them naturally had no objections.It was already very good!Yan, on the other hand, was extremely excited. She had been at Level 1 for some years. In fact, she was still young and not too old. She had sensed Level 7 Taoist connotation once, although it was faked by Li Hao.However, he had indeed comprehended it once at the Coiling Dragon Well, experienced several great wars, and even joined the Dao universe ... It was actually not difficult to reach level two.At that moment, 30 million great Dao crystals were enough!Richard was confident that it could advance.For a moment, he was extremely excited.He might really have a chance to reach rank three soon. One must know that the limit of a rogue cultivator was rank three under normal circumstances.Rank four, either the opportunities were too great, or there was someone behind them. At this moment, the referee was moved to tears of gratitude ...Li Hao didn't pay much attention to her. However, Hong Yitang and the others glanced at the judge, who was the second female venerable sovereign in the Silver Moon faction.'You idolize her so much ... Be careful, Lin Hongyu won't make things difficult for you if she sees you.'Fortunately, that person had been in seclusion in the river and had not come out.…… At this time, Li Hao projected the river again."Senior second cat!"Li Hao shouted, somewhat excited.A moment later, second cat lazily emerged from the depths of the river. It glanced at Li Hao, feeling a little drowsy."Senior, the fish is here!"Li Hao was overjoyed. He was rarely this happy, but he had completed second cat's request not long after it was made, so he was still very happy."Fish?""That's right. Previously, senior said that you need 10 small fish. I don't have any small fish, but I have a medium-sized world. It's considered a medium-sized fish, right? one fish is equivalent to 10 fish, right?"Second cat had been sleeping the whole time and didn't really care. When he heard this, he was a little surprised.So fast?Didn't I just suggest it?At this moment, a world slowly floated out of the river and entered the river. It seemed to be rapidly expanding. It was a medium-level world, and the entire River seemed to be stagnant!Second cat looked at it and was a little surprised."You really brought it ...""Senior, if you want to eat fish, how can I not be satisfied?" Li Hao grinned.Second cat's eyes rolled and it glanced at Li Hao. Suddenly, it laughed too. Its whiskers trembled and a smile appeared on its chubby face. "That's pretty impressive. It looks like I can eat a great world next time!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  “……”Li Hao's smile froze. Stop it!Those who came from medium-level worlds were all accidents.Second cat laughed and quickly said,"a medium-sized world, not bad!" It's a good thing for you and me! I will consume the world origin within it, and you can split this medium-level world apart to perfect your small infinite worlds!""A medium-level world is only one step away from a high-level world ... Other than the fact that it doesn't have a great Dao universe and is equivalent to a filter for the power of the chaos great Dao, its Dao techniques are actually very complete. The world itself is a complete Dao domain!"Dao domain?Li Hao's heart stirred. He nodded. Yes, my little realm is made up of Dao domains."Your comprehension of Tao techniques is not enough," er Mao continued."If it was enough, you could have directly created a Dao universe in a medium-level world ... Li Hao, if one day you feel that you can directly create a Dao universe, you will be a high-leveled venerable sovereign!"

2902 Chapter 477
"That longevity sword is actually at such a stage. If he wants to enter the high level, to enter the seventh stage ... He needs a large amount of energy and a large amount of Dao law power. If there is enough, he can instantly enter the seventh stage! In fact, it's just like the process of a rank 6 world Lord's accumulation. In fact, it's inevitable for this person to enter rank 7, it just needs time. "Li Hao nodded again."How much power of great DAOs does he need?""Many, many things ... Devouring a world ... Such as this Senlan, maybe it's enough, maybe ... It's not enough!"Still not enough?Li Hao was startled. Sen LAN wasn't weak. Was this still not enough?Sen LAN, it was enough to support him into the 7th step."Maybe it's not enough, because this person is stronger than the average rank six. Do you understand?"Li Hao nodded. He suddenly felt that second cat knew a lot. He couldn't help but say,"Senior second cat, how long will it take for me to reach the fifth step?"Second cat looked at him and then looked at Changhe and said,""Right now, you've only condensed 360 little realms, but they're not strong. On the other hand, your fire elemental realm is already not weak. It's already in the embryonic form of a little world.....The other worlds, if they all reach this level, they should be able to enter level five, right?"“……”Li Hao was speechless.That would be a long wait.In order to make the fire World stronger, he had paid a large number of great Dao crystals and his comprehension of the fire element was far better than other great DAOs.That was how he was able to do this."Level five ... So difficult!"Second cat was speechless. Was it the fifth rank difficult? It wasn 't!You're the one who insisted on walking with such difficulty. If Li Hao really reached Level 5 ... He should be able to fight against Level 6 opponents. He can just suppress them with his strength!Li Hao's opportunities were great, and he was strong enough. He had actually obtained a lot of resources. An ordinary stage four would have to go to sleep if they wanted to obtain so much.If this guy was determined to advance and become a simple venerable sovereign, such as focusing on the fire element, he might be able to reach the fifth rank now, and even ... There was a high chance that he would be close to the sixth rank!It was inevitable that he would not bite off more than he could chew. Li Hao wanted more, but there was nothing he could do.Second cat didn't bother to say much and said,"Then absorb the power of those worlds. Enter the world yourself and study how to transplant flowers into trees. Move the Dao laws of this medium-level world into your little realm ... After eating this fish, I'll purify the river for you!"Li Hao was overjoyed!This person was really working hard.He wasn't too sure about the benefits of the long river's purification, but he could wait and see. After the impurities in the long river were purified, there would definitely be some changes.Li Hao didn't say much. He quickly entered the middle-level world.As soon as he entered, he felt the space expanding.It was extremely huge! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  This world was huge, but it was in a state of Quietus ... Quietus?Li Hao's heart stirred. It made sense. These worlds that were used for trade were not actually destroyed. They were simply destroyed. After refinement, they could be revived.It was killing two birds with one stone!As a rich second-generation heir, Kong Ji could actually purchase a large number of worlds and comprehend them one by one. He could comprehend the different states of Nirvana and then try to revive them. This way, Kong Ji would not need to take too much risk.Of course, if he didn't take the risk, perhaps it wouldn't be exciting enough for him?Li Hao laughed. It's good to be a rich second generation. It's a pity that he doesn't know how to cherish his life and insists on starting a business ... If it were me, I'd stay at home and live off my parents.He stopped thinking about it and completely integrated into the entire medium-level world.This was also his first attempt to completely integrate into a world, with the exception of Silver Moon.In an instant, he seemed to see a huge net enveloping the entire world. Dao law!The powers of the great DAOs were arranged in an orderly manner. Although they had not formed a great Dao universe, they were middle-level worlds and were extremely stable. This also meant that this arrangement was in line with the stability of the fusion of DAOs.At this moment, Li Hao was completely immersed in it.

Chapter 2903 The Most Romantic Thing (1)
The great Dao laws of the medium-level worlds were as dense as a spider web.However, this net was denser than a small world. At this moment, Li Hao realized that he had also opened many small worlds. His small worlds ... Strictly speaking, were actually a rope with some strings attached. Could they barely be considered a net?Alright, it was very forced.Strictly speaking, it couldn't even be considered a net. It could only be considered a branch-shaped plaything. For example, a small fire realm mainly used the great Dao of fire, followed by a few other random DAOs to maintain the existence of this small realm.There wasn't much order, mainly because Li Hao found it difficult to sort it out.He didn't have enough knowledge and insight.As for a true small world, it was a complete net. However, it was very sparse. It was difficult to catch fish if one broke through this net at will.As for the middle-level worlds, the net was very tight, and they could catch big fish and small fish at once.Li Hao had never seen the net of a great world ... The net of a great world might not be a single layer, but a double layer. Like the great Dao universe, it was tightly wrapped around the entire world, both inside and outside.As for the medium-level worlds, that was only on the surface.It was empty inside.This way, there would be one less layer of filter, and the great Dao power in the chaos would not be filtered. This would cause large amounts of impurities to seep into the middle-level worlds. Even middle-level worlds could only cultivate the Dao of chaos and disorder."I see ..."After clearly seeing the net of DAOs in the middle-level worlds, Li Hao suddenly understood what the Dao universe was.This was a layer of filter paper!It was for filtering!Ordinary small and medium-sized worlds would not be able to filter out the impurities when the chaotic energy from the outside seeped in. However, the Dao universe could. This was the essence of the Dao universe.The birth of the great path universe was through cultivation, continuous comprehension, and continuous strengthening. The net of the medium-sized world continued to expand and close. Finally, this large net formed a special secondary world! Li Hao had actually known this ... But he had never clearly sensed it.Today, he suddenly had an epiphany.He completely understood what the universe of the great path was."The world's protective layer, defensive layer, and filtering layer are also a closed space formed by the net of great Dao!"His eyes flickered. In that case, the world and the great Dao universe were still on the same level.No wonder it could be torn apart.He had always felt that the dimensions of the two were different, but today, he had instantly reversed his opinion. No, the dimensions of the two were actually the same, just on a different level!No wonder the chaos was a huge space!Everything, including the great Dao universe and the world, was born in the chaos. This was because the two of them belonged to the same dimension!"I understand!"Li Hao was suddenly very surprised. He had controlled a Dao universe and a world before. Now, he had seen the structure of the great Dao of a small world and a medium world.As for the great worlds ... Tianfang and Senlan were both considered great worlds. Although he had not seen them in detail, he could deduce what the great Dao net of these worlds looked like.Even the net of the great world had been completely integrated into the universe of the great path.Therefore, the DAOs of the big world were all in the great path universe and not outside.In a world with a Dao universe, if you didn't join the Dao universe, you couldn't even cultivate ... Just like the Silver Moon, if you didn't join the Silver Moon great Dao, you couldn't complete your cultivation. If you wanted to cultivate, you had to open your Dao meridians and light up your stars.Of course, if one simply pursued a stronger body, one did not need to open one's meridians or join the Dao universe. However, such a person would not go far in a great world, or a world with a Dao universe.This was because if one couldn't even enter the Dao of chaos and disorder, how could one comprehend it?Unless you entered the primordial chaos to cultivate.It was only one observation, but Li Hao had seen many of them. He had also opened a small world before. For a moment, all kinds of enlightenment emerged in his mind. These were not helpful in improving his strength, but they helped him find a direction again.So, this was how the world worked!It turned out that the law of the great path was like this.When Li Hao cultivated, he always liked to take one step and observe three steps. He preferred to explore the three steps ahead and then cultivate bit by bit according to his own plan, rather than not knowing what to do next after taking one step.Even if he took the wrong path, he could still turn it around in time. Otherwise, if he was eager for quick success, it was very easy for him to take the wrong path and there was no turning back."Dao law, Dao net ... This is a crucial step in forming a world!"Li Hao muttered. As for life, he had some understanding!The source of the world!What was the origin of the world?Why did the origin of the world give birth to life? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  The next moment, he suddenly walked out of the world and stepped into the void. He walked along the darkness, and as he walked ... He seemed to have entered a closed space. In the depths of the world, there was actually something like a heart buried.It seemed to be still beating.It seemed to be alive!Li Hao had seen a lot of monster plants. He had absorbed the vitality of monster plants and the water from the spring of life. However, the moment he stepped into this place, he suddenly realized that the so-called spring of life was nothing!This heart-like thing, every beat ... Would produce countless amounts of energy.

Chapter 2904 The Most Romantic Thing (2)
In fact, it even seemed like it wanted to give birth to life.However, at this moment, this thing seemed to have been sealed.This was the state of a compressed world or a destroyed world. Otherwise, given enough time, even if all the living creatures in this medium-scale world were destroyed, after tens or hundreds of thousands of years, the world would still give birth to new life.At this time, second cat seemed to be thinking about something and floated over.Li Hao had never seen this cat walk.He was like a ghost, floating. Li Hao sometimes suspected that he was too fat and too lazy to walk, so he simply floated.It was the same in the long river.Otherwise, in the river, Li Hao would only have a glance ... And he would have found it comical to swim with his four short legs and fat body!"What are you thinking about?"Ermao looked at him and saw something bad in his eyes. It was a little angry.Li Hao coughed."Nothing. I was just looking at this. Senior second cat, is this the origin of the world?""Yes,"Second cat nodded its huge head and looked at the heart-like thing. It said,"Are you curious how this was born?""Right!"Li Hao nodded. He was indeed curious about how this thing was born."This is the origin of life in this world!"Second cat replied lazily,"simply put, it's a creation machine that creates life!" "It's very complicated ... To be honest, I don't quite understand it either. It's something that only seventh level venerable sovereigns or even stronger venerable sovereigns would study. What I know so far is that when chaos gave birth to a world, the world would give birth to this ... Someone once said that this thing is actually a fusion of Dao. ""A Dao-fused body?"'There's someone 'probably means' fight ', right?"It's all sorts of great DAOs. Through all sorts of methods, a series of changes are completed. It's like a chemical reaction. Finally, this is born. The origin of the world!" Only this could give birth to life and become a real world. Otherwise, a world without life would not be called a world, but a domain! This is the origin of the rank 7 sovereign Dao domain. "Li Hao was enlightened again.So that was how it was!The difference between a Dao domain and a world lay in this-the origin of the world. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  The creator of life!"Then how was this born?"Li Hao mumbled. Second cat said,""Given by the primordial chaos! Perhaps, under specific circumstances and conditions, chaos would naturally give this thing to a world, allowing it to be born! Someone had once said that there were actually some mechanisms in the chaos ... They were very simple, but they did exist! It's also possible that an expert who cultivated the Dao of life to the extreme gave chaos this thing ... But here's the question. If that's the case, how did a Dao of life cultivator who gave chaos life mechanisms come into being?"Second cat shook its head."It's too complicated. The chicken laid the egg and the egg laid the chicken. Which do you think came first? the chicken or the egg?""Chicken first!" Li Hao said matter-of-factly.“……” Second cat was speechless. How did you know?Li Hao explained,"life originates from consciousness. Chickens are a kind of creature with consciousness. Before the egg hatches, it doesn't have consciousness. From what I understand, things with consciousness must be born first." Second cat pouted and his whiskers twitched."Arrogant. Chaos existed from the beginning. Is chaos conscious or unconscious?" Did the chaos come first, or did the living beings in the chaos come first?"“……”"Chaos?" Li Hao was speechless."What if chaos has consciousness?""So ... You're here to prove it?"“……”Alright, Li Hao chose to shut up and pretend I didn't say anything.When it comes to this kind of thing, you have to prove it ... You can only shut up. Of course, second cat can't prove it either.He didn't have the heart to argue. At this moment, he thought of many things."So, er Mao, what you want to absorb is the source of life power?""Yes,"Second cat nodded again. It shook its big head and looked very big, heavy, and fat.Li Hao hadn't paid much attention to it before, but now that he was too close to it ... Looking at its fat head and body, Li Hao felt that it might need to lose weight.After floating for so long, her limbs were about to degenerate. She might become a flying cat soon."Can I study it?""Of course."Second cat laughed. If you want to study it, sure, go ahead.Countless experts wanted to study the source of the world and create life, unlike Li Hao who created a physical body. Which expert did not know how to create a physical body?However, could one give a physical body a true soul and spirituality?No way!For example, you could create weapons, but the process of the weapon giving birth to life was completely dependent on luck. You didn't know what kind of weapon could give birth to life, how to give birth to a spirit ... Even if the weapon gave birth to a spirit, the weapon spirit itself didn't know how it was born.No one could understand!Everything was up to the heavens.Li Hao extended his consciousness and instantly merged with the origin of the world. Countless life forces emerged, and some wills were mixed in. It seemed like a lot of wills. For a moment, Li Hao was a little lost.He tried his best to investigate ... But it seemed to be empty.Li Hao didn't give up. He tried to examine it a few times, but he couldn't find anything he could understand. Li Hao was unwilling to give up. After thinking for a while, he suddenly pointed out a finger.

Chapter 2905 The Most Romantic Thing (3)
Time seemed to be going backward!He wanted to see ... If he could look back and see the origin of this thing.The moment he pointed, Li Hao had a thought ... Perhaps I can also use it on the world and see how it was born, how the great Dao was arranged, whether it was naturally arranged or man-made.The power of time was not actually used to kill people. At this moment, Li Hao had a feeling that if Zhan Tiandi also knew time, his time must have been used to explore the unknown.Time passed by, and many things had disappeared in the passage of time.Perhaps, only time could restore all of this.Therefore, Zhan Tiandi might not have walked out of the neo martial world, but he knew a lot. Perhaps it was because he was constantly looking back to the past and searching for the truth of the past.Such a thought flashed through his mind.The next moment, a scene appeared in Li Hao's mind ... In an instant, his will seemed to shatter, and he was instantly confused. What did he see at that moment?He saw ... Countless DAOs that were so complicated that he almost collapsed!At that moment, it was as if countless Dao laws had merged together. They were as dense as hair and uncountable. He didn't have the time or the ability to see clearly ... In an instant, his will shattered.At this moment, the river and the world shook.The power of a catastrophe instantly appeared on Li Hao's body!It was as if the Thunder of chaos was about to descend. The power of time this time seemed to have broken through the shield of the daylight thief technique. It was as if lightning was about to strike.Li Hao was bleeding from all his orifices!He was too careless!In other words, he had underestimated the origin of the world. All of a sudden, he had backtracked to something incredible. Even just a glance at it had caused him to suffer heavy injuries. Even the sky stealing sun switching technique had been broken.Li Hao instantly sobered up, and his expression turned ugly.At this moment, if the lightning struck ... His identity would be exposed. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  He had only wanted to take a look, but who would have thought that he would see something unimaginable ... Thousands of great DAOs, thousands of true great DAOs, had fused to form the origin of the world.He didn't even have time to see clearly which great DAOs were there. His will seemed to be unable to resist them and was shattered directly.He was just looking back, not borrowing power, nor wandering over. He was just looking at it ...He quickly activated the sky pilfering sun switching technique!He hoped that he would be able to block this lightning tribulation.Otherwise, if the lightning tribulation really did appear, he would be in deep trouble."You've looked too far?"Second cat seemed to have expected this,"Not everything can be looked at randomly. Chaos is very complicated ... If you backtrack randomly, next time, why don't you try to backtrack the origin of chaos?" Are you looking for death?Teaching Li Hao a lesson was also one of its goals.Shi Guang was a good person, but she could not mess around.Li Hao was very good, bold, and meticulous ... But sometimes, he could be reckless. For example, as he had said, this thing had a complicated origin. It was given by chaos and could even trace back to the era when chaos was born.You dare to backtrack?He was really stupid and bold!If you don't believe old cat, you'll be at a disadvantage.Er Mao muttered to himself. Li Hao's face was grave as he kept using a special Dao law, hoping to block and cut off the connection with chaos to avoid the lightning tribulation.Ermao didn't say anything. Suddenly, it didn't float but landed on the ground. Its four short legs jumped and jumped into the source of the world. It opened its mouth and swallowed it!Hualala!It was as if a River had been devoured and a pure energy flowed into its mouth.Second cat seemed to have gained some weight.After eating the origin of the world in one go, Li Hao smacked his lips and his whiskers twitched. The next moment, his cat eyes seemed to be smiling. Suddenly, his whiskers pierced through the void. Li Hao, who was trying hard to shield himself, suddenly felt something.It was as if a weak thread in the void ... Had been broken by something with a crack!The original feeling of a Grand tribulation instantly disappeared.One of ermao's whiskers ... Suddenly broke and turned into dust. The whiskers that were symmetrical on both sides suddenly lost one. It was a funny sight."Senior ... This ..."Second cat looked at him lazily and said,"just cut off the connection. I'm not helping you with your tribulation!" However, the next time you provoke Primal Chaos lightning tribulation, it will accumulate, and just as that fellow said ... You'll be struck to death sooner or later!"Who asked you to mess around every day!Li Hao immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He was also shocked. Second cat ... Could actually block the connection to chaos. Why didn't he show it in the past?Or ... Was it related to the origin of the world?Li Hao turned his head, and his expression changed. He suddenly looked around and saw that the world seemed to have been completely destroyed ... No, not destroyed. At this moment, Li Hao suddenly understood the difference between destruction and death!The world was dead!Li Hao's expression changed. The world was dead!The entire world did not seem to be much different from before, but ... He could feel that the world seemed to have died. At this moment, an aura of death began to fill the entire world.The root of the world had been eaten by er Mao. The world had been in a state of destruction and could be restored at any time. Now, it was completely dead!

Chapter 2906 The Most Romantic Thing (3)
There was no more hope in this world.It could be used as a warehouse or a place to stay. However, this world, compared to the original world ... Could no longer give birth to life. It had lost the ability to give birth to life.The death of the world!If the previous world had been destroyed, this time it was dead. The world itself had not changed much and was still the same. But at this moment, Li Hao sensed silently ... The mountains and rivers, which seemed to have souls, suddenly became empty!It was as if ... The 3D effect had changed to a 2D map. The difference in feeling was not big, but in fact, there was still a difference.Suddenly, Li Hao waved his hand.Lin Hongyu, who had been cultivating in seclusion, suddenly appeared. She opened her eyes and looked at Li Hao in confusion. Li Hao looked back at her and said,""Feel it!"Lin Hongyu did not ask anything. She just quietly sensed around.His face gradually revealed a trace of doubt.After a long time, he slowly said,"strange ... Is this ... A world?""Yes,""How do you feel?" Li Hao nodded. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  "What do you feel?"Lin Hongyu pondered for a long time before she said softly,""It's like ... It's like hell ..."She couldn't tell exactly what it was, but she could feel the aura of death here.All living things were dying!The world was dying."This world is dead!" Li Hao nodded.The world would die?Lin Hongyu was stunned. If the world was not silent or destroyed, what did it mean by the world was dead?Li Hao thought for a moment and said quickly,"let's go. I'll take you to another small world. We missed an opportunity. It's a pity ... Senior second cat, come with us. You can eat another small fish!"Ermao lazily said. It knew what Li Hao was thinking. He wanted to show Lin Hongyu the difference between life and death. Lin Hongyu walked the path of life and death, but her understanding of life and death was ... Very shallow.In fact, Li Hao was similar, but he had more insights and was still better than Lin Hongyu.Li Hao still had a small world. At this moment, a small world appeared.He brought Lin Hongyu and two cats into the small world. Very quickly, he was in front of the source of the world again. Lin Hongyu immediately noticed the problem. She felt two different feelings.This world was alive!It was full of life!She was stunned for a moment. The living world."Senior, eat it!""This is not what I want ..." I only asked for 10. Does the small world count as a gift?"I'll give it to senior to try!""Then I'm going to eat it!"Second cat didn't stand on ceremony, it was good to have a good meal.This time, it stopped jumping when Li Hao saw it. It flew over and landed on the world origin. It opened its mouth and ate it. Li Hao quickly said,""Immerse yourself in the world and sense it!"Lin Hongyu quickly immersed herself in it.In an instant ... In just an instant, the world seemed to have died. The entire world had died.She was shocked!The world would really die!It wasn't broken, it wasn't destroyed, it was dead. This ... This was death?She recalled the feeling she had just experienced ... For a moment, the life and death aura on her body kept fluctuating. She had been cultivating these days. In fact, it was not difficult for her to force her way into stage two. However, she kept feeling that ... It did not seem like the true life and death Dao.Her life and death Dao seemed to be just a decoration. It seemed to be no different from other people's Dao.The power of the life and death Emperor was not reflected at all.In fact, Li Hao didn't show much of it back then. It was just that Li Hao had many tricks up his sleeve, and time was his main force. It was fine if he didn't show it.However, Lin Hongyu was not willing to do so.Because an ordinary venerable Emperor of life and death ... What use was there? he was no different from an ordinary first or second stage venerable Emperor. How could such a venerable Emperor of life and death have the nerve to say that he would die?That was why Li Zhu had also said that Li Hao's understanding of the Dao of life and death was too shallow!It could only provide some life and death Qi!Lin Hongyu actually felt the same way. Everyone said that a life and death Imperial was powerful, but in her opinion, she was a life and death Imperial as well ... Li Hao wasn't even considered one. He was just a bystander who wanted to perfect his time Dao.She was the true venerable sovereign who only cultivated life and death.In the end, she felt that she did not have much of an advantage against the Rogue cultivator Chi, who was also a first stage venerable sovereign. If she were to fight against Chan Xiu, who was a second stage venerable sovereign ... She would probably be no match for her.If a first stage venerable life and death Emperor, who did not cross a major realm and was only in a small realm, could not deal with an ordinary second stage rogue cultivator, then what was the point of being a venerable life and death Emperor?The difficulty of cultivation was even greater. Of course, having a few more lives might be the greatest benefit of life and death.p However, there was a price to pay for his life.At that moment, Lin Hongyu seemed to have found something special about life and death. After a while, she only had a vague understanding, but it felt like there was a layer between them, time and time again. After a long time, the aura on her body changed. The Qi of life and death kept changing, but she frowned.After a while, he looked at Li Hao in distress.""This ... I ... I don't seem to have sensed anything ... Sorry!"She seemed to have wasted an opportunity!In a small world, 10 million great Dao crystals were equivalent to spending the life of a level one venerable sovereign to comprehend it once ... Even a rich second-generation heir could not bear such consumption. In the end, he gained nothing.Li Hao laughed,'if you can understand the essence of life and death on your first try ... Then I'll be an idiot! "That's normal. Take it slow. I don't even understand the Dao of life and death very well. I'll get the hang of it after a few more times. It's just a small world. I'll make a hundred of them later and comprehend them once a day. I don't believe I can't comprehend the true nature of the great Dao!"

Chapter 2907 The Most Romantic Thing (3)
It wasn't like he was wasting anything.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly realized that the world was really fragrant!Er Mao could eat fish, while he and Lin Hongyu could comprehend life and death, the revival of destruction. Not only that, but they could also comprehend the great Dao and provide it to his little realm. They could also give the remaining impurities and unwanted things to the Black Panther to eat.Wasn't a small world much more fragrant than 10 million Dao crystals?It was too cost-effective!Lin Hongyu was still a little depressed. Destroying a world, killing a world, and giving her a sense of life and death ... Only Li Hao was rich and overbearing. In the end, she didn't sense anything, and she was still very disappointed.Seeing this, Li Hao suddenly laughed."It's actually very boring to cultivate in seclusion. Sometimes, what's lacking is a sudden inspiration. It's that flash of inspiration!" I'll take you to do something interesting. " Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  "What?"Lin Hongyu was confused. Suddenly, second cat covered its eyes with its paws and mumbled,""You guys play, I'm not watching."“……”Li Hao was speechless!He couldn't be bothered with this cat. Second cat seemed to be more energetic recently ... It used to be very quiet, but now it talked more and had more thoughts. It was not pure at all."I'll bring you to tear down the world!"Li Hao laughed,"the world is very interesting!" Countless great DAOs gathered into a net ... I'll take you to tear apart the world, tear apart the great DAOs, and then move the power of the great DAOs to my small world ... If possible, I want to backtrack for everyone how the net of the great DAOs was formed. Senior ermao, will this attract the chaotic lightning?""There's a high chance!""You'd better not try that ... Of course, it won't be like before, where lightning strikes instantly. There's a high chance that it'll be blocked, but the next time will be even more powerful!" Second cat said."Then it's fine!" Li Hao smiled.Then, he turned to Lin Hongyu and said,"I'll bring you guys back to the past. Let's see how the net of the great Dao in this world appeared, formed, and constructed. Then, you can participate in it, dismantle it, and rebuild it. This is much more intuitive than comprehending the great Dao."What's the use of looking?Let's just do it. The Dao web is a chemical reaction. We have to experiment and practice it ourselves!Such an opportunity was really not something that everyone could have or grasp. Using the world as a test subject, even a level Seven was not so exaggerated.Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, was a little happy.Some venerable sovereigns might not even have a chance to come into contact with such an opportunity in their entire lives. As for how the Dao net was formed, even seventh or eighth rank venerable sovereigns might not be able to see it in their entire lives, let alone ordinary venerable sovereigns. When a world was born, it was very secretive. Unless it was really by chance, one could not see the process of the world's birth at all."Go! I'll try this small world first ... I'll go back in time and see how the world was born ... Of course, I can't look at the source of the world, but the process of Dao's appearance after the World was born ..."Looking at the source of the world would cost him his life. It would be much easier to see how the net of great Dao was formed after the World was born.Li Hao was also a man of action.The stars of time appeared once again.Now, he used time more to explore the Dao. Even though he had to pay a high price each time, Li Hao was still happy and felt that it was worth it. He always felt that it was a loss when he used time to kill people.The entire world suddenly fell into a state of confusion.Be it second cat or Lin Hongyu, they seemed to have returned to an extremely ancient era with Li Hao ...This kind of arrival was not really going back to the past. If that were the case, Li Hao wouldn't be able to return to countless years ago even if he had ten lives. It was normal for a world to be born hundreds of thousands of years ago at the least, or hundreds of millions of years at the most. Li Hao didn't dare to really descend.Moreover, he was only targeting the Dao net.Soon, the Taoist net disappeared completely in front of everyone. Li Hao showed it to them. Lin Hongyu could also see clearly that the world seemed to be turbid and empty.Gradually, suddenly, a Dao was born.They were like silk threads!That was ... The fire element!Li Hao was a little surprised. He explained,""The first Dao in this world is actually the Dao of fire. It seems that some living being discovered fire ... And used it to create the Dao of fire!"Nothing else appeared in front of him, but Li Hao could guess that after life was born in this world, some living creatures embarked on the path of cultivation, and thus, the Dao of fire was born in this world!A moment later, time passed by very quickly. Suddenly, a second Dao appeared in the void. It was parallel to the first Dao, and there was no contact between them."Death ... Is this ... The Enlightenment of death?"Li Hao was somewhat puzzled. What about life?The source of the world?In this world, he had first comprehended the fire element, then death. The two had never interacted.Then, great Dao started to appear.The cultivation civilization seemed to be on the rise.The Dao web gradually began to weave. Even second cat was watching intently. This kind of small world was directly presented to it. The birth process of the Dao web was presented, but it had never seen it."Yi!"At this moment, Li Hao suddenly exclaimed in a low voice. Looking at the Taoist net, they all noticed some changes.The fire elemental Dao that was originally the first to be born seemed to have experienced some changes. Following that, the line of the fire elemental Dao suddenly pierced through the other great DAOs that had been side by side.

Chapter 2908 The Most Romantic Thing (1)
The fire-type Dao was like a sewing thread. It weaved through the great Dao, weaving through them ... Gradually, the originally sparse grid began to become dense.After an unknown period of time, the Dao net in front of him suddenly underwent a huge change. It was as if the world had advanced, from an unranked world to a small world.At that moment, the fire-type great Dao had already run through all the great DAOs and woven them together. Finally, the two ends of the fire-type great Dao were completely connected!A net, a complete net, appeared!The two humans and one cat looked on in a daze.Li Hao seemed to have noticed something. His eyes flickered. The Dao of fire ... It actually ran through all the great DAOs and showed signs of overlapping with thousands of other DAOs. Thus, this world was the fire elemental world.So that was how it was!BOOM!Everything before his eyes shattered, and the void returned to its original state. The Dao net disappeared, but in fact, no one could see it. Li Hao could see it because he had integrated into this world and become its master.At this moment, Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He looked at Lin Hongyu."Do you see the order? I'll bring you to dismantle ... Then, we'll go to my little world of fire and try to combine it again. We don't necessarily have to follow the order, but we have the same idea. How about we combine my world of fire?"Lin Hongyu was a little excited and nodded.Everything that had just happened ... Was shocking to her. The world actually had a Dao net, and in the end, the Dao net of the world had actually completed the combination of various DAOs. That was something she had never imagined.At this moment, Li Hao waved his hand, and a net of great Dao seemed to appear between heaven and earth!The net of great Dao was invisible and intangible. How could ordinary people tear it apart?However, Li Hao let out a low shout at this time. His Dao domain appeared and covered the area with his fire element domain, forcibly condensing the Dao net. He revealed a look of joy. Pieces of bedazzling crystals shattered, and suddenly, the Nirvana Dao net was forcibly presented.The great Dao crystal was burning wildly!It consumed a lot of energy!Li Hao didn't care. He rose into the air, and Lin Hongyu quickly followed. Seeing this, second cat wanted to follow, but after some consideration, decided not to.How romantic!For some reason, it felt so romantic ... Breaking the Dao of the world with his fiancée was very much in line with a cultivator's character.Moreover, he was the kind of cultivator who was versatile ... For example, the neo martial artist King. Would he think of taking his wife to tear down the net of the great path?He would split the world in half!What a boorish fellow!Second cat thought to himself, and then thought of big cat ... Big cat only knew how to roar at the side. After eating the world, it didn't care about what the Dao net was at all ... Big cat was also a reckless cat!……In the void, Li Hao carefully followed the memories he had seen before and presented a trace of fire elemental power. He found the source of the great Dao of fire and carefully cut it off.The great Dao ... With a crack, it really broke.At this moment, the Dao net was somewhat turbulent.Li Hao, on the other hand, was overjoyed. As expected, he moved the Path of Fire and warned,""I'll dismantle the fire elemental Dao. I'll dismantle one Dao, and you'll take the other. You must be careful. Otherwise, if you take a wrong step and break the thread, it'll be a mess ...""I ... I'm afraid I can't do it ..." Lin Hongyu was also excited and nervous."Yes, you can. If you can 't, even if this world is gone, there's still a medium-sized world that you can demolish!" Li Hao carefully stripped away the fire-type Dao, and Lin Hongyu followed suit. Carefully, she released a weak Dao power and peeled away the great Dao that she had stripped away bit by bit. When the great Dao landed in her hands, she actually felt a weak comprehension of the Dao laws surging into her mind.Li Hao also gained a lot from their cooperation ...Li Hao was overjoyed after dismantling dozens of them.Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, was careless and her Dao force shifted. The next moment, the entire Dao net collapsed!Boom! Boom! Boom!Lin Hongyu's expression changed. Li Hao glanced at her and smiled.""Don't just stand there. Watch the fireworks ... When you're done, you can also comprehend destruction!""I ..."Lin Hongyu wanted to say something, but Li Hao chuckled. He looked at the net seriously and said,""So beautiful! The obliteration of the Dao ... The beauty of destruction! "In addition, you were still a little unfamiliar when you tore apart the net of Dao previously. This means that your control over the various DAOs is very weak. Of course, you major in life and death, but you can comprehend the other DAOs appropriately."Lin Hongyu nodded slightly. At this moment, she looked at Li Hao's side profile ... And suddenly felt very peaceful.They didn't have much interaction with each other.This time, they had only experienced the destruction of the world, life and death, and the formation and destruction of the Dao web. Li Hao had not said anything sweet to them.However, at this moment, she felt sweet in her heart.Why did cultivators feel that ... Even if they were just destroying the great Dao, it was still so romantic and beautiful?Lin Hongyu looked at Li Hao in silence, then at the destroyed Taoist net.I've wasted so many opportunities, and even wasted an entire world's network of Dao. Li Hao ... Didn't even say a word of dissatisfaction. He only consoled me casually, but it was very satisfying.For a moment, she was a little dazed.Who said that the great Dao was heartless?Dao, emotions.Cultivators lived and died after cultivating. Weren't their emotions manifested in their Dao?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.So ... This was the life and death of Dao ...  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  At this moment, an aura of life and death vaguely emerged from his body and surrounded him. It did not build a bridge of Life and death like Li Hao, but a Star of Life and death in Li Hao's River quietly grew stronger. He absorbed a large amount of great Dao's power. Suddenly, his aura changed. It was so natural that the aura of a rank two actually appeared!A thought of life and death!Lin Hongyu looked at Li Hao silently."I can decide my life and death with a single thought. My life, my Dao's life and death, the world's life and death ... What if I didn't choose to surrender when I met Li Hao that day and continued to oppose him?"Perhaps ... That would be a matter of life and death!The corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.Who said that the Dao of life and death was the beginning and the end of life?A single thought was the beginning of life and death!

Chapter 2909 A Storm Is Coming (1)
Everyone's comprehension of Dao Arts was different.Li Hao did not understand Lin Hongyu's perception of life and death, but he noticed that Lin Hongyu's aura had reached Level 2.Rank two was nothing.However, he didn't absorb much energy and directly stepped into the second rank. This meant that he had made quite a bit of progress in his comprehension of Dao techniques.Many venerable sovereigns dreamed of using Dao techniques to improve their realms."Congratulations!"Li Hao turned around and smiled.Rank two was enough.The venerable sovereigns from Silvermoon had all improved. Black Panther and the others had all reached rank three. Of course, that was also due to the influence of their own fruit ranks. Lin Hongyu was not a World Master or a master of the great Dao, so it was not bad for her to reach rank two so quickly.Lin Hongyu smiled as well.Second rank!She knew that it was only a matter of time before she reached the second level. It was not difficult for her to reach the third level. The real difficulty was to step into the middle level and then the advanced level ... If she did not have a deeper understanding of the Tao technique, it would be impossible for her to step into the fourth level.But today, she had a deeper understanding of life and death.Life and death!At this moment, she suddenly stretched out her hand, and a faint life force appeared on her finger.A moment of beauty!Li Hao was dazed. In just a moment, one of the great Dao nets that had been destroyed suddenly emerged, as if time had been turned back.However, in the next moment, the great path was surrounded by a deathly aura. With a crack, it shattered again.Lin Hongyu was a little dazed. Then, her joy faded and she said regretfully,"I was still thinking if I could revive these great DAOs, but ... I failed."Resurrection?Li Hao was stunned again. He looked at her. What kind of joke was this?The great Dao has been destroyed, and you want to resurrect?Is this something you can do?However, Li Hao's heart was still moved."You resurrected the dead great Dao for a moment and exploded with the last brilliance ...""I guess so."Lin Hongyu nodded, but she was still regretful.It was only for an instant!What was the use of a moment of beauty?This time, he failed to meet his expectations again.Li Hao, on the other hand, was distracted. He looked at her and didn't say anything for a long time.After a while, Li Hao said,"I'm saying if ... If we fight with a venerable sovereign and kill one of them, there will be another. Can you resurrect the venerable sovereign we killed and burst into a moment of glory?" Lin Hongyu was stunned and fell into deep thought. After a while, she said,""I don't know. I'm still not sure how long this instant of resurrection can last ... I'm also not sure if I can resurrect the other party, what the conditions are, and what the limits are to resurrecting the other party ..."Li Hao, on the other hand, was deep in thought.Lin Hongyu was able to revive a broken great Dao for a moment ... This was interesting.The great Dao often represented the venerable sovereign level.This also meant that if a venerable sovereign died, Lin Hongyu could resurrect him for a moment within a certain period of time. Of course, whether this moment would be useful or not was still unknown.After being resurrected, it was unclear if the other party was still conscious or not.As for whether or not he could control the other party, he was still not sure.Everything was unknown!It was not easy to test this. Where could he find venerable sovereigns to kill and then revive them for testing?If what Li Hao said was true ... Once many venerable sovereigns besieged them, and they killed one of them, who would guard against the one who died on their side?At that time, it would be best if he could be instantly resurrected and listen to orders. If he couldn 't, he would just explode. That wouldn't be easy. Perhaps, it could save his life."This life and death technique of yours ..."Li Hao was a little confused. He had tried it too. He would die too. Lin Hongyu had grown up with him.He had tried it out ... Revive my a * s.The great Dao shattered and didn't move at all.Strange!At this moment, Li Hao had other thoughts. This magic was really strange. They were both on the same path of life and death. He was a rank four, but he couldn't do what Lin Hongyu, who was a rank two, could.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  His own Dao of life and death was mainly focused on his own recovery.To outsiders, the Dao of life and death wasn't very effective. Of course, it could provide vitality and use the aura of death. According to Li Zhu, who he had met that day, Li Hao's life and death could only be used to replenish his vitality and so on.As for the more mysterious way to use it, Li Hao couldn 't.Lin Hongyu was about to say something when Li Hao waved his hand.""Dao techniques depend on one's comprehension. It's not that I don't know how to live and die. Since I can't use it, it means that my comprehension is different from yours. There's no need to explain it to me in detail."Even if he went on, he might not be able to learn it.Li Hao laughed again."The demolition here has failed. All that's left is an empty shell. I'll feed this empty shell to the Black Panther later."“……”Lin Hongyu could not help but laugh.The Black Panther ate.This empty shell was a treasure to many venerable sovereigns. In fact, what venerable sovereigns devoured were mainly empty shells and the origin of the world.As for the Dao net ... Li Hao only felt that it was useful. For venerable sovereigns, they couldn't look back to the past and see the truth of the Dao net. If they wanted to tear it apart, it would explode. The Dao net was almost useless to them.It was clearly a treasure, but in Li Hao's eyes, it was an empty shell, as if a Black Panther was only worthy of eating garbage.
