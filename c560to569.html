If the night patrolman building was an old antique ...
 The venue of the press conference would look very modern.
 The huge Hall was brightly lit, the seats were comfortable, and there were tea and desserts.
 The first floor was reserved for the ordinary seating, and there were actually some private rooms on the second floor. He didn't know which auction hall they had borrowed, but they were still a little mysterious.
 Some people from big forces, some experts, and a few important organizations had also arrived. However, they went directly to the private rooms on the second floor, which attracted some people's attention, but no one said anything.
 Li Hao had been sitting in the center of the stage for a long time.
 On both sides, there were also people holding the line.
 Minister Zhou was sitting on the left. This existence at the peak of the sunlit realm seemed to have undergone some transformation after entering the remains this time. He might be transforming toward the three suns.
 And on Li Hao's right sat Wang Ming ...
  Li Hao found it very strange that this guy could get a seat. Did he use his connections last night?
 Just the three of them.
 Hao lianchuan and chief Yu were not here.
 From the looks of it, he didn't seem to pay much attention to it.
 In the hall, many martial masters had arrived. He Yong had the right to go upstairs, but he didn 'T. He sat in the first row and looked very excited as he stared at Li Hao.
 Li Hao's gaze swept across everyone in the hall.
 Almost all of them were martial masters, but there were also a few non-martial masters. He didn't know how they had managed to get in.
 On the second floor, the private rooms were mostly filled with orbs.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Obviously, most of them were supers. Those without orbs might be martial masters douqian.
 He even saw a very familiar ball of light ... Hong Yitang!
 He did not expect the headmaster of swords gate to be here.
 "The second floor is full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers! There's actually five or six of the three suns, and ... Is that Xuguang?"
 Li Hao glanced at the second floor. So many powerhouses had arrived without a sound.
 Also, what was Hao lianchuan doing on the second floor?
 Not only did he see the familiar ball of light from Hong Yitang, but there was also another person he was familiar with-Hu dingfang. Moreover, there might be someone else in the room ... Perhaps it was that Senior Sister he had never met.
 Since the military was here, it seemed like the administrative Bureau was here as well.  After waiting for a while, Minister Zhou coughed and said,""Everyone's here. Let's cut to the chase. Li Hao just arrived yesterday and isn't familiar with everyone, so there's no need for an introduction. Later, Li Hao will directly call your names. If you're called, you can directly ask some questions. He will answer whatever he can!"
 "As for those that you can't answer, or those that you can't answer, don't force it!"
 "Everyone wants to see a new path as a Martial Master. I believe that Li Hao wouldn't deliberately keep it a secret or simply say it!"
 After a few simple words, department head Zhou looked at Li Hao and said,""If you can answer, please do your best to satisfy everyone. In addition, some Martial Master orthodoxies from the central continent have come this time. They may have some in-depth questions to ask ... If you don't want to answer them on the spot, you can communicate with them later."
 As soon as he said that, many people's eyes flickered.
 Are there any other powerful martial masters from the central continent?
 Li Hao smiled."There's no need for private communication. My master once said that in martial arts, except for the core techniques of our sect, you can tell me everything you know! As a Martial Master, no one wanted to see the decline of the Martial Master path! As long as you don't ask me about the breathing technique of five birds, I will tell you everything I know!"
 As soon as he said that, someone immediately cheered,""That's reasonable! "On the path of martial arts, other than the core law, everyone should interact more to improve themselves. You are not new here. If anyone dares to ask about the core law, that would be deliberately looking for trouble. There is no such rule in the pugilistic world! To steal someone's heart technique is to exterminate the entire family. Those who ask this are fake martial masters. Such people should be killed!"
 Many martial masters agreed with him.
 Although everyone coveted the breathing technique of five birds, as Li Hao and the others had said, whoever deliberately asked this question was deliberately looking for trouble. It was only right for them to fight and kill each other on the spot for a life-and-death feud.
 ……
 On the second floor.
 In the private room.
 Hu dingfang frowned slightly. After a long while, he glanced at the beauty beside him and whispered,""Is the core law ... Really ... Really that important?"
 He was a Martial Master, but he did not fully understand these things.
  He was a Martial Master from the military.
 On the other hand, the military had collected many core laws and shared them.
 He knew that the breathing technique of five birds was very important, but when he learned it, the martial arts world was almost gone. He knew the rules of a Martial Master, but he had not experienced it personally.
 Today, however, he had a different feeling.
 The group of martial masters immediately resonated with Li Hao when he said that the core law should not be revealed. It was as if anyone who dared to mention it would be killed by everyone!
 The beauty beside him didn't say anything and only nodded slightly.
 Hu dingfang did not say anything else.
 Below, Li Hao continued,"my master once printed a book on the five birds technique and spread it everywhere. Many people know it. It doesn't matter. The five birds technique can strengthen your body. It's a good thing for everyone to comprehend it and make our five birds sect famous!"
 "But there's one thing I want to say."
 Li Hao stood up and cupped his fists."There are many people who know the five birds technique. Some of them even created their own unique ways. It's normal for them to modify their breathing technique to match it." However, whether it was killing or sparring, the five birds technique could not be used in formal occasions! Even if you use it, you must leave your own unique symbol. Otherwise, outsiders will think that my master killed people for no reason, and that my five birds sect killed people for no reason!"

 "My five birds sect only has me and my master now. As for the disciples that my master had taken in in the past, they have gradually dispersed. He did not pursue the secret technique of five birds. However, these people must not use the name of my five birds sect to do anything sneaky!"
 Li Hao said seriously,"whether it's me or my teacher, as martial masters, if you kill someone, you kill them. But if five birds sect kills someone, they dare to take responsibility for their actions!" In the future, if you see someone using the five birds technique to kill someone other than us, then it will have nothing to do with our five birds sect! You can kill or annihilate them, but don't drag my five birds sect into this!"
 The group of martial masters below didn't have much of a reaction.
 Some of the private rooms above were whispering.
 These words ... Why did they sound so targeted?
 ……
 Hu dingfang didn't say anything. The beauty beside him sighed, looked at Hu dingfang, and whispered,""You ... Did you use the five animal technique in front of him?"
 Hu dingfang nodded.
 Chen Yuhua was silent for a while, then said,""Next time ... Try not to use it. You've become a superpower. Although the five birds technique is still very strong, superpowers have their own superpower skills. Don't use it unless it's necessary."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Yes."
  Hu dingfang didn't say anything. Obviously, Li Hao was probably talking to him.
 ……
 In the hall.
 Li Hao didn't continue. Instead, he pointed at Southern Fist."Senior Southern Fist, you're an old senior of Silver Moon martial forest. You can ask me a question!"
 Nanquan laughed and said directly,""The art of accumulating spirit, is it related to the five internal organs?"
 As soon as he said that, all the martial masters widened their eyes and stared at him.
 He was heading straight for the core!
 Li Hao nodded."That's right. At the very least, my teacher's method of accumulating spirit is related to the five internal organs. I don't know about the others, but accumulating the five internal organs is a sign of accumulating spirit. The five internal organs are strong, and that is the foundation of accumulating spirit!"
 Nan Quan still wanted to ask more questions, but Li Hao pointed to another person. That Martial Master was extremely excited and hurriedly said,""How to strengthen the five internal organs?"
 Li Hao smiled."Two methods. First, use your inner strength to nourish your five internal organs. It will take you ten years, twenty years, or even a lifetime. "Second, take the blood God. One sun glory realm Blood God can save you five years. Two will save you ten years ..."
 As soon as these words were spoken, the entire Hall was in an uproar.
 Some people were impatient and wanted to ask directly, but Li Hao didn't give them the chance. He shouted,""Don't worry, everyone. I'm sure you've all heard of the blood deity. Does anyone here have a blood deity with them?"
 The moment he said that, it was quiet.
 ? It didn't matter if he had it or not, it wasn't appropriate for him to take it out in public.
 Perhaps there was someone from the red moon.
 At this moment, Nanquan laughed out loud."I have one that's at the glorious sun tier. Do you have a special method to make us consume it? I've absorbed one before, and the effect is very good, but it didn't reach the level you mentioned ..."
 "That's because the breathing technique is different!"
 Li Hao smiled."Since you have it, senior ... That's great!"  "Everything depends on the results. It's useless to talk," he said.
 "Senior, can you give me the blood deity?"
 He Yong didn't hesitate and directly threw a blood pill over. Li Hao felt it and felt that it wasn't weak. Very good. At the very least, it was created by a red shadow in the middle stage of the sun glory realm. It was probably created by the royal family.
 It seemed that the royal family was also prepared.
 Li Hao smiled."You're a warrior Qian, senior. I won't test it on you. Are you willing to let me test this Blood God?"
 "Of course, as you wish!"
 He Yong didn't care. It was best if he could see some results with his own eyes.
 Li Hao glanced at the crowd. After a while, he pointed at a young man who was about 20 years old. Judging from his muscles, steps, and state, he was probably a Martial Master at the peak of the tenth level.
 Of course, he was not sure.
 "Junior Brother, come up for a moment."
 The young man who was called out was a little confused and a little excited. He quickly walked up.
 In the crowd, the sound of discussion quickly rose."This ... Whose is this?"
 "I don 't."
 "I know him. He's the inheritor of the iron Palm. He's the youngest disciple. He's not old, but he's already at the peak of the tenth realm."
 "Oh, so he's his disciple!"
 Very quickly, someone recognized that person's identity.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, heard the man's words, but he didn't care. He glanced at the man and said with a smile,""You haven't broken a hundred yet, have you?"
  "No, I don't ..."
 "If you consume this Blood God, breaking through 100 will only take an instant. Not only that, but it can also strengthen your five organs. Soon, you'll be able to break through the middle stage of 100, or even the late stage. However, perfection will depend on your own comprehension of Shi ..."
 The man was stunned for a moment, then became excited.""This ... Really?"
 "Try it and you'll know!"
 Li Hao picked up the blood God, which was in the solar illumination realm, and said with a smile,""There's too much energy in this Blood God's fruit for you, so it's best not to eat it if you're alone. However, I'm also over a hundred, so I'll use the five birds breathing technique to help you digest it ..."
 The next moment, Li Hao stuffed the blood God into the man's mouth.
 The moment the energy burst out, he struck out with his palm. Without waiting for the other party to come back to his senses, he activated the breathing technique of five birds.
 Not only that, but he had also used a little bit of sword energy.
 In any case, this guy couldn't feel it. He would only feel that the breathing technique of five birds was extremely magical.
 In an instant, a large amount of blood-colored energy spread out.

 In the blink of an eye, the other party's inner strength surged, and his face turned red.
 Not long after, he roared and struck out with his palm. His inner strength exploded and was directly released!
 At that moment, everyone in the hall was dumbfounded.
 It broke a hundred?
 How was that possible?
 "Are there any martial masters who have surpassed 100 who are willing to fight him?" Li Hao asked directly."He's still digesting energy, but his five internal organs and body have been strengthened. He's even stronger than ordinary martial masters who have surpassed 100 ..."
 "I'll do it!"
 Very soon, someone jumped out from the crowd.
 In the blink of an eye, the two martial masters had started fighting. The young man who had consumed the blood shadow was in urgent need of venting his anger. In addition, he was so agitated that he kept striking out with his iron palms.
 However, he was still lacking in experience and was kicked several times by the other party. Everyone saw it with their own eyes. The other party's internal organs seemed to have become much stronger.
  Such a violent kick only caused some injuries to the other party. His internal organs did not seem to have any major problems.
 All of a sudden, everyone became fanatical.
 They were still fighting when someone impatiently said,""Then ... Only the breathing technique of five birds can digest it?"
 "No, almost all breathing techniques are fine. It's just that it wastes a lot of energy. The breathing technique of five birds will absorb more energy from the blood God."
 This time, Li Hao didn't wait for them to ask. He said directly,""For those who have broken through 100, it's actually a waste to absorb the Scion of the blood God. If it's a warrior's Qian, a large amount of energy will be directly integrated into the five internal organs and strengthen them. This will be more helpful for everyone to break through to the spirit accumulation stage."
 "How can I step into the spirit accumulation realm after strengthening my five internal organs?" He Yong's eyes flickered.
 Li Hao laughed."I'm not too sure about the details, but I do know that after the five internal organs are well-nourished, if the force is strong enough, it can try to enter the five internal organs. However, there's a difficulty in doing so. It's easy to cause the five internal organs to go out of balance and directly cause the internal organs to explode, causing death!"
 He Yong frowned. After a long while, he said,"that's right. I actually tried it before, but ... The moment the force entered my five internal organs, I felt an explosive feeling!"
 He had tried!
 Or rather, many people had actually tried it before. Once the heart fire ape appeared, everyone wasn't stupid, so how could they not guess something?
 However, he could not!
 Li Hao thought for a moment."I heard my teacher mention it once. There's a key to this, but he didn't go into detail. It's said that only this key can help people enter the spirit accumulation stage!"
 That was force lock!
 Super Lock!
 No one knew about this, and no one dared to try it. Martial masters only tried at the warrior level, and it was not difficult for a warrior master at the warrior level to become a super. However, since they had not become a super, they did not dare to touch the Super Lock.
  However, without the Super Lock, it was impossible to successfully lock in force.  This caused these martial masters to be unable to lock in their Shi to nurture it even though they knew it was related to the five internal organs.
 At this moment, a voice came from the second floor. Someone asked,""Five internal organs and five Forces, must there be Five Forces?"
 If that was the case, then it would be meaningless.
 Li Hao shook his head."Not necessarily. If there's only one type of force ... I'll say the same thing again. I don't know much about my teacher's research, but I know one thing. Even if I comprehended sword force, my teacher didn't say anything. It's not impossible for me to represent one type of force! It's not impossible for the five internal organs to accumulate power, but I still need my teacher to explain the specific way ..."
 "Is there no other way other than the Scion of the blood God?" the man on the second floor asked.
 That was Hong Yue's exclusive weapon. If that was the case, he could only fight with Hong Yue and use an origin divine weapon.
 This was not good news!
 Li Hao continued,"I don't know, but my teacher is trying to modify the breathing technique of five birds. If he succeeds, he might be able to directly nourish the five internal organs. Even if the speed is a little slower, there might still be hope. But my teacher has left, and I can't answer everyone's doubts now."
 As soon as he said that, many people's eyes flickered.
 Modifying the breathing technique of five birds?
 When the time came, would the success be spread?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Another person's voice came from the second floor.""Inspector li, did professor Yuan mention anything to you before he left?"
 "There are!"
 Li Hao was very honest. He said directly,"my teacher told me once. Don't mix the elements of the five internal organs. Water should fuse with the kidney, and fire should fuse with the heart." "But the five organs are fragile. If you want your five organs to meet the conditions for nourishment, you have to pay attention to one thing. Only when your five organs are strong enough that the force can enter your five organs without shattering or bleeding is the basic requirement. Once this happens, immediately stop the force fusion!"
  This time, even he Yong frowned and said in a deep voice,""It's hard to strengthen the five internal organs. Even if I've taken countless treasures, my five internal organs will still bleed instantly ... Can the divine power Stone strengthen the five internal organs?"
 "Yes, but the effect is not as good as the blood God. The blood God is more suitable for martial masters. As for the divine stone, it needs different attributes."
 Li Hao said,"I was injured by someone before. Department head Hao gave me a wood energy stone. I used it to repair my internal organs. The result was satisfactory. Although it's not as good as the blood God, it's still much stronger than the mysterious energy."
 He Yong let out a breath. Damn it, the divine power Stone was not even as good as the blood God. What else could he say?
 “……”
 Everyone's questions came one after another.
 Li Hao answered honestly.
 In the end, everyone was too embarrassed to ask any more questions. If they continued, they would ask about the breathing technique of five birds.
 Li Hao's mouth was dry, and he took a sip of water.
 At that moment, Wang Ming, who was next to him, said in a low voice,"Li Hao, can't the breathing technique of five birds be taught to outsiders?"

 Li Hao glared at him and said in a low and weak voice,""Of course not! "Unless you kill me and take away my secret technique manual, don't even think about it. Also, don't have any crooked thoughts. I've hidden this secret technique, and you'll die if you cultivate it rashly. Only a large part of the five birds breathing technique is recorded, and a small part is still in my head ... Don't even think about it!"
 Wang Ming said embarrassedly,"how could that be? but ... Why do you have it on you? isn't it dangerous?"
 "Nonsense, do you think he's hiding it at home? But don't worry, it's only half of it. Even if we lose it, it won't be leaked out. You'RE teacher's in-name disciple, so perform well and I'll show you. "
 "Alright!"
 Their voices were extremely low, so Minister Zhou didn't hear clearly what they were saying and didn't care.
 ……
 However, at this moment, the ears of the three suns experts on the second floor quivered slightly.
 In a private room.
 Hu dingfang's expression changed slightly. This idiot!
 He looked at Chen Yuhua and asked,"do you have a secret copy of the breathing technique of five birds?"
  Chen Yuhua looked at him and said,""I used to have one, but I don't know about it anymore. Why do you ask? if you know it, do you still need a secret manual?"
 "No, that Junior Brother of yours ... Did he really think that no one could hear what he said? He brought the secret manual with him ..."
 "What?"
 Chen Yuhua was stunned. Why did he bring the secret manual?
 There weren't many words on the five birds breathing technique. It mainly consisted of some movements and breathing methods. Once you've learned it, you can just destroy the secret book. What's the use of carrying it?
 The next moment, his expression changed slightly.
 "En!"
 Hu dingfang frowned."He's speaking very softly. But what's the strength of three suns? as long as we listen carefully, we should be able to hear something ..."
 After saying that, the two of them frowned.
 This was not a good thing!
 The more Li Hao displayed the effect of the five birds breathing technique, the more excited he was.
 Even if it was a superpower, it was still very tempting.
 If this continued, he would be in big trouble.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As he spoke, his ears twitched slightly as he heard some other sounds.
 "Li Hao, you have a sunguang-level Blood God's child ... Why don't you give me one? hou bu gave me ten. It's not a big loss to give me one. I'll buy it ..."
 "Shut up, lower your voice. The outside world doesn't know about this. There seems to be an expert on the second floor. Don't let anyone eavesdrop. Your mouth is really big. "
 "Tsk, we're speaking so softly. Don't treat him like a god. What can you hear? what are you afraid of? Kill them with one shot. "
 "You ... Forget it, I'm not going to talk to you anymore."
 The conversation between the two came to an end.
 Hu dingfang's face darkened. After a while, he sent a voice transmission,""He also has a Sunglow Blood God bead!"
 Chen Yuhua's expression changed when she heard this.
 The breathing technique of five birds and the Son of Blood God Xuguang were a perfect match!
 If it were him, he would be tempted too.
 If they killed Li Hao ... They would be rich.
 As for the incomplete secret art, some senior martial masters might be able to deduce the other half even if they got half of the secret art. Don't underestimate those senior martial masters.  At that moment, Chen Yuhua had a headache.
 This Junior Brother of his ... Was too stupid.
 More importantly, she did not know how many people had heard it.
 Hu dingfang was in the late stage of three yang realm, so he heard it. What about the others?
 "Pay attention to the reactions of the other private rooms ..."
 As she was speaking, Hu dingfang frowned slightly.""No reaction. It's very quiet ... Maybe ... Maybe no one heard us. We've been paying attention to Li Hao, so we're a little concerned. The others might not have noticed."
 Even though he said that, he still frowned.
 He had to remind Li Hao and the night patrolmen about this. Did they really think that no one would dare to take the risk with hou Xiaochen around?
 Young man ... What a big mouth!
 He had to tell everyone about everything.
 There was also that Wang Ming. He now knew that he was the grandson of the White Dragon Army's vice Commander-in-Chief. When he'd asked around about this person before, he'd learned that he had a big mouth. This mouth wasn't the usual kind of big mouth, and he would spill everything.
 ……
 But at this moment, Wang Ming acted as if nothing had happened.
 He was only thinking about who Li Hao was going to screw over this time. If he died, would he be able to get some credit?
 His reputation as a big mouth would probably never be washed clean.
 Of course, it didn't matter.
 He didn't care about this!
 He glanced at the second floor from the corner of his eye, then at the other people in the hall. He didn't know who Li Hao's target was, nor did he know how many people would take the bait. This guy, he's doing bad things on his first day in Silvermoon City. What a jerk!
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was still conscientious and sincerely explaining the situation to everyone.
 The blood God and the breathing technique of five birds were mainly the work of these two.
 The more they listened, the more they felt that they had to get it in order to let everyone enter the resting spirit state.
 Of course, if he was confident, he didn't need the breathing technique of five birds. The effect would be the same even if he had more clones of Blood God.
 In the end, when it was time to leave, the big mouth Wang Ming lowered his voice again."Li Hao, did Hu dingfang practice the breathing technique of five birds? I heard from Hao bu that he stole your family's Secret technique and reached the late-stage three-yang realm in one or two years. That's why he can use superpowers and have particularly strong effects, right?"
 "Shut up, don't talk nonsense, don't spread rumors!"
  Li Hao scolded in a low voice. He was a little angry and said in a low voice,"If you say any more nonsense, don't be with me in the future. You're too annoying!"
 "Alright, I won't talk anymore!"
 On the second floor, Hu dingfang was a little embarrassed, a little helpless, and a little annoyed. This Wang Ming ... Really deserved a beating!
 'Also, if these two silly kids continue talking like this, it's over. Not only will the martial masters be tempted, but even the superpowers will be tempted!'
 With a sigh, Hu dingfang was a little vexed. If he had known earlier, he would have interrupted them when they finished their first sentence.
 ……
 In another private room.
 Hao lianchuan yawned and revealed a smile ... This guy was not afraid of attracting a big fish. He was risking his life to fish!
 Since that was the case ... He would just have to fish properly.
 He silently retreated. Presumably, the news would soon reach the ears of some people.

 In the hall.
 Li Hao conscientiously answered all the questions for everyone. Except for those that he couldn't answer, he told them everything he knew.
 Until the last moment.
 In the hall, someone suddenly hesitated, but still spoke up,""My young friend Li Hao, is it really impossible to teach the breathing technique of five birds to outsiders?"
 At this point, there were still people who wanted to ask and give it a try.
 Can it be passed on?
 When martial arts were weak, perhaps ... They would be willing to spread it?
 Li Hao was in a difficult position. After thinking for a while, he said,""No! At least not now. Unless my master is willing, I can't make the decision. And my master ... It's not entirely impossible!"
 Li Hao thought for a while and said,"everyone knows master better than I do. He's stubborn, but he's also willing to return the favor. A drop of kindness should be returned with a spring!"
  "There are some things I'll be frank with you. My master isn't showing himself now because he's hiding from danger. If my uncles encounter or see it when they return and are willing to help my master when he is in danger ... Why can't I pass on the breathing technique of five birds?"
 Li Hao also said bluntly,"you're about to lose your life, so why do you still care about this?" If anyone saves my master, my master is really unwilling to teach the breathing technique of five birds. If you come to me, I'll teach it to you even if I have to anger my master to death!"
 The moment these words came out, it caused a slight commotion in the crowd again.
 Save Yuan Shuo?
 Yes, the current Yuan Shuo was very strong, but no matter how strong he was, he was still not at the level where he could rival Xu Guang.
 If Yuan Shuo really went to the central region to take revenge on Hong Yue, maybe ... He would really meet her. If the situation allowed it, it was not impossible to save her.
 A Martial master's promise was still very valuable.
 At that time, not to mention the breathing technique of five birds, he might even be able to obtain better things.
 "Understood!"
 The Martial Master who asked the question smiled.""If master Yuan is really in the central region and is in danger, as a Martial Master, I won't leave him to die!"
 "Thank you, everyone!" Li Hao cupped his fists.
 After saying that, he finally said,"everyone, I've already explained everything that I can. If there's anything that you don't understand, I can't do anything about it!" "Finally, although I have a grudge against Hong Yue, I'd like to remind everyone that the blood God illusions are invisible. There's no other way to take them except for the origin divine weapon. Everyone, don't take any risks for the sake of the blood God. The best way isn't to kill the Crimson Moon experts, but to work together and force the Crimson Moon to hand over the method to raise the blood deity!"
 Li Hao laughed and said,"this is the foundation!" "If we can cultivate blood deities, we martial masters will have a way out! I, Li Hao, am here today to say something on behalf of my master. If Hong Yue is willing to hand over the cultivation method, as long as it's true and suitable for the public ... My five birds sect's five birds breathing technique can also be shared, so that we can contribute to the development of martial arts!"
 The entire Hall and the second floor fell silent. This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com When Li Hao mentioned the blood God, some people were actually thinking that if Hong Yue was willing to share the method, it would still be a bit unreliable. Why didn't she let Yuan Shuo share the breathing technique of five birds?
 In the end ... Li Hao actually added that it could be shared too!
 This time, some people couldn't sit still and hurriedly said,""Can you make the promise on behalf of your master?"
 If everyone worked together, it might not be impossible.
 Hongyue was clearly in trouble and danger right now. Ying Hongyue might not be able to hold on stubbornly for long. If they joined forces to force him to hand over the plan, there was still hope of success.
 At that time, if the breathing technique of five birds also appeared ... It would be a perfect match!
 Li Hao nodded and said in a deep voice,"as long as the method is real and the Scion of blood can be cultivated, I can make this decision on behalf of my master!" If you don't believe me, I can use the night patrolman as a guarantee! If Ying Hongyue dared to share it, would our five birds sect be reluctant to part with a secret technique?"
 "However, without a plan, once the breathing technique of five birds is spread, the only one who will benefit will be Hong Yue. No matter how stupid we are, we won't let Hong Yue take advantage of us!"
 Everyone thought about it and agreed.
 If the breathing technique of five birds was really spread out, but no one would cultivate the blood God, and the Crimson Moon Society would ... Wouldn't the Crimson Moon suddenly become stronger?
 "Little friend li is a righteous man!"
 "Indeed. Since the method of raising the blood deity is beneficial to martial masters, I think it is necessary to try it. Ying Hongyue of Hongyue was also a Martial Master back then. Now that even the five birds sect has done the same, why can't Hongyue do the same?"
  Old demon Yuan was such a difficult person to deal with, and he already had no problems. Why couldn't you, Ying Hongyue?
 For a moment, all the pressure was transferred to Red Moon.
 Instead of trying to obtain the breathing technique of five birds, it was better to first think of a way to cultivate it. In this way, the breathing technique of five birds would be given out directly, killing two birds with one stone, and everyone would benefit.
 ,m "Thank you, King Yuan, for your righteousness. The five birds sect is indeed an example of the martial arts world!"  At this moment, all the martial masters became polite.
 What they paid was an inherited secret technique, while Ying Hongyue only needed to pay an obscure secret technique. Who didn't know which was more important?
 So what if he was powerful?
 If you don't give it to us, we martial masters aren't to be trifled with. You, Ying Hongyue, know this in your heart. You can control the central region, but can you suppress the world?
 If you don't give it to me, I'll kill all your men outside of the central continent and assassinate all your superpowers. Compared to assassination, even fairies are no match for martial masters. Fairies still have energy fluctuations. If a large group of martial masters go and assassinate you ... Even fairies can't stand aside!

 The press conference came to an end.
 However, there was a group of excited martial masters left at the scene. Many martial masters were ready to discuss whether they could join forces to force the enemy. Of course, it would be stupid and stupid to fight directly at the red moon.
 How?
 Kill!
 ,m In all the major provinces, starting to hunt down the people of the Crimson Moon until Ying Hongyue had no choice but to disclose the secret technique was the right way.  The group of martial masters had the same thought.
 Negotiations and whatnot were unreliable.
 The best way was to kill until the red moon couldn't bear it.
 ……
  On the second floor.
 In a private room, Hong Yitang exhaled and said softly,""Red Moon will be in a lot of trouble, unless we disclose the secret technique in advance."
 "If Ying Hongyue directly disclosed the secret technique, wouldn't the five birds sect be in trouble?" his wife asked from the side.
 At that time, should the five birds sect be passed on or not?
 "Why? Moreover, how could the Crimson Moon bow its head? as one of the three great organizations, it had easily lowered its head because of the pressure of a group of martial masters. Although Ying Hongyue knew that lowering its head might bring some trouble to Yuan Shuo, the invincible might of the Crimson Moon that he had built over the years was instantly destroyed! Everyone in Hong Yue will think that if they can disclose the secret technique today, will they give up their lives tomorrow?"
 "Under such circumstances, you can't bow your head easily even if you have to fight to the end. Otherwise, everyone will use the same method to force you again and again!"
 "Take the government for example. No matter how the three major organizations threaten or coerce them, once they are in real trouble, they will not compromise even if they have to destroy an entire city. Why are they so determined? It's to prevent the possibility of a second time!"
 As the head of swords gate, Hong Yitang understood the situation.
 If she was a pure Martial Master and Ying Hongyue was alone, there was really hope that she could force him to hand it over.
 But ... He was the master of a powerful force.
 How could he hand it over!
 Unless he really couldn't take it anymore, there would be hope. He would never lower his head until the red moon suffered heavy losses.
 His wife probably understood what he meant. She nodded slightly and transmitted a message,""Did you hear what Li Hao and the others said just now?"
 "I can vaguely hear some ..."
 Hong Yitang frowned slightly and quickly transmitted his voice,""Don't worry about it. Just remind them not to get involved. It's still hou Xiaochen's world. Even if they know about this, unless they want to have a falling out with hou Xiaochen, who would dare to take the risk?"  Of course, there would always be people who weren't afraid.
 Then these people deserved to die.
 As for Li Hao ... Hong Yitang thought for a while and felt that he might not be in trouble. Li Hao might not be simple.
 He looked kind and gentle, but he had been to the ancient city with Li Hao.
 So many people had died, and Li Hao and the others had come out alive ... Was it really that simple?
 How many supers died that day?
 However, Li Hao, Liu Long, and the others had all escaped unscathed. This alone was enough to prove that they were not simple.
 However, since they were all here, they didn't think that Li Hao was anything special.
 The more Hong Yitang thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong.
 A Martial Master who felt like nothing special had managed to survive in the dangerous environment of the ancient city. Although he didn't feel like he had gained anything, was this ... Really easy?
 His wife did not say anything else.
 Hong Yitang thought for a while and said,""We're living in Silver Moon, after all. Other people might be able to split up, but it's difficult for us! At this point, only the two three suns of swords gate are not under our control ... It's time to make a decision. Should we join hou Xiaochen, or should we get closer to the three great organizations, or should we move to another province and see if there's a way out?"
 This time, he came to the White moon City with such thoughts.
 He was also in a difficult position!
  However, he had no choice but to make a decision. Be it the three major organizations or the night watchmen, they were like fire and water now. Swords gate had been living in a narrow gap, but now, this gap was gone. He had to make a decision quickly.
 "Yitang, do we really have to get involved? You built swords gate bit by bit, you put in so much blood, sweat, and tears ..."
 "No choice!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hong Yitang looked at Li Hao and the others who were leaving and said telepathically,""Even a disciple as strong as Yuan Shuo had to join the night patrolmen to seek protection. Yuan Shuo had left alone so that he would not be bound! How many martial masters in the martial arts world were not restricted? At least, I, Hong Yitang, can't do it ... At this time, we can either choose to side with the three major organizations or become the night patrollers!"
 However, he was also worried that he would be treated as cannon fodder if he joined the night patrol.
 Joining the three major organizations ... Would have a higher chance!
 At this time, he looked at Li Hao's back again. His eyes flickered, and he sent a message: "I'll wait for Yuan Shuo's return!"
 "What?"
 His wife didn't understand this time, but Hong Yitang laughed and transmitted his voice,"When Yuan Shuo returns to Silver Moon, I'll use Yuan Shuo as an excuse for the night patrolmen. If Yuan Shuo returns, if he's willing to join the night patrolmen ... Then swords gate will follow his lead!"
 "That guy is really flexible and sensitive. So many people have died, but he is still alive and well. He is now a Martial Master. As a Martial Master of the same generation, I may not be at a disadvantage if I follow him."

 His wife was still very confused and transmitted a message,""Is it okay to say that?"
 "It can be done! Don't worry, hou Xiaochen is definitely waiting for Yuan Shuo to return ... So, there won't be any problems!"
 Yuan Shuo would definitely return. That fellow had an unruly personality, but he was a little good. At least he would remember where his nest was and where his disciple was. He would return sooner or later.
 ……
 Naturally, Li Hao had no idea about swords gate's decision.
 He wasn't interested in knowing all this.
 At this moment, he started walking towards the night patrolman headquarters. The journey was not far, so he was not afraid of any danger.
 Even if there was danger, it would be something to do when they returned home at night.
 After dealing with this group, there was still another group.
 The night patrolman from the headquarters!
 This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan had already greeted her before.
 Sure enough, as soon as he reached the door, a young man with green hair blocked his way. He had a fake smile on his face and was accompanied by Hao lianchuan.
 "Li Hao!"
 Hao lianchuan also greeted him with a smile and waved.""Come on!"
 Li Hao quickly ran over.
 Hao lianchuan chuckled."Let me introduce you. This is the special Agent from the headquarters, Special Agent Yu. Don't be fooled by his young age. He is a powerhouse at the middle stage of the three yang realm!"
 Yu Xiao laughed and pretended to be reserved: "you're overpraising me. The middle stage of the three yang realm is not worth mentioning in the central region!"
 "My Lord!"
 Li Hao hurriedly saluted, his face full of adoration, envy, admiration, and desire. This made Yu Xiao's mood improve greatly.
 Yuan Shuo's disciple, the eight great families "successor ... So what?
 Up until now, he was only a Martial Master with a cultivation of over 100.
 An existence at the level of a Dark Moon!
 The gap between the two was like the distance between heaven and earth. There was still the third level of the radiant sun realm and the early stage of the three suns realm. The gap was too great, so great that he didn't need to be envious or jealous of Li Hao.
 "You're Li Hao, right?"
 Li Hao hurriedly nodded and said,""My Lord, I am Li Hao, from Silver City, from the five birds sect. I am also a Night Watcher, and I have only joined recently. Please take care of me, my Lord!"
 "Good, good!"
 Yu Xiao's face was full of smiles."I have some things that I want to understand from you. Is it convenient?"
 "It's convenient, Sir, please ask ..."Li Hao hurriedly said.
 "Then let's find a place to sit down and chat."
 He didn't really like this place. It made him feel depressed.
 Li Hao carefully glanced at Hao lianchuan. Hao lianchuan frowned slightly, but still said,""Alright, Li Hao, you and special Agent Yu go to the teahouse next door and have a seat. Remember, don't talk nonsense!"
 Li Hao hurriedly nodded.  Yu Xiao didn't care and said indifferently,""Then that's it. Li Hao, follow me."
 "Yes, my Lord!"
 Li Hao hurriedly followed. Yu Xiao strode away. If he hadn't been waiting for Li Hao, he wouldn't have stayed here.
 ……
 After a while.
 In a private room in the teahouse.
 Li Hao hurriedly filled Yu Xiao's Cup with tea. Yu Xiao laughed."You're quite skilled. Do you do this often?"
 Li Hao smiled honestly."In the past, we used to pour tea for our teacher. We martial masters are like this. We grow step by step. We need to do some things in order for our teacher to impart some knowledge."
 "Old tradition!"
 Yu Xiao was disdainful."That's why martial masters have declined. All Masters like to hide something. They have to hide everything. They're not like superpowers, who don't need to flatter anyone!"
 Li Hao was a little envious, but also a little helpless.""Unfortunately, I can't become a super. I tried ..."
 Yu Xiao was not surprised. He smiled and said,"that's normal. You've broken through 100 and your body is strong. It's hard to break the shackles and become a super." However, that's only because the shackles are strengthened by inner strength. If I find an opportunity, I can still succeed. "
 Li Hao was looking forward to it. He nodded, but didn't say anything.
 Yu Xiao laughed and motioned for him to sit down.
 Li Hao obediently sat down in a hurry.
 "You're the descendant of the Li family, right?"Yu Xiao asked directly.
 Li Hao nodded, then shook his head,"I don't know, but that's what everyone says. I actually don't know anything about the eight great families." But since Crimson Moon is here, I think that Crimson moon's years of research ... Might be right. "
 "Your Li family's sword ..."
 "I've handed it over to the organization!"
 "I wonder if it's with Minister Kuang or Minister hou," Li Hao quickly replied.
 Yu Xiao nodded thoughtfully.
  "You said at the press conference that the breathing technique of five birds combined with the Scion of the blood God could make a Martial Master stronger quickly, right?"
 Li Hao nodded again.
 "I really can't hand over the breathing technique of five birds to the night watchman. You'll get a lot of benefits by then."
 Li Hao was at a loss. He said helplessly,"this ... I can't do it without my teacher's permission. Otherwise, my teacher will get rid of me. You may not know this, but it's a great taboo in the martial world. Although the martial world no longer exists, my teacher ... Still exists!"
 Seeing Li Hao's pitiful appearance, Yu Xiao laughed. "It's fine. I'm just asking. I'm not forcing you to hand over your secret technique. "Of course, if you have such thoughts ... Silvermoon Nightwalker might not be able to bear the consequences. Don't forget that the headquarters are in stellarsky city. That ... Isn't a place where a Martial Master can act so atrociously!"
 He laughed.
 Li Hao was embarrassed and didn't dare to speak.
 When Yu Xiao took another sip of tea, Li Hao hurriedly stood up and filled his cup.
 Yu Xiao leaned back in his chair, chuckling as he watched.
 "Li Hao," he said after a while,"your bloodline might be special. We need some of your blood to study. Do you have any objections?"

 "No, I didn 't!"
 "No!" Li Hao hurriedly shook his head and said honestly,"if the headquarters wants to study it, it's a must! My Lord, I'm bleeding now?"
 “……”
 So obedient!
 Yu Xiao thought that this person would at least struggle and resist a little, but now it seemed like he really treated the night patrol as a life-saving straw.
 Everyone said that Yuan Shuo was treacherous, but this disciple of his ... Was really simple and honest.
 "Blood ... Li Hao, the headquarters won't mistreat you. However, what I need isn't ordinary blood, but blood essence ..." Yu Xiao said with a smile.
 This time, Li Hao was in a difficult position. He struggled."My Lord ... Blood essence ... One drop of blood essence will greatly damage my vitality. Previously, in the ancient ruins, I ... I was injured quite badly ..."
 "You don't want to?" Yu Xiao frowned.
 "No, no!"
  Li Hao hurriedly shook his head."Why wouldn't I? it's not like I can't replenish my blood essence. I ... Alright, I'll provide you with a drop of blood essence." But ... My Lord, can you wait for a day or two?"
 "Why?" Yu Xiao smiled.
 Li Hao scratched his head."That ... The Marquis rewarded me with some treasures. After I ate them, I could gather some blood essence. In this case, my losses wouldn't be too great."
 "Blood God?"
 "Yes, yes!"
 Li Hao nodded his head, very honest.
 Yu Xiao didn't mind, but he still subconsciously said,""He's really good to you ..."
 Li Hao smiled."It's alright. The main reason is that I made a contribution this time. In the remains ..."
 Li Hao suddenly shut up.
 He raised his head and glanced at Yu Xiao. He seemed to have said something he shouldn't have. He was a little timid and quickly lowered his head."Right, the Marquis tribe values him!"
 “……”
 Only then did Yu Xiao recall that this person in front of him had been to the ruins!
 Previously, he had only thought that hou Xiaochen valued Li Hao and wanted to get Yuan Shuo on his side.
 But at this moment ... Could there be more inside information?
 In fact, they had asked some people about the remains, but Li Hao said that he had made a contribution. What contribution?
 Yu Xiao's interest was piqued.
 Everyone was still very interested in these remains.
 He realized that there might be some problems with this, and he asked casually,""Li Hao, are there really a lot of treasures in the remains?"
 Li Hao nodded hurriedly."Many, many. There are divine energy stones everywhere ..."
 "You saw it from inside?"
 "Yes."
  Seeing that he didn't seem to want to say more, Yu Xiao laughed and said,""By the way, Li Hao, will you enter the relic next month?"  "I do ..."
 As Li Hao said this, he hurriedly shut up and shook his head.""No, I won 'T. I'm so weak ..."
 Yu Xiao immediately realized the problem.
 Li Hao still wanted to go in?
 It was said that these ancient ruins were related to the eight great families, could it be ... Could it be that there was something he didn't know?
 However, as far as he knew, it was nothing. Li Hao had even used his blood essence to open the city gate in the remains, but he had failed.
 Then what was the situation with his so-called Meritorious Service?
 Yu Xiao's heart itched, and he felt somewhat uncomfortable. Seeing that Li Hao wasn't very brave, he immediately became dignified and coughed."Li Hao, you should know that I'm from the headquarters. Our goal is to make sure that the three major organizations can't get any benefits!"
 "As a Night Watcher, it's very dangerous to hide important information from your superiors. It's also very fatal. If it's serious, there's even the risk of being labeled as a rebellion ..."
 Li Hao's face paled, but he didn't dare to look up. He said gloomily,""No... I really didn't ..."
 "Li Hao!"
 Li Hao quickly raised his head, his face pale."Your Excellency, I didn't ... Didn 't!"
 "You're still being stubborn?"
 "What?" Yu Xiao frowned and said with a cold face,"do you think the higher-ups don't have any information?"
 Li Hao's face instantly turned pale. After a long while, he said with difficulty,""I ... I'm not hiding anything. I've already reported it to the Minister and the others ..."
 "Then let me ask you, is Silver Moon still under the jurisdiction of the dynasty? Since you're here, as your superior, are you still going to hide it from me?"
 "But Minister hou told me not to leak it. I'm afraid ..." Li Hao said in a low voice, extremely dejected.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Don't be afraid. Don't worry, I'll keep your secret. Don't you trust your superior?"
 Li Hao struggled. After a while, he nodded and said in a low voice,""Actually ... Actually it's nothing much, just two small things. "First, I didn't enter the city at that time. I was waiting outside for the Lords to come out. I just happened to ... Just happened to see a weapon that looked like a little snake flying out. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. The little snake weapon flew to a place. At that time, something happened in the city. I didn't dare to say it. Later, I told Minister hou, but the Minister told me not to tell anyone."
 An origin divine weapon!
  Shadow snake sword!
 Hearing this, Yu Xiao's eyes lit up. He immediately realized something.
 "You ... You saw that sword fly out?"
 "It's not a sword. It looks like a snake. "
 You idiot, what do you know? it's the sword.
 He knew that Li Hao had probably never seen an origin divine weapon before. If he had, it would probably be the Phoenix spear. After all, hou Xiaochen had used it before.
 His mind instantly became active as he hurriedly said,""Where did you leave it?"
 "On the roof of an ancient house. Because I can't fly, I didn't dare to look. I thought it was an ancient beast from the city, so ... I didn't dare to meddle in other people's business."
 An origin divine weapon!
 This was truly a pleasant surprise. Yu Xiao's expression was somewhat excited. He couldn't obtain the origin divine weapon. Zhang Ting was able to obtain it because she had a heavy responsibility on her shoulders. Otherwise, how could a mid three yang realm expert have the qualifications to carry an origin divine weapon?

 If he could obtain it ...
 It seemed that Zhang Ting was really dead!
 No wonder the other party wanted Li Hao to go in again. Anyone who knew the whereabouts of an origin god weapon would pay attention to it.
 "Can you tell me the exact location of the ancient house?"
 Li Hao was a little conflicted."It's very difficult. But if I enter again, I'll probably ... Probably find it. Or I can go back and draw a map for you. It might not be accurate, but it should be about the same."
 "You drew a picture for hou Xiaochen?"
 "Not yet. Hou bu hasn't come out of seclusion. Last time, he only said a few words, but he told me not to tell anyone. I was originally going to tell hou bu, but he hasn't appeared yet, so I don't dare to tell anyone."
 In other words, even hou Xiaochen didn't know the exact address!
 Yu Xiao's eyes lit up. If that was the case ... Perhaps ...
 Of course, hou Xiaochen would still come out of seclusion. Once he did, he would ask Li Hao. The coward would not dare to hide anything.
  However, it was fine. At that time, he also knew that he might be able to retrieve the shadow snake sword in advance.
 Hou Xiaochen himself might not enter the ruins.
 "Alright," he said sternly."When you return, give me a draft ... Remember, you're not allowed to spread it!"
 "Definitely!"
 Li Hao nodded.
 Yu Xiao thought, what if Li Hao died before hou Xiaochen came out?
 Then, no one would know where the shadow snake sword was.
 Of course, that would have to wait until Li Hao gave him the item.
 "You said two things, and this is one of them. What about the other?"
 Li Hao hesitated again, but he still said honestly,""The second thing is related to my blood."
 "What?"
 Yu Xiao was puzzled. How was it related?
 Is your blood special?
 Could there really be a problem with the blood of the eight great families?
 "It's like this ..."
 Li Hao thought for a moment and said in a low voice,"Minister hou ... He's really injured, and it's an old injury. His internal organs are severely damaged!" However, I can cure his injury. Once he's cured, Minister hou's strength will be 30% stronger. "
 Yu Xiao almost laughed. How was that possible?
 You can cure it?
 Who are you trying to fool!
 "It's true!"
 Li Hao explained,"actually, my blood has always had this effect. It's just that I didn't pay much attention to it at first. That day, department head hou killed that red-haired man and was injured. I couldn't bear to see him like this, so I gave him a drop of my blood ... After he took it, the department head said that my blood is a treasure ... So he asked me to come to white moon City immediately. He has been in seclusion these few days, probably to prepare for this."
 "What a joke ... How is that possible ..."
 Li Hao seemed to be unwilling. Seeing that he didn't believe him, he gritted his teeth and said boldly,""My Lord, it's fine if you don't believe me. If you can trust me ... You can make a small wound on yourself now ... I'll take a drop of blood and you'll know when you taste it."
 Yu Xiao slightly frowned. At this moment, his emotions were fluctuating.
 Could it be ... True?
 That's impossible!
 "I see." He frowned and nodded after a while."Let's try it then!"
 As he said that, a crack appeared on his finger and blood started to seep through.
 Li Hao didn't waste any words. He gritted his teeth and made a cut on his arm. Soon, a drop of blood oozed out.  Li Hao took out the blood. At this moment, many sword energy flowed into it.
 Li Hao hurriedly wrapped the blood with his inner strength and handed it over to him.
 Yu Xiao looked at this drop of blood and frowned slightly. He was somewhat disdainful.
 But ... What if it was true?
 He endured his disgust and swallowed the drop of blood.
 In an instant ... Yu Xiao's heart was violently shaken.
 ܳ!
 What was going on?
 At this moment, he felt something different. It was more than just different. The wound on his hand had instantly recovered.
 Not only that, he even felt that this drop of blood was strengthening his body.
 Some of his injuries had actually recovered in the blink of an eye.
 It was unbelievable!
 This ... This ... How is this possible?
 He looked at Li Hao, his eyes full of shock.
 This was impossible!
 If this was true, Li Hao would be a human-shaped precious medicine.
 Not only that ... This idiot ... This idiot actually went around saying, Oh my God!
 He was shocked by Li Hao's idiotic behavior.
 Even if this was true, he couldn't tell everyone.
 This was simply courting death.
 At this moment, he seriously suspected that hou Xiaochen wanted to eat this guy or raise him like a human medicine.
 Was hou Xiaochen injured?
 Perhaps ... There was.
 Regardless of whether it was true or not, who could resist the temptation when he sensed the uniqueness of Li Hao's blood?
 At this moment, Yu Xiao only had one thought in his mind ... He wanted to kill Li Hao on the spot and turn him into a great medicine ... No, no!
 Hou Xiaochen knew!
 Moreover, they all knew that he had taken Li Hao away, so they couldn't do that. If that happened, hou Xiaochen would go crazy and kill him. If he couldn't kill him, everything would be exposed, and he wouldn't be his anymore!
 Great medicine!
 This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This was even more precious than some of the legendary treasures.
 One drop of blood made him feel that his own people had become younger.
 Then ... What about the blood in his body?
 Would he ... Be able to step into the rising light realm or even higher?
 At this moment, even Yu Xiao was somewhat crazy.
 ,m At the same time, he was shocked by Li Hao's stupidity. Did he not think that someone would want to kill him?  Oh my God, do you know the red moon?
 Could it be that they were also doing this for this?
 Could it be that the blood of the eight great families all had this effect?
 No wonder Hong Yue had been hunting the people of the eight great families ... If this was the case, it seemed to explain why Ying Hong Yue was so powerful.

 Ying Hongyue ... The next Ying Hongyue?
 Whoever got Li Hao would become the next Ying Hongyue.
 In this instant, Yu Xiao was thinking too much.
 He wanted to kill, to silence ... No, he wanted to kill and take blood, or even flesh!
 Flesh and blood were all precious treasures!
 I can't let hou Xiaochen get away with this.
 If hou Xiaochen was really injured and recovered after drinking Li Hao's blood, that would be terrifying.
 Even if he wasn't injured, Li Hao's blood was still a precious treasure.
 A drop of blood was even comparable to a divine power Stone. It was just an ordinary drop of blood. At this moment, he even felt a little heartache. He was distressed that Li Hao seemed to have taken out a few drops of heart blood earlier, but it was said that no one had paid attention to it at the time.
 Damn it, what a waste!
  He wanted to take his blood, but after thinking about it, Hu Qingfeng asked him to take his blood for research. If he found something, he would be in trouble.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Isn't the blood from your heart more effective?"he asked sternly.
 Li Hao nodded."That's for sure. Moreover, it's effective when you hold it in your hand."
 "Then ... Wait a few days to gather the blood from your heart. There's no rush!"
 That was all the more reason not to bring it back. Li Hao was an idiot. If they asked him for it and took the blood from his heart, Li Hao would definitely be suspicious and would be easily discovered.
 Yu Xiao took a deep breath and said in a deep voice,""This matter is of great importance. Don't tell anyone else, it will endanger your safety! Li Hao, how can you tell others so casually?"
 "No," Li Hao said honestly."I only told hou bu. Hou bu was injured, but he still helped me. I couldn't bear to see him vomit blood. As for Milord ..."
 Li Hao smiled honestly."You're a genius from the headquarters. It's said that there are countless geniuses in the central continent. There are probably many people like me in the central continent too. Besides, I can't lie to you when you ask me!" We're all night patrollers, and night patrollers represent justice ... So I'm not afraid!"
 Idiot!
 Yu Xiao cursed in his heart. 'If we were in the wilderness, I'd kill you in an instant!'
 He had no intention of telling Hu Qingfeng about this.
 In fact, Li Hao was sure that he wouldn't tell him.
 How could he say that?
 If he told Li Hao ... Li Hao would call him Grandpa!
 Of course, it would be fine even if he said it.
 If Hu Qingfeng really had such an intention, he would definitely come and give it a try. Li Hao didn't mind giving him a drop of normal blood to have a taste ... Yu Xiao would probably be crippled by the headquarters 'Xu Guang for spreading false information.
 At this moment, Li Hao knew that this guy was tempted.
 If it was him, he would also be tempted.
  Origin god weapon, precious blood ... If you can endure this, then you must be a Saint. I misunderstood you. If you don't kill me, I won't find trouble with you. You're a role model for supers!  Since he was tempted, there was nothing else to do once Minister hou came out of seclusion.
 At this moment, whether Li Hao should or could not be killed, he should be killed!
 Minister hou coming out of seclusion was Yu Xiao's greatest pressure.
 "Do you know when Minister hou will come out of seclusion?" Yu Xiao suddenly asked.
 Li Hao shook his head, but then said,"probably soon. Secretary Yu said three days at most!" Because there are still many things to take care of, it is impossible for the Marquis to not come out of seclusion. "
 At this point, Li Hao chuckled and said,"if hou bu comes out of seclusion, I'll be able to treat his injuries. We night patrollers will be even stronger!" In addition, the Lords are also here, so we might be able to wipe out the three great organizations in one fell swoop!"
 How naive!
 Yu Xiao cursed in his heart and felt a sense of urgency.
 Three days!
 Three days at most ... Time was tight, and he might not even need three days before the other party came out.
 "Alright, why don't you go back today and draw the blueprint? bring it along with you. I'll look for you whenever I have the time, and you can just hand it over to me ... Right, don't tell anyone about what I told you today!"
 "No!" Li Hao nodded.
 Yu Xiao thought for a moment and suddenly took out an item. It was a divine power Stone. Yu Xiao's heart ached a little, but he still handed it to Li Hao."This is for you. You should know a little about the divine power Stone. It's your reward!"
 Li Hao was overjoyed. His face was full of excitement and disbelief.
 "My Lord ... Are you really giving it to me?" he asked carefully.
 "Of course!"
 "Many thanks, my Lord!"
  Overjoyed, Li Hao said enviously,""My Lord, you ... This thing ... How did you take it out? I saw Hao bu taking things out like this ..."
 "It's just a storage ring!"
 At this moment, Yu Xiao also laughed and said indifferently,"There are storage rings in some ancient ruins, and the central continent is also developing them. There's a batch of them now, and some space supers are making them! It's quite expensive, but it's nothing to us ..."
 Li Hao's eyes turned red with envy. Yu Xiao laughed and said,"Do your best. If you make another contribution next time, I might even give you one!"
 "Thank you for your kind words, my Lord!" Li Hao was flattered.
 "A small matter!"
 p At this moment, Yu Xiao was also laughing heartily. He drank a cup of tea and suppressed the excitement in his heart. He then said, Are you living with Hao lianchuan now?"  "Yes, I live opposite."
 "Oh?" Yu Xiao nodded and said,"are we going to and from work together?"
 Li Hao shook his head."We'll go to work together today. I'll leave by myself after work. Department head Hao has to work overtime. He's the department head and is busy." Besides, it's not far, I can just walk back by myself and learn more about the White moon City. I'm new here, so I don't know anything. "
