This result was in line with Li Hao's expectations.However, the reincarnation Emperor didn't leave!Samsara's eyes turned cold,"are you looking down on me?" Why did he leave? The East, the place where I've reincarnated for countless years. I shouldn't be the one to go!"He looked at Li Hao.Perhaps this was his last chance. If he couldn't kill Li Hao this time, would he be able to kill him again and again?He was not an idiot.He didn't have to die.Instead, he knew very well that he failed to kill Li Hao despite gathering his strength time and time again. Next time?There won't be a next time!In the beginning, Li Hao's side barely killed di yang, then killed Sun Moon, lie tu, and Fu Sheng, and today, he killed Feng Ming and the others. It had only been a few months.The chaos was too vast, and each trip would take a long time.Next time?The next time he met Li Hao, he would probably die.His death was worthless!When the heavenly Daoist sect was established, Li Hao had paid a huge price for it. The next time they met, he might be killed instantly.This was not the result he wanted!"Li Hao ... Do you dare to?""I'm the most powerful man in the East!"Reincarnation Emperor shouted in a low voice. Only by killing me can you truly leave your name in the primordial chaos, undying for all eternity! Only by killing me will you be able to intimidate everyone and establish your myriad DAOs Foundation!""Of course ... If I kill you, I will kill the king of men and rule the East again!"All in one throw!What was there to consider now?Pengcheng and the others panicked when they heard that. 'Why don't you come at me together instead of fighting me one-on-one?'They were at least stronger than those three guys!There were even more grade-7 ones.Since they weren't leaving, it was better to join forces.They felt that Samsara might really have gone crazy.A few grade 8 ones were killed in the middle realm, was this guy crazy?Otherwise, they would definitely be stronger if they joined forces!However, the reincarnation Emperor didn't even look at them.Join hands?Was it really better to work together and have scruples than to fight one-on-one?Pengcheng's side had three people, all from the huntian faction. Once they were at a disadvantage, it was very likely that they would flee. The Earth Spirit monarch was obviously in the same situation. In that case, he might as well fight Li Hao alone!As for these people, they would just hold the line!It wasn't that he looked down on these fellows, but they were all very strong, but ... So what?On the human King side, there were still more than ten grade-8 experts. What could they do?Perhaps only by staking everything on one throw and fighting with his back to the water could he stimulate all his potential and fight to the death!This might give him a better chance!This was Samsara's thoughts. On Li Hao's side, Thunderlord and the others had strange looks in their eyes. At this moment, Wu Shan said in a deep voice,""Don't agree ... They must be plotting something ..."He said.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Let Li Hao go through the gate of life and death?Trap Li Hao and then kill them?It was very likely that this was the case!The three of them were no match for those guys. There was no doubt about that.In any case, they felt that it was a trap.Now, if they joined forces and fought a chaotic battle, the human King might be able to completely change the situation if he could kill Extreme Ice.At this moment, Li Hao looked at Samsara and smiled."One-on-one?"He suddenly laughed!This time, his smile was rather sincere."In a life-and-death battle between martial masters like me, Silver Moon, it's always like this! I don't like chaotic battles, even if chaotic battles only create more opportunities for me!"Li Hao's smile was very wide."I enjoy it very much. Sparring between martial masters can determine who is better, and also life and death!" This way, I feel that I'm still a Martial Master, a swordsman, and the martial world is still there!"Li Hao stepped forward and looked at Samsara. The gate of life and death appeared in front of Samsara. He looked at Li Hao and said,""You agree?""Not at the moment."Li Hao said softly,"you stay. You chose to fight to the death with me. Although we are enemies, I can still trust you." But I don't trust the people around you!"Samsara laughed,"what do I have to do for you to believe me?." "How can I believe that?"Li Hao murmured softly. The next moment, his laughter rang in everyone's ears. "I'll believe it if one more dies!"The few of them were shocked!What?The reincarnation Emperor's eyes flickered, but he didn't speak or move. He just stood in the void without moving.And at this moment, the sword went to the West!It flew straight towards Peng Cheng, who turned pale with fright and fled in an instant. He turned into a kun Peng and flew through the void.Samsara actually didn't stop him!Emperor Earth Spirit's expression changed as well. He didn't know if he should stop the attack, or escape ...The moment he had this thought, Li Hao laughed."I can't take the wrath of a rank 9. Daoist Pengcheng, you're overthinking it! Plus, you're all under senior huntian, how would I dare to kill you?"As soon as he finished speaking, the long sword floated in the air, and the power of the five elements emerged. It was extremely powerful.At this moment, it was as if the God of the five elements had appeared.The five-element Dao domain instantly expanded and enveloped the surroundings, charging straight at the Earth Spirit. Li Hao's voice faintly rang out,""The five elements from the North also dare to participate in this battle? The five elements Supreme Emperor is strong when combined, but is he strong when separated?"The sword was like a god!The five elements emerged. There were apes, Tigers, birds of prey ...Tiger out of the cage!There was no turning back when the sword was drawn. The five elements domain collapsed instantly. In the long river, Yuan Shuo coughed up blood and fell out of the world. He looked at Li Hao in shock.What was this little lunatic doing now?Bang! Bang!The five elements exploded. Li Hao's sword broke through the earth Spirit Emperor's defense. The earth element was the best at defense, but it was broken in an instant. The Nirvana sword fell in the blink of an eye, and Kong Ji fell from the world.

Chapter 3521 Battle Of Dao, Dao Perishing, Samsara Dies!
After forcing out two tier 7 experts and emptying out the energy of their realm, the sword fell!Crack!The Dao domain shattered and the mountain peak was destroyed.The sword returned, the Tiger roared, the chaos trembled, BOOM!A bloody gash appeared on the Earth Spirit monarch's forehead after a loud bang.At this moment, he was looking at Li Hao in a daze.The power of his great Dao spread wildly.At this moment, figures began to appear in the northern region, and the energies of fire, metal, wood, and water began to roil.The power of Li Hao's great Dao spread, and his sword intent soared through the world."Kill me, I will definitely kill you! If you don't come to the five elements world, I will go there sooner or later. I will kill you all, take the five elements, and fulfill my master's wish! Five elements of chaos, five birds reign supreme!"Arrogant, domineering, and Savage!Li Hao sneered. He looked down on the heavens and was not afraid of the five elements.Do you dare to come?He didn't dare, and he still dared to interfere in the matters of the East?The void trembled and the great Dao spread. After a while, the void trembled. In the distance, a venerable sovereign suddenly appeared. At this moment, his face was cold and he revealed an aura that did not match his strength. His voice was cold."Then I'll wait for you! Silver Moon Li Hao, I am a gold spirit! And today, the reason you're not dead is not because of you ..."Li Hao laughed scornfully,'if you don't have the heart to rival a rank 9, how can you prove the path to rank 9? Afraid of tianfang, afraid of the Lord of the lightning tribulation, they didn't dare to move. Level 8 ... They had cultivated for nothing! If you don't come, I'll go sooner or later. Wait for me!"In the distance, the unique aura on the venerable sovereign's body dissipated. The venerable sovereign instantly came back to his senses. His face was pale, and he didn't dare to say anything more. He immediately fled into the void.Just now, the Overlord of the North had come from afar.He didn't have much combat strength, he was just furious and came here to say a few harsh words.At this moment, Li Hao shook his head."Huntian is the strongest, followed by Chunqiu, and then long Zhan ... After all, there are five of them. Even Jin Ling isn't as strong as long Zhan, or even you. I can only say that he's luckier. One mother has five children, and heaven and earth favor him ..."The reincarnation monarch seemed to have just seen him kill the Earth Spirit with one strike. He suddenly smiled and said,""Luck is also strength! Speaking of luck, you're not bad, and I'm not bad either. Who doesn't have some luck to get to where they are today? "However, you are right. The Five Emperors of the North are indeed not as good as long Zhan. If the four sides compete for hegemony, the North will definitely be defeated. The first to be defeated will be the North ..."At this moment, he seemed to have ignored the fact that the Earth Spirit had been killed. He looked at Li Hao, and his eyes flickered."No wonder you're so powerful and improved in an instant. However ... You chased away two level Seven venerable sovereigns and exhausted two advanced worlds. Do you think that you're far superior to me when we fought previously?""No!"Li Hao laughed,'a spar between martial masters is about fairness! I killed the Earth Spirit with the power of two level Seven Worlds and eliminated the unfairness. I'm fair to you and me!"He was even weaker than before.After killing the Earth Spirit, the power of his teacher and Kong Ji was completely drained by him. He lost two worlds 'power in an instant. If he had close to 6000 Dao powers before, he now had around 5000 Dao powers, which was equivalent to reincarnation. This was the fairness in Li Hao's eyes.He looked at the escaping kun Peng and laughed,"Daoist Pengcheng, why are you running so fast? "I said, senior huntian is a ninth-rank Overlord, so how could I dare to kill his people? I'm not afraid of the five elements, but that doesn't mean I'm not afraid of huntian! Come back and stay here. I'll spar with fellow Daoist reincarnation. If he dies, you have to collect his corpse ... Leave the reincarnation realm behind. You ... Can't escape with it!"In the distance, Pengcheng's expression changed.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  At this moment, he looked at Samsara from afar and did not know what to feel.Samsara didn't stop Li Hao from killing the Earth Spirit. It was clear that at that moment, the two sides had come to a tacit understanding. He would kill the Earth Spirit to maintain the balance. Of course, Li Hao had also destroyed two tier 7 worlds, causing his combat power to drop.This was the balance in their eyes.In their eyes, the life of a rank eight venerable sovereign ... Seemed to be nothing more than this.The reincarnation Emperor also said,""Daoist Pengcheng, if I die, I will leave behind the reincarnation realm and take away the living beings of my reincarnation realm to join the huntian realm ... After all, there are still many Level Seven experts who can be of some use!"He smiled."If I win ... Li Hao, don't blow yourself up. Why don't you leave some traces for me to see?""Dao marks?""Not bad!""Daoist reincarnation, that's a good idea ... And you're ambitious. It seems like you want to spy on time ..."Samsara nodded,"who wouldn't covet the chaos experts?." At this moment, the two of them were like good friends, chatting freely.In the distance, the sounds of battle shook the heavens!The human King was much more direct. He would kill as he said and wouldn't say much to the other party. When he was free, he would curse a few words. When he wasn't free, he wouldn't say a word. He was a professional killer.On the other hand, Li Hao was much more refined.Of course, many venerable sovereigns had died.At this moment, the two sides were in a battle of words, one on one.Li Hao looked at the gates of life and death in front of him and said with a smile,""I've gone through life and death once. If I come out alive, you'll still be alive ... You'll go through my myriad DAOs River. Is that fair?""Very fair!"Samsara nodded.At this moment, Thunderlord and the others were extremely nervous. Li Hao turned around and looked at the crowd. "I've entered his path and watched life and death while you guys watch over Pengcheng and the others. I can't trust them, and they're not worth it! "Three against three, there are only a few fewer tier 7 opponents. Although they are slightly stronger, they can still fight for a while and not be instantly defeated ... These are the opponents I have left for you!"Li Hao chuckled and stepped forward.

Chapter 3522 Dao War, Dao Perishing, Death Of Samsara!
He liked this kind of duel.Martial masters had always been like this.A group fight didn't show the style of a Martial Master.Of course, it wasn't to the extent of only one person. There were many people in the river, but their strength was inferior. At least for now, it was fair."Li Hao, which gate are you going to use?""Gate of death!"Li Hao looked at the gates of life and death, then at the gates of death. He smiled and said,""I want to see what the death in your eyes is.""Please!"The gate of life disappeared and the gate of death appeared. It was as if there were countless ghosts inside and a cold wind emerged.Behind him, Thunderlord and the others were still extremely uneasy.This ... Li Hao was sometimes unexpected. At this moment, he was actually going to enter the other party's path. Li Hao also cultivated the Dao of life and death, but the Dao of life and death that Li Hao cultivated was different from the other party 'S. He simply walked the path of life and death and had many lives.The other party had proven his Dao through life and death, and was known as reincarnation.They wanted to say something but stopped ... But at this moment, they didn't know what to say. They could only say that Samsara was a capable person. He seemed to have seen through Li Hao's thoughts and even allowed Li Hao to kill the Earth Spirit just for this moment.Otherwise, Li Hao might not have agreed.Perhaps, this was also Li Hao's weakness?The few of them were not sure, so they did not say much. They looked at Yuan Shuo, who had fallen out of the hole. Yuan Shuo was calm and composed. When he saw them looking at him, he suddenly laughed,""He'll do his own thing!" It was normal.The Silver Moon Martial Master had always been like this. If his opponent was willing to fight him one-on-one, and their strength was equal, everyone would be very happy. Why would he refuse?  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  He even took the initiative to say,"no one is to disturb a life-and-death sparring!" If Li Hao were to die Here ... It would be fate! No one is allowed to interfere ... This is ... The rule!"The grade 8 experts were speechless.Bullsh * t rules!In the primordial chaos, were there any rules to speak of?Li Hao also smiled and nodded,"teacher is right. These are the rules!" It also applies to you ..."He looked at Samsara."How dare Pengcheng and the others interfere ... Dao friend Samsara, don't blame me for breaking the rules and killing them. I'm afraid our sparring will have to be interrupted!""Naturally!"Samsara seemed to know this very well and laughed."At this point, this might be my only chance to kill you. If I still don't understand, I've lived a million years in vain!""Then ... Let's start!" Li Hao smiled and entered the gate of death.In an instant, the gate of death disappeared. The reincarnation Emperor sat cross-legged in the void. At this moment, his spirit seemed to have completely disappeared as he was immersed in his own great Dao.The three emperors Peng and Cheng looked solemn.They were stronger than the three opponents, but as Li Hao had said, it was useless to be a little stronger. They couldn't kill them instantly. Even if they fought one-on-one, they would be entangled for a while. In that case, they might as well wait for the result.If Samsara won ... Li Hao would die, and these people wouldn't be a problem.At this moment, there was a strange silence.The venerable sovereigns who were observing in secret were all carefully investigating, not knowing what was going on with these people.Seeing that the fight seemed to be over ... He could only turn his gaze to the neo martial battlefield in the distance. At this moment, the battle was going on vigorously. Under the leadership of the human King, these people were really brutal. Every punch hit flesh, and every blade saw blood!At this moment, two level eight venerable sovereigns had already fallen. They were both venerable sovereigns of the extreme Ice world. Other than venerable Emperor Extreme Ice, the only one left of the three emperors of Extreme Ice was the boss.At this moment, the human King's qi and blood also rushed to the sky. The Supremes and the others frantically tried to stop the other venerable sovereigns from participating. Even the light venerable sovereign was affected by this. The divine light fist shattered the sky and earth, and shouts of killing filled the sky.The real excitement was over there, at least for the venerable sovereigns who were watching the battle.Secondly, the four-sided region was also very interesting. At this moment, the power of countless Thunder tribulations swarmed over and swept in all directions. As long Zhan returned, he used his body of Phoenix Flame to guide the Thunder tribulations. Countless Thunder tribulations covered the area. Long Zhan broke through the layers of Thunder tribulations in a frenzy. The entire four-sided region was also filled with a terrifying power.……Then, they looked at Li Hao.The moment he entered the gate of death, countless spirits appeared in front of him. This place was like a world of the dead.An extremely dense aura of death instantly rushed toward Li Hao.At this moment, the figure of the reincarnation Emperor appeared in the sky. He was like the king of the undead. Behind him, countless undead were prostrating."Li Hao!""This is death's door!" Reincarnation monarch's voice was heard. I admire your entrance ... This is my world, and I make the rules!"The rules!Li Hao raised his head and said,"you set the rules?" You're not good enough ... You're only a half-crippled world of rules. Do you really think I, Li Hao, am ignorant?"He looked at the cycle of reincarnation. In the next moment, he looked at the end of the world and saw something that looked like a heart. He smiled."Break this and your Dao will end! Samsara, I'm going to break it!"He stepped into the air and the great Dao appeared, shaking the world.However, at this moment, countless undead spirits emerged. They were not afraid of death, and they rushed over instantly. Even if they were killed instantly, they recovered in the blink of an eye. The heart in the distance was like a river, and the dead spirits recovered from it in the blink of an eye. They walked out instantly, boundless, as if they could never be killed.In the void, the reincarnation Emperor stood in the center of the heaven and earth. He didn't move, but countless undead spirits kept appearing. They couldn't be killed!This was death, but it was also a new life.

Chapter 3523 Dao War, Dao Perishing, Death Of Samsara!
Kill one and revive one. Kill one and revive one ...One undead spirit wasn't strong, but countless undead spirits would charge at him and resurrect him. Even a level eight venerable sovereign would be exhausted to death."Suppress!"Li Hao's divine words appeared and suppressed them. He stopped killing them. Countless undead were instantly suppressed, but in the next second, they exploded. In the blink of an eye, they were resurrected in the center of the heart in the distance and charged at him again.This cycle was endless!This was the life and death of reincarnation.At this moment, many of the people he had killed appeared around Li Hao. For example, Feng Ming, the three Samsara emperors, di yang, and Ying Hongyue!These people were all killed by Li Hao.And they seemed to have been resurrected here."Li Hao!""Li Hao!"​ "Give me back my life!""Kill him!"“……”At this moment, all the undead spirits seemed to come to life. The reincarnation Emperor appeared in the sky and laughed. He said softly,"The more people you kill, the more experts you kill, the more danger you will be in here!"How many level eight venerable sovereigns had Li Hao killed?The three emperors of Samsara were all killed by him. Even though they were actually killed by the Thunder Emperor and the others, everyone's hatred was on him. There were also the sun and moon emperors, Thearch earth yang, Thearch lie tu, Thearch Feng Ming, and Thearch Earth Spirit ...There were also fire phoenixes, white tigers, and mammoths, all seventh level venerable sovereigns.At this moment, it was as if they had all been resurrected.Li Hao didn't say much. He just looked into the distance and chuckled when he saw the beating heart."Unlimited revivals...But every time you resurrect, it will consume your energy, right? It's not like they really can't be killed!""Not bad. The cycle of life and death still has some restrictions, but ... I'm already very satisfied."The reincarnation Emperor didn't deny it. He laughed too."If you choose the gate of life, it might be simpler. Life and death reincarnate. It's more dangerous after death. Those who are alive might only show some of the living people you have a deep impression of ..."However, this place was filled with dead people.At this moment, the Samsara Emperor said,"right now, we're only your enemies. Soon ... Perhaps your family, friends, and all the people who have died will be resurrected here. Li Hao ... What do you think of my world of the dead?""That's right, but ... I don't like it!"The river of the great path emerged. Although the level Seven and level eight venerable sovereigns were not as powerful as when they were alive, they were still as strong as before. They all charged at Li Hao with hatred.Li Hao killed one of them with a single strike. In the blink of an eye, the other party resurrected in the distance.This was the cycle of life and death, and it was extremely terrifying.However, under normal circumstances, Li Hao would not be in such danger if he did not enter the gate of life and death. If the reincarnation Emperor could easily use it, he would have done so long ago. The Dao world was still immature. Thus, even if he allowed Li Hao to kill the Earth Spirit, he would still let Li Hao enter this place and fight him.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  In this place, he had the absolute advantage.He had also consumed a lot of energy, but now, a large number of experts were besieging Li Hao. All he needed to do was to continuously resurrect those people and consume his energy. As for Li Hao, he was instantly left with wounds.The energy of the various realms in the river was also starting to run out.The long river was also starting to dry up.Countless auras of death surged into it. Li Hao's life and death realm grew rapidly, but it was useless. No matter how much Lin Hongyu absorbed the auras of life and death, it was still a drop in the bucket!Not enough!Lin Hongyu was extremely anxious, but there was nothing she could do. She was only a fourth level venerable sovereign who controlled the world of life and death. It was already very difficult for her to devour even a little Qi of life and death.Beside Li Hao, a rank eight venerable sovereign kept unleashing all kinds of death spells.It was as if these people had really come back to life.Li Hao's long sword was broken. He punched and moved forward. He exerted the five birds technique to the extreme. Divine runes appeared one after another, suppressing the surroundings, but they were still broken.Li Hao coughed up blood, which was black.At this moment, Li Hao was extremely solemn. This was a difficult path to break!He didn't say anything. In the long river, thousands of worlds appeared, constantly rotating and replacing each other. Soon, the power of tribulation lightning appeared, but it was very weak. The Tribulation lightning struck down with a loud rumble!Countless dead spirits were turned to dust and quickly revived.They couldn't be completely annihilated!If this went on, the Samsara Emperor's energy consumption would be limited, but Li Hao didn't care. He continued to spin the infinite worlds. In the sky, the Samsara Emperor was also watching with amazement in his eyes.Thousands of DAOs appeared, and Li Hao ... Was arranging them!He was operating the power of ten thousand DAOs, hoping to pick one that could restrain the undead spirits and the Dao of death Qi.The great Dao was constantly changing.Soon, Li Hao sorted out life and death. With the Dao of life and death as the main force, a large number of dead spirits collapsed and were absorbed by Li Hao. However, in the blink of an eye ... A muffled groan came from the river. Although the world of life and death had grown stronger, Lin Hongyu could not withstand it and was showing signs of collapse.Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly. Clearly, life and death were too weak. No, they couldn't bear the life and death of reincarnation.He quickly changed and focused on Nirvana recovery. He destroyed a portion of the undead, but he was in danger again ...At this moment, in the Dao world, the two of them displayed their various means.Samsara operated life and death to the extreme. Smoke even began to rise from their bodies, caused by their mental power being far exceeded. However, their eyes were still sharp as they locked onto Li Hao.Can you break my reincarnation?BOOM!With a loud noise, Li Hao was sent flying. At this moment, his body was pitch-black, and the aura of death was spreading out. Opposite him, the powerful figures were all there, but they were much weaker than before.

Chapter 3524 Dao War, Dao Perishing, Samsara Dies!
In the long river, the Martial Master in charge of the boundary could no longer bear it. Nanquan roared,""Quit! I'll be exhausted to death by him ...""Shut up!"Li Hao shouted coldly, and Southern Fist was flustered and exasperated!If this continued, he would really be exhausted to death.Why did this kid insist on a one-on-one fight at this time?Li Hao, on the other hand, panted and looked at the heart in the distance. He frowned slightly. The rules here were set by reincarnation, which was actually quite simple. The dead could be resurrected continuously, consuming energy. The heart was the core. Once the heart was broken, the resurrection would end!However, he found it difficult to break through such a simple rule.The rules!This was the future law he had seen before. It was an application. Of course, reincarnation had involved some of it, but it wasn't too obvious. In reality, it was the future law Dao.It was even more profound than what Li Hao was using now."Life and death reincarnation ..."Li Hao murmured. Although the endless reincarnation cycle would weaken them, he would be weakened even faster. If this went on, he might really not be able to break through.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  No wonder Samsara had the confidence to fight him.Do you regret it?Naturally, he wouldn 't. On the contrary, he laughed. At this moment, Li Hao looked at Samsara and asked curiously,"The cycle of life and death, the creation of laws ... To create laws, you need to fuse the Dao. You've fused the Dao of life and death?"The reincarnation Emperor was shocked. He looked at Li Hao in surprise, but he quickly shook his head. "It's not that I've fused with the Dao, but ... Over the years, I've killed countless people. Countless people have died in the reincarnation realm. These people eventually gathered into spirits, so the Dao of life and death has given birth to some sentience ... Li Hao, you're amazing!"He knew the rules!At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor was also shocked. Li Hao knew that Li Hao's power was indeed mixed with some special power. It turned out that he was also exploring the rules!"That's amazing!"Li Hao complimented. The next moment, he exclaimed,""So that's how it is. You don't need to fuse with the Dao to fuse with the spirit! Life and death. The life and death of countless people had forged Dao spirits .... From the looks of it, the other great DAOs could also be nurtured in the same way. Impressive! I think I understand now ...""Divine text!"At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have realized something."The divine text fuses with the Dao. All living beings cultivate the divine text. Essence, Qi, and spirit are one. The divine text contains the Dao, and one Dao becomes tens of thousands of divine texts. Cultivate the spirit, cultivate the Dao, and contain the spirit!"Combined with what he had seen in the future, he seemed to have completely understood how to cultivate in the future.By combining one's essence, Qi, and spirit, one would condense divine text and a great Dao. Countless people would cultivate, perfect, fuse with the spirit, merge with the Dao, and contain the spirit. The Dao had a spirit, and the rules would be born!So that was how it was!Before this, he didn't see it clearly. He only knew that someone needed to merge with the Dao to give birth to a Dao spirit. Now, he understood that it was an acquired Dao spirit. Great DAOs could produce their own spirits!Billions of people cultivated the same path, regardless of race, gender, or talent. They constructed the same divine text, and they could cultivate the same path! So that was how it was!This was somewhat similar to the Silvermoon Dao Meridian. However, Dao meridians were cultivated separately. Therefore, it was impossible to strengthen the power of one Dao. One had to completely merge the Dao meridians of the same type!At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor's expression changed slightly.Li Hao seemed to have understood something from his words.Of course, now that things had come to this, life and death were inevitable. If he died, it didn't matter if Li Hao knew. If Li Hao died, it didn't matter even more if he knew.Countless venerable sovereigns attacked again from all directions.At this moment, it wasn't just them. Some of the people he had seen when he was traveling not long ago also appeared ... Mixed among the undead spirits were his parents, Zhang Yuan, and some weak cultivators he had killed in the past. For example, in the first sparring session, Li Hao killed the eyebrow-raising stick disciple, sun moxian ... Until now, Li Hao had never forgotten this person.These people had all appeared at this moment.They were either sad or sorrowful, but they all swarmed toward Li Hao. In the sky, the Samsara Emperor watched silently. The Dao of life and death and the Dao of Samsara had the effect of breaking one's Dao heart.Everyone had a weakness, and those who had died might be your weakness.Li Hao, don't you have a weakness?I don't believe it!At this moment, Li Hao was not angry. Even when his parents and Zhang Yuan charged at him, he was not angry. There was only some ... Indescribable melancholy and joy.He seemed to ... Know how to break through the Dao!At this moment, the myriad changes instantly reduced the number of DAOs. In the blink of an eye, the DAOs began to combine. Gradually, some red energy emerged from Li Hao's body. He looked at his friends and family swarming toward him ...At this moment, he looked at Samsara and smiled.""Thank you, Samsara. I've always wanted to try ... But I've always ... Been ... Afraid ... Unable to!"To me, the dead are a little too important.Do you know what my greatest desire is?It wasn't a wish, but a desire!At this moment, the power of the Crimson Moon erupted from Li Hao's body. It was much stronger than the power of desire of the Crimson Moon Emperor."I want to ... Resurrect them!"Li Hao roared crazily,""In reality, I don't dare, I can't ... Here, I dare!"Countless undead spirits?'Then ... Resurrect them, completely resurrect them. If I can't resurrect them in life and death, then I'll resurrect them with desire, with desire, with boundless desire!'

At this moment, his intense desire surpassed everything.Even the reincarnation Emperor's illusory figure trembled. He could feel an intense and boundless Dao of desire. This desire could drive people crazy and make them lose themselves. ……At this moment.Four regions.Red Moon sovereign turned his head abruptly, his eyes filled with shock!Long Zhan turned his head back at the same time. In the distance, in a place far away, in an instant, an extremely strong, extremely rich ... Power of desire erupted!Long Zhan was stunned.Desire?The intense desire even filled the entire void. It was as if someone was shouting and roaring,"I want to ... Resurrect you!"Red Moon Emperor was a little lost and lost.Desire?What kind of desire could be so strong that it far exceeded his Dao of desire? it spread to the entire world. Everyone, all the experts, seemed to hear that crazy roar in their minds."Resurrect!"'I'll use my entire life, give up everything, give up everything, and I'll resurrect you all!'Who should he resurrect?Who was he going to resurrect?……At this moment.The dead world.Countless undead struggled crazily, but they kept mutating. They seemed to be completely resurrected. Li Hao didn't kill them, but resurrected them.The power of desire spread crazily, and the extremely strong desire made countless dead spirits start to revive. They even seemed to have regained their memories and consciousness ...At this moment, a large number of undead spirits suddenly came back to life and rushed toward the Samsara Emperor."Reincarnation!""You're still alive!""Go to hell!"Many of these undead spirits were experts killed by the reincarnation Emperor. However, at this moment, they were revived by their desires. They had gone crazy and rebelled!High up in the sky, the reincarnation monarch was slaying gods.Resurrection ... It was not a resurrection of life and death. It was not the kind of resurrection he had experienced before. It was the resurrection of an undead spirit, but ... The resurrection of memories.Desire!The great Dao of the Crimson Moon world, a very weak level 8 world Dao that had been defeated by Li Hao Long ago ...A great Dao that he didn't care about was actually the nemesis of his life and death Dao."That's right. There are so many people who have died. Without their memories, they are the undead. Once they are completely resurrected, their memories will be awakened ... Many of them are my enemies.BOOM!The endless undead spirits charged at Samsara with ferocious expressions. Some of them also struggled and roared as they charged at Li Hao!Li Hao, on the other hand, laughed heartily!Resurrect them!Wasn't he supposed to be immortal?Then, he would revive them completely and restore their memories. Enemies would still be enemies, but there were a large number of undead spirits, and the enemy was not him.Boom! Boom! Boom!The sound of an explosion was heard as countless undead spirits exploded. The heart started to beat violently. The reincarnation Emperor, who had been maintaining his operation, was now covered by countless undead spirits. They climbed up, revived after dying, and attacked each other again ...They gnawed at the reincarnation Emperor and killed him again and again. However, they were constantly resurrected and a large amount of energy was consumed.The face of the Samsara Emperor turned slightly pale. He looked at Li Hao, who was also wrapped in the attack. At this moment, Li Hao was smiling brightly because, at this moment, Samsara was also dealing with itself. He was using his own power to resurrect the dead and deal with himself!If this went on, he would consume twice as much energy as Li Hao, and Li Hao would probably not be the first to die."Desire ... Little Dao er ... How can you break my reincarnation?"The reincarnation Emperor couldn't believe it. He looked at Li Hao, who was being torn apart by the undead spirits. He was unwilling to accept this. This time, he was really unwilling to accept this. His Dao had already become a rule!Why ... Would it be broken by desire?"How can there be strong or weak DAOs?" Li Hao chuckled."Desire is human nature and the way to be powerful. Hongyue is just a piece of trash. How can she really understand desire?"At this moment, he smiled and looked at Samsara.""Perhaps, in the future, I will thank you, because you let me know that a strong desire may summon back the origin of the people I want to resurrect ... I can resurrect them! Samsara, you've given me some experience!"BOOM!Under the crazy consumption of energy, the heart exploded at this moment.The reincarnation Emperor didn't do anything. Even if he didn't explode, he would still be destroyed by the countless undead spirits.Boom! Boom! Boom!As the heart exploded, the entire world collapsed. Countless undead spirits were annihilated in an instant, including Li Hao's acquaintances. Li Hao didn't even look at them ... Because Dao Ling was the cause of all this.BOOM!A loud sound was heard. In the eyes of others, it was only an instant in the chaos. The Dao of desire roared. In the next moment, the Samsara Emperor suddenly spat out blood. Countless death Qi spread out and his face turned pale.As for Li Hao, he stepped out of the void, and the aura of the reincarnation monarch instantly weakened.Pengcheng and the others were shocked!How could this be?Samsara, who was at the peak of the eighth step, had been defeated by Li Hao in an instant?At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor's face turned pale.His rules, his Dao spirit, his reincarnation ... Had all been broken by Li Hao in this confrontation.He was a little self-deprecating and a little depressed.For cultivators, their great Dao had been broken ... This was the biggest blow. He was proud and believed that reincarnation was unparalleled. Even though his strength was not as good as the overlords, he felt that reincarnation had the greatest potential!However, today ... It was actually destroyed by a mere Dao of desire!He looked at Li Hao and smiled."Desire ... Of course, it's not the kind of desire that trash like red Moon has. He's not worthy ... Li Hao ... Perhaps, it's not just desire, but ... Infinite madness!" Isn't it?"It was unbelievable that Li Hao was so eager to resurrect those mortals!Was there anything worth reminiscing about in the mortal world?"Are you ... Going to take away my time?" Li Hao was calm."Cough cough ...""I'm not leaving ..." Reincarnation Emperor laughed."Why don't you ... Let me see what real time is? can you use the power of time?""As you wish!"At this moment, Li Hao waved his hand, and the infinite worlds reappeared. A star gathered, and time seemed to have frozen."This is not my time. This is the time of the battle between the neo martial artists and the heavenly Emperor ... No, the time of the battle between the heavenly Emperor and the yin-yang world!"Li Hao murmured. The time sword intent appeared again and he slashed at him!Pengcheng and the others were shocked!Samsara was already heavily injured. If he took this sword, he would probably die. Seeing that Li Hao was also heavily injured, he wanted to intervene. However, the Samsara Emperor turned to him and shouted coldly,"Get lost!"The roar stunned the three emperors Peng and Cheng.In the next moment, the Samsara Emperor's Samsara grinders reappeared. It was broken, but it was still high-spirited and roared,""Born in the East, die in the East. I admit defeat in the battle of Dao!"  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  He had lost the battle of Dao!It wasn't anything else, but that his Dao had been broken. He had to die in battle. There was no unwillingness, only frustration!"But I still want to take a look at it. It's known as the most powerful Dao in chaos, the Dao of time!In the next moment, he seemed to have fallen into time. His memories flashed, and the past and future appeared. He stood on the river and the sword fell. He seemed to have seen something and the sword fell from the top of his head!The reincarnation Emperor looked at the end of the river and suddenly laughed."Li Hao ... In the future ... Even in life and death ... He will still be powerful! Desire is no match for life and death!"BOOM!The sound of an explosion reverberated through the chaos and the sound of reincarnation still shook the surroundings."Desire is no match for life and death!"I saw it!Li Hao, I saw it, you know?In the future, I'll win, not the path of desire!BOOM! BOOM! The great path collapsed. At this moment, the commotion was unimaginable. An expert with close to 6000 Dao paths, who had even mastered some rules, had completely fallen under this sword.There was only one sentence that spread everywhere.Desire was no match for life and death!It's me who is no match for you, Li Hao.

Chapter 3526 Dingding (1)
Reincarnation had fallen!The Samsara Emperor's desire was no match for his life, and his Samsara was broken. However, he didn't escape. Instead, he chose to fight to the end and witness the passing of time, only to be killed by Li Hao's sword.The most powerful man in the East had fallen."My King!""Daoist master!"“……”A sorrowful cry resounded through the heavens and earth.The seventh rank venerable sovereigns of the reincarnation realm were all in disbelief.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  In a one-on-one fight, Samsara died.He was killed by Li Hao!The Silver Moon King, who had just left the four-sided region, had actually killed the reincarnation Emperor.At that moment, Peng Cheng and the other venerable sovereigns were even more shocked.It was dangerous!He was finished!Samsara had actually been killed by Li Hao so quickly!At this moment, venerable sovereign Pengcheng spat out a world. He was about to escape and didn't dare to stay any longer. Seeing that the other party was about to escape, Li Hao, who was very weak behind, frowned slightly."Take the people from the Samsara realm!" You promised Samsara, are you going to break your promise now?"As soon as he said that, venerable Pengcheng, who was about to escape, was shocked.This ...Even Samsara was killed by you. What is the meaning of this?As for Li Hao, his tone was extremely calm,'you're a level 8, do you have to be so timid? Not to mention that I'm extremely weak right now, even if I'm at my peak, since we've already agreed on this, I won't do anything to you!"Paragon Pengcheng's heart trembled with fear, but at this moment, he still stopped.It wasn't just because of Li Hao's words, but also because ... There were many other experts in the reincarnation realm. There were quite a few seventh level venerable sovereigns, and a large number of middle and low level venerable sovereigns.And now, Samsara was dead.In fact, the huntian realm didn't suffer any losses. None of its venerable sovereigns had died. In several confrontations, they had all survived. The ones who had died were the venerable sovereigns of the Eastern Region.Of course, the huntian realm's arrangements in the East were all for naught!Sun and moon, earth-splitting, Gemini, reincarnation ...The arrangements of so many worlds had turned into nothing.In fact, the loss was huge!At this moment, if he could bring back the remaining venerable sovereigns in the reincarnation realm, it would be a great achievement.After a moment of hesitation, he stopped.The remaining two grade-8 experts didn't dare to make a sound. Venerable sovereign Pengcheng carefully glanced at Li Hao. At this moment, Li Hao was extremely weak. Venerable sovereign Pengcheng knew that he would have to pay a price for killing Samsara, but ... Even if he saw it, he didn't have the guts to go against Li Hao.He was really scared out of his wits!Earth Spirit, buzzing, reincarnation ...Even if these venerable sovereigns were not strong?In the end, they were all killed by Li Hao.Even an Overlord like long Zhan had been forced back to Sifang region by Li Hao's tricks. How could he dare to attack Li Hao at this time? at this moment, in his eyes, Li Hao ... Could not be defeated unless he was an Overlord!Unless the three overlords or long Zhan personally made a move, otherwise, in Peng Cheng's opinion, no one in the entire chaos could suppress this person!"Thank you ... Thank you, Silver Moon King, for helping me ..."They were clearly the greatest enemies, but at this moment, Peng Cheng thanked them. He felt uneasy and quickly looked at the reincarnation realm's venerable sovereigns and shouted,""Evacuate with the people ... Leave the reincarnation universe ..."A seventh level venerable sovereign was furious. He gritted his teeth and roared,""Kill him, my Lord ..."He thought that he might still have a chance at this moment.Samsara was dead, but Li Hao was also heavily injured. It was impossible for him to be completely unharmed.However, in the next moment, Pengcheng's eyes glinted fiercely. Are you crazy?At this time, should he still provoke the other party?In a flash, his speed was extremely fast. With a loud bang, the seventh rank venerable sovereign was directly smashed into pieces. His strong physical body was fully displayed at this moment. He shouted,""Before the reincarnation Emperor died, he asked me to take you away. Otherwise ... Who would care about your life? Quickly, leave the universe and leave with me!"A Grade 7 was nothing in front of him.As for Li Hao, he raised his head and looked over. Venerable sovereign Pengcheng was also looking at him, and when he saw Li Hao's gaze, his heart skipped a beat.Li Hao didn't say anything.Bullying the weak and fearing the strong, or something else ... These people were not his own people, but his enemies. He did not kill them because he had agreed to reincarnation, and also because Li Hao was extremely weak at the moment.Countless worlds were collapsing.Many of the stars that time had scattered had already shattered. Some of the realms that were guarded by the spirit bodies were still fine, but there were thousands of spirit bodies. The remaining DAOs that were not guarded by anyone were all shattering.The powerful force was dissipating.He did not try to hide it. In fact, at this moment, he was truly weak, and Pengcheng could see it.Thunderlord and the others were very nervous and protected Li Hao in the middle, but venerable sovereign Pengcheng had no intention of retaliating.Li Hao didn't seem to be afraid of his counterattack.Although the reincarnation realm's venerable sovereigns were unwilling, some of them were extremely afraid. At this moment, they began to leave the great path universe. They even ... Didn't dare to destroy it forcefully.With Samsara's death, these people's energy had been interrupted by Li Hao.Soon, the venerable sovereigns left the universe one by one.Paragon Pengcheng, on the other hand, was extremely nervous. He looked at the world and said nervously,""I don't have a realm, so it's not convenient for me to bring mortals with me ...""As you wish!""If that's the case, Daoist Pengcheng," Li Hao said calmly."Please return as soon as possible and tell huntian Supreme Emperor that Li Hao is no match for huntian today. Tomorrow, I'll avenge the siege of the Monarchs in huntian realm!"

Chapter 3527 Dingding (1)
Venerable sovereign Pengcheng didn't dare to say anything harsh. Although Li Hao's words were a little arrogant, it wasn't impossible for Pengcheng.A rookie who had risen to power in just a few years and was able to kill Samsara. Would you dare to not believe his ruthless words?Without saying anything, he took the other two rank eights and many venerable sovereigns and quickly fled.At this moment, he couldn't care about other places.However, at this moment ... In the distance, Emperor extreme Frost's angry roar reverberated through the heavens and earth."Bastard! You're just going to leave like this?""Damn it!""Bastard!"He went crazy. He screamed and roared.That was because at least five or six level eight venerable sovereigns had escaped the moment reincarnation had fallen.Yes, Li Hao didn't have the time or time to rescue them. However, when Samsara died, at least five or six level eight venerable sovereigns ran away in fear!They were afraid that Li Hao would come to their rescue when he recovered. Therefore, in the blink of an eye, a group of people escaped.Now, when Peng Cheng was about to retreat, the venerable sovereigns who were still holding on saw that the situation was hopeless and fled. Extreme frost monarch also wanted to escape but he didn't have the chance.The human King had been staring at him!At this moment, the human King was also extremely ruthless. He gritted his teeth and laughed wildly."Damn it, are you running? Only you can! No one else can stand out, but you can, right?"He didn't care about the others at all and madly swung his blade at the other party!At this moment, no one stopped him.Out of the 15 eighth level venerable sovereigns, two of them from the extreme Ice world had been killed. As for the Supreme sovereigns and the others, they had also killed one and three. Now, most of them had run away. Only this guy was unlucky. He had been targeted and could not escape no matter how hard he tried."I surrender, I'm willing to surrender ..." Extreme frost monarch was anxious.After this battle, the eastern Alliance had completely collapsed!With his death, there were only 11 type 8 powerhouses left in the East.Originally, there were still many who dared to fight. Would the remaining 11 really dare to go against the new martial artist Silver Moon?What a joke!This time, many people might have to escape from this place, completely escape, or even abandon the universe."It's too late!"The human King bellowed. This time, it was unknown whether he was angry because of Li Hao's limelight or because Extreme Ice had not died yet.The long saber was completely broken!Heaven and earth seemed to have turned into a purgatory. With a crazy slash, the extreme frost Thearch's frozen world was instantly shattered. At this moment, the extreme frost Thearch was truly in despair. He cursed madly,"Huntian, five elements, spring and autumn ... You are all animals ... Whoever believes you is seeking death ..."He believed the three overlords 'words, saying that they could destroy new martial and silver Moon, and allow Extreme Ice to unify the East.In the end, it was bullshit.Is this your plan? A group of level 8 martial artists had died!Even Samsara was killed. Now ... I'm going to follow in Samsara's footsteps. I regret it. If I knew this would happen, I would have cooperated with Samsara. If they had cooperated, they would have unified the East.Now, it was torn apart and the cycle of reincarnation was destroyed. He ... Was going to die.BOOM!Along with a violent explosion, Extreme Ice Emperor cursed and died. He was unwilling to die in such a lowly way.The human King panted heavily and sneered.The three frozen idiots were all dead.Yes, in his eyes, these guys were extremely stupid. They ... Actually wanted to unify the East?Are you even worthy?Do you have the ability?Samsara was better off serving the three overlords than Samsara. Samsara still had the initiative and had even mobilized many grade 8 experts to participate in the battle. The three idiots of Extreme Ice had emptied their pockets and started serving the three overlords without any benefits. Now ... They had nothing.He turned his head to look at Li Hao's battlefield in the distance.The human King spat out a mouthful of blood and spat. He couldn't help but curse in a low voice,"Bastard ... How did you do it?"Yes, he was very surprised.Li Hao had actually killed Samsara's team in succession. This was unbelievable.The Supreme martial artist panted. The book of Dao was a little tattered. At this moment, he also looked over and smiled."He ... Broke the time barrier!"The human King nodded.He felt it and sighed,"it's a good thing, but ... It's still a pity. If he can't recover, it'll be even more of a pity. This guy's heavenly Daoist Rite ... I'm afraid it'll be wasted."At this moment, he was looking in the direction of the four-sided domain.The lightning tribulation over there had almost dissipated.Outside the square region, a figure seemed to cover the entire square region. It was long Zhan. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ At this moment, in the sky above the four-sided domain.Long Zhan defeated all the lightning tribulations. He panted slightly and looked into the distance. In his hand, he held a piece of divine text that was constantly fluctuating. Soon, it turned into a Li Hao and appeared in front of him.Long Zhan looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao also looked at long Zhan.Long Zhan took the lead to open his mouth.This time, the three-party Alliance's plan to kill the new warrior Silver Moon was completely destroyed. Long Zhan's plan to achieve a balance was also destroyed by Li Hao.One had to admit that long Zhan admired this guy very much.At this critical moment, he actually triggered the lightning tribulation and transferred him away. Although he was very displeased, reality proved that this move was used too timely. Otherwise, long Zhan wouldn't have let Samsara be killed by Li Hao.After this battle, other than the three overlords, who still had the strength to deal with Li Hao and the others, even on his side, only he still had some deterrence. In fact, long Zhan also felt some danger at this moment.

Chapter 3528 Dingding (3)
Yes, danger!The East had collapsed!Those grade-8 cultivators had either escaped or died. This time, perhaps no one would dare to stay. Even if they did, they would have to bow their heads and submit. To be honest, he did not expect it to happen so quickly!He had thought that if the two of them joined forces, they would be able to take down the East, but it would definitely not be so fast or so easy.Moreover, he would not let them off so easily.The result ... Was unexpected.In just a few months, less than a year had passed since Li Hao's group left the four-sided domain, but the two sides had completely settled the matter in the East.Reincarnation, Extreme Ice, Gemini, sun and moon, earth-splitting ...These worlds had all collapsed. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Dongfang's spine was broken.On the side of the three overlords, Earth Spirit and Feng Ming had been killed. Next, the two clans had to be careful of huntian because they didn't suffer any losses. At least, they didn't suffer any losses on the surface. These two clans were probably having a headache right now.They probably didn't expect that they would fail, nor did they expect that Li Hao would only kill their people and not exterminate Pengcheng and the others.Of the three rank eights, not a single one had died. They had even brought back quite a number of rank seven venerable sovereigns.Li Hao ... Was probably doing this on purpose."It's alright, it's nothing. "Li Hao replied. While long Zhan also recovered his calm and smiled,""You didn't kill Pengcheng and the others so that huntian could invade the northern and southern regions?"Li Hao laughed and shook his head. At this moment, I am indeed very weak. If senior long Zhan were to make a move, I'm afraid that even the human King and I would find it difficult to resist ...""You must be joking."Long Zhan laughed lightly."At this moment, if I leave the four regions, perhaps ... You can't wait to see it, right?"He then continued,"Tian Fang is probably about to return. I can already feel it. Many venerable sovereigns have died. The East has been unified. It will be too late if they don't return!""Today, I'll take advantage of this opportunity to ask you something ... Will you help them when they return?" his eyes were solemn. Li Hao thought for a moment and said, I'll definitely help the three Daoists, Coiling Dragon, Huo Yan, and Shui Ling, when they return! I don't care what you do, I don't care what you want to do. These three people not only have to return, but they have to return safely! Either they stay in tianfang universe or ... Take away their Dao stars. In short, I'll protect these three people!"At this moment, he had the qualifications to stand in front of long Zhan and say these words.Li Hao's shadow trembled and smiled,"if senior stops us ... Then we'll start the war!" If senior is willing to help this junior, this junior has no intention of fighting to the end with senior at this stage. There is not much meaning to it! The three overlords can't wait for us to fight ..."Long Zhan's eyes were somewhat deep,"Li Hao, I'm willing to fulfill your wish!" I don't want to be your enemy now, but if the three of you want to control the tianfang great Dao universe ... This might be a problem. If the three of you are determined to fight me and hinder my plan, it will also be troublesome. At that time ... I'm afraid I won't be able to care about that!"His eyes were cold."Also ... Don't think that Tian Fang ... Is on your side. If you think so, you're wrong!"Li Hao laughed,"I've never thought of it!" It's not just Tian Fang. I, Silver Moon, and neo martial have such a close relationship that I've never felt that neo martial belongs to Silver Moon. Of course, Silver Moon ... Is not part of neo martial either! In this world, everyone lives for themselves. There are no pure good and bad people. You, long Zhan, are not a good person in my eyes, but in the eyes of the primal Chaos race, you are a Saint, a Saint Emperor!""So ... We all have our own interests. However, it is also a fact that I owe tianfang a favor."Long Zhan nodded his head."On the day of Tian Fang's return, if the three of them don't cause me too much trouble, I will let them go in exchange for your disregard. If the three of them insist on interfering ... You, Li Hao, can come and take them away. I will also give you face ... If that's not enough ... Then ... We will start a war!""Thank you, senior!" Li Hao smiled."Senior ... Can you match a tier 9?"Long Zhan laughed coldly,"in the current chaos, how can there be a true tier 9?! Without the 9000 great Dao laws, how could he be considered a level nine? Then huntian was a true grade nine? As for Tian Fang, even if the Lord of Tian Fang returns, he can't really have the power of a rank nine!"Li Hao was deep in thought. No wonder this person dared to plot against Tian Fang.He had already determined that if Tian Fang returned that day, there was a high chance that he would be with the master of Tian Fang. Of course, it might just be a clone projection or something, but it definitely wouldn't be any worse than hun Tian.Long Zhan should also have some understanding, but had the idea of beating Tian Fang all along. This fellow's heart was not small.While long Zhan did not say much either and opened his mouth once more,""Cut off the connection with the Phoenix Flame. I'll let your Holy prose go so that it doesn't break. It'll be a waste."Li Hao smiled, senior ... You're really interesting! Once the divine script of calamity is broken, the connection between me and Phoenix Flame will naturally be broken ..."Long Zhan sneered,"could it be that you're unable to condense it again? Why do you have to do such a childish thing with me? if you cut off the connection with Feng Yan, I'll let go of your tribulation character, and you'll also be spared from trouble. Why do you have to leave some trouble behind?"That's right!Li Hao nodded and said regretfully,"then ... Let's do this!" Actually, I quite like Princess Feng Yan, and I don't have any intention of harming her ..."No one would believe this!The seemingly gentle Li Hao, in long Zhan's eyes, was much more vicious than the human King.

Chapter 3529 Dingding (3)
This time, they were threatening him, a beast of primordial chaos, with the lives of countless humans and primordial chaos beings in the square domain ... Was this something a human would do?No one would believe it even if it spread!It had always been the chaos that devoured worlds and threatened human experts with worlds. This time, the situation was reversed. He was threatened by Li Hao, which was a joke.However, this joke had really happened!Do you dare to believe it?Li Hao waved his hand, and a Thunderbolt seemed to appear in the void. In the distance, Phoenix Flame Thearch grunted, and a contract in the depths of his soul seemed to be completely broken.Supreme Emperor Phoenix Flame had just been seriously injured. At this moment, he felt that the contract had been terminated. He was angry and remorseful. If it weren't for her, he might not have been affected so much.The entire square region was affected. She was furious."Li Hao, you despicable man ..."Yes, Li Hao was a villain.In Feng Yan's eyes, this man was extremely shameless. He actually threatened his father with countless humans. Hateful, detestable, and shameful!"Didn't you keep saying that the chaos race devoured the human race, and that you killed my chaos race ... You killed my mother and the other chaos races. Today, what you have done is a hundred times more detestable than what we have done ..."Li Hao nodded."Yes, even I hate myself for being too shameless. But as a martial artist, it's better to be shameless when you're down and out so that you can live!"Li Hao chuckled and wasn't annoyed."My master once told me not to lose my life for so-called face. I should bear with it, give in, and give in. I'm afraid of senior long Zhan, and I have no choice but to use this underhanded method ... Next time, I might use it again."He laughed."Of course, if I'm strong enough to fight you head on next time, I won't resort to such underhanded means. Princess Feng Yan, don't be angry. Since ancient times, the winner is the king and the loser is the villain. If I die, you can do whatever you want. If I win ... It's for the human race and for justice. I didn't really kill hundreds of millions of humans ..."Shameless!At this moment, Feng Yan was so angry that he was trembling.While long Zhan also laughed,"what a good winner takes all! I've underestimated you. When you killed so many people in the Dragon field, I thought you were just a hypocrite. But it seems that I was wrong. You're a real villain!""Be it a hypocrite, or a real villain ..."Li Hao chuckled again."Everything will be judged by future generations. Today, we are all involved. Who is qualified to judge who?" I have something to do, so I'll take my leave first. Thank you, senior, for protecting my divine text!""Father!" At this moment, Feng Yan roared. He couldn't let Li Hao's divine text go.A single divine rune was nothing, but this was a divine rune of calamity. It was very powerful and could even connect to the lightning territory. It was very dangerous, so it was better to destroy it!While long Zhan raised his hand!He had stopped everyone!"Thank you, senior!" Li Hao also smiled.As soon as he finished speaking, the divine text floated and fled into the distance. His voice echoed,""Princess Feng Yan, you're still too young. You should gain more experience!""You ..."Feng Yan was furious! Long Zhan, on the other hand, did not say a word. Only after Li Hao left did he slowly say,""Don't get angry so easily. It's meaningless. It's only useless rage!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "But ..."Feng Yan was unwilling to give up. No matter what, he had to leave Li Hao's divine text behind. How could he let him go?Long Zhan glanced into the distance and said softly,""There's not much point in shattering his Holy prose. On the contrary, you'll be completely against him. That's the first reason. The second ..."He glanced at the lightning territory around him."It might cause a second riot in the lightning territory. That would only add to the trouble!"Feng Yan was helpless. At this moment, he felt a little sullen.Black Tiger and the others were the same. They were all helpless.Red Moon sovereign, who was still immersed in the previous scene, seemed to have just woken up at this moment. He was a little dazed and said,""Li Hao killed Samsara with the path of desire!"How was that possible?I am the owner of desire!Long Zhan nodded his head."You know now that desire ... Isn't weak anymore, right? The weak ones are humans, not DAOs!"Red Moon master was speechless.Samsara!He was a cultivator with nearly 6000 Dao, a true top-notch expert. In the end, he was killed by the Dao of desire, breaking the great Dao and breaking the cycle of reincarnation ... This ... Was something he had never thought of.For a moment, he was a little dazed.I ... Don't seem to be as powerful as Li Hao, who wields the path of desire.It was laughable.……The battle in the East began to stop.Li Hao had killed five level eight venerable sovereigns, while the human King had killed four.In one battle, he had killed nine rank eights.Moreover, they were all experts.This time, some of the rank eight venerable sovereigns who died were quite powerful.
