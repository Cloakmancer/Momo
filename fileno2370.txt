Even a half-step Emperor would be able to rush into the great Dao universe in an instant, right?Wasn't this courting death?The moon goddess was puzzled,'is this a trap? Is he deliberately luring everyone out, such as you and Zheng Yu? once you rush out, he will quickly withdraw the Dao universe ... And then let you be suppressed by the world, causing the seal to break?"That was a possibility!But ... If it really did descend, would you be able to take it just because you said so?Li Hao, if you really had such strength, you wouldn't be at the fourth level of Dao integration but the ninth level!The sword-bearing man also fell into deep thought. After a long time, he said,""It's hard to judge!" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Right now, there were almost no clues, so it was indeed difficult to make a judgment.At this moment, he also felt that Li Hao had lost control. He had completely lost control.A person that you can't guess at all."It's probably a trap. He won't court his own death!"The sword-carrying man said softly,"he should know that there is a great possibility that we will enter the great Dao universe directly! Even if he doesn't appear near us ... It doesn't matter. Your main body can move, and so can Hurricane city ... An instant is enough!"This was an act of seeking death!But was Li Hao the kind of person who would court death?How could he not know what everyone was thinking?He was very clear!Therefore, there must be a trap!The moon goddess hesitated."Will he do the opposite? will he ... Will he really hope for the great Dao to descend and turn the entire Silver Moon into a Holy Land for cultivation?" Of course, if the Silver Moon becomes a Holy Land, it'll also be a boost for me! After all, I'm still the heart of the Silver Moon ... It'll be quite beneficial to him as well, and he'll probably be able to produce a group of powerful beings!"At this moment, it was impossible to figure out Li Hao's thoughts.Countless smart people in the world were trying to figure this out.Be it Zhang an, Ying Hongyue, or the God of beginner martial arts ...These existences were all guessing.Everyone thought that there was a trap, but ... Where was the trap?……Even Li Hao's close friends were at a loss.Qian Wuliang, Lin Hongyu, and Hong Yitang were all frowning and thinking hard. They could sense the danger and didn't think that Li Hao would seek death on purpose. Therefore, there must be a trap.More importantly ... If you're faking it, we're all experts here, and we can easily tell.If you do it for real ... You'll easily kill yourself!Li Hao, what are you thinking?……In the sky above Heavenly Star City.In heaven battling city.At this moment, there was only one Dao integration expert beside Li Hao, and that was the Black Panther. The Black Panther didn't understand it either, but it didn't care.Li Hao's voice resounded throughout the entire city,"all monster plants, release the spring of life at all costs. Spread it all over the central continent!" As long as I, Li Hao, still have it, I'll definitely repay you all!"The Emperor Guard's voice rang out,"we will definitely do our best!" Lord Marquis, don't worry. The Yao plant Army will not leave behind any ..." "Go!"One by one, the monster plants rose into the air. Dozens of monster plants scattered in all directions. This time, it seemed that Li Hao was really going to do it at all costs. In that case ... He would do it.Drops of the spring of life fell from the sky and turned into the water of life.At this moment, everyone in the world was shocked.This was not just one place, but the whole world.The dozens of monster plants ... Even if they used up everything, it would only be a drop in the bucket. At the same time, the divine power stones, energy stones ... All the resources that could be used were brought out by Li Hao's men.A large number of energy stones were shattered, and countless energy spilled out.This scene was witnessed by everyone and shocked them.It's not going to be long?If he didn't reserve anything ... How would the experts cultivate in the future? After all the powerhouses were exhausted ... It was still very troublesome to recover once. If you didn't leave any resources behind, did you want to just fight one battle and end it?But Li Hao didn't care about this.He only ordered the powerhouses to release all the energy in the city.Soon, the five main cities also began to release their energy.Not only that ... Li Hao had also ordered that the five major cities would be the array cores of the five major cities. They would consume all their reserves to consolidate the world and welcome the arrival of the new Dao universe!……At the northern border.Ying Hongyue furrowed her brows and thought hard. She muttered,"What are you doing? This madman ... What is he trying to do!"He didn't understand!However, he knew that perhaps it was to strike a blow to some people, such as Zheng Yu and Li daoheng ...However, how could he do it?Li Hao's intention was written all over his face, but no one could see through it. This feeling was too uncomfortable.……At the same time.Hurricane city.Zheng Yu looked at the Queen in front of him and said softly,""Perhaps ... We really need to cooperate. The Galaxy city has locked onto us. If the great Dao really descends, perhaps ... I will have to enter the moon. It's just that ... You ..."He looked at the Queen and said,"you are a very troublesome person!" I'm worried that if I really work with you, I'll be in a desperate situation!"Zheng Yu seemed a little helpless.The Queen was also speechless. What was he saying?At this moment, she was also a little puzzled and said,""You mean, if the great path universe really descends ... And Hurricane city can't move, you will rush into the great path universe with me?"Zheng Yu nodded slightly.The Queen said heavily,"then isn't that satisfying Li Hao's needs?" He might have made such a big move just to lure you out of Hurricane city!""I know." Zheng Yu nodded."But if ... The opportunity is really right in front of me, do you think I can reject it?"

"I know," he mumbled."Li Hao might be doing this for Hurricane city ... But ... If the great path of the universe is really right in front of me ... Do you think I should take a gamble?"The Queen thought for a moment and nodded. Yes!If it were me, I would also take a gamble!Moreover, he was a half-step sovereign, an unrivaled expert."What if the great Dao universe is fake?" she asked."Can't you and I tell if it's real or fake?"Zheng Yu laughed."Don't forget that you also have a Natal star ... Since Li Hao has made such a big move, it's possible that it's fake, but the possibility is very small ... I suspect that he has some tricks up his sleeve in the Dao universe. As for the fake Dao universe, do you think we Heavenly Kings and half-emperors are blind?"Everyone in the world was watching. It was too difficult to fake!The Queen thought about it and felt that it made sense.Now that she heard these people's words, they all made sense, but ... The Queen continued,""I can send you in, but I won't go in myself! You're a pseudo-Emperor and can resist it, but I can 't! Even if it was a Dao universe, it might be very dangerous! So ... After I send you in, I'll leave. If you agree, I'll agree!""It's best to bring Hurricane city with us," he said."Otherwise, I'm worried that Li Hao is doing this for Hurricane city."Although it didn't look like it, who could say for sure?Zheng Yu pondered for a while and nodded slightly. However, Hurricane city was a big city, after all, and its reaction speed was not that fast. Besides, Star River City was also watching him. Although the one from the Zhang family could not match him and could not take Hurricane city, it would be troublesome if he was entangled."Sir, if you enter the Dao universe ... That Li Hao ... Will really come to take over Hurricane city ..." A Heavenly King said in a deep voice.Zheng Yu looked at them for a long time before he said slowly,""Seven Heavenly King stage powerhouses! Even if Li Hao's side has a scheme, even if they've entangled me, even if they want to seize ... Can't the seven Heavenly Kings resist for even a moment?"He was a little angry and said in a low voice,"there are seven Heavenly Kings in total!" Li Hao is only at the fourth level of Dao integration. If he really has a scheme, he'll have to spare time to deal with us. More than ten Dao integration Silver Moon Saints are all around ... How many people does Li Hao have? Even if Zhang an and the others are nearby ... Do you really not have the slightest confidence in a few mere Saints?"He even wanted to get angry!Even if there was a conspiracy, I would be taking the greatest risk when I entered the Dao universe. Could the seven of you really not stop a fourth-level Dao integration cultivator?He actually asked such a question!Are you guys still considered neo martial artists?In the new martial era, the seven Heavenly Kings dared to besiege and kill a pseudo-Emperor. Even if they failed, they would never be timid!Damn it! Bastard!At this moment, he was really a little angry. Although he didn't care about these people, these people really made him extremely disappointed and desperate."I'm not the only one," Zheng Yu said coldly."Li daoheng will also take the initiative to welcome his provocation!" In other words, Li Hao had to deal with two half-emperors! At that time, if he still had the energy to deal with you ... You would be able to kill him even if you self-destruct! Besides, this time, be it Ying Hongyue or the Heaven's Will, they might exhaust all of their resources to deal with him. He's going to fight against all the experts in the land of the Silver Moon!"Since Li Hao was so arrogant, of course he had to fight!If the seven Heavenly Kings couldn't defend Hurricane city at this time ... Then what were they even needed for? The Heavenly Kings were a little embarrassed.Neo martial Heavenly King?Do we ... Really count?"In the land of Silver Moon, we're not considered as neo martial arts Kings. Besides, we betrayed neo martial ... Let's not keep saying that we're neo martial arts Kings. We're just a group of people who haven't experienced the death battle in the early stage of neo martial arts.The Heavenly Kings didn't say anything else, but they were still a little nervous.As for the Queen, she secretly pouted.A group of Heavenly Kings ... What a bunch of trash.He could now be considered a Heavenly King. Although he was a little afraid of Li Hao ... He still dared to resist when he encountered Li Hao!I once almost killed Li Hao!Li Hao's casual action made the pseudo-Emperor and Heavenly King feel as if they were sitting on pins and needles ... At this moment, the Queen also felt that this guy was really strange. Why was everyone so afraid of him?……The world was in an uproar.Li Hao's plan of summoning the great Dao universe was still in progress.Everyone was waiting and watching.At this moment, Li Hao was sitting cross-legged in heaven battling city, motionless.The world of his spirit sea kept changing. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The spirit Sea World formed by the three saints was very powerful ... But it was still possible for it to be seen through.That's right, it was the spirit Sea World.This was exactly what Li Hao was thinking. The so-called summoning of the great Dao universe ... Not to mention that he didn't have the ability to do so, even if he did, the chances were slim. Only by summoning the spirit Sea World could he deceive Zheng Yu and the others into entering."In the world of the spirit sea, the three saints are all at the peak of the Saint realm. Ordinary Heavenly Kings can't see through them. In addition to my bright moon sword intent ... The stars are also real ... But ... There's still a great possibility that my true half-step sovereign body can see through them the moment I enter ..."What to do?This was Li Hao's biggest problem!If he was seen through instantly, the other party would immediately destroy him, and that would be a heavy loss."Unless ..."Li Hao thought that unless ... He could draw out that star again, he might not be able to freeze the pseudo-Emperor, but he would definitely be able to let the pseudo-Emperor feel the vastness and the mysteriousness of the world of spirit sea!

However, that thing had been stabbed by him last time, and there was nothing new recently. It would be difficult to lure it out!"Novelty ... Must be related to Dao!"No matter how novel it was, the other party wouldn't care. Only something novel about the great Dao would make the other party appear. The other party was the core of the Dao.Li Hao calculated step by step. He couldn't afford to make a single mistake.One wrong step, and he would be consigned to eternal damnation!But if I go the right way ... I can send Zheng Yu into the void Dao universe and let him play with li daoheng!And I can take back Hurricane city.He could also ... Directly kill Ying Hongyue. Not only that, he could even draw out the Heaven's Will and get rid of it ... This time, he might be able to get rid of a few big problems and create an opportunity for li daoheng and Zheng Yu to kill each other.Many thoughts flashed through his mind.His eyes revealed rays of golden light. Black Panther felt a headache for Li Hao. Thinking so much all day long ... He would go bald sooner or later!How tragic!As for Li Hao, his biggest problem now was to hide from the two half-emperors ... Li daoheng was probably not the real li daoheng, so it was still easy to deal with. But Zheng Yu ... How could the time star appear again?Also ... That God of beginner martial might be able to see through it. I hope it's as he said, he won't meddle in other people's business. Otherwise ... Once he's exposed, it'll be troublesome.Suddenly, Li Hao looked at Black Panther, his eyes shining."Heibao ... I need your help!""Woof woof woof?"Black Panther's eyes widened.me?How can I help? I'm so weak, so useless.Li Hao suddenly laughed. He thought of something, and a book of Dao suddenly appeared in his hand."Black Panther, there are countless great DAOs in this book of the great Dao ... Although it's not the true Dao of a venerable sovereign, if you can devour the book of the great Dao and temporarily merge with the 10000 DAOs ... Will you be able to unleash powerful great Dao fluctuations? I don't need you to do anything. What do you think?"“……”Heibao trembled. I feel like I'm going to be beaten to death by Zhang an!The book of Dao was his core Dao.He had swallowed it ..."Don't be afraid ... It won't be a big problem if you spit it out later! Of course, this isn't safe either. However, the other party might not appear ..." Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Thinking of this, Li Hao added,"Black Panther, I'll ask the Imperial Guards to cooperate with you and have them summon Emperor Cang's Palace ... I think Emperor Cang is also the core of a great Dao. If we use the core to connect the core, we might have a chance ... What do you think?" Woof! Woof! Woof!"You agree? So obedient!"The Black Panther wanted to cry, but had no tears. Li Hao quickly calculated. Was there any hope of luring it out like this?Maybe ... Just a little bit more!"Perhaps, I still need the help of another person, such as ... The Queen. With half a moon, which is also considered the core Dao of the Silver Moon, can we lure out this time star?If it was still not enough ... Then it would be very troublesome!He gently stroked the Black Panther, which was restless."I just rejected him, not agreed. Li Hao's comprehension is so poor ... I think I'm going to be unlucky again!"Following Li Hao had brought him a lot of benefits, but every time ... This guy only knew how to cheat dogs!At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered.""If it's not enough ... I'll take over Hurricane city as soon as possible, summon the blood saber, and use the resurrected cat to seduce the star ... Or ... I won't use this. I'll use the Dao of illusions to summon my past and present lives!"At this moment, Li Hao made a decision!No matter what, this time, I have to hook up with this star.As for his trump card being exposed ... What did it matter?"If I succeed this time, I'll become stronger, more confident, and have trump cards. Without strength, it's useless no matter how many trump cards I have!And ... I wonder if that venerable sovereign can help this time?He did not know if that star had sent that trace of blood into the void Dao universe. If it did not ... There might be some trouble this time."Ying Hongyue ..."Li Hao muttered. It had been a long time.In fact, I could have killed you long ago, all the way until today!The two half-step sovereigns aren't my goal this time.You're the one, you know?A smile appeared on Li Hao's face. That's right, this time, the rest of the plans were just preparations to assist in killing Ying Hongyue. Only by completing the other plans would he be able to kill Ying Hongyue without any worries!I think, this time, it's time for you to end this!Li Hao's eyes glowed with ferocity!It had been four years!My parents have been dead for four years. It's time for you to pay me back.

Chapter 2373 The Reappearance Of Time (1)
Time slowly passed.In the outside world, countless people were looking forward to the heaven and earth merging with the great Dao.Until three days later.Countless sky screens appeared.Li Hao's figure reappeared in the world with boundless Majesty, and his shout resounded in the world."Today, I summon the universe of the great path, enter the human world, and strengthen my Silvermoon world!"In an instant, the heavens and earth were turned upside down!At this moment, the sky seemed to have collapsed.At the same time, billions of stars appeared between heaven and earth. It was the feeling of the true great Dao descending.Under the countless stars, something suddenly seemed to tremble.At this moment ... Someone seemed to have stood up among the stars.One of them turned into a Galaxy.The sound of flowing water appeared between heaven and earth, and everyone seemed to hear it. This was Li Hao, who had turned into a long river and stood up from the universe of the great path.This scene shocked countless people.It was like a giant that could cover the sky and earth. At this moment, it stood up, stood up, and looked at everyone across the universe.……"As expected!"Seeing this scene, it seemed that some people were not too surprised.Just as he had guessed, Li Hao was a little different in the universe of the great path. He had turned himself into a Galaxy, which was somewhat unexpected.At this moment, the giant seemed to be looking at all the living things in the world across the great path universe.In the sky, Li Hao's voice was heard again."I've fused my body with 10000 DAOs and opened 144 meridians. I need to fix the position of the 144 stars in the world and guide the 10000 stars with my body. Everyone, listen to my command. Stir the Galaxy and gather all the DAOs to rule the world!""Everyone, listen to my orders. Activate the first aperture of the first meridian, Star River quake!"BOOM!Hundreds of millions of cultivators activated the same aperture at the same time. The sky changed color, and energy swept through the world. In one of the 360 regions, stars twinkled as a giant dragon soared above Li Hao.At this moment, the commotion was so great that it was frightening.Heaven and earth were shaking violently!Vaguely, a star was bursting with boundless light. A giant dragon Dao Meridian was crazily hitting the world as if it was going to break the universe and fall into the human world."Activate the second Meridian!"BOOM!The river rippled again. Countless people raised their heads to look at the sky. Li Hao's voice resounded through the world."Activate all 10 apertures of the first meridian, open the heaven and earth apertures, pull the heaven and earth meridians, and locate the human world!"Boom! Boom! Boom!At this moment, lightning flashed and Thunder rumbled. Tens of thousands of paths trembled and stars flickered. The commotion was so great that it was as if the end of the world had arrived.The experts seemed to have understood a little.Li Hao wanted to use the power of the people and his own Dao Meridian to penetrate the great Dao universe, lock onto the Silver Moon world, and thus affect the descent of the entire great Dao universe. It seemed very reasonable.…… In the universe of the great path, the giant dragon roared.It crazily attacked the barrier of the great path world!At this moment, the stars were the dragons, and the dragons were the stars. All the stars in the area trembled at the same time and shone with light. The power of the great Dao gathered.The Dragon roared.It crazily impacted the world!The sound of the explosion reverberated through the entire universe, creating a huge commotion.After an unknown period of time, the giant dragon seemed to have penetrated the universe. Suddenly, it burst out with an unparalleled aura and stirred the world.……In the outside world.In the sky, it was as if a giant dragon was roaring and struggling madly. Its head came out and soared in the sky. The whole world was instantly filled with the power of great DAOs, which began to spread in all directions!Li Hao's voice rang out again."The first Star is about to break out of the world ... Everyone, gather the power of the great Dao again. Repeat this. The 144 stars will enter the human world, and the Silver Moon will descend with the great Dao universe!"As he spoke, the sky turned upside down, the Dragon struggled, and the sky turned blood red.It was as if countless Thunderbolts were gathering!A giant dragon gradually turned into a huge star. It gathered the power of the great path and hung in the sky. It shook violently and was barely visible.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly appeared in the air.He reached out and grabbed, and countless energies gathered. The next moment, with a low shout, his sword cut through the sky as if it was tearing the universe apart. He reached out and grabbed a giant dragon's tail. With a fierce shout, Li Hao forcefully combined everything.BOOM!At this moment, a huge star began to appear in the sky, and sword intent overflowed. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  "First Star, complete!"Boom! Boom! Boom!The stars flickered with boundless sword intent, covering the sky and the earth. Some people nearby could feel the endless energy, which was unbelievably huge.,m "Five main cities, unite as one in the daomerge. Seal off the area and stabilize the world!"Li Hao's voice rang out again. The Dao integration stage Saints did not dare to delay. They quickly unleashed their powerful forces to maintain the light rings around the main city and suppress the world. They could not tell exactly what was going on, but ... They did not know, but they felt that it was formidable!He could vaguely understand a little, but there were some doubts that could not be explained. For example, did he have to set 144 stars?Or could it be that he could directly descend, but the price was higher?He didn't quite understand!If he didn't understand, he just had to follow the order. At this moment, everyone in the world was Li Hao's chess piece.……At the same time.Li Hao was also secretly changing the sun. The stars in the sky flickered with sword intent. They were not stars of the great path, but stars of sword intent. However, the two were very similar, and the difference was not too great.Moreover, there was a small opening on the star, through which countless power of the great path poured in. In fact, there was indeed an opening of the great path here.It wasn't completely fake!A sword Dao star alone could not burst out with such dense power of a great Dao.

Chapter 2374 The Reappearance Of Time (2)
Star positioning?There was no need for that.What Li Hao had to do was to release all his 100 sword stars and cover his spirit sea. It had to be too loud or too small, which would be easily discovered. He also needed a real connection between his spirit sea and the universe.Otherwise ... How could it attract the stars of time here?……At this moment, countless people were watching.Zheng Yu was watching, Ying Hongyue was watching, the man with the sword on his back was watching, and many others were watching silently. They looked up at the sky and saw that star that was like a sword radiating the world. Sword intent was overflowing, and the power of the great path permeated the air. They were all somewhat solemn.Could he really pull the entire great Dao universe down?This seemed to be just the beginning.……A star appeared, and Li Hao commanded the world again.The second Meridian also began to stir. The two li Haos, one in the Silver Moon and the other in the Dao universe, seemed to be working together to penetrate the universe, but in fact, they were truly penetrating the Dao universe!Apart from the last step of condensing the star, which was replaced by the world of the spirit sea, the other steps were all true!Nine truths and one lie!The most crucial and most important step was fake.In this way, even someone as powerful as Zheng Yu and the others would not be able to tell if it was real or fake if they did not personally observe and comprehend it. Moreover, the sword star was also a Dao Meridian, just that it was somewhat like an empty Meridian.Li Hao believed that even Zheng Yu wouldn't be able to tell that li daoheng had replaced his corporeal meridians with his void meridians and solidified them with sword intent unless li daoheng's actual body appeared.He naturally knew that everyone in the world was watching such a huge commotion.The entire world seemed to be enveloped by the power of a great Dao.The five large cities had also formed a barrier to seal off the Silver Moon.……Li Dynasty.The God of beginner martial was also observing. After watching for a while, he vaguely felt that something was wrong, but he couldn't tell exactly where it was.He didn't know enough about the new Dao.The king of Dali and Jiang Li could only watch in a daze and did not notice anything wrong.The Dali King racked his brains and said with a headache,""Is there a trap? Could it be that he would be killed by Li Hao's Galaxy after entering the universe of the great path? Otherwise, where would the trap be?"Li Hao almost said,"I've set a trap this time. I'm going to trick you!"But ... Now that he had put on a show, no one could see what was wrong. In any case, the king of Dali really did not see anything wrong. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  He said and then asked in confusion,""Could it be ... That it's not a trap? Li Hao is trying to scare us on purpose. He's using this opportunity to scare us so that we won't dare to act rashly. This guy is about to advance again. Senior, do you think this is possible?" Did I?The God of beginner martial thought about it, and maybe there was.He didn't say anything, as it wasn't good to be certain of this. He looked up again at the star that was shining with the true meaning of the sword and muttered,""A star as a sword ... Sword intent is flourishing, and the power of the great path is sweeping ... From this, it does match the characteristics of a star of the great path. Is there a problem with this star?""There's no hurry, let's wait and see!"He said quickly, raising his brows.The king of Dali did not say anything.I'll just continue watching!Time slowly passed, and in the void, a second star appeared. It was another star of sword way. This time, the God of beginner martial looked at it for a while and didn't find anything wrong with it.Just like him, Zheng Yu and the others had also been observing the situation closely, but they didn't notice anything amiss.……However, as the stars continued to appear ...p The God of beginner martial frowned slightly.There was no problem ... But 36 stars had already appeared. According to Li Hao's division, the 36 stars should form a cycle, which should be different.But now ... There were not many changes.More than half a day had passed. By the looks of it, he might not even be able to gather 144 stars in a day.……On the moon.Yueshen's main body kept moving. Her movements weren't too big. She walked between the barriers of heaven and earth, silently sensing something.Inside the moon.The moon goddess statue said,"it should be a real great Dao star ... And it seems to run through the great Dao universe. So much great Dao power is overflowing. It doesn't seem fake!" What do you think?"The sword-carrying man didn't even raise his head. He continued to look down at the world and said softly,""Who knows if it's real or fake? anyway, even if it's fake, we won't find out easily. Otherwise, Li Hao would be a clown!"If he really wanted to scheme against you, would you believe him if he made it so fake?Yueshen didn't mind and was a little excited.""Then ... Should we attack the true path universe? Li Hao wants to gather 144 stars ... I don't think he needs so many. When he hasn't finished, we can force our way in ... We should be able to enter the Dao universe!"It would break Li Hao's control over the real Dao universe!To seize everything!The premise was that he was not weak in the Dao of truth. If he was too weak, he would probably find it difficult to control.Yueshen continued,'I'm afraid that Zheng Yu is also tempted. He's a formidable opponent!' Is Li Hao trying to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight? is he using the Dao universe as bait to let us fight Zheng Yu, while he ... Can seal the Dao universe and let us fight in it? he might not lose control of the Dao universe, right?"This guess made some sense.The sword-bearing man pondered for a moment and nodded slightly.""It's possible ... Of course, it's hard to be sure now. The only thing I'm sure of is that Li Hao gained a lot from the seal. Each of his Natal stars has condensed a different sword intent!"

Chapter 2375 The Reappearance Of Time (3)
The sword-carrying man said softly,"more than 30 different sword intents ... Li Hao is indeed a genius in sword Dao!" The longevity sword intent was actually the convergence of thousands of sword intents, which made the sword venerable famous! Although I'm still far from being as good as revered sword artist ... I've been comprehending the longevity sword intent countless times over the years, but I still can't gather all the DAOs ..."Not only was it impossible to gather 10000 DAOs, even 100 or 1000 DAOs would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens.How long had he lived?And how long had Li Hao lived?At this rate, even if he only had 30 sword essences, he would be able to comprehend 10000 sword essences in 300 years!Of course, it would only get more difficult as time went on.However, to experts, the further they advanced, the more they might comprehend.The man with the sword on his back laughed at himself,'if Li Hao didn't care about anything and the world was peaceful, would he have become a venerable sovereign in 300 years? AI!"A soft sigh!Perhaps it was the times that made Li Hao.However, to be able to comprehend so many sword essences in such a short time still made people inevitably sigh.……The stars were still gathering, appearing one by one.The power of great DAOs began to fill the sky and earth, mixed with sword intent. Some swordsmen felt that this was a great opportunity. On the whole, Li Hao's sword intent was not as good as Supreme Sword 's, or even li daoheng' s.However, he had deep comprehension of just one sword intent, no weaker than anyone else!At this moment, all the swordsmen seemed to have entered the ocean of swordsmanship. The joy in their eyes was indescribable.There were many swordsmen in Silver Moon province.At this moment, streams of sword intent emerged from the bodies of many people. They were extremely excited. This was simply a heaven for swordsmen.They weren't the only ones.Swordsmen like the sky-connecting sword and the light sword were also silently comprehending at this moment. It was too much for their eyes to take in, and they felt that they had lived all their years in vain. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  There was a time when Li Hao still needed their guidance.But now, Li Hao had actually comprehended so many sword essences.Tian Jian and the others felt it more deeply than the others because they could find the sword essence they cultivated in the sword essence. It was so familiar, yet so strange!In heaven battling city, Tian Jian and the others had a complicated feeling, but they had also gained a lot.They were in the center of the world, and the stars were not far from them.The power of countless great DAOs swept toward him, and Tian Jian could vaguely sense that this was where his opportunity to reach Dao integration lay!Perhaps he would be able to use this opportunity to reach the Dao integration stage.This was what the swordsmen felt.This time, they had comprehended so many sword essences, so they had a high chance of advancing.,m ……40,50,60 ...The number of stars increased one by one.The universe of the great path seemed to be about to descend at any moment. A sense of oppression was suffocating.These stars seemed to form a sword in the sky.It was as if it would slash down at any moment!A day passed, and the sky turned dark. A total of 99 stars hung in the sky. In the next moment, an incomparably bright star suddenly appeared.The world seemed to have stopped for a moment!The appearance of the star seemed to cause the world to freeze.……Li Dynasty.The God of beginner martial's expression changed slightly and he muttered,""What a powerful sword intent, what a special sword intent ..."At this moment, the stars seemed to be revolving around this star.He could sense the uniqueness of this star.He didn't say much and continued to observe.After a while, another star appeared."Eh?"The God of beginner's martial was suddenly a little surprised. On the side, the king of Dali looked up, and his neck was a little sore. When he heard the sound, he was a little puzzled. He turned his head and looked at the God of beginner's martial. What's the matter?You've already condensed more than 100, what's there to be curious about?The God of beginner martial ignored him and continued to observe. He wasn't too sure. This 101st star ... It was obvious that the power of the great Dao was also sweeping over. However, the sword intent seemed to have dissipated a little and wasn't as strong as before!There didn't seem to be much difference.But ... Why did it feel a little out of place with the 100 pills?He observed silently.Could this be the problem?Was there a problem with the stars after the 100th?This thought appeared in his mind and he couldn't get rid of it. At this moment, his interest was piqued. He had been looking at it for a whole day and hadn't found anything unusual. This was the first time he felt something different.At least I didn't waste a day watching it!However, although there was a gap between the stars behind ... It didn't seem to be a big problem.At that moment, the stars moved, and a few even appeared in the sky above Dali.The God of beginner's martial didn't care. These things were in between half-virtual and half-real, so even if he broke one or two, it wouldn't be of much use. He wasn't interested in them.However ... He soon frowned.At this moment, the underground was a little different.A special power seemed to have seeped through the entire earth and covered it.He silently sensed it. He stepped on the ground and suddenly stomped.The ground seemed to be extremely solid!At this moment, the whole world changed again. A River ran through the sky and the earth, and Li Hao's voice resounded."I will use the river of chaos to wash the world and the mortal world, so that the Silver Moon can merge with the great Dao universe more easily ... Everyone, don't move, in case you are washed by the river of chaos ..."The ocean roared!The sound of monstrous waves rang out!It was as if an ocean had appeared between heaven and earth, and the sound of crashing waves crashed against heaven and earth.The God of beginner martial frowned slightly and allowed the waves to sweep across the world. They were half illusory and half real, but they didn't really wash him. Seeing that no one was paying attention, he suddenly reached out his hand as if he was a thief.

Chapter 2376 The Reappearance Of Time (3)
His hand grabbed into the void, and in a half-illusory state, his hand seemed to reach into another space-time.The next moment, he reached out his palm.In his hand, there was a drop of water that was slowly dissipating.His eyes flickered. Suddenly, he put the drop of water into his mouth and tasted it silently. Some thoughts flashed in his mind."It feels like ... Sword intent is gathering ... There's also some will, sword intent, and many other energies. It seems ... There's also some ... Special energy mixed in?"An ocean of ten thousand DAOs?It didn't seem like it. There didn't seem to be that many DAOs. It might have something to do with the fact that Li Hao didn't master that many DAOs.The sword essence was extremely rich!Apart from that, there was also a ... Special smell. That smell was somewhat familiar.Thinking of the fluctuations in the earth, his eyes moved slightly."The smell of stone slag ... Strange ... Earth sword intent?"It was wrong!It was still not right. On the whole, it had the taste of the longevity sword will of the sword venerable.He reached out again and grabbed a drop of liquid.Suddenly, he seemed to have sensed something, and his expression changed slightly. Eh ... There was also a ... A smell of withered trees coming back to spring.Rocks, trees ...At that moment, the God of beginner martial seemed to have sensed something. At that moment, a long river ran through the void as if it came from the end of the world, and a shadow appeared not far away.The Dali King's face changed!The God of beginner martial's expression also changed slightly, as if he was a little embarrassed. Before the shadow could speak, he coughed.""The king of Dali is insensible. You do what you want, and it has nothing to do with us. We don't care what you do!"The king of Dali was puzzled. He turned his head and looked at her. What did I do?As for Li Hao's Phantom, he only glanced at him silently.He sensed that someone had taken some of his spiritual ocean water. The first time was fine, as it was probably done by the God of beginner martial. He didn't care, but there was a second time!If he didn't do anything, he was worried that this person would cut off his spiritual sea!The king of Dali had barely entered the Heavenly King level ... How could he have the ability to intercept his spiritual ocean!However, since this person had already said so, Li Hao couldn't say anything more.The voice carried the sound of the great Dao."King of Dali, don't do this kind of thing again. If you want to observe, you'll be able to observe clearly sooner or later. My enemy is not you. If you ruin my business, king of Dali ... You and I will completely fall out!"The Dali King was innocent!F * ck!What did I do?I didn't do anything!He wanted to defend himself, but the God of beginner martial coughed lightly.""Young friend, you can go and do what you need to do. The king of Dali is too young and insensible. I will discipline him!""Then I'll have to trouble senior!"Li Hao was also very polite. He stood far away and didn't get close. The river once again pierced through the sky and disappeared.The king of Dali opened his mouth to speak, but Jiang Li gave him a look.King, shut up! Can't you tell?These two ... Had reached a tacit understanding and did not wish to have any conflicts with each other. Clearly, Li Hao was not satisfied with what the God of beginner martial had done, so he had crossed the world and come here.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The God of beginner's martial arts is letting you take the blame!The king of Dali was not really stupid ... At this moment, he also felt the inside story ... And could not help but curse!How unlucky!……At the same time.Li Hao's shadow seemed to be everywhere. Li Hao's shadow appeared in front of the experts.Li Hao's voice was calm as he looked at the experts.""I have no intention of competing with you. Today, I'm just trying to increase the strength of my people ... I hope you won't cause any destruction!"In Hurricane city.Zheng Yu looked at The Phantom in front of him. A special force went around Hurricane city and did not cover it. Even the stars in the sky were some distance away from Hurricane city.He looked at Li Hao's shadow and smiled.""Li Hao, are you playing hard to get? You ... Are you expecting us to cause some destruction?"Li Hao smiled and said,"Zheng Yu, if you want to think this way, then just take it that you are!" However, I still have to warn you ... Don't disturb me. Otherwise, don't blame me for not warning you when the seal is broken! If you dare to enter my great Dao universe, I'll dare to seal the universe. Even if it's only for a moment ... It's enough for me to kill Ying Hongyue and break the seal!"Zheng Yu smiled and did not say anything.Li Hao ... Was he threatening her, or was he playing hard to get?He was such a complicated person!After suffering a few losses, he wasn't sure.Seeing that Li Hao was about to leave, he suddenly said,"Some of the stars in the sky don't seem right. Li Hao, is this a flaw that you deliberately left behind, or ... Are there really problems with these stars?""Senior is overthinking!"Li Hao left.Zheng Yu didn't say anything. Beside him, the Queen looked up at the sky. Something was wrong with the stars?Could it be ... The trap was here?"Senior Zheng ... Did he intentionally lure you into attacking?"“……”Zheng Yu couldn't be bothered.The Queen then said,"why don't we just defend Hurricane city?" This King feels that as long as we remain unmoved, Li Hao's schemes won't be realized!"There was no problem with this.The truth was as such.As long as he remained unmoved, Li Hao couldn't touch a half-step Emperor. Otherwise, he would have come long ago and let you scheme against him. What could you do if I didn't move?But ...Zheng Yu looked at the sky silently. At this moment, he could really vaguely see a universe descending. The universe of the great path was really about to descend. He had already felt it. The entire Silver Moon was enveloped by a special fluctuation.

Chapter 2377 The Reappearance Of Time (3)
This was ... A universe of Dao!Can I give up?If I give up, will li daoheng give up?One peach killed three warriors?Using the great Dao universe as bait to let me fight with li daoheng?……On the other side.Ying Hongyue suddenly scuttled away.Li Hao's shadow appeared. Looking in the direction he fled, he said softly,""Ying Hongyue, don't give me any trouble! Otherwise, even if I can't kill you, I'll embarrass you. Don't ask for trouble!"The fleeing Ying Hongyue turned her head and glanced at Li Hao. Her eyes flickered slightly, and a gentle smile appeared on her face again. However, there was a gloominess in her eyes that she didn't have in the past. She chuckled,"Li Hao, I'm not the one you want to deal with! You and I are both pitiful people. We aren't the rulers of this world, so there's no need to keep targeting me ... Whether you're scheming against two half-step sovereigns or heaven's will today ... It has nothing to do with me, so I naturally won't interfere. I don't think you really want the seal to be broken. After a few times, the seal has become extremely weak. If your people continue to target me, I'm afraid I can't hold on any longer ... You'll be in more pain than me if I release the venerable sovereign!"Li Hao ignored him and instantly disappeared.Ying Hongyue let out a breath and sneered.p Beside him, the flying sword immortal frowned,'I can sense his evil intentions! I'm afraid he really wants to kill you ...""It's normal. ""Of course he wants to kill me," Ying Hongyue said calmly. "If I wasn't connected to the seal, do you really think he wouldn't be able to kill me?" He might have said that he was formidable and that he could easily destroy the seal and perish together with the other party ... But in reality, he was incomparably fearful. He, Zheng Yu, and the others were all aware of this! Otherwise ... The seal would have been broken long ago. Li Hao still has his own plans. He won't give up and really break the seal unless there's no hope at all!"Flying sword immortal was silent for a moment."Then this time, he took such a risk. If the two half-step sovereigns really seized his Dao universe, would he disregard everything and kill you by force?"Ying Hongyue pondered for a moment and nodded. This was also a possibility.However, Li Hao's trap ... Might give him a chance of victory. However, it was necessary to be careful.……All over the world, the stars twinkled.The water of the long river continuously washed over the world. The ocean of spirit seemed to cover the entire universe.At this moment, the number of stars in the sky increased.The stars embellished the world, adding a few more spectacular and beautiful colors.At this moment, Li Hao's voice resounded through the Silver Moon.""The stars are about to finish gathering. Soon, I will summon the entire Dao universe! This time, heaven and earth will become a Holy Land for cultivation!"……At this moment, countless people held their breath and focused.It was fast!In the universe of the great path, a huge long river ran through heaven and earth and appeared above heaven battling city. At this moment, billions of stars were shining.Li Hao's clone and main body instantly became one.Li Hao was the only one left in the world.At this moment, Li Hao shouted in a low voice,"everyone, cultivate! Pull the great Dao! The great Dao ... Will merge with the heaven and earth!"BOOM! Hundreds of millions of people were cultivating at full force. In the sky above Li Hao, countless stars were shining brilliantly!At this moment, a universe seemed to have completely descended into the human world.Hualalalala ...The sound of the long river flowing filled the air, and the power of the great path permeated the world.At this moment, many stars appeared in the sky. Some were extremely bright, some were dark, some seemed real, and some seemed illusionary ...Time passed by slowly, and it seemed as if the universe was about to completely descend and merge.However, be it Hurricane city or the moon in the sky, there was no movement at all.Were they not going to make a move?This thought appeared in the minds of countless people, and they were all extremely nervous. Even Zhang an, who was in the star River City, was also slightly nervous. Was Zheng Yu not going to make a move?That's strange!Or ... Did he feel that there was a problem and was unwilling to help?Was Li Hao planning something?Just as he was thinking about all this, suddenly, the stars twinkled.At this moment, a gargantuan dog suddenly appeared between heaven and earth. It turned into a golden dog and devoured the power of the great DAOs between heaven and earth!This wasn't enough. The dog suddenly exploded with the power of 10000 DAOs!Zhang an's expression suddenly changed. He cursed in his heart. No... My book of Dao!Bastard!Illusionary images suddenly appeared on The Golden Dog's body and were instantly devoured by it. Those were clearly his books of Dao. Bastard!Zhang an was furious!How could Li Hao Do this?Shadows that seemed to penetrate the world were devoured by the big dog and fused into its body. The Black Panther let out a long roar and suddenly burst out with an even more powerful devouring power that devoured the universe and the stars in the sky!At this moment, Zheng Yu and the rest held their breath and watched silently. What was he playing at this time?  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  This was not enough!At this moment, an Emperor Palace appeared in the sky. The huge dog opened its mouth and swallowed the Emperor Palace."Roar!"The big golden dog burst out with great power, but Li Hao frowned.It was useless!The time star did not appear!This was the most crucial step. Time and Stars did not appear ... The entire world still seemed to be a little fake. Zheng Yu and the others did not make a move, and it must have something to do with this little bit of fake.They were not ignorant people like the king of Dali.At this moment, although the world looked magnificent ... It always made people feel that it was lacking something. Just this thing was enough for the two half-emperors to continue waiting!

Chapter 2378 The Reappearance Of Time (3)
He had to let Time and Stars appear. Otherwise, the descent of the great Dao universe would lose some of its mysteries.Not enough?The enormous black Panther roared crazily and looked at Li Hao.No!The star did not appear.Obviously, such a small trick could not arouse the curiosity of the stars at all.Li Hao took a deep breath. It seemed that ... He could only try it himself.He didn't say anything else and floated in the air. Suddenly, a long river flowed, and the sound of water became louder!At this moment, the stars in the sky were gathered by Li Hao. Among them, the core star of the hundred-path sword, the smaller time star, was swallowed by Li Hao.The entire river of chaos began to change.Li Hao didn't know if it would work.At this moment, he hovered between heaven and earth and said softly,""I have the past and the future. I capture the past and the future ... Time ... Is boundless!"In an instant, the world spun!Countless people looked at Li Hao. Zheng Yu and the others widened their eyes. What was Li Hao up to?At this moment, a River turned transparent and seemed to penetrate through the universe's time and space!Li Hao shouted angrily!"I have a past that I will never forget!"Boom! Boom! Boom!An illusionary shadow seemed to have emerged above the river. Time was reversed, and heaven and earth were reversed. An illusionary Li Hao appeared above the river.Li Hao roared, and the power of time instantly emerged!The illusionary Li Hao instantly closed the distance between himself and Li Hao. With a low shout, a long sword appeared."I will use the firmament sword to carry the past and fuse with my present. No past, no future!"BOOM!The firmament sword instantly merged with the void and guided the shadow toward Li Hao. In an instant, both Zheng Yu and the man carrying the sword widened their eyes in shock.BOOM!At this moment, the entire Dao universe seemed to have changed, and the sound of flowing rivers shook the entire world.A long river appeared in the eyes of countless people.The river seemed to run through the past and the future!At this moment, the shadow took on Li Hao's appearance. It was actually Li Hao. The two li Haos, connected by the firmament sword, suddenly walked together and fused with each other. Li Hao's aura suddenly became much stronger!Zheng Yu's expression changed drastically!What was this?At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have reached the fifth level of Dao integration from the fourth level!"I will use the chaos River to guide the future self! The future ... Will merge with my present!"In an instant, he seemed to have jumped out of the world. At the end of the world, a long river ran through. A powerful existence seemed to be separated from time and space. It was overbearing and powerful as it walked step by step from the end of the world!That was also a Li Hao!He seemed to have experienced the vicissitudes of life, and every step he took seemed to be a little sluggish. However, his aura was monstrous!At this moment, a star suddenly appeared in the universe of the great path.At this moment, it seemed to be filled with curiosity and doubt as it flew over from the depths of the universe. As soon as the star appeared, the world instantly trembled and the entire world seemed to have quieted down.In the northern Li Dynasty.The God of beginner's martial was stunned. He looked at the faintly discernible stars and fell into a daze. Soon, a divine light appeared in his eyes!At this moment, he moved his feet as if he was going to break through the air!His eyes were filled with shock and desire!This was something that had never happened before!What was this?What kind of Natal star was this?This seemed to be ... Shi Guang!Li Hao had mastered time! He had actually mastered time, he had actually guided the past and future!At this moment, even someone as calm as him couldn't sit still. He wanted to rush up and take a look, or even ... Capture this star.……Hurricane city.The moment Li Hao guided the past and future, Zheng Yu couldn't sit still anymore. He was astonished, and when the star appeared, the Heavenly Kings in the city seemed to freeze for a moment. He couldn't suppress it anymore.At this moment, was the trap ... Important?The star of time!Guiding the past and future, controlling time!He instantly woke the Queen up and shouted in her mind,""Charge out!" Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The Queen did not dare to delay. At this moment, Zheng Yu looked as if he was going to kill someone. She was shocked.A bright moon instantly appeared, and she soared into the sky. However, before she could go far, she seemed to be covered by the star and froze again. Zheng Yu was suspended in the moon, not shocked but delighted!It really ... Could freeze time. Even a Heavenly King like the Queen could be frozen!"Charge!" He shouted again.The Queen sobered up again, a little dazed, and rushed into the air again.In the sky, another bright moon began to shine. The sword-carrying man's eyes lit up and he also shouted,""Wake up, quickly!"The moon goddess statue was sometimes awake and sometimes in a trance.At this moment, he didn't care about anything else and rushed towards the place where the stars gathered.There, a half-real and half-illusionary star was carefully approaching two li Haos ... At this moment, the whole world seemed to be frozen. Except for a few experts, everyone else was frozen!The God of beginner martial flew straight into the sky. The next moment, his expression changed slightly. He looked into the distance, gritted his teeth, and turned back.No!That's not my mission!I won't get involved!Nothing good would come out of getting involved!Especially for such a crucial thing ... He was just a clone, so he couldn't get involved. He couldn't get involved ...After continuously convincing himself in his heart, he turned around and ran!I want to go back to sleep!I can't look anymore!'I'm going to be tempted soon. I've been holding it in for 100000 years, but it hasn't moved at all. I can't be tempted now!'He thought to himself while sighing in shock.' Is that Shi Guang?'The new Dao ... Actually used time as its core?Didn't that mean that its potential was even greater than the origin?……In the air, Li Hao just looked at his future self in a daze ... Was this really his future self?It seemed very weak, but it also seemed to be infinitely powerful, and it also seemed to have experienced countless battles ...That face was filled with killing intent and seemed to be a little crazy.'Is this ... Me?At this moment, he was a little dazed. He didn't even care about the two moons that were rushing over. He just looked at the future self that seemed to be one step away, but also infinitely far away.Until the next moment, a star blocked the space between the two.Li Hao instantly realized!The time star ... Had appeared!As for the time star, it seemed to be curious too. It instantly pierced through the void and approached the future Li Hao, wondering what that was.From both sides, two huge moons flew over! Two half-step sovereigns 'auras swept across the world!The man with the sword and Zheng Yu looked at each other across the air. At this moment, did the trap really matter?Not important!Kill Li Hao, seize the universe, and capture this star!

Chapter 2379 One Peach Kills Three Soldiers (1)
(See at night)Zheng Yu and Li daoheng were here.Even though they knew that Li Hao had set up a trap, the two of them still came.At this point, those who didn't come were the true ruthless ones!The opportunity was right in front of them. No matter what, they had to take a gamble. Moreover, Li Hao most likely didn't have the ability to kill a pseudo-Emperor, and the most he could do was be trapped. This was the common mentality of the two top powerhouses.Two bright moons rose into the sky and headed straight for the time stars.At this moment, the sky changed color, and the universe rotated. In the sky, countless stars emitted powerful sword intent, and sword light pierced through the surroundings.His spirit sea whizzed past, and the entire spiritual world began to shrink.A package!The spiritual world started to wrap around them. However, it was still connected to the great Dao universe at the moment, so it was still extremely dangerous. Once the two of them sensed the problem, they would break through the firmament and head straight for the great Dao universe ... This time, the great Dao universe was very likely to be broken through by the two of them.They also knew that there was a problem!But ... At this moment, the two of them didn't care about that. They went straight for Li Hao and the space-time star. Everything else was secondary. Their goal was to kill Li Hao and take the star!Zheng Yu's calm face also revealed a hint of madness!Past, future, present!This star could actually control time and connect three reincarnations. For a half-step sovereign like him, once he controlled this star and combined his three reincarnations into one, wouldn't he be able to step into the venerable sovereign Dao?The emperor's path was right in front of him!In order to vindicate Dao and become an Emperor, any danger was no longer important.A chance!"Kill!"A low roar resounded through the starry sky. The powerful whip instantly pierced through the heavens and earth, heading straight for li daoheng. Zheng Yu wanted to stop li daoheng, but the man with the sword on his back had already slashed out without a word!The sword radiance and the whip radiance collided with each other and annihilated each other. Heaven and earth shook and the universe shattered.The two half-step sovereigns finally exchanged blows at this moment!They were testing each other out, and their hearts were all focused.He felt that the other party was stronger than he had expected!Zheng Yu's expression was grave. Seeing that the moon that the Queen had transformed into was unable to get close, he cursed the trash in his heart and immediately left the moon. He disappeared in an instant and rushed straight for the time star.Similarly, on li daoheng's side, the moon goddesses couldn't withstand the light of Time and Stars, and they fell into silence.The man with the sword on his back walked out with his sword in hand, instantly breaking through the starry sky.The two of them, one on the left and one on the right, rushed toward Li Hao at an unimaginably fast speed, where Xingchen was. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Li Hao was also their target. ……At this moment, Li Hao was dumbfounded as he looked at himself, who seemed to be in another space and time.He wanted to take a step forward and get closer to her.In the end, he realized that it was as if there was a world between them that he could not touch or touch. It was different from his past self. The past was one and the future was limitless!Li Hao knew this very well!The future was like a flower in the mirror and the moon in the water, unattainable!The past had already happened, so the past could be captured. The future, on the other hand, had countless possibilities. Any change could change the future.Therefore, the future self in front of him was particularly illusory.Perhaps, in the next moment, Li Hao's casual action could change everything in the future. The Li Hao in front of them might become another future, or even no future!Therefore, he couldn't touch it. Even if he used the chaos River to pierce through it, it was as if he had pierced through the universe. He couldn't touch the future self that was not far away.The future ... Was irreconcilable!As for the Time and Stars, they seemed to have touched the future. At this moment, they were still there, curious and puzzled. It was as if they were asking,"how did this thing appear?"Of course, Li Hao had only borrowed some of the power of time when the time star had such an ability.This was an illusory future!Just as the two great experts were about to attack, Li Hao, seeing that his future self couldn't merge, was about to retreat into the Dao universe. Suddenly, the illusory Li Hao looked at Li Hao and then at the stars.He seemed to know something.With a strange look in his eyes, he sighed softly. This sigh resounded through the world and resounded through people's hearts. His voice actually sounded in Li Hao's ears with a hint of helplessness."I knew it, there's always a gain for every loss!"Li Hao was shocked!"You're borrowing the future, and I'm ... Fighting! In this instant, you seduced my power, and in the future, you will have to repay it ... Do you understand what I mean?"Li Hao was greatly shocked! I understand!At this moment, he was summoning his future self, and his future self was borrowing power from the other party while he was fighting ... At this moment, his power was suddenly borrowed by him ... This meant that the other party ... Or rather, his future self, would lose his power at a critical moment and be killed by the enemy!Sure enough, at this moment, the future self suddenly became illusory and became more and more illusory. He sighed,""It's a matter of life and death ... This is only one possibility in the future. However, the current you will face a crisis at some point in the future. You will lose your strength instantly to fill this gap!""The future of my time and space ... I've already been killed by the enemy ... I hope you won't end up like me ... Be careful of a certain danger in the future!"Li Hao was shocked!If this was a kind of future, he would kill his future self because he randomly summoned his future self!At this moment, Li Hao crossed the stars with one step, as if he had come from the boundless future.
