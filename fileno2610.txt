"A new emperor and King have been born in more than 50 years ... Senior, do you think there's anything special about this new king?"They were just venerable sovereigns, and there was no lack of neo martial arts.The key was whether there was something special about this new king. Otherwise, what was a venerable sovereign of a small world?Even he, King Huai, would not be afraid."There must be something special!"Although Heaven's Fate wasn't too sure, he still made a judgment at this moment."Not only is he special, but he should be easy to talk to. He shouldn't have much hostility towards me, neo martial. Otherwise, how could I still be alive without my clone? It's just that time is too short. Now, they've even broken through the Stargate and entered the chaos ... The Silver Moon is too weak, and I'm worried that they're too weak. Now that the Crimson Moon world and my new martial are fighting each other, the direction they're heading in ... Is probably the rumored tianfang world!"It's too chaotic over there!It wasn't just chaos. Most importantly, the experts in the tianfang world were all like a group of chaos bandits. They weren't good people.Seeing the opportunity, these people were more terrifying than locusts!It was simply a Bandit's lair!Once the new king of Silver Moon entered ... It could be a huge problem. More importantly, once the identity of the new king of Silver Moon was exposed ... It involved new martial arts, which was extremely dangerous!King Huai pondered for a while and sent another message,"That is to say ... If this person has inherited even a little of the neo martial arts style, he is likely to go to the tianfang world and cause some big trouble in the tianfang realm?""Right!"The two of them looked at each other helplessly.Yes, even if he inherited a little of the neo martial arts style, this person might go to the tianfang world, and ... He would cause big trouble. This was inevitable.Even if the two of them managed to survive the crisis, it would be difficult for them to escape when they reached the tianfang world.It was really sad!Despite knowing this, the two of them did not dare to not go. They could only pray that the new king from the Silver Moon, it would be best ... It would be best if he was like the human King and did not know the way. It would be even better if he got lost in chaos.He didn't go straight for Tian Fang!Sometimes, they were also envious of the human King's bad habit. He could walk around freely. If he got lost, so be it. In any case, he was strong and fearless. Wherever he went, there were opportunities. What was there to be afraid of?At this moment, he could only hope that this new king would not be like the human King, a source of disaster that would randomly find trouble.Otherwise ... If they really found it, they wouldn't be able to withstand it either!"It's fine. It'll take one or two years to get there ..."At this moment, Heaven's Fate consoled himself. It was still early anyway. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It's best if ... There's movement over there as well. Go a little further. I'll continue to chase, and you continue to run. The later we meet, the better the result.……At this moment, Li Hao already knew that the two neo martial Supreme emperors were coming to the Silvermoon world. His thoughts were ... It would be best to meet these two as soon as possible.Not for anything else, but because these two were in danger.In any case, he was here to find Silver Moon ... If he were to die while searching, wouldn't he feel embarrassed?At this moment, Li Hao felt a little anxious.He was actually not in too much of a hurry when he walked out of Silver Moon.Slowly!There was no rush in cultivation.He didn't really like plundering methods. In the past, he didn't really care about it, but later on, he realized that although plundering was fast, it wasn't as fast as comprehending Dao. One had short-term results, while the other had long-term results.But at this moment, he was thinking, should he take both paths?As for murder and arson ... Li Hao didn't mind. He had killed countless people, so why would he care?Just like that Supreme Emperor Yunyang who took the initiative to find trouble with me, and we're enemies to begin with ... It's better to just kill this kind of person. There won't be so much trouble to speak of."Giant pincer, are there only three open Taoist connotation sites in the entire Hui Long Yu?""Right!""Yes!" The giant pincer nodded."The returning Dragon region is the largest region in the southern region. Including the returning Dragon Temple, it has four Taoist connotation lands, which is the most. The other nine regions usually only have one, which is occupied by the major forces. The southern region only has 13 Taoist connotation lands in total!""There are about 50 Taoist connotation in the entire tianfang world ... Not all of them were left behind by high-level venerable sovereigns. There aren't that many high-level venerable sovereigns either. Even at the peak of tianfang world, there weren't that many high-level venerable sovereigns!""Many of the Taoist connotation places were only left behind by middle-stage venerable sovereigns ..."About 50 spots.Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. If all 50 places were the same as this time, he would gain something ... Listening to the teachings of dozens of venerable sovereigns, the weakest of which was at the intermediate level, while the strongest was at the advanced level, the gains would be enormous!Of course, many of them were occupied by other forces.The three places that were made public in the Dragon field had only lost their Taoist connotation and could hardly be presented. That was why they had made it public. It was also an explanation to the foreign venerable sovereigns to avoid a huge conflict."By the way, do you know where the third stage venerable sovereign is in the Yunyang world?"“……”The giant pincer was shocked, but of course, it didn't show it on its face."I know a little ... They've been in contact with a medium fourth level venerable sovereign recently. They seem to be discussing something. I don't know the details, but it might be related to neo martial!""Can you ask me out for a private meeting? It's best if it's outside the tianfang world. " 艹!Are you preparing to kill the other party?

Chapter 2611 You Can't Even Keep A Low Profile (Happy New Year)_3
How terrifying!A third stage venerable sovereign!His guess ... Could it be true?The giant pincer had a slight headache and quickly transmitted a message,""Senior, a third rank venerable sovereign is a big target. Many people are paying attention to him ..."The meaning of his words was nothing more than hoping for less trouble.What a headache!Li Hao pondered. It made sense. Tier 3 players were hard to kill. He had to ask Black Panther and the others to help him. It would cause a huge commotion. He might as well think of a way and advance to Tier 2 first.Li Hao actually had some ideas about his own advancement to level two venerable sovereign.Life and death were the main, and the myriad DAOs were secondary.He needed some conditions before he could advance to rank two. It was not too difficult. He needed a large amount of Qi of life and death. Qi of life was easy to find, but Qi of death ... He needed to kill a few venerable sovereigns to gather all of them.Of course, under normal circumstances, there was no need to do so.Otherwise, killing a few venerable sovereigns every time he advanced ... All the venerable sovereigns in the world would be dead.However, for the sake of speed, this was the best way.In addition, he also needed a large number of great Dao crystals. Killing one previously ... Was too little.Of course, even if he killed, he couldn't kill randomly.He had to find the right person.If they weren't bad people or enemies, such as Yunyang, they could be killed.Also ... I heard that there were venerable sovereigns in the dark World and the Elysian world. New martial's enemy ... Even if Li Hao did not admit it, he was still his enemy. When people took revenge on new martial, they would not care whether Silver Moon and new martial were of the same mind or not.Look, even if Red Moon were to issue a wanted order, Silver Moon would still be able to fetch a high price!"Are there any venerable sovereigns nearby in the dark World and the Elysian world?"The giant pincer was once again shocked!What was going on?This person ... Could he be a neo martial artist human King?If ...He was so scared that he peed his pants.Otherwise, why would he ask about the two major worlds?"Don't worry, it has nothing to do with you. You're just a Heavenly King!"He said.The giant pincer was on the verge of tears when Li Hao said that.F * ck!He was really a neo martial artist!There was no other reason. The chaos was so big that the names below venerable sovereign were actually very chaotic. The title of Heavenly King was actually exclusive to neo martial artists. One World, one name, even if it was a spiritual voice transmission, the meaning was here. A Heavenly King!According to tianfang world, he wasn't a Heavenly King.Damn it!This is troublesome!He had many thoughts in his mind. At this moment, he was really frightened. If the person in front of him was a neo martial King ... He was a top-tier seventh-grade powerhouse. It was even said that when he merged with Emperor Cang, he would have eighth-grade power!This was a true top-notch venerable sovereign. Without three or five major cosmos absolute beings ... They wouldn't be able to defeat him!However, in such a huge place like Tian Fang, there were no level Seven venerable sovereigns.Countless thoughts appeared in his mind again, and the giant pincer's smile was uglier than crying."Senior is right. The giant pincer understands and will definitely not speak nonsense!"Li Hao had intimidated him time and time again.The giant pincer also knew that it still had some uses for it. Otherwise, a cultivator below venerable sovereign would have been killed in one breath by these people!"There are several venerable sovereigns from both The Dark World and the Elysian world in the Outlander world. Currently, each of them has a rank five venerable sovereign leading them ... It's because of this that the four major forces of the Outlander world are trying to rope both sides in!""These people didn't go to other macro worlds because they're worried that they'll be devoured by the Lords of other macro worlds ... On the other hand, Hui long temple and the others aren't macro worlds, and they have level six cultivators, which is in line with their expectations. Therefore, they've been communicating with each other recently!""There are many venerable sovereigns in the great world. I don't know exactly how many venerable sovereigns are still alive on both sides, but there are no less than ten in total! Back in the Dragon field, there are several venerable sovereigns here, and they have some contact with the Huilong temple. "Li Hao nodded. That was quite a lot.Moreover, there was a fifth stage venerable sovereign in charge. This was not weak. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Are there any venerable sovereigns in neo martial arts who come to tianfang world?""Not at the moment."The giant pincer explained,"the neo martial Supreme Emperor is mainly active near the Crimson Moon region. The Crimson Moon region is also very large. There are more than ten great worlds there. In fact, it is not less than the tianfang region. Now that two great worlds have been destroyed, there are still many ...""What are the various powers in tianfang world thinking?""Thoughts ..."The giant pincer was helpless. How would I know?"They probably ... Have a few thoughts. First, they want to find a great Dao universe. Second, tianfang world. Although there was no great path universe, it was said that there was the origin of the tianfang great path here. In other words, if someone could advance to seventh level venerable sovereign here without the support of the great path universe ... A new great path universe might be born! He will unify the tianfang world and become the true Overlord of the world!"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. No wonder so many Level 6 venerable sovereigns were gathered here.This meant that ... If he advanced to Level Seven here, there was hope of a new Dao universe being born?It was not impossible!Even if the Dao universe had been taken away, the native world was still somewhat connected to the Dao universe. Once something was activated, perhaps another Dao universe could really be born.This world was much more powerful than the average great world.Controlling Tian Fang, even if he was still at the seventh step, was considered a top existence among the seventh step.However, if these people knew about this, there was no reason for the great world not to know. The Dragon returning temple and the other forces might have some connections with some great worlds, or even ... They might be the other party's people.Otherwise, how could there be a Type 6 world-less rogue cultivator!Without the support of anyone behind the scenes, it was almost impossible for a venerable sovereign who didn't walk the Dao universe to reach level six.

Chapter 2612 You Can't Even Keep A Low Profile (Happy New Year)_4
Li Hao kept analyzing the situation, hoping to find some information that was beneficial to him.At this moment, they soon arrived at the second Taoist connotation.Fire element mountain.It was a place of Taoist connotation left behind by a fire-elemental venerable sovereign. It was said that in the past, the fire-elemental Taoist connotation would often erupt here, but later on, it was gradually extinguished. The flaming Mountain here no longer erupted.This also meant that his Taoist connotation had been exhausted.Now, it had become a tourist spot. There were also venerable sovereigns looking for opportunities here, but fewer and fewer people came.The fire element mountain also occupied a large territory.Li Hao sensed the fight between venerable sovereigns as soon as he arrived, but he didn't get involved. Instead, he took the giant pincers and walked in another direction to avoid trouble. At the moment, he was more concerned about whether he could comprehend some of the venerable sovereigns 'Taoist connotation.As for using the power of time continuously, it would only consume his lifespan. Second, Li Hao was actually worried about the appearance of the lightning tribulation.It would be troublesome then.Therefore, he hoped that the lightning tribulation wouldn't be born so soon.……In a land of lava within the Huoxing mountain.Li Hao activated the power of time again and concealed himself with a deathly aura, but in fact, Li Hao had already sensed that chaos might have detected him. If this went on, he would likely trigger the chaos lightning tribulation.However, the opportunity was right in front of him.After much consideration, Li Hao decided to continue. This time, the lightning tribulation might not come.……At the same time.Outside the chaos.Monastery master Hui long looked at the gathering and dispersing tribulation clouds and frowned slightly.It had just dissipated, and it came again.What had happened?Primal Chaos lightning tribulations were very rare.However, today was the second time they had gathered.Could it be that ... Something strange had really happened to Tian Fang?Could it be that Tian Fang's great Dao universe was about to appear?If a second great Dao universe was born in tianfang world, it might really attract chaos lightning tribulation!After all, it had already happened once, and doing it again would not conform to the Laws of Chaos.Is it near my return to the Dragon field? The lightning tribulation had always gathered near the southern region.And not the entire tianfang world! At this moment, there were a few more venerable sovereigns around. Almost all of them were middle-stage venerable sovereigns. There were other territory Masters and some outsiders.The commotion here was not small, and their attention was attracted.The venerable sovereigns all looked at the Tribulation clouds gathering in the chaos. Someone whispered,""So this is the primal Chaos lightning tribulation? It doesn't feel too strong ... Is it just born, or is the factor that induced the Tribulation lightning not strong enough ... So it's only a weak power?" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This kind of tribulation cloud didn't look too strong.At most, he had the power of a first or second stage venerable sovereign.To them, if the lightning tribulation attacked them, they would be able to destroy it easily.But ... Why was this born?At this moment, everyone seemed to be deep in thought. Like the Dragon returning temple Abbot, they thought of something. Could it be that ... The change in tianfang, the opportunity that they had been waiting for many years, was about to appear? was a new great Dao universe about to be born in tianfang?That would be a serious and heavenly opportunity!To them, whoever could control the new Great Dao universe would be the master of the great Dao of tianfang world. They could even become the master of the world in one fell swoop and control the entire world. At that time, even if they had not reached Level Seven and sealed off a great world, it would be as difficult as ascending to the sky for the Masters of ordinary great worlds to attack tianfang world!This was because this was a type 9 world!The world of Silvermoon was self-sealed, and even a venerable sovereign would find it difficult to break it open. After being sealed for so many years, the world itself also had powerful energy.A fourth-rank controlled the great path universe and world, and could quickly become a fifth-rank or even sixth-rank venerable sovereign. In a sealed world, even a seventh-rank would find it difficult to break through Tian Fang.At that time ... It would be like reaching the heavens in a single step!At this moment, monastery master Hui long cursed in his heart.Damn it!These guys were obviously tempted. More importantly, he was not the only level six venerable sovereign in the tianfang region. Many other worlds in the tianfang region had eyes and ears in the vicinity.The birth of a chaos lightning tribulation ... Did not seem to be a good thing for him!At this time, as if to divert their attention, a venerable sovereign suddenly said,""There seems to be some news from the Crimson Moon world. It's said that a subsidiary world of the yin-yang world might have had a chaos lightning tribulation before ... Could it be related to the Silvermoon world that a chaos lightning tribulation suddenly appeared here?"Of course, this was just a diversion.Even if a small world had given birth to a chaos lightning tribulation once, could it give birth to a second or third?Did they really think that anyone could get their hands on a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?But now, everyone was pretending to be confused, so it was better to divert their attention, lest they start fighting among themselves before the opportunity appeared.As soon as these words were spoken, The Eyes of the Dragon returning temple's Abbot flickered, and he slowly said,""It's possible! The Silvermoon world was previously an unrated world. It was said that a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation was born, and one of Red moon's venerable sovereigns died ... It's possible that some changes have occurred in the world ... And this place is not too far from the other party's original location. Red Moon has also sent word that the Silvermoon world might be moving to the Skyland world ... It seems that this is really possible. "He didn't think so before, but now, he thought about it carefully and said,""In addition, chaos lightning tribulation doesn't seem very strong. If the skyside world had brought it here, it wouldn't make any sense for it to be so weak! However, if it was the Silvermoon world, then it's possible. After all, it's just an unranked world ..."

Chapter 2613 You Can't Even Keep A Low Profile (Happy New Year)_5
These words made some sense.The crowd was just trying to divert their attention, but at this moment, they looked at each other. A fifth level venerable sovereign suddenly said coldly,""If the Silvermoon world is really nearby, then please don't fight with me! I'll destroy the entire world, destroy the Silver Moon, and kill all the living beings in the Silver Moon! Of course, I don't care about the benefits offered by the Crimson Moon world. You can take whatever you want!"No one said anything. The venerable sovereign was full of murderous intent. He was an expert from The Dark World.The Dragon return temple's Abbot had also been trying to win him over. At this moment, he smiled and said,""That's natural! I'll return to the Dragon Temple and stay behind to guard the southern region's realm gate ... If the Silver Moon world really comes here ... The world will either be devoured by the Chaos Beast or there are other factors ... No matter what, we'll investigate! In addition, we'll also send people to search the surrounding primordial chaos to see if there have been any beasts of primordial chaos appearing in the vicinity. "Without the beasts of primordial chaos, that world was almost impossible to move. Even if it could, its speed would be frighteningly slow.The venerable sovereign from The Dark World nodded slightly.""Then I'll have to trouble you to return to the venerable Dragon Emperor!""No need! The yin-yang world has been going against the law. Now, it has casually destroyed a great world and destroyed The Order of Chaos. It should be destroyed together!"As soon as he said that, some venerable sovereigns fell silent and did not respond.These words couldn't be randomly answered.The venerable Dragon Emperor must have some connections with some great worlds, so he was not afraid. However, they couldn 't. The yin-yang neo martial was not something they could provoke. Even if they had some ideas, they had to keep a low profile.On the surface, it was better to be polite.Venerable Dragon sovereign didn't say much. He ignored the Thunder tribulation and flew to the door. He reached out and grabbed a picture book. He checked it and found that four venerable sovereigns had entered the great world from the southern realm gate recently.The faces of the four experts appeared in his eyes. These four venerable sovereigns were almost all level one or two venerable sovereigns.One of them came from a macro world, and he had seen him twice. As for the other three, zu an seemed familiar as well. He had stayed here for a while in the past. Even if a venerable sovereign hadn't come for many years, he would still be able to recognize them.The remaining two were a man and a woman. The man was Li Hao.As for the female venerable sovereign, venerable Dragon Emperor took a closer look at her. There were not many female venerable sovereigns in the chaos, and he was not familiar with her. Like Li Hao, she seemed to be a newcomer.Moreover, they were all from the South.The South was the red moon region. Of course, the chaos was too vast. Other regions might also come from the South. It was possible that a new world's venerable sovereign or some hidden world's venerable sovereign had come out to train. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, based on the news from the Crimson Moon, if silver Moon really was moving here ... These two would be suspicious.Could it be the master of Silvermoon?The Silver Moon had been sealed for decades. Could it be that a new venerable sovereign had been born this time?Previously, he had not paid much attention to it. The main thing was that Silver Moon was not of much use to him, a rank six venerable sovereign, even if he were to switch to another medium-level world! However, Silver Moon was connected to neo martial ... And now, many people had ideas about neo martial, and he was no exception.With a thought, he quickly sent a message."Pay attention to the two new venerable sovereigns. Giant pincer and Hu Xin are the guides for these two, right? Pay attention and observe the situation, and report the situation at any time!"They were not familiar with Silver Moon either.He didn't know if the new master would be a man or a woman, a human or a demon, or if there were any special characteristics ... None of them were clear.Therefore, he could only observe for a while.The two first level venerable sovereigns were not too strong, but sometimes, venerable sovereigns could not be moved to avoid causing big trouble. They had to be investigated before they could be moved.……At this moment, Li Hao was still reversing time.At this moment, he once again descended into an ancient era.This time, it was different from the previous Dragon. At this moment, a red-haired human powerhouse appeared in front of him. Suddenly, the fire in his eyes dissipated and he snorted coldly,""Who has the guts to steal my Dao?"The man suddenly looked at Li Hao's area. In an instant, he seemed to have sensed something, and his eyes flickered."Time reversal?"These people seemed to be very knowledgeable. They seemed to have seen through something with a single glance, and their expressions changed slightly."Future person? A person from the past? Or something else?"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat, but he didn't dare to reply.He had felt an immense sense of danger when he had replied earlier.This time ... It was a pity that he didn't get to see the other party preach.This time, he was prepared to see if he could fight a protracted battle. The other party had to cultivate, right?Although it wasn't very suitable to pry into other people's Dao techniques ... This was the fastest shortcut for him to improve now."He peeked into my past and future, but he doesn't dare to make a sound ... Could it be that his strength is ordinary?"The man muttered to himself,"through what and where, you can spy on my Taoist body? Could it be ... That it's in Tian Fang, in my fire element divine mountain?"The man seemed to have guessed something, and he was much smarter than the Dragon. After a long time, he said in a loud voice,""The power of time ... Can not be tolerated by chaos! The sector Lord once said that life and death, yin and yang, universe, time, they were all order breaking DAOs! Destroying order, destroying the stability of chaos ... The Dao of time is difficult to find in this world. It might exist in the past or in the future ... Finding the Dao master of time in this generation is as difficult as ascending to the heavens!""You're looking for my Taoist body ... Peeking into my past and future ... What do you want?"

As he said that, he thought of something and raised his eyebrows slightly."Forget it, I can't reply. Perhaps ... My strength is really average and I've been contaminated by time by chance ... You want to pry into my Dao? It's also a good thing that I'm kind and friendly ..."Friendly?The fire element master's explosion was no ordinary one."If you're someone from the past, you're peeking into my future ... Perhaps we'll meet again soon! If you're from the future, you're peeking into my past, which means I'm still alive ..."Was he really alive?Li Hao's heart trembled. True, if he died, would he still be able to pry into his past?This meant that the heaven's side experts might really still be alive."We'll meet again one day. You've peeked into the Dao of the heavens, and the cycle of karma. However much you've gained today, perhaps ... You'll have to pay ten times, or even a hundred times, the price in the future! Don't stir up trouble just because you have a rough understanding of time ... You have to understand that the Dao of karma is also extremely terrifying!""Every time you peek into the past and future, you have to pay a huge price ... No matter where you are, no matter when and where you are, you can't escape ... Since that's the case, I'll explain the Dao of fire to you. I don't know if it's what you want!" At this moment, Li Hao was shocked.Karma?Perhaps ... It really existed.He had peeked into neo martial's past and had come into contact with Supreme martial artists and human Kings. Although he had not paid the price yet, he knew that he owed them a favor. For his sake, the other party had destroyed two great worlds.As for Li Hao ... He might have to pay a huge price in the future.It could even be said that from this moment on, he had already begun to pay off the debts of neo martial. He was eager to improve and hoped to advance quickly to stop Heaven's Fate and King Huai from being killed.And this was just the beginning.Otherwise, why would Li Hao Do this when the Silver Moon appeared and he didn't have to go on a trip?He could totally ignore it!What does it have to do with me?  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ But now, he couldn 't.He owed neo martial arts a favor.Regardless of whether the human King and the Supreme martial artist had destroyed the great world by chance or if they had really done it for him, regardless of the reasons, if it had not been for the big commotion caused by new martial, Silver Moon might not have had the chance to leave that place at all and would have been annihilated by the Crimson Moon world.Today, the path master of the fire path was reminding him that he had only accepted a few of his mantras, and they were only superficial ones. To him, the future might not be worth mentioning.However, if he were to encounter someone from Tian Fang ... Li Hao might have to pay a huge price!One should know that this was a great force with a ninth level venerable sovereign. It was a boundless force.That Daoist had already started to explain the Dao of fire.Li Hao suppressed his excitement and continued to listen, trying to understand the deeper meaning. A seventh-rank venerable sovereign who could enter the advanced level definitely had a profound understanding of the great Dao. The Dao of fire was actually also an element.His insights into the fire-type Dao would allow him to derive the five elements and even more elemental DAOs. For Li Hao, this was also an opportunity.His Foundation was the secret skill of five birds, which was in essence a secret skill of five elements.But this time, although he was excited and happy ... There was a lot of gloominess in his heart.He couldn't mess around with the power of time!The first was the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, and the second ... Was a future crisis that could be incomparably troublesome!Tian Fang had suddenly disappeared. Although he had been taken away by the master of Tian Fang, who knew the exact situation?He had already spied on the Dao of two rank seven venerable sovereigns!This kind of karma ... Perhaps, he would have to pay ten times or a hundred times the price. Didn't that mean ... Even a ninth-grade spirit beast would find it difficult to repay.Li Hao secretly warned himself that he couldn't mess around anymore!If this continued, something bad was going to happen.He had been a little too arrogant recently.He had said that he would keep a low profile, but now, he was not low-key at all. He was just a first level venerable sovereign. He could not be so reckless. Even if he really wanted to comprehend, he should activate his Taoist connotation to comprehend it. This way, it would not involve time!After these two times, he had a shallow understanding of the tianfang Dao and the great Dao universe.If he went to the place of Taoist connotation again, he might be able to stimulate the Enlightenment of the Taoist connotation through normal means instead of turning back time. This was good, but the price he had to pay was great!This time, the other party had elaborated on the great Dao for a long time, explaining it in a flowery manner.Li Hao also felt the uniqueness of the fire element.It wasn't like what he had imagined or understood. Fire was fire ... Wrong.The fire element had too many meanings.The myriad existences and DAOs in the world were actually all fire in the sky. They were flames, inheritances, enlightenment, light, life-saving objects. Fire could give birth to civilizations, to eras, and to myriad DAOs ...In the past, his comprehension of fire was too shallow.Even if the lecture given by two seventh level venerable sovereigns was simple, it was still a great opportunity for Li Hao.He needed some time to digest all this.After a long time, the explanation of the great Dao ended.Daoist flaming looked in Li Hao's direction and sighed."The Dao of time is too complicated. I don't understand it, and the realmlord might not understand it too well either. As for you ... You might not be strong enough ... But you were able to come into contact with time. Time ... Was the greatest enemy of cultivators! No person, no object, even the world, even chaos, can escape time!""Good luck!"As soon as he finished speaking, the world spun.Li Hao instantly fell from the past and crashed into the river. At this moment, the power of time was flowing in the river. Li Hao's expression changed, and he hurriedly dispelled all the power of time.

He raised his head and frowned.The lightning tribulation had almost descended!At this moment, the giant pincer beside him was a little frightened.""Senior ... Just ... Just now, some news came in. Outside the primordial chaos, it seems ... A Primal Chaos lightning tribulation has appeared! It's said that the Silvermoon world, a subsidiary world of the yin-yang world, once provoked a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Now ... The higher-ups are looking into whether the new Supreme Emperor ... Is related to the Silvermoon ..."Li Hao secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Her reaction speed was really ... Godly.He had just arrived, but he had already become one of the observation targets.Since Red Moon had spread the news, it seemed like she was determined to kill Silver Moon.Li Hao exhaled and said,"it's fine. It has nothing to do with me. Report to your venerable sovereign that I want to join the Dragon returning temple!"Li Hao was extremely calm."I'm just a passer-by. Whether it's neo martial arts, yin-yang, or Crimson Moon ... They have nothing to do with me. Don't look for trouble, understand?""I ... I understand!"The giant pincer was a little frightened and scared. 'You ... Really won't kill me to silence me?'Li Hao seemed to know what he was thinking. He smiled and said,""Killing people to silence them is the behavior of people with a guilty conscience! I'm not guilty, so why do you have to do this? The strong killed the weak to silence them ... They were not enemies yet, so why bother? When you really talk nonsense, I'll kill you ... With the snap of my fingers!"The giant pincer's heart trembled. This ... What a strange way of saying it.To experts, did they need a reason to kill?The giant pincer was a little confused and could not help but ask,""Senior, the strong prey on the weak, and the strong kill the weak ... Do you still need a reason? As long as you suspect me, just kill me ..."Li Hao thought for a while and said seriously, in the past, I actually thought the same way, and I did the same thing! After that, I experienced a lot and understood that it was impossible to kill all your enemies. Many of your enemies were actually created by you! There's no need to kill people all the time ... If you really want to kill people, you have to be careful and eliminate the roots, wiping them out in one fell swoop and leaving no hidden dangers!""Otherwise...Unless there's no other way, killing is not the way to solve the problem."He sighed with emotion."If the previous one didn't provoke me again and again, I wouldn't have done this. After all ... The one behind him is still alive. For example, if I kill you now, I'll immediately be exposed and become an enemy of the Huilong temple!""It's better to join the Dragon Temple. Even if it's a little troublesome ... It'll be better. "Li Hao smiled and said,"there is often more than one way to solve a problem." The worst result is to become enemies with Huilong temple. Killing you is the worst result!"Countless thoughts appeared in the giant pincer's mind.At this moment, he was deep in thought and seemed to have gained some enlightenment."Senior, how ... How should I reply?" he asked after a long time.Li Hao laughed,"you're asking me?" Just say it, including the battle with that person. Just say what you see and don't make any guesses. The more you say, the more mistakes you make!" Tell others?Then ... Didn't that mean that it was meaningless to show his Taoist connotation to restrain the two venerable sovereigns?Li Hao seemed to have seen through him again."Before, you didn't care when you returned to the Dragon Temple. Now that you care, how can they not know that I went out once?" Since that's the case, there's no need to hide it. It's not like there's no one outside the realm gate. If I go out, that person goes out...It'll all be recorded. If you hide it, you'll die!"The giant pincer was instantly shocked!Right, I almost forgot about this."Thank ... Thank you for your guidance, senior!" He gulped.Li Hao laughed.What did I point out?  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The giant pincer did not dare to delay and quickly reported the news. However, its heart was shaken. Was there really no problem?A venerable sovereign had disappeared!Not only that, this person in front of him ... Was he a neo martial artist, or ... Was he the new king of the Silver Moon?At this moment, he could not be sure.Logically speaking, the new king of the Silver Moon should not be this powerful, right?Countless thoughts appeared in his mind.At this moment, he felt that there was a huge gap between him and these venerable sovereigns. He couldn't read their minds at all.And what he was thinking, the other party knew.At this moment, Li Hao looked up into the sky. I'm going back to the Dragon Temple. Perhaps ... They'll come to me soon.A sixth rank venerable sovereign!Perhaps ... Next, this person would personally meet him. Thousands of thoughts emerged in his mind. He was really bold. Didn't he say that he wanted to keep a low profile?Li Hao sneered. So what?

Chapter 2616 Fellow Daoist (1)
So what?Li Hao wasn't invincible, but he was fearless.Fearlessness did not mean that he could rival a sixth level venerable sovereign. It was just a psychological fearlessness. He had seen many high-level venerable sovereigns, whether they were seeking Dao or seeking Dao.These advanced venerable sovereigns were either helpful or threatening to him.These were all rare moments in life.Even if it was an enemy, a sixth level venerable sovereign, although dangerous ... But on the path of cultivation, which part of it wasn't dangerous?Didn't he already anticipate this the moment he walked out of Silver Moon? Whether it was the red moon or the Dragon Temple, they were just a stone on the road. They could be moved away or crushed. If this road was blocked and there was no way to go, what harm was there in dying after seeing the glory?If a Paragon of life and death could not see through life and death, how could he cultivate life and death?At this moment, Li Hao had a different understanding of life and death.One must not fear death, not fear death, but ... One must Revere death!If one heard the Dao in the morning, one could die at night, but one had to hear the Dao.Death was not to be feared. What was terrifying was that death was as light as a feather.To die in vain was not cultivation.Even the way of life and death was not cultivated in this way.All kinds of thoughts emerged in Li Hao's mind. He said nothing and continued his cultivation. In the river of life and death, besides the venerable sovereign he had killed, there was actually another venerable sovereign Red Moon.Rank three venerable sovereign!Of course, a lot of Red Moon sovereign's energy was integrated into the Silver Moon world for the cultivation needs of several powerhouses, but a lot of it was still integrated into Li Hao's River of Life and death.Today, a part of the energy had been absorbed by Li Hao.Although Li Hao did not advance to rank two immediately, he now had a clearer direction in his path after learning from two rank seven venerable sovereigns.Life and death were still the core of this stage!"Life and death want to transform ... I still need some time. Life and death are in a transition. I will be born instantly and die instantly. Life and death are decided by a single thought!"Li Hao had some understanding.For the Dao of life and death to enter the third stage, or even undergo a transformation to enter the fourth stage, he would need some things."The exchange between life and death, it's best to use the power of life and the power of death to form the life and death millstone!""Crossing the river, yin and yang combine!"" 360 void Dao, 360 truth Dao, combine Dao and form 360 life and death bridges!"  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, Li Hao once again had a clear understanding of his own path.He was walking the path of the myriad DAOs as one, but at this stage, life and death were the most important.He had already started to merge the truth path and The Phantom path.However, the fusion was not enough to match life and death. He needed to create the 360 bridges of life and death. With the fusion of life and death, he would form the foundation of the long river and his body as the boundary. Only then could he quickly step into the third level of life and death and undergo a transformation.At this moment, Li Hao was lost in his thoughts.And after the 360 paths were combined, he had been thinking about what he should do next.The two sky Empyreal Kings also gave him some enlightenment. Dao was not the only one.The Path of Fire wasn't the only one. There were many.The path of the physical body was not the only one.The various DAOs in the world were not the only ones.Path split!The 360 Dao techniques were further divided into smaller portions!With the river of life and death as the foundation of his great Dao, he would then be able to form the bright moon sword Dao, the thousand path sword, and the ten thousand path sword. He would become the true thousand path sword and ten thousand path sword, and not the illusionary finger he was using now!At this moment, the giant pincers beside him were silently waiting for Hui long temple's reaction.In his heart, he was still extremely nervous.What would the consequences be?Would he directly capture this person when he returned to the Dragon Temple?Or was he ... Feigning civility?At this moment, he didn't know what these venerable sovereigns were thinking.As for Li Hao ... He didn't know his name, but he knew that he called himself Supreme Emperor Hao Yue!Haoyue ...Silver Moon!Although the two were different, he couldn't stop thinking about it. The more he thought about it, the more frightened he became.Li Hao seemed to be thinking about something. He became more and more uneasy. At this moment, Li Hao suddenly raised his head. After a while, the giant pincer's expression changed, and the void fluctuated.A figure appeared.The giant pincer was shocked. When it saw who it was, it hurriedly said,""Your subordinate greets Emperor void!"Empty silence Thearch!He was one of the few middle-stage venerable sovereigns in the Hui long temple, with the strength of the fourth rank.Although the Daoist master of the Hui long temple was a sixth-rank venerable sovereign, it did not mean that there were many middle-rank venerable sovereigns in the temple. On the contrary, even if they sought refuge, most of them would seek refuge in the great world, not a sixth-rank venerable sovereign without a world!Therefore, apart from the temple master, there were three other middle-stage venerable sovereigns in Huilong temple. Two of them were fourth-rank venerable sovereigns, and one fifth-rank venerable sovereigns.This kind of strength was actually already very terrifying.There were a total of four middle-stage venerable sovereigns!Anyone in the Hui long temple was a ruler and not a subordinate. Even the temple master treated the middle-stage venerable sovereigns with respect. Every time there was a mission, it was driven by benefits and definitely not a simple order.Otherwise, the chaos was so vast that even the great worlds would welcome middle-stage venerable sovereigns to join. Why would they need to rely on a sixth-stage venerable sovereign?This time, as soon as the information was reported, a fourth stage venerable sovereign came.Obviously, the Huilong temple also attached great importance to it.Li Hao didn't pay any attention to it. He pondered for a while and figured out something. Then, he bowed slightly."Bright moon world's Li Hao greets the venerable sovereign!"The venerable sovereign void solitude looked young.He didn't feel displeased by Li Hao's previous neglect. At this moment, he looked around, nodded, and smiled.""I've been presumptuous and disturbed fellow Daoist's enlightenment!"

Chapter 2617 Fellow Daoist (2)
"You're too kind, Emperor void!"Both parties exchanged a few pleasantries.Kong Ji, on the other hand, had some doubts in his heart. Just now, did some Taoist connotation appear here?It was a very weak feeling!However, the feeling was somewhat similar, but ... The appearance of the Taoist connotation should not have caused such a small movement and affected such a small area.He was a little puzzled.In addition, this person had introduced himself, and he had never heard of the bright moon world.Li Hao?Li Hao ... The surname "li" was a different name in the chaosverse. Of course, when translated, it was somewhat similar, but this title with a first name did sound a bit like a neo martial artist!From what he knew, there were many powerhouses with the surname Li in the neo martial world.It was the sword Saint, li Changsheng.Heavenly King suppression ... Or celestial venerable li or something. Anyway, he knew that his surname was li, but he wasn't too sure about his actual name. In addition, there was Ming Zun Li Zhen, who was said to be a descendant of celestial venerable suppression. He was also a rather powerful sword cultivator.And this person, Li Hao, was the sword Saint in the Silver Moon world.The Silvermoon, the bright moon.At this moment, the level four venerable sovereign couldn't help but size Li Hao up. He was very young, and he could sense Li Hao's youth from his life level.However, although he was young ... He had some Taoist connotation.This was no ordinary venerable sovereign!Some venerable sovereigns, although they were venerable sovereigns, had ... Bullsh * t dao accumulations. Some venerable sovereigns had pure luck, the kind of dog-shit luck, and their comprehension of Dao was very weak.As a middle-stage venerable sovereign, Kong Ji didn't think much of those people.Even if they were very strong ... They wouldn't be interested in them.If one cultivated the Dao without comprehending it, it would ultimately be a futile effort.He was also a cultivator, so he approved of Li Hao more. Even though Li Hao was a level one venerable sovereign, he was stronger than some level two or three venerable sovereigns in his eyes.Moreover, if what the giant pincer said was true, that this person had really killed a venerable sovereign in an instant, then it was even more remarkable.Neo martial human King?This was also one of the reasons why he had come this time and not Daoist Hui long. According to the giant pincer, this person ... Might be a neo martial human King in disguise.However, at this moment, he was sure that it was not the neo Martial Emperor.It was completely different! He had never seen one before, but he had heard of the style and personality of the neo martial human King. He knew at first glance that Li Hao was not the same kind of person.In an instant, countless thoughts appeared in his mind. At this moment, he smiled."Fellow Daoist Hao Yue is too polite! I heard from the giant pincer that fellow Daoist is interested in joining our Dragon returning temple. Is that true? If a venerable sovereign is willing to join us, it would be a great joy for the Hui long temple! That's why I couldn't wait and came to visit without informing you. Please don't blame me for my rudeness!""Senior Kong Ji, you're too polite!"Li Hao also smiled."Of course I do. Of course, I'm just a passer-by. My heart is in chaos. If I have enough for my cultivation, I'll leave. I won't stay here forever.""It's normal. "He didn't feel that there was anything wrong with this emptiness. This was normal.Other than those venerable sovereigns who did not have great ambitions, who would stay in one place all the time?It wasn't easy for him to walk out of this world, but now he was trapped in another world, working like a slave for someone else. What was the point?It would be better to be free and unrestrained in his own small world!After all, he was an Overlord.Why was there a need to look at other people's eyes? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  "It's not a big deal. Even I don't dare to say that I'll stay in tianfang and the Dragon Temple for the rest of my life!"Kong Ji chuckled."When cultivators cultivate, they will have more knowledge and experience. They will travel the world and the chaos until one day, they can no longer travel. They will either settle down or return to their roots. During this period, be it power or location, it is just a scenery on our cultivation path!"p Li Hao was stunned. He looked at the venerable sovereign and said sincerely,""Senior, you do look like you're cultivating. I came to Tian Fang, thinking that everyone was here to cultivate, but I found out that ... They're all sealing themselves off. Not only that, but even their hearts are not as good as some of the strong people I've seen, far from being venerable sovereigns! What's the point of getting angry at every turn and barking helplessly?"These words seemed to point to something.Kong Ji laughed."Some people rely entirely on luck to advance or others 'guidance. They don't have any real ability. Please don't laugh at me, fellow Daoist. Such people can only be a venerable sovereign in name, but not in reality!" You've lost the face of venerable sovereigns for no reason and become a laughingstock. Don't worry about it!""I was too narrow-minded," Li Hao sighed."I think all venerable sovereigns are the same.""Most of them are."Kong Ji continued,"when you are old, no matter how wise and powerful you are when you are young, once you are old and have experienced hardships, some people can be motivated. Some people ... Will be weak! There are many venerable sovereigns in this world, but how many of them are devoted to the Dao?"He revealed a smile and waved his hand. A Pavilion appeared in the volcano. He smiled and said,""Fellow Daoist li, why don't we sit down and have a chat?""Alright!"Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony. He instantly sat down, and a stone table appeared above the lava. Li Hao took out a jar of wine and said with a smile,""I wonder if you would like to drink? I have a pot of good wine here, but I don't know if it will suit fellow Daoist's taste. ""Wine?"Kong Ji laughed."I've heard of it, but I've never drunk it before because different worlds have different customs. I know that it's a good thing. I can see it for myself today!"At this moment, the giant pincer finally came to its senses and hurriedly stepped forward.""Venerable sovereigns, I'll pour wine for you!"

Chapter 2618 Fellow Daoist (3)
Venerable sovereign void was actually so polite to this person.What was going on?The expected conflict didn't happen. Strange.He didn't say anything, nor did he dare to say anything. He quickly picked up the wine that Li Hao had brought out. In an instant, his face suddenly flushed, and he seemed to have fallen into an ocean of desire.One moment it was ferocious, one moment it was crazy, one moment it fell into a deathly silence, and the aura of death appeared.Kong Ji took a look. At this moment, the giant pincer was holding the wine jar and not moving.Kong Ji took a look and understood.The power of the Crimson Moon!The power of death!This Li Hao was not simple, and this jar of wine was even more so."Cough cough!"With a light cough, like a warning sound and a great Dao Bell, the giant Pincher suddenly woke up. Its eyes were clear and it instantly regained its calm. Its heart was filled with fear!In the next moment, he seemed to have understood something."Thank you, venerable sovereigns!" He suddenly bowed.At this moment, he seemed to have realized something. Although it wasn't very clear, it felt like he had completed a heart-tempering session.This ... For cultivators at the Heavenly King level, entering the venerable sovereign realm was extremely difficult.Cultivating the heart once was far more important than devouring countless amounts of energy.Terrifying!Li Hao couldn't help but look at Kong Ji, thinking,""The Dao of sound ... No, no, it's the Dao of nothingness?"Kong Ji's expression changed slightly. He looked at Li Hao and smiled."Fellow Daoist is really ... Knowledgeable! The Dao of nothingness ... What a good name! I usually call it the Dao of void! That's why I named it emptiness! In the end, ninety-nine percent of the cultivators didn't understand the deep meaning behind it. Some venerable sovereigns thought I was good at the sound of the great Dao. Today, after only one encounter, fellow Daoist could actually see it ... Fellow Daoist's vision and knowledge are definitely not as good as a first level venerable sovereign 's!"In the depths of his heart, he was still shocked.Being strong didn't mean that he had seen a lot, and it didn't mean that he was clear and serious about the great Dao.For example, the neo martial human King ...Alright, this was just a rumor.In fact, for a neo martial human King to be able to enter the seventh grade so quickly, he must have a deep understanding of the way of yin and yang. He was just pretending to be reckless. Kong Ji never dared to underestimate a neo martial human King!Everyone was saying that he was just lucky ... That would be weird!If he was lucky, even Kong Ji felt that he was just lucky to reach level six in the great world. He could quickly reach Level Seven and become a level Seven Yin Yang Supreme Emperor. If he was lucky, then all the Supreme emperors in the world would be useless!Kong Ji thought. At this moment, he thought of Li Hao.First stage venerable sovereign?Perhaps ... It was true.However, his perception of the Dao was very strong.How could this person have such knowledge? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  He thought to himself. At this moment, he had some speculations that this person was the new king of the Silver Moon! Fifty years later, the new king who walked out of Silver Moon!Li Hao ... Is he related to venerable sword?He wasn't sure.But that wasn't important!At this moment, the giant pincer poured wine for the two of them. Kong Ji picked up a cup and drank it. In an instant, the power of death exploded, and the power of desire rose.It was as if it wanted to burn him!Desire wanted to burn him, but the cold power of death seemed to explode in an instant and extinguish this power of desire. His heart moved as he looked at the giant pincers."I did something unnecessary. Desire burns and death power is destroyed. If I didn't interfere and stimulate desire and death power is destroyed, you would be more clear-headed and understand what Dao is!" Sighing, he looked at Li Hao and said, I was too impetuous! I thought you were testing me. "Li Hao laughed, I don't dare to take a test! It's just that the power of death is a taboo for most people. Daoist kongji, you're doing this for the giant pincer's good. Some people would rather see a Heavenly King die than to test the other party and see what cards they have up their sleeves ... You're much better than the venerable sovereigns I've met. ""I'm embarrassed!"At this moment, the giant pincer also understood and said hurriedly,""Thank you for your help, venerable Emperor Hao Yue!""It's just a pot of wine!"Li Hao smiled."It's the power of a Red Moon Emperor. It's combined with the power of death that I'm born with.""This Red Moon Emperor ..."Kong Ji laughed,"it should be the Crimson Moon world's sovereign Ying hun, a third stage sovereign!" Of course, although the venerable sovereigns of the great worlds were strong, they were only a portion of the people. Some of them were just one person who had achieved the Dao! This person is only ordinary among rank three venerable sovereigns!""I'm not sure about the other level three venerable sovereigns, but this one is quite difficult to deal with. "Li Hao nodded."That's relative. If you were rank three, killing him would be as easy as taking something out of your pocket!"At this moment, the giant pincer was frightened again.Oh my God!What were they talking about?Also, did venerable Emperor void really discover this person's identity?This man ... Was he really the new king of the Silver Moon?But how old was the new king of Silvermoon?No matter how many years had passed in the Silvermoon world, from the outside world, it would look like more than 50 years. After losing contact for more than 50 years, a venerable sovereign was born. In fact, it was also true that the birth of a venerable sovereign in a small world was usually very fast.But ... A newly born venerable sovereign was able to kill a third stage venerable sovereign ... What kind of concept was this?Which venerable sovereign wasn't an extremely powerful existence?Also, this Li Hao dared to expose his identity here. Wasn't he afraid that he would cause trouble for the Dragon Temple?Killing him ... Might give him a medium-level world!At this moment, he was somewhat confused, as was venerable Emperor Kong Ji. This was a level four venerable Emperor. If Li Hao was not a new warrior king but a new silver Moon King, it should not be difficult for a level four venerable Emperor to kill him!Li Hao and the others ignored the giant pincers.Li Hao thought for a moment and said, maybe! However, it's hard to reach the third rank!"

Chapter 2619 Fellow Daoist (4)
"Is it difficult for you?"Kong Ji sipped his wine and smiled."If you have enough energy, you might be able to reach the third rank. The third rank isn't a problem for you. The fourth rank should be a little difficult.""I need time.""At my current speed, it'll be at least three to five years later," Li Hao replied without hesitation.“……”The giant pincer was so shocked that it didn't dare to make a sound.Kong Ji was also stunned and laughed,"amazing!" Three to five years ... I originally thought that 30 to 50 years, or even 300 to 500 years, would be enough for me to be considered a genius! Now it seems that you're more confident and confident ... That's right, after all, you're a self-enlightened existence!""No," Li Hao shook his head,"I borrowed senior's grace!""That's still amazing!"The two of them were speaking in riddles. The giant pincer felt a chill all over its body and for a moment, it forgot to pour wine.It was only when Kong Ji gently knocked on the glass that he came back to his senses and hurriedly poured wine for the two. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Kong Ji drank another cup and seemed to be enjoying it. After a while, he said,""Back to the Dragon Temple, the temple master is interested in joining in the attempt to become a level Seven venerable sovereign ... It doesn't mean much to me! To me ... It's only a matter of time! However, Level Seven was too difficult! Moreover, by the time I reach the sixth step, the battle in the red moon region might have already ended. ""The Crimson Moon world is no match for neo martial!"He shook his head and said,"Red Moon master, an eighth rank venerable sovereign, has actually started to seek help. This is a lack of confidence ... Even if everyone says that it's because they have a deep foundation, what's the use of having a deep foundation?" To deal with neo martial, you actually have to call for help from all the worlds, delusionally trying to borrow strength to fight strength ... This is the root of failure!""This is the first reason! "Second, the neo martial human King is unscrupulous and kills everywhere to get rid of the red moon wings. On the other hand, it's also to intimidate everyone. With his reputation, the red moon Lord is actually afraid.""Third, the Crimson Moon world is based on desire ... The stronger the desire, the greater the fear! However, neo martial was different. Neo martial was famous for being crazy, but in essence, it was not crazy, but faith! A firm belief is not to believe in the human King, but ... To believe in the race, to believe in the spirit, to believe in resistance!"He spoke with fervor and assurance."Under such circumstances, neo martial has appeared in the chaos for more than a thousand years and has already swept across a region. I dare not say that neo martial human King is at the ninth-tier, but in my opinion, it's only a matter of time before he reaches the eighth-tier. Perhaps he'll reach it very soon! What did it mean to ignite the great path universe of The Dark World? Everyone saw madness, but I saw a great world and a great Dao universe. It's useless for him to improve!"Li Hao was stunned.He thought about it and nodded. Yes, it was useless!Otherwise, with the character of the neo martial human King, he would definitely devour and think of ways to make other movements.If he devoured it, he could enter level eight ... He would directly go to another major world. He had almost forgotten about this.This meant that the great Dao universe of a great world had no effect on the improvement of neo martial human Kings. This point ... Also proved that this person had probably reached the peak of the seventh level, or even infinitely close to the eighth level!Kong Ji laughed and said,"so, I judge that neo martial will win!" Of course, that's just my guess. I'm only at the fourth step, after all, and the gap between us is too big. I can't make a hasty conclusion!""If it wasn't me who came today but someone else, and your identity was exposed, what would you do?"When he came, he talked to Li Hao with ease and assurance. However, if it were any other venerable sovereigns who knew Li Hao's identity ... The temptation of a medium-level world was still great, and they would probably fight!"This is the tianfang world," Li Hao said with a smile. "In the past, many powerful existences lived here! I don't have much ability. If I risk my life, maybe ... I can borrow some strength. Of course, I will pay a huge price, but ... No one will feel good!"Borrowing force!Kong Ji was stunned again, how could he borrow it?He didn't really understand.There might be many types of great DAOs. The person in front of him might really be able to do it. Tian Fang had once been a rank nine venerable sovereign!Borrowing power here ... Could it be that he could also borrow the power of the ninth-grade?If that was the case ... It would be too terrifying!It was so terrifying that no one in the entire tianfang region could fight grade nine.This was someone else's trump card, so he didn't ask in detail.However, he knew that Li Hao wasn't trying to intimidate him. There was no need to. If he really wanted to intimidate him, Li Hao might not even stay. Instead, he would have fled long ago.This meant that it was true.Thinking of this, he asked again,"the chaos tribulation clouds outside, is it caused by fellow Daoist?.""It should be,""Terrifying!""I'm also annoyed!"Li Hao smiled bitterly and shook his head helplessly, to me, the existence of this thing ... Is too troublesome! I've already experienced it many times, it's too troublesome!"Kong Ji laughed,"you're a little pretentious!.""I don't think so?" Li Hao laughed."Definitely!""Then How long will you stay in the Dragon returning temple?" Kong Ji asked with a smile."One year,""A year?"He pondered for a while and nodded,'a year later, the chaos Bandit Alliance will make a move. It seems that ... Fellow Daoist has some ideas! At that time, there would be a fourth stage venerable sovereign leading the team. They would not be considered weak, but ... They would only be so-so! In fact, this is only bait. Both sides are competing to see who is better!""They're not the targets?"Li Hao frowned.
