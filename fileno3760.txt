If they didn't want to merge with the river, they naturally couldn't enter the river.Li Hao no longer cared or thought about it. He jumped over the wall of the world like a mountain stream. In an instant, Li Hao disappeared into the vast universe."He left?""He seems to have left ...""Where did he go?""I don't know ..."At this moment, the surviving gods and devils in the world were all trembling in fear. They had finally left.It was too terrifying!There were countless innate gods, but today, 90% of them were killed by that man.It was too terrifying!"Should we ... Enter the river of time?" someone asked softly."If we don 't, the chaos will be squeezed and we won't have much chance of survival ...""Shall we go in?""Then ... Let's go in!"Some of them didn't even ask and had already jumped into the river. The innate DAOs and the river DAOs were instantly connected and the great DAOs created the world!It was as if a fruit had grown on the river.The world started to appear between heaven and earth."I created the divine world!" A loud voice rang out."I'm the divine ancestor! All living beings of the world can enter the divine world and create a glorious era for the divine world!"At this moment, some of the humans that Li Hao had placed in the divine Kingdom seemed to be summoned by something. The cultivators who had been cultivating in the divine Kingdom began to fly toward a realm in the world in a daze.As the river flowed, it began to enter the rapidly expanding realm.At the sight of this, loud noises resounded between heaven and earth!"I am the devil ancestor. I created the devil World here. I will merge the Dao and time. All living beings of heaven and earth can enter my Devil World!""I'm the ancestor of Celestials, and I created the celestial world to ...""I am the Dragon ancestor. All the demons and beasts in the world can enter my Dragon World!"“……”From all four directions of the river, the surviving experts quickly entered the river and occupied their own territories. They began to merge with the river and their boundaries appeared, expanding rapidly.The first to fuse with the Dao would benefit more.At this moment, it was obvious that they couldn't defeat the river, and that person had left. If they didn't occupy it now, when would they occupy it?The great DAOs of these people merged with the river, and the realm began to expand as if the world was being created. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Although it wasn't as long as Li Hao's River, it wasn't inferior to the blood ancestor 's.Heaven and earth began to appear.The infinite worlds began to take shape.The surviving gods and devils began to find their own way out, and the trillions of humans became the target of many cultivators. Cultivating the same path could strengthen the other. The more people, the more people cultivating the same path, the higher the chance. The humans who remained in the time and space could vaguely hear the voice, but they couldn't hear it as clearly as the divine Kingdom cultivators outside. Even if they did, they didn't think much of it.This was because lingyue had long ago used her faith to call for them. If they were willing to believe in someone, they would have already entered the divine Kingdom.It was because they had no faith that these people stayed.At this moment, the world collapsed, mountains collapsed, and the earth cracked.In this time and space, a cultivator rose into the air. Suddenly, he sensed something, he discovered something. He saw the long river above his head, and an extremely thick great path that suddenly extended out.He was instantly ecstatic!He roared and flew into the sky. His great Dao merged into his body. He seemed to have sensed something and was overjoyed. He roared, "I'm the ancestor of humans. Today, I'm going to open the human world and establish the human race's world!"At that moment, the entire realm shook!The human realm!Around them, some of the more powerful realms that were still expanding heard the noise and were suspicious. It didn't seem like an innate God was there.It seemed like ... It came from the cultivator under the swordsman?They didn't see the details clearly.However, they also knew ... That at this moment, time cultivators might not have gone far, so it was best not to provoke them. As for Ren zu ... Some scoffed at him, some were indifferent, and some were slightly afraid.However, he seemed to have thought of something and didn't bother about it.Now, the world had just been created, the boundaries had just appeared, and the power of the great path was everywhere. There was no need for them to head into the depths of time. It would be troublesome if they were to draw that person back.However, many people were still thinking about how terrifying that person was.Swordsmen were terrifying.In addition to that, there were also the various great DAOs. Earlier, they had seemed to have been formed from words, which had fused into their DAOs. Now, it was as if ... Their minds were filled with the power of a legacy.Bloodline inheritance!The next generation might naturally possess some great Dao power and be able to cultivate the Dao of this world.This was an innate skill!It was natural, and it was related to the great Dao they fused.Outside the river, a demonic flame ancient beast was madly crashing into the river, but it was unwilling to merge with the river. It could only roar madly. As for why it didn't merge with the river when everyone else had already merged with it ... It just wouldn't merge with it!The demonic flame ancient beast thought to itself as its eyes turned cold. 'Since you won't let me in ... Then I'll fight you to the end. If I don't dare to make a move now, I'll devour the entire River sooner or later!'In the next moment, the demonic flame ancient beast quickly flew toward the other end of the river ...'Since this River has a gate on one side and no gate on the other ... Since no one is paying attention to it yet, why don't I ... Transform into a gate on the other side and see if I can compress and devour the river!'The infinite worlds began to change.Li Hao naturally didn't care about all this.……At the same time.Indistinctly, the sound of a long river could be heard.Su Yu and the others looked at the man in the distance with solemnity and doubt.

The person in the distance smiled and a star floated out from his hand."This is a time star. No second time star can appear at the same time. At this moment, that person has given up ... Time has no owner. This item ... Is yours!"Su yumang was confused. 'What's this? you're leaving it to me?'He looked at the man in the distance and frowned slightly."You are naturally lacking something compared to others ... When that person opened a realm, the foundation he forged was not as good as the true chaos ... If you want to surpass, be on par, or something else, the only way is to ... Break through the limits!"Su Yu looked at the person in front of him. He looked very comfortable, but ... He felt a little ethereal.In fact, he had already realized where he was.Looking around, it was dark. He fell into deep thought. After a long time, he said,""How about you?""Me?"The long-robed cultivator smiled."I've seen too much and I'm tired. I have no intention of getting involved in this. I'm a mortal cultivator. I cultivated the Dao and created time. Perhaps ... This is the last thing I regret in my life. The last thing a person should do is to look into the future ..."Su Yu raised his eyebrows slightly, nodded, and smiled.""That's true. People who see the future are all miserable! The more they are afraid of what will happen in the future, the more they fear. If the future is destined, doesn't that mean that all their struggles will be in vain?""That's right,"The long-robed cultivator smiled and nodded."It's a pity ... I was too curious. In the end, I couldn't help but pry too much. However ... The interesting thing is that some things might have really changed!""I'm leaving now ... Shi Guang, from now on, she's yours!""I don't want to!"Su Yu sneered,'what's mine? I can see that all of you are shameless. This thing is obviously a hot potato. You don't want this and you don't want that. In the end, you just threw it to me. I'm the master of a space civilization, not some time master ...""It's not up to you,"The long-robed cultivator laughed."Time passes on. You're the youngest. The predecessors didn't want you, so you can only have it!" Also, I didn't give it to you, but ... Generations of inheritors didn't want it ... Even if you refuse now, in the end ... It's still yours!" The long-robed cultivator laughed heartily."It's true. I'm not giving it to you ... I'm just leaving this item in this world. Whether you want it or not, you can take it as a reference. When you return to your original space-time ... This item ... Will most likely still appear by your side!"Su Yu was cursing!He was a little speechless.What did that mean?He quickly thought about it in his heart and roughly understood."In other words ... At this moment, even if he gave it to me, what I obtained is also fake, or perhaps it is not fake, but an illusion. The key is that between me and him, all the people who obtained the planet have given up.I'm the youngest, the last person to handle it. If the people before me don't want it ... Then I have to take it, is that what you mean?"Why not?" he could not help but ask."I don't know,"The long-robed cultivator shook his head and revealed a faint smile."Perhaps ... You'll find out in the future."With that, the figure disappeared.Su Yu looked at the disappearing figure and couldn't help but curse,""None of these old fellows are good!"It was a little annoying!Looking at the stars in front of him, he fell into deep thought. What was going on?This was ... Time and star? The source of the Dao of time?You don't want any of them, why are you giving them to me?"I cultivate in space civilization, not time ... Fine, actually, I do cultivate. I was born in the river of time, so it can be said that he has been in contact with time the longest and is the closest.The entire world was covered in time.He had never transcended!The Silver Moon was born in time, but the power of time was not strong enough and was concealed. Later, it was taken away by Li Hao and separated from time.As for the infinite worlds, they were born from time.Time ran through his entire life."So, if I don't master it, I won't be able to transcend?"Su Yu looked at the world in the distance and fell into deep thought."Then I've mastered ... Transcended. What do I want this thing for?"What's so good about flowing time!It was not good at all.Find another one to take over?He somewhat understood that these people were all looking for a scapegoat.From the looks of it, I'm the one taking over this time, right?As for why he didn't want it at all ... What was the point of having this thing? if he had nothing to do, would he just look at the past? Look at the future?Giving me trouble? n(0)velbIn[.]nEt In the past, they could watch small movies, but in the future ... Who would want to know what the future would be like? he turned to look at someone and smiled. Old Wan had seen the future once in the past ... What happened after that?In the end, he was almost killed by the future!Those who had seen the future did not have a good ending.Shi Guang was actually a trap.As he was thinking about this, he suddenly saw a person drilling out of the world in the distance. Su Yu looked at him and was a little confused. He also felt that the person looked familiar ...Suddenly, he had a thought.Eh!He looked ... Familiar. Although he had seen him from across the river, was the cultivator in big underpants the same person he saw last time?His strength ... Was average.That's only the level of a master of the natural order ... So, I've really returned to the past?Was this the past?This was ... The source of time?When he thought of this, he suddenly reached out and grabbed. The person in the distance who was still trying to escape was instantly grabbed by a huge palm. He was shocked!

Who was it?What was it?The next moment, a face appeared in front of him. The young sun god was shocked. Who was this?Why ... Was he so powerful?It was terrifyingly strong!Where was this place?Was this the outside of the seed world?"What a pity ..."The will's voice reverberated. The sun god was extremely shocked and nervous."Who ... Are ... You?"What a terrifying existence!"Who am I?"Su Yu chuckled."Someone ... Calls me Emperor Yu."Emperor Yu?p The sun god was shocked. Where ... Did this expert come from?Where did it come from?"Are you interested in taking a walk with me?"It was rare to meet a cultivator who could walk out of it. As for the world in front of him, he was not very willing to go in. If he went in and saw too much, once he interfered with the operation, the past would change, and perhaps ... The future would also change. Would he be changed?It was too troublesome!"This person shouldn't be a problem. He seemed to have recognized me last time. Perhaps, it will be this time.If that was the case ... Then it would be easy."Where ... Are you taking me?""I'm just taking a walk ..."Su Yu smiled and said,"I'm very interested in your civilization!" Of course, don't worry, I won't do anything, and I can't do anything. It's very dangerous outside, so don't run around, don't rush to go out.......Going out is the real danger!"Don't rush out?The sun god thought to himself, is it dangerous?He did not know.At this moment, he was completely ignorant of everything. He had only risen to power within this world, and now, he just wanted to come out and take a look.In the end ... He encountered great danger on the first day!It was indeed very dangerous!Su Yu didn't say much. He just turned around and looked at the small world. It wasn't strong at the moment, but he knew that there was a God here. He might not be that strong, but the other party ... Had cultivated time!What a terrifying fellow.To think that Shi Guang was really cultivated by a human!With a casual wave of his hand, a realm appeared in the distance and became a temporary shelter. Since he couldn't leave in a short time, he might as well take a rest nearby.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  It seems that I'll have to master some power of time and open up a long river before I can return to the original timeline.Because at this moment ... The river of time had disappeared."Obviously, if I don't cultivate and master some of it, I probably won't be able to leave. I'll be trapped in the memories of the past. Yes, in his opinion, these are just memories and may not be the real past. The past has disappeared.What came was only the depths of his memory. In the depths of Changhe's memory.In the depths of Shi Guang's memory.It could also be considered an opportunity."I'll rest here for a while. When I've mastered some power of time, I'll open up a River and connect it with my myriad world River. Then, I should be able to return. It seems that I'll have to wait for time to pass and return to our original timeline ... I just don't know what the ratio of time is. We're hundreds of thousands of years away from the opening of the sky ... I don't know how long it will take."The era of sky creation was still a few hundred thousand years away from them.'It seems that the old time bastard of the previous generation deliberately messed up time and space so that we wouldn't interfere with this history, right?He somewhat understood.He would wait for the flow of time in the chaos to be uniform before he could return.He just didn't know if the time flow there was fast or not.If it was slow ... Then he would have to stay here for a long time!"That's good. It'll be beneficial for us to get out of here if we learn more about the true chaos.……BOOM!The world of blood trembled.Li Hao walked out.A world appeared in front of him. It was the world that he had created. At this moment, a small door appeared.Outside, almost all the experts had come out.When one's spirituality was destroyed, they would naturally leave the world.While many people were discussing, the human King and the others had already left the vicinity and were ahead. Two powerful auras had arrived in front of them. Li Hao instantly recognized them to be Tian Fang's clone and huntian Supreme Emperor.As expected, the two of them were not dead.He was not in a hurry to care about it. Instead, he looked around and saw that almost all the people who had gone in had come out.From the looks of it, most of the godfiends he had killed before were from this group.It was best not to leave behind those who had entered through this method because their main bodies were still outside. Now that the pseudo-chaos had completely sealed them off, it would probably be difficult for them to return if they did not return.If he stayed inside for a long time and had countless years of memories before returning ... It would be troublesome. At that time, it would be hard to say who would be who.Li Hao glanced at them. Almost all of them came out.But soon, he frowned.He looked at Chunqiu, who had just woken up, and frowned,""Some of your men didn't come out!"Spring Autumn looked around and was slightly stunned. There was indeed someone who had not come out.This time, there were also a few great demons.But ... Now, there was one Greater Demon that had yet to come out.His physical body was still there, but there was no spirituality. It was obvious that he had not walked out.Li Hao frowned."When I split open the sky earlier, I killed almost all the normal spiritual godfiends that I sensed. That guy didn't show up. It seems like ... He's avoiding me on purpose!"Leaving a spirit behind might change some things. Of course, without the memory, at most, one's talent and strength would be slightly better.However, someone actually avoided him and didn't walk out. Li Hao wasn't very satisfied with this.Chunqiu looked at the big demon beside him and was speechless. He frowned and said,""Then now ... Can you let him out?"

Chapter 3763 Egoism In Chaos (3)
"No, I have completely cut off the connection with the inner world, unless I break through this world ... But I can't do such a thing for one or two people."After saying that, he glanced at the giant beast and said,""Forget it. It doesn't matter if it's an individual creature. It's just that ... The internal department needs to be fair. "What did that mean?Li Hao waved his hand at the giant beast and said, "I'll destroy its physical body and fuse its spirituality together. It doesn't make sense. If the person inside dies, so be it. If it dies, it can still return ... Since it intentionally avoided me before entering ... It's decided then!""No!" Spring autumn's expression was serious."Poshan is a rank eight demon under my command. You ..."Just as she was about to stop him, Li Hao suddenly disappeared and reappeared on the body of the huge demonic beast in an instant. With a punch, his body was instantly turned into powder, and his flesh and blood fused into the blood-red world.Li Hao chuckled, Spring Autumn, follow my rules! "I'm not killing it. Instead, I'm helping it. By merging my flesh and blood with it, it'll become stronger and more talented. When its spirituality returns, the essence of its flesh and blood will be more concentrated, far more talented than those with only one spirituality ...""It's called Poshan?"As for Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn, his face was grave. Li Hao ... Didn't he cut off time?At this moment, Li Hao didn't feel too strong, but he dodged him instantly and killed an eighth-level demon beast with one punch. Of course, it was normal that the demon beast had no spirit and only a body of flesh and blood.However, it avoided him ... That was not normal!As he watched Poshan's body crumble and be devoured by the blood-red world, the spring Autumn Emperor frowned.""Why do you have to do this? "The flow of time inside is very fast. When the person you're waiting for comes out, he'll follow. That'll be enough ... Now that the internal and external spirituality have merged into one, if he dies, he'll really die ..."Li Hao laughed,"that's fair, isn't it?" My teacher's soul is in there, so it can't be. My teacher can only die once, but this guy can return after he dies. That's not fair. "Spring Autumn cursed in his heart!Alright, I know what you're thinking.'What fairness? you're just unhappy that your teacher didn't become stronger, that you didn't find him, that you didn't bring him out.'It was a pity that the mountain was broken.Of course, if Poshan was still alive and could become stronger, it wouldn't be a big deal for him to return.When the flesh and blood fused, even if Poshan couldn't absorb all of it, he would still naturally be stronger than other gods.Spring Autumn didn't say anything more. He looked at the world and asked,""What do we do now? This world is right here. Once it's broken ..."After saying that, he looked into the distance and saw the human King and the others in a confrontation.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Spring Autumn actually didn't care whether or not he broke through. The important thing was that the current situation was unknown, and she couldn't determine Li Hao's strength. Although huntian was heavily injured, he was still the strongest.Furthermore, the tier 9 side was still alive.Li Hao had put in so much effort to create a fake world, but she hadn't been able to see much from it.At this moment, huntian's voice came from the distance,""Li Hao, you've returned? You've succeeded in splitting open the sky? Since that's the case ... Have you given up on time, or ... Have you continued to hold on to it?"​ At this moment, the confrontation in the distance stopped. Everyone was curious about Li Hao's current situation. He had opened the sky ... Would there be any benefits?Had he become stronger or weaker?Li Hao ignored them. He glanced at the bloody world in front of him. It was inevitable that the time inside and outside was different. More importantly, he was not sure when the situation inside would develop to the point where the pseudo-chaos would be unified.Perhaps, the one who walked out might not be that person.At this moment, if it was placed here, it might be forcefully broken by others.With this thought in mind, Li Hao suddenly kicked the bloody world away as if he was kicking a ball. With a hum, the bloody world flew through the air and instantly disappeared before everyone's eyes.Someone tried to track Li Hao's whereabouts, but sword energy emerged from Li Hao's body and instantly disrupted the entire void.Just like how the sword Saint had sent the Silver Moon flying, Li Hao kicked the fake chaos away.In an instant, the world disappeared.Li Hao chuckled. In this case, it would take some time to find it. He didn't know how long it would take, but he would do as he saw fit.The next moment, Li Hao disappeared.In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of them.Everyone looked at Li Hao, and the human King was also curious. Across from him, huntian was in a sorry state and covered in blood. Tian Fang's clone maintained some dignity as a tier 9, but he was also a little weak.They all looked at Li Hao!Had Li Hao changed after he split open the sky?Upon closer inspection ...They seemed to be deep in thought, and didn't seem to have changed much. The only thing that had changed was that they were less mysterious, and less ... Crazy.Li Hao was very peaceful today.He no longer had the madness of killing his master and everything.The master of tianfang quickly checked and sensed. He frowned slightly. Had he really given up on time?He could no longer sense the mysterious power of time from Li Hao.Did this guy really throw time into that world?His heart skipped a beat as he looked in the direction where that world had disappeared. In that case ... Shi Guang was in there?Huntian had obviously thought of this problem as well, and his eyes flickered."Li Hao, where's my heavenly policy of order?"

Li Hao smiled."It's inside. Shi Guang is there too. A lot of things are inside. I came out empty-handed.""What are you planning?""Do you know how many people died in this war?" huntian asked in a deep voice. How many worlds have you destroyed? The people were in misery! Even a level 9 died for your own selfish reasons, for your great cause of opening up the sky ... In the end, you left nothing behind. Li Hao, I don't understand!"So many people had died in this battle, and the West had been blown up.In the end, Li Hao had really given up everything.He could not understand!It wasn't just him, Tian Fang also didn't understand.This time, it could be said that the final winner was Li Hao. However, Li Hao had given up everything, which meant that he wasn't the winner either. On the contrary, he had lost time and order. He wasn't as difficult to deal with as before.Even if he still maintained the power of the eighth step, that was nothing.Without Shi Guang, Li Hao was not scary at all.If he didn't discard some and incorporate the New World into his system, continuing to be his river of time and great Dao, perhaps ... Li Hao would have a chance to reach level 9 this time!Of course, he might not succeed, but at least he would not be weaker than huntian and become the true Overlord of chaos.Before the descent of a tier 9, he was practically invincible. After all, he had even grasped the power of time."What's the point?"Li Hao smiled."For peace of mind and comfort! This thing keeps following me, making me unable to sleep well, eat well, and play with it. It's too much of a torture! I'm a little regretful now. I should've given up a long time ago. Look at how good the human King is. He sleeps well, eats well, and has fun ... Whoever is stained by time is unlucky. Don't you think so, human King?"The human King laughed heartily,"there's nothing wrong with that!" "Years ago, I knew that it's best not to take this thing. We young people are different from this old western guy. They are afraid of death. The older they get, the more afraid they are of death. With time, they might be able to live for a few more years. We are not afraid. In my opinion ... We should be completely destroyed! This thing will burn anyone who holds it!"  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  "Congratulations!"The human King laughed again."Without time, you're the real Li Hao. Otherwise, you wouldn't be free. Some things shouldn't exist!"Tian Fang didn't care about the crazy words of these two people.Time ... It's not as simple as you think. Without time, perhaps chaos would be destroyed sooner or later. He said in a low voice,"Li Hao, you created the world. Since you don't want it and don't care who you give it to, why ... Did you hide the world?"If you don't want it anymore, why are you still hiding the world?"My heavenly policy of order is still in it," huntian said in a low voice."Li Hao, if order doesn't appear, chaos will descend. It's not good for the common people and the world. Why do you have to do this?"With that, he turned to look at Chunqiu who was flying in the distance. At this moment, Chunqiu was also flying over. Huntian looked at the few of them and knew that they were not to be trifled with.Although he was still alive, he was injured.Even if Li Hao really lost his combat power, it would be difficult for him to deal with the Joint Forces of human King and Spring Autumn. As for Tian Fang's clone, it would consume a lot of energy. The clone was not weak, but there were still a large number of level eight venerable sovereigns present! If they really fought, they might not have any advantage at this moment.Since Li Hao doesn't want those ... Why can't he give them to us?He was a little annoyed!At first, he had thought that Li Hao was just saying it for fun, but the madman had really thrown everything away. At this moment, he couldn't understand Li Hao's thoughts at all.Crazy!This time, for you to split open the sky, half of the experts in the chaos died.Other than these people in front of you, other than those grade-9 powerhouses who can't come out...Do you know how many people have died?Beast!You actually lost it just like that? then wouldn't this battle have been fought in vain?p Everyone didn't get any benefits, but the cultivators in the inner world instead?Or ... Spirit?Li Hao smiled."Huntian, your heavenly policy of order is in it, so ... You have the best chance of finding it. Why don't you go find it yourself? tianfang, I'm not trying to sow discord. The truth is ... If you follow huntian, you'll definitely have a better chance of finding it. Once you find it, I won't care anymore! I hid it out of humanitarian concerns. After all, it was opened by me, so I should at least give it some protection. But now ... I don't know where I threw it!""If the two of you want to find it, go find it yourself. It has nothing to do with me!""Or perhaps, you two want to kill me? Even though I don't have time anymore, I might not be afraid of you two!"The two of them looked at each other and cursed in their hearts!Good Lord, here it comes again.Clearly, this guy was starting to sow discord again.But that was the truth. Huntian, which had the heavenly policy of order, would definitely have an advantage over Tian Fang. Tian Fang clearly knew this. Even if Li Hao didn't say anything, he would still follow huntian.What he was struggling with right now was ... Whether he should ... Make a move at this moment!After thinking about it for a while, huntian decided to give up. Forget it, there was no advantage to speak of if he attacked now. Perhaps ... When order returned, there was still hope. Moreover, time was also involved.He snorted coldly and instantly disappeared.The tianfang clone also sighed,""You ... Are really beyond my expectations. Li Hao, I really admire you. When the chaos great Dao is peaceful and my true body descends ... Perhaps we can have a chat. We don't have to fight."Now that Li Hao was no longer in control of time, it was not necessary to kill him.Although this guy was a scammer!

Chapter 3765 Egoistic Chaos (3)_7
However, at this moment, almost all of their forces had been wiped out. Even without time, Li Hao could still be considered a talent.Li Hao smiled calmly."There's no hurry. We'll talk about it after your main body arrives. So many people have died this time, and the chaos is under less pressure. Although I've taken some away, a lot of it has leaked out, which is also beneficial for the arrival of a stage nine! I hope that all the seniors will be able to descend smoothly ..."The tianfang clone didn't say anything more and instantly disappeared.Without Shi Guang, they could kill Li Hao, but it wasn't easy to do so. Although everyone hated that this guy had killed too many people this time, it was more important to find a new world!At this moment, Li Hao let out a sigh of relief and laughed."Comfortable! Without Shi Guang, these guys are finally not watching me anymore!"The human King chuckled."I pity that kid in the future. The moment he comes out ... He'll probably be surrounded and suppressed ... You're really a piece of trash!"Li Hao shrugged."You can't say that. Senior human King threw time to me, leaving behind a world that isn't even a small world. If I throw it to him, not to mention whether he will get it, even if ... I throw away such a huge Foundation, it can be said that my starting point is a hundred steps higher than mine. If I'm still not satisfied with this ... Where can I go to reason? If he's looking for me, who should I look for?"He glanced at the human King with a faint smile.Am I still considered a scammer?I'm not cheating at all!How much property did new martial leave for Silver Moon?The energy that was less than a small world, and then ... It was gone.What about me?How much did I leave for that person?"This time, how many people have died? how many powerhouses have been killed? compared to the human King, I can be said to be a man of conscience, a true hero who loves to help others.This time ... Li Hao felt that there was no problem in calling himself a swordsman.Of course, the enemy was a different story.At that time, they were just some weaklings who didn't know anything. This time ... The entire chaos was focused on them, a group of level nine experts!This was not within Li Hao's consideration."There are still quite a number of grade-9 cultivators left. However, in such a huge chaos, the only one who can pose a threat now is chaotic heaven ..."Chunqiu didn't say anything. 'You and I are not on the same side.'Of course, there was no need for a conflict for the time being."This time, we all have some gains. Let's digest them and find a new world while they are gone. We will rest for a few days, maybe a few years, maybe a few decades and see when the chaos great Dao will calm down!"As long as the turmoil did not subside, they would not be able to pose a threat in a short period of time and would not come again.After that, he glanced at neo martial and smiled.""Senior Sun god, rest well and don't run around."Sun god was stunned. This Li Hao ... What was he saying? Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  He thought of something and couldn't help but ask,""You mean to say ...""I'm not sure," Li Hao said with a smile."But perhaps some of your memories from the past aren't very clear. After some rest, they might be clearer!"After saying that, he turned around and sighed,""Today, it's me, Li Hao ... Time has done a lot of harm. I hope ... There will be no more time!"The human King's eyes flickered and he smiled.""That will depend on whether the third generation is ruthless enough!""Who knows?" Li Hao was extremely carefree. He laughed and said,"let's go. We'll go back to our homes and rest for a few days. Then, we'll play with the level 9 ..."His laughter was hearty and no longer as crazy as before.The human King looked at it for a while and laughed,""It's hard to change a person's nature, don't push everything onto the great Dao ... You brat ... It'd be strange if you could be stable!"At the side, the Supreme martial artist sighed."That's right. It's hard to change a person's nature. So ... It'd be strange if you could be stable!"“……”The human King wanted to curse. What do you think I'm doing?He was too lazy to pay attention to her and looked in another direction. He grinned and said,""I don't care how strong Li Hao is now. I only care ... How many people will surround him and beat him up if he comes out. Will he fight Li Hao to the death?"You're bored!Grandmaster was speechless. Human King suddenly turned his head and said sneakily,"Old Zhang, did you leave anything in there when you came out?""How could that be?" Grandmaster frowned and shook his head.The human King chuckled,"stop pretending. When I died and my memories were restored, I saw you ... Did you inscribe your avatar Dao into it?"“……”The Grandmaster was speechless. How could that be? The human King sighed,"you're really a piece of trash. That clone Dao of yours is too much of a scam. I wonder if it will cause people to suffer. If you want to test it, you can test it yourself. Why do you have to scam people ..."The Supreme martial artist coughed lightly."There's no such thing. I was killed normally and imprinted some Dao laws into it ... You're overthinking it!"The human King scoffed!"Li Hao has lost time, the river of Dao, and the divine text," the sun god suddenly said."He has nothing ... How strong is he now, purely with his physical body?"The human King glanced at him and laughed."I don't have time, divine text, or the long river of Dao. Guess what my strength is?"The sun god was stunned.The human King chuckled."This grandson of his doesn't even cultivate his inner world. I think ... This madman, if he's really the only one in all DAOs ... No, it's the only one in chaos!"Chaos?The sun god was stunned, and the Grandmaster nodded thoughtfully.He didn't say much.He didn't cultivate the outside Dao, was he the only one in the chaos?However ... This path might not be easy to walk.After giving up some, could Li Hao ... Really reach the peak?He couldn't say or judge.To be able to give up, it meant that his perseverance was extraordinary, and he had already surpassed countless people.Back then, he and the human King did not dare to accept Shi Guang. Otherwise, they might not have been able to give up. Of course, that was hard to say. But now, after accepting her, the only one who could still give up was Li Hao.

3766 Chapter 609
The battle of sky-opening had come to an end as the two powerhouses pursued the New World.There were countless casualties in this battle.The West had collapsed.The powerful cultivators under huntian were almost all wiped out. Only a few Level 7s didn't participate in the battle, so they were able to stay alive and defend huntian world.Chaos died in battle. Long Zhan and a large number of experts from the chaos race died in battle. The hidden type 9 experts and ancient existences also died in battle.After the battle, chaos fell silent.p He was gone.It was almost empty.At the very least, more than half of the powerful cultivators had died. Now, the five elements of the North had been completely annihilated, and the war of the four dragons had been lost. Even though spring and autumn had not suffered much losses, this battle had caused her to begin to doubt herself.Can I ... Really win against these guys?If they weren't extremely sinister, they were extremely crazy, or they had all sorts of trump cards ... She wasn't weak, but who could she win in a battle like this?She was even more afraid of Li Hao, who was the youngest.Yes, fear.Even if Li Hao had given up everything, she was still afraid, because ... Li Hao had easily destroyed Poshan's physical body right under her nose. She hadn't been able to stop him in time.This was unbelievable!……Alliance City nine.This place had practically become Li Hao's and silver moon's base.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  However, at this moment, many venerable sovereigns in the Alliance City were sighing. The previously prosperous heavenly Daoist Rite had disappeared.As Li Hao abandoned time, the passage of time could no longer be maintained. Now, there were still some illusionary worlds in various places, but they could no longer connect to the heavens. The previously bustling heavenly Daoist Rite collapsed just like that.The group of people felt a little regretful.He sighed.The existence of the heavenly Daoist sect had made many venerable sovereigns grateful to Li Hao. However, with the outbreak of the war, Li Hao had given up everything and the heavenly Daoist sect was gone. Now, those venerable sovereigns did not dare to go out easily ...All of a sudden, the entire chaos fell silent.More than half of the strong were dead, and the weak did not dare to leave the realm. The place to exchange the great Dao was gone, and the chaos seemed to have become a dead land."AI!"Myriad transformations Emperor sighed. He seemed to be in a bad mood.He had benefited a lot from the establishment of the heavenly Daoist field and reached level eight. After that, he followed Li Hao's side and participated in many battles. He even had the opportunity to join the new heaven of harmonious spirit and was an original God for a while.However, when he returned to Alliance City number nine and saw the collapsed passageway, he felt a little empty. The 10000 emperors that had gathered were now empty, leaving behind only an illusory realm.No more!All gone! Of course, it was much better than the North and the West. The Northwest and the West were almost wiped out. Almost all the advanced venerable sovereigns had been killed.In the East ... Well, the tier 8 players from the East, other than neo martial and silver Moon, were almost all killed.At this moment, the huge chaos seemed a little desolate.No one was able to enter the bustling heavens Daoist Rite temple, so the myriad transformations Emperor naturally sighed.The others were a little worried.He was worried about Li Hao!Without time, without divine text, without the river of the path ... What was Li Hao going to do next?Although the primordial chaos was in a desolate state, the experts were still there.Even if the chaos great Dao was in turmoil, there was still time. It would calm down sooner or later. At that time, if a tier 9 descended ... Would they rely on the neo martial to rescue them?Would they let Li Hao go?It won 't!Li Hao had screwed everyone over this time. Because of him, the level 9s 'avatars were killed, and huntian was even more miserable. This time, if it weren't for the fact that Li Hao wasn't absolutely confident in taking down human King and Spring Autumn, he would have been killed on the spot when he left new heaven."Lord Marquis!"Qian Wuliang was a bit worried.This time, he had also entered it and had gained a lot. He had even comprehended some things and left behind some inheritances that belonged to Silver Moon in the long river. However ... What could he do?Even if there would be powerhouses in the future, the future was the future. They ... Were not Silvermoon people after all.Just like neo martial!The Silvermoon people would not announce to the outside world that he was a neo martial inheritance and they were only silver Moon inheritances.And now, Yuan Shuo had died and did not return.As for Li Hao, he had lost time, order, and everything ... The massive Silver Moon suddenly showed signs of decline. Now, Silver Moon was weak, and in the future, if there were new people, Silver Moon would not even have as many experts as the future side.New martial lost the human King, but there were still Supremes, sun god, and many people ...But Silver Moon?Gan Wuliang was extremely pessimistic. No matter how good their relationship was, Silver Moon would always be Silver Moon. Today, it was possible that they would become the first power to be destroyed.Whether there were many enemies or not, the key was that their backbone was weak.As for Li Hao killing Poshan's physical body, everyone had actually seen it, but ... What they didn't see was that Spring Autumn had tried to stop him, but he had failed. They only felt that Li Hao killing a completely destroyed physical body was not difficult.Even if Li Hao maintained the strength of a beginner at the eighth step, it would be useless.In the primordial chaos, those who had just entered grade eight were considered experts, but not overlords.Without an absolute Overlord ... Where would Silver Moon go?Wushan, Thunderlord, Dao Qi, ermao, void, and myriad transformations were all outsiders. As for the level 8 natives, apart from Li Hao and Yuan Shuo, who had managed to reach it by luck.But now, with Yuan Shuo's death, Li Hao's strength had greatly declined. There was no third tier 8 powerhouse in Silver Moon.

3767 Chapter 609
At this moment, the surrounding Silver Moon martial masters were all silent.The Silver Moon's side seemed strong as they battled the heavens, but in recent days, everyone had gained a lot. From the heavenly Daoist Rite to the opening gods, everyone had gained a lot.But today, only Qian Wuliang, hei Bao, and Hong Yitang had reached Level 7 by luck, let alone level 8.Empress Ling Yue had been absorbing Primal Chaos energy the entire time, but she was only at the peak of the sixth step today.The others were all at the middle level venerable sovereign realm. This time, it was not too difficult for them to reach the seventh level. Everyone had gained a lot, but the premise was that they needed a large amount of energy. However, they did not have it now!Li Hao had filled them into a whole new world.Without enough energy, without enough storage, even if everyone's comprehension reached the seventh step, it would be impossible.If they didn't have any new martial artists, they would have a hard time. At this time, Qian Wuliang was worried that if Li Hao abandoned some of them, where would Thunderlord and the others go?In the end, they were only outsiders.He was not a native of Silver Moon.Today, the strong were fighting for hegemony. If Li Hao had opened a new Sky and advanced a step further, there would naturally be no problem, but ... Li Hao had abandoned the new Sky. Although he had expected this, Li Hao had always said so.At this point, the Silvermoon people were still helpless.Alliance City.Li Hao was sitting in the air with his legs crossed. Hearing Qian Wuliang's sigh, he turned around and smiled. "What's wrong?"Qian Wuliang was a bit nervous, but he still said,""Lord Marquis, this ... This time, everyone has gained a lot. The improvement in our realms and the opening of our horizons have been great ... The innate gods, the natural integration of the Dao, the convergence of spirituality, including the establishment of the heavenly Daoist sect and the Enlightenment, all of these have been great improvements for us!"Many venerable sovereigns never had such a chance in their lives.They had all experienced it in a short time.This included the War in the West, where a large number of powerhouses fought each other ...This was a rare experience. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, Qian Wuliang still said,"the current Silvermoon universe is still quite powerful. After Dean Hong left, Black Panther reached Level Seven, and I combined my two DAOs into one, so I've also stabilized at Level Seven ... For now, Silvermoon should be able to support one more level Seven ... But any more ... It'll be difficult. I can only rely on myself to build my own Dao domain and absorb energy to reach Level Seven."Currently, Silver Moon could only support one more venerable sovereign to reach the seventh rank.A seventh-rank was an invincible master in the past, but now ... What was the use of it?Now, he had some ideas about the eighth-rank, but ... Where did the energy come from? With the Silver Moon's size and dual-Dao universe, it would be difficult for it to become an eighth-tier universe if it did not devour the chaos heaven world.Unless he ignored Silver Moon and left to construct his own Dao domain, there was still hope. If he wanted to bring the entire universe to level eight ... It would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens!On the side of new martial, it was unknown how much energy it had swallowed before it barely entered the eighth-tier universe.Silver Moon actually had a chance as well ... This time, if Li Hao didn't start a new world, it would be very easy for Silver Moon to reach level eight.Everyone was a little worried.Silver Moon had won this battle!In one battle, almost all of the enemies were killed. However, even if they were all killed, those tier 9 experts and huntian were enough for everyone to be worried about. Those who died were all weaklings, while the strong ones were still alive. At this moment, myriad transformations Emperor also spoke,""Supreme Emperor Hao Yue, now that the time passage has collapsed and the heavenly Daoist field has been destroyed, is there still a chance to revive it?"In the future, even if someone were to take control of time, would they still build such a place?The Dao discussion of the heavens ... What a pity.If it only lasted for a short period of time, perhaps they would become venerable sovereigns. They would have a lifetime's worth of memories and no future.Thunderlord didn't say this. Instead, he said,""As order dissipates, chaos dies in battle, and the great Dao of chaos roars ... Now, chaos is in turmoil, and order no longer exists. I think we have to continue the chaos ... If this continues, I'm afraid there will be another war, and the grade 9 realm will descend at any time!"Dao Qi was also a little worried."When I broke the Tian Fang transmission channel, some of the spatial power in my body was completely destroyed ... Now, I no longer have the ability to teleport. Once a battle breaks out, we ... Will not be able to escape!"Yes, the spatial power in his body had almost been completely stripped away by Li Hao and used to break Tian Fang's teleportation channel.Following that, a great battle broke out. Without the river of time and space teleportation ... It would be difficult to escape.One question after another was raised by everyone.At this moment, Li Hao looked a little lazy. He leaned in the air, thought for a while, and said with a smile,""All good things must come to an end! Today, the situation in the chaos is completely clear!""Let's not talk about the grade-9 cultivators who haven't descended. There are only spring and autumn in the south, new martial in the East, and huntian in the West!""There are also many rank 8s gathered here. With so many of them dead ... Everyone's status has risen! "Today, new martial arts has dominated the East, annihilated the rebels, and completely gained a firm foothold ... New martial arts and silver Moon are, after all, a strip of water. I have some friendship with human King and Zhi Zun. If you are interested ... I can introduce you!"Everyone's expression changed.Kong Ji frowned,"Hao Yue, what are you saying?" At this point, could it be that if your strength declined, we would leave? [We've come from all over the world together. We've come this far because of you ... If we leave now, wouldn't we be laughed at?] If there's something good, we'll be there, but if we encounter any difficulties, we'll just leave. Isn't that a motley crew?"

"It's just that you've lost time ... Since you're willing to give up and dare to give up, I believe that you'll have a chance to rise again!"Kong Ji said in a deep voice,"what you lack now is just some energy. With enough energy and enough understanding of Tao techniques, you can at least have the power of 5000 to 6000 Dao laws even if you can't recover your previous strength ... At most, we can each gather some and destroy some worlds. At least you have a helper. Otherwise, do you expect Qian Wuliang and the other Level 7 experts to support you?"Li Hao meant to disband!Yes, everyone came from different places.On Silver moon's side, Li Hao had never said that he was going to be the boss. From now on, everyone would be on the same side, and they would come together if they got along, and leave if they did not.But even if they did, it couldn't be now.If word got out, people would think that everyone was an ungrateful person!Li Hao laughed."I'm serious. I'm not trying to goad you. I'm just ... A little tired. Now that we've finally gotten rid of some trouble, if you follow me ... To be honest, I don't have the heart to fight for hegemony. If you follow me ... You'll miss some opportunities."He laughed."What I mean is that neo martial is still expanding and wiping out some worlds. This is also an opportunity for everyone!" Everyone's great Dao inspirations were very strong now, but the amount might not be enough. Now was an opportunity! Not just the various worlds, but also some of the rank 9 worlds that appeared before. Most of them are still here ... Moreover, as the rank 8 worlds among them come out, they are at their weakest!""Huntian and Tian Fang are now looking for a new world. They don't have time to care about it. As for neo martial ... They will definitely not give up this opportunity!"Li Hao said seriously,"what I mean is, we can't let neo martial take all the food for himself!" "As for spring and autumn ... They also have a few level eights under them, but they're afraid of me and neo martial artists. Even if they want to snatch, they might not be able to snatch them from neo martial artists ... Take advantage of this now, everyone, move with neo martial artists ... There are still many opportunities!"Everyone's eyes flickered.Kong Ji raised his brows slightly,'you mean, we ... Should follow neo martial arts and get some free time? After that, we can seize some energy for you to recuperate ... That's fine too!"Li Hao waved his hand and smiled,"you don't need to worry about me. It's fine as long as you're strong!" If you can become stronger, to me ... It can also be considered as having one of my worries resolved! You've all been with me for a long time and helped me a lot, but to be honest ... A large group of people waiting to be fed ... I'm tired as a young man ..."Everyone was a little embarrassed.However, he had to admit that Li Hao had gained a lot in the past few years, but he had given up most of the benefits.Therefore, all of the level 8s that had been born were Li Hao's subordinates.One had to know that before this ... Be it Wu Shan or the Thunder Emperor, none of them had reached level eight.And now?A group of level 8! Hearing Li Hao's words, they felt a little embarrassed, but also a little hesitant. We're leaving ... Your side is too dangerous!Qian Wuliang?Qian Wuliang's two DAOs combined into one didn't mean that he was weak. Even if he wasn't as strong as them, the gap wouldn't be too big. But ... Was this guy reliable?He was the master of the Silver Moon! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If he felt that Li Hao was in his way ... Would he betray Qian Wuliang? As if he had sensed their thoughts ... Qian Wuliang was speechless."Stop it!"Do I dare?Not to mention that Li Hao isn't weak now, even if he really falls below the seventh step, I don't dare to rebel!Unless Li Hao is dead ... Fine, even if he is dead, I might not dare to do so. Unless he has been dead for a very, very long time. Then ... That is a possibility. Otherwise, why are you all looking at me?Li Hao laughed."Really. Don't worry about me. I'll think of a way. I'm not stupid. If I'm not confident, I'll just be waiting for death. "While it's still relatively quiet, and I'm not too interested, I'm bringing everyone around. The human King is full of energy ... With him around, I'm also at ease! He would use this opportunity to completely destroy the foundations of tier 9! This way, everyone will have a chance to advance further. Not just you ... Silvermoon and the others ... It's time for you to leave!""At first, because everyone was too young and did not have enough enlightenment, and unlike me, we lacked an opportunity like mine. But now, with a period of enlightenment in the heavenly Daoist temple and the energy of the creator God, I dare not say that everyone can enter Level Seven or eight, but at least, most of them can!""What about you?"Lin Hongyu, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke,""You're going to stay here alone? "If neo martial leaves, we'll leave too. Once huntian or Tian Fang's clone enters this place ... You'll be ... In too much danger!"It was actually good to go out!But what about Li Hao?Li Hao smiled."I'll just find a random place and cultivate in seclusion. The chaos is so big. Do you think it's so easy to find me?" I'm safe being all alone ..."At this moment, Kong Ji suddenly said,"then ... Then there's no need to cooperate with neo martial. We'll do it alone!" Now, there are not many chaos powerhouses. No matter how powerful new martial is, it is impossible to annihilate all the enemies immediately. Why don't we do it alone ... Spring and autumn may not dare to find trouble with us. We have many tier 8 powerhouses, so we are not afraid of them! "Self-sufficiency ... Maybe it's better than cooperating with neo martial. On neo martial's side, the human King is used to monopolizing everything ... Even if it's divided, it's divided among the neo martial artists. We might not have a chance."He looked at Li Hao."If you really want to go into seclusion, that's fine too. Don't worry about Silver Moon. We'll help you bring them out and bring them back in one piece!"

Chapter 3769 Villain (3)
He paused for a moment."It's just that ... You're in seclusion. If you absorb energy, I'm worried that you'll cause too much of a commotion and be discovered. By then ... It'll be troublesome."Now, things were different from before.Without Shi Guang, it would be very difficult for Li Hao to escape.On their side, the Dao chess pieces didn't have the ability to teleport. Once they were far away, it would be too late to come to their aid!Once someone got close to Li Hao, he would be finished.Whether it was huntian or Tian Fang's clone, neither of them was a match for Li Hao. There was also Spring Autumn ... He had to be on guard!"It's fine. I'm not that stupid. "Li Hao laughed."I won't stop you if you go alone. The human King ... Is right. He's very biased. If you really go, you might not get many benefits. If you go alone, there are many level 8s among you ... Keep an eye on those level 9 worlds, deal with them one by one, and devour one. That will be enough for you to become much stronger! "This time, there are at least 20 rank Nine Worlds. The human King destroyed the yin-yang world and the spring and autumn destroyed the life and death world, but there are still many left ..."Even if three to five of these people were distributed, it would be enough to fill their stomachs!At this time, Qian Wuliang thought for a while and said,"Lord Marquis, if you devour a complete rank nine world ... Can you ... Return to your previous peak?"From the sound of it, they were prepared to fight!Since Lord Marquis doesn't want to move, why don't we Silver Moon people go and do something? if possible ... We naturally have to help Li Hao recover his peak battle strength.Otherwise...Once the ninth rank descended in the future, what could they do?Moreover, in their eyes, Li Hao was more talented than the human King. As for the future, Li Hao had given them time that he didn't want ... No matter how strong they were, they were still taking advantage of Li Hao. However, if Li Hao were to lose his luster, the Silver Moon Warriors would not be able to stand it.Li Hao gave a faint smile."It's the best result that you don't make me worry. Take care of yourself. The Great War is not far away!" There are too many people who don't like me after the descent of a tier 9. If you were still this strong at that time ... I can only say that you'd better stay away from me!""In addition, the chaos great Dao here is in turmoil. It won't last long!"Li Hao calculated for a moment."At most, one year, at least half a year, and peace may be restored ... But you have very limited time. Of course, even if peace is restored, they may not be able to descend smoothly in a short time!""No matter what, even if they descend directly, they will still have the power of a peak rank eight!""I hope that you can participate in such a battle in the future ... Even if you can 't, you have some confidence in escaping from them. Otherwise, it will be difficult!"Everyone was deep in thought. Did Li Hao mean that he was confident?But everyone was puzzled.Where did the energy come from?Li Hao did absorb some energy in the New World, but most of it was from comprehending the great Dao. He didn't absorb too much energy. He wanted to recover, but he didn't participate in the battle of world destruction ... Was he hoping that the chaos great Dao would provide him with energy? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  But now, a group of grade-9 cultivators were guarding him!If he wanted to absorb chaotic energy, he had to first pass through those ninth-rank barriers. Despite his confusion, he understood what Li Hao meant.It's fine as long as you're strong!It was a good thing that he didn't drag them down.There was no need to worry about him, he had his own way.On second thought, he didn't need to worry. Even if Li Hao wasn't strong, he was very smart.After a while, Qian Wuliang said,""If you're fine, Lord Marquis, then we're willing to follow senior kongji and the others to wipe out the chaos. We'll do our best not to embarrass you, Lord Marquis!"Speaking of this, he laughed again."There are many strong neo martial artists, many of them are at the eighth level. And what you mean is that we'll have to wait for the strong ones from the future world to come out. Last time, I vaguely saw some. Among them ... I'm afraid there are many seventh level venerable sovereigns!"It wasn't just a few, it was quite a lot.Seventh rank!Many of the innate gods had already reached this level.Of course, in reality, it was also them.In fact, they had all sensed the power of a level 7. If the future one could unify the chaos, he would definitely not be weaker than these innate gods. He would only be stronger and might have many Level 7 and 8 subordinates.There were many Level seven and eight neo martial artists because they were a thousand years earlier. However, if they came later and had more experts under their command than Li Hao ... Then everyone would be embarrassed.Even though the flow of time in their world was faster, there was only so much energy in general.On the other hand, chaos had many opportunities."There's no need to compete ... Of course, it's up to you!"Li Hao waved his hand."Let's go. It's still quiet and safe now. If you have such thoughts, it's also an opportunity.Any later and it would be difficult.Although the others were worried about Li Hao, they still said,""Since you've already made up your mind, we won't probe any further. However, if there's anything you need, just let us know at any time. Even though there's no longer any space teleportation, I believe that you'll still have a way to deal with it!""Don't worry!"Seeing this, everyone stopped talking.They didn't know Li Hao's plan, but they knew that Li Hao wanted to be alone for a while. After some consideration, Qian Wuliang interrupted,"Since Lord Marquis wants some peace and quiet ... Why don't you let Black Panther stay and help you with some chores? Black Panther can contact Silver Moon world and inform us at any time. What do you think, Lord Marquis?"Li Hao glanced at the Black Panther, who was still in its original form ... But had already become a level Seven venerable sovereign!
