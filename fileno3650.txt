(I can't write anymore)The chaos was endless.It was vast, mysterious, and huge.However, when one became familiar with chaos, one would actually feel empty, boring, and cold.The chaos had always been cold and cheerless.A world in the chaos was just a drop in the ocean. Everything would end before it left the chaos. It could not affect the chaos in any way.The worlds that lived in the northern region would not think that they were in the North.The so-called North, South, East, and West were only the divisions of the strong.To the chaos and the world, being able to clearly distinguish the surrounding small domains was the limit. Some venerable sovereigns might not even be able to walk out of a small domain in their entire lives.The nine Heavens of chaos!Now, Li Hao understood that it was established by the master of order in the past. Unfortunately, it seemed to be incomplete, and the nine Heavens were not completely separated ... The true situation of the nine Heavens was that it was abandoned halfway.Therefore, his judgment back then was correct. This was indeed the orthodoxy of a Supreme expert. It was just a pity that he couldn't complete it.If it was completed, perhaps the chaos would be calmer and more orderly.The difference between the strong and the weak might be clearer, which would give the weak more opportunities.Since it involved the entire chaos, one could imagine that the master of order in the past was not weak. In fact, he was very strong!As for why he was killed and who killed him, tianfang and the Tribulation might have all been participants. The current huntian probably inherited the will and orthodoxy of order.In the North, the deeper he went, the stronger the power of the five elements became.Walking in the chaos, Li Hao sensed the subtle change and fell into deep thought. The five elements Dominators were not weak, but they were only average among the other Dominators.In the North, however, the power of the five elements was so strong ... It should be known that all the places were cultivating the five elements, so it did not make sense that the five elements here were stronger than those in other directions.Unless...There was a spirit of the five elements great Dao here!Spirits were exclusive to rank nine venerable sovereigns.There seemed to be a five-element Dao master among the rank-nine Dao Masters. Did that mean that ... The world of the five-element Dao master might be the current world of five elements?Of course, it was possible that this was not the case. However, the five-element Dao Lord's world could also exist in the North ...Those silent worlds, tier 9 worlds, didn't any of them rise up in the past million years?On this trip, Li Hao had also disguised himself. His face was blurred, and his body seemed to be overflowing with intelligence. It was difficult for those who were not omnipotent to see him. There was a source of chaos outside his body.Of course, he also tried his best to hide it ... If a true level 9 expert were to descend, he would not be so overbearing, but would instead be very careful.He had to act well.He wasn't pretending to be the path master of chaos to deal with rank nines. He just hoped to confuse huntian and the others, but he had to avoid direct conflict with them as much as possible. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ The chaos was huge, and Li Hao had never really traveled much. This time, he wasn't flustered or in a hurry. He walked and stopped, and even though it was dark ... He still felt a little relaxed.When he was young and had just started learning martial arts, this was perhaps his biggest dream. He wanted to be alone in the world with his sword.Life's trifles, responsibilities, and war had turned all these dreams into bubbles.Now, Li Hao could no longer keep track of time after entering the chaos. It had been five years since he entered the chaos. He could no longer remember the passage of time. The chaos did not have a unified calendar to keep track of this.It was too big, and no one had unified it. Naturally, there was no publicly acknowledged chaos calendar.Five years, in the blink of an eye.At the age of 20, he had stepped into the Martial Master realm. At the age of 23, he had completed the unification of the Silver Moon ... Although those few years were short, they had been extremely fulfilling. As for the five years of chaos, other than killing people, he had been killing people and wandering around ...He didn't have a fixed residence. It wasn't the martial world that he had imagined.This world ... Was not that exciting." 28?"Li Hao, after thinking for a while, he realized that he was ... 28 years old.The corners of his lips curled up slightly.To many people, this age was like a child.But to him, he might miss out on many things."Chaos has no time. What's a mere five years?" he said.,m Li Hao thought as he continued to move forward.Sometimes, it was a pity that this dark chaos was missing something. This place was not for ordinary people. Since it was not for ordinary people, and the people who walked here were all venerable sovereigns ... It was missing some of the bullying and tyrannical things in the novels.I'm a swordsman, wandering the pugilistic world, but I can't even be a hero saving a beauty. I'm a little regretful.They were all venerable sovereigns, who would do such a thing?What a pity!He was alone, and there were no acquaintances around. As he walked, he felt relaxed and bored. Li Hao wanted to find someone to walk with. A stranger was good, but he was afraid that strangers would not dare to walk with strangers.And now, the heavenly Daoist Rite had not been established in the North.This place was not as lively as the East.In the East, there were many people coming and going at the entrances of some secret realms. Many venerable sovereigns were talking and laughing. The most chaotic East was the most lively place.The higher-ups were fighting, but the middle and lower-levels were discussing the Dao in high spirits. The atmosphere in the entire East was very strange.The North ... Was completely deserted."The human King said to set up a sky screen, a ranking list, a live broadcast or a recorded broadcast, and play it on loop every day. Perhaps...It makes sense. This way, at least we will know where the lively places are and where we can get information ..."At this moment, he started to seriously study the human King's suggestion.

Chapter 3651 Chaos Befalls (1)
It was actually pretty good!In this uninhabited chaos, a sky screen could be used as a guide. It was not a bad idea. The chaos was so big that it was still okay for the strong, but the weak could really get lost.After walking for a while, Li Hao sensed that he had sensed a Beast of Chaos instead of a human.There weren't many chaos beasts in the outer region.Unlike the four-sided domain, which had many of them.The Beasts of Chaos here were either captured or killed. Humans were too powerful here and it was difficult for the Beasts of Chaos to survive. Peng Cheng from the West was considered an Overlord of the Beasts of Chaos but he only had around 4000 Dao laws."Our luck is not bad. We actually encountered a living creature. At least ... It's alive."Li Hao laughed and quickly disappeared.……In the chaos.A huge beast was walking silently.Suddenly, his ears quivered.He seemed to have sensed something.In an instant, his expression changed.What?In an instant, a person appeared in front of him. His face was a little illusionary, and he said,""Fellow Daoist, do you mind travelling with us?"The huge Beast of Chaos 'body instantly stiffened.It was not weak!On the contrary, if it was an expert, the chaos beasts that dared to travel alone in the chaos were not weak.However, at this moment ... He felt a little suffocated.It knew that it had encountered a peerless expert!Who was it?It was a rank seven Chaos Beast, but the other party appeared instantly without any warning. It was at least a rank eight, or even stronger.He was somewhat trembling!"Senior ..." Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao looked at him. This was a fierce tiger. At this moment, its frightened appearance reminded him of his own spirit, a Tiger out of its cage. However, his spirit had been destroyed together with the spirit of the calamity."Don't be afraid. "Li Hao comforted him with a smile."It's too lonely to travel alone. I've been away from this place for too long and am not familiar with the chaos. Find a living creature, chat with it, and travel together. It'll be more lively."What did that mean?The giant Tiger was a little confused.What did he mean by ... He had left this place for many years and did not understand the chaos?He didn't quite understand!This sentence ... I don't quite understand. Could it be that you have left the chaos? it thought in its heart, a little confused ...As for Li Hao, seeing that it was confused, he sighed in his heart. What a stupid Tiger.I actually just wanted to say that I'm a ninth-rank beast who left the primordial chaos ... But from the expression of this stupid Tiger, it seems that it didn't understand. The primordial chaos Beast is still lacking in something."Fellow Daoist, do you mind telling me your name?"Li Hao didn't mind and asked casually.In the primordial chaos, beasts of primordial chaos liked to travel everywhere. Therefore, he had to know more about the various places. It just so happened that he could find a beast of primordial chaos and ask.Seventh-rank strength!He was not weak. Among the chaos beasts, they were considered strong."I ... Am called Flying Tiger!"This Tiger was a little different from ordinary demons. It had eight wings and was different from the Tigers of the demon clan.However, even though the Tiger head was huge, it still looked like a tiger.Li Hao had once killed Black Tiger's cultivation partner in the square domain. That White Tiger ... I wonder if he's considered a relative of this person?Compared to the black Tiger, this fierce tiger looked more cowardly ... He didn't know if it was because the chaos beasts on long Zhan's side were smarter, or if it was because they lacked the stupidity of chaos beasts.They were all very smart. The fire Phoenix sovereign was even smarter than humans. Of course, he was killed by Li Hao in the end.Li Hao actually didn't like smart people.It was better to be a little stupid.Smart people actually didn't like the people around them to be smart too. If they were all very smart, how would they reflect their own shrewdness and intelligence?"Flying Tiger?""My name is chaos!" Li Hao nodded and smiled."Senior chaos!"The Tiger hurriedly called out.Li Hao was speechless. You ... Forget it. This person probably hasn't even heard of a Daoist name of the ninth stage. Perhaps he only knows Tian Fang, or perhaps he doesn't even know Tian Fang.He was really a shut-in seventh-rank."Are you a Beast of Chaos native to the North?"Li Hao naturally jumped up and rode the Tiger!It was just so natural.He was very polite with his words, saying that he was bored and wanted to walk with Him since they were fellow Daoists. But in fact ... He was not polite at all. A seventh-level Beast of Chaos could be considered an Overlord anywhere, but here ... Li Hao could ride it whenever he wanted.He was also a little excited. He had wanted to ride a Black Panther for a long time, but unfortunately, it was a dog. Li Hao had always felt that riding a dog wasn't impressive enough.Second cat was strong. Riding a cat?That would be even more embarrassing!The Tiger was still better. It was majestic. Riding on the Tiger would have the taste of a Jianghu person.Comfortable!Hmm, this fur ... Is soft. It only has eight wings, which is a little troublesome. However, this fierce tiger is too big, and the eight wings are on both sides. There are also some gaps, so there is no need to worry about not being enough for riding.The flying Tiger was slightly uncomfortable.Was he being ridden?Alright ... I don't think I can afford to offend him.Up until now, it had not sensed the other party's specific strength. It was too strong and not someone it could provoke."Do you know where the world of five elements is?"Li Hao asked.The Tiger nodded its huge head, as if it had accepted its fate.""Yes, I do. They are the overlords of this place, and they are very powerful! In the nine Heavens ... Many of our fellow Daoists were captured by them. They're very powerful ...""They also capture chaos beasts?""Catch him.""Then isn't it very dangerous for you to be here? Why don't you go to the four regions and join long Zhan?"The Tiger was stunned for a moment and shook his head.""That won't do. Long Zhan is a Dragon, and I am a Tiger. As the chaos race, there's an ancient saying that when a Dragon and a Tiger Meet, one will definitely be injured. There's also an old saying, when a Dragon and a Tiger fight ..."

Chapter 3652 Chaos Befalls (3)
“……”Li Hao almost laughed. What old saying?Where did this Tiger hear all this from?"His goal is to strengthen the primal Chaos race. He also has the Tiger race under his command ...""Then I won't go either."The flying Tiger shook its head."I also heard that it's very dangerous there. There are murderers everywhere. The neo martial human King and the Silver Moon King are all murderous Devils ... They were skinned and eaten before they even reached the place!"“……”Li Hao was speechless. How could I be on the same level as the human Emperor?I've always been kind to others!It's normal for a human King to be unparalleled in killing. My reputation is still good, right?"I know the neo martial human King. He kills a lot, but I've also heard a thing or two about the Silver Moon King. It's said that he's kind to people and even opened a heavenly Daoist field to discuss Dao with people and spread the Dao of chaos ... He's not as brutal as you say, right?"The Tiger hurriedly said,"senior, you might not know or understand, but you must not go there ... Be careful not to be confused!" The more you bite, the less you bark. This Silver Moon King might not seem as famous as a human King, but the people he has killed are even more...Extremely brutal!"Li Hao gave a faint smile.Was it?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Your old words ... Are all very familiar. This Tiger, has it mixed with the human race?However, he still felt a little silly.p Since I've already said so, shouldn't any normal person be guessing whether I have any relationship with the Silver Moon King?A seventh level venerable sovereign didn't even have such a reaction ... No wonder it could only be hearsay and slander.From this, it could be seen that the spirits of the chaos race were indeed getting fewer and fewer.It was a little strange that this guy could enter grade seven."Do you eat people? You're actually at the seventh step ... Did you eat people to reach that level?"The smell of blood on this Tiger's body didn't seem to be too strong.Li Hao was a little confused.The ferocious Tiger shook its head,"why would I eat people?" As the old saying goes, the human race is the filthiest. There are schemes and filth everywhere. If you want to eat, you have to eat chaotic force. If the chaos race doesn't eat chaotic force, then they're very filthy ..."“……”A weirdo!Li Hao chuckled. Eating people is filthy?Fine, he didn't like man-eating Beasts of Chaos, but when a Beast of Chaos said that eating people was very dirty because humans were the dirtiest ... Li Hao actually wanted to give it a beating.Look at me, do I look like a human?You're speaking like this in front of a human powerhouse. Have you forgotten something?Where did this stupid Tiger come from? it's not easy to live to this day."You've never been captured by human experts?""No... They can't catch me. I have eight wings. I can fly, and I can fly very fast!" The flying Tiger seemed to be a little proud."I tore through the void and disappeared instantly. Even a rank-8 human can't catch me ..."As she said this, she seemed to have recalled something. I ... Seemed to have been caught by someone?Right?I almost forgot."Senior is very fast, even faster than me. You're simply the fastest in the world ..."Li Hao laughed again."Cut the crap. It doesn't matter if you're slow when you fly to the world of five elements." Other than the five elements Overlord, are there any other experts in the five elements realm?""There used to be five level 8s, but now there are only three left. A few days ago, it was said that the Overlord of the South came and killed one, leaving only three. Oh, it seems that a few level 8s escaped from the East. I heard it from some passing venerable sovereigns. It was said that they were all killed by the demon kings of the east ... The East is terrible. A bunch of level 8s died, and I heard that even level 9s died ..."Ninth-rank?The Tiger was stunned. That's right, what rank is the one on my back?Level eight?Or ... Ninth-grade?It can't be ninth-rank, right?All of a sudden, she felt a little scared.At this moment, Li Hao couldn't help but sigh and say softly,""The spirits of the chaos race are much less. Long Zhan is biased and pulled many spirits to the four regions. The chaos race over there has more spirits ..."In other words, you're a little stupid.It wasn't easy to reach grade seven.Not bad!He didn't know if the Tiger understood, but at this moment, it didn't care much about this and casually said,""I actually know long Zhan too. I met him once many years ago and he wanted to take me away. I ignored him and he wanted to catch me. In the end, I ran fast. He's a dragon without wings, how can he be faster than me!"Li Hao laughed again.A Dragon with wings ... Was called a lizard.Of course, it didn't matter.It's very likely that long Zhan just doesn't want to really catch you, otherwise ... Where would you run to?Riding on this Tiger, Li Hao felt a little more comfortable. He didn't have to travel by himself, and he also had the stupid Tiger to chat with. It was less boring.As they chatted, they learned about the specific situation in the North.The Overlord of the North was indeed the world of five elements.However, there was not only one powerful faction in the North. For example, there were many rank 8 worlds outside of Samsara.In the North, there were a few level 8 worlds.Some were not weak either.The world of five elements was the Overlord of the North in name, but in fact, it had not really unified the North. Of course, the powerhouses in the North all acknowledged that the five elements were the strongest. Under normal circumstances, even if the world of five elements could not mobilize these powerhouses to do things, the other worlds would not stop them.Speaking of this, Li Hao suddenly thought of something and asked,""You've been wandering in the chaos for many years, absorbing chaotic force everywhere, and it's pure chaotic force. Do you know if there are any silent great worlds in the chaos that might be in a closed state, but the energy in the surroundings is very rich?"This big tiger had been absorbing chaotic force all over the place, and he had come out this time to absorb it.

Chapter 3653 Chaos Befalls (3)
According to what it said, chaotic force had its own differences between purity and non-purity.Some places were delicious, and some were not. It had lived for a long time, otherwise it would not have reached the seventh level. It ate everywhere and had actually walked through many places, but most of them were in the northern region."Great world? Sealed?"The Tiger thought for a moment and said after a long time,""I think I did, but ... It's been so many years, so I don't really remember. There was once when I encountered a world like the one senior spoke of. The chaotic force around me was frighteningly dense. There was a world, but no one cared about me when I absorbed some chaotic force ... So I absorbed a little more."Anyway, no one cared.It was not interested in devouring the world, so when it saw that no one cared about it, it absorbed a little more and ran away.It was many years ago.In the end, he wanted to go there again ... But he couldn't find it. He didn't know if he was lost or if the other world had run away.Li Hao raised his eyebrows.It might really be a type 9 world, but ... Fortunately, this fellow was not greedy. The other party might have gone silent, but once the Tiger went to devour the world, there might be experts who would recover.A rank seven Chaos Beast, not to mention what it was like in the past, even now, if it encountered a rank nine world, it would be killed instantly.He couldn't remember where the other party was ... Li Hao was somewhat regretful.Stupid fellow!It seemed that he had missed such a world. Otherwise, he could go and take a look first.Today's level nine world might not be as strong as the elemental world.There were a total of eight level eight venerable sovereigns in the world of five elements, and they were not weak either. There were at least six to seven thousand traces of the Golden Spirit venerable, one of the overlords of the five elements.If the five-element emissaries joined forces, they would not be weaker than an expert with 7000 Dao laws.……On the way, he chatted with the flying Tiger.The other party's speed was indeed not slow, and he was also quite vigilant. He would avoid any major world he encountered. No wonder he could survive until now.Gradually, Li Hao felt the power of the five elements getting stronger and stronger.It seemed that the world of five elements was not far away.Since Li Hao had nothing to do, he closed his eyes and began to cultivate on the tiger's back. Divine runes appeared one after another, surprising the flying Tiger. It was the first time it had seen such things, and it was envious.The things that experts cultivated were naturally good.Unfortunately, the flying Tiger didn't recognize the divine text that Li Hao had conjured. It was a little anxious and only realized that it was probably the so-called language of the human race after trying to recognize it ...Unfortunately, it would not.If I had known earlier, I would have learned some words. I missed the opportunity this time.However, the flying Tiger wasn't afraid of death. It took the risk to ask Li Hao about the meaning of some words and happily went to comprehend them. It didn't know if it could comprehend anything, but it had an idea ... It could read some books when it was free. It would be good to learn some words.Li Hao was also curious and didn't mind answering some of the flying Tiger's questions.A human and a Tiger got along quite well.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  ……While Li Hao was heading to the five elements realm.In the chaos.At this moment, in an extremely chaotic region of Primal Chaos energy, Primal Chaos energy began to tremble. After a long time, the void trembled.Countless Primal Chaos energy gathered.A moment later, a person appeared. After sensing his surroundings, he was in a good mood."Hundun ... I'm back!"It had been too long.A million years.He had been there all this time, interacting with a group of powerhouses. He wasn't considered strong among the type 9 powerhouses, and he was actually still very aggrieved. Today, he had finally returned!And ... His true body had returned!This was not a clone.The chaos path master was getting a little excited. Even though his combat power had yet to recover to its peak and was not as strong as it had been in the past, it was still enough for the current chaos."I need to keep a low profile ..."He mumbled to himself. It was better to keep a low profile.The current chaos was too high-profile due to its lack of spirituality. It was not a good thing. Tian Fang and the others had made a high-profile return, but in the end ... They returned in defeat and even lost their avatars.He couldn't learn from them. Moreover, he didn't have Tian Fang's capital. Tian Fang's previous clones might have been stronger than him. The chaos was not chaotic enough!The more chaotic it was, the stronger he would be.He looked up into the sky and smiled. His face became illusory and the power of Chaos was retracted. He looked around ... He couldn't go to the East. There were a few ruthless people there!He couldn't go to the West. Order was against him, and huntian wasn't weak.South or North?He thought about it ... North!The five elements Daoist master was on the other side. He had come to the primordial chaos to discuss with the tier-9 experts that he would be able to get in touch with, and that they would all come to help him. The five elements Overlord in the North ... Had a very close relationship with the five elements Daoist master.The two sides should have some connections ... The North was a suitable place for him to establish his base!"Don't forget ... To contact the cultivators of chaos as soon as possible ..."He seemed to be mumbling to himself, but also seemed to be reminding those grade-9 experts.Don't forget your promise!Otherwise, I might not be able to help you.……Deep in the chaos great Dao.At this moment, all the grade 9 cultivators were trying to contact their inheritors or the powerful beings of the world they had left behind.Chaos descended!"Temporarily listen to The Order of Chaos, establish a foothold in chaos, contend against the few overlords, and help chaos. At the same time ... Keep an eye on chaos, in case chaos takes the benefits and doesn't work.Everyone was still hoping for chaos to create greater chaos and give everyone a chance to return.This included Tian Fang's master. At this moment, he was also contacting Wuxing through his own method. This time, his clone had been killed, and Tian Fang world had been devoured by the neo martial. The entire Tian Fang had suffered heavy losses. Only Wuxing and Coiling Dragon were left of the level 8.

Chapter 3654 Chaos Befalls (1)_5
Coiling Dragon, there was a high probability that long Zhan would subdue it ... And now, the news only needed to be passed to the five elements. As for Coiling Dragon, forget it, to prevent the news from being leaked.……Five elements realm.Although there was no fighting going on in the vast realm, the atmosphere was a bit tense. The new members of the five elements were no weaklings. Although they had come to seek refuge ... They wanted to turn the tables!As for the remaining three Five Element overlords, they needed the help of these five people to fight against the other three forces.On the one hand, he actually had other thoughts ... For example, he wanted to devour them!Of course, these five people were, after all, cultivators from tianfang world. In fact, the five elements overlords were somewhat afraid of them and did not dare to act rashly for fear of provoking the master of tianfang's revenge. Although he had lost before, it did not mean that he would not return.If they did, they would be in big trouble.In such a complicated environment.Supreme Emperor golden sun's eyes suddenly flickered. The others also sensed something and were instantly ecstatic!It seemed to be ... Dao master!The Dao master was actually able to send some information back. The chaos great Dao seemed to appear in the entire void. It was faintly discernible, allowing them to sense something."The true body of chaos has descended ... I'll listen to The Order of Chaos for the time being and help chaos to gain a firm foothold and seize more spirits!"The few of them naturally recognized the chaos Emperor, but of course, he was not too conspicuous among the rank nines.However, it was still a Grade 9!All of a sudden, they were excited. Ever since their path master's clone had been killed, Tian Fang had been exterminated, and Li Hao had driven him to the North, they had been very nervous. But now, although they were not their own path master, it was obvious that the chaos was the will of all the level nine experts!It was as if he had suddenly found a backbone!"The chaos path master has returned!"Jinyang was overjoyed!Huo Yan was also delighted,'this means that the rank nine Dao Masters didn't just sit back and watch them grow! However, Dao master's meaning is ... He hopes that we can keep an eye on the chaos ... In case he makes it big?""It should be!""In any case, with a level 9 in person, even if he doesn't have enough spirituality and can't display the true power of a level 9, he's no weaker than huntian. He's definitely stronger than the human King and Li Hao!"The few of them were still extremely happy!At this moment, Huo Yan suddenly looked in another direction and said in a low voice,"This world of five elements ... Is it related to the five elements Dao master? If it's related, he might have received some information now ... In that case ... Should we ... Temporarily give up on the plan to take over the world of five elements?"Jinyang frowned slightly. After a moment, she said,""I'm not too sure. I'm not sure if he's related to the five-element Dao master, but ... We can wait! Since the chaos path master has arrived, he'll most likely come to the North to establish himself. The other three are not suitable for him to do so!" "If he comes, he can decide whether to kill these people or not ... He won't have to worry about killing the wrong people ... And it won't bring any trouble to the Dao master."The five elements path master was not weak. Although he was not as strong as the sky Fang master, he was still an expert among the type 9 experts.If he killed his men, it might bring him some trouble.At this moment, the few of them felt at ease.At this moment, the wood element Messenger also revealed a smile,"Li Hao hoped that we could enter the North. He probably had the same idea. He wanted us to fight with the people of the elemental realm and at the same time, resist the invasion of the huntian realm and the spring and autumn realm. But he didn't expect ..." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "He would never have thought that a tier 9 would be more powerful and decisive than he imagined. A true tier 9 would descend so quickly!"When they talked about Li Hao, they hated him to the bone!He was even more resentful than long Zhan and the human King.Although Li Hao had saved their lives, in their eyes, Li Hao ... Owed them.Li Hao had once comprehended Tian Fang's Dao. If not for Li Hao, how could they have been defeated so quickly?In the end, they still had to owe Li Hao a favor ... And the so-called favor was not killing them.As the wood element Messenger spoke, he looked at Huo Yan and Shui Linglong with a bit of anger,"If I had known this would happen, the two of you wouldn't have helped him ..."The fire Yan Thearch sighed."It's not about whether you want to help him or not. He's just walking over to listen to his teachings. Do you want to tell him or not? actually ... It doesn't matter much. If you help him, you'll at least owe him a favor. At least ... We're still alive, right?"Back then, even if he didn't lend Li Hao his power, would he still be the Li Hao He is today?That might not be the case!There were some things that were hard to say.,m Now, at least all five of them were still alive, and at least they had used the favor.Five level 8 experts!Back then, he had only borrowed some of Li Hao's strength, so he wasn't too strong. But now, he had managed to save the lives of five level 8 martial artists. In fact, Huo Yan felt that ... It wasn't necessarily a loss. No matter how evil and cold-blooded Li Hao was, the five of them were still here.At this moment, the Earth Spirit emissary also said,"there's no need to mention these things anymore. It's meaningless!" If we want to take revenge ... We probably can't do it, but the arrival of the chaos path master will definitely cause chaos!""Li Hao cultivated time, and now he can't control it. He's also a powerful enemy of a level 9 ... There's still a chance for revenge!"The few of them looked at each other and nodded.They had lived there for a very long time and knew very well that time was the most important thing compared to others. Thus, the chaos path master must have taken on some missions.This included dealing with Li Hao and seizing time. It must be one of the missions!

"I just don't know when the chaos path master will come ... He hasn't returned to the primordial chaos for many years. I'm worried that he'll wander around before coming back. That'll be a waste of time.""It's hard to say, but it won't be long. Just wait!"“……” When the emissaries talked about this, they all smiled.……At the same time.At this moment, some of the destroyed worlds and some of the hidden worlds in the primordial chaos were stirring.The cultivators seemed to have heard something.Soon, some people were happy, while others were sad.Chaos had descended!Unfortunately ... He wasn't their Dao master.Otherwise, it would be a joyous occasion if his true body descended.However, it was a good thing that they seemed to have reached an agreement with the chaos Dao master, which allowed them to listen to The Order of Chaos for the time being and cause chaos to erupt!At this moment, people began to leave the mountain and head north.Currently, although it was still unclear where chaos would establish itself ... The North was the most suitable place. Second, the five elements path was located there, and the five elements Overlord and five elements path master might have some connections. Where else could they go if not the North?If he went there, he might be able to directly subdue eight grade 8 experts!Such a Foundation was still very strong.……At another location.In the West.A mirror appeared in front of huntian Supreme Emperor, showing the scene of the nine Heavens. After a long time, the mirror trembled and huntian Supreme Emperor frowned."I guessed that someone would descend soon. It seems like I was right. I just didn't expect chaos to descend!"Heaven and earth shook!The order was somewhat shaken.To be able to cause such an effect, it must be an opposing Dao, the Dao of chaos. The chaos Thearch had descended!He frowned slightly and quickly said,"that's good too, chaos isn't too strong among the tier 9 ..."However, he frowned and looked to the North.""So, the chaos might have gone to the North?" Beside him, the black shadow was also watching. After watching for a while, he whispered,""Path master, killing the chaos ... Might be more useful for us to establish order! His Dao had always been resisting the Dao of order! In recent years, the instability of order was related to chaos. Both sides restrained each other, causing signs of instability! The chaos this time might be our chance!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Huntian thought about it and nodded.That's right!Although the Dao of chaos was not too powerful, it was also the reason why order was established halfway. It restricted his development. However, if order collapsed, chaos was not weak among the level nine great Dao.And the chaos would definitely target him!"Path master, should we inform the others?""No!""No." Huntian shook his head."Chaos is the main body. Killing him will bring great benefits. It'll be beneficial for us to establish order. Once people find out ... Perhaps someone will stop us! Chaos isn't the peak right now. If my huntian realm goes all-out ... There's still a chance of killing him!"The black shadow said no more and quickly said,"then I ... Should go to the North to investigate?" If chaos's true body is discovered ... Daoist master, should we deal with it?""Okay, be careful, he's either going to the North or coming to our huntian domain! I won't be going to the East for the time being. ""Understood!"The black shadow didn't say much and quickly disappeared. At this moment, huntian was also a little conflicted. He was excited and uneasy.Ninth-rank!The key to becoming a true grade-9 was that it was the opposing Dao of order. The Dao of the two extremes had always been a symbol of power.On the other hand, order and chaos were extremely difficult to fuse. Furthermore, both paths had given birth to a rank nine path master, which was even more difficult.If they could kill chaos this time ...This was something that even the master of order had not been able to achieve back then.If he had killed chaos back then, perhaps ... There would have been a different chaos."Chaos ... The first one to come is actually you ..."He mumbled,"perhaps, you'll be the first tier 9 to fall completely!"At this moment, the chaos was once again stirred.However, not many people knew about it at the moment.Even the human King and the others, including Li Hao, didn't know that a ninth-rank true body had already arrived. In their opinion, this wasn't the best time. It was too risky for a ninth-rank true body to arrive when it didn't have enough spirituality!Li Hao, on the other hand, had never expected that ... He would also pretend to be the chaos path master and head to the five elements realm. The five elements realm was right in front of him.

Chapter 3656 The Opportunity Has Come (1)
Five elements realm.They were clearly divided.The power of the five elements filled heaven and earth. The entire world seemed to be colorful. In this dark chaos, such a world was actually very eye-catching.Fortunately, the five-element Dominators were still powerful. Otherwise, such an eye-catching world would have been killed long ago.Chaos was still about keeping a low profile.Outside the world of five elements.Li Hao watched and sensed in silence.It was a very powerful world.No wonder they could dominate the North. In addition to their own strength, there were three other eighth-order worlds outside the five elements realm. Of course, they were not too strong, only with one eighth-order cultivator.It surrounded the five elements realm.Thus, the Overlord force of the North was formed. As there were three rank eight worlds supporting it, it could be considered a subsidiary world, but ... It only had three more ordinary rank eight worlds.The flying Tiger was feeling uneasy."Senior, we're done, shall we go?"I'm scared!The aura of a rank eight world made it tremble.What was this senior doing here?Li Hao didn't say anything. He just calculated in silence. There were five of the five elements, three of the five elements overlords, and three other level 8 worlds nearby. There were 11 level 8s, not counting the level 7s.It was quite powerful!Although my current combat strength is as high as 7000 Dao laws, it'll still be difficult for me to kill them if they join forces against me.Of course, it was just difficult.If he didn't make any preparations, he wouldn't have sent Wuxing here.When the five paths came, it would be an opportunity. Eight grade 8s might not be stronger than three."Leave what?"Li Hao didn't mind teasing this stupid Tiger.""You will charge forward and attract the powerful warriors. I will kill a few of them. We will take over the world of five elements and change its name to the chaotic celestial world!""Ah?"The flying Tiger was instantly stunned.How would I dare!Although I'm not weak at the seventh step, but ... This is the five elements realm. There are a bunch of eighth step cultivators.The huge tiger head drooped instantly.The word "King" on his forehead collapsed and turned into a line. Don't scare a Tiger, it's quite scary."Senior ... I ... I think ...""Are you afraid?"The flying Tiger bared its fangs ... Was it afraid?Of course!Isn't this nonsense?I'm not a fool, I'm at least at the seventh step. This senior ... Does he think I'm a fool? At this moment, it didn't know what Li Hao was going to do, but it was scared.Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to be thinking of something as he continued to stare at the five elements realm.His teacher should be nearby.Of course, that was only for cultivators of the seventh step.It wouldn't be of much use in determining the outcome of the battle, but ... If used well, and coupled with his teacher's treachery and shamelessness, it might be of some use.This trip to seize the five elements was for himself and also for his teacher.Yuan Shuo was talented, but he had always been one step behind others ... Until today, his teacher had given up. This time, he probably came to the five elements realm to do something amazing, but unfortunately ... When he came to the five elements realm, his teacher would probably want to cry, right?Li Hao laughed at the thought."Chaotic ..."Li Hao fell into deep thought.He naturally had his own reasons for pretending to be chaos. Most of it was to ... Attract people from huntian or huntian itself."I don't know if I can lure them here ... Whether it's the five elements or the five elements Overlord, they're all related to tier 9. If I pretend to be chaos 'true body and descend ... Huntian definitely won't be able to sit still!""The premise is that he has to know that I'm here ..."Yes, his plan was to cause chaos in the entire North and get huntian involved.p Order and chaos were polar opposites.Huntian might not participate in other experts, but when it came to the essence of the great Dao, huntian would definitely participate. The most important thing now was to make huntian believe that chaos was really coming and that it was not someone pretending to be."I can't directly lay my hands on the five elements, but ... I have to make a gesture of peace and huntian will know ..."At this moment, he still didn't know that the real chaos had arrived.If he knew, he would probably be very happy.Even though he didn't know, he was prepared. He pretended to be chaotic with this intention. Even if chaos didn't come, he would still mess up the chaos heaven and five elements to make them suspicious.Huntian wanted to unify the chaos, so they would become enemies sooner or later. It was best to weaken such a person as much as possible.Huntian might not only have Peng Cheng and a few other grade eights.If the other party was the inheritance of the master of order, or perhaps ... He was simply the reincarnation of order, then didn't the master of order, who had almost unified chaos back then, have any manpower?The master of order was definitely not weak. Tian Fang and the rest had completely gotten rid of all the people from order?The last time he dealt with Tian Fang's clone, someone seemed to be spying on him. Was it someone from another tier 9 world or someone huntian had brought?All of this was unknown.A smile gradually appeared.Chaos heaven ... Order ... Chaos ... Five elements ...A thought emerged.A few plans also appeared in his mind."The five elements should have a chaotic understanding of each other ... It's not allowed to be in close contact, but it's allowed to be seen from a distance ... It's best if there are people from huntian nearby. This person has arranged many backup plans in the East, so how can there be no one in the North?"The flying Tiger stroked its head and shuddered. At that moment, it suddenly felt that the person on its back ... Was a little cold.It was a little different from before."Flying Tiger ... I'll ask you a question. Do you know who in the North has the most contact with huntian zone?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The flying Tiger was speechless.

Chapter 3657 The Opportunity Has Come (1)
What kind of test was this?"I don't know,"What a stupid Tiger!Of course, I don't know.But ... What did it matter?A chaotic aura gradually spread out and started to spread. Li Hao smiled.""Later, if anyone discovers anything, quickly escape and fly towards some rank 8 regions, understand?""I know."The flying Tiger was uneasy.What are you doing?He felt that it was very dangerous!The chaotic power merged with the chaos. The originally calm chaos began to ripple and gradually spread to the five elements realm in the distance.It was very weak!But ... It really existed.The weak might not be able to sense anything, but the strong would definitely be able to sense something different.It broke the weak Order of Chaos!In an instant, the five elements realm seemed to sense something. In an instant, several auras shook, as if they were scanning something.In the blink of an eye, the flying Tiger soared into the sky and disappeared, fleeing.They were frightened!Why?What was he doing?Why are you provoking him?What was this guy doing?……At that moment, several figures appeared in the five elements realm.Not only the five elements emissaries, but the five elements overlords also appeared, all somewhat bewildered.What was going on?When Supreme Emperor golden sun picked up a handful of great Dao energy fluctuating in the void, his expression instantly changed. He was both surprised and confused ... The chaos path master had arrived!That was fast!Didn't he just descend?Or did it directly descend to the North?It was not impossible.But ... Since he had come, why did he ... Leave?He was a little confused as he looked forward and frowned. What did the chaos path master mean?Should he inform us or ... Do he have other plans?It was slightly strange!"Dao master has already given the order to cooperate with you, and we will naturally cooperate. However ... You came and then ran away. What are you thinking?The wood spirit envoy's voice rang in his ears,""Big brother, is it the chaos path master?""It should be ... At this time, at this time, who else could it be if not him?""Then why didn't you meet us?""I'm not sure ... Secret?" Jinyang was also having a headache. How would he know what the other party was keeping him in suspense for? he couldn't guess the other party's thoughts at the moment and could only think. The other party had revealed his tracks but disappeared in an instant. Why?He glanced at the other five elements overlords who were also shocked. At this moment, the three of them were also a little confused. Obviously, he had also determined something.Was the chaos path master on guard against them?It can't be, right?Supreme Emperor golden sun was having a headache. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Beside him, the leader of the five-element overlords, Supreme Emperor Sky Gold, suddenly said,""Fellow Daoist jin yang ... You ... You sensed it too, right?"Jin yang nodded slightly.After a moment of silence, Supreme Emperor Sky Gold said,""You and I might not be ... Enemies. At this moment, we might need to cooperate.""Of course, Li Hao and the others forced us to come to the five elements realm. In fact ... We all know what they're thinking. If possible, we don't want to fulfill their wish ..." Supreme Emperor golden sun said thoughtfully."Fellow Daoists, have you received any news?" he asked.As soon as he said that, Supreme Emperor Sky Gold's eyes flickered. It seemed that this time, it was not a decision made by a single rank nine, but ... The entire group!He nodded slightly and smiled. At this moment, his smile was somewhat sincere."In this way, actually ... We won't have any conflicts in the short term. At present, the North may be the weakest in everyone's eyes, but that may not be the case now!"Supreme Emperor golden sun heaved a sigh of relief.Was this really a chess piece left behind by the five elements old ghost?He had hidden it deep enough. Although he had been guessing, there was no way to confirm it. There was nothing he could do. There were too many people who cultivated the five elements. It was impossible to determine who was stronger just because it was arranged by the five elements Dao master.But now, he was somewhat certain."Why ... Did that person ... Just leave?" he asked.Strange!"I don't know,"Supreme Emperor Sky Gold shook his head. 'How would I know?'Logically speaking, if you have any plans, you can just meet and talk about it. Why are you deliberately mystifying it?"Let's wait a little longer!""Perhaps ... This person has his own ideas and plans. We just have to do our best to cooperate with him!"Wu Xing did not say anything more.……At the same time.Li Hao, however, raised his eyebrows. It was strange that they didn't chase him.Why?No matter what, with the appearance of the power of Chaos, it didn't matter if it was determined to be the chaos path master himself. Shouldn't he be more careful?Worried that it was a trap?So, he didn't dare to chase?"Interesting ... Why ... Not care?"Li Hao touched his chin. These guys didn't even care about me. I was thinking that if they chased me, I would take them for a walk and make some noise to let people know.But now ... He was no longer chasing.This didn't make sense!You're not going to care about such a huge threat?Even if you know each other ... Even if there's some agreement between the ninth-rank, can't you at least show some sincerity?The perfect plan seemed to have gone wrong."Senior ... No one's chasing?"At this moment, the flying Tiger was also shocked and scared.That good?Li Hao smiled."I'm fine ... By the way, don't you like to eat chaotic force? The chaotic force around a major world is the purest because it's absorbed by the major world itself. Let's go to the North and eat a little. "

Chapter 3658 The Opportunity Has Come (3)
"Is this ... Appropriate?"The flying Tiger was a little scared."Don't be afraid. I'm here. Who can kill you?"Li Hao smiled."Don't worry. I'll absorb some to replenish myself. I've just arrived, and my strength hasn't recovered to its peak. It's normal to absorb some chaotic force, right?"Descend?Where did it descend from?The flying Tiger was confused again.Li Hao gritted his teeth. He wanted to keep a low profile. If you guys don't chase me, then don't blame me. I'll absorb some power of chaos everywhere and leave behind some chaotic aura ... Although it's a little obvious and a little intentional ...However, I'm a rank nine, isn't it normal for me to be a little arrogant?Of course, there were also a few more flaws.However, the five elements realm doesn't follow the routine. I can only do this.Li Hao said no more. He rode the flying Tiger and headed to the other level 8 worlds. As the Overlord of the North, the five elements realm would definitely care about extracting some chaotic force from each family ... I'll give you a headache!……Soon, there was a commotion in the North.In the next two days, several rank eight worlds began to show signs of activity. Large amounts of Primal Chaos energy were being absorbed, and by the time experts appeared, they had already disappeared.It didn't leave anything behind ... Only some fluctuations, which seemed to be slightly chaotic.All of a sudden, there was a commotion in the North.To be able to absorb such a large amount of Primal Chaos energy from a rank eight world while avoiding their eyes and ears, it was obvious that the person who was absorbing the primal Chaos energy was not a weakling, but a peak expert.To a type 8 powerhouse, this was a provocation!But ... This was also a great deterrent!"If I can silently absorb Primal Chaos energy from your world, then I can also silently approach your world and kill you!……Five elements realm.At that moment, eight rank eight venerable sovereigns had gathered. Venerable Skygold was having a headache. "Isn't he being too high-profile? I know he's powerful, a class 9, but he's only just arrived and hasn't recovered to his peak. I also know that he's just arrived and needs a large amount of chaotic force to replenish himself ... But he can keep a low profile, or use us to provide him with resources ..."Was there a need for this?The entire North was in a state of panic.Yet, they could not say anything.Furthermore, he had to follow them and clean up after them!It completely annihilated the chaotic energy that the other party had left behind!艹!Supreme Emperor Sky Gold could not understand what was going on in the chaos Supreme Emperor's mind.What do you want to do? Jin yang and the others also frowned. At this moment, Huo Yan said,""Do you ... Have your own plans? His main goal was chaos. At this moment, everyone was panicking. Was he deliberately creating chaos to make him stronger? He didn't look for us because he was worried that we'd put some restrictions on him ... So, he hopes that he'll come to find us after he's recovered enough strength. Last time, he might've come to give us a heads up and remind us not to worry about anything ..."His guess made some sense after some thought.However, Supreme Emperor Sky Gold quickly frowned. "I'm not worried about the chaos in the North. I'm worried that ... There might be people planted in the North. If we kept a low profile, we might have more opportunities, but I'm worried that if we were discovered and the news spread to the other factions, they might ally together again! It's true that he's at the ninth step, but Hundun can't support the full power of a ninth step cultivator at the moment ... When that happens, it'll be troublesome. "He was a little unhappy! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Also, why did you come to the North to create chaos?He might as well go to another area!Suddenly, Supreme Emperor golden sun said,""Is he trying to create his own chaotic system? is he trying to establish himself in the North? is that why he's causing trouble in the North first? he's not meeting us because he's worried that we'll try to stop him, and that you'll try to stop him. After all ... The North is your territory."These words made some sense.He could only think this way!"Let's hope so. I'm just afraid that once the news spreads, it won't be good for our next plan. This is really ..."Supreme Emperor Skygold said in a deep voice.He was speechless!He was a little annoyed!……Huntian realm.Huntian Supreme Emperor also frowned.Chaos, how bold."Or is it that he already knows that I know he has arrived, so I act without fear? is a ninth-rank really that great?You're just a weakling among the ninth-rank!Not only that, you're not even at the peak of your strength ... How can you be so reckless? are you afraid that I won't know you've arrived?Huntian narrowed his eyes.The black shadow had already gone there, and there was not much news yet, but ... It was now certain that the chaos had reached the North!Moreover, he had been absorbing a large amount of chaotic force recently, probably in preparation for his recovery.Really ... The weaker the person, the more arrogant he was."Even though tianfang's descent is arrogant, he'll definitely be more low-key next time after suffering a loss. Yet, you're here with your true body. If you die, you'll really die. How dare you be so arrogant!He had wanted to wait a few more days before heading over to investigate the other party's whereabouts, but it seemed like ... There was no need for that anymore!You're being so ostentatious, but you'll probably reveal your true appearance very soon."I'd like to see ... How much you've recovered!"Huntian Supreme Emperor snorted and disappeared.……At the northern border.The chaos path master wasn't in a hurry. He leisurely headed north, stopping as he walked. After so many years, the chaos had changed. Things had remained the same, but people had changed.

Chapter 3659 The Opportunity Has Come (3)
At this moment, he was actually ... Riding a ferocious beast.Of course, it wasn't a Tiger, but an extremely huge bird.A ninth level venerable sovereign still needed to be respected.Sensing that the power of the five elements was getting stronger, he smiled. Soon, he raised his eyebrows and murmured,""Interesting. Did you prepare it for me in advance?"The North seemed to be a little chaotic.He felt slightly flustered!Did you know that I was coming, so you prepared in advance so that I could move in in time?As expected, it was much more convenient to have someone to help.It had only been a few days, and he was already considered fast. The other party had actually made arrangements. When he felt the weak chaotic aura, he smiled. He was very considerate!That's good!To avoid trouble.At this moment, he suddenly frowned. In the distance, a black shadow seemed to flash by.……At this moment, the black figure from the huntian realm was shocked!What a F * cking coincidence!It was chaos!She almost bumped into him, but ... This fellow ... Why was he here?"I've heard that this guy is absorbing chaotic force on the other side. He's so fast! A ninth-ranked beast is a ninth-ranked beast, and he's actually here in an instant!" The black Shadow's expression changed.The Dao master hadn't come yet. He might not be able to deal with the chaos alone. He couldn't fight him head-on.In the back, the chaos path master frowned slightly.He was a very powerful person!There was a vague ... Familiar feeling. Who was it?They had just entered the northern region, and they had already sensed a powerful level eight. They were really ... Unlucky.The other party ran so fast. Does he know me?His heart trembled and his face turned ugly. He still wanted to keep a low profile for a while. The next moment, he urged the big Bird under him and disappeared in the direction where the black shadow had disappeared.……On the other side.Li Hao absorbed some more chaotic force. At this moment, his eyes were changing. Beside him, the flying Tiger was burping happily.Cool!In the past, it had not dared to draw too close to major worlds to absorb Primal Chaos energy, but the past few days had been simply too pleasurable. It had gone from world to world to absorb Primal Chaos energy. Most importantly, it had been very safe, and almost no one had cared.There were a few times when it thought that someone was about to catch up to it, but soon ... The other party stopped chasing.It wished it could do this every day!He was so happy!At this moment, Li Hao was lost in thought. Interesting. The chaos power I left behind was actually destroyed by someone, as if someone was deliberately cleaning up my tracks to prevent my whereabouts from being leaked! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Who did this?In the North, only the world of five elements could do this.Why so? Is it because ... They've determined my identity, and the arrival of the chaos path master is a good thing for them?Or could it be that ... There were other reasons? for example, they were allies with the chaos path master?However, he had caused quite a commotion, and the Northerners were all panicking at the moment ... Huntian should have received the news. Would he come?The reaction from the North was beyond Li Hao's expectations.But ... It didn't seem too bad.On the contrary, it was safer and more comfortable."Flying Tiger, are you interested in ... Eating more?" Li Hao smiled.At this moment, the flying Tiger was extremely happy. It hurriedly said,""I'll go wherever you go, senior ..."I wish I could run around with you every day.'In just a few days, I've eaten more than I've ever eaten in a few hundred years. Furthermore, the power of Chaos is very pure. It's so satisfying.'"Let's go to the five elements realm and eat another wave ... The energy in the five elements realm is more ... And richer!""This ...""I'm fine, don't worry!"Li Hao smiled. He had to test the waters again. If the other party did not make any big moves this time, perhaps ... There was some inside information that he did not know about, which was that the five elements realm might be related to huntian Supreme Emperor.Otherwise, it wouldn't be like this.Let's test him first!It was originally meant to create chaos, but now, something interesting seemed to have happened.……Five elements realm.Suddenly, a powerful suction force came.The few venerable sovereigns who were having a headache suddenly shifted their gazes. Venerable Sky Gold quickly said,""It's here ... This ...""He's absorbing the nearby Primal Chaos energy!""Stop him?""Stop what ... He should still be recovering ..."The few venerable sovereigns spoke quickly, and venerable Sky Gold raised his brows slightly."He still doesn't want to meet us. Is he worried about what we'll do to him? You're really ... Very careful!"He was speechless!But very quickly, he gritted his teeth and said,'I'll output all the energy stored in the Dao universe and let him absorb it! Let him recover his strength, so that he doesn't run around all day long, and also show him our sincerity! Since we're all on the same boat, we'll naturally cooperate with the Dao master's orders!"As soon as he said this, the others thought for a while and nodded.However, on Wu Xing's side, Shui Linglong whispered,"Are you sure it's him? If this isn't ..."That would be a huge joke!"How can that be?" Tian Jin laughed.Did this even need to be asked?Apart from him, who else would dare to come near my five elements realm at a time like this and arrogantly absorb chaotic power?Moreover, there was still some chaos power spreading.If it wasn't the chaos path master, could it have been someone else?Furthermore, he was extremely powerful ... No matter how he thought about it, it couldn't be anyone else. Furthermore, he knew the experts in the entire Primal Chaos. Other than chaos, who needed to quickly recover their battle strength and absorb a large amount of Primal Chaos energy, the others ... Even if they really came, they wouldn't be so arrogant!
