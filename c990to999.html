        looks of it, the consumption was not small.
         "Many thanks, senior!"
         "It's a win-win situation. "
         Little tree didn't need his thanks. He only hoped that this person in front of him could bring him enough returns.
         "Then my brothers will stay here. If I'm fine, I'll come back as soon as possible. If I don't come back ... Senior, you can just let them out!"
         After saying this, Li Hao and Liu Long gave a few instructions and then directly drilled out of the hole.
         ……
         He walked out of the cave.
         Li Hao took a deep breath. The sky was still dark, but it was starting to light up.
         He didn't stay any longer, he rose into the air and hurried on his way.
          Without the demon hunt squad, his speed was even faster.
         Martial masters could fly, but it would consume a lot of energy. Li Hao didn't care, though. Sword energy could be used, but it wouldn't consume too much energy.
         He had to get the deposit first.
         After a long time, the voice came from the armor again,""Where are you?"
         "We are still 50 li away from you!"
         “……”
         Kong Jie was speechless. How did you know?
         He looked at the black armor on his body ... He roughly understood. This thing can actually locate me. In other words, this kid knew when I came out?
         This thing was good, but it couldn't be used recklessly.
         Otherwise, she would have been under Li Hao's surveillance.
         50 li wasn't far.
         The two of them were running at full speed. Not long after, Li Hao saw Kong Jie's dot of light. That was black Phoenix's location. As for Kong Jie herself, she was also very eye-catching, but he had to get close to see her.
         p Li Hao's figure flickered, and the two met a moment later.  Kong Jie looked at Li Hao and sighed.""You ... If you had just agreed to it without any conditions, I might have been able to fight for an extremely good opportunity for you!"
         What a pity!
         If Li Hao had not stated his conditions this time and had directly agreed, he felt that he could have brought up the matter of controlling Silver Moon again. Li Hao had missed a great opportunity.
         Huang Yu and director Zhao would think that he lacked the spirit to contribute, and they would not agree to let Li Hao join them easily.
         Li Hao laughed,"what chance?" Is it more valuable than this?"
         "You ... Don't understand!"
         Kong Jie shook her head. If Li Hao could get to the top, the resources he had would be incomparable. It meant a lot, not just status, but also the sharing of secrets and cooperation. It meant that if Li Hao had any problems, others would help him. This was basic.
         But now, Li Hao had missed this opportunity.
         Li Hao didn't care. Nothing was more important than the benefits he had.
         30,000 divine power stones and three wood-type origin weapons might be enough for him to comprehend it three times. Li Hao felt that he would almost certainly succeed and form the wood sword force. If he could merge the five Forces ... He would be able to reach the late-stage or peak of the rising light realm, even if he couldn't reach the metamorphosis realm.
         Only strength was his own!
         People like Hong Yitang were free and unfettered because they had power.  The Sword of Light was worth Silver moon's sacrifice, because of its power.
         Having no power was the most lamentable thing.
         I don't need it, but I must have it.
         "Secretary, where's the stuff?"
         Kong Jie was a little reluctant, but she still threw the storage ring to Li Hao."" 10000 divine power stones and two wood-type origin weapons. You'll have to complete the task before you pay the rest."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Since you've taken the money, there's one thing you have to do ..." He added."If you Save the Light sword, you can't represent yourself, but the Silvermoon officials. You've given her help. You have to make it clear!"
         Li Hao nodded."Of course! I won't do such a tasteless thing!"
         Li Hao laughed."But I have to say something. She asked me to help her suppress the riot in her body once. If I save her this time, I'll make it clear. I didn't say I was going to help her!"
         "That's up to you!"
         Kong Jie didn't say much, all they had to do was to let the light sword appreciate it.
         "I have to go back. I can't stay outside for too long. The timing is sensitive ..." He said.
         With that, he turned around to leave.
         "Director," Li Hao shouted."Someone is watching you. Don't you know how to fight back?"
         “……”
         "It's not the time yet!"Kong Jie said helplessly.
         “……”
         Okay.
         Li Hao sneered but didn't say anything.
         The time wasn't right?
         These were the same words.
         What was the right time?
         Forget it, it has nothing to do with me. Let these people do as they please.
         Li Hao rose into the air and headed straight for the North Sea. He had taken the money to get rid of the disaster for others.
         At this moment, a Black Dog was also running quickly underground. Li Hao didn't want to bring the Black Panther. In fact, Li Hao didn't want to fight it head-on. If there was a chance, he would save it. If there wasn 't, he would just forget it.
          He had said that if there was no chance, he would not return the deposit.
         However, the Black Panther didn't seem to be very comfortable there. As soon as Li Hao left, it quickly followed him. Li Hao could only let it be. The Black Panther was indeed not weak. With it around, his safety was somewhat guaranteed.
         Li Hao Ran quickly. A man and a dog soon entered the lunar ocean.
         Li Hao waved his hand, and the giant chariot appeared.
         The man and the dog boarded the boat. The moment they got on, Li Hao took out the crystal tree root.
         What kind of one-time killing talisman was this?
         That would be an idiotic action!
         He would take this opportunity to comprehend it once, and perhaps he would be able to condense the wooden sword force. What kind of offensive talisman would he need that was comparable to the late-stage of the rising light?
         In an instant, Li Hao's divine will poured into it.
         At this moment, just like before, a faint pressure enveloped Li Hao. Li Hao seemed to have entered another universe and began to grow with the tree.
        
         At this moment, while Li Hao was comprehending the origin Energy ...
         In the North Sea.
         Deep in the ocean.
         At the bottom of the sea, a resplendent building appeared. Within it, a sleeping great demon suddenly opened its eyes. It seemed to have felt the special fluctuations and revealed a look of suspicion.
         "The power of the origin ..." He mumbled after a long time."Is there still an origin demon alive today? is it still walking in the North Sea?"
         The big demon wanted to investigate and take a look ...
         However, he quickly dispelled this thought.
         He let out a soft sigh. At this moment, he couldn't rashly investigate, nor could he rashly leave. This world was different!
         Those guys in the ruins might have felt the same, but it had long felt that things were different.
         ……
          At this moment, Li Hao knew nothing.
         He was immersed in this feeling.
         He was like a tree, taking root and sprouting. His branches swayed and fluttered in the wind.
         One year, two years, three years ...
         In his memory, countless years seemed to have passed.
         But in reality, it had only been a short while.
         After an unknown amount of time, the origin Energy around Li Hao completely dissipated. Li Hao opened his eyes, and the crystal root in his hand completely shattered and disappeared.
         ? Li Hao's eyes were filled with confusion and regret.
         One more time ... As long as he could do it one more time, he would definitely be able to successfully comprehend it!
         Yes, Li Hao knew that he was just a little bit away.
         That kind of vitality, that kind of restlessness. At this moment, he was so close. He was so close to becoming this tree that he couldn't persist until the other party comprehended the origin and dissipated.
         Li Hao gritted his teeth. What a pity!
         No, perhaps little tree did it on purpose. He only gave Li Hao this much, because there would be no next time after Li Hao realized it.
         "Just a little bit more ..."
         Li Hao took a deep breath and quickly calmed down.
         If he was close, he might not need to continue looking for the small tree.
         Perhaps ... He could find an expert and have a good fight with him.
         Back then, when his teacher had comprehended the five Forces, his conditions were much worse than his, and his strength was also much weaker, but he had still successfully comprehended them. It was all through battle after battle.
         The giant venomous ship was speeding through the sea.
         The Black Panther was lying on the bow of the boat, looking bored. It seemed to be fishing with its tail ... I don't know what this dog is thinking. Can you catch a fish at such a fast speed?
         Seeing Li Hao look at it, the Black Panther's tail stood up with a big fish on it. The Black Panther looked at Li Hao suspiciously."Do you want to eat?"
         “……”
         Li Hao was speechless. I thought you were fishing, but you were actually fishing!
         Seeing that Li Hao wasn't eating, the Black Panther shook its tail and got rid of the big fish. It didn't eat either. It was just that it remembered someone who liked to eat fish and used his tail to fish.
         ……
         Just as Li Hao was rushing toward the North Sea.
         The North Sea was also in chaos.
         One by one, the Pirates received the news that the light sword was about to cross the eastern sea and was heading towards the northern Sea.
         The White shark Pirates.
         At this moment, another person appeared beside white shark. He was also wearing a mask and his voice was a little low."General white shark, the higher-ups want us to kill the light sword and take the Windchaser's boots! But of course, if you can take the radiant sword with you ... It'll be better if you're alive. "
         "The five generals of the dingguo Army were all killed in an instant. Are you sure you can do it?" white shark frowned.
         "That was before. Now, the light sword is barely hanging on ... More importantly, many people are fishing in troubled waters. Don't forget that the North Sea is our world ..."
         White shark did not comment.
         Our world?
          He was thinking too much.  Of the eight Pirates of the North Sea, the White shark Pirates were not the first.
         Moreover, the second and third brothers had just died, and the situation was still chaotic. It was not a good time to go and get Hu Guangming's sword.
         However, this was a person from above.
         Even though white shark was stronger than him and he wasn't too afraid, there was no need for him to fall out with him. After some consideration, he said,""The light sword might escape to the Silver Moon, hoping that the Silver Moon Martial Master will save her. We don't need to make a big fuss ... We just need to wait here, and maybe we'll be able to find her."
         "I'm afraid that she'll die before we get here. "
         "General Bai, why don't you take the initiative to approach the eastern sea ..." The masked man advised.
         "Let me think!"
         White shark was too lazy to care. What a joke. That was someone else's territory. Wouldn't he be asking for trouble if he went there?
         In fact, he hoped that the Sword of Light would escape to the Silver Moon. Her pursuers might also go there and create chaos for the Silver Moon. That would be an opportunity to deal with Li Hao.
         ……
         At the same time.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At the border of the eastern sea and the northern Sea.
         The light sword kept spurting out blood and some pieces of her internal organs. However, even at this moment, she was not dead. There was a burst of light power that spread throughout her body, suppressing her injuries.
         When she asked Li Hao to help her suppress it that day, she wasn't completely without confidence.
         The power of light was very suitable for healing.
         If it were anyone else, they would have exploded long ago. However, she had been on the run all the way and was still alive.
         There was still some hope in her eyes ... But the hope was gradually extinguished.
         The people behind him were in hot pursuit.
         The key was that the news had leaked too quickly, and there were already cultivators who had begun to surround and intercept her. Obviously, the Duke dingguo's mansion had not been able to capture her, but some people were tempted.
         The Sword of Light looked at the North Sea in front of him ... He had to pass through the North Sea and enter the region of the moon sea to enter the Silvermoon region. However, the distance from here to there was more than a thousand li!
         She probably wouldn't be able to hold on until then.
         "I've tried my best ..."
         The light sword muttered to itself, but it didn't have the chance.
         But even so, she would not die like this!
         The light sword continued to escape. She also wanted to see who would be the first to jump out. Even if her five internal organs were completely destroyed, she still wanted to kill a few powerhouses and let the world know that the light sword was unparalleled in power!
         As long as one of the Seven Swords of the Silvermoon was still alive, they were not trash!
         Of course, the Azure light sword was an ancient technique. The ancient technique was incomplete and its progress was slow, so she directly ignored it.
         Time slowly passed.
         The light sword's eyes grew more and more fierce.
         Too many people had come!
         How long has it been?
         She had already sensed that there were probably no less than ten people following behind just Sunglow. They were all very powerful and not the kind of people who had just entered the realm.
         And there might still be people waiting for her ahead.
          ……
         At this moment, Li Hao had completely entered the North Sea.
         Seeing the boundless ocean, Li Hao couldn't help but walk out of the cabin. This was the first time he had left the Silver Moon's territory. This place no longer belonged to the Silver Moon's territory.
         The waves in the North Sea were even bigger!
         The rumbling sound of waves was deafening.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, felt relaxed and happy. The North Sea was really beautiful!
         Unfortunately, it did not belong to Silver Moon.
         The Black Panther was also curious and looked around. The sea was so big and beautiful.
         A man and a dog sat at the bow of the ship. At this moment, there was no fear of danger, only the pleasure of seeing more. Perhaps I should have gone out with hou Xiaochen that day, Li Hao thought.
         [PS: please give me some guaranteed monthly votes!]
        
         The sea and the sky were vast.
         As the divine boat traveled across the sea, Li Hao felt refreshed after seeing the vast world.
         It was different from the Moonsea, where one could see the shores on both sides. It was a sea, but it was still rather narrow.
         However, the North Sea had no end.
         Li Hao stood at the bow of the ship and looked around.
         This was the North Sea.
         The core of the dynasty, the central region, was surrounded by the sea. The four Seas, North, South, East, and West, divided the entire dynasty into two large pieces.
         Li Hao looked to the South, which was the central continent.
         However, the information from the heaven battling Army showed that it might have been an Island, not a core continent.
         Li Hao observed his surroundings and waved the small sword in his hand.
          They fluttered in the wind like willow catkins.
         The sword was light and agile.
         The divine boat shot forward. Li Hao could vaguely see some light orbs. They were far away, but they weren't too far away.
         The small boat moved towards the light ball. A moment later, a merchant ship appeared.
         There seemed to be someone on the deck of the ship.
         Li Hao glanced at them. They were not Pirates, so he didn't bother to look at them again. The boat sailed away. Someone on the deck seemed to have seen something, but they couldn't see it clearly. In the city, there was probably another gossip legend about a big fish appearing in the sea at night, as fast as a shuttle.
         ……
         Very quickly, the small boat was shuttling back and forth.
         Another ship appeared. Its appearance was no different from a merchant ship, but there were many supers inside. At a glance, the two three suns had nearly a hundred supers.
         In the sea, 99% of such teams were Pirates.
         There was also a slight surprise. It was possible that the Land Army's elimination of Pirates ... Was extremely rare!
         Li Hao stepped on the deck and rose into the air.
         In an instant, he shuttled through the void and stood on the big ship. His ears trembled slightly as he listened to the words on the ship. A moment later, he confirmed the identity of the other party. They were indeed a group of Pirates.
         In the next moment, the sword light flashed!
         BOOM!
         With a deafening sound, the cabin exploded. A group of supers shouted, the three suns roared, and the sword light illuminated the void.
         "Who are you? What grudge do you have?"
         One of the three suns shouted,"we are the people of the shattering sea Army ..."
         The so-called Navy was just a cover, the broken Pirates of the eight great Pirates.
         Li Hao's sword rippled, and his head flew up.
         "Li Hao from the five birds sect!"
         Li Hao chuckled and slashed down with his sword. The Pirates in all directions exploded!
         Three suns, who had just shouted, had his head on the ground.
         In the blink of an eye, all the supers on the ship were killed.
         With a wave of his hand, a few storage rings fell into his hands.  He didn't bother to search and just did a simple check. There was no one alive in the ship. He pierced the ship with his sword, and the ship was instantly flooded. It was about to sink.
         Li Hao didn't care anymore. He rose into the air and returned to the divine boat.
         It didn't take long.
         When he saw injustice, he drew his sword to resolve a thousand worries.
         He didn't like Pirates.
         As a Martial Master, if he liked someone, he would like them. If he didn 't, he would use his own methods to make them disappear. Li Hao seemed to be more open now that he had left Silver Moon.
         "Let's go!"
         Li Hao shouted when he saw that the dog was still playing with the Pirates in the water.
         A smile appeared on Gou 'Zi's face. He killed the last pirate who jumped into the sea with one paw and swam back to the ship. The small ship continued to shuttle back and forth, but the big ship behind it gradually sank.
         A hundred-man team of the eight Pirates, led by the three suns, disappeared into the vast sea.
         Li Hao sped along.
         Along the way, whenever he saw a pirate ship, he would stop and kill it. As for looking for the light sword ... This was also a way to find it. Perhaps after killing too many people, the light sword would come out on its own.
         The sky was already bright.
         In the sea, the sunrise was exceptionally beautiful at dawn. It was as if a red sun had emerged from the sea and reflected red on the entire sea.
         Li Hao looked into the distance and frowned.
         It had been about three hours since he entered the sea.
         The giant venomous ship was very fast. It had traveled at least a thousand miles, but Li Hao still could not see the light sword. Li Hao was worried that he would miss the other party. The sea was too vast. If the other party were to walk on the other side, Li Hao might not be able to see them.
         He could see the ball of light. In this place without any cover, if it was the rising light, he could even see the ball of light from 10000 meters away. However, 10000 meters was only 20 miles. In the sea, 20 miles was too short.
         "It's not easy to find!"
         Li Hao sighed and looked at the young paparazzo,"Black Panther, can you smell it?"
         p The Black Panther's nose twitched, and it shook its head. This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Its sense of smell was limited.
         It was not an easy task to find someone in the vast ocean.
         "Maybe ... I can catch a strong person and ask."
          The eight great pirate groups in the North Sea were well-connected, so they should know where the light sword was.
         However, none of the eight great pirate clans were easy to deal with.
         "Or, a large merchant group, a merchant group ..."
         In the sea, there were also a large number of sea merchant teams.
         They transported the resources from the central region to all directions, and also transported the rare materials from all directions to the central region. Their business was very big, and they all had the support of major forces.
         These people were also well-informed.
         Furthermore, those who traveled on the sea would usually have a good relationship with Pirates. Some caravans might be caravans one moment and become Pirates the next. This was what the information left behind by golden spear and the others said.
         Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't have known these details.
         It was difficult to find someone in the vast sea.
         However, with this idea in mind, Li Hao sped up. In the blink of an eye, he traveled another hundred miles. Three ships appeared in front of him, but he didn't know if they were caravans or pirates.
        
         When he got closer, he sensed that it should be a caravan.
         Pirates had a very obvious characteristic. There were no ordinary people on board. Pirates might have trained some new Pirates, but they would not be on the ship. They had bases, on islands, or simply on the shore.
         As for the merchant ships, they also had super Dao protectors, but there would not be many of them.
         In front of them, a flag was hanging on the merchant ship.
         Li Hao was the Deputy Minister of the night patrolman, after all. Those who were famous knew a little about these flags. At a glance, he recognized that it was the gold flag of the Financial Secretary, one of the nine divisions.
         The Financial Secretary's caravan?
         Li Hao thought about the young man from the Liu family who had been killed last time. He seemed to be from the financial division, but it had little to do with Li Hao. He had been killed by Qi gang and Hu Qingfeng.
         The nine divisions each had their own flag.
         Of course, the entire dynasty also had its own Sky Star flag, but it had not been waved in the air for many years.
         There were actually three suns on this ship.
          It seemed that the Financial Secretary was not weak.
         As Li Hao thought about this, he rose into the air and flew toward the big ship in the distance. On the ship, a young man in his thirties looked around, and his expression suddenly changed. At this moment, the sky was already bright, and the young man immediately saw the expert who was flying over from the distance.
         No aura was revealed!
         They were either top-notch martial masters or rising light realm experts.
         "Who's there? We are the four Seas group under the jurisdiction of the financial division, directly under the nine divisions ..."
         BOOM!
         While the young man was speaking, Li Hao had already landed.
         The young man's expression changed. In an instant, more than a dozen supers gathered. They were extremely alert and worried. Who had the guts to attack the four Seas business group?
         At this moment, Li Hao presented a token in his hand.""Night patrolman, advanced city patroller ..."
         "How audacious!"
         Upon hearing that the other party was a night patrol, a superpower shouted angrily,""How dare a Nightwalker trespass on the four Seas group's merchant ship? which division are you from?"
         Li Hao was stunned for a moment. Then, he smiled."When you see Pirates, you'll be submissive. When you see night patrollers, you'll be heavily punched!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he kicked!
         BOOM!
         With a loud sound, the man was kicked away and landed on the deck. Li Hao looked at the young man. The young man was about to say something when a sword light flashed. The young man was covered in cold sweat, and his hair fell off one by one.
         "It's said that the nine divisions and the three major organizations are the same. I didn't believe it at first, but now ... They're not much different."
         The reason why he said that was because the young man seemed to be preparing to attack.
         He had exposed his identity as the night patrolman, but the other party seemed to be about to make a move. He had not revealed his identity just now, but this guy looked nervous.
         Is this a merchant group under the jurisdiction of the nine divisions?
         It felt even worse than being a pirate!
         "Patrol envoy ... I ..." The young man swallowed.  "I'm too lazy to talk nonsense. Have you received the news? The light sword has been surrounded and it seems like she has entered the North Sea Region. Do you know her exact location?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The young man was startled.
         This ... What was he doing?
         If he asked the light sword, it meant that the other party must be very strong. Was he a top-tier Martial Master?
         And a top-notch Sunglow expert?
         However, was such a person only a City Patrol envoy?
         He didn't dare to say anything more and hurriedly said,""Two hours ago, we received a message telling us to avoid ..."
         "What channels do you use to communicate?"
         The young man was taken aback once more. He hesitated for a moment, but still took out a jade pendant."This is a communication jade pendant. It was excavated from the ancient civilization and put into use a few years ago. All the large organizations and institutions ... Have it."
         He was a little confused and glanced at Li Hao.
         This ... This can't be a fake night patrol, right?!
         With such strength, there was no reason for him not to know this.
         "This Jade can send messages within a 1500-kilometer radius. Every organization is able to react quickly because there's a messenger center in a certain area ... It can send messages to specific people or send messages on a large scale. However, it takes time, and sometimes, the messenger center can't receive the message in time ..."
         Li Hao received the jade pendant, somewhat surprised.
         Was it?
         There was such a method?
         This, he really did not know.
         It was no wonder that some news could be transmitted so quickly. For example, Silver Moon had received the news of the battle in the Eastern Region in less than five hours. No matter how fast a person's men were, it would not be so fast.
         The ancient civilization ... Was indeed powerful.
         Of course, one could tell just by looking at the armor.
          Li Hao took the jade pendant and examined it. There seemed to be some small characters on it. Seeing that Li Hao was interested, the young man said nervously,""This type of communication Jade can only store 10 messages. There isn't enough space inside, and it will appear when a message is sent. If you want to send a message back, there's a red button on the jade pendant. Press it, enter the message, and you'll be sent to the nearest transit station. "
         It wasn't very convenient, but it was much better than the communication devices of today.
         Li Hao checked it. There was indeed some information saved on it.
         The most recent one was from two hours ago.
         "The light sword has entered the North Sea. The experts from all directions are pursuing it. The battle will start at any moment. Everyone in the North Sea, pay attention to avoid it. The light sword is powerful and there are many pursuers ..."
         Two hours ago, the other party had already entered the North Sea!
         Li Hao quickly recalled the map of the North Sea. The North Sea spanned a long distance.
         Entering from the East, in two hours, the radiant swords could fly at most a thousand miles.
         As for himself, he had probably crossed about a thousand miles in the North Sea.
         The distance between the two sides was still a little far. The North Sea was not from the Silver Moon to the East Sea. If one crossed the Silver Moon, they would still be in the North Sea, but they would no longer be connected to the Silver Moon.
        
         Even so, there was still a distance of at least three thousand miles between the two of them.
         Even if Li Hao and the other party advanced at full speed, it would take them two or three hours to meet.
         And this was if he had been going all out, traveling four to five hundred miles in an hour.
         "No wonder I couldn't find it ..."
         Li Hao was helpless. There were still two to three hours.
         In addition to the time that had been wasted, the light sword had been on the run for almost 10 hours, and he had not died.
         Moreover, under such circumstances, the other party might not be able to rush with all his might.
         It would probably take him a few hours to get there.
         While Li Hao was checking his messages, the young man was sweating profusely and secretly observing Li Hao.
         The night patrolman ...
          There were quite a number of night patrollers in the vicinity.
         Linjiang, Beihai, or Haiyue were all possible.
         Which province's night patrol expert was this person from?
         Or was he just pretending?
         Li Hao checked the communication jade pendant and said to him,""Can I borrow this?"
         "Of course!"
         The young man nodded hurriedly."My Lord needs it. You can take it anytime."
         "Does this have a location?"
         The young man was stunned. He hesitated for a moment before nodding."Yes, but we can't access it. Only ... Only some transit stations can access it."
         "If I'm asking for information, do I need a password, a password, or something like that?"
         The young man grumbled inwardly. He was a little conflicted and didn't dare to say anything.
         It didn't matter if the communication jade pendant was taken away, but there were indeed some secret words in the communication. This was also to prevent others from stealing it and prying into the secrets of the nine divisions.
         Losing the messenger jade pendant was not a big deal, but leaking the secret message was a big crime!
         Li Hao seemed to have understood. He smiled. "What's wrong? can't the night patrolmen get any information support?"
         "No, it's just that, Sir, the system of the Nightwatchers is different from ours ... I ..."
         "Alright!"
         Li Hao didn't force them. He looked at the superpowers around him and smiled."You didn't become a pirate, did you?"
         "Ah?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "You guys don't usually do what Pirates do, right?" Li Hao asked calmly.
         The young man felt a chill in his heart. As if he had sensed something, he hurriedly shook his head. "That's impossible. After all, it's a group under the jurisdiction of the ninth Division. It's different from others. If it's discovered ... Ahem, I can't let the ninth Division be humiliated."
         "Actually, it doesn't matter."
         Li Hao suddenly laughed and said,"merchants on the sea, be it a business group or a pirate ... They are all the same!" However, the organizations under the nine divisions shouldn't go as far as to Rob the ordinary people on both sides of the river, right?"
         "That's impossible!"
         "We've never done such a thing!"The young man quickly said.
         Li Hao said no more and turned to leave.  The young man couldn't help but ask carefully,""May I ask ... Your Excellency's name ..."
         The moment he said that, he regretted asking.
         Those who didn't know would think that he was taking revenge.
         He didn't have the mood.
         He had only lost a jade pendant, so he could just find an excuse. Besides, if he really couldn't match the other party, the higher-ups wouldn't blame him. But now that they were asking ... Wouldn't that be terrible?
         Li Hao thought for a moment and smiled.""Silver Moon Li Hao!"
         The young man was stunned. Li Hao had already left.
         Silver Moon Li Hao!
         The young man was stunned for a moment. After they had left, his expression suddenly changed."Silver Moon Li Hao ... A member of the five birds sect, a disciple of Yuan Shuo, an inheritor of the eight great families ..."
         This ... Why did this person come out?
         Wasn't he still in Silver Moon?
         That wasn't the main point. There was a piece of news about Li Hao in his Jade Messenger pendant, and his expression changed drastically.
         p He prayed that Li Hao didn't notice.  In fact, Li Hao had seen it long ago, but he didn't care too much.
         "After the SI Hai Group enters Silver Moon province and the deal is completed, they will stay in Silver Moon for a period of time and gather all the information they can on Silver Moon Li Hao ..."
         Li Hao didn't find it strange at all that Jiu Si was paying attention to him.
         In fact, Li Hao would not be surprised if Jiu si had his own plans, such as snatching the Li family's sword.
         Li Hao wouldn't even be surprised if Jiusi wanted to kill him.
         Thus, the youth was worried that Li Hao would find out and cause him trouble.
         The young man looked in the direction Li Hao had left, and his expression changed. Someone beside him couldn't help but say,""My Lord, this Li Hao is too arrogant. It seems that he is going to find the light sword. There are many people who want to kill him ..."
         The young man glanced at him and frowned. After a while, he said,""If the experts from the three great organizations and the eight great Pirates had just arrived, would you dare to speak now?"
         "Ah?"
         The subordinate was stunned. What did he mean?
         Of course he wouldn 't!
          Those people were so cruel.
         Seeing this, the young man sighed in his heart and didn't say anything else. Li Hao's previous words were right. Everyone was afraid of the three major organizations and the eight great Pirates, but they weren't ... Afraid of the experts from the government.
         Because they were the subordinates of the nine divisions!
         This was a very common thing because they couldn't do anything to those organizations. However, they had many ways to deal with the experts from the government who had names.
         However, don't forget this person's other identity.
         The young man was about to go back when he suddenly turned his head and said,""He's a Silver Moon Martial Master!"
         The person who had just spoken was stunned. The expressions of some people around him also changed slightly.
         I almost forgot about this!
         This was the Silver Moon barbarian!
         They were not the Nightwatchers from the central continent, but the Silver Moon barbarians. There were also some Silver Moon martial masters in the central continent, such as skysword, who killed without blinking.
        
         There was also Yuan Shuo, who had been extremely famous recently.
         They were all extremely ruthless Silver Moon martial masters.
         And now, the Sword of Light that had killed five great sunrises with a single strike was also a Silver Moon Martial Master.
         It was obvious that the identity of a Silver Moon Martial Master was much more intimidating than the night patrolman. For a moment, no one said anything. Night patrolmen were easy to bully, but Silver Moon martial masters were not.
         ……
         The small boat continued to shuttle back and forth.
         Li Hao recalled what had happened just now, laughed, and shook his head.
         The thoughts in his mind were quickly extinguished.
         Jiushi, Oh Jiushi ...
         To be honest, all parties were living quite well. The use of some technology had also made things much more convenient for the people, and their lives were still able to go on. All of this had a lot to do with Jiusi.
          Before the nine divisions were replaced, the imperial family had ruled the world for 120 years. It had changed a little. They imposed heavy taxes and treated human lives like grass. The imperial family had also done evil things. That was the bitter time.
         ,m Therefore, even though they were far away from the nine divisions and did not know much about them, they still had some trust and gratitude for them.  But now, the more he knew, the more he knew that Jiusi had become an evil Dragon.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Not doing anything was the biggest mistake.
         He allowed the superpowers to run wild, allowed the three major organizations to rise, and allowed the internal conflicts to spread ...
         All these thoughts rose up and were quickly extinguished.
         It has nothing to do with me for the time being.
         The most important thing right now was to improve his strength, save people, take their money, and get rid of disasters for them. Li Hao understood this.
         Knowing the approximate location of the light sword, Li Hao increased his speed again. The giant chariot seemed to have already taken off, riding the wind and Breaking the Waves, its speed getting faster and faster. This was also something that Li Hao was extremely satisfied with. This origin god weapon was really good.
         ……
         About a thousand miles away from Li Hao.
         The radiant sword roared and slashed out. With a loud bang, an expert who was blocking her way exploded. She also spat out a mouthful of blood and quickly fled with a fierce look in her eyes!
         In the next moment, her ears twitched slightly, and she quickly fled into the sea, disappearing in the blink of an eye.
         A moment later, experts appeared from all directions. Someone glanced at the scene and said in a calm voice,""An arrow at the end of its flight! However, it's best not to get close to her at this moment, in case she retaliates before she dies!"
         "From the way she's heading, she might be heading to Silvermoon to ask for help ... But Silvermoon, if hou Xiaochen leaves, who's going to save her?"
         "The information is here. Silver moon's leaders are still here, especially Huang Yu. He hasn't left white moon City yet ... There's nothing to worry about."
         “……”
         The experts were communicating with each other.
         Behind them, a middle-aged man cupped his hands and said,""The wind chasing boots are the Xu family's heirloom. It doesn't matter if you kill the light sword, seize the treasure, or something else. My father said that whoever gets the wind chasing boots, the Xu family is willing to give 10000 divine energy stones and an origin divine weapon in exchange for the wind chasing boots. As for the other treasures on the light sword, we won't take them!"  "There is only one pair of wind chasing boots, and now the light sword has only taken one. Everyone has obtained it, but there is no way to use it, it is just a decoration ... The help that the Duke dingguo's mansion has given everyone, I will also remember it in my heart!"
         "You're too polite, Duke!"
         Some people laughed and replied, while others ignored him.
         The price the Xu family had offered was not low.
         It was very high!
         However ... To the freelance martial artists and those who did not have the ability to compete with the Xu family, it was of course a good thing. Ten thousand divine power stones was something that no one would not be moved by. If they were lucky, they might even pick it up.
         However, for some large organizations, the most important goal was to get the wind chasing boots.
         They didn't need anything given by the Xu family.
         To be able to reach the Sunglow level and still dare to chase after the radiant sword, who wasn't an expert?
         Who wasn't a top-notch figure from all over the world?
         At the back of the crowd, the young master of the Xu family was the eldest son of Duke dingguo, Xu Zhen, and Xu Feng's father.
         At this moment, the middle-aged man was frowning.
         There were only a few who responded!
         How detestable!
         He cursed in his heart and felt helpless. Who knew that the Sword of Light would be able to hold on for so long after breaking the superpower lock? it was unbelievable. Although it was an arrow at the end of its flight and the opponent did not even dare to use their powerful combat strength.
         However, after such a long chase, it had also attracted many experts.
         If this continued, it would be a problem if he could get back his wind chasing boots.
         His father had asked him to bring some men to chase after him ... If he did not do a good job, his younger brother would probably not give him any time to catch his breath.
          Xu Zhen cursed in his heart as he continued to lead his men in pursuit.
         Of the eight generals, five had been killed.
         The other three had important matters to attend to, so they did not follow him. However, it was not as if the high Duke's public house did not have any powerhouses left. At this moment, the ones following him were the high Duke's public house's foreign officials, all of whom were powerhouses from the East.
         The Duke dingguo's mansion was not the only Overlord in the eastern provinces, but with its strength, it had still recruited many Eastern powerhouses. The Eastern Province was not the northern province. The entire North was a bit bitter and cold.
         Superpowers were also lacking.
         The Silver Moon was the most prosperous, and there was almost no mysterious energy leaking out. The mysterious energy in the East was not weak, but it was only slightly worse than the central continent.
         At this moment, a white-haired old man was beside Xu Zhen. He was tracking Xu Zhen while sending a message,"Vice Commander-in-Chief, quite a few people have come. It's been quite a while. The nine divisions, the three major organizations, the seven divine mountains, and even some people from the Wang family have all come."
         The people of the Wang Residence!
         Xu Zhen furrowed his brows. The royal family was also going to get involved?
         In fact, he had recognized some people, including some powerful cultivators from the surrounding provinces. However, these people might not dare to offend the high Duke's public house. However, the forces listed by the white-haired elder would not care about the high Duke's public house.
        
         "Didn't the red moon retreat? The red moon sent people here too?"
         "This subordinate seems to have sensed Black widow's aura ... It is said that she was originally going to Silver Moon, but she might be staying in the North Sea. Thus, she received the news immediately and came here ..."
         Xu Zhen understood. Black Widow, orange moon.
         "I heard that her daughter has been arrested, and she's being told to turn herself in ... She actually dared to go to Silver Moon?"
         "I'm not sure about that. The Crimson Moon has sent word that she can use treasures to exchange for Ziyue. If Silvermoon doesn't agree, the Crimson Moon will take revenge on Silvermoon ... I think that Silvermoon doesn't want to completely fall out with her. If both sides are at war, they will still exchange. "
         Red Moon hadn't been doing much recently, but they were still building up momentum.
         When Purple Moon was captured, orange moon went to rescue her, and red Moon gave him the information to exchange for Silver Moon with treasures. If silver Moon did not agree, then they would fight to the death ...
         As such, orange moon did not enter Silver moon's range. She was also waiting for a reply.
         However, after hou Xiaochen's departure, Silver Moon had yet to deal with this matter and hadn't given him a reply. Zi Yue was still locked up in the inspection Office.
         The few of them were talking at a fast pace.
          Each and every one of them was very fast, and even Xu Zhen wasn't an idiot.
         The Duke of dingguo only had two di sons, but there were still a few Shu sons, but none of them were qualified to take the position of Duke. Xu Zhen and his younger brother were the only heirs to the position of Duke, and the two brothers had been fighting for many years.
         In terms of martial arts and superpowers, he did not dare to neglect them.
         Xu Zhen wasn't a Martial Master, but a super. He'd long since entered the late stage of the rising light realm, and was heading towards the peak. Although he wasn't as strong as some of the people present, he wasn't weak either.
         His son, Xu Feng, was a well-known figure of the third generation. He was at the middle stage of the rising light realm and was also very young.
         Unfortunately, he died in Silver Moon.
         The more he thought about it, the angrier Xu Zhen became. Originally, this son of his had given him a lot of bonus points, and the old man's attitude towards him had always been very good. But since Xu Feng's death, the old man's attitude towards the second son had improved.
         It couldn't be helped. His second son's daughter was also a genius. Although she wasn't as good as Xu Feng, she had already stepped into the rising light realm. Fortunately, she was a woman. If she was a man, Xu Zhen would be even more restless.
         "Only by killing the light sword, taking back the wind chasing boots, and washing away the public house's shame can we regain our face."
         As he thought about it, Xu Zhen shouted,"quick, continue tracking her. Keep an eye on her. Don't give her the chance to recover or catch her breath. Her light power can heal injuries, but there's a limit. It can't last forever!"
         At this moment, everyone knew why the light sword had been able to last until now.
         Her power was very special.
         Not only could it kill, but it could also heal injuries. She had been suppressing her injuries all this time. An ordinary person would have died long ago, but the light sword was still alive and had an extremely tenacious vitality.
         ……
         In front of him, the light sword sank to the bottom of the ocean. Very quickly, its unfocused eyes returned to normal, and it continued to move forward.
         Someone had been following her, and she couldn't get rid of them.
         At this moment, she couldn't use her full strength. If she used it again, she would explode. At this moment, she could only use the power of the peak of the rising light realm. Otherwise, these people wouldn't dare to chase her so close.
          The energy in his body was almost depleted.  If she was not a Martial Master, she would have used up all her energy. As a Martial Master, her body could still provide her with some inner strength.
         She took out a pill and ate it.
         His somewhat dispirited spirit once again perked up.
         She didn't know how much longer she could hold on. Maybe an hour, maybe ten minutes ... But she still couldn't give up.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, he was feeling a little regretful.
         Before she made her move, she might be able to contact Silver Moon. Even if she could not get any reinforcements, she could at least get silver Moon to send Li Hao over. If she approached the East, she would be able to quickly get Li Hao's help.
         Of course, Li Hao would probably not agree, but the light sword felt that there was still a way.
         However, it was too late to think about this now.
         The key was that the high Duke was stronger than she had expected. Even without unsealing him, he was able to withstand her attack and remain unscathed. This was the most terrifying thing that had forced her to break all the Super locks.
         ……
         In the North Sea.
         As Li Hao continued to move forward, there were more merchant ships and more Pirates on the road.
         What was even more surprising was that some Pirates and merchant ships did not fight to the death as one would imagine!
         Li Hao even saw some Pirates board merchant ships.
         After that, under the escort of some managers, he returned to the pirate ship happily.
         Indistinctly, a voice could be heard,""You can take down the White shark Flag. White shark, that trash, has suffered a great loss at Silver Moon. In the future, there will probably be no place for white shark in the North Sea. You'll also have one less share of the expenses. You can waive the share given to white shark in the future. Of course, the other clans will have to increase it a little, but it should not exceed the amount given to white shark ..."
          "Thank you, commander!"
         A manager quickly flattered.
         These words drifted with the wind and fell into Li Hao's ears.
         Collect fees ... Collect taxes ... Sir ...
         No, they were Pirates.
         He was sure they were Pirates.
         But now, these Pirates were openly collecting taxes here.
         It was no longer a robbery!
         Robbery was like drying the pond to catch fish.
         Even if the taxes were heavy, sea trade was still an extremely profitable business. Some merchant teams were willing to do so. Even if the Pirates charged a high fee, they would still make a lot of profits.
        
         Li Hao didn't attack again, for he didn't have enough time.
         He remembered some people and some flags.
         The eight Pirates of the North Sea all had their own flags.
         The White shark Pirates were originally ranked fourth, and their flag was a large shark.
         In the North Sea, the most famous and strongest pirate group was the Starlight pirate group. They claimed that wherever they went, it was their territory. It was said that the entire pirate group had more than ten thousand superpowers ... It was hard to tell the truth.
         However, there were really many experts.
         The White shark Pirates only had three great commanders. As for the Starlight Pirates, it was said that they weren't any commanders. Their leader was the King of the North Sea, and there were nine other experts under him who were known as the nine Dukes of Starlight.
         Their flags had 10 stars, which meant that the Starlight Pirates were under the control of the King of the North Sea and the nine Archdukes.
         This information flashed through Li Hao's mind.
         He didn't know if he would run into these people this time because they were in the North Sea and they were the number one force in the North Sea. They couldn't just leave them be. They might also be involved.
          While he was thinking, Li Hao took out the jade pendant.
         On it, a line of words appeared.
         "Si Hai group's merchant ship No. 307, you have deviated. You can not move forward. A battle broke out eight hundred miles ahead ten minutes ago. The Sword of Light cut off one of Xuguang's men. Change your course!"
         Li Hao was startled. Was she talking about him?
         Soon, he realized that it might really be the case. The ship he had boarded earlier seemed to be number 307.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In other words, the transit station had located the location of the jade pendant and discovered that the ship had deviated. Although they were still 800 miles away from the other party, they would probably meet very soon based on Li Hao's speed and the speed of the light sword.
         "It's a little chicken ribs ... Or is he deliberately confusing me?"he thought.
         Li Hao thought to himself. He was extremely fast, much faster than the ship.
         The transition station's positioning didn't detect any abnormalities?
         Of course, it was also possible that such a location was only sent after a certain period of time, so the other party might not know where Li Hao had been.
         Li Hao didn't care anymore.
         800 li?
         10 minutes ago ... In that case, they were about to meet.
         Li Hao increased his speed again. The light sword was still alive and had even killed Xu Guang. How tenacious ... At this moment, Li Hao no longer thought about grudges. First, he had taken the money. Second, the other party had broken the SuperLock and was still alive. Such tenacious spirit was somewhat similar to that of the Silver Moon Martial Master.
         Of course, she was.
         They galloped at full speed, one hundred miles, two hundred miles ...
         Li Hao didn't stop. He traveled nearly 400 kilometers at high speed. Li Hao had used up a lot of energy. At this moment, he saw some balls of light. They weren't light swords, but three suns and Sunglow ... It seemed that a blockade had been set up in front of him.
         In the distance, there were experts soaring into the sky.
         Some of them even had golden light in their eyes as they scanned the surroundings.
         An expert seemed to have noticed Li Hao and said,""Starlight Army, seal this place! Unrelated people are not allowed to enter!"
         "My friends from all over the world, the radiant sword has killed a brother of my Starlight Army. I will definitely take revenge for this. Whoever dares to stop me will be the enemy of my Starlight Army!"
         “……”
         The voice of an expert continued to spread.
         In the surroundings, there were also some experts standing. Some of them cursed in their hearts, while others 'eyes flickered as they waited for the opportunity.
         It was obvious that the light sword had been sealed.
         It was in the sea region ahead.
         The Starlight Pirates had also moved out.
         Not far from Li Hao, a few people were standing on the sea. Some snorted, and some clicked their tongues."Did the Duke dingguo invite the Starlight Pirates? That's a big deal. There are at least ten three suns here, right? There are also two sunguangs keeping watch ... And this is only one of the directions ... Could it be that there are also people in other directions?"
         He was speechless!
         The great Pirate of the North Sea had become a true tyrant!
         "It might not be the Duke dingguo, maybe it's other forces ..."
         Someone laughed and then sent a voice transmission, but Li Hao didn't hear it.
         Li Hao frowned. This Pirate team had really become a consensus. No one dared to provoke them.
         These Pirates ran rampant on the sea. It should be known that the North Sea was a strategic passage connecting the 19 provinces in the North and the central region. Once the North Sea was sealed off, the communication between the two sides would be cut off, and no one could eliminate these Pirates.
         Li Hao looked at the two Sunglow. They were both at the early stage of the Sunglow realm.
         He glanced at Black Panther, and black Panther also looked up at Li Hao.
         Li Hao suddenly laughed."You're alone, and I'm alone ... Even pirates can show off their might. Strange things really happen these days!"  The others might be afraid, but he was not.
         Those who are barefoot are not afraid of those who wear shoes.
         What was there to be afraid of?
         Would these people dare to cause trouble at Silver Moon?
         As the four sides discussed, the pirate powerhouses in the air also had proud expressions!
         The North Sea was their territory.
         No matter how strong he was on land, he had to endure it in the sea!
         The light sword would die without a doubt.
         As for the Starlight Pirate team, they were the winners this time. Someone offered a high price of 30000 divine power stones, three drops of water from the spring of life, and 10 origin divine weapons ... To buy the corpse of the light sword and the wind chasing boots.
         As for who had bought it, these people didn't know. However, they knew that it definitely wasn't a single person. It must be a great power that couldn't make an appearance. It could even be the other two founding Dukes. The three great Duke's public houses had never been on good terms.
         These people did not mind paying a huge price for the Windchaser's boots. The two Dukes who were in charge of the South and the West might have been too far away and could not make it in time, so they paid a huge price to buy the light sword's corpse and the Windchaser's boots.
         The two sunrise experts were still thinking.
         It was still threatening everyone.
         At this moment, a series of exclamations sounded by his ear. The next moment, one of them raised his head and seemed to have seen something unbelievable.
         It was ... A sword!
         "How bold ..."
         The man shouted, his heart filled with horror. Who was it?
         Roar!
         Like the roar of a fierce tiger or the eruption of a volcano, the roar rang in his ears. A sharp howl pierced through his eardrums. The long sword shone brightly and pierced through the sky. BOOM!
         The sword fell!
         The sword slashed down, and the sword light flashed.
         Bang! Bang!
         The early-stage rising light expert roared and was torn apart by the sword light like a piece of rag. The long sword fell and split into two!
         Li Hao casually scooped up the corpse, and it fell into the boat below.
         Not far away, the other sunguang was shocked. In the next second, he couldn't care about this anymore. A dog silently attacked him in an instant. Just as the sunguang was about to escape, the dog clawed out with its paw, causing nine overlapping waves to rise on the sea surface!
         BOOM!
         A huge wave swept over. Amidst the monstrous waves, the Black Panther slashed out with its claws and tore the opponent apart!
         The surroundings instantly fell silent.
         The three sun Pirates instantly fled.
         However, the sword light flashed, and in the blink of an eye, the Pirates 'heads fell to the ground.
         In all directions, the experts who had been standing for a long time quickly fled. Some of them were shocked.
         "Who is that?"
         "The tiger's roar ... Is somewhat similar to the five birds technique ..."
         "Sword light ..."
         "It's Li Hao! The demonic sword Li Hao! He's actually here, and he's so bold that he killed an expert of the Starlight Pirates ..."
         "That dog ..." He said.
          “……”
         One by one, the experts fled quickly, their eyes still filled with shock.
         The two sunguangs were killed in an instant!
         Li Hao was too terrifying.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had no intention of hiding his whereabouts. Since he was already here, did he think that everyone else was blind?
         In the blink of an eye, they had killed all the Pirates.
         Li Hao laughed heartily. He was in an exceptionally good mood.
         The next moment, he stepped on the air and flew forward. The light sword should be nearby.
         Li Hao naturally had some capital to be so flamboyant.
         At this moment, Li Hao was extremely flamboyant. He killed his enemies with his sword without any mercy. This time, he killed anyone who tried to stop him!
        
         He killed all the Pirates.
         Li Hao stepped into the air and left.
         In the distance, he could already see some light balls.
         ……
         At this moment, the light sword's face was cold and fierce. After running for a day, she was still stopped. More and more powerful cultivators gathered here. This time, she was probably going to be completely defeated.
         Do you regret it?
         There was nothing to regret.
         The only regret he felt was that he was not strong enough, that he had not killed enough people, that he did not have enough power to intimidate others, and ... That Silver Moon was simply too far away!
         He held a long sword in his hand, and the long sword was hidden in its sheath.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The power of light spread out, and his body was already dyed red with blood. Some of it belonged to him, and some belonged to his enemy.
          "Light sword, hand over the Windchaser's boots!"
         "We have no intention of killing you," someone shouted coldly."Hand over the wind chasing boots, and you can settle The Grudge between you and the Xu family!"
         Yes, they were only here for the treasure.
         As for the killing of the radiant sword, that was the Xu family's business.
         The Sword of Light was clearly in its final struggle. In this situation, these Silver Moon martial masters were still very difficult to deal with, and it was very easy for them to kill some of the powerhouses.
         It wasn't easy to cultivate to the rising light Stage.
         No one wanted to be dragged into this mess by this old witch.
         When the Sword of Light advanced, they would retreat.
         However, they didn't leave and continued to pester him like hyenas. As long as the Sword of Light revealed a flaw, they would take the opportunity to attack.
         No one was willing to force their way in!
         More and more experts gathered from all directions.
         Some of them were wearing masks, some were wearing capes, and some were wearing armor like Li Hao, so their faces could not be seen.
         Many people were hiding their identities.
         They were wary of the Xu family, of the others, and of course, of Silvermoon.
         The Silver Moon Martial Master was quite United outside.
         When it came to the outside world, most of the time, they would work together to fight among themselves. If they killed a light swordsman, they might attract the revenge of other Silver Moon martial masters. If it was in the past, they wouldn't have to worry about it.
         But now, more and more Silver Moon martial masters had come out and revealed their strength.
         ……
         In the distance.
         Li Hao had arrived.
         He saw, he saw the light sword surrounded in the middle, surrounded by experts.
         At this moment, every step the light sword took forward, these people would take a step back.
         However, they refused to leave.
         If this went on, the light sword would die without a doubt.
         Li Hao had already seen the light ball that belonged to the light sword. It was very messy and chaotic. This was the drawback caused by the breaking of the superpower lock after the explosion. At this moment, the energy of the superpower lock was overflowing, causing the explosion of the superpower, but it was forcibly suppressed ...  Without even looking, he knew that the inside of the light sword must be a mess.
         Of course, there was also a special energy that seemed to be protecting and trying to repair it. Unfortunately, it was not effective. It seemed that this was the power of light.
         Li Hao didn't approach.
         He looked around and exhaled gently.
         It's really good!
         There were a total of 14 large orbs nearby, representing 14 rising light powerhouses. The weakest among them had the strength of a middle-stage rising light, and there were even two orbs that were slightly glaring!
         Li Hao compared the brightness of the light and found that it was almost as strong as the four great demons. It was stronger than the snake, but not as strong as the other three.
         They might also be in the transformation stage, but they were not as strong as the monster race.
         It should have surpassed the peak of the rising light realm!
         "There are two in the early stage of the Xuguang transformation, four in the peak stage, six in the late stage, and only two in the middle stage ..."
         Li Hao's teeth ached. The arrogance he had just now had disappeared.
         Stop fooling around!
         Where did so many experts come from?
         He originally thought that it was already amazing to be chased by some rays of light. Good Lord, this was not the rays of light. This was all the top experts in the vicinity. If it wasn't for the distance, there might be even more experts rushing over.
         Was there a need to?
         The wind chasing boots is only one of the eight great families "inheritance weapons, why haven't there been so many masters looking for trouble with me?
         A moment later, Li Hao fell into deep thought.
         Perhaps ... He was still afraid of Silver Moon.
         Although Silver moon's old sly foxes did not really take action, it did not mean that no one knew how powerful they were. Hou Xiaochen was a good example, so even though these people did not stand up to protect Li Hao, it had to be said that Silver moon's side had played a part in Li Hao's current situation.
         First, it was Yuan Shuo. Then, it was hou Xiaochen. Now, Li Hao was not weak either. With Silvermoon's protection, there were not many powerful experts in Silvermoon that would go after him.
         The stronger they were, the more they knew how dangerous the Silver Moon was.
         " 14 rising light experts ..."
         Li Hao's head ached. This was only the surrounding area. Who knew if there were more experts hiding in the distance?
         At this moment, Li Hao had silently dived to the bottom of the sea.
          He had just been arrogant, so it was better to keep a low profile now.
         As a Martial Master, it was easy to hide.
         The Sword of Light broke the superpower lock. Otherwise, she would have been able to hide. Unfortunately, her energy was in a mess at the moment. No matter where she hid, she could not escape his observation.
         In the sea, Li Hao quickly thought of how to save the Light sword.
         Although there were many experts, Li Hao was no longer the weakling he was before.
         There was no fear.
         He had seen many experts in the transformation stage, including hou Xiaochen and the others. When the earth overturning sword and Southern Fist were unsealed, they had already surpassed Xu Guang's level. In heaven battling city, the silver awakened had the strength of a transformation stage expert, and when gold awakened, they were even more powerful.
         Li Hao, who had seen all of this, was much more knowledgeable than before.
         He quickly calculated. At this moment, the best way was to restore the Sword of Light. After that, she would be powerful enough to fight against those peak Sunglow and metamorphosis stage cultivators.
         As for the late-stage and mid-stage, there were a total of eight of them. Gou 'Zi had no problem dealing with one of them, and Li Hao had no difficulty dealing with one of them ...
        
         However, it was still far from enough.
         Of course, the prerequisite was that the light sword could be restored.
         Otherwise, everything would be nonsense.
         Her combat strength was not greater than her numbers. Once her momentum rose and her Sword of Light recovered, these people would not dare to fight her.
         "I wonder if I can get close to the light sword if I dive to the bottom of the sea ..." He thought.
         Li Hao stayed in the sea and looked into the distance. However, at this moment, there was actually another superhuman at the foot of the light sword. He was a late-stage sunrise super, a Water-type superhuman. This was one of the reasons why the light sword did not go into the sea at this time.
         There were also people in the sea.
         "There are too many powerhouses ..."
         The key was that he couldn't help the Sword of Light recover its combat power, which was also one of the huge difficulties.
         At this moment, Li Hao heard a voice.""She doesn't seem to be able to hold on much longer. I'll make a move."
          Li Hao, who was full of confidence, naturally had confidence.
         However, at this moment, after hearing this, he still frowned and sent a message,""You alone ... There are so many sunguangs and even existences in the metamorphosis stage. This might not be all of them. The light sword is now half useless. If you attack ... You can kill them all. Otherwise, there will be a lot of trouble in the future."
         "Should I try unsealing it?"
         "Martial uncle, aren't you afraid of wasting the divine energy stones?"
         "They're both silver Moon martial masters, and they're all members of the Seven Swords. I'm the only one who's free in the entire Silver Moon, and those guys in the central continent are a bit far away. After thinking about it, I think I'm the only one who can take action ..."
         ? Yes, Hong Yitang.
         With Li Hao's wariness, knowing that many experts would come this time, how could he not make any preparations and come directly?
         Before he left the ruins, he had already sent a message to Hong Yitang when he was a thousand miles away from swords gate. His original intention was to follow and protect him, but now, Hong Yitang wanted to make a move.
         The reason was simple, they were both silver Moon martial masters.
         The light sword had encountered some trouble while he was outside. As an earth overturning sword, he still wanted to take action.
         "Junior Master, if you were to unseal yourself as well ... Given the situation with the light sword, I'll help you and her at the same time ... Let's not talk about how much it'll consume, more importantly, I might not even have enough time!"
         If Hong Yitang was unsealed, and with the light sword, it would definitely be more troublesome than the southern Fist.
         The light sword was in a terrible state!
         Hong Yitang sent another message."So be it. Li Hao, Silver Moon isn't big, and there aren't many martial masters. You might not have experienced it for now, but you'll understand when you go to the central continent. When you're away from home, it's better to come from your hometown. At least when you run into some trouble, there are Silver Moon martial masters who are willing to stand up for you ... And it's because of this that Silver Moon martial masters are famous."
         "Otherwise, no matter how strong the Silver Moon Martial Master is, he won't be able to fight against so many people."
         "It's only right for you to ask those guys for money. They deserved it. As for the light sword ... There's no need to resolve some grudges. If you can't do it, just ask your teacher to look for her ... But you have to save her now. If you save her, there will be a lot of Silver Moon martial masters to save you in the future!"
         "I'll attract their attention first. You look for an opportunity to take the radiant sword away ... If you can heal, then do it as quickly as possible. Don't worry about me for now. Just recover as much as you can. "
          Li Hao frowned.  It wasn't a big deal if Hong Yitang wanted to take action, but Li Hao really couldn't guarantee that he could quickly help the two suppress the riot when Hong Yitang was unsealed. Moreover, this place was still very dangerous.
         Be careful of the big fish hiding in the dark.
         Hong Yitang wasn't his subordinate, either. He didn't come here just for Li Hao. When he knew that the light sword was in danger, he had decided to come.
         Li Hao had only given him some information in passing.
         While Li Hao was deep in thought, the ocean started to surge.
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just as the light sword was in despair, its expression suddenly changed.
         At the same time, some experts who were hiding their identities also looked in the same direction.
         In the distance, a man with a long sword in his hand stepped on the waves.
         Hong Yitang didn't hide his identity.
         Just like that, he directly walked over. Someone seemed to have recognized him. His eyes changed slightly, and a cold voice resounded,""Earth-shattering sword Hong Yitang?"
         The Silver Moon Martial Master is here?
         In an instant, many people looked around, but they only saw Hong Yitang.
         Hong Yitang revealed a smile."The Silvermoon Seven Swords might not like each other, but all of you are ganging up to bully a woman. Don't you think that's too much?"
         "Too much?"
         Someone sneered.
          The earth overturning sword had arrived ... How laughable.
         If it had been the heavenly Sword, everyone would have been a little apprehensive. However, it was only the earth overturning sword. What was there to be worried about with this guy who had long been crippled?
         "They say that the Silver Moon martial masters are strange. They fight inside until their heads are bleeding, but they are United outside. They are brave and fierce. The number one silver Moon Martial Master ... It seems like I've learned something new today. I didn't think that you, overhand sword, would come instead of the others ..."
         At this moment, many people's attention was drawn to the earth overturning sword.
         The light sword, on the other hand, had a complicated look in his eyes. He looked around, but did not see Li Hao, which made his expression even more complicated.
         The earth overturning sword had come, but it might not be of any use.
         She wanted to see Li Hao more.
         Unfortunately, she also knew that Li Hao was already at his limit when he waited in Silver Moon to save her after she threatened him last time. Why would he take the risk to come and save her?
         As for the arrival of the overbearing sword, she was surprised, but not really surprised.
         Sometimes, the Silver Moon martial masters were a bunch of awkward people.
