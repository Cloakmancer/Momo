In the end, he quickly made a decision."Human King, don't leave!" Su Yu shouted in a low voice."Everyone, this is for real!"As soon as these words were spoken, the experts who had been besieging the two tier 9 experts seemed to have received some sort of order. In an instant, there were some changes again.Venerable sovereign calamity's face changed!F * ck!There's more?‚Äã What were these people doing?The New World had just been established, and it was already terrifying that Su Yu and his group had come this far. What other means did he have?Su Yu sighed and exhaled.The civilization book appeared instantly!In just a moment, it seemed to have become a world. The river of civilization flowed. At this moment, it was as if countless creatures in the myriad world were watching. One page, one realm, the realm ... Was actually brought out by him!The true infinite worlds had long become empty shells!"Heaven and earth, open!"With a low shout, the chaos instantly cleared up the sky and earth. Split open the sky!Yes, split open the sky.Or rather, he had long created his own world in the infinite worlds. At this moment, he had just transferred the world he created into the true chaos.Heaven and earth were split open!In an instant, countless great DAOs appeared. At this moment, the powerful beings of the myriad worlds all turned into the spirits of the great DAOs. The great DAOs above their heads instantly connected with the civilization book.In an instant, a long river appeared. The long river of the universe!Su Yu exhaled. Zhan, you said that I'm still a little short of breaking the limits of the past and the new Sky. You said that it's your time, but you're wrong, it's not!I, only walk my own path.The universe. The chaos was also a universe.From top to bottom, from all four directions, from ancient times until now, it was all my Dao!"Open!"A long river appeared, and a loud sound reverberated. The experts of the myriad world instantly turned into the great Dao, like the spirits of the great Dao. Wrong, they were the spirits of the great Dao in the first place. The experts of the myriad world were different from the experts of the chaos.Many of them had integrated into the great Dao and the new Sky of the universe.He had completely transformed into a Dao spirit!Like divine text, the entire battlefield instantly turned into a chaotic world. Su Yu held the civilization book, and all the experts of the myriad worlds became one of them.In an instant, a suppressive force suddenly appeared.New Sky suppression!Venerable Lord calamity's expression changed slightly. Venerable Lord of life and death and another rank nine also quickly gathered toward the calamity. The three experts 'expressions changed slightly.Damn it!At that moment, the few grade-9 cultivators who were heading straight for the human King realm also sensed the problem and rushed toward the disaster.Seeing this, human King and alt human King also quickly turned back.He looked at Su Yu. At this moment, Su Yu had turned all the experts of the ten thousand worlds into the spiritual great Dao, the nomological great Dao, and the laws in his heaven and earth. They seemed to be somewhat unstable.It seemed that something was missing. At this moment, huntian's expression suddenly changed. Su Yu looked at huntian and smiled,""You took my things and still want to deal with me? how can it be that easy? fellow Daoist, please help me!"As soon as he finished speaking, a brush appeared in his hand, and he wrote spring and autumn!The laws appeared!"Order appears! Tier 9 collapse!"The six huge words instantly flew towards huntian. Huntian's expression was a little ugly. He instantly suppressed the violent order power in his body. In your dreams!However, at that moment, Su Yu reached out and a person appeared.Force Emperor said with a helpless look! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Su Yu chuckled."Martial Emperor, the chaotic world has appeared. You are the one who will quell the chaos. I'm counting on you!"The Martial Emperor kept swearing!It's me again!Without saying anything else, a powerful force suddenly appeared and huntian's expression changed. Originally, only the power of order in his body was turbulent, but at this moment, the power of Chaos also fluctuated violently!He instantly understood!Chaos!Damn it, this person is the reincarnation of chaos!Fortunately, he had already reincarnated, so his control of the chaos great Dao was limited. At this moment, he only stirred the chaos power in his body. Coupled with the turbulence of the order power, the two extreme Dao had some conflicts.Even though it was uncomfortable, he could still suppress it.His face was cold as he stood still. Although the other party had shaken the power of the great Dao in his body, it was impossible for him to control him and let him help him block the strong enemy.His opponents, on the other hand, were charging straight at Su Yu."Small tricks!" Venerable sovereign calamity also shouted.Split open the sky?In front of them, it was not bad to create a small world called bed covering and strengthen the spirits of everyone. However, compared to the yin and yang sides of the human King just now, it was not enough.Even if they were strong, there was a limit to their strength.Do you think this is a small place like Xintian?This was chaos!True chaos!When Li Hao opened the sky, he could only find a place to seal the sky. What were you thinking by opening the sky?The human King and the little human King were extremely fast as they charged towards the four powerful beings.Obviously, he, who had just said that he was going to run, stopped when he saw that Su Yu was serious.As for Su Yu, a sword also appeared in his hand. It was quite powerful, even more powerful than the firmament sword from before. This was also transformed by firmament. At this moment, it cut through the firmament, comparable to Li Hao's slaughter of gods and demons.However, this was not enough.Even if he were to be on par with Li Hao, it would be useless. He wouldn't be able to kill these people.Especially the tribulations within, they were rather powerful.The Thunderbolts emerged, and life and death were reversed. Calamity, venerable Emperor of life and death, and the other two also made their moves at the same time. They wanted to kill Su Yu, not giving him a chance.In the distance, huntian was still suppressing the violence in his body.He sneered. It's good that he's dead. If he's dead, the power of order and chaos in his body will no longer be turbulent. These people still want to scheme against me. I'm not afraid of living chaos, let alone dead chaos!

What was he thinking!As for Su Yu, at this moment, a sky appeared above his head, and thousands of DAOs converged. Even if some of the DAOs were very weak, at this moment, it seemed like someone was controlling them. Countless laughter rang out like demonic sounds."Brother, come play!""Big brother, I'm here ..."Su Yu frowned slightly. LAN Tian's clone was starting to torment him again. It was really uncomfortable.At the same time, within huntian's body, the order formed by the countless rule force started to move as if it had a life of its own. In an instant, the countless rule force started to shake violently!Huntian's expression changed!No... This power of order ... Seems to be alive.How could this be?Yes, it was alive.The nomological power of the myriad worlds was very similar to order, but they were different, after all. They were not completely the same. The DAOs of the myriad worlds were all nomological DAOs. They were all sentient, and DAOs were all integrated by people.Almost all DAOs were.The power of order in his body seemed to have millions of thoughts at this moment. In an instant, an extremely crazy thought rushed into the sky and became chaotic."Kill him!""No, you can't kill ...""I love him!""Where's mommy?""I want to cultivate the Dao ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe countless thoughts were extremely chaotic and jumbled up. Huntian groaned in pain as his thoughts were affected.He was shocked!What was this? p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  As for Su Yu, he knew very well what it was. It was LAN Tian's consciousness. He had tens of thousands of clones and integrated into all worlds. His consciousness had long gone crazy, and even LAN Tian's main body was often in chaos.In the entire river of time, Su Yu did not melt, but someone did. Blue sky!The power of order and rule force that had been extracted earlier had almost all been integrated into Blue Sky's spirituality.To dare to absorb the power of the myriad world and the power of rules ... That was not an ordinary kind of courage.Su Yu thought to himself. Seeing that the three calamity grades had already attacked and were about to destroy his new world, he laughed and suddenly disappeared. The three of them were shocked!Teleportation?Space?He wanted to run!In an instant, the three shook the space as if they wanted to shake him out. But at this moment, the Lord of calamity suddenly frowned and looked up. In the depths of the chaos great Dao, something seemed to be touching his calamity great Dao.Su Yu disappeared in an instant.Huntian, who was still suppressing the violence in his body, suddenly changed his expression. Not good, this person ... Was staring at him!"Get lost!" A fierce shout exploded from his mouth, and a powerful force burst out!The Emperor of the new heaven actually wanted to deal with him. Why?It's not like I'm the one who's been pestering him!Even though the energy in his body was going berserk, even though countless wills were attacking him, at this moment, he still burst out with a powerful force, shaking the void and trying to force this group of people to retreat.He didn't want to be the next expert to fall.At this moment, calamity and the others were about to continue their pursuit, but they seemed to have hesitated for a moment after sensing the calamity. Life and death and the others were slightly stunned.Watch the Tigers fight?Was it appropriate?Huntian had also been their opponent just now, but now he chose to watch from the side. Was he not going to do anything?"What?" Jie Nan's expression changed. He sensed the chaos great Dao again, but he did not continue forward. Instead, he chose to stop. On the other side, huntian Supreme Emperor was furious!The power of order and chaos instantly erupted!The power of the two extremes burst out in the blink of an eye!The void instantly trembled. At first, it was extremely chaotic, but in an instant, it seemed to be restored to order, as if it had turned into a barrier that completely locked down the space!You want to kill me? dream on!At the same time, a unique energy suddenly began to spread out. Huntian felt a sense of familiarity, and in an instant, the energy began to madly spread. Huntian had sensed it!This was ... The power of faith!That's right, he had seen it in Silver moon's place before. His face slightly changed. That powerful power of faith and the way of responsibility had fused with the order power in the blink of an eye.It was extremely compatible!A puppet!At this moment, huntian finally understood what these guys were up to. They still wanted to control him through this special great Dao of faith. The power of order that they had given him before had fused with this great Dao of responsibility!In other words ... The rules of the myriad worlds had actually been controlled by the human Emperor before. The human Emperor of the myriad worlds ... Was not Su Yu! Yes, it was not Su Yu.It was another person!He had always thought that the human Emperor of the myriad worlds was Su Yu, but it turned out that was not the case. The Dao of the myriad worlds had actually been invaded by another person, including the river of time before. In fact, Su Yu did not occupy it, but the blue sky occupied it.This also caused huntian, who had been mainly on guard against Su Yu, to let out a muffled groan at this moment. His expression changed drastically. Two Special Forces were crazily invading his body and everything about him!"Calamity!" He roared,"you idiot, they want to control me!"Not to kill him, but to control him, to make him their puppet!Damn it!"Killing me won't have much of an impact on the Tribulation. But once I'm controlled, these people will have an extremely powerful helper. That'll be the real trouble for the Tribulation!Venerable sovereign calamity frowned. Control?That won't do!In an instant, he made his move. The chaos lightning tribulation appeared and went straight for Su Yu, trying to shatter Su Yu's world.

Huntian immediately heaved a sigh of relief!He also quickly restrained the two consciousnesses in his body and cursed inwardly. What kind of messed up Dao did these people from the myriad world cultivate? someone's will was in such a mess, yet he was still alive. That abnormal will kept attacking him.Where did this lunatic come from? can this be cultivated into Dao?There was another person who had obviously been brainwashed. At this moment, countless wills were attacking him, as if telling him to protect the human race well. Protect your granddaddy ...Huntian cursed in his heart!At this level, protecting or not protecting was a joke.He actually wanted to change the will of a 9th rank, what a joke.Su Yu had quite a few tricks up his sleeve.It's a pity ... You still won't succeed!If you want to kill me, the Tribulation may not care. If you want to control me, they will definitely not ignore it.Just as he was thinking about it, Su Yu suddenly laughed. It was a perverted and arrogant laugh."Control you? you think you're worthy?""What?"As this thought emerged, huntian was suddenly shocked!"Li Hao, I'll return it!"In an instant, the sky above him suddenly exploded, and the extremely dense power of the great Dao instantly collapsed.A powerful force swept out in all directions.In the distance, Li Hao dodged again and glanced in that direction. In just an instant, a powerful force swept over. Even the three dark shadows were shocked again and cursed in their hearts!Why was there so much trouble today?Self-destruction?Why did Emperor Yu self-destruct when he had just walked out of the new heaven?This is crazy!In fact, it wasn't a self-explosion, but a new Sky. In an instant, heaven and earth seemed to collapse, and light once again illuminated the chaos! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Su Yu's mouth was bleeding.With a laugh, the new Sky exploded in an instant, completely destroying the power of the great DAOs of the calamity group and blocking them!Huntian Supreme Emperor suddenly spat out blood!Whether it was order or chaos in his body, they all exploded one after another with this explosion. The power of order collapsed again, and the chaos began to devour him, causing him to be injured quite badly in the blink of an eye!"You lunatic ..." He couldn't help but curse.Self-destructing his new world just to destroy the order in his body?Wasn't this crazy?You're also injured!And it's even heavier than mine.Wasn't this the same as Li Hao when he split open the sky? he would only be happy if he crippled himself?Are you all the same?Did they all like to self-destruct their own great DAOs?Was he that happy to self-destruct his great Dao? "What do you know!"Su Yu sneered, and in an instant, a book appeared again. Suddenly, the blood that huntian and the others spat out disappeared and was absorbed by the book.In the blink of an eye, blood appeared in Su Yu's hands!The drops of blood seemed to be crystal clear.He looked at Li Hao in the distance and smiled.""I've already destroyed all of your power for your enemy. Now, I've swallowed blood to be born and reorganized the 10000 DAOs. This has nothing to do with you!"I don't want it even if you give it to me."New heaven is too small, and the great Dao is incomplete. I don't want it either. The group of grade-9 experts here are fighting now, and blood is splattering everywhere. As for me ... I'm naturally bloodthirsty!Most of the experts in the myriad world live by swallowing blood!What do you mean by the 50 great DAOs? I can't break through the limit. I will use the ninth-grade blood essence to reform the 10000 DAOs and break free from the restrictions of the new heaven and 10000 worlds. I will swallow blood to be reborn and absorb the power of Chaos to prove the Dao of chaos again!Li Hao, this time, we're done!In an instant, a large amount of blood was devoured by him.It was as if countless great DAOs had been devoured by him and turned into divine text. The divine text quickly reassembled and, in the blink of an eye, turned into a book that was integrated into the civilization book!An extremely greedy and comfortable moan came out of his mouth,""The blood of a chaos expert is indeed different ..."Abnormal!Many people instantly cursed.This freak was devouring everyone's blood. In the chaos, when experts fought, devouring the power of great DAOs was common, but devouring the blood essence of others ... Was a legitimate evil path!The human King's dark side emerged. Su Yu was born from blood, and Li Hao was a demonic cultivator ...This group of people were the true demons!Compared to them, be it tier 9, huntian, or tianfang, they all seemed to be upright gentlemen in the world.These three people were the true evil existences!The moment the blood was swallowed by Su Yu, it was as if it was being reorganized. However, this was not enough. Huntian's expression suddenly changed. Just as he was about to retreat, Su Yu instantly approached him and covered him with blood!He seemed to have turned into a blood demon!"Your blood ... Your power is mine!"In an instant, Su Yu's will seemed to have split apart. Thousands of traces of will instantly merged into huntian's body, shocking him!How could this be? In the infinite worlds, it wasn't just one person who was suffering from schizophrenia. There were two!At this moment, countless laughter could be heard.There were men and women, old and young. LAN Tian's laughter was demonic."Otherwise, how could he be the Emperor Yu? My big brother Emperor Yu is the real pervert ..."Splitting consciousness!LAN Tian admitted that he was inferior to Emperor Yu.There was no other reason. The Emperor Yu in front of him had been killed every day since he was young, and his mind had been split time and time again. He was a true lunatic through and through. He had cultivated countless divine characters, and each divine character had a different personality.He had the same amount of consciousness as the number of pages in the civilization book!He was the real pervert!Of course, LAN Tian felt that Su Yu was a pervert. Few people dared to say that he was just a little weak, so everyone scolded him. They never dared to scold Su Yu. They were all guys who bullied the weak and feared the strong!

3813 Chapter 616
Countless wills covered huntian.Huntian suddenly felt the blood in his body drain at a rapid rate. Not only that, but his will was also beginning to blur."Death is not scary ... Death is just a nap. Be good, I'll inherit your last will ..."That mental energy was terrifyingly powerful. It was as if it had been tempered thousands of times as it madly attacked huntian!Huntian's expression changed drastically!It was resisting this special, crazy spiritual energy attack.Su Yu seemed to be merging into huntian's body bit by bit. Countless drops of blood covered huntian and merged into his body. Every drop of blood was stained with madness and hysteria!He had spent countless days and nights in fear, panic, and death.On the first day of cultivation, he began to absorb blood essence and devour blood to cultivate.In just a few short years, he had killed countless people and killed everyone in the heavens!Only after killing all of his enemies could the myriad world reach its current state. Only then could it truly be unified. At this moment, a unified will seemed to have sensed something and erupted forth madly.Su Yu chuckled, his voice extremely gentle.""You want to unify the world? You can't do it, but I did. So ... Your will is nothing in my eyes. Instead, it is extremely compatible with me!""Do you know why I chose you the moment I walked out and allowed you to inherit the power of natural order ... Because ... I sensed your strong will. You want to unify the chaos? Unfortunately, you can't do it ... But I can!"The fake chaos was still chaos!I'm the only one who has unified the chaos and the universe!Even Li Hao and Fang ping could not do it. Only I am the Emperor who unified the chaos!The will of the Grand unity is useless to me. On the contrary, it suits me better.Huntian ... The moment I saw you, I fell in love with you, did you know that?Su Yu's laughter resounded, but it came from huntian's mouth.It was extremely shocking!A powerful will, a crazy will, crazily compressing huntian's will. Huntian seemed to be at a loss. A great unification was his lifelong pursuit ...However, he had never been able to complete it!At this moment, the power of the blood essence in his body was flowing crazily. The power of Chaos and order were also gathering toward Su Yu's will. Even the most determined will of unity was also gathering toward Su Yu.Su Yu's laughter was demonic."You and Mo Yan are both pursuing the unity of chaos ... I once observed some things in the long river. Before Mo Yan reincarnated, perhaps, he had the same thoughts as you. Perhaps, you two even know each other ..."Long Zhan!Huntian had such a thought. He only felt that it was becoming more and more ethereal. He seemed to be losing control of himself as the blood in his body was being crazily extracted!Even his will was collapsing.Long Zhan ... Am I going to follow in your footsteps?"He's trying to possess me!"At this moment, the few tier 9 experts who had been pushed back by Xin Tian's self-explosion finally realized something. They were all shocked!Possession!At this level, who would try to possess someone?Not to mention that the great Dao was not compatible, besides, everyone was an expert with strong will. If you had the ability to possess, you could already reforge your own body. Why would you need to possess others?However, this Emperor Yu was actually ... Possessing huntian!This was also a demonic technique!In an instant, the group of people felt a chill in their hearts. Everything was a conspiracy. This group of people had given chaos heaven the Dao of order. From that moment on, it had become the greatest conspiracy. Order had been corrupted by this group of people, by Emperor Yu.Huntian's insistence on the will of unity satisfied the other party's needs.This person had truly completed the chaos 'Dao of grand unification.At this moment, this unified spirit of will even took the initiative to abandon huntian and move closer to Su Yu!Su Yu's laughter came out of huntian's mouth, with a hint of gloominess,""Possession? Wrong, it wasn't possession. It was just ... Inheritance! Since huntian can't do it, then I'll complete his last wish! "As you can see, it was his blood that chose me. It was his spirit that chose me. It was his will that crumbled on its own ...."He seemed to be explaining, but also seemed to be mocking.Alright, he admitted it. It was a possession!As for his body being destroyed and turned into energy, he was used to it. Where did he get his own body from? his body had been completely gone long ago when he had become a dead spirit. He had experienced death too many times.It was no big deal.At this moment, huntian's own painful wailing came out of his mouth,""Bastard ... You can kill me ... Why ... Do you have to do this ..."Possession!This was something that had never happened before in the ninth rank, no, even among the venerable sovereigns.A top-notch existence had actually possessed him!How hateful!More importantly, his willpower was no match for the other party. Why was that?"The other party isn't at the ninth step. I'm the one who has truly stepped into the ninth step!" "Because ... The energy in your body is rich!"Su Yu's laughter also came from huntian's mouth, as if there were two sides to one body. At this moment, his laughter emerged,""I can't break the restrictions Li Hao imposed on me, but I think I'll be able to break them once I merge with this chaos. Scholars should simplify things, the simpler the better ... Brother huntian, I'll take good care of your energy ... Please go!""Bastard!""Stop him ..."Outside, a few experts attacked madly, but they were once again blocked by the exploding heaven and earth energy.And just at this moment ... There was a loud boom!It was as if heaven and earth were roaring!Chaos trembled as chaotic energy swept out in all directions. Huntian's body instantly crumbled and turned into blood as a powerful intent absorbed all the energy.The power of order instantly became one!"Enough!" A cold and stern voice rang out."Martial Emperor, that's enough! Stop stirring the chaotic energy!"In the void, the Martial Emperor's figure did not appear, but he instantly stopped snatching.He cursed in his heart ... Although he had recovered some of his chaotic memories, he immediately gave up the idea of snatching the chaos Avenue when he thought of Su Yu, that ruthless guy.This lunatic will kill me!It's not scary to kill me, but this grandson might bury me, strip me naked, and let the heroes of the chaos admire me for countless years. That's too cruel!I've experienced it once, and I don't want to do it again!BOOM!With a loud bang, a bloody figure appeared where hun Tian had been. The bloody figure gradually melted, and a moment later, a person in white clothes appeared, returning to Su Yu's appearance!He revealed a smile and raised his hand as if he was adapting to his new body. His smile was bright."What powerful blood. The power of the blood of a chaos expert is indeed powerful. I think the chaos experts have yet to develop it. Why don't ... Let me devour their blood? I'll definitely surpass all experts!""The infinite worlds have this sort of experience. Many years of experience ... Hahaha!"The demonic sound reverberated and shook everyone's hearts!Even Tian Fang was frowning at this moment. A bunch of Devils! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This Su Yu ... He had thought that the Imperial aura was rich, but in the end ... He had actually swallowed blood and possessed a body!In comparison, the human King's dark side didn't seem to be much.As for Li Hao, although he was ruthless and heartless, compared to this person ... He seemed ... Seemed to be able to accept it. At least, Li Hao did not drink blood!"Another devil!"In the distance, Spring Autumn was sent flying backward. He muttered and cursed in his heart!In this day and age, only by becoming a true demon could one survive?I also want to become a demon!Previously, when the human king and emperor Yu looked miserable, she was still very happy. In the end ... Was she the only one who was truly miserable?These people were all hiding!Damn it!I'm really miserable!Huntian, the expert who was determined to unify the chaos and complete the establishment of order, was actually ... Possessed by a pseudo-Chaos Emperor. It was unbelievable!

3814 Chapter 617
Huntian was dead.The Grand unification that he had pursued for his entire life had finally died at the hands of Su Yu.He had died at the hands of a fake Chaos Emperor.Li Hao's opening of the sky had also brought about the desired result. The people of the ten thousand worlds had pinned down several level 9s and killed huntian, who had achieved the Dao of order and chaos. Li Hao's expectations had been fulfilled.After the three of them, another powerhouse who had just reached type 9 had died.This was also the most powerful being born in the chaos in the past million years. Perhaps, he would also be the last grade 9 cultivator.Li Hao and the others had yet to reach level 9.The faces of calamity and the others were extremely solemn.Three generations of time were also demons.A blood-devouring demon!The second generation Li Hao was also a demon.Although Fang ping was not from the first generation, he was from new martial arts, from the world where the first generation was. He was the king of that world. This lineage was full of Devils. Fang Ping's dark side was also shocking.Of the 20-odd rank-9s, only four had died so far ... Including chaos and five elements, only six had died.There were still many people alive.But at this moment, everyone was a little depressed.A million years of self-sealing was not waiting for the stability of time, but ... The birth of three generations of demons.As for their leader back then, Tian Fang...He had always harbored other thoughts. Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  At this moment, even Tian Fang, who had yet to fully recover, was not at a disadvantage while resisting the siege of five tier 9 experts. Was this all Tian Fang could do?What was he planning?At this moment, the master of the calamity felt despair for no reason. Perhaps, in Tian Fang's eyes, they were all just pawns.Huntian's death didn't seem to surprise Tian Fang.The deaths of Yin Yang and the others could not move him.He seemed to be waiting for something.It seemed that he had been paying attention to Li Hao's group all this time, even creating opportunities for them, buying them time, and creating all kinds of opportunities.Tian Fang...What do you want to do?The Tribulation didn't attack Su Yu again. Instead, it turned to look at Li Hao in the distance and laughed crazily."Li Hao, the two of them have revealed their true colors. What about you? What other trump cards do you have? Hurricane, be careful!"Hurricane and the other two also had a serious look on their faces and didn't press forward.Instead, he retreated a little.Fang ping and Su Yu's outburst had killed many powerhouses one after another. As for Li Hao ... Up until now, he had only been entangled with them, but he had not shown his invincible power.These three people ... Not to mention anything else, Li Hao had successfully split open the sky, and the world had nurtured Su Yu. Was Li Hao really inferior to Su Yu?Thinking of this, the three of them became serious and kept retreating.At this moment, Chunqiu could no longer hold it in and stop acting. He roared,""Don't bother about them, save me!"Please save me! In any case, I'm considered to be on the same side as you, right?Now, you all killed your opponents one by one, but what about me?"I was almost completely destroyed by the two rank nines. My clones were almost completely destroyed. If her main body is killed, she'll really be dead."That's enough!" Chunqiu bellowed."Do you really think that only the three of them have a trump card?" I didn't want to kill you, but you forced me to ..."The expressions of the two rank nines surrounding her changed.He retracted his strength slightly and quickly switched from a strong offensive to a defensive one.They weren't easily intimidated, but ... They had learned too much from their mistakes. Several powerful experts had just died, so they didn't dare to be careless. At this moment, although they had clones, they all appeared!At this moment, she seemed to be completely enraged. Tens of thousands of clones appeared and she gritted her teeth."You two bastards, are you done?"After saying that, the thousands of clones gathered toward her."Time Withers and prospers, spring and autumn no longer exist!"With a loud roar, countless withering power appeared, and the two became even more vigilant.The next moment ... The world changed colors as if time and space were in chaos. The world seemed to spin as a demonic wind swept across the world. In an instant, spring and autumn crossed through time and space, disappearing with the great demons!When he reappeared, he had already fled far away, but was rather close to Li Hao.The two grade-9 experts were slightly dazed.They really thought that spring and autumn was about to explode!In the end ... Chunqiu ... Took the opportunity to escape!Damn it!In the distance, Spring Autumn was panting heavily as he cursed in his heart. Where did this 'seed explosion' come from? at least their opponents were two tier 9 experts. It was good enough that they could run away. Fortunately, these guys 'seed explosion earlier had frightened them.He had given him a chance.Otherwise, he would not be able to escape.At this time, of course, staying alive was the most important. Not to mention that I couldn't kill a ninth-rank even if I exploded my seed, even if I could, I would have to stay alive first. I didn't want to fight them to the point of dying together.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe surroundings were silent.Spring Autumn ran away!At this moment, the neo martial human King and Su Yu of the myriad world gathered together. Around them, calamity brought many tier 9 experts. They did not make a move. Seeing that spring and autumn had shaken off the two tier 9 experts, they smiled."Spring Autumn is just a small fry. Don't worry about him, you two. Come over!"The two of them changed their expressions. They didn't say anything more and quickly gathered toward the calamity.The Tribulation no longer cared about Su Yu or Tian Fang. Instead, it looked at the neo martial Supreme and said,""Let them gather!"The tier 9 powerhouse who was fighting the neo martial artists had long lost his composure. At this moment, hearing this, he did not say anything and quickly gathered towards the disaster.At that moment, 10 level 9s gathered together.It surrounded the new martial arts and the experts of the ten thousand worlds.

The calamity didn't attack again, nor did the top ten experts gather together to besiege them just because there were more people and they were stronger. At this moment, he was looking at Tian Fang and even Li Hao.Finally, he looked at Silver Moon Yuan Shuo and smiled.""Come back, let Yuan Shuo and the others meet up ..."On his side, if they gathered now, they had a total of 20 type 9 powerhouses.At this moment, his eyes flickered."Everyone, come back. Since brother tianfang has held back, we shouldn't treat him like this. It's all a misunderstanding!"Tian Fang frowned slightly.As for the devour and the others who had been surrounding him, their expressions changed. They quickly retreated as they fought, gathering towards the calamity.Clearly, the Tribulation at this moment had sensed something and was gathering all the tier 9 experts to gather together for warmth.And now, the situation was complicated.They could not figure out Tian Fang's goal. As for besieging myriad world, neo martial, and silver Moon, at first, he felt that he could succeed very quickly, so he did not care about splitting up his forces. However, at this moment, he clearly felt that something was wrong, so he no longer split his forces.The other rank-9s might have other thoughts as well.However, they could all see some clues.Gradually, the experts started to gather together and no longer attacked one side alone.Yuan Shuo also took a breath and quickly gathered toward neo martial.At this moment, the two sides of the human King continued to absorb the power of great DAOs, while Su Yu continued to consume his heaven chaos power.In the distance, Spring Autumn had not completely escaped.This battle was related to the final direction of chaos. How could she leave so easily? however, at this moment, she was also injured and was rapidly healing. She was even preparing to transform again.When Tian Fang saw this, he didn't stop him. Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The five powerhouses had gathered at calamity's side. At this moment, there were a total of 17 type 9 powerhouses, including calamity himself. The remaining three were with Li Hao. They did not retreat, but they did not attack either. They only stopped Li Hao from going deeper into the Dao of chaos.At this moment, the Tribulation seemed to have completely woken up. It had woken up from its previous arrogance and thought that it was invincible in numbers.He looked at the human King and the others, then at Tian Fang, and smiled.""Although we're all at the ninth rank, we're not invincible among them. Whether it's neo martial artists, Silver Moon, or myriad world, the ultimate enemy is probably not us!""At this point ... Everyone should be able to tell who is the strongest and most intimidating here!""We ... Just want to live!"He seemed to have completely woken up and sighed.""We have no intention of being invincible against anyone. Be it Silver Moon, neo martial, or Tian Fang ... It's not that we want to be your enemy, it's just that ... You've been trying to kill us all this time! "It's not our fault that we became Class 9, and we didn't do it on purpose. The great Dao is like this, and everyone who reached Class 9 is like this. A million years ago, you were the ones who reached Class 9, so you could only do this ..." "We ... Went through so much trouble to cultivate to level nine. We didn't do anything. We just wanted to live on ... Is this ... Also a sin?"He seemed a little sad."For a million years, we sealed ourselves in the depths of chaos because we were worried that we would absorb too much spirituality and the chaos would collapse and be destroyed ... If time can stabilize the chaos, what's wrong with that? Why would he rather explode it than give it to us? why didn't he give us a chance to survive?"He looked at the crowd, at Su Yu, at Fang ping, at Tian Fang, and finally at Li Hao in the distance. His voice was extremely loud."Since we've attained Dao, we've never killed innocents, nor have we invaded heaven and earth, nor have we committed any unpardonable crimes! A million years of self-sealing, whether willing or not, has created a million years of peace, at least ... Relative peace!""We are not the ones who are calculative and have a plan ... We are just waiting for time to stabilize the chaos. Is there anything wrong with that?"At this moment, the type 9 side had many experts.It was not the moment of complete despair.At this moment, he was making such a self-defense statement. Perhaps he was asking these people, or perhaps he was asking chaos, were we wrong?Reaching grade-9 was the pursuit of cultivation.However, grade-9 cultivators absorbed spirituality too quickly. This wasn't their fault. Perhaps it was because the Dao of chaos wasn't perfect and there was a problem with their cultivation method. However, this problem wasn't caused by them.Even if they couldn't reach grade-9, someone else would. As long as someone could, this chaos would definitely reach its current state.‚Äã Calamity asked again,"let's not talk about devouring the various realms.""Those who rise up, be it us or you, who hasn't done it before?" Everyone had done it, so it was not a crime! I just don't understand. At this point ... If Su Yu was willing to contribute time instead of exploding it, perhaps ... This battle could have been avoided!"Su Yu sneered.The human King curled his lips.Could it be avoided?It can 't!Of course, if time was to be preserved, they might still have a chance to stop the fight now that they had displayed their strength."Calamity? is there still any meaning in saying all this now?" the human King directly spoke."There's not much meaning to it. ""No." Calamity shook his head."I'm not saying this to say that the battle is over. I just want to get to the bottom of it! I want to know if time can stabilize chaos. I want to know how to solve the problem of the loss of spirituality. I would also like to know what these people in Primal Chaos are plotting. "He laughed at himself."We don't want to continue fighting for an unknown outcome. We want to know what you are planning." Using so many Grade 9 experts as pawns, what a huge move!"

He then turned to Tian Fang and sneered,""Tian Fang, what do you say?"Tian Fang was silent.Jie Nan's eyes were cold,"from the beginning until now, what are you still hiding?" In the past, what did Zhan say to you and what did he do? From then on, you have been pushing the development of time. You told us that time can stabilize chaos ... We believed you. Of course, we also have reason to believe in the effect of time ... But now?""Are you really unable to stop the explosion of time? You're the space path master. If others can't do it, can't you? Where did your ability to travel through space go? You didn't stop me, why? Tian Fang, I want to know!" "Since you've been pushing for the development of time ... Why did you let time dissipate?"This was what he didn't understand.Tian Fang had actually been waiting for time to grow stronger. However, in the end, Su Yu exploded time. At that time, it was difficult for others to stop him, but the most powerful person was able to fight against five rank nine Tian Fang. At that time, he could pass through and instantly suppress them. Was he really unable to do it?Shi Guang was only at the peak of grade 8.He, a tier 9, really couldn't stop it?He definitely could!But he did not.It was also from that moment on that they no longer trusted Tian Fang. Therefore, they besieged Tian Fang. At this moment, the calamity only made it clear that the chaos today was all secretly incited and directed by Tian Fang.He looked at Su Yu, then at Fang ping, then at Yuan Shuo, and smiled."Tian Fang is the true mastermind behind all of this. I'm not afraid of you. It doesn't matter how much more powerful you are, I just want to know the answer. I'll die to make sure I understand. If possible ... I'm even willing to join forces with you to kill the mastermind! After that, no matter what the result is, it doesn't matter if it's life or death!" no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  "I just don't want everyone to die for no reason ... Or for what reason!""Human King, don't you hate this kind of person? If Tian Fang doesn't want to tell us ... Why do we have to keep fighting and wasting our energy to satisfy him?"The human King's eyebrows twitched.This tribulation ... Was now somewhat interesting. At this point, after seeing their strength after a few people died, this guy actually wanted to join forces with them to deal with Tian Fang!Not far away.The master of tianfang slightly raised his brows, looked at the Tribulation, and said slowly,""We've known each other for many years, and now, you've provoked me again and again. You've been the one leading the tribulations several times. Whether it's an early arrival, besieging Li Hao, or killing Su Yu ... I'm just a bystander at most. Perhaps you're the only one who knows the purpose."As he spoke, he chuckled."The power of the Tribulation has always been in chaos and has never retreated. I just don't want to say more. You said that the spirituality has dissipated and that it hasn't gathered in a million years. Everyone only remembers the sky but has forgotten that the Thunder tribulation zone is the zone that surrounds the four directions! You started all of this and made everyone stand against me. You were willing to be the loser several times and showed your innocence. You ... Are you really innocent?"The Lord of calamity sneered,'my great Dao only has 9500 Dao laws. How can I compare to you? What can I do under your eyes? You've overestimated me!" Tian Fang didn't panic and chuckled,""That's not necessarily true! The power of the Tribulation was not weak. It's said that the power of two extremes is powerful, but everyone has forgotten that tribulations include natural and man-made disasters, chaos, darkness, turmoil, plague, disease, and even punishment, Thunder, and desire. ""Everything that is not good is a catastrophe. The more turbulent the chaos is, the more people will die. The chaos will be in chaos, and the biggest beneficiary will not be space but the catastrophe! The power of the Tribulation is actually constantly increasing. ""No matter how many people die, it's not a big loss to him. On the contrary, it helped him recover his spirituality!" He chuckled."Huntian's body was taken over, and you were right in front of him, but you deliberately stopped. You ... How can you talk about me?"As soon as he said that, everyone's eyes flashed.The expressions of the grade 9 experts around calamity changed.Tribulation ... The Thunder region used to envelop the square region. Could Tian Fang's words be trusted?Perhaps ... It made sense.The Lord of calamity sneered."If I really did that, I wouldn't have let everyone gather. Instead, I would have continued to fight and strengthen my spirituality. Tian Fang, you don't make sense!"Tian Fang chuckled,"why would I?" Isn't it normal to give you some time to digest the spirit? "If people keep dying, and they're all experts, aren't you afraid that you won't be able to absorb all of them? Tribulations are everywhere, natural disasters and man-made disasters are everywhere. "At this moment, the human King seemed to have come to a realization.""It turns out that the two of you are sinister villains of the ninth rank. I think the two of you plan to kill the other ninth rank combatants to satisfy your own needs, right?""Human King's words ..."Tian Fang laughed."You've reached the limit of acting dumb. Why do you have to do this?"The human King laughed."I'm not like you. You're so shameless. You even tricked your own friends!" Look at me, did I cheat my friend? Look at all of you, all of you have been cultivating to this day. Do you have a friend that you can rest assured of?"Tian Fang sighed and nodded slightly,""That's true! That's why they say that the great Dao is emotionless. When one cultivates to the extreme, one's emotions will be obliterated. "At this moment, it could be considered a confrontation between three parties.Silvermoon's three sides, and perhaps spring and autumn 's.The Tribulation group.In addition ... There was Tian Fang, who was alone.

And this person also made people extremely afraid. Some of the words of the Tribulation might just be exaggerated by him, but there was one sentence that was right. Tian Fang was very strong and had always been scheming.Even the explosion of time did not make him lose his composure. This fellow was unfathomable.He was also the only one who had gathered 10000 Dao laws and truly had 10000 Dao laws.He fought five grade-9 experts alone and was not at a disadvantage. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  The human King didn't care about all this. At this moment, his smile was bright,""I don't care. You guys have too many schemes. I'm not interested. If you really want to kill him, it's not impossible to join forces!"After saying that, he looked into the distance and said with a smile,""Then, Li Hao and the others ... I think you should retreat too. Li Hao is crippled, why are you keeping an eye on him?"Crippled?He had been fighting three tier 9 experts all by himself, and up until now, nothing had happened to him. Now, you're saying he's crippled?Did he really think that everyone was blind?If Tian Fang was a schemer, then Li Hao wasn't a kind person either.Su Yu was born when the sky was split open. Now, Su Yu led the experts of the myriad worlds to kill huntian, stop some level 9s, and shift everyone's attention away from Li Hao ... Who would believe that Li Hao didn't have any plans?The Tribulation didn't say anything else. It just looked at Tian Fang and said seriously,""Tianfang, let me ask you. Other than time and chaos, is there really no other place that can accommodate a tier 9? Or ... Will time reappear?"He didn't believe that it would really end here!If that was the case, why wasn't Tian Fang anxious at all?His 20,000 years of lifespan was already up. Even if a tier 9 could live, this fellow's end was also approaching."Time has always existed."Tian Fang didn't care about this at this moment and said softly,""Time has always been there. It's right beside us, right in front of our eyes. Every moment is passing. Time ... Has never disappeared."What did that mean? Everyone naturally knew that time had always been passing, but the great Dao was different from these.The master of tianfang didn't say anything more and just continued,""The disappearance of spirituality is actually related to the disorder of chaos. The order of the ten thousand worlds has actually been growing ever since it was created. Otherwise, when the sky was split open, we only absorbed some of its spirit. Now, with so many experts of the myriad world being born, the spirit is very dense ... Thus, as the intelligence is developed, the spirit is actually constantly increasing!""Spirituality is not a unique energy. Instead ... It is a continuous sublimation of the spirit!""Wisdom, civilization, and order all help strengthen spirituality. Chaos is too disorderly, so spirituality is dissipating."Tian Fang looked at Su Yu. At this moment, he was a little interested in Su Yu. He chuckled and said,""My young friend, Su Yu, I think the spirituality of the myriad world has been growing stronger with the establishment of rules and order, right? "Your era should be stronger than the time of the sky opening. It shouldn't be getting weaker and weaker. If it gets weaker and weaker, it'll be chaos. A million years ago, there's a huge difference. In the past, many rank nines were born, but today, only chaos heaven barely stepped into rank nine with the help of your spirit of the myriad worlds ..."Su Yu didn't argue and nodded.""In the chaotic era, spirituality will definitely dissipate, and the rules will no longer exist! When the world was united, the people would be United. Everyone would strive to cross the river, cultivate, perfect, and develop. The crystallization of wisdom would become stronger and stronger, and naturally, it would make its spirituality stronger! In other words, the natural order is constantly growing stronger!"Tian Fang seemed to have obtained the result he wanted."That's why the spiritual nature of grade-9 existences is constantly being consumed. In fact, it's because of the disorder of rules and the collapse of order. The master of order in the past established order, which was the right path ..." "We don't want to kill him. Since you said so, why did you kill him back then?" Jie Nan sneered.Tian Fang shook his head,"I didn't want to kill him. He ... Wanted to die!" "Or rather, he's seeking his own death. A calamity. Do you think that if you forcefully suppress the darkness under order, regardless of anything, you can establish true order? It could only be said that the master of order was too anxious. He did not really suppress the disorder and was only pretending to be peaceful. It would erupt sooner or later! "Chaos and turmoil can not be suppressed like this. They must be purged and reformed. If he has the ability, he can kill all of us and then rebuild order. In fact, it is not wrong for huntian to leave, but unfortunately, he is not strong enough!"Everyone's hearts stirred when they heard this.The Tribulation seemed to have gained some understanding, and the gazes of the other rank-9 cultivators all changed."What you mean is ... To kill all those who are creating chaos and restore order to chaos is your Dao of order?" Bring chaos back to order? As for the master of order, because he is not strong enough and not ruthless enough ... In your opinion, his order will collapse sooner or later, just like the West ...""You can understand it that way."Tian Fang nodded."Of course, we don't have to rely on killing. We can educate and tame them. Look at the chaos now. Aren't they all very obedient?"He pointed at the Martial Emperor and laughed,""Look at chaos, he's so well-behaved now! From the beginning, I didn't advocate killing. From the beginning to the end, I didn't support the use of killing to solve all problems, so most of the time, I just watched from the side. "At this moment, he didn't mind saying what was on his mind. He sighed,""But the world is like this. Some people are still unwilling to accept it, and some people are not convinced. So, just as Zhan said, this world might still need a blade wielder to come out and kill all the turmoil ... Huntian placed his hopes on the ninefold guards to be the executors of the darkness. He overestimated the ninefold guards!"

Tian Fang shook his head.The ninefold guards were very strong, but that was only relative. They could not move the true powerhouses.He then looked at Fang ping and the others,"you're all from the yin-yang world, or should I say ... The time world!" "Zhan left behind some inheritances and some achievements to create you all. In truth, he is also choosing a saber wielder! He wasn't suitable, or rather, he wasn't willing to, but you guys dared to ruin Shi Guang's reputation. Actually, Su Yu, I think you're more than qualified! "As for Fang Ping, he's able to give up time and not be tainted by it. In fact, he also has the right to do so ... Li Hao is also qualified!""The three of you can actually meet the requirements of the battle."Tian Fang sighed."I didn't expect that what I said in the past would come true. The war once said that in every chaotic era, someone would come out and suppress the chaotic era. Those who can give up time are all heroes of the chaos without exception!""The three of you are only after freedom, fairness, and peace ..."Tian Fang slowly said,"and all of this needs to be cleansed. Chaos will become order, and disorder will become order. That's all! It nurtured the spirit, had spiritual feet, and was not afraid of chaos and destruction! Open your mind, have enough wisdom, and not fear being lost in the crowd!""Unify. The camp is right, the direction is right, and there is no fear of internal strife!""Daoism is the gathering of all DAOs. Those who wield the Daoism are virtuous and not afraid of turbulence.""To stabilize chaos, one must be United. All of you come from different worlds and have unified your own worlds. You should understand that One World has two voices. How can the world be unified?""It's more difficult to unify many voices!""Power is not everything. One's will, direction, and goal are the only things that can make one strong!"The Tribulation looked at him silently.As if she had completely understood his thoughts, she frowned and said in a low voice,""So, you mean ... Our existence has become the worms of chaos and the root of turmoil, and you have been purging us from the very beginning?""No, I didn 't,"Tian Fang shook his head."I've already said that I never thought of killing you. I only hope that ... I can naturally complete the orderly transformation of chaos. Over the past million years, everyone has actually been walking towards the end of their lives. After living for more than a million years, or even two million years, such an extremely long time for all of you, I thought that everyone should have come to terms with it. In the end, I overestimated human nature."After so many years, these people still couldn't get over it.Tribulation laughed!"Have you gotten over it? "If you've seen through it, Tian Fang, why don't you die before us? then I'll believe that you've seen through it. You can't even do it yourself, but you're actually letting us do it. Don't you think that's laughable?"Tian Fang shook his head."It's not funny. There are always people who have to sacrifice something. There are always people who have to do it!" "I'm not fighting. I'm not willing to fight, and I don't want to do it. I'm willing to do some things ... Unfortunately, as I said, my strength doesn't allow it. There are too many level 9s. However, in the past million years, everyone has weakened a lot. This is the opportunity to do this!" On the other side, the human King chuckled,'in that case, senior Tian Fang is also a righteous person? So that's how it is ... If that's the case, senior Tian Fang feels that the few of us are the wielders of the blade in the darkness ... It sounds pretty good!"Su Yu chuckled and said,'knife-wielder? We're not worthy! This senior is the saber holder, and we ... Are the saber!"He turned to look at Li Hao in the distance and shouted,""Shi Guang ... Oh, old Mr. Li, do you think that you're fit to be the saber wielder? Or ... That saber!"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Li Hao didn't have time to pay attention to them.At this moment, the three tier 9 experts were all listening to Tian Fang's words. They didn't have the time to care about him and didn't want to care about him. They only stopped him from entering the chaos Dao.Li Hao wasn't in the mood to listen to what Tian Fang had to say.No matter what he said, he would just treat it as a fart.There might be truth in Tian Fang's words, but in Li Hao's opinion, there was no need to take them seriously.Who was a good person in this chaos?Who could represent justice?Even I can't do it, let alone Tian Fang.What blade-wielder? that was just talk. On one hand, Tian Fang's goal was to purge the rank-9 powerhouses. On the other hand ... He might have other goals.The human King had used the traces left behind by the war to cultivate his dark side.In the yin-yang world, the two DAOs coexisted.The two worlds coexisted! Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  At this moment, Li Hao was wondering if the chaos great Dao was the same.Of course, it might not be two sides. Perhaps ... There was another side hidden under the surface?Spirituality ... Could it be considered as another side?Just like in the Silver Moon world, the truth path was divided into virtual path. The truth path was in physics, and the virtual path was in the spirit. Or rather, it was a kind of power and a kind of spirit. Was this what Tian Fang was pursuing?He had used his spirituality to strengthen himself, and his spiritual will to strengthen himself. Was Tian Fang doing that?If he was doing the same ... Then there might be an explanation for the lack of recovery of the chaotic spirit in the past million years.This means ... This guy is very difficult to deal with!Li Hao's head ached. He had only done it recently, but he had already felt the benefits and the terror. If Tian Fang had started doing it a million years ago ...Looking over there, he felt a slight headache. Could he really beat tianfang?All of a sudden, Tian Fang made him lose his confidence!"The appearance of the battle has brought with it time. Could it be ... That it has also enlightened Tian Fang? the spirit of time is the key to this Dao. After all these years, has Tian Fang been gathering spirit?

3819 Chapter 617
Apart from the chaos great Dao, was there a physical great Dao that corresponded to the Dao of illusion or the Dao of spirituality?If there is, where is it?Why had no one discovered it?Even he himself had not sensed the existence of this Dao until now.Li Hao fell into deep thought.In the distance.After Tian Fang finished explaining some of his thoughts, he looked at Su Yu and the others.""No matter what, it's indeed too late to tribulation these people. Now, it's probably impossible for them to give up on the grade-9 Dao and rebuild the great Dao ... Since they've already developed to this stage, and they still have so many grade-9 cultivators, why don't we ... Destroy them first? maybe we can have a discussion again!""From the beginning to the end, I've actually been observing you. I didn't hurt you." He revealed a smile.The human King sneered,'a bigger huntian? Do you think we're the ninefold guards? If that's all you've got ... Tian Fang, you don't seem to be that great!"Tian Fang laughed again."No matter what, it's a fact that the side facing the calamity is stronger. Human King, you don't have to consider whether what I said is true or false. Should the weak join forces, or should you join forces with him to kill me? you should know what is the best choice!"The human King remained silent.Out of the three sides, Tian Fang was the weaker one, while the calamity side had so many grade-9 experts, so they were stronger.However ... The threat that Tian Fang gave him was even greater!In fact, he wanted to join forces with the Tribulation and kill Tian Fang!However, at this moment, Tian Fang dared to say these things because he might have some backup plans. Also, did these grade-9 experts really ... Listen to tribulations?Tian Fang had been planning for so many years. Did he not have any trump cards?He had a headache!For the past thousand years, he was too lazy to think about these things. At this moment, he looked at the Supreme martial artist. The Supreme martial artist had been recuperating all this time. When he saw Fang ping looking at him, he shook his head slightly, indicating that there was no need to rush. The current situation seemed to be clear, but it was not clear at all."Li Hao!""You brat, you're full of ideas. How do you think we should go now?" the human King shouted.Li Hao's laughter echoed."I don't know. I only represent myself. I can't represent anyone!""Bullshit!"The human King cursed,"whether it's neo martial arts or myriad world, they've all been dragged into this by you. Without you, there wouldn't be so many things. Without you, Su Yu would still be sleeping in myriad world. You've called them over, and you're not going to care?"Li Hao glanced at the great Dao of chaos again and sensed the chaotic energy around him.He suddenly said,"senior Tian Fang, since it's justice ... We are also people of justice. We naturally have to join forces with justice to expel evil. To calamity this person, it sounds like an evil person ..."The Lord of calamity's expression was ugly!Li Hao!He had a grudge against Li Hao, but at this point, he didn't expect that Li Hao was only concerned about personal grudges. This man was unbelievably narrow-minded.Tian fangming had many trump cards!At this moment, if they killed Tian Fang, the two sides would still have a chance to fight each other. However, if they joined forces with Tian Fang, no matter which side was destroyed, they might be swallowed by Tian Fang in the end! Li Hao, do you really not understand the situation?Or ... Do you think you can restrain Tian Fang?"Li Hao!"Calamity's voice was cold,"I can already see the time when you're in trouble!" "I didn't expect you to make such a choice. Tian Fang and I have already revealed everything. Your selfishness has affected more than just you!"Li Hao sighed.I know! Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  However, I also know that if you don't die, you might bring me some trouble.Besides, if you don't die, how can we perfect more plans?He did not say anything else.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly grunted. Heaven and earth shook, and chaos spread out. Countless bloody figures appeared and gathered toward Li Hao in the blink of an eye.He was originally short.In an instant, flesh and blood gathered from all directions. In just an instant, Li Hao completed his reorganization. The three experts, who had been staring at him, suddenly paled!Without a word, he turned and ran!When Li Hao made a move, the first thing they felt was danger!At this moment, who cared if he entered the chaos great Dao!The flesh and blood entered Li Hao's body, and in an instant, his blood flowed like a river, as if thousands of DAOs were reforming and countless worlds were converging! At this moment, Li Hao's qi and blood instantly burst out to the extreme!The powerful qi and blood seemed to have dyed the chaos red!Of the three experts, the hurricane path master turned into a gust of wind and left, the dark path master hid in the darkness and quickly escaped, and the decay path master also corroded the heaven and earth as if he wanted to corrode a hole in the chaos and escape!Although they knew that Li Hao was not a rank-9, Fang ping and Su Yu had killed a rank-9 one after another. Previously, they did not run because Li Hao's strength was limited. Now that they saw the situation, they had no choice but to run!At this moment, Li Hao's aura reached its peak, and an extremely powerful spirituality appeared!It was as if he had instantly transformed into a spirit of chaos. His great Dao trembled violently, and his chaos great Dao trembled violently.Li Hao silently sensed it and sighed with emotion ... As expected, the power of spirituality was terrifyingly strong.Tian Fang...Are you doing such a thing?Or ... Was there more to it?He didn't want to think about this anymore. At this moment, he seemed to have used all his trump cards just to kill these people.Everything would come to an end today.Tian Fang...I hope you won't let me down.A sword appeared out of thin air, as if it was formed from the convergence of thousands of spirits. The sword slashed out with a force that seemed to split the heavens and earth. However, it was not aimed at the three of them but at the chaos great Dao!
