At this moment, they only had one task, which was to stabilize the array and wait for the Thunderbolts to gather. The power of the Crimson Moon in Zheng Hongyuan's body was rich, and now that the great path universe was unable to eliminate this power, the Thunderbolts would only increase.This might be the key to determining the outcome of the battle!The Redwood, the Imperial Guards, and the other monster plants knew very well that if they succeeded ... Even if they did not directly participate in the battle, they would also be great contributors.However, once the formation was broken, the accumulated power of lightning would not be able to kill or severely injure Zheng Hongyuan ... They would be the sinners of this battle."Defend!"The Redwood transmitted its voice to the monster plants,""We have to withstand the pressure and accumulate more power of lightning. Once we kill this fellow, we monster plant clan will have made a great contribution in this battle. When the world reopens, we monster plant clan ... Can also produce a venerable sovereign!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  A Fey plant was feeling uneasy."My Lord, I'm afraid that ... The accumulation isn't enough. The ... The sages won't be able to withstand it!"Hong shanmu was shocked and quickly looked towards the center. He just happened to see the other party crack open a tortoiseshell with a whip. He was instantly shocked!That was a top-tier divine weapon, and its weapon soul was that of a Saint.However, at this moment, his body had been cracked by the other party's whip. If this continued, Li Hao and the others would be finished before they could accumulate enough lightning!Was he that strong?……At this moment, Li Hao also frowned.He was too strong!They couldn't continue like this. The power of the lightning wasn't enough, but if this continued, they would all suffer.His expression changed.He took a deep breath. Suddenly, divine runes appeared in all directions, including the five elements divine runes. He couldn't care about anything else. As for Liu Yan and the others, he didn't care if they would be killed because of the sudden disappearance of the divine runes.It shouldn't ...As he thought about it, divine runes appeared in the next moment.Even the divine text of the word "Dao" that had disappeared reappeared at this moment. The five elements, the Dao text, the wind, Thunder, light, and darkness all appeared.Li Hao's aura instantly increased.This was not enough!At that moment, fragments suddenly appeared between heaven and earth. They began to gather and pile up with the divine text. In the blink of an eye, they turned into a long sword."The starry sky sword?"Zheng Hongyuan was also stunned. The shattered starry sky sword?At this moment, the starry sky sword rapidly healed.All kinds of energy and Sacred Arts were brewing in it.One aperture after another appeared in Li Hao's body.In an instant, 360 apertures appeared, forming a small sword. The next moment, more apertures were lit up, but this time, only 150 were lit up. There was still a long way to go before the 360 apertures in the second round.After moving the city for ten days, Li Hao had gained a lot of insight. However, it was not enough for him to start the second round of kendo techniques.After Zheng Hongyuan sent li Fuhai flying with a punch, Li Hao gritted his teeth and suddenly swallowed the sword. The next moment, his acupuncture points were rapidly ignited. 200,240,260 ...However, there was still a long way to go before he could reach 360.Not enough!He was unable to light up the second round of sword Dao Divine Art. Even if he had opened 359 apertures, it was still not enough. There was no transformation. Zheng Hongyuan's eyes were bright. What a Divine Art!He could tell!If Li Hao were to ignite another 360 apertures in the second round, he would at least be much stronger than he was now, and wouldn't be defeated instantly.Good divine power, good Daoist technique!Unfortunately ... The other party's Foundation wasn't strong enough. Even if he forcibly devoured the starry sky sword, it wouldn't be enough to ignite the second round.What a pity!He felt sorry for Li Hao and smiled even more.""It seems...Not enough!"Li Hao looked at him coldly. The next moment, he suddenly laughed."Maybe ... It's enough?"Zheng Hongyuan was startled. At this moment, an extremely dense blood aura suddenly erupted from Li Hao's body. The blood aura instantly penetrated his acupuncture points, and a shadow vaguely appeared on his body.One of them had a blood-red saber at his waist and a longbow on his back."Blood Emperor ..."The few of them were shocked!At this moment, the word "battling the heavens" appeared. In an instant, out of the remaining 360 apertures in the second round, there were still 70 to 80 apertures that had not been opened. In the blink of an eye, these two words quickly ignited them.Zhan Tian!In the distance, even heaven battling city trembled slightly.On the periphery, the blood Qi of some of the awakened heaven-battling Army soldiers instantly disappeared and merged with Li Hao's body. Li Hao roared, and with a furious roar, BOOM!The second round of acupuncture points were all ignited!"Die!" The word 'heaven battling' helped him complete this forced ignition of his aperture acupoints. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to complete it.The long sword pierced through heaven and earth!The sword of the great Dao!With a single sword strike, wind, fire, Thunder, and lightning all charged towards the other party. At this moment, the others were all overjoyed.He actually succeeded!"Kill!"The powerhouses roared in anger.Li Hao, who had been greatly suppressed, became the main force. His strength instantly surpassed li Fuhai 's, and even though Zheng Hongyuan had dodged, he was still injured by the sword Qi!"Amazing!"Zheng Hongyuan snorted and lashed out with his whip. Hong long, the sword Qi was shattered, but in an instant, more sword Qi was formed.The few people who were originally in danger finally heaved a sigh of relief.However, Li Hao also knew that even a second-round Kendo technique was no match for a Heavenly King.He was still far from it!It could only be said that they had barely managed to block the opponent's invincible attacks. If they continued to be attacked like that, they would all be finished.Zheng Hongyuan also shouted and whipped him again and again!

2121 Chapter 357
Bang Bang Bang!Several experts were continuously sent flying. The old turtle's shell was already covered in cracks, and general Huai was about to become a bald tree. As for li Fuhai, his Golden Horn was broken, and his body was covered in injuries.The ninth Division commander was the weakest. At this moment, his body, which had just recovered, was pierced by the whip and almost half of his body was broken.This person was too strong!A fierce battle, a bitter battle!The few of them struggled to hold on. Li Hao's attacks were extremely destructive, but he could not escape the danger of being seriously injured. He was hit by the other party time and time again, and his body was torn and bloody. On the other hand, the other party only had a few bloody marks and a slight decline in his breathing. He was not seriously injured.Zheng Hongyuan laughed.Not bad!It's a pity that you've met me. If you were a new Heavenly King, you might really suffer, but I'm not.At this moment, as they fought, the formation outside was also shaking violently.At this moment, the bodies of the dozens of monster plants were bent.But Li Hao didn't give the order, so they were still holding on.He could only hold on!At this moment, the battle was still going on inside. On the outside, the orange armor suddenly emitted a weak ripple."Family head Zheng ... I'll break the formation later. Family head, use the formation first. Heaven battling city hasn't been activated yet. Li Hao is preparing to give family head a thunderous blow. Leave the formation first, or else ... You'll be easily injured by heaven battling city!"Zheng Hongyuan's heart fluttered. In fact, he didn't really trust this guy.He felt that ... It was not very appropriate.However ... If the other party were to take the initiative to break the formation, it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't affect the overall situation. It would be better if the formation was broken, but if it wasn't ... It wouldn't matter.These monster plants did not give him too much pressure.Of course, heaven battling city did not appear.If heaven battling city really appeared and exploded, the power of the main city would not be weak.If Wu Peng really broke the formation, it would be good for him to walk out on his own.As he was thinking, suddenly, the orange armor moved. Suddenly, it punched a monster plant. With a bang, the monster plant trembled violently and its aura instantly withered."Wu Peng!"At this moment, Li Hao roared madly, extremely furious!This was also a signal.As for whether the other party believed it or not ... Li Hao didn't have much hope. If he believed it, the power of lightning could definitely land on the other party. If he didn't believe it, it wouldn't make much of a difference.Of course, he would try his best to be stronger.At this moment,"Wu Peng" had defeated a monster plant with a punch and shouted,""Break!"Boom! Boom! Boom!The formation started to crumble and the fey plants spat out golden blood. The Redwood appeared and they were extremely shocked."You ... You deserve to die ..."Zheng Hongyuan was stunned for a moment. Then, he laughed hysterically.He had really broken the formation! It didn't seem fake that the formation was about to be broken. He didn't expect that there would be an unexpected surprise.It was naturally for the best if they could walk out of the formation.He disappeared in an instant and reappeared near Wu Peng. He took a step and was about to walk out of the formation. It was safer to walk out.On the opposite side, Wu Peng sent a monster plant flying with a punch.The next moment, a huge hole appeared in the formation. The other monster plants vomited blood one after another. They were really vomiting blood, and even their power of origin was vomited out.It wasn't caused by Wu Peng, but ... The lightning was too strong, and they couldn't hold on any longer, crushing the formation.Zheng Hongyuan took a step forward and was about to laugh when his expression suddenly changed.At this moment, a few people rushed over from behind. In the sky, an extremely thick bolt of lightning as big as a heavenly pillar suddenly descended with a loud rumble!In the great Dao universe, although there were new great DAOs, the power of the Crimson Moon had provoked them for a long time but had not destroyed them. The great Dao universe was furious!He had to kill this person!BOOM!A huge Thunderbolt descended in an instant. Zheng Hongyuan's expression changed. He thought it was a formation and wanted to avoid it. However, he realized that no matter where he appeared, the Thunderbolt would lock onto him.Boom! Boom! Boom!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the heavens and earth. Zheng Hongyuan screamed in pain. In an instant, countless cracks appeared on his body. He was in disbelief. What was this?It wasn't a formation!It seemed like ... A Great Tribulation of a venerable sovereign.Zheng Hongyuan was furious. He looked at Wu Peng in the distance ... But at this moment, Wu Peng was no longer there. The armor instantly appeared on a person's body. It was Li Hao. In fact, Li Hao had only been testing the waters.It didn't matter whether he succeeded or not. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  It could only be said that Zheng Hongyuan was currently enduring more and more direct lightning power."Kill him!" He shouted coldly.After saying that, he rushed into the sky and didn't make a move.The other four quickly charged toward Zheng Hongyuan.Where's Li Hao?He went to absorb the power of the great Dao. Such a thick lightning was simply unbelievable. He had to absorb the power of the great Dao first and open his meridians like crazy to strengthen himself. Only then would he have a greater chance of killing his opponent.He instantly fell into the lightning, and after the lightning madly attacked Zheng Hongyuan, what was left behind were all kinds of great Dao power.This was the first time that Li Hao had come into contact with such a large amount of great DAOs.He was absorbing madly!One by one, he opened his apertures crazily. The apertures that he had forcefully opened earlier were instantly stabilized.,m At this moment, Li Hao didn't even care about attribute-less Dao meridians. He opened them as soon as he saw them. One, two ... He quickly opened one Dao Meridian after another.Below him, Zheng Hongyuan let out a blood-curdling screech as he frantically resisted the lightning. The power of the Crimson Moon in his body was also being worn down bit by bit. When the power of the Crimson Moon dissipated, the lightning would also disappear.At this moment, he had no time to care about anything else. The others were also attacking madly.

2122 Chapter 357
He left many bloody wounds on his body, but he still couldn't kill a Heavenly King. He was so powerful that a few Saints even suspected that he had entered the late Heavenly King realm. This was too difficult!BOOM!The sound of explosions reverberated through the world.Zheng Hongyuan kept screaming, but he was still resisting. He cursed,""You can't kill me! You're dreaming if you think you can kill me with mere lightning!"At this moment, his body was extremely charred, but he was rapidly regenerating.The wounds left by the Saints were also healing.In the sky, Li Hao didn't say a word and continued to open his meridians. The power of great DAOs mixed with the lightning was too much.Three, five ...Li Hao didn't care about anything else. Even if he felt that he couldn't bear it anymore, he continued to open his meridians. In the end, he couldn't even count how many there were. At this moment, the lightning was much weaker.Zheng Hongyuan, on the other hand, was still alive. He had sent the ninth Division commander flying with a whip and laughed."Do you think you're worthy of killing a Heavenly King?"The few of them were in despair!He couldn't even be killed?The ninth Division commander roared, and his aura exploded. It was a sign of self-destruction, and he was furious.With the five Saints working together, including the five desolate beasts and 10 Saints from before, in addition to the lightning of the great Dao, they were even comparable to a Heavenly King. One Heavenly King and 10 Saints, yet this guy still didn't die after such a long battle ... I'll blow you up! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Just as he was about to self-detonate, the world suddenly shook violently!All the cover around him instantly vanished.A long river appeared.It was a ring-shaped River of Stars. At this moment, a long sword appeared with countless stars merging into it. In the sky, Li Hao had absorbed too much power of the great DAOs. He couldn't hold on any longer.A huge long sword appeared in the universe."Life extermination!" Li Hao roared.The sword intent of longevity swordsman!At this moment, Zheng Hongyuan's expression changed drastically, as if he had thought of something, as if he had seen something. It was as if he had returned to the era when the sword Saint was in charge of the Silver Moon."No..."With a shrill cry, he turned around and fled.At this moment, he didn't seem to be seriously injured, but in reality, he had consumed a lot of energy. His physical body had been shattered by the lightning. This sword was stronger than any of the previous ones.Li Hao's body was cracking, but he had to grit his teeth.Escape?Where to?"Heaven battling city, lock onto him!"In an instant, heaven battling city appeared and suppressed the world. The word "Zhan Tian" fell from Li Hao's body like a heavy burden. With a boom, the Zhan Tian Army locked down the surrounding void. Zheng Hongyuan's expression changed drastically, and he roared,""If you kill me, my son will no longer have any fear and will definitely kill you! My son has hope of becoming an Emperor. Li Hao, don't you dare!"He was talking about Zheng Yu.Li Hao shouted coldly and slashed out with his sword.Your son became an Emperor?F * ck!I'll kill him before he becomes a Saint Emperor!At this moment, everything in his body was fused into this sword.The sword pierced through the void!The power of 10000 DAOs erupted!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the heavens and earth. Zheng Hongyuan, who was suppressed on the spot, let out a furious roar and continuously swung his fists to block. Sword Qi rampaged and destroyed his body. However, in the blink of an eye, his arm disappeared, his physical body was shattered, and his strength was continuously worn out.His body recovered, then shattered again, recovered again, and shattered again ... This fellow was more than 10 times harder to kill than a Saint!BOOM!In the end, there was a loud sound as the sword swept across the sky. The area where Zheng Hongyuan had been standing suddenly fell silent.The sword light dissipated!Heaven and earth fell silent.The five Saints, dozens of undying, and tens of thousands of soldiers were all paralyzed in the void. They were all extremely shocked.Li Hao's expression changed drastically. He roared,""Kill!"A weak sword light instantly burst out.A shadow appeared in the air. Zheng Hongyuan was surprised that he knew ...Li Hao cursed in his heart!"You've never died. Which neo martial artist who died didn't fight one last time, self-destruct, or scream and curse? you have nothing except for saying that your son killed me ... You're definitely not dead!艹!This person was really hard to kill!Zheng Hongyuan gathered his mind power. Although he was not dead, he was extremely weak. The others were the same.He quickly condensed it and revealed a cold smile.It's too difficult to kill me!Just as Li Hao and the others unleashed their spiritual power again to kill him, the void suddenly trembled, and a huge star appeared in the depths of the universe. In an instant, the huge star flew out, and a book seemed to appear in the illusion.The huge star turned into a book and suppressed the heavens and earth. Zheng Hongyuan was shocked and roared,""That's impossible ..."BOOM!The great star exploded, and Zheng Hongyuan's spiritual body instantly shattered. The next moment, Li Hao and the others charged over. With a boom, the world trembled, and Zheng Hongyuan's miserable cries resounded through the universe!The broken planet disappeared in a flash.Li Hao's expression changed slightly. He looked at Da Xing in suspicion.The others were also confused.'What ... What is this?'BOOM!With an explosion, countless origin power, Heavenly King Power, immortal power, and boundless spiritual power spread across the entire universe. A Heavenly King was finally worn down to death by Li Hao's group!……At the same time.Outside of Hurricane city, Zhang an looked up at the sky and spat out a mouthful of blood, which instantly turned into ashes. He shook his head and didn't care anymore.Meanwhile, in Hurricane city, Hong Chen's expression suddenly changed as he mumbled,""That's impossible!"How could that be possible?Li Hao's side definitely didn't have the power to kill a Heavenly King. Even if they did, they could kill someone who had just entered the Heavenly King realm. If his guess was correct, it was his father, who was in the mid-stage or even the late-stage of the Heavenly King realm.He couldn't be killed by these people!No, this was definitely wrong. Perhaps ... He had guessed wrong?But ... Why did he feel like they were connected by blood?It was impossible!His expression changed, and for the first time, he felt a sense of fear. How could this be?At this moment, heaven and earth shook as if they were cheering for something. Heaven's will swept out and the power of the great Dao suddenly overflowed in all directions.At this moment, the entire Silver Moon seemed to be shaking.A Heavenly King was dead!

Chapter 2123 Advancing To The Dao Integration Stage (1)
Bright star sector.Heaven and earth shook, and even the universe was trembling slightly.The death of a Heavenly King was a form of nourishment for the new Dao universe. It was a form of perfection for the great Dao, and even the great Dao was analyzing this Heavenly King.At this moment, Li Hao and the others were all laughing.Although everyone was injured, and Li Hao's body was still exploding because he couldn't withstand the strong explosive force, he was still smiling.In this battle, he had to deal with many enemies, and they were all very strong.However, it wasn't as dangerous as the battle at boundless city.That was because Li Hao had been planning this battle from beginning to end. Everything was on his side. He had the support of many people. No matter how strong the other party was, they had still worn him down in the end!There was actually danger ... But it wasn't that desperate.Li Hao's eyes revealed a smile.He looked at the scattered stars.Teacher, did you see that?"Previously, we killed a few Saints and were almost completely annihilated. Now, we have killed a Heavenly King. Although we have the help of the neo martial artists ... These neo martial artists will soon become Silvermoon people.The neo martial artists were no longer the main combat force.I'm the leader of this battle!It was different."Previously, we were the ones who went to seek help from others. In this battle, I'm the one who led them to kill the traitors ... I'm their core.Li Hao's smile was brilliant.After killing a Heavenly King, the biggest change at this moment was not in his strength, but in his mentality. His heart had become broader.The Heavenly King was the strongest person under venerable sovereigns.No matter how strong he had been in the past, he was still able to kill him now. Li Hao didn't care about the past, but the present.At this moment, his Shi began to appear.The great Dao had been given away, but the momentum and spirit were still there.At this moment, Shi seemed to have become stronger.There seemed to be some changes in his body.Li Hao couldn't tell exactly how it had changed, but he had a vague feeling that he was about to reach the next level.The nine stages of the sun Moon realm, he had already reached a peak.He seemed to be about to step into the next level.Dao integration!Yes, the daomerge. He could sense that the 36 Dao meridians he had opened were merging into a small sword. When this small sword was completed, he might officially step into the Dao integration level.He had officially entered the battle prowess of a Sage.The late stage of Sun Moon realm was between the peak of immortal realm and the Saint realm.Li Hao was able to kill Saints because he had many techniques, opened many meridians, and grasped many DAOs. In reality, director Zhao, who was at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier, could not match a Saint. He could only barely resist a bit.After slashing ten, breaking hundred, fighting thousand, mountain sea, Sun Moon, Li Hao was about to reach the next stage, the official Dao integration!What was the daomerge?Daomerge. The great DAOs as one. With the attribute-less Dao Meridian as the foundation and the 36 most basic Dao meridians as the foundation, after completing a cycle, all the Dao meridians would be activated and merged into one, forming the embryonic form of the attribute-less divine power. This was Dao integration.Li Hao thought to himself.360 attribute-less Dao meridians could form a complete sword Dao super power. At this stage, in this era, he could probably rival a pseudo-Emperor."If I succeed in fusing them in one cycle, I'll officially reach the daomerge level? If there are nine stages to the Dao integration, then 37 72 Dao meridians might only be the second stage while 73 108 Dao meridians are the third stage. They correspond to the three levels of the sage. "" 109 Dao meridians and reaching the fourth level of Dao integration. That's comparable to the Heavenly King level ..."" 217 Dao meridians and a seventh-level Dao integration cultivator. That's comparable to a half-step sovereign. Is that true?"Li Hao didn't plan to break it down into too many levels. Realm didn't matter, as long as his combat strength had reached a certain level. Only when he had 360 meridians would he undergo a huge transformation.Therefore, this stage should be the Dao integration stage.Every level should merge with a Dao Meridian cycle.In that case, the seventh level of Dao integration should be comparable to a half-step sovereign. At the ninth level, he might still be on the same level, but he would never be able to surpass the venerable sovereign level, because the venerable sovereign level was a huge transformation.At this moment, Li Hao vaguely understood.Venerable sovereigns were terrifyingly powerful. One would need at least 360 Dao meridians to completely merge and form a sword Dao divine power. Only then would one have the hope of fighting against a venerable sovereign.On the other hand, Zheng Hongyuan, who had just been killed, was at least at the fourth or fifth level of Dao integration.On the other hand, although Li Hao was only at the ninth level of the sun Moon realm, his combat strength at his peak was probably close to the third level of the Dao integration realm. This was because he had forcibly activated too many Dao meridians and had the help of the great Dao universe. In fact, Li Hao's combat strength had already far surpassed his realm.However, the enemies he had encountered had always been very powerful, and everyone had overlooked this point.As for the other sages, they were all between the first and third stage of the Dao integration realm. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao looked at the few Saints lying in the void. Li Fuhai was actually the strongest among them, at around the second or third level of Dao integration. As for the others, the ninth master was only at the first level of Dao integration.As for the old turtle and general Huai, they were both at the second level of Dao integration."Dao integration stage!"At this moment, Li Hao officially decided on the name of this realm. The entire Dao integration realm included the Saints, Heavenly Kings, and half-emperors of the past. Li Hao didn't bother to further classify them.Perhaps, after countless years, when the human race's progress was slow, the division of realms was actually to give everyone more motivation.Otherwise, a Dao integration stage super mighty figure who had cultivated for countless years without making any progress would be driven mad.

Chapter 2124 Advancing To The Dao Integration Stage (2)
In fact, this was the case for new martial.Be it Saints, Heavenly Kings, or even venerable sovereigns, they were all marked by the level of shattered space. In fact, it didn't matter if they were transformed into a realm.Li Hao thought to himself and no longer cared about this.He only knew that he was about to officially enter the Dao integration stage.The 36 Dao meridians had started to merge officially after this battle. Once it was completed, he would have a basic sword Dao divine power. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Perhaps, there would be a slight transformation.The reason why it was weak was because it was only a small cycle and not a complete big cycle."Wan Sheng!"At that moment, the soldiers and monster plants around them all cheered.He won!He had killed a Heavenly King!At this moment, they were all looking at Li Hao with madness and fervour. Even at the peak of the heaven-battling Army, they had never killed a Heavenly King.At the peak of the heaven-battling Army, the commander was only at the peak of the Saint plane, not a Heavenly King.Heaven battling city's city Lord and the Wang family's master had only barely stepped into the Heavenly King realm.Even the outside world didn't know. They only knew that there was only one venerable sovereign in the Silver Moon world. There were also some peak-stage Saints. There was actually a gap between Heavenly Kings because most Heavenly Kings were looking for a breakthrough to enter the venerable sovereign level or to prepare for the venerable sovereign calamity!And today, they had killed a Heavenly King. A Heavenly King without the great path of origins was still a Heavenly King.The other party did not have a great Dao of origin, nor did Li Hao and the others ... Although Li Hao did not cultivate a great Dao of origin, the soldiers did not care about that.It was extremely fanatical!Everyone was extremely excited.Killing this Heavenly King meant that Li Hao's side had advanced to the next level. From now on, all the main cities, with the exception of the red dust world's side, would no longer be a match for Li Hao!The world had officially entered the three stages.Red dust, Red Moon, and Li Hao were on each side.From the chaos at the beginning, with hundreds of clans fighting for power, countless experts, ancient cities, and ruins ... Now, Silver Moon had completely divided the world into three parts, and both the venerable sovereign and Hong Chen were greatly restricted.Li Hao's side, which was the weakest, welcomed a new development.Li Hao smiled and said,""Everyone, heal your injuries first and clean up the battlefield. I want to cultivate for a while!"With that, he entered the void and disappeared.In the distance, a long river surrounded the world. Li Hao entered it and disappeared.Li Fuhai and the others looked at each other, and their eyes flickered. Li Hao ... Might advance.He had fought against powerhouses, killed Saints, and even a Heavenly King ... His opponent's essence, energy, and spirit had already reached a peak. Li Hao, who was at the ninth level of the sun Moon realm, was probably about to officially step into the next level.The few of them did not say anything. At this moment, they had barely recovered for a while and began to clean up the battlefield.The death of a Heavenly King had left behind too much wealth.Not to mention the other party's treasures, just his flesh, blood, bones, and energy were all treasures.Under normal circumstances, the human race would rarely harvest the other party's flesh and blood. However, in this era where the world was cut off and the other party was a traitor, the only Heavenly King they had killed, who would care about such things?"Zheng Hongyuan is dead ... Zheng Gong is also dead ... The Zheng family and we are at war!"The old turtle suddenly sighed.Of the four Zheng family's father and son, the eldest had gone out. Either he did not join the three, or ... He might have been killed by the venerable sword when he went out. Of the three people left in the Silver Moon world, only Zheng Yu was still alive.The third son of the Zheng family was probably Hong Chen.The other party was also a Heavenly King.In fact, he was even more powerful than his father. This was still very terrifying. In an era where origin source was severed, Zheng Yu was able to advance all the way from an undying to a Heavenly King and even a half-step sovereign ... One could only imagine how extraordinary Zheng Yu's talent was.At the side, li Fuhai touched the broken horn and felt heartache. When he heard this, he sneered,""So what? You're afraid of Zheng Yu? Zheng Hongyuan said that his son has the bearing of a great sovereign ... If he really has the confidence to overcome the venerable sovereign's tribulation, why would he plan so much?""If it was truly unparalleled world, it could have advanced to venerable sovereign in the new martial era and fought in the Crimson Moon world. Perhaps it could have gone one step further and entered a deeper level of venerable sovereign ... But the other party is sneaky and obviously doesn't have the confidence ... Then there's nothing to be afraid of." It was not afraid anyway!In the post-neo martial era, what was there to be afraid of when one was afraid of the venerable sovereign's great Tribulation and did not dare to cross it?The human King did not set up the venerable sovereign's great calamity to kill the hope of neo martial.On the contrary, the human King was also an Emperor with a pattern.As long as one's temperament, strength, and ability were up to standard and one had passed the Tribulation, he would even allow one to leave with all their energy and combat strength. If one had the ability, one could even enter other universes and be as free as the sun god. One would not be bound by anyone, not even the human King.If he didn't have the ability ... Then he would obediently stay in the neo martial world and be protected by the human King.The old turtle sighed with emotion."That's what he said. But if it's as Zheng Hongyuan said, then Zheng Yu might have really stepped into the half-step sovereign realm. Let's not talk about his temperament. No matter how weak he is, he's not someone we can deal with."This was a fact!Li Fuhai nodded. Without the origin, their progress was actually very slow.At this moment, li Fuhai suddenly looked at the starry world and said,""The Dao of essence ... Has no future! It's not that the origin Dao is bad, but we can't extract the origin for cultivation now. Do you expect us to kill Saints and Heavenly Kings for cultivation? Killing a Heavenly King isn't even enough for us to advance once ... On the other hand, this new great Dao and new universe are growing stronger ..."

Chapter 2125 Advancing To The Dao Integration Stage (3)
As soon as these words came out, the hearts of the few people moved."Our daoless Meridian ..." The old turtle said softly.Could he be learning from old Wang?Directly change to a physical body? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Tsk!"Li Fuhai was a little speechless."You're really simple-minded! We don't have a Dao Meridian ... But that's not important. ""What?" "The Dao Meridian is just a connection point. We have the great Dao of origin, which doesn't conflict with the new Dao. As long as it connects the universe and has a fixed passage, the Dao of the great star can be created at will and stuffed into the Galaxy ... You can have whatever Dao you want!"He didn't really care. As a descendant of venerable sovereigns, he had two venerable sovereigns in one family. He wasn't like the young people from Yuanping martial arts university. He was the sea Guardian. There were so many demons. It wasn't ordinary for him to be able to get the position of Silver Moon Sea Guardian.Li Fuhai was very knowledgeable and had come into contact with many people. At this moment, he said,""For example, for the fire element, you can use the origin to call a bed, run through the fire area, and create a fire planet. Now that the universe is new, the rejection is not strong. As long as it can be operated for a period of time, it will be called the fire element called a bed!""When the great Dao universe becomes powerful, there won't be any more opportunities. Because at that time, the universe will be powerful and will reject foreign objects ..."He continued,"for example, when a turtle is young and weak, you put a ball on its butt. It will think that it was born like this ... But when it grows up, you put a ball on its butt again. Will it bite you to death?"“……”The old turtle didn't want to pay attention to it.Why?I didn't provoke you, and you as an example ... You are nothing!It was very old, but this person was not bad either. He had two venerable sovereigns, or even three venerable sovereigns ... It could not afford to offend him. How could the soul of a divine weapon compare to this fellow?Therefore, he could only silently agree.Li Fuhai looked at the few of them and said,"right now, we are still Saints. Our combat strength is not weak. We are not weak at all. We can still forcefully enter the universe!" After a while, when the great Dao becomes stronger and we can't force our way in ... Then we can only reforge our physical bodies and become a new generation of humans. We'll have to start from zero. Although it'll be faster than others, we'll have to cultivate to the next level of the sun and moon if we want to recover the battle power of Saints ... How much time do you think it'll take?"The few of them fell into contemplation.Li Fuhai laughed and didn't care. He muttered,""A bunch of ignorant young people. No wonder they could only be pathetically insignificant in the land of Silver Moon ..."The few of them were speechless. The ninth Division commander was not afraid. He frowned and said in a low voice,""Senior ... Is also in Silver Moon!"Li Fuhai laughed,"it's different!" Of course, I didn't mention your Li family. "I came to Silver Moon for a different purpose. I didn't come here to be exiled, nor did I come here because I had no other way out. I came here because there are many opportunities in the New World. I want to become the king of the demon race here! I'll complement revered sword and make him the master of the world. I'll just get the king of the monster race or a fake emperor ... Unfortunately, revered sword didn't devour the world. I didn't get anything either. It's a great loss. "It was very regretful and said helplessly,"what do you know? in order to get this position, two venerable sovereigns of the water deity Race personally came forward to plead with the human King, Emperor Cang, Supreme venerable, Emperor Nan and many other experts. We even gave a large amount of resources to venerable sword...Otherwise, venerable sword...Would have starved to death! In the end, I didn't get anything. It's really ... A huge loss!""Fortunately, there's still a chance!"At this moment, the ninth Division commander was stunned. You spent money?How come I didn't know?Of course, this was a deal between venerable sovereigns, so it was normal for him to not know.He didn't expect this!The other party was unwilling to come to this bitterly cold place, but the water stream clan actually went to the human King, Emperor Cang, and Zhi Zun to plead for them just to send someone here. This ... Was really not ordinary.Venerable the sword had to give him some face.Li Fuhai was very arrogant, and he had the right to be arrogant with these people. Seeing that they were silent, he said,""The opportunity is right in front of you. If you don't grasp it and hesitate, how can you succeed? A group of ignorant guys. Whether it was the great Dao of origins, the great Dao of inner world, new Dao, old Dao, new martial arts, or beginner martial arts ... In fact, what did it matter? Even if you've cultivated the Crimson Moon Dao, at the critical moment, if you strike back at the Crimson Moon, the human King will still praise you for doing a good job!""In the new martial era, there are still beginner level experts, origin level experts, and even the sword Master. He doesn't cultivate any Dao and is one with it. Isn't it the same?""The Li family's Dao is still considered the great Dao of origins ..." The ninth Division commander raised his eyebrows."Bullshit!"Li Fuhai was not polite at all. He did not show any respect to this junior and did not need to. He immediately scolded,""Why the hell is the origin of venerable sword? Long ago, he had swallowed the Dao into his stomach, the three gates and the bridge into my stomach, and the longevity sword was the only thing in the world! Perhaps it's a new Dao universe or a self-made universe ... The reason why venerable Swordmaster has been unwilling to devour the Silver Moon is probably because he feels that there's no need for it. He might be nurturing the Dao of the universe on his own, do you understand?"The ninth Division commander was stunned, and so were the others.What?The cosmos?How was that possible?Li Fuhai couldn't be bothered to say anything more. He turned his head to look at the monster plants that were lying on the ground and suddenly said,""That ... That little mahogany, do you have any thoughts about it?"As soon as he said that, Hong Mu instantly replied,""We will obey Lord Marquis's orders!"

2126 Chapter 358
Go to hell!He's better at shooting than me.He had a bright future!Li Fuhai was too lazy to say anything else. He closed his eyes and pondered. Soon, he began to heal his injuries. He thought that he had to change paths as soon as possible. While there were few people, he could think about which area he should occupy.Its eyes were sharp!There weren't many great DAOs in the great Dao River, and they weren't perfect yet. He had to choose a region and become the boss.The five elements area ... It actually wanted the water element, but it knew that the water element had probably been taken away by Li Hao's direct descendants. That wouldn't do. If it wanted the water element, it might have to share it with others in the future, and it might not even get a big share.Saber, spear, sword, halberd ... He wasn't good at all.Wind, Thunder, light, darkness ... This wouldn't work either. All of Li Hao's subordinates practiced elemental divine abilities.With all kinds of thoughts flashing through his mind, he looked at the main road and the long river. After a long time, he was struck by an idea. It didn't matter what area Li Hao occupied. A person like Li Hao wouldn't occupy a specific area. He would only coordinate.But now, to the demons ... And to him, he wasn't good at anything else. His cultivation might not go smoothly.But ... What about his physical body?Yes, physical body!It disappeared in an instant and soon reappeared in a small area. There were very few people who cultivated the physical body Dao, only a few direct descendants. In the entire long river, this physical body area was filled with milky-white halos and very few stars.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Moreover, they were all very small.The only star that was slightly larger was Li Hao 's.The others ... Were all very weak.This area was far inferior to the five elements, the divine arts of the other attributes, and even the blade and sword region. However, li Fuhai's eyes flickered and he was somewhat happy. To the demon race, this place was great!The physical body would definitely be the mainstream in the future. Even if not everyone's goal was to strengthen their physical body, it would definitely be something that everyone would care about.If he could occupy the fleshly body region ... He would become the master of this Dao. That would be a stroke of good fortune.It sneaked a glance behind it. At this moment, those fools probably hadn't thought so deeply. Little nine of the Li family, who was from the same clan as Li Hao, had become stupid from practicing the sword. He probably didn't think too much either. Even if he did, he was probably thinking about the way of the sword.Swordsmanship was not weak. It was even very strong, but there were too many swordsmen. Li Hao had many direct subordinates who practiced swordsmanship.Now, there were not many people who had the qualifications to fight with him for the physical body Dao. This place ... Is mine!It didn't care about anything else. It began to collect the power of great DAOs and the overflowing milky-white physical power. It began to create its own star. It hadn't Changed paths yet, so it had to make preparations first.As soon as Li Hao came out of seclusion, he said that he wanted to change lanes. He instantly changed lanes, connected the stars, and moved to a new lane.Opportunities were always given to the prepared Yao.It was busy, and not long after, a person ... Or rather, a demon appeared in an area rich in life energy. Looking at the old bull, Hong Shan transformed into a human and said with some embarrassment,""Your Excellency Sea Guardian, what do you think ... I should choose this living area?"The old bull sighed with emotion. The monster plant clan was truly a talent.As for general Huai, it was a pity that he was not as smart as this guy.What a waste of your ancestors 'loyalty to King Huai!"You want to choose this ... It's a good place. The Dao of life is extremely important in any era. You can think about it yourself. If there's anyone who wants to snatch it from you, can you snatch it from the other party ..." Hong Mu thought for a moment and looked at the Imperial Guards who were still working foolishly in the distance. That guy was too young and a little silly.But ... He was the first ancient expert to support Li Hao.Li Hao might not care if he seized this area, but it was also possible that he would let the other party take root here and share the area with him in the future.However, how could two people sharing be compared to one tree being the strongest?For monster plants, it was either the life Dao or the wood Dao, but ... There were too many people who cultivated the five elements Dao. As for the life Dao, no one seemed to have cultivated it yet.It was a little conflicted and hesitant. It might not necessarily lose to the Emperor guards ... But if it did, it might cause some trouble."Senior ... Can you give me some advice? "The monster plant clan has never had any strong cultivators. We're all monsters. In the future, I hope senior can give us some guidance. The human race has always been the Orthodox lineage of the world. We monsters will not fight for it. However, when the monster race becomes strong, we also have some chances to stand tall in the world ..."Li Fuhai was a little surprised to see that it had such good fortune. It was not easy for a wild monster plant to have such knowledge. This blockhead was right. It was too difficult for a monster plant to produce a monster.It pondered for a moment. For the life-type, there would definitely be a lot of monster plants fighting for more. Even the human race would fight for it because this was a large type."I suggest you change to something that no one really cares about ... But it's still quite suitable for monster plants, such as ... Chaos!""What?"Hong Mu was stunned. What chaos?"Can't you see that the chaos element has been born? But let me tell you, in the universe, there are actually extremely powerful desolate beasts. A desolate beast is like the Lord of a world, taking root in the universe, taking root in the chaos, and being extremely powerful! My grandfather once walked out of the new martial world and went to the universe once. He was fortunate enough to meet a chaos tree that was wandering in the universe! For your monster plant clan, taking root in the chaosverse is simply a good match! The potential of a monster plant is still very great!"

2127 Chapter 358
"Of course, we're betting! If he gambled that he could walk out of the universe, or else ... His future in a small world or a large world would be limited. But if he gambled that he could walk out of the world and enter the universe ... Ha, that would be great. The opportunity had come! You control the chaos and take root in the chaos. By then, even the Tree of Life and the tree of wood would not be as good as the chaos tree!"Hong MU's heart moved.Bet!It was betting that Li Hao would be able to leave the Silver Moon, leave the small world, and even wander around chaos. At that time, it would be able to control chaos, and its opportunity would come ...However, this was a little far away.It took a look at power upturned sea. Life-type and wood-type were actually the most suitable for monster plants. 'Is this person trying to suppress me, or is he really suggesting this?'However, what this person said actually made sense.Now, no one cared about the chaos Faction. In fact, it did not even know that the chaos great Dao had been born. At this time, no one would fight for it, and no one had much contact with it. As for the great desolate King, they did come into contact with a few, but he was not considered a direct descendant.Even if they did surrender and truly began to train in the Dao of primordial chaos, they would only be his vassals.The thought flashed through his mind and he was struggling.In fact, it only wanted to be a boss in a small world ... But since it had chosen the chaos element, it had to hope and hope that Li Hao could go further, to walk out of the world with the great Dao!The life element ... It actually yearned for it.However, when he turned to look at the Emperor guard ... This silly fellow had arrived earlier than him. He didn't stand a good chance.As a smart tree, it knew that sometimes, it was hard to win. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  It was not strength, but friendship.After much thought, it made a decision."Thank you for your guidance, senior. I'll go take a look around the chaos element ...""He has a bright future!"Li Fuhai laughed. Of course, he had to bet that Li Hao would be able to leave the world and defeat venerable sovereigns. Otherwise, the chaos element was inferior to the other elements in this world.It didn't choose because the path of the physical body was already very good. The chaos element was too risky!This was more suitable for the monster plant line, whose strength was slightly inferior but still desired to stand out. If it worked, the monster plant line would eat meat. If they lost, they actually did not lose anything. Moreover, the monster plant line did not only have Hong Mu.Hong Mu didn't say anything else and quickly disappeared. He didn't go to find the chaos element directly. Instead, he went to look for the Emperor guards. He wanted to do them a favor and let them interact more with the life element so that they could switch routes.Although the monster plant did not have a Dao Meridian, it could use the origin Dao to connect to a region. As li Fuhai had said, it was still weak to make love now. When it grew up, it would naturally merge into one.After leading the Imperial Guards to the region of life, the Redwood disappeared and continued its search for the weak chaos element. At present, Li Hao was probably the only person in the world who cultivated the new Dao of chaos.In this long river, it was probably only a small part that was unremarkable. It would be very difficult to find it. Moreover, it seemed to have no future. In this way, no one would fight with him for it.……At this moment, the demons began to move.The ninth Division commander and the others fell into deep thought. After a long time, the old turtle suddenly said,""Previously, a huge star suddenly appeared in the depths of the universe. That should be an expert who cultivated a new Dao. Looking at his strength ... He's also a Sage, and not an ordinary Sage!"At the last moment, the huge star that appeared directly suppressed the other party. It was extremely powerful.He was at least a Saint!The other party was also a new Dao elite.But Li Hao didn't seem to know what this meant.Who would be the one representing the other party? he had completed the grafting of the origin of a great Dao.He had an understanding of the new Dao, knew how to graft it, and had the combat power of a Saint ... In fact, they had all guessed a little, but they found it hard to believe. That guy ... When did he complete the grafting of the great Dao?The ninth Division commander nodded. Everyone had guessed it, but they did not say it out loud.There was no need to say anything more.That person didn't say it, but he might have his own thoughts."What do you two think ... About what the sea Protector said just now?" the ninth Division commander asked.​ General Huai considered for a moment and said,""Actually, it makes sense. Whether it's a new Dao or an old Dao, it's all for the sake of strengthening oneself. It's fine as long as one's heart doesn't change ... There's no need to be bound to the form. I ... I agree with this. In this era, the Dao of origin is indeed too limited!"Obviously, it agreed.The old turtle sighed and said,""I also suggest ... That we change it while the new Dao universe is still weak. Otherwise, when the new Dao universe becomes powerful and we can't graft it, it will be troublesome!"This time, even the Heavenly King had died here.The few of them felt that ... Perhaps, it was time to change.The limitations of the origin Dao were already evident. Without the support of the origin and the continuous transmission of origin, the endurance of Heavenly King experts was limited. Furthermore, after one battle, they might need a long time to recover, just like what they were doing now.However, Li Hao and his group recovered very quickly.Why?The great Dao universe was here!All he had to do was absorb the power of a great Dao!"Let's discuss it after he comes out. "The ninth Division commander thought for a while and nodded.The few of them didn't say anything and fell silent.The city, the soldiers, the people, and now ... Even the main road had been cast in. At this point ... Let's just leave it at that!……Li Hao naturally didn't know what these guys were thinking.

Chapter 2128 Advancing To The Dao Integration Stage (6)
At that moment, the 36 Dao meridians in his body were rapidly merging.Gradually, a sword appeared.It was almost like a physical body!The 36 Dao meridians and 36 giant Dragons actually began to merge together instead of scattering. Li Hao's body, vitality, bones, and flesh were all being strengthened.The small sword was swimming in his body.Li Hao felt the change in his strength!Waves of powerful sword intent continued to spread out.BOOM!A loud rumble was heard, and the great path universe seemed to tremble slightly. At this moment, a new realm was born!Li Hao was also the first new Dao expert to officially reach the Dao integration stage.As for the previous planet, although it was powerful, it hadn't really reached the level of Dao integration. It was just that its battle prowess was already powerful, and after being transferred over, it had become more powerful."This ... Dao integration stage!"Li Hao muttered.At this moment, the river of Dao trembled slightly, and Li Hao's voice seemed to be reflected on all the stars.In that instant, all of the powerful cultivators who had opened their Dao meridians and who had Natal stars, who were all at the mountain and sea realm, suddenly had the same thought in their minds.Dao integration!After the sun and the moon, it would be the Dao integration.Some had even reached the Dao integration stage.The experts of the mountain and sea realm were all moved.The first Dao integration expert had been born in this world!……Silvermoon.The originally worried crowd suddenly heaved a sigh of relief. Someone gasped,""Lord Marquis ... Has advanced to the Dao integration stage!"They knew that it must have been Li Hao.As for why this was the case, who knew?Perhaps Lord Marquis's control over the great Dao had grown stronger.At this moment, everyone was relieved. Not only was the Marquis not dead, but he had also stepped into the realm of Dao integration and officially entered the realm of Saints. This was worthy of celebration!……At the same time.In the West.Ying Hongyue's group suddenly stopped. Ying Hongyue raised her head to look at the sky, and her expression changed slightly. She muttered,"The daomerge ..."Beside him, flying sword immortal and the others also had complex expressions.They, too, had cultivated new DAOs.Therefore, he had also opened his Dao Meridian.At this moment, he also heard the voice of the will. After the sun and moon, it would be the Dao integration!Someone had reached the Dao integration stage!It must be Li Hao!It was too terrifying!They weren't weak at all. Almost all of their leaders had reached the Sun-Moon level, but they still had 36 meridians. From the 10th Meridian onwards, they were still at the Sun-Moon level, and they were still at the Dao integration level all the way to the 36th Meridian.How difficult was it to enter the daomerge?How long has Li Hao been cultivating?But now, he had reached the Dao integration stage and was even able to affect everyone. This was simply too terrifying.…… Not far away from these people, some gods 'faces suddenly changed.Dao integration!Deities were born with great DAOs. At this moment, they also heard the voice that spread from the universe. There were some changes to the new Dao. The sun and moon were no longer the limit. The Dao integration was the limit!At this moment, even the world was shaking. Previously, when a Heavenly King had died, the heaven and earth had trembled as if they were cheering. But now, with the appearance of a Dao integration stage super mighty figure, the heaven and earth trembled once more as heaven's will swept out in all directions.The moon goddesses, who had been favored by the heavens, had a change in expression.Because ... She could feel that heaven's will was leaving her.Heaven's will was also a realistic person.Now, the way of heaven had changed. Someone was ahead of everyone else and had advanced quickly to become a Dao integration expert. This might be the first Saint since the birth of the new Dao. As for the original gods, they were only powerful cultivators of their own Dao lineage and not pure cultivators of the divine path.At this moment, how could the heavens not abandon these people?Clearly, heaven's will was extremely realistic.The king of Dali in the North was probably facing the same result. Heaven's will was leaving him. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "The daomerge ..."The moon goddess gritted her teeth and mumbled,"he actually advanced again ... That's too fast ... Also, he's reached the Dao integration stage, and the world has become even more stable. The world was much weaker before, but it seems to have returned to its previous state. Is he not afraid now?"With Li Hao's advancement, the world seemed to have stabilized. In addition, the chaos in the great wilderness had dissipated a lot.Li Hao ... Didn't seem to be as afraid as before.His choice to advance ... Was the best proof.Li Hao represented the ceiling of Xindao.This way, just like before, some of the old fogeys 'clones could come out, including red dust' s. As for their combat strength, even if they were not as strong as Li Hao 's, some undying fighters and even their original bodies could come out.And Saints ... Might be a bit troublesome, but at the peak of undying, even their true bodies could directly walk out of the ruins.Li Hao ... Wasn't restricting himself anymore?Why?He was so confident, could he deal with those undyings?Although Li Hao had killed a Saint before ... Killing a kingdom of God's Saint was actually a trick.Yueshen's expression became even more complicated as she thought to herself.Would this person be able to take revenge after reaching the Dao integration realm?The key was that this person controlled the great Dao universe, and the godly spirit was still exploring and hadn't done much in-depth research. If this went on, once his Natal star was found by the other party in the great Dao universe, he might be killed across space!……On this day, almost all the new Dao cultivators felt that their cultivation had become smoother, even if they didn't hear the sound.As for the energy of heaven and earth, some of it had dissipated along with the chaos and some of the Saints had died, causing the energy to overflow. Suddenly, the energy of heaven and earth seemed to have become much denser, which also made it easier for some people to cultivate.People continued to open their apertures. Although they didn't know why this was happening, some people felt that it might have something to do with Governor li moving the city and preparing to merge the five continents. All of a sudden, Li Hao became even more of a legend.……Silver City.In the sky.In the seal, under the Stargate, an ancient existence instantly opened his eyes and muttered,""Is the world starting to recover again? It's a good thing!"The recovery of the world had been interrupted.Now, it was starting again.As the world recovered and its energy was released, the seal would become weaker and weaker. A second recovery might not be able to break the seal completely, but a third recovery might be enough.The red moon sovereign revealed a smile, but it quickly turned into a strange expression. The power of the red moon in the Silver Moon world ... Was much weaker than before.Li Hao could probably really get rid of the Crimson Moon's power.This person couldn't be left alive!

Chapter 2129 Face-To-Face Revenge (1)
In the bright star realm, the Galaxy of the great path shook for a while.Li Hao walked out of the Galaxy.The aura on his body was even stronger than before.His entire being became more ethereal and ethereal. The 36 Dao integration techniques had completely fused to form a small sword, and he had officially reached the first level of Dao integration.As for the Dao integration stage, each improvement could be further divided into many smaller stages.Of course, Li Hao didn't care about any of this.It wasn't just these 36 Dao meridians. During the battle just now, Li Hao had opened many apertures. Some of them had automatically closed, but many others had been completely opened.Next, he had to find the second small cycle and continue to find 36 Dao meridians to complete the next stage of cultivation.Or, he could continue with the 360 meridian cycle and open the major circulation aperture.However, it was too time-consuming and energy-consuming to complete the big circulation. It was better to complete the small circulation first. This way, there would be a small transformation at every stage. It was hard to say which was better.Their combat strength would also increase.It depended on the individual's choice and the degree of necessity.For Li Hao, it might be more appropriate to open a small circulation at this time, because the opening of a big circulation required him to open 360 apertures in each round to increase his combat strength. However, opening a Dao Meridian in a small circulation would increase his combat strength.Just as he walked out, his eyes flickered and he looked into the distance.Li Fuhai and the Redwood on the edge seemed to be cultivating something.He turned his head to look, and his heart stirred.The next moment, li Fuhai also sensed Li Hao's presence. He opened his eyes and disappeared from where he was standing. He reappeared in front of Li Hao and smiled."Lord Marquis has come out of seclusion? Congratulations!""It's just a small breakthrough. "Li Hao smiled. He had not really reached the Dao integration stage from the sun Moon tier. In fact, he had the power of Dao integration to begin with, so he had not improved much.Of course, this was indeed a major advancement."The daomerge level is a level of power that can be considered an expert in any era!"Old cow continued to congratulate him. He ignored Li Hao's modesty and said,""Lord Marquis, it seems like there's no one in charge of the Dao of the physical body. There's no one who specializes in it and it's only a minor cultivation. Why don't I condense a planet in my physical body and stabilize my physical body Dao domain?"“……”Li Hao's heart stirred. He hadn't mentioned this, but li Fuhai actually wanted to take the initiative to change paths.After thinking for a while, Li Hao said,""That's fine too ... But the physical body is important. Be it demons or humans, they're all important! There's no urgent need for it yet, but in the future ...""Old bull understands!"Li Fuhai nodded his big bull head."In the future, I will not restrict others from cultivating the path of the physical body. One path is vast and has countless stars. I will only cultivate it and will not occupy an area."Li Hao looked at it for a while and said,""Do as you please."Li Fuhai laughed and didn't speak anymore.It was enough that he had gained Li Hao's approval. The future is the future.You can't just take away my right to cultivate, right?Who asked you to be late?Li Hao, on the other hand, looked at the Redwood in the distance and thought, that guy is studying chaos?In truth, he had only just come into contact with the Dao of chaos.Very weak!If he chose a random area as his main Dao, it would be much stronger than the Dao of chaos.This Redwood ... Was interesting.Of course, chaos should not be weak.However, Li Hao didn't specialize in this Dao. He only focused on the system cultivation. After his Dao Meridian was activated, he usually wouldn't focus on it. If someone focused on one Dao, they would probably achieve great things.It was a little surprising that Sequoia didn't choose the wood or Life series.As for this fellow choosing to cultivate a new Dao ... That was not too surprising.He didn't say anything and left. A moment later, he landed in heaven battling city.In the city, the soldiers and the powerhouses had already returned.At this moment, the ninth master came forward and handed over a storage ring.""There's only some of Zheng Hongyuan's physical strength and immortal strength ... There are no other treasures. His nine-section whip was also broken and he didn't wear a storage ring. He might have left it in the ruins of star suppression city."Li Hao nodded slightly. It was possible.But ... This was not enough.He looked at the void and said,""I killed Zheng Hongyuan before, but I didn't completely annihilate him. Has the great Dao of origins completely disappeared?"Before this, everyone already did not have much energy left.Li Hao also found it difficult to present the other party's great Dao of origins. He was puzzled. This person had been dead for some time. Was the other party's great Dao still in the same place?"After a person dies, their great Dao will remain in the land of death ..." The ninth master said."However, this is the bright star World. We don't know if the other party's great Dao of origin has been expelled or if it's something else."  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao nodded."Let's give it a try. We must exterminate such people. We can't leave any future trouble!""I think ... If we cut off his Dao now, it might attract the attention of Hong Chen, or Zheng Yu. He might only be suspicious now, but once we cut off Zheng Hong Yuan's Dao, he would definitely know ..."Now, Zheng Yu might not be certain. He might have some perception, but it would definitely not be clear.Once his Dao was severed ... The Heavenly King's Dao was severed, and it was his father's Dao at that moment, he would definitely know.Li Hao laughed."You're afraid that he'll go crazy and force his way out. Then, Red Moon Emperor will appear. The world will be in chaos."Li Hao suddenly sneered,"then he can come out!" He would be the first one to die when he came out! Red dust ... Zheng Yu! I want this person to be angry and go crazy. If he chooses to walk out because of his father's death, I'll wait for him to walk out!"
