Moreover, the Silver Moon King Li Hao had previously displayed some unusual techniques that allowed him to teleport in the chaos without the cover of a macro world. This technique was too dangerous!He had to solve this problem. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous for the teleportation of a great world to have fluctuations while the other party's teleportation did not even have much fluctuations.The threat was greater!It was best to eliminate them while they were still weak."Do we need to inform Samsara?"Someone asked. The extreme Ice Emperor wanted to say that the Samsara Emperor was a rank eight venerable. It was obvious that he would not be sent out. Moreover, he was the boss now. However, after thinking about it carefully, he suddenly smiled and nodded.""Alright, let them know. We are aware of the troubles that Samsara is in ... In that case, we will only need two to three rank 7s from the Samsara realm!"That's good!He could not touch the eighth-grade ones, but a few seventh-grade ones would do.If he really died ... It wouldn't be a bad idea to further weaken Samsara.Soon, everyone reached an agreement.The existence of people like Li Hao would always prompt some people to join forces, and this time was no exception. The East, which had been scattered for many years, was showing signs of joining forces this time.……At this moment, the Samsara Emperor, who received the news, sneered."It seems like Extreme Ice wants to be the Overlord. Unfortunately, this position isn't that easy!" Sending people to support him ... How could two or three people be enough? Four rank seven venerable sovereigns!"He looked at the weak eighth level venerable sovereigns beside him, and his eyes changed. After a long time, he said in a deep voice,""While they're dealing with the Thunder World ... We ... Will find the human King. It's best if we can kill him! "If not, we'll dig out the new martial artists and drive them out!"Fu Sheng, who had just been resurrected, was full of hatred. He gritted his teeth and said, "I'm definitely going to kill that guy!"This time, the reincarnation Emperor had paid a huge price to resurrect them. A portion of their combat strength would still be lost.But at least he was resurrected and maintained his power of the eighth step.However, the price was not small. Their lifespans were almost cut in half. To them, although they did not have to worry about their lifespans now that they had reached the eighth rank, they could clearly feel that the time they could live was much less.There were also grade 8 and Grade 7 corpses, large amounts of great Dao crystals, world origins ...Such a consumption was too terrifying.Moreover, Samsara had become a vassal of chaos heaven world ... Although they were an Alliance in name, to Fu Sheng, wasn't this just a vassal?His dream of becoming an Overlord was shattered!The reincarnation Emperor glanced at Fu Sheng and said,""You've already died once, so don't be impulsive! The first revival is fine, but the second or third ... Even if you have sufficient resources, the second revival might exhaust your lifespan and cause you to die. Now, you're already half-dead, understand?"Fu Sheng still hated it, but he could only nod.This time, it was too tragic.Moreover, he was also a little afraid of the human King.The reincarnation Emperor did not say anything more. He looked into the distance where the Thunder World was. The extreme Ice and the others had discussed for many days, but the Thunder World did not escape or disappear. What were these guys from the four regions thinking?Or did they think that the powerhouses from the East would not join forces against them?It would be too childish to think that way.It was impossible on normal days, but once someone caused a fatal threat, cooperation was inevitable.At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor stopped thinking about it. Extreme Ice and the others had saved him a lot of trouble by dealing with this group of people.

Chapter 3411 Path Of Ten Thousand Worlds (1)
The Thunder World depended on it.However, the interior was already empty, with nothing left.Just as the eastern realms were preparing to attack the Thunder World, Li Hao had already left with his men.He left quietly.Unlike the human King, who was ostentatious and kept a low profile, Li Hao, who had reached Level Seven, was even better at concealing himself.There were also some people around him.The group of advanced venerable sovereigns came and went freely.Without the burden of the world, Thunderlord and Sen Lan's strength had improved. Of course, their peak combat power was definitely not as strong as when they were in the local world and could work together. However, with their great power, they were not much weaker than before.Today, Li Hao's side had many powerhouses.However, for Li Hao, what he lacked the most right now was an expert who was strong enough to make a name for himself. The level 8 daoqi, Wushan, and Thunderlord were only the weak among the level 8 experts, which the three level 8 experts had to admit.It was either that the time for advancement was too short, or that a weapon spirit like Dao chess had attained Dao. The function of Dao chess was not to kill, but to assist, so the killing power was not too strong.The three rank eights might be able to fight a human King together, but they should not be as good as the reincarnation sovereign. They were even weaker than the Dragon Lord.However, the human King realm had only just advanced to the eighth step.As time went on, it would be difficult for the three of them to be a match.……Primal Chaos void.The sixth heaven.This time, Li Hao didn't take anyone to the third heaven. It was easy to encounter advanced venerable sovereigns, but they wouldn't come to the middle three heavens. It was rare for advanced venerable sovereigns to go to the middle and low six heavens.There was clearly no barrier, but it was the human heart that blocked the world.They were heading south.Li Hao still wanted to take a look in the South. Along the way, they would find a suitable place to construct the chaosverse. They would also need to collect a large amount of chaos energy, comprehend some great DAOs, and absorb more orthodoxies to complete the construction of the infinite worlds.Because the goal of this trip wasn't to kill or to seize the realm, there were more people.This included some Silver Moon martial masters. Apart from those who were still in seclusion in the Li realm, Li Hao would let them out if they wanted to. As for the venerable sovereigns in the Thunder World and the forest orchid world, if they did not want to sleep and chose to leave, Li Hao would not stop them.There were many people. In the square region, a trip with so many venerable sovereigns would cause a lot of noise and attract people's attention. However, in the outer region, a group of venerable sovereigns was not too eye-catching.There were too many worlds in the outer region, much more than the square region. In addition to the recent chaos, many venerable sovereigns didn't dare to travel alone. Most of them were venerable sovereigns of a world who would go out in groups to collect some resources or chaotic force.In the outer region, venerable sovereigns cultivated. Because there were few upper three heavens, the chaotic force was rich and there was a large amount of chaotic force between the barriers. For many venerable sovereigns who did not dare to cross ranks, it was much easier to collect chaotic force at the barriers.As a result, there were many venerable sovereigns on the barren islands between the sixth and seventh heavens who cultivated or absorbed the chaotic force to perfect their great DAOs. After letting go of their desire to invade, Li Hao's group's mentality had changed a little. They were much more relaxed.They were not too concerned about whether the Thunder World would be attacked.At this moment, separated by a layer of heaven, everything that happened in the upper three heavens seemed to have nothing to do with the people of the middle three heavens.In the East, the destruction of the eighth-rank twin universes and the heavy damage to the eighth-rank reincarnation worlds seemed to only affect the transcendent powers. For the others, they were still living their lives the way they should.It had nothing to do with them.Li Hao also discovered that the order and popularity of the middle three heavens were much better than that of the upper three heavens. The venerable sovereigns here were relatively more peaceful and not too overbearing.He could even meet some venerable sovereigns here and on the way. They would not be on guard when they met. Instead, they would take the initiative to exchange a few words.In the square region and the outer three heavens, Li Hao only saw the cold law of the jungle.It was much better here.The sixth heaven should only exist in a sixth rank world. However, even if a venerable sovereign of the lower three heavens entered this place, not many people seemed to care. The division of levels between the middle and low-rank venerable sovereigns was not as strict and cold as that of the high-rank venerable sovereigns.Li Hao's group walked in the void as if they were walking on flat ground.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  There were also some venerable sovereigns coming and going in the surroundings. Some of them would glance at them, while others would ignore them. They did their own things and did not attract much attention.There were also some venerable sovereigns who followed behind. Perhaps they felt that it was safer to go with a large group of venerable sovereigns. They were not afraid of the large group of venerable sovereigns. It would be interesting if they turned around and attacked him."It looks like there might be a deserted island in front of us."On the chaotic desolate Island, in the trading market between the strongholds.There were many venerable sovereigns coming and going, and many of them were following Li Hao's group. They were probably going to the market and the deserted island.This group of people didn't know much about the outer region.Thearch Kang Han, who had been their guide, had been released by Li Hao. Now, they were not familiar with this place and only knew the directions. They headed south.At this moment, the people following Li Hao were none other than a group of pincers that even the Silver Moon martial masters were unfamiliar with.An authentic outsider.Giant pincer had been staying in Silver Moon since he had advanced to venerable sovereign. This time, giant pincer had chosen to leave Silver Moon. After advancing to venerable sovereign, giant pincer did not have high expectations of himself.

Chapter 3412 The Path Of Ten Thousand Worlds (1)
He didn't expect to enter the intermediate level or even the advanced level.As for the giant pincer, it had been a guide or a servant of the venerable sovereign for many years in the Hui long temple. It had nothing else to do this time. Unlike the other Silver Moon martial masters who looked around, the giant pincer had been paying attention to Li Hao's every move.He looked like a servant and a Butler. Li Hao had said that there was no need to do so, but the giant pincer did not listen, so Li Hao did not say anything more.Hearing Li Hao's words, the giant pincer said in a hurry,""My Lord, I'll go and find out the situation ..."According to his habit, he should have asked her earlier.However, he didn't dare to leave rashly. Li Hao and his group were wanted criminals in the East. He was worried that Li Hao would misunderstand if he left now.Although he didn't think Li Hao would go so far as to leave, he was still very careful. Even if he left, he would inform Li Hao in advance."Okay, be careful."Li Hao nodded slightly, and the giant pincer left without delay.Beside him, Kong Ji laughed."There are so many of us. Those who don't know would think that some realm Lord's daughter is traveling with a group of venerable sovereigns. I've never experienced such a scene in the past."As a rank eight son, there were many venerable sovereigns in the world of light back then. When they went out alone, they were usually protected by venerable sovereigns. However, he was a loner and rarely brought a large number of venerable sovereigns out. Later on, only one of them acted as his liaison.However, Kong Ji knew that in the past, some children of high-level venerable sovereigns would bring many venerable sovereigns with them for the sake of their reputation."It's said in the book that it's very easy to meet some second generation martial artists who find trouble in this kind of situation. Brother Haoyue, if we meet them, do you think we can conveniently ... Beat up the young one, and then beat up the old one?"Li Hao chuckled."Where Are You Reading novels, brother kongji? Those who roam the primordial chaos are all venerable sovereigns, and it's rare for them to find trouble for no reason. We've been roaming the void for quite some time now, and although venerable sovereigns are both stupid and smart, I don't think we've ever met a venerable sovereign who actively sought trouble in the primordial chaos?" Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  There were strong venerable sovereigns, weak ones, and stupid ones.However, no matter how stupid a venerable Emperor was, Li Hao had been in the chaos for years, and he had never encountered a second venerable Emperor who took the initiative to pick a fight with him. At this level, it was extremely rare.He had not met many children of advanced venerable sovereigns, but people like Kong Ji either ignored him or treated him as a friend. Even the fire Phoenix's daughter had been polite to him, although they had become enemies in the end.However, he didn't meet anyone who took the initiative to find trouble.Kong Ji laughed."That's a bit of a pity. "He then added,"I can't wait to encounter some. Now, in order to achieve our goal, a large amount of world power and great Dao power can't be lacking. We won't cause trouble, but if someone comes looking for trouble, it's not bad to take a load of it along the way." Li Hao chuckled.This fellow was really different from before."Let's take a walk and see. "Li Hao didn't reply. He looked around and said,""I can vaguely feel the meaning of the nine Heavens."Previously, he did not have a clear feeling.However, at this moment, he had some thoughts. He slowly said,""I didn't think it was necessary to divide the nine Heavens. It's actually useless ... But now it seems that there are some benefits. We are all at the same level. As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together!""In the square domain, high-level worlds and low-and mid-level worlds are mixed together. This also causes the low-and mid-level worlds near the high-level worlds to live in fear. They may be devoured at any time. They may encounter experts from the high-level worlds at any time and become either vassals or food ...""Here, although their status seems to be lower, the separation of the high-level worlds has also allowed the venerable sovereigns in the lower-and middle-level worlds to live more comfortably and freely ..."It seemed like the rules were stricter, and the division of ranks was more obvious.Previously, Li Hao had felt that this wasn't very good and that it was unfair.However, walking in the middle three heavens felt ... Quite good.His original goal was the fairness of the world and the harmonious chaos.Now that he thought about it, he was a little naive.As a Martial Master of the pugilistic world, he should understand that where there were people, there would be pugilistic worlds. It was impossible for the world to be harmonious, so the best way was to separate people into different levels ... When the strong interacted with the strong, or when the strong entered the world of the weak, some disciplinary measures should be set up.In this way, the strong would not attack the weak when they came to the territory of the weak. The weak would know that the strong would pay a price, but they had the ability to kill the weak. This way, they would be more respectful, but they would not rashly provoke them, nor would they be afraid.For example, Grade 7 and Grade 8 experts of the upper three heavens could come and interact with the middle three heavens. However, once the energy they triggered exceeded a certain limit, the primal Chaos lightning tribulation would appear again. This was a pretty good method of restriction.They wouldn't let the powerhouses be unbridled, but they wouldn't really let the powerhouses be so greatly restricted that they couldn't even enter some places.At this moment, Li Hao had some other ideas.Also, in the war between worlds, the big fish ate the small fish, and the small fish ate the shrimp ... This was not a good thing. No matter how many worlds there were, they could not withstand such a mutual devouring. There was a good thing about chaos, which was that worlds could be born naturally.In this way, no matter how much he lost, he wouldn't feel much. He would naturally recover with time.

Chapter 3413 Path Of Ten Thousand Worlds (3)
However ... Li Hao felt that if his pseudo-chaos could not naturally give birth to new worlds, it would not take long for the entire chaos to become a world if it devoured like this.He had to let the powerhouses understand that devouring the world was not the way to cultivate. Moreover, he had to eliminate this possibility from the root.For example, he could give the world the ability to self-destruct, and once it was devoured, it would self-destruct.They should also give the realm some self-resistance and self-restriction power. Once an outsider appears, the realm's suppression will appear. This kind of power should be very strong and enough to suppress most experts.Li Hao was deep in thought.It was better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books.At this moment, Li Hao was thinking as he walked. His goal was to perfect his fake chaotic world and create an ideal world instead of the chaos he had today.The current chaos was too chaotic. The big fish ate the small fish, and the small fish ate the shrimp. This was an eternal truth.However, in the chaos, it was too obvious, too rampant, and too unscrupulous. There was no need to do anything on the surface. Countless worlds were devoured. Even if the outer regions were divided into Nine Heavens, the effect was not too obvious.The strong could still do as they pleased.The strong also started from the weak. It was unfair to limit the strong, but the strong could not restrain themselves. They could only use external means to restrain them.Thoughts kept appearing in his mind.Soon, the giant pincers returned.He had just gone to the back and chatted with some venerable sovereigns. Now, he returned to Li Hao and said in a hurry,""My Lord, the Alliance City of the middle world is in front of us!""This deserted island is very famous in the lower three heavens and middle three heavens! It's a trading Island created by many powerful rank six worlds. There's more than one island, and it's a place that many low and mid-stage venerable sovereigns like to go to. It's relatively safe and has some guarantees. ""In order to protect themselves, the small and medium-sized worlds have some alliances. They are usually unremarkable, but once they are attacked, these worlds will join forces and move faster than some alliances of the major worlds! They were created to prevent the invasion of some great worlds ..."Li Hao nodded slightly. This was not bad."My Lord, there's a place in the middle world Alliance City that you might like," the giant pincer said hurriedly.Li Hao tilted his head. The giant pincer explained,"it's said that there's usually a Dao discussion arena in the middle world Alliance City. Venerable sovereigns who have doubts about their own great Dao can go in to ask about it and Exchange ideas about the great Dao ... Although there aren't many, there are some. In order to impose some restrictions, their identities can be hidden. Not only that, but they also need to pay a great Dao crystal to enter. It's quite expensive. This way, some venerable sovereigns can be restricted from entering!""It's said that one can even visit the great Dao universe on some of the deserted islands ..."Li Hao was stunned."The Dao universe?""Right!""Yes." The giant pincer nodded."This is also something that many venerable sovereigns like very much. Of course, it's mainly some sixth-tier worlds that have given birth to great Dao universes ... And the cost of visiting is very high! Under normal circumstances, a middle world Alliance City has a level-six great path universe world in charge. If the other party is willing, they will allow some venerable sovereigns to visit. This is also to attract itinerant cultivators or a portion of Middle Worlds to join ..."Li Hao's interest was instantly piqued.Although he had already reached Level Seven and had seen many great worlds and even devoured many great worlds ... He had never taken the initiative to visit someone else's great path universe.Even a level-six great world like Senlan wouldn't rashly open a great Dao universe in the four-sided zone."Aren't they afraid that others will forcibly seize the great Dao universe?"Li Hao was confused and shocked at how bold these guys were.Aren't you afraid? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  "I've asked them about that too. According to them, the Alliance of the middle Worlds has many worlds that are allied with each other. There are many similar large worlds. When one side is attacked, all parties have the obligation to join forces to kill the person who seized it. Even if it is a high-level venerable sovereign, if One World can not defeat him, many worlds can naturally defeat him ..."Li Hao nodded.The giant pincer continued,"furthermore, the fees aren't low. This is also a part of such worlds. Unfortunately, if they want to enter a level Seven world, they will need a large number of great Dao crystals. Relying on their own world to absorb them is too slow. By opening it to the outside world, they can collect a portion of the great Dao crystals and speed up the world's advancement! A portion of the current rank 7 worlds were Born This Way, so the middle world Alliance is actually quite a powerful force in the rank 7 worlds. ""Although these worlds have advanced, they are slightly weaker among the rank 7s. They will still band together and have a close relationship with the middle world Alliance!"Li Hao was deep in thought. At this moment, his interest was piqued."Shall we go and take a look?" he looked at the others and smiled.At the side, the Thunder monarch and the others didn't care. Wu Shan also laughed and said,"You can make the decision. It's a rare experience to walk around. It's rare to have such an experience in the square region. The rank 6 macro worlds in the square region are all hidden. I'm sure Senlan knows this well. Who would dare to let foreign venerable sovereigns in?"Monarch Senlan said in a deep voice,"there aren't many level-six worlds in the square region, so they can't join forces. If they do, they can't defeat a great world, so we naturally have to be more vigilant. There are many level-six great worlds here. If they join forces, they can indeed compete with level-seven great worlds. They're naturally qualified to open the great path universe."

Chapter 3414 Path Of Ten Thousand Worlds (3)
Li Hao and the others nodded.No matter what, everyone was in a good mood now that they had encountered an open Dao universe.But soon, the giant pincer said carefully,""Your Excellency, it is said that ... The price is not small!"“……”Everyone was speechless.Is paying right?Do we ... Have money?They had conquered many worlds and seized many great Dao crystals, but there were also many experts. Furthermore, they were all newly-advanced experts, so they had to consume a lot of energy. This also led to the fact that despite their strength, they were all short of money.At this moment, the group of people looked at each other. Soon, someone's eyes revealed a fierce look. Then ... Let's do it again?Li Hao thought for a moment and smiled."It's simple. We're a group of advanced venerable sovereigns. Don't we have a training hall there?" If he went to discuss Dao with someone, he would at least gain something or give some advice to other venerable sovereigns ... Why would he be afraid of not having money? We really don't have any money ... The number of Dao crystals we can condense in a day is an astronomical figure. Don't always think about snatching them. "When everyone heard this, they felt that it made sense.How could a group of advanced venerable sovereigns be short of money?If they really wanted to condense a great Dao crystal, with so many advanced venerable sovereigns, it was possible for them to condense hundreds of thousands of them in a day. For many people, this was already an astronomical figure. "Let's go and take a look. "Li Hao smiled. Perhaps this was the place he had hoped to see on his way here.Although they were all low-and mid-level venerable sovereigns, at this level, everyone had some understanding of their own great Dao. For him, a large number of low-and mid-level venerable sovereigns might be more useful than a few high-leveled venerable sovereigns.……While Li Hao was heading toward the deserted island.Outside the Thunder World, a group of venerable sovereigns were extremely vigilant and were approaching carefully.In the distance, a realm stood still, but the group of venerable sovereigns still looked solemn. Li Hao's side was not weak. As far as they knew, there were two level 8s and many Level 7s.It was even more difficult to deal with than the Twin universes.If they attacked rashly, it was very easy to cause losses. Furthermore, this was the territory of the Thunder World. The Thunder Emperor who was overseeing the local territory was even more powerful.This time, five level eight venerable sovereigns were dispatched. One of them was a level eight venerable sovereign from the extreme Ice world.At this moment, the venerable sovereign was extremely careful. He sent a message to all parties and said seriously,""Be careful. Once we make contact, we'll kill two level eights and silver Moon King Li Hao first. We don't have to worry about the neo martial artists. The others will also pay attention to this place. Once the neo martial artists or the dragons participate, they'll be stopped by others!"The venerable sovereigns were all in awe.Soon, some venerable sovereigns headed in the direction of the Thunder World. They were getting closer and closer, but the closer they got, the more surprised they became.He did not feel the pressure of the entire universe being covered by the Thunder World.Could it be that the Thunder World didn't even cover the nearby areas?For the great world, the scope covered by the universe was the scope of investigation. Were these people crazy or vigilant? they had compressed the universe to their own world and strengthened the defense of their own world? ……  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Just as the various parties were probing the Thunder World.At this moment, he was roaming the primal Chaos void and heading in a certain direction.Because not long ago, someone had seen the human King.That arrogant fellow didn't seem to have thought of hiding his tracks. Perhaps he was confident, perhaps he was arrogant, or perhaps he wasn't afraid of being ambushed by experts ...In that case, the reincarnation Emperor did not mind taking a look.While the Thunder World was being besieged, there would definitely be some movement. Perhaps, he could also get rid of the cancer known as new martial!This time, he was in the front, followed by a large number of venerable sovereigns. This time, the Samsara venerable Emperor was determined, or rather, he was desperate. He didn't even do much to defend his Samsara.The three resurrected rank eights followed behind him. There was even a rank eight venerable sovereign from the West who represented hun Tian.There were five tier 8 experts!He wasn't weak, and the one from the West wasn't weak either. The human King was strong, and there might still be one or two tier 8 neo martial artists, but ... What about five tier 8?You, human King, can you continue to be so arrogant?Not long after, the reincarnation sovereign felt a strong aura. The human King was truly arrogant. He didn't even bother to hide his aura. He had just killed several venerable sovereigns of the world of reincarnation, but this guy didn't even bother to hide it.……In front.The human King was wandering around. Recently, he had visited some worlds and seen some. He had also fought with some high-level venerable sovereigns. Of course, most of them were sparring. He forced himself to spar to perfect his own orthodoxy.He didn't plan to keep a low profile. His path was different from Li Hao 's.Keeping a low profile was not in line with his personality.After leaving neo martial arts, he had not kept a low profile.At this moment, the human King suddenly turned around and frowned. Reincarnation?That fellow actually abandoned the world of reincarnation and came here directly?That ... Was crazy.Samsara no longer had a rank eight venerable sovereign, and this guy was the only one left. More importantly, the Samsara realm was powerful and had abundant resources. Wasn't he afraid of being wiped out?The human King was a little puzzled.Even if he didn't hide his whereabouts, he thought that the other worlds might join forces to deal with him. However, the Samsara Emperor should be licking his wounds at home. Why would he come out so easily?Therefore, he was not afraid of any venerable sovereign in the East.However, at this moment, the reincarnation Emperor had caught up.

Chapter 3415 Path Of Ten Thousand Worlds (1)
It was really surprising!The human King frowned and looked around. He felt that something was wrong, but he didn't run away quickly. Some thoughts appeared in his mind.The reincarnation Emperor was very strong!Previously, when he fought with long Zhan, although he was slightly suppressed, it did not mean that he was not strong. If he was not strong, he would have been killed by long Zhan Long ago. However, the other party was not injured. He was just no match for long Zhan and had to retreat.One should know that the Dragon Lord had injured the light Emperor with two punches. Obviously, the reincarnation Emperor was much stronger than the light Emperor.As for the human King, he was also eager to try. He had really never fought with such an expert before. Even the Dragon Lord had only exchanged a single move previously, and he had suffered some losses.Even though he felt that the other party had something to rely on, at this moment, the human King still decided to stay and try to fight with the other party.The premise was that the other party really came to find trouble with him.Of course, even if he didn't look for trouble ... He wouldn't let go of this opportunity.The next moment, the human King headed straight in the direction he had sensed.The reincarnation Emperor, who was in pursuit, suddenly laughed."The human King is indeed bold!"Despite knowing that he had arrived, not only did the other party not escape, he even took the initiative to welcome him. This fellow was truly bold.Soon, the human King appeared.He looked at the other side and examined it once more. His eyes changed for a moment before he smiled,""It seems that the Samsara Emperor came for me. Aren't you afraid that Silvermoon's side will destroy your home? Or ... Has someone already gone to deal with them?""Just as the human King has thought, at this moment, the various realms of Extreme Ice are besieging the Thunder realm."The reincarnation Emperor laughed and looked at the human King. "It's said that the human King's Dao of yin and yang has already reached the transformation realm, but I'm good at life and death! The human King took the initiative to provoke Samsara and killed all of Samsara's experts. If you don't give us an explanation, we won't be able to explain ourselves!""Then what's there to say?"The human King laughed and didn't waste any words. At this moment, he directly revealed his inner world.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The chaos seemed to be isolated!He slashed his saber at his opponent. Yin and yang appeared in this saber. Although he had left neo martial, it didn't mean that he didn't know yin and yang. At this moment, black and white alternated between heaven and earth. Yin and yang appeared like the two elements of Tai Chi!Under the intertwining of yin and yang, it was as if one was placed between life and death.The reincarnation Emperor laughed and said nothing more. Life and death appeared. Instantly, the sky changed color and black and white alternated. Countless Dao laws appeared and suppressed the world.As the two experts clashed, the surrounding void seemed to be completely cut apart.A piece of desolate stone in the chaos was first attacked by yin and yang, then covered by life and death. Yin and yang rotated, life and death reincarnated. Not only was this stone not destroyed, it even showed signs of turning into a spirit.The two experts didn't care and didn't care.The void trembled and tens of thousands of DAOs appeared!Behind the human Kings, illusions of human Kings appeared one after another. Every human King slashed out with a blade, and under the Samsara of life and death, the countless illusions instantly turned into dead spirits and disappeared into the chaos. The human King continuously attacked with his saber at an unbelievable speed, taking the initiative to engage in close combat.After a while, the human King groaned. He was slightly injured and was not his match. There was still a gap between the two of them. Although it was not too big, he was still not as good as the reincarnation Emperor.However, in this case, there was hope for victory, but it was almost impossible to determine life and death.Even if Samsara wanted to kill the king of killers, it would be as difficult as ascending to heaven.But the next moment, the human King suddenly pulled out his blade, turned around, and ran. He cursed,""We agreed on a one-on-one fight, but you still insist on a group fight. Do you have any shame?"He sensed it.At this moment, even though he was cursing, his expression was slightly grave. He was resurrected?He wasn't too surprised. He had tried to resurrect someone before, but to resurrect a level eight venerable sovereign ... How much would it cost?And it wasn't just one, but three!Did the reincarnation sovereign have the ability to revive three dead rank eight venerable sovereigns?This was something that the human King had not expected!This was big trouble!Four level 8s ... No, there seemed to be one more. Where did he come from?With all sorts of thoughts running through his mind, the human King did not delay any further. He quickly dove into the void. If it was a one-on-one battle, he could still try if he could not win. However, if it was a one-on-five battle ... That would be courting death. Although he was arrogant, he would not court death.In the next moment, an eighth level venerable sovereign appeared in front of him. He threw a punch with a cold expression, blocking the human King's path.The arrogant human King must pay the price for his arrogance!Behind him, the reincarnation sovereign didn't say anything. His reincarnation Dao domain appeared, covering the sky and the sun. It enveloped the area where the human King was. With a palm strike, life and death appeared. A passageway opened up, as if it was going to drag the human King into hell.Grade 8 experts appeared in all directions.As for the human King, he slashed with his blade and broke through the sky. He was also cursing non-stop, but he didn't delay his escape. His speed was extremely fast. He had long been used to running when he couldn't win, so his escape was also extremely tricky.The two sides fought again and again in the air. The five level 8s chased closely and kept shrinking the encirclement, trying to destroy the human King!……Because of the Dao domain's coverage, the commotion caused by the battle between the two sides was not as great as the previous time.This time, Li Hao didn't sense any of this.At this moment, Li Hao had already arrived at the Alliance City of the middle world. When the Thunder World was surrounded and the human King was killed, Li Hao did not know about this.At this moment, Li Hao was quite interested in the city that stood in the chaotic void.After walking around and looking around, they finally stopped in front of a place that seemed to be sealed off from the world.

Chapter 3416 Path Of Ten Thousand Worlds (1)
There was no one guarding this place.Only some rules were recorded on a stone tablet. Those who entered had to pay 100000 great Dao crystals. There were venerable sovereigns discussing the Dao, public discussion areas, and relatively closed small spaces, provided that they were invited.His true body didn't enter, but his mind. It was like an illusion, where they could exchange great DAOs and hide their identities.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Every person who entered had to pay 100000 great Dao crystals. This was not a small amount. Of course, for venerable sovereigns, it was not too difficult to reserve some.Even if it was a first level venerable sovereign, if he really wanted to gather them, he could do so with some time.A portion of these great Dao crystals were used to maintain the existence of the illusion. After all, an illusion that could conceal auras and auras required a large number of great Dao crystals to maintain its activation.​ The other portion would be given as rewards to the venerable sovereigns in the public area. If they were recognized by many venerable sovereigns, they would receive a portion of the Dao crystals as a reward."Myriad Dao Pavilion!"Li Hao mumbled and looked at the plaque above the palace. This place was rather interesting.This place was filled with smoke, and it was somewhat looming. There seemed to be some venerable sovereigns around, but it was difficult to detect each other. These people's physical bodies would remain in the same place, and their minds would enter an illusion. This way, although it was known that the people in the illusion were all cultivators in this place, it was difficult to judge who exactly they were."Good idea, good idea!"Li Hao mumbled and nodded again.Beside him, Kong Ji and the others nodded. This was a good idea. At this moment, Kong Ji said,""It's a pity that it can't cover a large area. Otherwise, if it could cover the entire primordial chaos, as long as we can enter the illusory realm, we'll be able to communicate with each other. It will be of even greater help to the spread of the great Dao ..."The person who built this myriad Dao Pavilion was definitely a true cultivator. It was a good idea.If he could take it one step further and spread the illusory realm all over the chaos, he could enter any place at any time. Entering as an illusory person would definitely be of great help to the spread of the great Dao.At this moment, there were still many limitations.The chaos was too vast. Other than some top-notch great worlds called bed universes, which could cover a larger area, others 'Dao domains could not cover a large area. As such, it was very difficult to construct this illusion.But Kong Ji's words stunned Li Hao."An illusion that covers a large area and allows many people to enter it to discuss the Dao?" Li Hao was slightly stunned. He fell into deep thought and did not rush to enter the myriad Dao Pavilion. Instead, he looked at the others and suddenly said,""What do you think? I'll set up an illusionary realm with the river of time as the base and connect all places so that countless venerable sovereigns can enter it to discuss Dao and communicate ... In this way, as the main guide, I can absorb the knowledge of waking up people faster, right?"Everyone was stunned and fell into deep thought.Soon, monarch Wushan frowned.""Didn't you say that some peak existences can sense the river of time?"At the very least, the Dragon Lord had sensed it back then.If so, it would be very dangerous.Once someone sensed their existence and traced it back to its source, they would be able to find the location of the time star directly. That would be very troublesome."That was in the past. I wasn't strong before, but now I'm at grade-7 ... Although I haven't made much progress in the Dao of time, it's very difficult for ordinary people to find the location of the time star now ..."Li Hao was a little tempted."If I can construct such a domain ... I can cooperate with the world Alliance and connect all the regions in their myriad Dao Pavilion ... They have customer resources, and what we need is Dao inspirations. No matter what their purpose is, we can negotiate. Whether it's for resources, Dao inspirations, or other things ... There might not be any conflict."Li Hao's interest was piqued. He said,""I'll go in and take a look. If you're interested, you can go in and take a look too. As expected, walking is better than talking. Now, what I lack is the basic way. As for the profound great way, all of you around me are seventh or eighth level venerable sovereigns. I've also peeked into a lot of ninth level ways. On the other hand, I've only learned a little about these basic ways from the Dao chess and the Thunder region ..."Li Hao had another idea.He was extremely happy.There might be new ways to use the time star and the time river, but hun Dun was still at the middle and low level venerable sovereigns. There were many more of them than there were at the high level venerable sovereigns.If these people were willing to enter the river of time, the price of entering would be some great Dao insights. Was everyone willing?Perhaps he was willing.For middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns, such a place could only be built by Almighties. If the Almighties wanted to kill you, it was very simple. You had to pay some great Dao Comprehension in order to get what you wanted. What would happen then?"I have a lot of high-level venerable sovereigns on my side. I can use the low-level great Dao inspirations to exchange for the high-level great Dao inspirations. If I can combine everyone's great Dao inspirations ... I can exchange them with each other ... In this way, I can really comprehend the myriad DAOs."Had the other venerable sovereigns ever thought of such a thing?

Chapter 3417 The Path Of Ten Thousand Worlds (1)
They might have thought of it, but it was very difficult to achieve, because there was no universe called bed that could really cover the entire chaos.It was too difficult!The river of time could not be used now. However, if the Qianjie were to be used as a base point and spread to various places, the area covered by the kapok could be used as a territory.It would be bigger than the great world!It was much, much bigger!Of course, no one would dare to go in the beginning. No one would believe it, unless ... All the venerable sovereigns in the middle world Alliance City were pulled in. The other party had been established for many years and had a certain degree of credibility.All these thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind. At this moment, Li Hao had no interest in the human King.At this moment, he was very excited.When he entered the illusionary land, he became even more excited. As soon as he entered, he felt as if he had appeared in a square. He seemed to have only entered with his mind, and it was very illusionary. There were many such ghostly existences around him.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, it seemed like someone was preaching.Li Hao hurriedly listened.It was impossible to judge the strength of the person who was preaching the Dao from his aura, but those who could enter were at least venerable sovereigns. The Dao of venerable sovereigns had some unique points. At this moment, this person was preaching the water element Dao, which was considered a basic great Dao.There was laughter all around. Some people seemed to be muttering that it was another basic great Dao, and they didn't seem too satisfied.However, this was Li Hao's first time experiencing this.As a rank seven venerable sovereign, he was listening attentively."Water is the most rigid and soft! A drop of water was so fast that it could even pierce through a world. This was steel! "As for softness, water can change thousands of times and merge with all things. One punch can split mountains and crack the earth, but it's difficult to break a River ..."This venerable sovereign might not be too powerful, and the Dao he taught was not profound.For Li Hao, this might be some basic abilities of the water element, but at this moment, hearing others talk about it was an eye-opener for him. He was knowledgeable and had listened to countless high-level venerable sovereigns preach, but it was a different story when a low-level venerable sovereign who specialized in water taught.Around them, some venerable sovereigns were already getting impatient. They felt that this was too shallow. Obviously, the evaluation this time would not be too high. Every venerable sovereign who entered had the right to evaluate these cultivators who were giving public lectures.If the evaluation was high, these cultivators would receive a lot of Dao crystals as a reward. This was also why many cultivators were willing to give public lectures.If the rating was low, there would naturally be no reward. After a while, the water element venerable sovereign helplessly lost his spirit. It was obvious that he knew that no one was buying it and that he had wasted his breath.Li Hao, on the other hand, was slightly excited.There were venerable sovereigns who were willing to share their insights and DAOs with some rewards. Moreover, no one would care who you were or which venerable sovereign you were because of your secret identity ...It was safe, and there was a certain guarantee.Wasn't this the kind of situation and environment he was looking for?He had come into contact with too many advanced venerable sovereigns in the four regions and the outer regions, but none of them had given him such a feeling. He only felt killing, plundering, and devouring ...But here, in a medium-sized world, such an event was held. Although the scale was small ... For Li Hao, this was perhaps the greatest reward he had gained from this trip.Li Hao was overjoyed!At that moment, he saw the hope of perfecting the ten thousand DAOs and the hope of successfully constructing the pseudo-Chaos World.The premise was to be able to construct such a huge domain that covered all directions, allowing the venerable sovereigns in the middle and lower six heavens to have the opportunity to enter at any time instead of deliberately rushing to a certain place, because some venerable sovereigns did not dare to leave the world easily. "I think I've found the right path ..."At this moment, Li Hao was overjoyed.Of course, a large amount of resources must have been consumed, including the rewards for the venerable sovereigns. Of course, if it was the same as this place, where the entrance fee was charged and the resources collected were given back to the venerable sovereigns, it shouldn't have cost much.Many thoughts appeared in his mind.At this moment, Li Hao no longer had the mood to think about whether the human King was being besieged ...Moreover, he didn't think that the human King would be besieged and killed."To construct an incomparably vast Dao domain, the river of time, covering the Eastern Region ..."Li Hao couldn't stop thinking about this.The path of myriad realms might have to start from here.

Chapter 3418 Negotiation (1)
Myriad Dao Pavilion.Venerable sovereigns would come out from time to time to give Dao lectures in the illusion square. No matter whether they were good or bad, they did not touch on the core of the Dao. Even so, Li Hao listened quietly and gained something.When three people travel, there must be a teacher.When one reached the venerable sovereign level, no matter how strong or weak one was, no matter how weak or powerful one's great Dao was, they would all have their own insights into the great Dao.Different civilizations, different races, different languages, different mantras. Even the same great Dao could be cultivated in completely different directions. This was the great Dao.They were all five elements, but they might be completely different. Some people could cultivate the Dao of fire into a great Dao that was similar to ice-sealing, some could cultivate the Dao of fire into a civilization's inheritance, and some could cultivate the Dao of fire into a light-like Dao that lit up the light.The fire in everyone's heart was different.On this day, Li Hao had been listening attentively and didn't say anything.Some venerable sovereigns were only there to listen, but they didn't speak.As for some venerable sovereigns, if they were to the liking of others after their lectures, the venerable sovereigns who were listening could give comments. The evaluation was very simple. As long as they gave some spirit and passed through the illusion, they would give a good review. The entire myriad Dao Pavilion would reward the venerable sovereigns based on the feedback.Of course, with this method, if there were enough venerable sovereigns, they might be able to get a good review ... However, under normal circumstances, venerable sovereigns would not do such a thing, not to mention that it would cost 100000 great Dao crystals to enter.Li Hao listened to the venerable sovereigns talk about their DAOs. After a long time, his spiritual body also flew out."I've learned a lot today from listening to the DAOs of my fellow Daoists. Today, I'll briefly explain the Dao of the five elements!"Li Hao also went up. At this moment, he recalled his understanding of the five elements and some of his experiences in cultivating them. He gathered the secret technique of five birds, including the five-element domain, and began to explain his own Dao.The venerable sovereigns around them all listened quietly, and no one asked.In the beginning, he only listened to them for a while.There were too many people who knew the five elemental DAOs, and most of them were good at one or two.Moreover, most of them were similar.There were very few unique points of view.Li Hao, on the other hand, gradually went deeper and began to talk about the five-element domain. Domain was the key for all venerable sovereigns to reach the advanced level. However, in the chaos, one could only talk about domain after reaching the seventh level.Only peak rank six experts could barely touch on the concept of domain.On the other hand, Li Hao's domain, or rather, his domain, was a simplified version of a Dao domain. It was a simplified domain formed by combining divine runes, heaven's will, the power of the world, and force.Yuan Shuo was the first to create a domain.There was actually a huge gap between it and a Dao domain.However, a domain was indeed a simplified form of a Dao domain. The key lay in momentum. Momentum was a very special thing. Many Silver Moon martial masters knew it, but most cultivators outside didn 't. However, some people did, and they might not be called it that way.For example, some people knew neo martial. Force was also a kind of spirit condensed into a God. Extreme self-confidence could also give birth to Shi."However, momentum doesn't seem to be very useful to powerhouses, so most powerhouses don't care too much even if they do. However, when it comes to using potential energy to construct a domain, momentum that they didn't care about before is unbelievable!……While Li Hao was explaining force and domain, and even the structure of divine text ...Middle world Alliance City.In a Palace.The one in charge of this place was a peak sixth-ranked cultivator.At this moment, the venerable sovereign was also listening quietly.His expression changed slightly.Some of the middle and low-level venerable sovereigns might not have heard the profound meaning, but for her, a peak sixth-level universe master of the great path ... Yes, this place was guarded by a peak sixth-level universe master of the great path. The great path universe that had opened up here was also under his control.At this moment, when Li Hao explained force and domain, the Dao master's eyes kept changing.Domain!This was something that almost everyone had to master when they advanced from level six to Level Seven. The level Seven venerable sovereigns in level eight worlds might not need to master it, but everyone else needed it.Otherwise, the seventh step was a huge threshold that was very difficult to cross.For a high-level venerable sovereign, there were not many shortcuts in the domain. The main thing was to master the Dao and gradually form a domain. As for how to cultivate it, there was no complete method of cultivating the Dao domain in the entire chaos.At this moment, the rank six path master was completely mesmerized. Force?Using power to form divine text, merging divine text with heaven and earth, one text with Dao, using text to control Dao, using Dao to construct a domain ...Li Hao's words were simple, but in fact, he had broken down the structure of the entire Dao domain. To others, this was a Dao that could not be taught to outsiders, an extremely profound Dao.Li Hao had seen a lot of high-level venerable sovereigns, listened to the ninth-rank Dao, and mastered a domain a long time ago, which was something other venerable sovereigns did not have.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Advanced venerable sovereign?"At this moment, the venerable sovereign's expression changed. He had some suspicions that a high-level venerable sovereign had come.This was normal. After all, this place was within the barrier of the sixth heaven.It was normal for seventh heaven advanced venerable sovereigns to share a few words when they passed by. They had done so in the past, but even so, they would not have talked about high-level theories like the Dao domain.Even if he did, he would say it in a profound way, and not as simple and easy as Li Hao said.

Chapter 3419 Negotiation (2)
It was as if ... Anyone could condense a Dao domain.The venerable sovereign was still listening. Suddenly, the voice of the man who had imparted the Dao rang in his ears. It was unbelievable. The voice reached his ears through the illusion.The illusionary realm in the myriad Dao Pavilion was not created by her.However, as the expert in charge of this place, she was in control of this illusory realm. Under normal circumstances, even if a high-level venerable sovereign entered, it would be difficult to find out the source, because the cultivator who had constructed this illusory realm was also a high-level venerable sovereign.In many middle world Alliance cities, such illusions were constructed to provide a portion of venerable sovereigns with the avenue of communication.The Dao of illusion was actually not difficult, and there were many people who cultivated it.It was very difficult to construct such an illusion that even a venerable sovereign could not see through the other party. What was even more difficult was that the illusion itself had a strong ability to withstand the mind power of so many venerable sovereigns.But now, it had been broken through by someone."I'm sorry to bother you, fellow Daoist. I've been delighted to see a hunt in the chaos this time. It's rare to come across a platform to exchange the great Dao in the world, and I'm quite happy ... I wonder if fellow Daoist is willing to exchange a few things?"The venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed slightly.A true advanced venerable sovereign!Moreover, he might not be weak among the advanced venerable sovereigns. Otherwise, it would be difficult for an ordinary seventh-rank venerable to break through the illusion and directly locate him or even send a message.With so many thoughts in his mind, he was a little nervous.These unfamiliar high-level venerable sovereigns were actually a great threat to the sixth-rank Dao Masters. This was because the sixth-rank Dao Masters controlled the great Dao universe, which was also something that many high-level universes coveted.Whether it was to devour or to nurture Grade 7, they all needed it.There were many high-level venerable sovereigns in the outer Primal Chaos region, but there were still some restrictions. The middle world Alliance had also played a great role in preventing a large number of high-level venerable sovereigns from easily destroying and devouring a rank six world.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, the venerable sovereign thought about it again and again. He was ready to ask for help, so he replied,""It's our city's fortune that senior is able to come to the Alliance City in the middle world ... We still have to thank senior for your generous guidance and teaching of the Dao domain ..."After a few polite words, the venerable sovereign quickly said,""If senior has any advice, junior is all ears ..."He didn't reject her, but he didn't say he wanted to meet her either.It was still extremely dangerous to meet a seventh level venerable sovereign."My name is Li Hao, and I'm from the four-sided domain ..."When Li Hao introduced himself, this peak rank six venerable sovereign almost suffocated.Li Hao!The Silver Moon King!How could she not know this person?In all of the East, who would not know these people if they paid a little attention to current affairs?Her heart trembled, and she even wanted to escape. This group of people was too brutal. They had just left the four-sided region, and they had already destroyed the rank eight Gemini and almost destroyed the Samsara sect. That was the number one Overlord of the East!"I have no ill intentions!""Senior ... Senior ..."This sixth level venerable sovereign was already trembling with nervousness. Was he going to die Here today?Did the other party come for my Dao universe?Even if they asked for help now, even if other members of the Alliance came to help, but ... This group of people was extremely ferocious. Even if a few rank-7 came, would it be of any use? Her heart trembled!Li Hao continued."This time, we were traveling through the chaos and passed by this place. We happened to hear about the existence of the myriad Dao Pavilion, so we came to take a look. After entering, I have some ideas. I feel that I might have some common language with the middle world Alliance. Perhaps we can cooperate ...""Of course, please don't misunderstand, fellow Daoist. Not everyone who comes from the four-sided region is fierce and evil. Not everyone is a neo martial human King ..."The female venerable sovereign complained in her heart.These words ...The Silver Moon King's reputation might not be better than the human King 's.The human King killed Fu Sheng, but you, didn't you also kill di yang?Wasn't this malefic being in the Thunder World?Why was he here?Did he come alone or ... Did many people come?While she was thinking, Li Hao continued,"we were just passing by this time with the intention of going to the South to experience the Dao of spring and autumn. However, we've changed our minds. We're telling you this because we want to meet and talk, or perhaps talk about cooperation with the leaders of the middle world Alliance. Of course, it's not a trap, nor is it to kill and steal treasures. We have three level 8 and many Level 7 cultivators. We just don't want to cause trouble and hide our auras. We don't intend to scheme against others."The female venerable sovereign gritted her teeth so hard that she almost broke them.Three level 8 existences?Wasn't it just the two of you? Why is there another one!This ... Was this an open and honest confession or ... A threat?Three level 8 powerhouses!There were also a large number of tier 7 powerhouses. To the middle world Alliance, such a force was simply destructive!"Silver Moon King ... What do you want to talk about?""Can we talk face to face?"The Empress sighed in her heart. Was there any use in rejecting him?He was only at level six. Even if his native world was nearby and he could borrow the power of the world, the power of the great Dao, and even have some confidence in fighting with some Level Seven venerable sovereigns, fighting with a group of high level venerable sovereigns was like courting death.What was the difference between talking face to face or not?In any case, if they really wanted to kill him, there was no way out."Of course you can, senior ..."As soon as he finished speaking, the space in front of him trembled.Soon, a person appeared.The water Empress's expression changed slightly. The other party had come so quickly and so easily!Was this the Silver Moon King from the four-sided region?It was said that he was extremely young. It seemed that ... He was no more than a hundred years old?
