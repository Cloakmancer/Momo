        oment, Li Hao had no idea that those people were talking about him.
         At this moment, Li Hao was actually a little uncomfortable. He didn't dare to kill those who were too strong and those who were too weak wouldn't be of much use. He mainly killed some sunlit cultivators and some early stage three yang cultivators. He didn't even dare to rashly attack mid stage three yang cultivators in order to avoid causing too much of a commotion.
         It was good to be able to advance and retreat at the same time, but gradually, he felt a little sullen.
         He wasn't as excited as when he killed six three suns.
         The ninth-stage force seemed to be unable to be displayed due to the constraints. Even though Li Hao could barely reach the ninth stage, it was still not enough. He did not have the smooth feeling that Liu Long had when he entered the ninth stage and instantly understood force.
         Li Hao gently exhaled. This was probably what martial arts were ...
         It was impossible for him to keep on killing the weak to make himself stronger.
         "I'm almost invincible in the three yang realm ... Perhaps I'm not weaker than the Samsara King with the origin god weapon. But if this continues, it's still not enough to deal with Xuguang!"
         In the old house, Li Hao saw an early stage three yang cultivator pass by him, but he didn't attack again.
         In fact, he had heard the entire conversation between Hong Yitang and Nan Quan.
          As a silver, he could hear the communication between the two.
         It was obvious that Hong Yitang was getting impatient.
         The strong were all unruly.
         If it weren't for the fact that they wanted to obtain some military merits, they probably wouldn't be able to hold it in anymore.
         Li Hao's gaze also swept across the neighboring Street. A peak three-Suns expert had been hiding there for some time.
         He had never considered this before.
         However, at this moment, he was a little tempted.
         Killing was not the goal.
         Weakening the enemy was a good thing, but weakening the weak didn't have much meaning. On the other hand, killing some strong people would naturally make the weak tremble in fear, which was actually more effective.
         "Peak of the three suns ..."
         Up until now, Li Hao had yet to kill a true peak three-Sun Expert. There was one among the six great three suns who was at the peak of three-sun, but he was ambushed and killed by Li Hao in an instant. No one could tell how strong he was.
         The water force of the ninth-form force hadn't appeared yet. Li Hao knew where the problem lay. The ninth-form force was extremely fierce and powerful. How could the water force appear when one was fighting with their hands and feet restrained?
         "Martial uncle Hong!"
          Li Hao sent a message. When he caught the attention of the two, he said,""We've cleared out a lot of the three suns. There's not much point in continuing to kill. Sooner or later, people will sense it and scare some people away ... Let's take advantage of this now and find an opportunity to attack together. We'll kill some powerhouses and then retreat from the outer city!"  "I've wanted to say this for a long time!"
         Hong Yitang's voice came."I have a target. If he Yong doesn't want to go with me, then he can find a target himself. What do you say?"
         "I have a goal too! He's just a fellow at the peak of the three yang realm. I'll use him to test the waters first. If the effect isn't good, next time ... I'll directly play with Xuguang!"
         At this moment, Li Hao was also a little flustered.
         If the water force didn't come out, it would be stuck at the boundary between three suns and sunguang, which was actually very uncomfortable.
         Hong Yitang laughed and sent a message."That's a good thing. I can try it. As a Martial Master, it's actually very satisfying to challenge the feeling of surpassing one's limits! It's not easy for us to find an opponent, but you have a lot of opponents. The younger you are, the more you should have some drive. When you're old, you don't have any drive. It's said that the fist is afraid of the young, the old are afraid of the hands and feet, the young fight more fiercely, don't be afraid of getting injured, don't be afraid of being outmatched ... If your identity is really exposed, it's actually not a big deal, the eight great families "successor becoming a silver rank, it's very unexpected, but it's also very normal."
         He knew that Li Hao had many concerns, especially now that he had obtained a hidden identity.
         He was afraid that his identity would be exposed!
         However, this would also make the martial masters cautious and unable to show their skills. It might not be a good thing for them after a long time. It was appropriate to walk in the dark, but they still had to act when it was time to act.
         He, Hong Yitang, was usually low-key and didn't show off. But when it was really necessary, he didn't have any scruples. He attacked in the Cang mountains, entered the central region, and killed a large group of people, waiting for the sunrise to attack. Sometimes, he didn't even care if his identity was exposed or not.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. After a moment, he said,""Then wait for my command. It doesn't matter if there's a little more commotion. In fact, many people in the outer city have sensed the danger and a large number of weaklings have already retreated ..."
         ……
          After giving some instructions, Li Hao walked out of the ancient house.
         After waiting for a while, a team of Black Phoenix walked over. Li Hao naturally blended in with the team. The 10-member Black Phoenix team now had 11 members.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's armor issued a command, and the team of black Vatican began to move toward the neighboring Street.
         On the neighboring Street.
         On a roof.
         A brawny man was crouching on the ground. He was very quiet and his eyes were exceptionally calm. He was searching around. He was from Yama and was extremely powerful. He was an expert at the peak of the three suns. At this moment, he had entered the outer city with only one goal, which was to find out where the silver deity was hiding.
         The three major organizations had discovered that there was one less silver-tier powerhouse on the city wall.
         The other party had most likely entered the outer city.
         Many people had died in the outer city, and they might have been the handiwork of this silver-tier warrior. However, as someone from Yama, he was not too afraid. As long as it was not a silver-tier resurrected warrior, he had even fought with a silver-tier warrior in his normal state once before. The silver-tier warrior was not weak, and he was not necessarily stronger than him.
         Moreover, as long as he could stall for a while and inform the experts outside, someone would soon come to help him deal with the silver-tier demon.
        
         Up until now, not a single team had managed to kill a silver-tier powerhouse.
         The one who died last time was also his own.
         Could the armor of a silver-tier powerhouse be stripped off?
         If it was possible, it would be very amazing. It could even give the three suns the power of the rising sun. Now, everyone had obtained a lot of black armors, but there was not a single copper or silver armors.
         As he thought about this, he slowly moved around, observing the black Phoenix that was walking around.
         He also knew that silver could hide one's identity and transform into Black Phoenix. However, one could sometimes sense whether one was strong or not.
         As he walked on the roof, he had already discovered some clues. More and more people were dying, but he could not find them alive or dead. Perhaps the other party was hiding in the ancient house.
         Right at this moment, a group of black armored soldiers walked over from the distance.
         Xie Gang didn't notice it at first, but after a while, he took a few more glances. He frowned slightly. Did the number of Black Phoenix increase?
         After counting once, it was too many.
          11 people!
         Was it the last person from another team who joined this team, or ... Was there a silver-tier existence?
         However, at this moment, he was a little confused.
         Silver could hide one's identity, which meant that they had some intelligence. It couldn't be so obvious that no one would know if there was one more person, right?
         It was so obvious that it made him a little suspicious and uncertain.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao also saw that person. After carefully observing him, he confirmed his identity. He was an expert from Yama. This person's information was included in the information Deputy Director Zhou had given him.
         Xie Gang was at the peak of the three suns, a variant earth-type super. He was not an ordinary earth-type expert, but an expert in meteorite techniques.
         Strictly speaking, if there was a stone element, this person was a stone element expert.
         Other people's earth-type powers were earth walls and earth spikes, but this guy could summon boulders and meteorites. He was quite famous among the peak three suns and was not a native of Silver Moon. He was from another big province in the North, Chongshan province.
         This time, they were also the powerhouses gathered by the Yama.
         Previously, this person was in charge of Yama's branch in the Chongshan province. It could be said that this person's identity was similar to Yama's previous reincarnation King, but his status was not as high. This person even carried an origin divine weapon.
         As the leader of a provincial branch, even if the origin god weapon he had was not as strong as the Samsara King's wind chimes, it was still at the peak of the three yang realm, which was extremely difficult to deal with.
         "So it's him!"
         Li Hao, on the other hand, felt relieved.
         This was good.
         Even if such an expert wasn't as strong as the Samsara King, he shouldn't be too far off. It wouldn't be a bad idea to fight this fellow when they were retreating.
         He just didn't know if this person could stimulate him and make his nine refinements force show water potential.  If it didn't work ... If he wanted to show the power of water in a short time, he might really have to fight with sunguang.
         As Li Hao approached his opponent, he flashed and appeared in front of him without much hesitation.
         Xie Gang was stunned!
         Was he really a silver-ranked powerhouse?
         'Did this guy really lose his intelligence? that's why he appeared in front of me just like that. Both copper and black flames can't fly. If they leave the ground, they'll lose the support of their power.'
         The only one who could walk in the air was the silver centipede.
         Xie Gang looked around but didn't see anyone. Then, he looked at the square ... It wasn't too far away, and the experts came over very quickly.
         At this moment, he was considering whether he should call for help from powerhouses.
         After all, it was not that easy to deal with a silver.
         At that moment, the silver-tier powerhouse in front of him made some movements. Under Xie Gang's dumbfounded gaze, a storage ring appeared on the opponent's mechanical hand. The next moment, divine power stones appeared one after another, shining brightly!
         The gloss level was shockingly high!
         Li Hao picked up the divine power Stone and stuffed it into the silver armor's mouth ... In fact, he only stuffed it into the armor and didn't know how to use it at all. However, at this moment, in Xie Gang's eyes, Li Hao had eaten it, as if he were replenishing his energy.
         Xie Gang was stunned!
         Silver actually needed to eat divine power stones to maintain its operation.
         The point was ... He had eaten so many divine power stones in one bite, and they were frighteningly bright. This ... That storage ring ... How many divine power stones were there?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com That was not all. At this moment, Li Hao waved his hand, and a crack appeared on the silver armor. It looked like a pocket, and the storage ring that had just appeared was stuffed inside.
         At this moment, Xie Gang's eyes widened!
          He saw it!
         He saw dozens of storage rings inside, all stored in the pocket-like Gap. Not only that, but there were also a large number of storage rings stuffed together, densely packed!
         Xie Gang was shocked!
         This silver-tier powerhouse actually stored so many storage rings?
         Where did it come from?
         Could it be ... Someone he had killed before, or someone who had survived even before that?
         Xie Gang's heart trembled. At this moment, he was suddenly reluctant to call for help. He might have a chance of dealing with a silver that had not been revived. Even if the silver was revived before his death ... It would not be too late to call for help at that time.
         Moreover, he didn't have to kill him, so it didn't make much sense.
         He could see that with a single swipe of the silver, a crack would appear. Then ... Would he be able to break through the silver armor, even if it was just a crack? if that happened, would all of the storage rings be his?
         The most important thing was the extremely pure divine power stones. Xie Gang had cultivated to this level and his status was not low, but he had never seen a divine power Stone with such a high purity.
        
         At this moment, he was a little hesitant.
         And this was exactly what Li Hao wanted.
         He understood superpowers and martial masters too well. In other words, everyone was greedy, greedy, and greedy ...
         There were too few people who could restrain this, and even Li Hao was no exception. It was difficult for him to restrain himself, but as he experienced more, he gradually learned how to restrain himself. In the past, he would even dare to take the risk if he was given 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
         If he could get his own treasure, why would he need help from others?
         When the strong came, would you still have a share?
         This was the current superpowers and martial masters. A small number of martial masters could be restrained, but most superpowers could not control their inner greed. The rapid growth of power made their greed even stronger.
         "Show me your skills ... It's time for you to fight me, right?"
         Li Hao thought to himself and smiled. The next moment, he sent a message in the communication system."We can start now!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, the long sword in his hand slashed towards the other party!
          Xie Gang was also in a daze for a moment. He was still hesitating whether he should inform the Yama. When the Yama attacked, he punched out. Like a rock, it smashed into the armor with a bang, and even made a small dent in it.
         He was slightly stunned, then his eyes lit up!
         This silver armor ... Seemed to be able to damage it a little.
         Since that was the case, what was the point of calling anyone?
         This silver statue didn't feel too powerful.
         The next moment, Xie Gang punched again. Like a falling meteorite, a Sonic Boom was heard. Li Hao rolled and fell from the roof to the ground.
         Xie Gang was overjoyed to see this.
         This silver was nothing much!
         Xie Gang caught up to Li Hao once again. A man and an armor quickly engaged in a battle on the long Street. The sound of explosions was endless. Li Hao did not try to merge the three forces. He only relied on the 9th forging strength, the toughness of his armor, and the strength of his body and five internal organs to continuously exchange blows with his opponent!
         Without the support of the three forces, he was obviously no match for Xie Gang.
         But Li Hao didn't care.
         This was the kind of battle he wanted. He used the nine-refined force without any restraint. The long sword in his hand had even disappeared. He directly used his fists, one punch after another. The bear fighting technique of the five birds technique, the giant bear attack.
         BOOM!
         The huge fist smashed down, and the ninth refinement force continued to burst out, gushing out waves after waves of power.
         The more Xie Gang fought, the more surprised he was.
         This silver wasn't too powerful, but it was extremely agile. It didn't look like a dead puppet, but rather, it seemed to have its own intelligence.
         Meanwhile, the sounds of battle seemed to have attracted some attention.
         However, very quickly, no one paid any attention to it.
         Next door, an even more intense sound of battle erupted.
         The rumbling sounds were endless!
         Not only that, but there was also a sharp female voice,""Damn it!"
         That was an expert from the red moon. Li Hao knew who he was. Hong Yitang had mentioned before that he was Huang Yue from the red moon. It was said that he was hunting his teacher and had come here. He didn't expect to be targeted by Hong Yitang and the others.
         Xie Gang was also slightly distracted. What was going on?
         The battle next door seemed to be even more intense than his.  Silver ... Could it be that the person in front of him wasn't a silver-ranked expert?
         Or could it be that there was more than one silver-tier powerhouse who had infiltrated the outer city?
         He was still at a loss, but Li Hao was punching him again and again, faster and faster, and more and more powerful. At this moment, Li Hao was very comfortable. This man was very strong, and his defense was also good enough.
         This reminded him of when he had gone to look at the sea. The waves came one after another, each stronger than the last, and the feeling of constantly hitting the Boulder.
         ……
         At the same time.
         On the square.
         All the experts became alert and looked at the dark outer city. Some of them had cold eyes, while others frowned. What was going on?
         Encountered a silver?
         But ... There seemed to be more than one battle.
         From the fluctuations of the battle, it had even surpassed the three yang level.
         Hou Xiaochen was frowning as well. He could faintly sense some sword intent and fist intent from one of the places where the battle was taking place ...
         Southern boxing?
         Earthcover sword?
         At this moment, he could not help but think of these two people.
         But ...
         Hou Xiaochen frowned as he looked over at Lu Yue, who seemed to be quite serious, and said,"Green peacock, who is the one who entered the city? He's very strong, and I'm afraid he's not an ordinary person. Tell everyone so that everyone can be prepared!"
         Green Moon frowned and ignored him.
         At this moment, she was also surprised and overwhelmed with shock.
         She knew who had entered.
         Yellow moon!
         Just like her, she was also in the late stage of the rising light, but she was a little stronger than her. With Huang Yue's strength, even if silver was completely restored, she could still fight it. Therefore, her safety was still guaranteed.
         However, at this moment ... The situation did not seem right.
          Judging from the fluctuations and some faint shouts, Huang Yue might be at a disadvantage.
         How was that possible?
         Even if the revived silver wanted to quickly suppress Huang Yue, it would not be that easy. Huang Yue could not even make a sound at this moment, which meant that she was in trouble. She did not dare to make a sound, in case she lost her composure and was taken advantage of by the enemy!
         Beside him, LAN Yue also felt the danger and transmitted a message,""Something seems to have happened. We need to go to the rescue immediately ..."
         Huang Yue was one of the seven moons, and one of the top three.
         If anything happened to her here, she would be in big trouble!
         Green Moon no longer hesitated, and transmitted, "Let's go, enter the city!"
         After saying that, he quickly headed into the city.
         At that moment, hou Xiaochen furrowed his brows and quickly said,"Kong Jie, bring the others out of the city!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com His voice reverberated and told Kong Jie to come out quickly.
        
         He didn't really want to get involved.
         Things were a little unusual in the outer city. It was possible that the southern Fist and the earth-overturning sword had made their moves. He didn't want to have any conflict with these two people. The key was that if these two people were to make a move against Huang Yue, it meant that ... These two guys might be stronger than he had expected.
         He ordered his men to retreat. On the other side, the eyes of the Yama and the flying sky powerhouses flickered and they entered the city one after another.
         Not only that, some of the idle powerhouses in the crowd also seemed to have smelled the scent and quickly entered the city!
         Who was the one who started the battle in the city?
         A Crimson Moon expert?
         One of the July?
         Perhaps, there would be a show to watch, and at the same time, see if there were any benefits to pick up.
         ……
         At the same time.
          Hong Yitang and Nan Quan had indeed joined hands to hold Huang Yue back. Under Huang Yue's shocked gaze, Nan Quan threw one punch after another, which was countless times more powerful than Li Hao 'S. Each punch was bursting with unparalleled power!
         BOOM!
         One punch after another, he did not give Huang Yue any time to catch her breath.
         Huang Yue couldn't even make a sound because she didn't dare to. Once she let out a breath, she would be killed by this powerful guy.
         The shock in her heart could not be any greater!
         She recognized the expert who had thrown the punch, He Yong of the southern Fist!
         It was definitely him!
         Other than him, whose fist could be so overbearing and sharp?
         The north and south fists. The North fist was more powerful than the South fist, but the North fist was not like this. The North fist was full of Majesty. When it was punched, it was as if one was facing judgment and felt inferior.
         The southern Fist, on the other hand, was completely overbearing and cold. It was a different fist technique.
         She was shocked. Southern Fist ... Why was he wearing black armor?
         Kill a Black Phoenix and then impersonate him?
         That was possible.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But what about Tong Yan, the one beside him?
         Up until now, no one had been able to obtain the bronze Lance. Could it be that someone had stolen the bronze Lance and pretended to be one?
         That person didn't make much of a move. He only used one sword strike, and it left a deep bloody mark on her body. Swordsman, and it was an extremely powerful swordsman. She couldn't even guess who this swordsman was.
         One of the Seven Swords?
         Heavenly Sword?
         However, Tian Jian's sword intent didn't seem to be like that. Tian Jian's sword was indestructible, and this person's sword was also fair and peaceful. It didn't seem to be extremely sharp.
         But the more it was so, the more terrifying it was.
         The sky sword was like the southern Fist, overbearing and sharp, while this person's sword was somewhat like the northern fist, with a sense of suppression.
         Huang Yue couldn't imagine how these two people had suddenly appeared.  BOOM!
         Her head was in a mess, and she was hit by the fist of the South. She was knocked back a few meters with blood flowing out of her mouth. She didn't dare to continue retreating. Behind her, the swordsman was locking on to her.
         At this moment, Nan Quan panted slightly and smiled.
         "More people are here, let's end this quickly!"
         The next moment, his aura exploded. It was even more violent and powerful than before. In an instant, Nan Quan's aura was at least 30% stronger than before.
         BOOM!
         At this moment, it was as if there was only this pair of fists in the world.
         Outside, Hong Yitang's sword swept across. Screams were heard from all directions. In an instant, some experts who had sneaked in were killed by this sword!
         Kong Jie, who was not far away, was left behind. Her expression was extremely serious as she grabbed Mu Lin and retreated quickly. Golden spear kept looking back, and under Kong Jie's urging, he also retreated quickly.
         However, Jin Jin's expression was heavy and complicated.
         He recognized it!
         They were all old acquaintances, so who didn't know who they were?
         Earth overturning sword, Southern Fist!
         These two people ... These two people ... Were so powerful that they made his heart palpitate. At the same time, he also felt a sense of suffocation. He had thought that he had gone far among the group of people back then.
         But now ... Now that he looked at it again, maybe ... Maybe ... His heart was heavy and painful.
         The earth overturning sword, the southern Fist ... They seemed to have walked their own paths.
         And me?
         Even though the eyebrows-abrest rod might not be as powerful as him, it had left behind some rod intent inheritance in the last moment of its battle with Yuan Shuo. The will that had condensed into a rod ... Made golden spear feel like he was about to collapse!
         Back then, with hou Xiaochen's help, he had been able to break through Yuan Shuo's suppression and advance to an even deeper level. In the past few years, he had strengthened his body, his qi and blood, his divine intent ... It was as if everything was becoming stronger and more balanced. This was also what hou Xiaochen had taught him.
         But ... He realized that he seemed to have missed something. He seemed to have become mediocre, as if he had lost his soul.
         When he saw the copper spear facing him from afar, even if he couldn't see the other party's eyes, he felt that it was the silent judgment and indifference of the overlaid sword against him. How was the first spear strike of the past today?
          Jin Shan was a little dejected.
         At this moment, he was a little dazed.
         In a daze, he suddenly turned his head to look at another street.
         On the other side, a Black Phoenix was also erupting. He threw one punch after another, as if the southern Fist was reborn. However, these punches were different from the southern Fist. Each punch was stronger than the last!
         "Silver spear ..."
         As he mumbled to himself, golden spear thought of a man, silver spear Liu Hao.
         This kind of fist intent reminded him of the spear technique expert who was stronger with each spear.
         Kong Jie also looked over and was slightly surprised.
         On the other side, Li Hao threw one punch after another. He was completely immersed in the ninth-refinement force and the waves of the ocean. Each wave was stronger than the last. The blood Qi and strength in his body were all exploding wildly!
         From being suppressed by Xie Gang in the beginning to now, he was vaguely on par with Xie Gang, and even suppressed him slightly. This made Li Hao even more excited.
        
         This was the feeling!
         He had also sensed that there were experts paying attention to them, but ... Li Hao didn't want to stop.
         This was the feeling of breaking shackles!
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         Loud noises came from both sides, and in the city, the sound of air being torn quickly spread out.
         Li Hao was a little angry and wanted to roar.
         He really hated these people, they had to come and interrupt his comprehension.
         The next moment, a surge of blood Qi surged up. He still hadn't used the three forces. At this moment, he used the blood Blade technique to stimulate his spirit and blood Qi, making his fists sharper and more violent!
         "Blood saber ..."
         Xie Gang was shocked. At that moment, he also felt that something was wrong. Blood Qi was something that only a living person had!
          This person knew the blood saber art!
         He had heard of this cultivation technique before. It was the unique secret technique of the five birds sect and was said to be extremely famous during the ancient civilization period.
         Li Hao ...
         This name flashed through his mind, and in the next moment, he thought of Yuan Shuo. Yuan Shuo was skilled in the five animal technique and had fist techniques. Li Hao, on the other hand, was skilled in sword forms. The person in front of him, however, did not use a sword.
         Could it be Yuan Shuo?
         Xie Gang's heart trembled. The next moment, he let out a roar and punched out like an exploding meteorite. Not only that, but a set of khaki-colored armor appeared on his body. It was his origin divine weapon.
         With the origin god weapon, he was much stronger.
         Its defensive power was also stronger!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was extremely ferocious. He quickly closed in. With the silver armor on him, he felt that it was not inferior to this origin divine weapon.
         The two sides exchanged punches!
         One, two, three ...
         The ninth refinement force exploded continuously. Li Hao was like a mad demon. A series of loud rumbles were heard, causing his opponent's armor to shake and his internal organs to shatter. Xie Gang's fist also hit the silver-grade armor, causing Li Hao's internal organs to shake.
         Both sides were only attacking and not defending. They all understood the same principle: whoever fled first, whoever retreated first, would be the first to suffer.
         BOOM!
         Li Hao saw it. He saw the balls of light rapidly approaching. He was also furious. Like a crazed ocean, he only wanted to destroy everything in front of him.
         The ninth refinement force was the first cultivation technique that he had determined could allow him to comprehend force.
         But now, he had comprehended metal, earth, and fire, but he had not been able to comprehend the ninth-refinement force, which made Li Hao impatient!
         A ball of light was about to approach.
         Li Hao roared. At this moment, the inner strength in his body surged. One, two, three ...
         Nine streams of powerful inner strength were superimposed and instantly burst out!
         BOOM!
         With another loud bang, Xie Gang was sent flying. He spat out blood and even some pieces of his internal organs. However, Xie Gang only laughed. He had also felt the light of dawn!
         The fellow in front of him seemed to be Yuan Shuo!
         No wonder he was so powerful ...
         However, it was a pity that he was still unable to kill him. Yuan Shuo seemed to be nothing more than this.
         Just as he was thinking about this, Li Hao's eyes flickered with an ominous glint. The next moment, an even more powerful force burst out. This time, not only did the ninth refinement force burst out, but the golden sword force also instantly gathered and exploded!
         It exploded!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Like a sharp sword, Li Hao instantly appeared in front of Xie Gang. He heavily punched down like an unsheathed sword!
         BOOM!
         Another earth-shattering sound was heard. Bang! Xie Gang's eyes were filled with shock. The armor in front of him trembled. Bang! His defense was broken!
         His internal organs instantly exploded and shattered!
         Li Hao frowned slightly. With a wave of his hand, he collected the corpse and turned to look at the expert who had arrived in the distance. He recognized him. It seemed to be Xu Feng.
         Li Hao snorted coldly in his heart. He was still a little short of the ninth-refinement force. He felt that he was about to condense it into force.
         Although he could feel it now, it had been interrupted, and he didn't know when he could feel it again.
         Damn bastard!
         He didn't stop and quickly jumped over the street.
         On the other side, Nan Quan let out a roar and once again sent Huang Yue flying with a heavy punch.
         Hong Yitang, on the other hand, seemed to have been waiting for Li Hao. The moment he saw Li Hao flying over, he laughed and struck with his sword. Li Hao heard his voice.
         "If you want to see my sword ... I'll let you see it today!"  Li Hao was shocked. He hurriedly looked over. At first, he didn't feel that it was powerful. He only felt that it was majestic, but it had a mild feeling and wasn't as sharp.
         However, the next moment, his expression changed!
         This majestic sword was like the earth, encompassing everything. Huang Yue was struggling when she suddenly felt the entire world being turned upside down and her entire person being suppressed. Her eyes were filled with fear!
         Earth overturning sword!
         This was Hong Yitang's earth overturning sword!
         The majestic halran Gaia did not seem to be fast, but when it fell, Huang Yue seemed to be standing still like a fool as she watched the sword fall!
         BOOM!
         With a loud bang, the powerful defense was instantly torn apart!
         It was as if the sky had collapsed as the heavy sword came crashing down ...
         At this moment, Li Hao thought of this word.
         As for Huang Yue, she was smashed into pieces by the sword. Her eyes were still filled with confusion and shock. Wasn't the earth overturning sword already crippled?
         Why ... Was he so powerful?
         "Let's go. I've waited for a long time to show you this sword!"
         Earthcover sword's laughter resounded in Li Hao's ears. The next moment, he reached out and grabbed a storage ring."If you don't leave now, they'll come and surround you!"
         In an instant, the three of them crossed the street and disappeared.
         As for Li Hao, he still couldn't hide his shock.
         Was this the power of earth sword?
         At this moment, he suddenly felt that his earth sword force was really weak!
         Hong Yitang seemed to have waited for a long time in order to show Li Hao his sword move. Li Hao recalled what Hong Yitang had said back then. If he had time, Hong Yitang would teach Li Hao how to flip his sword. Today's sword move ... Had given Li Hao a lesson.
         At this moment, the suffocating feeling of not being able to gather the water force was swept away. That majestic sword gave him some different inspiration.
         ……
         After the three of them escaped, a group of people arrived.
         They were already very fast!
         But the moment they arrived, everything disappeared.
         Lü Yue's expression changed slightly. She looked around but could not see Huang Yue's figure. However, her expression quickly changed as she looked into the distance. There was a pile of flesh and blood that looked like mud, and it was rapidly being devoured by the earth!
         Lu Yue quickly stepped forward, and the next moment, her expression completely changed.
         "Quit!"
         Lu Yue shouted and instantly led everyone to retreat, but her face was filled with fear and shock!
         Something had happened!
         This city was not ordinary. Huang Yue had been killed, and she was killed very quickly ... Who killed her?
         ……
         On the square.
         Hou Xiaochen looked into the distance for a long time before sighing and saying, "I've underestimated this person ... A heavy sword without a sharp edge, but lifting something heavy as if it were light ... He might be the number one swordsman in the world!"
         Chief Steward Yu's expression changed slightly as he looked at him.
         "Earthcover sword."
         Hou Xiaochen said a name in a soft voice. Chief Steward Yu's expression changed slightly, finding it a bit unbelievable!
         How was that possible?
         "I know who stopped me back then!" Hou Xiaochen laughed.
          "You mean ... Twenty years ago?"
         "Right!"
         "That's impossible ..."
         ,m Chief Steward Yu said subconsciously, but hou Xiaochen only laughed, "There's no doubt about it. I didn't expect him to have achieved a breakthrough back then. It's no wonder he rejected Yuan Shuo so many times ... What a fearsome fellow!"  Chief Steward Yu was silent, but he was a little shocked.
         Didn't this mean that at that time, the earth overturning sword had already stepped into the thousand warrior realm?
         So that was how it was!
         As for hou Xiaochen, he also thought back to the coincidental meeting that had happened. He had wanted to execute some people, but had been stopped by someone. That person had said nothing, but had stopped him.
         The two of them had a battle, but they soon left ... From the looks of it, it was probably Hong Yitang!
         How interesting!
        
         Fear and uneasiness.
         As Huang Yue was killed in the blink of an eye and turned into a pile of mud, the Crimson Moon experts who knew the inside story all revealed fear in their eyes.
         It was just for a short while!
         In the end, Huang Yue, who was in the late stage of the rising light realm, died just like that. She didn't even have the time to shout out anything. This meant that the other party was extremely powerful, and even had the power to crush them.
         Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to not put up any resistance.
         At least, she would ask for help and shout out who the enemy was ... But nothing came out of it.
         Therefore, why wouldn't they be terrified?
         ……
         At this time, Li Hao's group of three quickly shuttled through the streets. Instead of returning to the city gate, they met up in a Tavern on the 2nd Street. They hid inside and didn't go out.
         In the tavern.
          Hong Yitang's bronze armor disappeared and revealed his true appearance. He took out a pot of wine and smiled, raising his eyebrows at Li Hao."A drink?"
         “……”
         Li Hao exhaled and took off his silver armor. The silver armor turned into a small button-shaped ball and hung around his neck. This was the power of the silver armor. Through the silver armor, Li Hao even knew that the Golden armor could actually be completely stored in the body and only appear when needed.
         The silver armor was slightly inferior and could not be completely restrained.
         This was because silver armor was universal, while gold armor was a General's and was the only one. If one was promoted or demoted, they would have to return the silver armor, but they didn't need the gold armor, so it would be their personal equipment.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Nan Quan was the most miserable. He could only take off the black banner and put it in his storage ring with a slightly complicated expression ... The black banner was a common item. There were too many black-armored warriors back then, so he didn't put too much effort into it. He had to keep it himself.
         The three of them sat down in the tavern, ignoring the panicked crowd outside.
         Hong Yitang poured a glass of wine for the two of them. Nan Quan didn't stand on ceremony and drank it immediately. Li Hao had never actually drunk before ... Fine, he had secretly drunk a few times, but he had never felt that wine was good.
         At this moment, he also picked up his wine glass and forced himself to take a small sip. However, this time, the feeling was a little different.
         A strong aroma of wine exploded on the tip of his tongue!
         It was a little spicy, but also a little more mellow. It was not the same feeling as the ones he drank before.
         Seeing his expression, Hong Yitang laughed and took a sip.""I sensed your attack from next door. Li Hao, I realized that you have too many thoughts!"
         "What?"  "Having too many thoughts, your Dao is not pure!"
         Hong Yitang laughed."Southern boxing is good. You can fight if you want to, and you can play dumb if you want to. But you won't suffer losses or feel aggrieved! You, on the other hand, think too much and consider too much. When you punch or use your sword, sometimes it's very straightforward, but sometimes it's hesitant and restrained. "
         When he heard this, Nan Quan originally wanted to get angry, but after thinking about it, he didn 'T. He said indifferently,""Indeed. Li Hao, compared to your master ... You're a little worse! Of course, you're too young. That's normal. However ... I do lack the courage and fearlessness of a Martial Master. No matter how many enemies you have, I dare to draw my sword and fight!"
         "Your martial Dao talent is very strong. It's not just powerful. You really have a lot of talent. I can tell from your comprehension of force. But you ... When you fight, you're very fierce, but ..."
         After a long while, he said,"not reckless enough!"
         "What?"
         Li Hao was confused.
         "This is a common problem for some scholars," Nan Quan said impatiently."They consider things more thoroughly, but you have to remember that you can't be everywhere on the battlefield! You always like to arrange things well, consider things well, and everything is well considered. You can either fight the weak with the strong, or fight the strong with the strong ... Have you ever challenged someone of a higher level? You probably haven 't, have you? This isn't a good thing ... You know that old Hong and I are just next door, but you're fighting so timidly. It's not to our liking. "
         Li Hao thought for a moment and said seriously,"yes, I did. I cut Ten Realms and killed more than 100 martial masters!"
         It was true!
         Nan Quan rolled his eyes, and Hong Yitang also laughed."Alright, you must have felt a sense of accomplishment and pleasure at that time, right?"
         Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded.
          Yes!
         "But now? Even if you killed a peak three-Sun Expert, would you feel happy?"
         Li Hao shook his head, took a sip of wine, thought for a moment, and said,""But I'm not Xuguang's match right now ..."
         "Why do you think so?"
         "You have three forces, right?" Hong Yitang frowned. You know the art of the bloody blade, and there won't be too many side effects after the outbreak, right? Your internal organs are very powerful, your body is very powerful, and you have your silver armor and that indestructible little swords...But in your current state, you still don't dare to fight against Xuguang. Do you have to surpass him in level and crush him before you dare to fight?"
         Li Hao scratched his head, unable to speak for a long time.
         Nan Quan also rolled his eyes."To be honest, you didn't use your explosive force before, but you still killed a peak three yang. It's said that you can even merge your three forces, just like Yuan Shuo. It's obvious that you can try to fight with Xu Guang. Guess, when your master broke through 100, did he fight with a warrior of the thousand?"
         Li Hao shook his head. He had no idea.
         "I've fought!"
         Hong Yitang added,"Yuan Shuo fought with some older martial masters before. There were quite a few Qian fighters back then. There weren't many Silver Moon Warriors, but there were still some in the central region. Do you think Yuan Shuo is only famous for Silver Moon?" In the central region, he actually had a valiant battle record, killing more than one Qian warrior ... Of course, that was after he had completed the five powers! In fact, some of Silver moon's martial masters had some impressive battle records, and they had all fought with Dou Qian! Silver moon's martial masters are the strongest, and it's not like they've never fought someone of a higher realm. "
        
         "That's why people only talk about how many Silver Moon martial masters Yuan Shuo has defeated. They rarely talk about this because Silver Moon martial masters are very proud. They think that the Qian master Warriors outside are not as good as Silver moon's breakthrough one hundred."
         Hong Yitang continued."At this time, you can actually find a Xuguang to fight. As long as he's not a Martial Master who has transformed, or Xuguang who has comprehended the transformation of force, you'll definitely win!"
         Li Hao looked at him with uncertainty.
         Hong Yitang sighed,'I'm invincible! Haven't you read the ancient books? No matter if it's true or not, you have to believe that you can win! "Li Hao, it's better to have no books than to believe in books. You've only been learning martial arts from Yuan Shuo for a short time. In addition, Yuan Shuo is at his lowest point, so there are many things that you haven't learned yet. You're still missing something ... It's a pity that Yuan Shuo isn't here. Otherwise, he would definitely teach you!"
         "Today, we are the only ones who will teach you some basic knowledge on Yuan Shuo's behalf."
         Nan Quan also nodded and said,"that's right!" In fact, Yuan Shuo will teach you these things, but according to the rules, you need to visit each family after you've traveled the martial world, challenge them, and learn from them. During this process, Yuan Shuo will slowly teach you how to become a qualified Silver Moon Martial Master. "
         "Every Silver Moon Martial Master has gone through this. Of course, that's in the past. Now ... Silver Moon martial masters are actually much weaker. They might not be stronger than the martial masters outside."
         The two of them sighed. Hong Yitang said emotionally,""Back then, if we wanted to climb up, we had to fight bit by bit and make a name for ourselves! It's not like you'll be invincible if you train hard at home and reach the warrior of the thousand class ... That's a joke. You have to make a name for yourself bit by bit and let everyone in the world know you!"
          "You killed six of the three suns in the battle of yinbei. When we heard the news, we all thought that the Silver Moon Martial Master had a successor. Nanquan followed him because he wanted to take care of him ..."
         At this moment, Hong Yitang didn't belittle the southern Fist anymore. Instead, he said seriously,""I'm sure that sky sword, BA Dao, and the others in the central continent will think that the Silver Moon Martial Master has found a worthy successor! Yuan Shuo's last disciple indeed had the style of a Silver Moon Martial Master! Jin Shan, su Dao, and the others will definitely come to your aid and look at you with new eyes. Be it Yu Luosha or the other older martial masters, they will all think that you have a bright future ..."
         Li Hao was slightly distracted.
         At this moment, he was in a daze. He suddenly understood why he had met these two in the Cang mountains.
         So ... They really did follow them there for her.
         It wasn't because of his identity as a descendant of the eight great families, it was because he had displayed the style of the Silver Moon Martial Master in that battle and displayed the future of the Silver Moon Martial Master. These senior martial masters all felt that Li Hao was blessed with good fortune!  So that was how it was!
         At this moment, Nan Quan also said,"there are enmity and grudges between people like us. But to be honest, seeing that Silver Moon martial arts forest is in decline and that the younger generation is unable to make it, it's not easy for a powerful character to appear ... We all want to see if this powerful character of the younger generation can go further." I'm not forcing you to fight to the death, I'm just saying that when the time is right, don't worry too much. Do you believe that even if your identity is exposed, even if hou Xiaochen stops you, at least gold spear and frenzied blade will come to save you if they can?"
         "It's not because of anything else, but because you, Li Hao, are the pride of this generation's Silver Moon martial forest. Just like your master, he killed so many people back then, why do you think he's fine? Putting aside Silver Moon, he killed master Dou Qian in the central continent, and many of Silver moon's older martial masters stood up to support him. They even fought for him, which was why Yuan Shuo was able to escape unscathed!"
         "Martial masters are selfish and cold-blooded ... But they also know one thing. An era needs a leader!"
         Nan Quan said solemnly,"why are the martial masters of our generation so strong?" There were many experts! "Back then, those who could break your master's shackles were not weaklings. Your master was a benchmark of that era. Breaking his shackles meant that one could go further ... And it was precisely because of such a leader and benchmark of this era that generations of martial masters were able to go further ... Li Hao, don't you wish to become the benchmark of this era's martial Dao?"
         He didn't hold back and directly said that they were the strongest martial masters of their generation!
         As for the credit, Yuan Shuo took 70%.
         Without Yuan Shuo, he would not have been able to break through his shackles. Even if he had become a Dou Qian, he would not have been able to reach where he was today.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com p Li Hao looked at Hong Yitang ... This one hasn't been defeated by my teacher before, and he's also very powerful!  Hong Yitang laughed,"why are you looking at me?" "Your teacher is very powerful. To be honest, when he challenged me, I wasn't confident that I could defeat him, so I chose to back down. It's not glorious to win, and it's even more embarrassing to lose. He forced me to become stronger. Otherwise ... I can't afford to lose face! I was praised by my teacher as the number one genius at that time. I entered the Qian warrior stage very early on, and compared to hou Xiaochen ... I don't know who was earlier, but both of us were very early. "
         "So, when I rejected your teacher's challenge, it was actually a form of pressure to force me to continue. Otherwise, if I, a warrior of the thousand-man squad, was defeated by your teacher, would I still have the face to live in the martial arts world?"
         Li Hao was a little surprised, but he soon felt relieved. So he had been a Qian warrior for a long time!
         The number one genius ... It was said that hou Xiaochen had advanced to the Dou Qian realm a long time ago. These people had advanced to the Dou Qian realm a long time ago and were even more powerful than their teacher. However, when faced with their teacher's pressure, the pressure from a person who had broken through 100, these people felt great pressure. It was clear how arrogant the five birds beast King was at that time.
        
         Yuan Shuo, who had fused the five Forces, was indeed terrifying.
         The two powerful martial masters were currently teaching Yuan Shuo a disciple. Originally, Yuan Shuo should be the one doing this.
         If Yuan Shuo hadn't left, Li Hao would've definitely taught him little by little. Unfortunately, Li Hao didn't have enough time to do so.
         In order to prevent Li Hao from taking the wrong path, the two martial masters hoped to guide Li Hao through their experiences.
         At this moment, Li Hao had a vague understanding of the Silver Moon martial masters ... The martial masters of the older generation. After some consideration, he said,""Martial uncles, do you mean that I ... Am sometimes too calm?"
         "Right!"
         Nan Quan laughed and said,"martial masters should be hot-blooded!" Look at the heaven-battling Army. They're dead. When they're alive, they're probably hot-blooded, with beliefs and goals in their hearts! When they truly started fighting, they would never consider their escape route! Li Hao, you're not even afraid of death, but you're afraid of this and that. What are you afraid of?"
         "So what if the whole world is my enemy?"
         "Your sword is indomitable. As for your people ... Well, it's open to discussion!"
          Nan Quan chuckled.
         Hong Yitang nodded slightly."It's good to consider the gains and losses and know when to advance and retreat." "It's not that this is inappropriate. When your master meets a strong enemy, he also knows how to run and fear. No one is not afraid, and no one is stupid enough to throw away their lives ... However, as long as you have 30% confidence in everything, you can try it. 50%, and the outcome will be even more likely. You still want to pursue 80% or 90%. This is too perfect!"
         Li Hao drank a glass of wine and fell into deep thought.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Was it?
         To be honest, he didn't feel much about it, but it seemed to be the case at this moment.
         Perhaps ... It was related to his experience.
         It hadn't been long since he became a Martial Master.
         Li Hao always liked to hide his cards in front of others, afraid that they would be exposed.
         This was also a form of vigilance that he had developed over the past year.
         Therefore, in front of others, he would be a little reserved. When he attacked, he would deliberately hold back 30% of his strength, worried that others would see through him.
         Last time, he had killed the six three suns to his heart's content because he knew that if he killed them all, there wouldn't be such a problem. But this time, he knew that there were powerhouses nearby and he couldn't kill them all. Therefore, Li Hao chose to hold back and didn't dare to be too ostentatious.
         This time, killing Xie Gang was obviously not as satisfying as killing the six three suns. In fact, it was not even as satisfying as killing Yu Xiao and Huang Jie. He still felt a little scared.  If it were Li Hao himself, he wouldn't think too much about it.
         At this moment, after being mentioned by the two of them, he had some ideas and thought about it ...
         "Don't think about how to answer every time you speak. Sometimes, be natural and brainless. No one will blame you even if you say something wrong!" A 20-year-old man has lived to be 60 or 70 years old. Yuan Shuo's teachings are really unreliable!"
         Li Hao was extremely embarrassed.
         "Alright, it's good that you know. Old Hong and I are here, so just treat everyone here as dead people. Treat them as if they can't make it out alive ... Just do whatever you want. If someone really makes it out alive ... We'll talk about it later!"
         Li Hao nodded."In other words, I'll assume that they won't be able to get out of here. So, it doesn't matter how much we'll be exposed. Dead people can't reveal secrets, right?"
         When he dealt with the three suns, he had this thought.
         "Right!"
         Hong Yitang also laughed."It's indeed difficult if you can't change quickly. Just think of it this way!" This way, you will feel much better when you punch and swing your sword. It will definitely not be the same as just now. I feel really uncomfortable when I see you practicing the ninth refinement force!"
         That feeling was the same as the feeling of being dispirited in the middle of a creation. It was so uncomfortable that he wished he could replace it with his body!
         "Why can't your ninth refinement force condense force? "It's not just because the opponent didn't give you any strength. The enemy came too fast. It's also related to your own psychological factors. Next time, find someone in the early stage of the rising light realm. Don't care about anything else and focus on fighting. You don't necessarily have to use the ninth refinement force. Even if you don't use it, you'll have some enlightenment ... I think that you'll definitely succeed!"
          In the end, Hong Yitang concluded,'do you know why I showed you my last sword move? I'm just telling you ... When you do things, when you conduct yourself, be more magnanimous! If it really didn't work, it would be the same as the southern Fist, domineering and cold! Your talent is too good, the bloodline of the eight great families is one thing, your comprehension of Shi is another, I really can't bear to see you waste your talent on the path of martial arts ..."
         The current Li Hao was so powerful, but the overbearing sword was now useless.
         As for the southern Fist, it seemed to agree with him.
         It was obvious that they didn't approve of some of Li Hao's current methods. With Li Hao's personality, if he didn't approve, then so be it ... But he had indeed started out as a martial artist halfway through his career. Now that someone was willing to guide him, he was willing to learn humbly.
         Since he wasn't an expert in this field, he would listen to the experience of these elders.
         Seeing that Li Hao didn't say anything, the two of them looked at each other and heaved a sigh of relief.
         This kid was really talented.
         He couldn't bear to watch any longer, so he had to wait for Li Hao to arrive before he attacked. Otherwise, Green Moon and the others wouldn't have had time to watch anything and would have ended the battle long ago.
         Now it seemed that this sword might not have been in vain.
        
         After saying this, Hong Yitang stopped talking about it and laughed,""After killing Huang Yue, my military points have increased by quite a bit. I have 35 military points now, which is a total of 10 military points. Old he, you have less than me now, right?"
         Nan Quan scoffed and didn't say anything. It was indeed a little less. He only had 31 points now compared to 28 points before. Although he wasn't the last one to kill Huang Yue, he had still obtained military merits. It wasn't a small amount either, a total of 3 points.
         This meant that military merits did not necessarily have to be obtained by killing people.
         As for Li Hao, he checked the data. Although he had taken off his silver armor, it was still with him, so it didn't affect his functions.
         Li Hao looked at his own ... 21 points.
         It was much less than the two of them.
         Southern Fist already had 31 points, and Hong Yitang even had 35 points. There was a huge gap between them in an instant. Killing Xie Gang only gave him two military points, the early and middle stage of the three yang realm only gave him one point, and the late and peak stages gave him two points.
         Li Hao didn't know much about this, but he just gave it to her as he saw fit.
         Li Hao didn't mention the military merits, but said,""The city is probably in chaos now. Yellow moon is dead and red Moon is probably panicking. Many supers have died. We killed twenty to thirty three suns and hundreds of solar flare ... Now that everyone has retreated, you can tell how many have died. The sneak attack won't work. "
          "Even though so many people have died, the other party is still strong ... Martial uncles, do you have any good ways to deal with them?"
         Hong Yitang shook his head."I don't have any good ideas. Just one. I'll deal with it as the situation calls for it!" To be honest, even if the heaven-battling army was defeated, so what? Could these people successfully occupy the city? Don't forget, there were even stronger existences in the city! "We haven't seen all of them at the military camp. Who knows if there are more powerful people there? those red jackals might not be weak, but they're only the supervisory troops. They might be the last to go to the battlefield ..."
         Li Hao nodded."Then I won't think too much about it. I'll just do what my martial uncles said. I'll find an opportunity. I'll find an early stage rising light realm cultivator and fight him!" This time, if I can comprehend water force, it'll be considered a success, but if I'm lucky and even wood force succeeds, then there's nothing else to say ..."
         "It's a pity we don't know how to use the Willow silk sword!"Nan Quan said regretfully.
         Li Hao was stunned. What did he mean?
         "Don't you know about the catkin sword? That's normal, it was lost. This sword technique is actually suitable for comprehending wood force, but it doesn't mean that it's definitely wood force. Different people have different comprehensions, but it will still give you some comprehension of wood force. "
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat.
         "What?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I know the catkin sword. Shishu he, can I really comprehend wood force with this?"
         Nan Quan didn't say anything. He just looked at Hong Yitang, as if saying,"zhenhou, this guy is not only talented, but also lucky."  These eight great families "successors, sure enough, had lived until now and still hadn't died, their luck was really first-class.
         Hong Yitang didn't say anything else. He stood up and said,""Alright, it's good that you know how to do it. Do as you see fit. We won't participate in the specific training in case Yuan Shuo says we're teaching randomly. We're just giving you some advice. After all, we're not your master."
         "Let's go back," he said with a smile."There's no point in ambushing now. Next, you'll have a different feeling when you charge with the Army a few times. In the past, martial masters also liked to join the army and fight with the Army. This was how they broke through a hundred and a thousand. Otherwise, where would you find so many people to fight with? You can slowly train, there are many things you need to learn, not just strength, but also other things!"
         Li Hao hurriedly nodded.
         "Having an old man at home is like having a treasure. The two martial uncles are really kind!" He sighed.
         “……”
         The two of them were too lazy to pay attention to him. They didn't like what he said.
         You're the one who's old!
         We martial masters don't recognize our age.
          Li Hao said,"it's uncle-master Nanquan's words. Just say whatever you want. It's fine even if you're brainless. Uncle-Masters, you won't mind, right?"
         “……”
         Nanquan rolled his eyes and ignored him. He put on his black cloak and said,""Kid, don't be too proud! I've been in the royal family for many years, so I know more than you. The royal family also values martial arts. "Some of the princes and princesses in the royal family aren't weak either. They have the best teachers, the best resources, and the teachers aren't just one or two, but a team. Some of the princes and princesses are extremely powerful!"
         "Even I don't dare to say that I'll definitely win!"
         "The royal family has been very low-key. Ever since they were forced to abdicate by the nine divisions, they have been holding back and haven't made a move. However, they have been accumulating strength."
         "Also, don't underestimate Jiusi!"
         He put on his black armor and smiled."The nine divisions can force the powerful imperial family to abdicate. What do you think they rely on?" By righteousness? By feelings? That's all bullshit, it's all about strength! As early as 80 years ago, Jiusi had been quite powerful, but what it had shown today was just a drop in the ocean ... Did they really think that Jiusi ruled the dynasty with scholars? Hou Xiaochen and the others have been hiding for so many years. Do they dare to fight back?"
         Li Hao also took out his silver armor and asked curiously,""Why are you all so secretive?"
         "A bunch of old guys, many of them are like us, in a situation where we can't go up or down. If he didn't make a move, he could only be beaten up and act like a grandson. Second, the nine divisions, the three major organizations, and the royal family probably all know some secrets. In fact, I know some as well, but it's meaningless for me to not tell you. "
        
         Then don't say it!
         Li Hao was speechless and did not ask.
         Previously, Deputy Director Zhou had also acted as if he had many secrets and Li Hao didn't want to ask.
         It was still the same now.
         You don't have to say it!
         Hong Yitang, on the other hand, was chuckling and didn't care about this at all. He opened the door and walked out, closing the door behind him. As he walked into the inner city, he said,""Don't listen to his nonsense. There are actually other main reasons. It involves some of the conflicts between the nine divisions and the royal family, as well as the conflicts with the surrounding provinces. It's actually a reshuffling process. Many people want to eliminate the others...And even want to push out a real human King!"
         "The People's hearts are not United, the People's hearts are not strong. Some people are just doing this on purpose, creating Wars and drawbacks, making the people accept some suffering, and at the same time, hiding themselves and showing weakness to the opponent, hoping to obtain the final victory and become the only Overlord of this dynasty! Today, the nine divisions, the imperial family, and the province are actually the three major forces. The three major organizations are only able to survive smoothly with the help of some ambitious people. Otherwise, do you think it would be so easy to establish a foothold in the early stages?"
         Human King?
         "Human King?" Li Hao laughed.
         "Yes,"
          "Are you thinking too much?"
         Li Hao laughed."I know that the ancient civilization had a human King. He was extremely terrifying. Can such an existence be born now?"
         "The present may not be inferior to the past. We'll take it one step at a time. Li Hao, don't think that modern people are weak just because you've seen too much of the power of the ancient people. Don't think that way. Everything is unknown!"
         Hong Yitang said again,"if that's what you think, then don't practice martial arts. Don't surpass it. Don't seek Dao. You're already certain that the ancient people are stronger than you. You can't surpass them. The ancient civilization has been destroyed. What's the point of cultivating? Everyone will die. If you die now, you will die. If you die in the future, you will die. Why are you still searching for Dao? What's wrong with your teacher, why must he find the profound spirit martial path?"
         "The ancient people are indeed strong. I can't deny that we are still learning to walk compared to today. However, you must know that superpowers alone have developed for 20 years. There may be people who have surpassed the ancient people now. If they can't surpass the ancient people in 20 years, what about 30 years, 40 years ... Or even a hundred years, two hundred years?"
         "If the goal of the people of today isn't to surpass the people of the past ... Then there's not much value in their existence!"
         Li Hao instantly stopped and looked at Hong Yitang.
         Hong Yitang didn't stop."Your teacher isn't here. Otherwise ... I'll give you a slap!" Believe it or not, in Yuan Shuo's heart, he is more powerful than the ancients and will surpass them sooner or later. Otherwise, why would he modify the five birds technique? Do you think that the five birds technique he dug up is incomplete? No, it had to be complete. He just felt that he could create an even stronger one! Learning from the ancient people, extracting their essence and removing their dregs, imitating them first, then leveling them up, and finally surpassing them ... This is the path of today's people!"
         Li Hao nodded solemnly.
         That's right, in his heart, the present was not as good as the past. He had seen an even stronger existence, he had seen the sword of his ancestor, he had seen the venerable sovereign who wrote the heaven battling script, he had seen the existence that might be the human King, he had seen the unparalleled slaughter ...
         That was why he had always felt that the people of today were weak, but ... Were the descendants really unable to surpass them?
         He thought of his teacher.
         Hong Yitang said that his teacher would give him a slap ... Would he?
         Perhaps!  He recalled the day when his teacher saw the sword Qi pierce through his palm. He couldn't quite remember his teacher's reaction, but he could vaguely remember it. It was fear, panic ... And then excitement!
         It was excitement!
         It was a feeling of "I knew there was a stronger existence and a stronger path." It was so exciting that she didn't even want Li Hao to heal her. Instead, she kept the bloody hole until it healed itself.
         At this moment, Li Hao deeply felt that he was not as good as his teacher.
         Of course, in the next moment, he pulled himself together!
         Right now, he wasn't as strong as many people. Hong Yitang, Nan Quan, hou Xiaochen, who wasn't stronger than him?
         Who wasn't tougher than him?
         Who didn't think and know more than him?
         But ... I'm still young!
         My path has only just begun.
         Strictly speaking, it had only been less than three months!
         As long as he made a little progress, he would be able to surpass them one by one. Li Hao was instantly excited. Yes, I can do it too. I can surpass everyone first, then the ancients, and then the ancestors, the venerable sovereigns, and the human Kings ...
         Li Hao felt that his trip to heaven battling city had been extremely fruitful.
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was not an improvement in combat power, but a transformation in the state of mind, a maturity in the mind, a deeper understanding of martial arts, and a new position in life goals.
         At this moment, Li Hao was also constantly transforming.
         No one was born Invincible, no one was born a Saint, and no one was born perfect ... He had too many flaws, but at this moment, he was improving bit by bit.
         Li Hao, with the intention to learn, followed the two of them.
         These senior martial masters all had some shining points that were worth learning from.
         ……
         When the three silver-ranked Regiment commanders saw Li Hao again, they could vaguely sense that something was different.
         The regiment commander of the seventh Regiment looked at Li Hao in confusion.""Well done, Regiment commander li ... But why do I feel like you've changed?"
         "Learning helps me improve!"
         Li Hao's divine will fluctuated as he humbly asked,""Three Big Brothers, as a member of the heaven battling Army, should I pay attention to anything when there is a battle later?"
