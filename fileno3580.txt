“……”Pengcheng was also speechless.Li Hao didn't talk to him about this. He smiled and said,""Daoist huntian is indeed rich and generous ...""This time, the chaos race might be in some danger ..." He continued,"did Daoist huntian tell you?" Will you go to the four-sided domain?"He was just a little curious.Pengcheng's expression was complicated, but he quickly said,""I won 't! I am a huntian realm cultivator ... Why would I help long Zhan! Of course, long Zhan is an Overlord with courage ... I think that he doesn't need my help either. He can settle it himself!"Li Hao didn't ask any more questions. Everyone had their own ambitions.Pengcheng served huntian, so it was normal for him not to go.At this moment, Peng Cheng also glanced in the direction of the four-sided domain, his expression ... Even more complicated. He had actually heard from huntian that there might be a great crisis this time, and huntian had asked the same question as Li Hao.Yes, huntian also asked.Are you willing to help?He didn't know if huntian was testing him or if it was true, but he rejected it.Huntian didn't say anything.He was only here to deliver the supplies Li Hao needed.Perhaps ... He was still testing the waters?Who knows?At this moment, Peng Cheng didn't want to say more. A small world appeared in front of him and floated to Li Hao's side."Silver Moon King, please check that my mission is complete. If I'm not mistaken, I'll be leaving!"He didn't want to stay here. Li Hao had left him with a huge psychological shadow."Yes, there's no need to count."If huntian reneged on his debt and didn't pay a single cent, Li Hao couldn't do anything about it.Since it was here, there was no need to verify anything.Of course, when Li Hao suddenly thought of the human King, he wanted to laugh. Perhaps ... The human King really knew how to count. Cough, cough. He couldn't think of it that way. The human King was a good senior. He couldn't think of him as a bad person.Pengcheng, on the other hand, rode the wind and left!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly thought of something and asked,""By the way, have you been to the South 800000 years ago?""What?"Pengcheng was stunned. Eight hundred thousand years ago?How many years had it been?Why are you asking me this?"I don't remember ..."Who could still remember what happened 800000 years ago?"Oh, then it's fine! If you've been there, be careful. After all, it's not easy to make a trip. " What did that mean?Pengcheng did not understand, but he did not ask and left quickly.Li Hao only thought of spring and autumn. According to her, a kun Peng mocked her in the past. Li Hao was confused. A kun Peng soared to the sky, while a cold cicada like you might not even become an Emperor.If that was the case, a kun Peng who could walk in the chaos would mock a cicada ... It was either to provoke you on purpose, or it was too idle!If it was Pengcheng...Then he had to be careful.It seemed like Chunqiu was a vengeful person.……He was thinking about this. The next moment, Li Hao smiled again. These tyrants were still keeping their promises.At this moment, he shuttled through the void. Suddenly, a butterfly fluttered over. Li Hao's eyes flickered.Demon?Butterflies don't have long lifespans either!A butterfly demon!He seemed to be a rank eight venerable sovereign as well. Was he an expert under spring and autumn's command?The butterfly seemed to be dancing slowly, but in the blink of an eye, it appeared in front of Li Hao. At this moment, it folded its wings and turned into a beautiful girl. She looked at Li Hao with curiosity and hatred.Buzz. He died at Li Hao's hands."I am the dream butterfly of the South!""Is that venerable sovereign Dongfang Haoyue?" the big monster asked."It's me. ""I'm here on Dao master's orders to deliver the Dao crystal and Dao master's clone ..."After saying that, the young girl was a little angry.""May I ask where venerable Lord bee Ming's remains are?" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Li Hao was speechless.Where was he?In the thousands of chess pieces!"No,""No more?"Meng die seemed to have realized something and became even angrier."Everyone says that you, bright moon Supreme Emperor, are equal to all living things. Why ... Do you also see us demons as your flesh?"Li Hao was speechless. After a long while, he smiled and said,"he killed me first. It's normal for me to kill him!" I'm not a saint. If you don't mess with me, I don't care what race you are. If you mess with me, I'll kill you even if you're a human! Fellow Daoist dream butterfly, don't give what you don't want to others. Sages ... Don't exist. Even if they do, they are the sages of a race or a region, just like me. I won't ask you to treat every living being well. "Meng die was silent for a while. Without saying anything, she gave Li Hao what he wanted."Dao master, why are you willing to give her most powerful avatar to you?""Didn't fellow Daoist Spring Autumn say anything?"Li Hao laughed."No, I didn 't,""Maybe I'm young?"“……”Dream butterfly was speechless!Not asking any more questions, he turned around and was about to leave when he suddenly thought of something and said,""Too much. Daoist master said that there might be chaos in the East. In order to not trouble you, we don't need to worry about the North, and the South won't interfere with the East for the time being! I'll give everyone a quiet environment ... I hope to hear some good news!"Li Hao's eyes flickered. He didn't need to worry about the North or the South. Huntian had also quickly sent over supplies ...He suddenly thought of something and understood something.He almost couldn't react in time!So that was how it was!Is he hoping that I'll grow stronger quickly and contend against Tian Fang?But on Tian Fang's side ... Was long Zhan not enough?He frowned slightly and nodded."I understand. Thank you for your kind intentions, fellow Daoist Spring Autumn!"The butterfly quickly disappeared!Meng die did not stay any longer. Although she was still curious as to why the spring and autumn Emperor wanted to help Li Hao ... This had nothing to do with her. The order of the spring and autumn Overlord was the heavens of the South!

Chapter 3581 A Storm Is Coming (1)_6
"From the looks of it, be it huntian or Chunqiu, they all feel that ... The warring Dragon faction might not be able to resolve tianfang's problem?"From the looks of it, it might be more troublesome than expected.These two were both veteran overlords!But now, it seemed like they were not too optimistic about long Zhan.He quickly sent his clone and the great Dao crystal over. Perhaps he hoped that Li Hao would become stronger and participate in the battle to kill Tian Fang ... Or ... Deal with long Zhan?Who knows!The things from both sides had been sent, but long Zhan's didn't come. This also meant that ... Long Zhan might be short of money and shouldn't go back on his words. But since he didn't send anything now, he might want to wait for a while.Based on Li Hao's understanding of long Zhan, he was a very proud person. If he wasn't nervous, it was impossible for him to delay and not give it to him. He didn't even send a clone, which meant that ... He really needed even a bit of the clone's battle prowess!All of a sudden, Li Hao began to think.And the human King ... He wouldn't renege on his debt, right?No IOU?……When he was thinking about the human King.At this moment, the human King was not as frivolous as he usually was. At this moment, new martial seemed to be in a meeting.In the past few days, they had conquered an eighth-order world and several seventh-order worlds. Some had surrendered while others had been destroyed.At this moment, the human King was sitting on his throne, stroking the armrest. He suddenly said,""Tian Fang's return. I said before that when Tian Fang returns, new martial ... Will return to the square region!""Long Zhan drove me away ... But the four-sided domain is still my new martial's old nest ..."He looked at the crowd and said,'now, I have three choices! Help tianfang, help long Zhan, we'll fight together if we don't help either!"There was no such thing as neutrality!It did not exist!Out of his three choices, he could either fight one or all of them. He was not prepared to watch the show peacefully.Everyone seemed to have gotten used to it.Light Thearch was still not used to it. He wanted to speak, but the human King said impatiently,""Don't be a fence-sitter, those who watch the show often die the fastest! How could he allow others to sleep beside his bed? They could either join forces to fight one side or all of them! The four-sided domain is also in the East, so it's impossible for us to live in peace. Don't place your hopes on anyone with a good conscience, they're all heartless!" Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  In principle, I'm actually more inclined to long Zhan ... Although we're not of the same race, this person is actually somewhat similar to me!"The human King sighed with emotion."Besieged on all sides and filled with danger, it's very similar to the situation of my neo martial arts in the past! But looking at the future, once long Zhan gets through the difficult times, although he might not be able to match a powerhouse like Tian Fang, but ... This person is incomparably tenacious. To be honest, such a strong enemy ... Is very dangerous!""Therefore, no matter what, we have to participate in this battle and split the benefits!""The heavenspan realm has returned, and the entire world has returned. The power of great DAOs, spiritual substances, and experts ... Will all be divided!"The human King sneered,"there are no good people in the chaos!" It's hard to say who's good and who's bad, but you have to remember that those who are stronger than you want to mess with you. There's nothing wrong with this!"At this moment, the Grandmaster also nodded slightly,"what do you think?" "One against two, probably not. We must join forces. You're leaning towards long Zhan, right? At this moment, he also seems to be in a weak position. It's just that long Zhan's side has a greater grudge with Silvermoon ..."Li Hao had killed the fire Phoenix, who was his cultivation partner.Although long Zhan had quite a few Dao companions, it was impossible for such a person to not take revenge. It was just that the time had not come yet. Now that he was helping long Zhan, what would Silvermoon say?Although they were not United and were all independent, the new warrior Silver Moon was still the best Alliance. He could not create a barrier with Li Hao for the sake of warring Dragon."Li Hao ... What opinion can he have?"The human King laughed."This kid has a big heart. Don't look at how he has no goals. In fact, his casual attitude is the most serious one! This fellow wishes that he could be the only one in the chaos. As long as it is in his interest, do you think he would care?"He seemed to know Li Hao very well.In fact, that was the case. "In addition, I'm quite ambitious. I want to open the second primordial chaos! He'd tested it out once before, and perhaps ... Even a tier 9 was his trouble. His trouble was actually greater than everyone else 's! So ... He won't mind eliminating a ninth-rank power!""Then, now that Tian Fang has returned ... Do we need to join forces with him?" the Grandmaster nodded slightly."We'll do our own thing. He won't listen to me. Of course, the other way around, I won't listen to him either!"Human King smiled faintly."Everyone just do their own thing. Even if he helps Tian Fang and deals with long Zhan ... It's fine. Everyone can adapt according to the situation. If we meet, just act as if we don't know each other!"The Grandmaster nodded again."The West, South, and North. Do we need to consider them?""Not for now. I've gained something from this Dao discussion. At least, we've reached a temporary tacit understanding in a short time!""But there's a problem ... My strength is lacking, not enough!" The human King suddenly added.He said in a deep voice,"these people are very strong, even stronger than I expected!" "But my inner world has already reached its limit. It'll be very difficult to make another breakthrough ..."He looked at Zhi Zun, who was stunned for a moment. Why are you looking at me?The human King said softly,"so ... Neo martial, return it to me. I'm going to swallow neo martial. You ... Continue to be second!"“……”F * ck!,m The Grandmaster almost cursed out loud!You grandson, what do you call this human resources?Light Supreme Emperor wanted to run away. At this moment, he was scared witless.F * ck!Human King directly asked Supreme martial artist for control of neo martial arts. This ... Supreme martial artist had just been the boss for a few days and had finally strengthened neo martial, and you ... Are coming back?He really wanted to run away!At this moment, the Supreme martial artist shook his head helplessly.""I knew you would come back sooner or later ... Wait for two days, I'll leave first ... You're really ... A headache!" He said.The human King said indifferently,"I don't want it yet, but I have no other choice." Don't worry, I'll give it to you the next time there are no more enemies ...""Hehe!"The human King also shrugged his shoulders. Hehe what? hehe was really unpleasant to hear.As for the others, they looked like they were watching a show. No one participated. This time, the light Thearch was speechless. This ... Was also possible?A top-notch eighth-rank great world could be transferred to anyone who wanted to. What was a human King not afraid of a Supreme?Wouldn't there be a conflict?He was still thinking about this when he heard the Grandmaster chuckling."Fellow Daoist radiance, it's just like how you transferred the world to the void. Actually ... It doesn't matter."In other words, the human King was no different from his son.The human King understood and snorted. He sneered,""Why can't he just transfer the world to his father?"“……”The light Thearch felt helpless. 'These two ... Forget it, just pretend I didn't hear anything.'Speaking of which, I'm also a little hesitant about transferring it to my son. You two really have nothing to say.At this moment, he could feel the storm brewing!Chaos was unstable.

Chapter 3582 Recovery, Return, Three Thousand Realms!
Alliance City nine.The two avatars and 40 billion great Dao crystals were his gains this time.At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about anything else. He first filled up the small world. It would take at least ten million great Dao crystals to fill up a small world. Logically speaking, ten billion great Dao crystals would be enough to fill up a thousand worlds.In fact, it was far from enough!Due to the different attributes, the power of great DAOs would still be consumed, and even doubling it might not be enough. However, 40 billion was more or less enough to fill up all the thousand worlds.It had to be said that it was very profitable!Li Hao's 3000th world had also been completely established. The 3000th world was dominated by desire.As for the Dao of calamity of the 1000th world, Li Hao had given the core of the calamity to Black Panther. Now, the 1000th world had been modified by Li Hao to use the Samsara of life and death as the core. This was the Enlightenment he had obtained from the Samsara Emperor.Life and death, Nirvana, recovery, desire.It was the core of the great Dao of Li Hao's 3000 realms.As for the Tiger, it was the Dao spirit that controlled 3000 realms. In fact, it was also mainly composed of emotions and the five elements, with anger as its core.Once the 3000 worlds were filled, Li Hao's strength would not be much different from the previous human Kings, even if he did not surpass them. Of course, human Kings were also improving. It all depended on whether the human Kings improved faster or he improved faster.Li Hao had always been chasing after the human Emperor. He could not forget the time when the human Emperor broke through the world and ignited the glory of the square domain when he had just left the Silver Moon.The power of countless great DAOs surged into the realm.Li Hao didn't use his two clones.At this moment, he looked at his two clones and fell into deep thought. At this moment, Li Hao had an idea ... Perhaps the 4000 realms could be quite powerful with the Dao of withering and flourishing as the core!5,000 realms with the Dao of order as the core ... It was also very powerful.If that was the case, he would only need to create the other small realms for the opening of the 2000 realms. He would not need to worry about the core Dao.For these two to become overlords, they were naturally not simple.The withering of time, The Order of Chaos ... These were all extremely powerful great DAOs.More importantly, Li Hao had a good understanding of it.Perhaps ... He could open up all 5000 Dao worlds first. As for the lack of energy to fill it up, he had merged into the chaos and was absorbing a lot of energy every day.When he turned back, a Great War would break out ... Chaos would shake. As long as the time was right, he might not be lacking in energy.At that time, he might be able to quickly become an expert of 5000 realms, with Dao as the boundary ... At that time, not to mention fighting against a tier 9, at least among the tier 8, he would not be weaker than long Zhan and the others, right?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Order, withering ...These were all top-notch great DAOs.There was also long Zhan's physical body, Human King's myriad DAOs of egoism ... At this moment, he suddenly realized that he had a lot of choices. For a moment, he was in a dilemma. He couldn't make all the choices. Right, there were still the five elements ... Now that the five elements were combined into one, it was somewhat mediocre.He didn't even care too much about the Dao of Yin Yang. "My heart has grown bigger ..."Li Hao mumbled. He had seen too many experts and DAOs. All of a sudden, his heart was wild.In the past, he would have been overjoyed with any of these great DAOs. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Soon, he suppressed these thoughts and ignored them. He would do things according to his current plan. As for whether he was wrong ... He was only in the experimental stage and not in the final stage. The outer River was still the outer River.Li Hao's ultimate goal was to become the Dao himself, just like the human King.Of course, the human King had also opened up his inner world ... Li Hao didn't even want to open up his inner world, and he directly became a Dao.The great DAOs were the same, but there were some differences.Although it was difficult to absorb everyone's strengths, this was what Li Hao pursued. Since he had seen someone else's strengths, it was impossible for him not to learn. Although it was too difficult for Li Hao to be greedy and learn from someone he had seen ... Now, the outer Dao River had given him many opportunities to experiment.This River of the path ... From the very beginning, he had chosen to give it up ... Perhaps ... He could leave it to the person in the future.As for his inner self and where the energy came from ... He would think about it when the time came.One by one, the small realms were quickly filled up. At this moment, a large number of venerable sovereigns were still coming from the entire heavenly Daoist Rite. Even though they knew that Tian Fang had returned, many people did not pay much attention to it. It was all a battle between the big shots.What did it have to do with them?At this moment, the heavenly Daoist Rite was perhaps the most lively place in the entire chaos.……Deep in the chaos.Suddenly, one of the statues opened its eyes. A world seemed to appear in its eyes. In that world, countless figures appeared, and countless venerable sovereigns 'auras emerged.In the world of his eyes, the venerable sovereigns were like souls.Tian Fang's voice rang out."It's been a million years. The chaos has stabilized once again ... In the past, in order to stabilize this place, I extracted your energy, longevity, and vitality ... I've said before that it's just a temporary solution. Sooner or later, I'll revive everyone and descend into the chaos again! And now, the chaos has been stable for a million years, and its spirituality has begun to breed. The fate of the ninth rank ... Has descended once again!"At this moment, many venerable sovereigns were excited.He could be resurrected?He could return?Could he ... Reach level nine Dao vindication?A million years? that's too long. But fortunately, they were going to return!"In the past, the heaven was split into two, one inside and one outside. The revival energy was sufficient, and the power of the great Dao was also sufficient ... Now, the heaven is occupied by long Zhan of the chaos race. Long Zhan is not weak. Some people might have his figure in their memories ... A million years ago, among the group of people who caused a ruckus at the birthday banquet ... One of them was in the body of the giant dragon!"

Chapter 3583 Recovery, Return, Three Thousand Realms!
As soon as these words were spoken, some people seemed to have recalled something. Their memories were a little dazed.Li Hao and the others had reversed time and returned to the past, changing some things and adding a scene to their memories!At this moment, someone in the crowd suddenly said,""It seems ... There's also ... A time cultivator ... Who caused such a ruckus at the Dao master's birthday banquet!""That's right, Coiling Dragon. You and the others ... Know him, right?"the voice of the master of Tian Fang rang out."I know him!"In the crowd, a giant Dragon's Shadow circled.""You once traveled to my Taoist connotation and listened to my Dao ...""This person is also near Tian Fang ... Whether I can return safely this time ... Might depend on his power."At this point, Tian Fang frowned slightly.Back when Li Hao had entered tianfang universe, he had handed over the space Dao origin of his own accord. At that time, Li Hao had still been very weak. He had only needed one more step to reach the heavens!However, that day ... That person refused.How many people in the entire chaos could resist such a temptation?He had truly reached the heavens in a single step!One day, Li Hao would be able to step into the advanced level on the spot. He would not need to fight later and would soon reach level eight. Of course, level nine was very difficult. It was not a simple matter of energy.But Li Hao gave up.At the thought of this, he felt that it was a pity. If he didn't give up, the time cultivator today would be his complete subordinate, the subordinate of the tianfang realm.He thought of something again."Dao Qi is still in the chaos ... By now, he should have recovered all his strength and even improved ... These are all the help for your return!""This time, long Zhan will most likely stop us from returning ... If possible, kill long Zhan!"All the venerable sovereigns were stunned, while venerable sovereign Coiling Dragon remained silent.The dragon clan, long Zhan.A chaos race cultivator.Even though he didn't know the exact situation ... He still felt a little sad at this moment.Tian Fang didn't say much. He looked into the distance and a world appeared in his eyes. It was Tian Fang world. After a long time, he said,""Let's go. You ... Should return! Descend to Tian Fang and completely revive Tian Fang!""Yes, sir!"All the cultivator spirits responded.Among them, several grade 8 spirits were particularly eye-catching.The next moment, a dark passage appeared.""Enter!""Go!" Tian Fang master roared, and countless souls merged into it. They began to travel through the void and flew toward the endless Tian Fang. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  At the same time, Tian Fang's voice sounded,""Tribulation, this time ... I still need your help!""I know!"The Lord of disaster did not say much. A lightning giant appeared in his eyes. The lightning giant was similar to the Lord of disaster, as if it had a soul. The Lord of disaster shouted,""You have the heart of a tribulation! This time, you'll return to the primal Chaos and activate the lightning territory. Join forces with the cultivators of the tianfang realm and kill all enemies. There will be no obstacles in the East!""There!"The lightning giant looked rigid, but it still had some self-awareness. Soon, it floated up like a non-existent object and merged into the black tunnel. At this moment, the statues opened their eyes.Some of them had complicated expressions, some were sighing, and some were excited.Tian Fang was the first to return.Perhaps ... Next, he would have to return to a million years ago, when level nine was popular.But ...The current Hundun's spirituality had not recovered enough.Even after a million years, it didn't seem to have recovered successfully.However, with Tian Fang's return, everything might start over again. Someone said again,""Three generations of time, and there's still no trace of him?"Some people looked at the person who had predicted the future. The other party had said that he had seen three generations of time.The old statue in the crowd opened its eyes again."I see him ... He's getting closer and closer to us. The third-generation successor is about to appear!"p Perhaps, he would soon find out the other party's identity.And now, it was still a little illusory.Some people looked at the master of Tian Fang, the second generation. The current Li Hao was actually deeply entangled with Tian Fang, and Tian Fang had always had hope. If Li Hao hadn't reversed the past and ruined his birthday banquet, everyone thought that he might not have been willing to change.But now?The other party was so audacious that he directly reversed the past and ruined your million-thousand-year birthday banquet. Can you still tolerate it?"Oh right, it seems like ... It's almost brother tianfang's 2000000-year birthday!" Someone chuckled.He had touched a sore spot!A million years ago, it didn't seem to be a happy time.Time flew by, and it was almost two million years.You ... Do you want to do it again?Tian Fang remained silent and did not respond.Seeing that everyone seemed to be waiting for him, he slowly said,""Let's wait and see. Time ... Other than Li Hao, there's still some hope for the new martial artist King to be in charge. As for the others ... Who can be in charge?"At present, he had not seen such a seedling.Where did the so-called three generations of time come from?Besides ... Was he better than Li Hao?"Perhaps ... We can have a good talk," he said."Without our help, it's as difficult as ascending to heaven to enter grade-9 with the help of time. Now, he's only brave for a moment. Why should he be angry over this?"Master tianfang felt that Li Hao was more suitable.There was no other reason. This person was related to Tian Fang.Coiling Dragon, Huo Yan, and the others were all familiar with Li Hao. Of course, although they were only familiar with him through time and space, for someone like Li Hao, as long as he did not go too far, Tian Fang would definitely have the upper hand in this round.These people had not been able to meet Shi Guang at the very first moment and had not been able to lay down their foundations. Right now, all of them could not wait to get a replacement ... So why should he satisfy them?

Chapter 3584 Recovery, Return, Three Thousand Realms!
Even though the calamity ... Although he hated it, the calamity didn't say that he had to change people. It was because Li Hao had cultivated the Dao of calamity. No matter what, he had to admit this.Tian Fang didn't say anything else. Everything could wait.……At the same time.In the West.Huntian looked into the distance and suddenly frowned as if he sensed something. He said softly,""He's returned!"Beside him, a black shadow appeared and said in a low voice,""He's returned!"Tian Fang had returned.Huntian looked to the East again, his eyes cold. Could long Zhan be stopped?Would the three from the East, neo martial and silver Moon, participate?Who would they help if they participated?Li Hao and that long Zhan had enmity.He looked for a while and suddenly said,"let's go, to the North!" This person ... Is also somewhat related to those old fellows. The five elements are the most basic of the elemental Dao ... I wonder if he has any connection with the master of the five elements ..."No matter what, you'd better stay here!Just as he was about to get up, he suddenly stopped. He raised his eyebrows and looked to the South. There, he could vaguely feel an aura flashing and then disappearing. It seemed to be heading north.It was spring and autumn!Huntian frowned slightly and didn't say anything. Spring and autumn ... Also didn't want to be lonely?That's good!Since spring and autumn had made his move, Jin Ling was unable to do anything. He looked around, and soon, a mirror-like object appeared in his hand. Suddenly, countless worlds appeared in the mirror!Nine levels of talent!He took a look and raised his brows slightly. At this moment, in the East, there were countless worlds. In the past, they were somewhat chaotic, but now ... They seemed to be somewhat peaceful.The heavenly Daoist sect!He seemed to have realized something and said softly,""It's a pity that Li Hao doesn't want to come to the West. He set up the heavenly Daoist Rite to resolve the chaos. The existence of the Daoist Rite is actually not bad. It's a place for all venerable sovereigns to exchange their knowledge of the great Dao. If he's willing to surrender ..."He felt a little regretful.He really hoped that Li Hao would surrender to him.Even if they didn't surrender, acknowledging his great unification was still a great thing.The black shadow said in a deep voice,"kill him and seize time!" Setting up a Dao field in the time Dao River was indeed very useful! The East is the most chaotic, but now, because of the existence of the Taoist sanctum, it seems very peaceful!" The venerable sovereigns were too idle.In addition, there was no room for improvement, so they were all very irritable. They didn't dare to go out on normal days and were all sealed in their own worlds. They were almost going crazy from holding it in, so naturally, they were very irritable!However, at this moment, with the heavenly Daoist Rite, there was a platform to vent and discuss the Dao ... It was different.Of course, if the great unification of chaos was completed, it could also be done by Connecting Worlds, but ... It was not that simple.At present, Li Hao's time Dao River might be the only method, but it was also the best and simplest method.It could quickly calm the entire chaos.Huntian shook his head slightly."No, you can 'T. Will you be able to control time if you kill him?" "If I kill him, new martial will also go against me. It will only increase the number of strong enemies! And Li Hao is still a part of the hope of reaching the ninth step ... Even if he turns back time and goes back to the past, offending some people ..."Speaking of this, the black shadow hurriedly said,""Daoist master is wise!"Turning back time and returning to the past was huntian's idea.Obviously, he knew that Li Hao would offend some people in this way. Otherwise, Li Hao's identity as a time cultivator would be enough to make the level 9s support him!Even if some people were unwilling, it would be useless. But now, Li Hao had offended a lot of people. This would separate Li Hao from some level 9 powerhouses.Otherwise, Li Hao and the neo-warrior human King would become the lackeys of the ninth-rank, which would be the most dangerous.However, huntian frowned slightly.""Maybe ... You think I've won, but ... Is that really the case?"That day, Li Hao agreed without hesitation!Did that incomparably young fellow know what it meant to turn back time and return to the past? Perhaps ... He was very clear about it!His sword strike towards the chaos great Dao made huntian suddenly realize that the other party might not have not known. On the contrary, he knew that he still agreed and left. Not only did he obtain some energy support, but he even obtained the support of huntian, Chunqiu, and even long Zhan!Was everything within Li Hao's calculations?Huntian did not know.The black shadow thought that he had won and schemed against Li Hao ... But in reality, only Li Hao himself knew how it was. That seemingly gentle, young, and childish fellow who seemed to know nothing ... Was he really that childish?Did that impulsive and overbearing human King not see it at all?Although new martial and silver Moon were young, they had risen so quickly that it was not as if there were no smart people in the realm. To be able to become the king of the realm, were they really ... So childish and ignorant?All of this was uncertain.Huntian continued to look at the realms and frowned. He quickly said,""It's still chaotic, very chaotic! The chaos great Dao itself is already in chaos and has lost its spirituality. It's completely disturbed by people and can't restore its order ...""Only a great unification can give us hope. We can quickly reverse the universe and completely unite the entire chaos!""Go to the North and keep an eye on Chunqiu and the others. If the opportunity arises ... Destroy the five elements bombards!"

Chapter 3585 Recovery, Return, Three Thousand Realms!
"Then ... If spring and autumn ..." The black Shadow's heart moved."If she's dissatisfied, I'll deal with it!"Then, he looked to the East."It's not appropriate for me to make a move ... I still have to keep an eye on the surroundings. Many grade-9 cultivators left back then. It's impossible that only Tian Fang has returned. Perhaps there are others who have returned in secret. Tian Fang is only on the surface. After all, he was too famous back then!"Out of so many people, was Tian Fang the only one who had plans to return?That was impossible!There might be some Grade 9 realms hidden in the chaos, but they were usually silent and never revealed themselves.……At the same time.Li Hao was still cultivating. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and fused the Dao of chaos into them. His eyes were cold as he looked into the distance and frowned. At the far end of the extremely dark passage, there seemed to be some light flickering!Tian Fang had returned!Perhaps it would take some time. The other party's teleportation didn't seem to be that fast. However, at this moment, there were some fluctuations, which meant that they were about to return.He quickly looked in the direction of the square region. The lightning region was in the way and he could not see anything at this moment. However, he knew that the square region and the tianfang world at this moment must have changed. Long Zhan ... Are you ready?……Four regions.Tianfang world.The entire tianfang world suddenly started to shake. A majestic repulsive force pushed out countless cultivators from the cotton. The entire tianfang world started to shake and collapse.Some of the weaker cultivators were directly crushed to the point of explosion!BOOM!At this moment, long Zhan punched out, and the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. The suppressive force was broken in an instant. Countless cultivators were thrown out of the world by him.At that moment, a powerful fluctuation burst out from the rank 9 world.Vaguely, a world seemed to have emerged.He was ... Different from Tian Fang.It seemed to be the world in the sky that he had seen in the past when he reversed time.That's right, Tian Fang. There seemed to be another world in the sky, but he had never seen it in Tian Fang.At this moment, a Palace appeared.The statue seemed to suppress the entire world.The hidden second space, the Second World, began to appear on this day.Long Zhan gave a fierce cry. A Dragon's Roar reverberated throughout the world!However, at this moment, the entire world was still fluctuating violently. The power of space and countless cracks could be seen everywhere. They slashed at long Zhan's body, causing flames to appear.It was extremely powerful!Long Zhan snorted lightly, his eyes cold. What a good Tian Fang, the number one expert of the past, a peerless Overlord. As expected, he couldn't be underestimated. The other party actually left behind a large formation, completely sealing off the world above the heavens of the past.   Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Now, the energy in this world was unbelievably rich, and the power of great DAOs was also extremely rich.A million years of accumulation!They were all in this realm in the sky.The power of the great path even turned solid. Mountains appeared above the palace, and the power of the great path had reached an incredible level."Hmph!"Long Zhan snorted coldly. This was only the clearing of the area before the recovery. As expected, Tian Fang's recovery was far grander than imagined, directly starting to clear the area. In the past, a group of people still wanted to easily seize Tian Fang ... Wishful thinking!At this moment, even he could feel an extremely strong pressure. An ordinary tier 7 would probably be cut to death here.The space Dao master!Back then, everyone swarming into tianfang universe ... Was just a joke.Long Zhan also sighed. At that time, if it had erupted with such destructive power, Li Hao's group might have been killed long ago. Unfortunately, at that time, no one knew how to revive it, and everyone fought to come ...As he was thinking, a venerable sovereign suddenly screamed from the human world in the distance.The universe of the great path began to shake."Ah!" Someone screamed. Suddenly, a seventh rank venerable sovereign rose into the air and screamed. The entire world began to wither. In the great Dao universe, a star suddenly shone, devouring all the power of the great Dao and sending it to the sky!At this moment, long Zhan shouted," I've already told you to send away the Heavenly Star you've been nurturing, and you still dare to keep it for yourself?""Tianfang is about to recover," he roared."Perhaps ... The level nine is about to return. Those of you who have the stars of tianfang's great Dao, quickly abandon them!"This group of people still dared to keep it for themselves! Did he really think it was something good?It was really good stuff. Li Hao didn't want it?At this moment, a level Seven world was instantly sucked dry, and countless great DAOs poured into the sky universe. This scene made the surrounding experts, who were looking forward to it, turn pale!The seventh level venerable sovereign whose great path universe had been devoured screamed in pain,""Bright moon ... Silver Moon King ... You've misunderstood me!"Damn it!On that day, Silver Moon King Li Hao gave a large number of great path stars to the experts in the square region. Some of the experts later handed them over to long Zhan, but some people were reluctant and wanted to keep them for themselves ...In the end ... This was the outcome.The great Dao universe started to wither. The entire world was withering, and the source of life was being destroyed.This was a level 7 world!In the four-sided domain, he was a top existence.However, at this moment, he was powerless to resist the devouring of a star.Some experts couldn't believe it and shouted with fear,""Dragon Master ... Why is this happening?"Long Zhan sneered,"do you all think that Tian Fang is a good person? The child of wealth? Let you take away the stars of the great path at will? Since Tian Fang has recovered, the more energy there is, the better. Since that's the case ... Why don't I borrow some of your energy?"

Chapter 3586 Recovery, Return, Three Thousand Realms!
The group of people turned pale!"Even if Li Hao doesn't give it to you, you'll get it yourself sooner or later. It just so happens that you can weaken the square region's strength and make preparations for Tian Fang's return to quickly unify the square region!"Even without Li Hao, such a thing would still have happened.Before Tian Fang returned, he would definitely get rid of all the thorns in the four-sided domain!This was an Overlord force.All the arrangements had been planned for countless years.He would absorb the power of the world and the power of great DAOs to strengthen the heaven. The moment he returned, he would be the Overlord of the world!At the same time, not far away, Feng Yan groaned.Suddenly, the dragon world appeared. At this moment, countless stars flickered in the dragon world, madly extracting the power of the dragon world.Feng Yan instantly panicked!He turned into a fire Phoenix and instantly charged at long Zhan. He was a little anxious because ... The dragon world also nurtured a large number of heavenly stars. At this moment, the dragon world was going to be finished!While long Zhan did not seem to be in a hurry."Father ..."Feng Yan was extremely anxious and quickly rushed over. His face was pale and he turned into a young girl. He was about to speak impatiently when long Zhan waved his hand and transmitted a message,""Don't worry about it. Let him absorb it, mainly to nourish the Coiling Dragon Star!"Coiling Dragon?Feng Yan was startled.The tianfang dragon race?But ... But that person was Tian Fang's dragon race's Supreme Emperor and the Dragon envoy from back then. When he was in Tian Fang, he had many Dragons under his command. Long Zhan ... Was it related to the Coiling Dragon?Feng Yan didn't know.A million years ago, when Coiling Dragon and the others disappeared, it was unknown if long Zhan was born. Even if he was, he was very weak ...Feng Yan didn't understand, but at this moment, he could only follow his orders.Long Zhan was still silent and did not say anything. He just silently retreated from Tian Fang and did not forcefully resist that powerful spatial destructive power that erupted in an instant.At this moment, Tian Fang had started to seal itself.The rank 9 world was self-sealing.This was the scene of tianfang's recovery.You can't see anything, yet you want to destroy it?As expected, how could a grade-9 like Tian Fang have such a big loophole and loophole for you to exploit? those who wanted to take advantage of the situation would have their leeks cut off!Just like those who nurtured the stars of the great path ... At this moment, countless people had paid a heavy price.Long Zhan looked, looked into the distance, and said in a deep voice,""In at most a month, tianfang will completely recover and all the experts will return!"He looked around and saw venerable sovereigns everywhere.He shouted,"Tian Fang has returned. The four sides can not have two lords!" In this battle ... We can only win!""This battle is unavoidable!"Even though some of the beasts of primordial chaos were puzzled as to why they couldn't run away, as the four-sided domain wasn't that rich, at this moment ... All of them began to roar. It was fine if they didn't understand, but it was fine as long as the Dragon Lord did.And long Zhan ... Naturally could not escape.Where to?If they gave up the square domain, there would be no place for the chaos race!He then looked at the lightning domain around him. At that moment, the lightning domain seemed to be rippling, and waves of incredibly powerful lightning power started to form. It had been calm before, and even venerable sovereigns had been able to pass through. There was even hope for him to become a first level venerable sovereign.However, today ... BOOM!Countless Thunderbolts erupted. At this moment, even advanced venerable sovereigns were in danger of being struck to death at any time. Clear the area!These experts seemed to be clearing the area when they returned.At this moment, the countless lightning pillars seemed to be gradually giving off some thoughts, as if ... They were coming to life.Long Zhan frowned slightly.Thunder region!He had originally known that there might be some movement in the lightning territory this time, but ... Those giant pillars in the lightning territory, could it be ... That they were also prepared for the revival?If that was the case, it would be troublesome!Could it be that the lightning territory was also going to be completely restored?His expression instantly turned grave!A pincer attack!This time, he was in deep trouble.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 His face was gloomy. At this moment, the lightning in the lightning territory was so powerful that even Li Hao's group would have a hard time entering the square region, let alone external help. However, this lightning territory ... Actually had some life aura. Not good!……"What?"At this moment, Li Hao also looked into the distance in surprise.He instantly frowned!Lightning pillar?The lightning territory also seemed to be recovering ... He had previously fused with those lightning pillars and didn't find anything special about them. They were only the manifestations of the great Dao, but why ... Did it feel like living beings were recovering at this moment?The next moment, Li Hao's expression changed, as if he had realized something."What a good Lord of calamity!"His expression changed slightly, and the venerable sovereigns around him were awakened. Kong Ji quickly said,""What's wrong?"Li Hao's expression changed."Not good. The Lord of calamity's lightning territory. Those lightning pillars ... No, they're not lightning territories. They're ... Great Dao universes. Damn it. The lightning pillars are great Dao stars. I didn't think of it before!"What? Everyone was shocked.Li Hao said in a low voice, the Thunder territory is the universe of the great path! Those lightning pillars are All Stars of the great Dao, just like the tianfang universe. Today ... Tianfang is recovering, and the lightning territory is also recovering, completely recovering!"A free ride!The Lord of calamity wasn't as impulsive as he had thought ... He had been licking Tian Fang's boots all this time, but it might not be true. Of course, perhaps Tian Fang also knew?At this moment, the lightning pillars in the lightning territory were also changing.……Deep in the chaos.Tian Fang also suddenly frowned and looked at the Lord of calamity. The current Lord of calamity had sealed himself again.The master of tianfang only frowned slightly and took a look, but did not say anything.The other party was not his subordinate.It was just that the Thunder region was very close to Tian Fang, and everyone was familiar with each other. Moreover, because of the close distance, their relationship was not bad ... However, ninth level venerable sovereigns all had their own ideas.

Chapter 3587 Recovery, Return, Three Thousand Realms!
The Lord of calamity ... Had actually set up something in secret.He might have figured out what the lightning giant that had just left was.It was the product of the Thunder region's monarchs 'fusion!This fellow is actually using my eastern wind to revive the lightning territory.I hope ... It won't cause me any trouble, otherwise ..."He glanced at the Lord of calamity and didn't say anything.At this moment, the Lord of calamity closed his eyes and sealed himself off, as if he didn't know anything.Some of the venerable sovereigns around them seemed to have sensed something. Some were silent, and some were a little strange ...What a great Tribulation!He had actually used Tian Fang's Dao to revive the lightning territory. Truly ... You can't judge a book by its cover. At this moment, reviving one step ahead of time was a great opportunity. There were a few who were much stronger than the Lord of calamity, but they still didn't revive.However, the lightning territory, along with Tian Fang, was the first to recover!"What a good plan!"Some people thought. Moreover, Tian Fang had nothing to say, because he was the one who let people in and revived the lightning territory.Moreover, both parties might need to cooperate at this moment. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ It was obviously impossible for them to fall out.Thus...The Lord of calamity had earned a lot this time.It was extremely difficult to return from this place. Even though some of the venerable sovereigns 'subordinates had not come here in the past, most of them were in a state of Nirvana.Even if he didn 't, he might be very strong now. However, there would be some unexpected surprises when he returned and recovered from this place. Here, a large number of ninth level venerable sovereigns had set up a training ground. Many venerable sovereigns might not have improved in strength, but their realms were extremely high.In fact, there was even a chance of reaching the ninth rank!If the opportunity was right, it would be easy for them to reach level nine. Before, their power of the great path had been integrated into this world and integrated with it. They were much more powerful than Li Hao's heavenly Daoist sect.In this place, outside, the fixed great DAOs were all grade-9 great DAOs!Therefore, when these people returned ... Even if they were only at Level Seven or even weaker, as long as they had enough energy, they might be able to reach level eight!As for the people who had stayed outside, most of them had been in a state of Nirvana for a million years to reduce the consumption of their lifespans. Otherwise, most of the venerable sovereigns would have died of old age in a million years before they reached level nine.It was equivalent to spending a million years in vain. However, even if he didn't have a physical body, or anything else ... He would still gain a lot.When everyone looked at the calamity again, their gazes were different.This guy ... Might not be Tian Fang's loyal Lackey.This time, he had revealed a little, but it was all worth it. At least, Tian Fang wouldn't say anything now.And that was indeed the case.Supreme Emperor Tian Fang didn't say anything.They were all level nine, so how could the lightning tribulation really be willing to be his dog ... That was too simple of a thought. He was just a little surprised. The lightning territory of the lightning tribulation ... How could it have so much energy to revive the experts of the realm of tribulation?The next moment, he seemed to have realized something and frowned slightly.Over the years, countless venerable sovereigns had died in the Thunder region, which had a lot of energy.There was a period of peace every once in a while. Every time, a large number of venerable sovereigns would enter the four-square domain for exploration. This period of peace seemed to be an accident, but ... What if it was intentional?How many venerable sovereigns had died in the Thunder region in the past million years? Where was the energy?What about the world?What about the great Dao?It seemed like they were all gone!There was also the chaos lightning tribulation. Although it rarely appeared, it always appeared. Every time a great Dao agreement was signed, a world had to be sacrificed for the chaos lightning tribulation to judge ... Where was the power of the world that was sacrificed?Just because it was rarely used did not mean that no one used it. The chaos was so huge that there were many people who used it.A million years ... The Lord of calamity seemed to have accumulated countless resources without a sound. At this moment, the Lord of calamity was still in self-isolation.It was as if everything had just been an accident.I'm just ... Helping Tian Fang.……"This is getting interesting ..."At that moment, huntian also seemed to have discovered something. His gaze changed. The lightning territory seemed to be recovering!This was very interesting.It wasn't a simple recovery, but a complete recovery, just like Tian Fang 's.The Lord of calamity ... They had fought against him before. He was an impulsive powerhouse. However, thinking about it now, he might not be so impulsive.……"The lightning territory has also been revived!"New martial.The Supreme martial artist frowned slightly."It's unexpected. I didn't expect that the Thunder region would recover in advance. It seems that the Lord of calamity has his own plans! This time, long Zhan is going to cry. Regardless of whether he has an idea or not, at the current stage, the Lord of calamity will not fall out with Tian Fang. Then long Zhan will face a double blow!"This is terrible!If it was one side, there was still some hope. Now, both rank Nine Worlds had recovered.A pincer attack!Even if the Thunder region didn't interfere, the difficulty of them entering would also increase greatly!At this moment, the human King walked out of the origin universe, followed by the big cat. He raised his brows slightly and looked into the distance. He sneered,""You're quite scheming! That's right, how can a person who created a disaster be a good person!""Ignore him. If his people interfere ... I'll make an example out of him first. Let's see if my saber is still sharp or not!"At this moment, the human King seemed to be full of confidence. He laughed and said,""In the primordial chaos, the new have the final say. The old have to leave! "Just like me, neo martial, the old man should abdicate!"Some venerable sovereigns rolled their eyes. Who was he talking about?He had been pointing at the Mulberry and scolding the locust all day long. He didn't know where he had gotten so many schemes from!The human King laughed heartily.The cat next to him also wagged its tail and looked into the distance with some anticipation ... Could they catch a lot of fish this time?Second cat, do you want to go fishing?……At this moment, Li Hao began to fill up his little realms crazily. The three thousand little realms were about to be completed.Li Hao's face was cold and solemn, and his voice spread out."Everyone, gather and wait for orders! Inform myriad incarnations. Of course, it's fine if they come or not ... This time, Silver Moon won't sit by and do nothing!"Soon, the venerable sovereigns gathered.All of them were extremely solemn.Was a war about to break out?Who are we going to deal with?At this moment, they also did not know who the target was. Tian Fang or long Zhan?Tian Fang, on the other hand, was closer to them.Long Zhan, everyone had enmity.With a boom, Li Hao didn't say anything. At this moment, the 3000 small worlds all gathered. In the 3000th world, an extremely strong desire overflowed.Everyone was in a daze for a moment. Resurrection ...What the hell?Resurrect who?Strange!

The 3,000 realms were formed.The core of the three-thousandth world, desire!An incomparably strong desire.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes were no longer calm. Instead, they were filled with a special expression.The crowd's hearts skipped a beat. At this moment, the Silver Moon martial masters seemed to see ... A different Li Hao.However, some people found it familiar.Some of the people who had been working for Li Hao suddenly seemed familiar ...That was ... The early stage of the Silver Moon, the moment when Li Hao was known as the demonic sword.He led his demon-hunting team to hunt powerhouses everywhere, seize resources, strengthen himself, strengthen his team, and fight in all directions. From then on, Li Hao didn't seem to have much desire.However, today ... Liu Long and the others who were familiar with him seemed to see the rebirth of the demonic sword!Li Hao!Desire could make people lose control, but it could also fill people with passion and motivation.At this moment, Li Hao stood up and looked around at everyone. His voice was still calm, but it couldn't hide the fluctuations in his voice."The ninth-rank is about to return. Chaos is about to erupt!""I want to split open the sky!""Someone will definitely stop me!"At this point, he suddenly laughed."There is a lightning tribulation in the chaos to punish those who break the order. However, this lightning tribulation is only created by some people for their own benefits. The so-called rules are not fair!""Even if it's fair ... It's unfair to me if it's disadvantageous to me!"At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be ... Full of selfishness, shamelessness, and cunningness.If it's disadvantageous to me, it's unfair!It's fair since it's beneficial to me!The so-called fairness is in me, not in people.Li Hao smiled."I want to do something. Something that others and the lightning tribulation think is unfair!" I was in a difficult position, but today, I saw ... I saw that the so-called master of Primal Chaos tribulation lightning, the master of tribulation lightning, was also unfair!""He's not even fair himself, so what right does he have to punish others? Who was he? Who is he?""The rules are set by the strong! It was used to punish the weak! If you want to create rules, you have to break them. It doesn't matter whether chaos is disorderly or orderly. What's important is who will create it!" "Order can exist, but order can not be established by others!"At this moment, Li Hao was like a mad demon."Order should be established by us! Primal Chaos lightning tribulations aren't anything good either. Perhaps this time, we'll have a chance to ... Kill the lightning tribulation and the Tribulation itself!""Those who bring disaster to others will definitely suffer a backlash. If no one can suffer a backlash, then I, Li Hao, will enforce the law on behalf of the heavens!"He was enforcing the law on behalf of the heavens! As soon as he said that, thousands of Thunderbolts seemed to appear in the void. Li Hao sneered.At this moment, he seemed to have an extra sense of viciousness.Desire could make people go crazy, but it could also make people more clear-headed.At this moment, he looked at the crowd and spoke again,""Therefore, the revival of the lightning territory ... Is an opportunity for me. Of course, it may be a crisis for you! This battle is only for my own personal gain ..."At this moment, the Thunder monarch, who had not spoken much, suddenly said softly,""Haoyue ... At this point, how can there still be any personal gain or public interest? who here has not received your grace? At this moment, it was meaningless to talk about this! We long for freedom. This is our goal, not a reason to be ungrateful. When the chaos was in turmoil, where was fairness and freedom? If we don't break the rules you mentioned, how can we establish ... Rules that belong to us?"He suddenly laughed."Actually, I've wanted to say this for a long time. Since we've come out, since we've become strong, since we've come to this point ... At this moment, freedom is our goal, and struggle is the process! All parties are fighting for hegemony, why can't we?"The Thunder monarch suddenly said in a deep voice,"hegemony is not for hegemony. It is for absolute freedom. Only with absolute power and strength can one have absolute freedom!""Otherwise......All these free clouds and wild cranes are all nonsense! I've been struggling in the Dragon field for 300000 years. I want freedom too, but I don't have power or authority, so ... I can only be a dog that has lost its family!""Actually, I've always wanted to say something, but I can see that you don't care about it ... So I can't say much. Since you've said it today, my meaning is ... Why should I help others? Why did he have to sit and watch? Why did he want to see others fight for hegemony? We ... Why can't we?"He pointed into the distance."We have the human race's Saint, Hong Yitang! Save the human race! We have Dao Lords of the heavens. You, spread the great Dao freely! We have a God who can save the world, and we become gods by believing in him! "We have an Emperor who is bent on integrating the civilizations, the king of Dali! We have the master of the great Dao who can control emotions, and the Dao follows the heart! We have the lightning Dao venerable Emperor who punishes the world, I! We have the Wushan that controls fate and future, we have a complete set of chess pieces, we have the three poles of the six paths of emptiness ..." Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ At this moment, the Thunder monarch seemed to have spat out all the unwillingness and dissatisfaction in his heart!"Supreme Emperor Hao Yue, Dao master, master of the great Dao, Dao master of all heavens ... Why ... Can't we create our own era?"Li Hao looked at him and didn't speak.The surrounding venerable sovereigns were silent, but their eyes ... Seemed to light up.The Thunder Emperor had been the only Lord of the human race in the Dragon field. He had struggled for 300000 years for the Thunder World. He had been depressed, angry, desperate, and unwilling ...In fact, he was not as honest and open-minded as he appeared to be.He had been suppressed for 300000 years!After avoiding life and death crisis time and time again, he followed Li Hao and even devoured the Thunder World. Did he give up the Thunder World just to pursue the so-called freedom?

No!He wanted power, status, strength, and everything! He wanted to make sure that those people would never dare to humiliate him or ban him!Ban him for 300000 years!He couldn't fight back, nor could he. But this time, he had a chance and hope, because he was following Li Hao. Li Hao, who had just risen to power, now had a place in the chaos.He couldn't say it before, because Li Hao had been too quiet.He was worried that Li Hao would be unhappy if he told him.But today, Li Hao had taken the lead. He instantly smiled and was happy. He let out everything he had."Haoyue ... Who is more suitable than you to re-establish the laws of the primordial chaos? You control time, calamity, and space. You have the power to split open the heavens, a heart of compassion, fearlessness, and courage ... Then ... Flip over the primordial chaos and reopen it!"At this moment, everyone was extremely excited.The others were fine, but at this moment, some of the Silver Moon martial masters echoed,""That's right, if we don't overthrow it, who will? Thunderlord is right ... We've all followed you since Silver Moon, and we've never suffered a big loss!""At most, we'll die with neo martial arts ... You can resurrect us!""If the rules are overruled, can't you resurrect whoever you want to?""That's right!"At this moment, the few hot-tempered Southern Fist members all spoke up.Each and every one of them wished for the world to be in chaos!Li Hao laughed,'in the past, I would've tried to persuade him ... But today, I don't think there's anything wrong with it! In this era, one's fists were the most important! Whoever had the bigger fist had the final say! I don't have many desires. Power, status, they're all secondary ... But no one can stop me from doing what I want!"What power and status?What were those!I will do what I want to do. No one can make me do it, but no one can stop me.The Lord of calamity's Primal Chaos lightning tribulation had already interfered with him many times.It wasn't just once or twice, but many times.This time, he had actually recovered. The Thunder region's experts had recovered, but what about the Lord of calamity?Would he return?This old man is not a good person. He keeps finding fault with me. Does he really think I have a good temper? p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao had complicated feelings about Tian Fang.He didn't have such a deep hatred, but it was complicated because someone had helped him in Tian Fang. This was a fact that couldn't be denied.But as for tribulations ... F * ck you!What right do you have to target me?What right do you have to make the Laws of Chaos?You don't even follow the rules, yet you want to punish others. What a joke."Thunderlord is right, and everyone is right too ...""Of course!" Li Hao laughed."Silver moon's side isn't too strong, but we're all growing very quickly! Not only will neo martial arts do this, but we will also do this!""This time ... I hope that a large number of powerhouses will be born ... This time ... I'll risk my life!" The moment he said that, the group of people became excited.He didn't care about his life!He wasn't referring to anyone else, but ... His own faction!"You mean ... We can go all out and fight," Nan Quan suddenly grinned."Even if we die in battle, it doesn't matter anymore, right?""Right!"Nan Quan suddenly laughed," I've always been afraid of death. If I die, I'll create pressure and burden for you. All these years, we've been having a hard time. We've been holding it in for fear that we'll make you uncomfortable and embarrassed ...""We're not afraid of death. We've lived long enough from the Silver Moon and martial masters! If I wasn't afraid that you'd be worried and uncomfortable ... I would've gone out to have fun a long time ago. Why would I stay here and suffer?"Southern Fist seemed to be venting his anger. He was sullen.He wasn't like Heaven's Fate and the others.Silver Moon martial masters loved to take risks. However, ever since they left Silver Moon, they kept a low profile in order not to cause trouble for Li Hao. They were afraid of death, but not because they were afraid of death ...It was because he was worried that Li Hao would resurrect them and think of a way to do so. He felt sad. He seemed to have nothing to worry about. What would he do if everyone died?Now, the words "regardless of life and death" made him excited.I'm not afraid of death!At most, he would just die.He had lived long enough.At this moment, Southern Fist was excited, and the other Silver Moon martial masters also revealed smiles. They didn't care about their lives!Thunderlord and the others were also a little excited.Even Wu Shan, who had always wanted freedom ... Shrugged his shoulders and said nothing.That's right!Without status, strength, or backing, where would he get his freedom?Without Li Hao's support, the world of Samsara would be enough to destroy them all when they reached the East.
