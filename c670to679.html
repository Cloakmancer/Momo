        ding farewell to Jin gun, Li Hao returned to his residence.
         The 100-man team had not been established yet, and there was nothing for him to do. According to Golden gun's plan, it would be good enough if Li Hao could establish this 100-man team before the end of the year.
         Thus, Li Hao actually had plenty of time.
         It was only the middle of September, and there were still more than three months to the end of the year.
         ……
         In the new dormitory.
         Although Li Hao had fought with the Phoenix gun, the entire building was fine, except for a few broken pieces that had been replaced.
         The house built with superpowers was still very strong.
         Li Hao walked up to the balcony on the third floor.
         He sat down cross-legged and finally had the time to think about his comprehension today.
          It was extremely fast!
         He took out the fiery phoenix spear, but it was no longer glowing and had become dim again. Perhaps the soul of the fiery phoenix was also digesting some of the benefits it had obtained from Li Hao's divine power stones.
         Knowing and understanding was one thing, but Li Hao had yet to form Shi.
         Hong Yitang said,"when you understand this feeling, then go and practice. If a hundred times doesn't work, then try a thousand or ten thousand times until you can slash out that kind of power."
         You have already learned it. You have a goal and a direction. All that's left is the process.
         The ultimate momentum was speed and explosiveness.
         Li Hao pondered for a while and didn't sit cross-legged anymore. It was best for a martial artist to do it personally. Sitting cross-legged was usually only when absorbing energy. At other times, it was best to keep his fists in hand.
         At this moment, Li Hao began to practice his swordsmanship!
         In order to reduce the commotion, Li Hao practiced the Shadowless Sword.
         Holding the small starry sky sword, Li Hao slashed again and again. At this moment, he only pursued speed, extreme speed.
         ……
         In the distance.
         From the top of the building, Jin Jin could vaguely see the figure on the balcony.
         Besides Wang Qing, there was also a young woman beside him. She didn't seem very old, probably about the same age as Li Hao.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wang Qing was also watching. After a while, he said in a sharp voice,""My Lord, why did old demon Yuan's disciple choose the path of the sword instead of the path of the five birds?"
         "Five birds Dao ..."
         At this moment, golden spear suddenly recalled Li Hao's words.
         He thought for a while and said,"in the martial Dao, there's only one that suits you. There's no fixed path." Maybe he's more skilled in the way of the sword. Just because he's skilled in the five birds technique doesn't mean that he can only use his fists ..."
         Wang Qing was not satisfied with this answer.  However, the young woman at the side said softly,""The five birds technique is just the foundation. It can also be called the five birds sword, five birds spear, saber, spear, sword, halberd, fists, palms, and legs. These are only the external forms. Whether it's martial arts or martial momentum, the core is actually the same. Whether you know a weapon or not, it's the same."
         Golden spear nodded in agreement, revealing a rare smile."Well said! "On the path of martial masters, some are good at teaching, while some are not. I'm actually not very good at it. You Yun is right, Yuan Shuo is actually better at teaching than me. He teaches according to the circumstances. Since Li Hao is willing to walk the path of the sword, then he will walk the path of the sword ..."
         Wang Qing didn't say anything else.
         He didn't ask again.
         Jin gun was very powerful, but Wang Qing sometimes felt that he was not good at explaining and describing his insights. Jin gun was very talented, but this spear expert was more suited to cultivate alone.
         From the corner of his eyes, he glanced at the woman beside him. This disciple of the Golden spear sect was talented and had a strong comprehension ability. Otherwise, he would have been crippled if he had followed the Golden spear sect.
         Just as he was thinking, the woman spoke again,""Master, what realm has he reached?"
         "Judging from his strength, he's probably at the mid-stage of 10000 enemies," Jin Shan said after some thought.
         Ten thousand enemies!
         That's right, before Yuan Shuo had introduced the concept of the accumulation of spirit, because some martial masters 'strength had already surpassed the concept of fighting Qian, in truth, without Yuan Shuo's knowledge, the martial arts world in the central regions had a unified name for this realm, which was the invincible Suan ni.
         Above the thousand warrior dimension.
         The direction of each realm was very different. Martial masters had many paths and choices, so it was difficult to describe them one by one. They could only be classified according to the level of their respective superpowers.
         Ten thousand enemies were the three suns of superpowers.
         If a thousand-man tide could rival the sunlight and the three suns, it would be able to rival ten thousand.
         One man against ten thousand.
         In the Wei Wu Army, Mu Lin was at this level. Strictly speaking, the Golden spear was also at this level, or perhaps it could be said that it was at the peak of this level, and could even match existences at the sunguang level.
         Wang Qing, the disciple of killing blade, was slightly weaker, but he had also begun to come into contact with this level.
         The woman was a little surprised."He hasn't been practicing martial arts for long. How can he be so strong? is brother Wang a match for him?"
          Obviously not.
         Wang Qing knew it, and so did Jin Jin.
         Therefore, Jin Jin Shan did not play dumb. He shook his head and said,"No! However, if it's just a spar, he'll be like the other Centurions. His strength is greater than Wang Qing 's, so he won't be unable to hold back ... It's still beneficial to spar. "
         Wang Qing also said in a deep voice,"I'm not sparring with him for any enmity. My master is still alive, so there's no enmity between us ... I just want to see how strong a disciple of the five bird King is. He's very young, so I want to see it for myself!"
         Gold spear nodded.
         "Master, then I ..." The woman was also a little moved.
         ,m "You'd better not go. "  "Be careful, he might kill you," Jin Shan warned.
         "What?"
         The woman gasped in surprise, and Jin Jin said in a deep voice,""You're a bit stronger than Wang Qing. You've just crossed the threshold of ten thousand enemies, so your will is a threat to him. The Dao of spear is also the Dao of slaughter, and his killing intent is very strong. He might be able to show mercy to Wang Qing, but he might not be able to show mercy to you. "
        
         This woman was actually an existence comparable to the three yang realm.
         More importantly, he was still very young.
         Wang Qing, on the other hand, was not surprised at all.
         Not only did Kong Youyun have a powerful teacher, but her family was also extraordinary. Her father was the boss of the inspection Office, Kong Jie. Kong Jie was also a martial arts expert back then. Otherwise, she would not have been able to sit firmly in the position of the inspection Office secretary.
         However, after Kong Jie converted to a superpower, she no longer taught martial arts, so she let her daughter learn with Jin Jin.
         This was also proof that the night patrolman and the inspection Office were one. His daughter was in the Wei Wu Army, so it was clear that the inspection Office had known about the Wei Wu Army's existence long ago and had even provided a lot of help.
         Kong Youyun didn't say anything else. Since her teacher had said so, he must have his reasons.
         Kong Youyun continued,"master, how strong are the five bird Kings now?" He defeated the eyebrows-abrest stick of the late stage of three suns ... Is he also in the late stage to the peak of Diwan?"
         "Him?"
         Jin Jin thought for a moment and said,"at least he's at his peak. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to kill the eyebrows-abrest rod!" Although the eyebrows-abrest rod was only at the late-stage of the three suns realm, its martial will had never been extinguished, and its battle prowess was extremely strong! To be able to kill the eyebrows-abrest stick, Yuan Shuo must have at least been at the peak of his combat strength!"
          "He's improving so quickly!"
         Kong Youyun sighed with emotion,"he has just stepped into the Dou Qian realm, and in the blink of an eye, he has reached another level ... He is indeed the Great Demon King of the past!"
         Golden spear did not say a word.
         Yuan Shuo's appearance appeared in his mind.
         He was unbridled and extremely arrogant. In the past, he had caught his golden spear with his bare hands. If it wasn't for the Spear's toughness, that guy would have broken it.
         After losing to Yuan Shuo, he, who was about to step into the universe crossing realm, was unable to do so. Every time he was about to step into the universe crossing realm ... He would feel extremely uncomfortable and breathless under the pressure.
         It wasn't until later, when hou Xiaochen struck out with a casual spear strike, that he broke through the demon in his heart and entered the Qian warrior realm.
         However, Jin Jin himself knew that this meant that it would be very difficult for him to surpass Yuan Shuo. As long as Yuan Shuo's path was not cut off, he would most likely be defeated if they met again!
         It was difficult to get rid of the inner demons.
         Beside him, Kong Youyun seemed to have noticed something and said softly,"Master, when I succeed in my martial arts, I'll go and challenge the five bird Kings!"
         "Forget it. The grudges of the older generation have nothing to do with you."
         p Gold spear shook his head.  A challenge was not a sparring session, nor was it a joke.
         If that really happened, Yuan Shuo would really beat her to death. This was no joke.
         Even if Yuan Shuo did not intend to kill him when he challenged him with the eyebrows-abrest rod ... At that time, he was so engrossed in the fight that he did not care about it at all. Killing his opponent was a form of respect in the eyes of these people.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He glanced at Li Hao, who was standing on the balcony in the distance, and awkwardly swung his sword again and again. Golden spear didn't feel that there was anything wrong with it.
         On the contrary, he admired this attitude.
         It was just that ... This guy was not in a hurry to recruit people, which made people a little helpless.  At this moment, Kong Youyun asked again,"master, then ... Are we still going to the remains?" Although it's not as dangerous as heaven battling city, I think we'll gain a lot if we succeed. Why don't we call second brother mu and Li Hao? maybe we'll get something. "
         Jin gun fell into deep thought.
         In the past few days, he had been exploring some ancient ruins. Although they weren't as intact as heaven battling city, which had been preserved for tens of millions of years, these new ancient ruins were still quite dangerous, and danger also represented opportunities.
         He went there three times, but he didn't find anything.
         This time, when he returned, he had the intention to call some of the Wei Wu Army's powerhouses to go with him.
         Kong Youyun continued,'isn't li Hao the disciple of the five king birds? The five beast Kings are the best at exploring ancient ruins ..."
         Golden spear thought for a while and nodded,"En, go back and inform him. Five days ... No, ten days later, have him come with me. We will be in charge of the land reclamation. If the land reclamation is successful, then we will let the Wei Wu Army in!"
         This was also the Wei Wu Army's tradition. The strong were in charge of clearing the land, and the gains were the greatest. After removing some of the greater dangers, the weak would be left to explore. There were also some dangers, but the danger would be greatly reduced.
         However, there were still some surprises.
         Sometimes, even the strong would fail to discover some danger, causing the Wei Wu Army to suffer heavy losses.
         After so many years, the Wei Wu Army couldn't always be old people. Many of them had actually died long ago. The Wei Wu Army had changed for about two or three generations, which was why it was the Wei Wu Army of today.
         ……
         Li Hao didn't know that he would receive a mission so soon.
         Li Hao was unable to free himself from the attack.
         The figure on the balcony cut through the sky from day to night.
         With his sword around, he was not afraid of the accumulation of internal injuries due to excessive cultivation. Even though Jin Shan, Mu Lin, and the others all had the same thought, that this fellow was sometimes crazy, and if this continued, it would be easy for him to sustain internal injuries.
         However, they were not familiar with each other, so no one went up to persuade him.
          ……
         The next day.
         Li Hao disappeared.
         Li Hao didn't leave the Wei Wu Army. In the forest outside the small building, Li Hao continued to play a game of pursuit with the Phoenix spear.
         A man and a spear were moving quickly in the forest.
         Li Hao was willing to spend the divine power stones when he needed to. Chief Steward Yu had only lent him the fire Phoenix spear for three days. It would be a waste if he did not use the opportunity to gain more insights with the fire Phoenix spear.
         ……
         Li Hao was cultivating, paying no attention to the outside world.
         Outside the Wei Wu Army, a group of people had already arrived.
         This time, Chief Steward Yu was still leading the team.
        
         However, at this moment, Chief Steward Yu's eyes were also in a daze.
         This morning, Hong Yitang's second wife led a group of people to find the night patrolman, who was looking for Li Hao. After asking him a few questions, Chief Steward Yu learned why Li Hao had come to find him yesterday.
         Getting sponsors ...
         They had actually managed to pull in a sponsor!
         Moreover, it was not an ordinary sponsorship.
         The swords gate had given their full support to Li Hao, even more than half of their martial disciples.
         Even though the strongest among them were only a few in the late-stage of the 100-level.
         However, for a Martial Master to cultivate to the late stage of the breakthrough of a hundred ... The key was that most of the swords gate's martial masters cultivated with their own efforts, they rarely consumed the mystic energy. Such a group of martial masters had a strong foundation.
         Although Hong Yitang was no longer a Martial Master, he still had a solid foundation in the cultivation of his disciples.
         He himself had a deep understanding of martial arts.
          If these disciples joined the Wei Wu Army, there might be a period of explosive growth.
         Chief Steward Yu also knew that the Minister was actually concerned about the swords gate.
         According to the Minister, with the rise of superpowers, the number of martial masters in Silver Moon was not as good as before. There were very few people in Silver Moon who could still persist in nurturing martial masters and allow them to learn and grow systematically.
         Some sects said that they were martial masters 'inheritances, but in reality, they were just using the name of martial masters to use supernatural means.
         Using the mysterious energy to strengthen quickly was actually a way to reach the peak of the tenth realm and change to another superpower.
         Some of the more ambitious ones also rushed to break through 100 and then changed their minds to sunlight. There were not many who still persisted in martial arts.
         Those people didn't put too much effort in teaching martial arts.
         After all, once you become a superpower and have the superpower skills, why waste time learning those useless martial arts? it's good enough to have a secret skill that can help you break through 100. This is the problem that many martial masters have now.
         Majordomo Yu didn't expect that after the department head had been thinking about it for so long, in the end ... He went to seek refuge with a newcomer like Li Hao!
         Although Li Hao was one of the night patrollers, Chief Steward Yu still couldn't figure it out.
         Could Li Hao be more worthy to rely on than the Minister?
         If Hong Yitang had gone to hou Xiaochen, he would have accepted these people, and Li Hao wouldn't have been in the way.
         ……
         In front of the Wei Wu Army.
         This time, the Golden spear came out in person.
         Knowing that these people were from the swords gate, he was surprised and surprised. They were disciples of the earth overturning sword sect.
         He glanced over and nodded slightly.
         He was a little surprised. These martial masters were in good condition judging from their posture and energy. They were not at a loss or dispirited like most martial masters today. Some martial masters were in bad condition because they were unable to convert their superpowers!
         In order to become a superpower, he had long lost his carefree and relaxed attitude.
          The hall of earth overturning sword flood was quite famous back then.  He had truly become a laughingstock because he had avoided fighting Yuan Shuo several times. At that time, the reputation of the overturning sword had already become somewhat smelly. Otherwise, among the Seven Swords back then, the heavenly Sword was undoubtedly powerful, and the overturning sword was also famous. With one sword, the heavens and earth would be overturned. Was this a joke?
         He glanced at Hong Xiu. He knew a little about the situation. Hong Xiu was Hong Yitang's eldest disciple ... Forget it, he could not be bothered to say anything now. Hong Xiu and Hong Yitang had both become superpowers. He was not even in the mood to make fun of them.
         The Golden spear only took a glance at Hong Xiu and did not look at her for long. Soon, it turned to look at Hong Qing, who was among the crowd, looking a little curious.
         His Foundation was very solid!
         The swords gate disciples were all strong, but this Hong Qing was Hong Yitang's daughter after all, and Jin gun was very strong. With just a simple glance, his eyes flickered, Hong Yitang was an interesting character!
         The other disciples, more or less, even if there were fewer mysterious uses, there were still some.
         When martial masters used the mysterious energy, their bodies would be contaminated with it.
         Even Li Hao was no exception!
         However, this Hong Qing ... Was a genuine person in the late-stage of the breakthrough 100 realm. This meant that he had never used the mysterious ability as an aid. It was very rare for someone to be able to cultivate to the late-stage of the breakthrough 100 realm at this age!
         Of course, he could not rule out the possibility that the other party had not used the mysterious energy but the divine power Stone. It would be difficult to leave any traces of the mysterious energy on the body if the divine power Stone was used.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Luo ..."
         Just as he was about to speak, Chief Steward Yu looked at him with an extremely cold gaze.
         Jin Jin was speechless.
         He was used to calling her that. Even after so many years, he still had this habit. This had happened countless times, but he was still used to calling her that.
         "Secretary Yu!"
         Golden spear still uttered the awkward-sounding name,""This is ..."
         "Swordmaster Hong and Li Hao have reached an agreement. These disciples of swords gate will join Li Hao's hundred-man squad. Besides, Swordmaster Hong has also sent the hundred Black Radiance Deputy to Li Hao's hundred-man squad ..."
         As soon as he said this, some of the martial masters who were watching from behind couldn't help but widen their eyes.
          艹!
         So generous?
         Li Hao had just arrived, and everyone only knew that he was going to become a Centurion. In the end, he hadn't even recruited enough people, and now he was giving them away, and Gu Qian?
         "What's the situation with Li Hao?"
         "Don't tell me he's become the son-in-law of the earth overturning sword?"
         "I heard that the one in front is the daughter of the earth overturning sword ... She has just joined the Wei Wu Army and doesn't have enough manpower, so she's giving people and money. Isn't she too comfortable ..."
         "Think about us. When we first came here, it was so difficult!"
         “……”
         The martial masters muttered softly.
         Some people were envious, while others sighed with emotion.
        
         The eyes of the few Centurions had turned red. Some of them had established their own 100-man teams, and they knew how difficult it had been.
         They had spent a lot of time, manpower, and resources, and some of them had even brought their own senior brothers, junior uncles, and junior nephews ...
         Some of the sects had all their people pulled away.
         For example, the successor of the mountain splitting axe. The mountain splitting lineage was now in his mountain splitting Army.
         As for Li Hao ... How could he not be envious?
         This was not all. Previously, the Wei Wu Army did not have many black phoenixes. There were more than 100 of them. It would be considered good if a 100-man team could get more than 10 of them.
         This time, he had gained a lot. He had more than 500 night watchers in total.
         It occupied almost half of the total.
         Even so, these Centurions had used all sorts of methods in order to fight for more people. However, even so, they were still unable to fully equip the team. They could only let some of the weaker members in the team wear clothes to level up the team's strength so as to prevent the gap from being too big.
         But what about Li Hao?
          There was no sign of anyone, but hei Teng was fully equipped.
         These people all knew how powerful the black banner was. Not to mention other things, its defense was really strong. If more than a hundred martial masters wore it, even the sunlight would find it hard to break through. It was simply an undying iron army!
         The group of people were filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred!
         ? Mu Lin was also speechless!
         He was really F * cking speechless.
         Did Li Hao, this pretty boy, live off a woman?
         The enmity between the earth-overturning sword and Yuan Shuo was actually quite deep. He had challenged Yuan Shuo three times, but Yuan Shuo had rejected him. This had dealt a huge blow to the reputation of the earth-overturning sword. If he cared about his reputation, he would have long been an enemy of life and death!
         Even so, they still sent over so many people and things ... Were they trying to make Li Hao their son-in-law?
         At the front of the crowd.
         The Golden spear was also a little surprised. It was not enough to give people, but also black flames?
         However, he had a lot of experience, so he didn't say anything. He just said,""Li Hao seems to be still cultivating. Don't stand at the door. Come in. I'll get someone to call him."
         "Didn't Hong Yitang come?"he asked.
         "My husband is in closed-door cultivation."
         "He's been a little restless lately,"Madam Hong said softly," he hasn't fully recovered from the injuries he sustained in heaven battling city, so he wanted to come with me to meet senior golden spear, but it's a pity ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Jin Jin Shan waved his hand,"it's fine. It's good that we don't meet." As for senior ... I dare not be called senior. When the earth overturning sword became famous, I had just left the martial arts world. In terms of age, I'm only two or three years older than him ..."
         Was it?
         You look quite old.
         Of course, these words only flashed through Hong Xiu's mind.
         On the other hand, Hong Qing looked at the Golden spear with curiosity and admiration. The Golden spear was the head of the three Spears. It was as famous as the heavenly Sword, but it was more famous than his father.
         However, her father was no longer in the martial arts world and was only a superhuman now. Hong Qing was still very regretful. She liked to hear some stories about the martial arts world.
          Her father didn't like to talk about these things, but her stepmother liked to talk to her.  Yes, so their relationship was not bad.
         Hong Yitang's wife had brought a team here, and Jin Shan had given them enough face. In addition to chief Yu's presence, the three of them quickly entered the inner hall to chat. Hong Xiu used to be one generation lower than them, but now they were of the same generation, so they could chat a little.
         As for the others, they did not have the qualifications.
         Outside the building, Hong Qing and the others could only wait for Li Hao's arrival.
         However, it wasn't as if there was no one to accompany them. Mu Lin, Kong you Yun and a few others were all there.
         In fact, they were also curious about swords gate.
         When Kong you Yun saw that her master had gone to entertain Yu Luosha and earth overturning sword's lovers, she took the initiative to say, "I'm Kong you Yun, a golden spear disciple ... You're the daughter of senior earth overturning sword?"
         Hong Qing glanced at Kong Youyun and nodded,""Hello, Senior Sister!"
         "Hello," he said.
         The two of them continued to chat while Mu Lin just listened to them. After a while, he also started to chat with a swords gate disciple who was in the late stage of breaking 100.
         Everyone was chatting.
         In the distance, a figure flashed and appeared on the ground in an instant.
         At this moment, Li Hao was drenched in sweat.
         His face was slightly flushed. He calmed his breathing and walked over. Before he even arrived, a sword aura gathered. He didn't care about the presence of Kong you Yun and Mu Lin. A sword aura rose up!
         Li Hao walked over step by step. The disciples of swords gate who were still looking around suddenly felt a heavy pressure coming down on them!
         At this moment, even Kong Youyun had stopped talking.
         Li Hao ignored her. He didn't know her, but he didn't pay much attention to her. Judging from her aura, she might be a disciple of the Golden spear sect. She didn't seem weak.
         That was all!
         His main target was the swords gate disciples, he only wanted to see the quality of these disciples.
          It was too bad and useless.
         Step by step, he approached them. When he was still about 30 meters away from them, half of the 20 ten slash realm cultivators in the team couldn't even breathe. They were forced to retreat and leave the range of the sword aura in the blink of an eye.
         Li Hao continued to move forward. Around twenty-five meters away, a few more ten slash realm cultivators retreated.
         Twenty meters. The remaining three martial masters at the peak of the tenth realm also retreated.
         At this moment, there were only 10 people who had broken through the 100-point mark, as well as Kong you and the others from the Yun wood forest.
         Li Hao's sword continued to move forward with the momentum of a mountain.
         The 10 people who had broken through 100 were all on the verge of collapsing.
         Each and every one of them was filled with shock!
         So strong?
         It was only 'momentum'. It was not like they had never seen 'momentum' before. But at this moment, they felt the tremendous pressure and the sharpness of the aura. As disciples of swords gate, they also practiced swordsmanship. But in front of Li Hao, they felt that their swords ... Were too weak!
        
         In front of him, Hong Qing gritted his teeth and looked at Li Hao. He suddenly felt like he was looking at his father.
         That's right, the earth-overturning sword was a sword that could turn the world upside down, so it naturally contained some terrain. Right now, Li Hao was also using earth sword force.
         The sword of Mount Tai!
         15 meters. The few cultivators who had broken through 100 meters retreated one after another. Each of them had a look of shock and unwillingness on their faces.
         At 10 meters, a few more people who had broken through 100 points retreated. Some even had blood oozing out of their mouths, full of unwillingness.
         At this moment, only Hong Qing was left.
         Hong Qing was not the only one who had broken through the late-stage 100 realm. However, he was the only one who could stand still and not retreat.
         Hong Qing gritted his teeth and was about to fight to the end when Li Hao suddenly withdrew his sword.
         Hong Qing staggered and almost fell.
         Kong Youyun, who was beside him, helped him up. She looked at Li Hao with a strange expression and said softly,""Centurion li, why don't you continue?"
          Li Hao looked at her in surprise and explained,""I'm just testing their level, not killing them. Since I've already tested them, there's no need to try again."
         "Li Hao!" He cupped his fists.
         Kong Youyun, on the other hand, was not used to cupping her fists. She only nodded slightly,"Kong you Yun, golden spear disciple."
         "I've long heard about you!"
         Li Hao said politely. He looked away from her and turned to Hong Qing, smiling."Your Foundation is really solid. Even those of the tenth realm have a solid foundation! I absorbed a large amount of mysterious energy before and stepped into slash ten. When my teacher and Minister Liu Long had a Dual Force confrontation, I felt that he was not as good as I am now. I can't move even when I'm far away. "
         As soon as he said that, the disciples of swords gate were all overjoyed.
         To be able to gain the approval of a powerful Martial Master was something worth rejoicing over.
         Some of the gloominess from before had dissipated by quite a bit.
         Hong Qing was happy for a moment, but then he was a little depressed.
         Not long ago, she had met Li Hao. Not yesterday, but on the day Li Hao fought sun moxian. Although he was also strong, Hong Qing felt that she wasn't completely powerless back then ... Even if she wasn't as strong as Li Hao, she could still fight him.
         But now, the other party was just using his power to suppress him, and he actually almost couldn't hold on.
         The difference was too great!
         "You ... How did you suddenly become so strong?" she couldn't help but ask.
         Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"the five birds technique is powerful. I've eaten a lot of Blood God's spawn, so my five internal organs have been strengthened. In addition, I've comprehended force, so it's even more powerful!" If you have a solid foundation, as long as you can comprehend force, you will be able to break through to the Qian Douluo stage with irresistible force ... Then you will have a period of rapid growth! Although you guys haven't condensed your sword force, in reality, martial uncle Hong has given you guys a very good foundation. As long as you can comprehend sword force, you can quickly improve!"
          "But I haven't comprehended the sword force yet ..." Hong Qing said regretfully.  "That's because it's not dangerous enough!"
         "Ah?"
         Li Hao sighed,'the last time I went to heaven battling city was actually the best time! But that time, your father had always brought you along, and you never acted alone. Although your Foundation is good, your killing nature is not enough. Not only you, but the others are the same. Sword Xiu actually emphasize the most on killing nature!"
         Li Hao could be considered a great swordsman now, so he had his own understanding. He said,""Whether it's a spear or a saber, it's all about the strength of one's killing nature. Martial masters are Born to Kill. It's impossible to gain momentum through pure practice!"
         Hong Qing was deep in thought while Kong Youyun thought for a while and said,""Centurion li, pure killing might not be the true meaning of martial Dao! If killing is the only thing that matters, then martial arts wouldn't be in full bloom. Second brother mu is a defensive Martial Master, but did he only focus on killing when he was cultivating?"
         "Well said!" Li Hao nodded.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com “……”
         After that, he stopped talking and ignored Kong Youyun.
         There was no need to say more to the bickering spirit.
         He was only talking to the people of swords gate. If he didn't kill people when he practiced the sword, then what about dancing?
         Why are you arguing?
         His teacher had said that if he met such a person, he should just go along with him. If it still didn't work, then he should just kill him!
         Of course, Li Hao wasn't such a person.
          However, he could tell that this golden spear disciple had his own understanding of martial arts. Li Hao didn't want everyone to agree with his ideas, as that was impossible. The path of martial arts was full of strange things, and everyone had their own ideas.
         Kong Youyun wasn't weak, and her influence wasn't weak either. It was normal for her to have her own unique insights. However, Li Hao wouldn't agree with an outsider's opinion.
         Kong Youyun was still waiting for Li Hao's wise opinion, but Li Hao said,""Junior Sister Hong, don't just stand there. I've already told brother ermu. The 30 of you will be divided into two buildings. I've already asked for your residence in advance, it's over there ..."
         He pointed into the distance and said as he walked,""Follow me, I have a few things to tell everyone."
         After he finished speaking, he left.
         After he left with his men, Kong Youyun frowned and looked at Mu Lin,"Did I say something wrong?"
         She didn't think that she had offended Li Hao. She had only shared some of her opinions. Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed very impolite.
         Mu Lin smiled and thought for a while before saying,""You're not wrong, but everyone has their own understanding. He told the swords gate that killing is the core, and that's not wrong. But now, you're saying that killing is not the only thing ... It's normal that he doesn't care about you."
         Kong Youyun was speechless.
         "Don't try to change a person's mind," Mu Lin said."All martial masters have their own principles. Some people might think that Li Hao's rapid progress is luck, but can luck really create a swordsman who can comprehend many forces? Your family is very good, your father is very strong, your teacher is also very powerful...But do you think that you have reached where you are today only because of your family background?"
        
         Kong Youyun thought for a moment and did not say anything.
         Mu Lin continued,"this guy acted really quickly. In the blink of an eye, he got 30 people. If he were to transfer a part of the Wei Wu Army, his team would be almost complete."
         Li Hao had the right to transfer 37 people, and with the 30 people today, he would soon have 60 to 70 martial masters.
         The speed was not just fast.
         p ……  Now that there were no outsiders, Li Hao was not as restrained.
         As he walked, he smiled and said,"yesterday, I looked for senior uncle Hong and asked you to join my team ... Not for you to enjoy!" I only have a few objectives that I want to share with everyone. "
         "First, kill!"
         "Second, become stronger!"
         "Third, get rich!"
          He could understand the first part, but he couldn 't. "Li Hao ..."
         "Call for the centurion!"
         “……”
         "Alright," Hong Qing corrected himself."Centurion, what do you mean by getting rich?"
         "I mean it literally!"
         Li Hao smiled."Blood God, mysterious energy, divine power stones, origin divine weapons ... Are you guys tired of this?" "Do you want an ancient weapon of enlightenment that can comprehend force? Don't you want it? You can only become stronger if you're rich, you can only eat dirt if you're poor, and you can only kill if you're strong ..."
         Beside Hong Qing, a man in his thirties said,""Centurion, who are you talking about?"
         "A person who should be killed! Don't worry, he's not an ordinary person, not a good person!"
         The man nodded and didn't ask any more questions.
         "What's your name?"Li Hao asked.
         "Hong Hao,"
         "You have the same name as me?"
         "No!" Hong Hao shook his head."The word 'vast' means 'vast'!"
         "You and senior-martial uncle Hong ..."
         "I'm master's third disciple. It's just that I grew up by master's side since I was young,"
         The third disciple ...
         That meant that there were two more. He knew one of them, and she was now Hong Yitang's wife.
         In that case, there was still a second disciple who hadn't come?
         This was because the person in front of him seemed to be the oldest.
         "Didn't martial uncle Hong's second disciple come?"
         Li Hao also asked whatever he wanted to ask.
         Hong Hao did not speak, but Hong Qing explained,""Second senior brother is not in Silver Moon. He is very talented and has broken through to the hundred perfections a long time ago. He was not satisfied with being unable to enter the thousand warrior state, so he left Silver Moon a few years ago and went to the central region."
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
         He quickly smiled and said,"there are many opportunities in the central continent, and there are also many silver moons!" Here, as long as everyone follows me and is willing to fight with me, they will all become strong sooner or later!"
         The crowd didn't say anything. Powerhouses ... Were not that simple.
         Soon, they arrived at their destination. Li Hao pointed at the small building and said,""You guys settle down. I still have things to do these two days, so you guys should familiarize yourselves with the environment. Also, someone will be coming in two days. Hong Qing, help me entertain him. He's Silver Spear's son, Liu Long. He used to be my Captain and is now a Martial Master douqian. There are also a few of my former colleagues in the Silver City, all of whom are over 100 martial masters ..."
         He simply mentioned that once these people came, the strength of his 100-man team would increase.
         However, there was still a gap.
         Even if he took some from the Wei Wu Army, it would not be enough.
         At this moment, Li Hao thought of a few people.
         However, he was not too assured.
         For example, over at Hu dingfang's side, did his Senior Sister teach him martial arts all these years?
         Hu dingfang was also a Martial Master. Did he have a Martial Master follower?
         But ... Li Hao didn't really want to go to them.
         There was also He Yong. He actually felt good, but he was from the royal family. Otherwise, the southern Fist sect would have been a good choice.
         "Southern Fist, earth-overturning sword ..."
         The next moment, he suddenly thought of a person, Wang Henggang, an expert of the tie Buyi sect, a person from the inspection Office.
         There was no problem with this person's identity. He was a native of Silver City, a true-blue fellow-townsman.  Does this person ... Have any disciples or anything?
         Li Hao didn't care about being mixed with sand. He didn't plan to lead these 100 people to rebel. If they really wanted to rebel, these 100 people wouldn't be enough!
         With these thoughts in mind, he was not in a hurry to find her.
         At this moment, he was pondering over the swift sword.
         These few days, he had to make the best use of his time. Once he had completed his fast sword technique and mastered the metal sword force, he was prepared to bring his men to do a big business and capture Ziyue!
         As for the red moon coming to the rising light, it was none of his business.
         There would naturally be someone to deal with the rising sun. Recently, several major organizations had been dealing with the red moon.
         Li Hao was very bold. It was fine if he didn't make a move, but when he made a move, he targeted Zi Yue ... With his eyes, he could find her by sweeping her little by little!
         ……
         As the swords gate arrived, Li Hao greeted them for a while before he resumed his cultivation.
         Li Hao and the Phoenix spear reappeared in the artificial forest.
         ……
         The Silver Moon was not too quiet these days.
         Although the three major organizations had given up on their plan to deal with hou Xiaochen, the four major organizations still joined forces and began their plan to wipe out the three major organizations. Hao lianchuan was eager to obtain a large number of blood gods, so he put in all his effort to track Hong Yue down and hunt them down.
         Zi Yue and LAN Yue also did not dare to show their faces.
         The red moon's troubles were not limited to this.
         There was also a group of courageous martial masters from the Silver Moon martial forest who were targeting them. Not only that, but there were also some mysterious people who were also dealing with the Crimson Moon experts. These were nothing, and there were even some extremely powerful existences who were secretly taking action.
         The three suns that Red Moon had transferred from the neighboring province had disappeared without a trace within a few days before they could show their might!
         ……
         In a Manor.
         LAN Yue smashed a table with her palm, her face ashen.
         The losses these few days were too heavy.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Not to mention that a large number of strongholds had been destroyed, a few three suns from the neighboring province had been transferred over. He had only met them once and had not had time to arrange a mission before they disappeared. He could not find them no matter what!
         As for the result, was there a need to ask?
         He was 100% dead.
         Most importantly, the mysterious disappearance of the three suns in Silver Moon was definitely not because they had run away on their own. There was a 99% chance that they had been killed by some powerful existence.
         The three suns were still Supreme existences in some provinces.
         However, when it came to the Silver Moon, it was gone without even a wave, which made Blue Moon very uncomfortable.
         In the central region, when people mentioned this province, many people would not remember it. When some of the older generation mentioned it, they would only sigh with emotion at the prosperous province of martial arts in the past. Now, they felt that it was even more terrifying than the central region!
         "There's still some time before the ruins open. I can't go on like this ... I have to recruit more powerful people. Otherwise, the Crimson Moon will completely lose her right to speak in Silver Moon!"
         As he thought about it, he gritted his teeth. If it really didn't work ... Then the 19 northern provinces would use Silver Moon as the core and gather there!
         As one of the July 's, Ying Hongyue had summoned him to Silver Moon this time and said a few things to him. She told him that he could summon the Crimson Moon's branches in the 19 northern provinces for help when necessary.
         Silvermoon was not simple!
         According to Ying Hongyue, there were too many secrets buried in this land!
         They had to give up the other provinces in the North to gain a firm foothold here.
         If he couldn't stand firm now, it would be difficult in the future.
         However, this was a difficult decision to make. Blue Moon frowned. They had given up the benefits of other provinces to come to Silver Moon. If they were to suffer a major blow, the losses would be too great. Even he could not bear such a responsibility.
          However, if this continued, he would really be chased out by the Silvermoon people.
         With a sigh, Blue Moon made the decision to gather at Silver Moon!
         Even if it was for the sake of Heaven battling city's ruins, he couldn't give up on this place.
         The other 18 provinces had quite a number of powerhouses as well. There were many in three suns, and as for rising light, there was also a powerhouse from the elders Guild in the three northern provinces. He had to stabilize the situation in Silver Moon as soon as possible.
         ……
         On this day, a large number of Crimson Moon experts from the various provinces in the North quickly gathered at Silver Moon.
         Even in the three chaotic northern provinces, there were Crimson Moon experts rushing over ... From their point of view, Silver Moon was safer. There was no other reason. At least a hundred Crimson Moon supers had died in the three northern provinces recently.
         Without exception, they were all killed by the five animal technique. No one else but Yuan Shuo!
         The news of Yuan Shuo, the murderer, quickly spread in the three northern provinces.
         [PS: I'm a little clueless about the script. I'm a little hesitant about how to start the next scenario. I thought of a few methods that I don't like. My head hurts. Brothers, please allow me to overdo it.]
        
         The Wei Wu Army.
         In the blink of an eye, it was September 12th.
         On the third day of Li Hao's visit to the Wei Wu Army.
         On this day, there were a few more people in the living quarters of the Wei Wu Army.
         Chen Jian's face was simple and honest, but there was some shock in his simplicity. Along the way, he saw many martial masters, all of whom were extremely powerful. Just the pressure of their aura alone was something that he felt many people had along the way.
         Momentum was something that could only be obtained after breaking through a hundred perfection.
         But here, it seemed that the people he met were all powerful.
         He had originally thought that he and Wu Chao had absorbed some extremely mysterious energy and rapidly advanced from the early-hundred-level to the mid-hundred-level, which was considered relatively powerful among the martial masters.
         However, who knew that when he arrived at white moon City, he realized that breaking through a hundred ... Was so weak!
         At the side, the skinny Wu Chao's eyes were also filled with shock. He didn't have his usual carefreeness. When he walked, he was a little floaty. He was so scared that he was a little floaty. There were so many experts here.
          The only one who could still hold his ground was Liu Long.
         As for Liu Yan, he couldn't see anything special about her. However, there was some urgency and envy in the depths of her eyes. With Li Hao's help, she quickly entered the late-stage of the breakthrough of 100. However, the perfection of the breakthrough of 100 was a hurdle.
         She had never felt this way about comprehending force.
         When Li Hao came to white moon City, he didn't look for her. Instead, he asked Wang Ming to see her and tell her to be as careful as possible and not to look for Li Hao for no reason, mainly because it wasn't very safe.
         This made Liu Yan very uncomfortable.
         However, she knew that in the previous situation, not meeting was perhaps the safest.
         However, now that she was in the Wei Wu Army, Liu Yan felt even more anxious and aggrieved. There were too many martial masters here, so many that she, who had broken through to the late 100th stage, was only average here. She did not feel like she could be considered a strong person without her powers.
         However, Liu Long's face was calm, and he did not make a sound.
         At this moment, he was walking forward with a young man. The young man was not Mu Lin, but the captain of the Golden spear guards, Wang Qing.
         He was just curious about Liu Long.
         The son of silver spear.
         Back then, the three Spears were equally famous in Silver Moon, and there were only three spear Dao experts in Silver Moon. Now that the bronze spear inheritance seemed to have been cut off, silver Spear's son no longer used a spear.
         He did not sense any spear Dao intent from Liu Long.
         He was rather curious about the son of the silver spear who had always stayed in the Silver City and never left.
         ? However, when they met, she felt that ... It was just so-so.
         It was a real feeling!  Liu Long didn't give him the slightest sense of oppression, only calmness, a calmness that didn't shake the water.
         This Martial Master had once said in the night patrol of the Whitemoon city that he wanted to rule the entire city by himself. He threw away the temptation of becoming a super and resolutely left the Whitemoon city. In that small silver City, he formed a so-called demon-hunting team.
         Beside him were the team members he had pulled up over the years, right?
         Three martial masters with a cultivation base of over 100 ...
         Breaking through 100 martial masters might be good in a small place like silver City, but in the Wei Wu Army, breaking through 100 was the mainstream and only the starting point. In such a large Army, more than half of the martial masters had broken through 100, and the rest were all about to advance to the tenth slash realm.
         "Liu Zhicheng, your place is just up ahead."
         Wang Qing then said,"Centurion li has been busy with his cultivation recently, so it's not convenient for me to disturb him. However, I'll tell you in advance that since you're here, Liu Zhicheng can do as he pleases. Also, help him to sort out his internal affairs. Centurion li has already formed a team of 100 people, and there are 30 of them now, all from swords gate."
         Liu Long nodded slightly and said in a cold voice,""Many thanks!"
         "You're welcome,"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wang Qing led them to the front of the small building. After some thought, he said,""Patrol Liu has settled down. You can go to the captain's place. The captain has something to discuss with patrol Liu."
         Liu Long nodded.
         Golden spear!
         Before he came here, he already knew that the Golden spear was in charge of this place. The Golden spear and the silver spear had a good relationship. The three Spears were equally famous. Before Liu Hao died, he had mentioned the silver spear to Liu Long. Liu Long had actually seen it once when he was young, but it had been many years and he had no impression of it.
         Liu Long watched as Wang Qing left. He wasn't in a hurry to find Li Hao, nor was he in a hurry to meet the swords gate.
         He brought his team members into the room he had arranged for them.
          In the small room, other than yunyao, who had become a super, the rest of the team members were all gathered. Yunyao had been assigned to be a night patrol. Liu Long didn't want to make things difficult for Li Hao. Since the Wei Wu Army wasn't willing to take in any supers, Yue Ming's super would be able to live a good life as a night patrol.
         "After going round and round ... The demon hunting squad still came to Whitemoon city."
         Liu Long said in a low voice and looked out of the window again,"since everyone has come with me, there's no need to say anything more. From today on, I'm no longer your boss. Here ... Li Hao is the one in charge. Although I'm a Qian warrior, I'm not as strong as Li Hao. Strength is one thing, but my methods and courage are not as good as Li Hao 's. "
         The few of them were silent.
         Liu Long continued,"just now, Wang Qing looked at me more than ten times on the way here. Perhaps he was thinking," this is Yin Qiang's son?" You're so weak, how can you be as famous as the Golden spear, father?"
         "I'm afraid he, the captain of the guards, went to pick me up because he wanted to measure my weight. In the end, he saw me and didn't like me. Otherwise, he would've asked to spar with me ... Now, he didn't even mention sparring. It's obvious that he doesn't like me."
         As soon as these words came out, the few of them were a little angry, but they didn't know why they were angry.
         Was there anything wrong with the other party not suggesting a spar?
         That's right.
         However, he did feel like he was being looked down upon.
        
         Liu Long continued,"brothers, you've been following me all the way. It's been almost four years since the establishment of the demon hunting squad." I didn't bring much to everyone except for the pain. Before Li Hao came, I was the only one in the team who broke through a hundred realms. "
         "If the few of you are willing, come to white moon City early. Not to mention surpassing 100 perfection, in the era of the rise of superpowers, you can rely on any one of them, be it an organization or an organization, even if they are not superpowers, they are at least in the late stage of surpassing 100 ... After a few years, what I have brought to everyone is only those insignificant 10 to 20 cubic meters of mysterious energy."
         The Silver City was too small and too weak.
         In the past few years, he had sneakily killed a few Dark Moon superpowers, but he had only obtained a small amount of mysterious powers.
         If they came to the White moon City, there would definitely be people who would be willing to take these martial masters at the peak of the ten decapitation realm. After all, once they advanced to the tenth decapitation realm, it would be very easy for Yue Ming, which was far better than struggling in the Silver City.
         "Boss!"
         "Boss, that's because we're willing!" Chen Jian said in a depressed tone. Besides, I think it's pretty good. If big brother feels uncomfortable here, we can go back to the Silver City!"
         Liu Long laughed,"no, I'm not going back!" At least, we don't have to go back now. The Silver City is still too small, even if it's our roots. But now, with Huang Yun here, the Silver City is very good. Only by coming here, everyone will have a chance to see more things and gain more benefits, and have a chance to catch up with others. "
         "Are those people outside necessarily stronger than us? Not necessarily! They are more knowledgeable and have gained more. There are benefits to small places, and that is that everyone's potential has not been developed yet ... As long as the opportunity is right, they will catch up sooner or later!"
         The crowd hurriedly nodded.
          Liu Long lightly exhaled,"I've decided to stay in the Wei Wu Army!" Face was something that one had to earn, not something that others would give out of charity. A demon hunting squad would always be first class no matter where they went ... In the past, and in the future! However, when you're here, remember that Li Hao is our core ... Don't let others see you as a joke. "
         The few of them nodded again.
         They understood what Liu Long meant. The only thing that pained them was Liu Long's feelings. He had always been the core of the team, and Li Hao had been brought up by him step by step.
         But now, Li Hao had become his boss's superior.
         The one who needed to adapt the most was actually Liu Long.
         "Li Hao ..." Chen Jian scratched his head and said.
         "Don't call his name in the future. "
         "You can call them according to their ranks in the Army," Liu Long reminded."We don't want outsiders to laugh at us and think that we're unruly."
         "Alright then!"
         Chen Jian was a little helpless, but he still changed his words,"Centurion ... This is it, right? The centurion is not here yet, should we go and meet the swords gate?"
         "Go!"
         "If we can build a good relationship, we'll be able to eat in the same pot in the future," Liu Long said with a smile. "The centurion asked me to come here because he has no foundation in white moon City. He hopes that we can help him gain a firm foothold. We can suffer some grievances, but we can't let others suffer ... Behind closed doors, we're all on the same side, so we have to win the others over as well. "
         He knew very well why Li Hao had asked him to come.
         "If the centurion is not in the team, we will be his eyes and tongue, understand?" he reminded them again.
         "Understood!"
         The few of them nodded.  Liu Long let out a breath and didn't say anything else. He believed that everyone in his team could do it, but he couldn't help but feel a little nervous and uneasy. This time, he had come to the White moon City ... He didn't know if he would be able to gain a firm foothold in the end, or if he would be able to escape back to the Silver City in a sorry state.
         Back then, he had fled back to Silver City in a sorry state.
         Also, did Li Hao want to make a name for himself in white moon City, or was self-protection enough?
         At this moment, he wasn't sure what Li Hao's purpose was.
         ……
         In the forest.
         Li Hao's sword was so fast that it even suppressed the fiery phoenix spear. However, the more Li Hao attacked, the more impatient he became.
         The momentum of the sword still couldn't be shown.
         The golden sword didn't seem to be so easy to display.
         The fire Phoenix Spear's light dimmed. It was obvious that the divine power Stone was about to be used up again. Li Hao had fed the fire Phoenix spear nine times over the past three days!
         Nine divine power stones.
         If he hadn't seized some of them before, he wouldn't even have enough for himself.
         Nine divine power stones, if exchanged for mysterious energy, would only be a few thousand cubic meters.
         But now, it had been wasted and eaten by the Phoenix spear. If the golden sword force had been fully displayed, it would have been worth it, but Li Hao felt that he had suffered a great loss since he couldn't display it.
         These few days, his sword strikes became faster and faster. It was so fast that it would take a long time before a Sonic Boom could be heard at the last moment.
          Shadowless Sword had already been cultivated to an extreme state.
         But ... It still didn't work.
         "Still no!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao struck with his sword and knocked the fire Phoenix spear away. The spear dimmed, and the ninth divine power Stone was used up.
         Li Hao exhaled and sat on the ground.
         He looked at the dimmed Fire Phoenix spear and frowned.
         After eating so many divine power stones, he was only acting as a sparring partner. In the beginning, the first few times were still effective, but the later times ... It became more and more boring. The fire Phoenix did not feel that strong.
         In the end, they didn't even pose much of a threat to Li Hao.
         At this moment, Li Hao looked at his remaining divine power stones. He still had 11.
         He then looked at the Phoenix spear, hesitating if he should feed another one.
        
         Tomorrow, Chief Steward Yu would probably take the fiery phoenix spear away.
         "My sword is already very fast, but there's still no sword momentum. Is there not enough pressure? Or something else?"
         Three days wasn't a long time.
         But whether it was earth sword form, fire sword form, or general principles of sword form, every time Li Hao grasped the core, he would comprehend force very quickly. Now that he had a general idea, he would quickly succeed in comprehending it.
         Thus, Li Hao had thought that it would be the same this time.
         Was three days not enough?
         However, it was not enough.
         A moment later, Li Hao picked up the Phoenix spear and touched it. He suddenly said,""These past few days, you've been using your fire Phoenix Force to fight with me, but I've never sensed Minister hou's intent and force ... It's impossible that Minister hou hasn't used these before, you must know. Back then, he was able to break my master's will, which means that even 20 years ago, he was still extremely powerful ... Why don't you use the will and force he left behind to deal with me?"
         When he Yong had asked him to borrow the fire Phoenix spear, he had actually wanted Li Hao to get in touch with hou Xiaochen.
         However, Li Hao didn't feel anything after a few days.
          The fire Phoenix spear had been hidden!
         The fire Phoenix spear trembled. Li Hao frowned. It was actually very difficult to communicate with a weapon.
         He could only guess.
         "Are you worried that the will of the Marquis tribe will erupt and kill me?"
         The fire Phoenix spear trembled.
         It was only for a moment.
         This meant that he was worried about this.
         However, after a while, the fire Phoenix spear started to tremble again.
         Li Hao guessed again, the energy of the divine power Stone is not enough?
         It trembled for a moment.
         Li Hao understood now. First, they were afraid of killing him. Second, the energy provided was not enough.
         Clearly, this energy was not enough for the fire Phoenix spear to release the Marquis 'intent. This meant that the Marquis' intent was indeed stronger than the fire Phoenix they were facing!
         He Yong had also said that if Li Hao could survive the attack, he would be able to gauge hou Xiaochen's strength.
         Was he Yong strong?
         Li Hao felt that perhaps his perception was not accurate. This guy might not be weak. Early three yang?
         It was hard to say.
         "How many divine power stones do you need to unleash the will of the Marquis tribe?" he looked at the fire Phoenix spear and asked.
         The fire Phoenix spear trembled.
         One, two, three ...
         Three times!
         It meant that at least three divine power stones were needed to unleash the power. Li Hao frowned. Three divine power stones were needed to unleash the power. One divine power Stone contained hundreds of cubic meters of mysterious energy. Was one or two thousand cubic meters of mysterious energy enough to unleash the power?
         This is too exaggerated!
         Of course, he definitely pocketed some of the fire Phoenix spear.
         Looking at the 11 divine power stones in the storage ring, Li Hao took a deep breath. If he wanted to feel them, he only had 8 left ...
         More importantly, he was looking for a beating.
         He spent his own money and abused himself.
         If he still didn't gain anything, he would have suffered a huge loss.
         Was hou Xiaochen's intentions really worth such a huge price?
         After hesitating for a moment, Li Hao made a decision.
          The reason why the metal sword force was still unable to appear was probably because the pressure was not enough. If the pressure was a bit more, it might be able to help him comprehend and break through.  He didn't consider anything else.
         Li Hao took out three divine power stones, all of which were gold.
         He only had three pieces of gold element.
         He didn't choose the fire element. Although the fire Phoenix spear was of the fire element, as a spear, the metal element could also display its strength.
         He took out the divine power Stone and broke it.
         In an instant, the fire Phoenix spear began to absorb.
         He seemed to be very excited.
         Li Hao also adjusted his state of mind and waited in silence.
         Could the fire Phoenix spear ... Give him a surprise?
         In the blink of an eye, the energy of the three divine power stones had been absorbed.
         The blazing Phoenix spear flickered with radiance.
         At this moment, Li Hao vaguely saw a small Phoenix swimming in the spear. Different from the previous times, this time, the fire Phoenix spear seemed to be brewing something.
         A faint Shi appeared within the spear.
         It was very thin.
         Just as Li Hao was staring at it, his vision suddenly blurred. This time, he felt as if he had fallen into an illusion and was in a trance.
         At this moment, a spear appeared in his mind.
         A spear that could Pierce the heavens!
         This spear silently pierced towards Li Hao, breaking through everything!
         At that moment, he could even hear some voices, which seemed to be hou Xiaochen 's.
         "God-splitting!"
         Cold, overbearing, and arrogant.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A spear that split the soul!
         It split the spirit and split the divine intent!
         Soul splitting spear!
         Li Hao was in a daze. At this moment, he seemed to see hou Xiaochen standing in front of him, stabbing his spear at him. Just like how hou Xiaochen easily killed the red-haired man that day, Li Hao also felt like he was being killed.
         Death ... Seemed to be right in front of him.
         At this moment, his mind was split apart. On one side, he was holding the gun, and on the other, he was suffocating from death. It was as if he had returned to that day.
         That day, his good friend was killed.
          It was this suffocating feeling ... He looked at her from a few meters away, and he felt as if his heart was being squeezed.
         That was the first time he saw the red shadow and the power of the supernatural.
         It was as if his soul had been extracted.
         He could only watch helplessly as his good friend died tragically on the spot. He could only watch as his good friend struggled and painfully told him in silence that he had to escape!
         Escape!
         It was dangerous!
         It was a feeling of despair, as if he would be the one to die the next moment.
         Today, this feeling resurfaced again.
         This was the first time Li Hao had felt so powerless and suffocated in the past year.
         Her heart was clenched tightly.
        
         ……
         At the same time.
         Hengduan Canyon.
         Hou Xiaochen suddenly frowned as he looked in the direction of the Whitemoon city. His expression was somewhat gloomy and unsightly.
         The blazing Phoenix spear ... Had been completely activated!
         Who did this?
         He knew that he had lent the fiery phoenix spear to Li Hao, but he had already sealed the spear. Unless it was in a life-and-death situation, it would not be activated, not even if Li Hao fed it a divine power Stone.
         He didn't know that the fire Phoenix had absorbed a lot of divine power stones and had long broken through his seal.
         He didn't know that the Phoenix was worried that if it couldn't satisfy Li Hao, it would be cut in half by the starry sky sword. It was afraid that the longevity sword would come for it, so it didn't have the mind to explode. If Li Hao wanted to see it, it would let him.
         Hou Xiaochen furrowed his brows as he looked in that direction, not saying anything.
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, it was too late to go back.
         He did not know what had happened to Li Hao or the fiery phoenix spear, but he knew that even a peak three-Sun Warrior would be annihilated by his spear.
         The spirit was also the divine intent.
         Martial masters had superpowers, but they did too. It was not that superpowers did not exist, but that they could not be used.
         How could powerful superpowers not have these?
         Once the fire Phoenix spear was activated, his remaining divine intent would shatter the opponent's spirit!
         Hou Xiaochen waited silently for a while, then decided not to bother with it.
         There was no use in caring.
         He could sense it a little because the blazing Phoenix spear had recognized him as its master. However, it was too far away, and it was already good enough to sense it a little. It would be a joke to expect him to suppress the blazing Phoenix spear from a thousand miles away. No matter how strong he was, he could not do it.
         ……
         At the same time.
         There was one more person who was alarmed.
         The moment Li Hao activated the fiery phoenix spear, Jin Jin, who was in the Wei Wu Army, suddenly felt a familiar aura.
         In an instant, his figure disappeared.
         When he reappeared, he was already a hundred meters in front of Li Hao.
         At this moment, his expression changed slightly, and his expression became somewhat unsightly. Li Hao...Why did he suddenly arouse the will of the Marquis?
         Most importantly, the burst of power from the fire Phoenix spear this time was too strong!
         It gave him the feeling that the Marquis was right in front of him.
         This made him think back to the time when hou bu had broken through his devil with a single spear strike. He had also vaguely seen hou Xiaochen kill five beasts with a single spear strike.
         It was a kind of spiritual suppression, the suppression of the five birds. In the end, it was broken by someone else.
         "Hou bu's spear intent does not come from the physical body ... This is troublesome!"
         At this moment, Jin Shan's face turned ugly. If he were to face this spear attack head on, he would not be afraid.
         However, at that moment, the soul splitting spear had already struck out. This spear attack involved a battle of divine will and spirit. Although he could suppress the fire Phoenix spear now ... It was actually useless.
         That was because the Spear's consciousness had already penetrated deep into Li Hao's divine will. The Golden spear did not have the ability to expel the soul-splitting spear attack from Li Hao's divine will.
         ……
          Not far away.  Li Hao's eyes, nose, and mouth were bleeding, and his body was shaking.
         In his eyes, there was only the falling spear, as if it was going to kill him.
         "The red shadow ..."
         Li Hao murmured in his heart. At this moment, he seemed to see a red shadow. Although there was no similarity between the two, they both caused him a great danger of death, just like a year ago.
         I was scared away once!
         That time, Zhang Yuan was very close to her. She was worried, afraid, and fearful. She wanted to go forward, but she didn't dare.
         If one were to say that the inner demon of Silvermoon's other martial masters was Yuan Shuo.
         The red shadow might be Li Hao's inner demon.
         Even though he had killed the red shadow, Zhang Yuan had still died. That night, he had cowered. He had been afraid, even though he knew that it wasn't his fault. He had been an ordinary person that day. When he had seen that scene for the first time, he had been truly afraid, so afraid that he had trembled.
         ? Li Hao couldn't control his fear.
         But today ... When he felt the same feeling again, fear appeared in Li Hao's eyes. After the fear, there was a kind of madness.
         From the moment he came into contact with superpowers, from the moment he stepped into the martial arts world.
         He continued to grow stronger, continued to look for opportunities, and continued to take risks. Whether it was killing Zhang Ting, taking the risk to hunt down the experts of the three large organizations, killing Yu Xiao, or killing Huang Jie ... His thoughts were actually very simple. I don't want to experience that powerless scene again.
         The first time he killed someone, he killed so cold-blooded and merciless that Liu Yan and the others called him a pervert ... Was he afraid?
         There were some.
         Was it disgusting?
         A little.
         But in his heart, he wasn't that afraid. He had seen things more terrifying than this.
         Are you trying to scare me again this time?
         That was impossible!
         Fire sword form, earth sword form, sword form superclass ...
         Three forces instantly appeared in his mind.
         Mountains and tigers appeared ...
         In his eyes, the sword of his ancestor and the sword of the silver warrior appeared!
          What kind of fear could not be broken by a long sword?
         If there is, it means that your sword is not strong enough!
         "Kill!"
         With a mental shout, Li Hao instantly brandished his sword!
         He had done his best with this sword!
         All of his enlightenment, all of his explosive power, was contained within that single sword strike. He was going to break through the spear strike, break through the red shadow's intimidation that had threatened him that night.
         Sword intent emerged!
         In the blink of an eye, they had merged into a "self-severing sword." With a single slash, the soul-splitting spear pierced through the sky. This was hou Xiaochen's will, but who cared?
         In reality, the fire Phoenix spear trembled slightly.
         Li Hao unsheathed his sword. Although it was not fast, it exploded in an instant, and a small sword slashed out. The fiery phoenix spear seemed to be frightened by this attack. In the blink of an eye, it pierced through the void and disappeared.
