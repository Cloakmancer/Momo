        those who had just emerged from behind could not react in time.
         He had just emerged ... BOOM!
         After a series of attacks, the ground exploded and the two earth element supers didn't even have the chance to escape.
         The demon hunt squads "attacks were also somewhat chaotic.
         Everyone was focused on killing a few people, and sometimes there would be some conflicts.
         When the team leaders saw this, they hurriedly shouted,""Split up, don't gather together!"
         There were too many people. They were all gathered together and fighting. Everyone was squeezing each other, and it was a mess.
         They were in a mess, so were the people of the red moon.
         At this moment, the ground suddenly opened up, a stone moved away, and more than a dozen supers suddenly emerged. Both sides looked at each other, and in the blink of an eye, the red moon's people shouted,""Enemy attack! It's a Martial Master!"
         As for the demon hunt squads, they instantly reacted, that was the entrance!
          "He's underground, kill him quickly!"
         BOOM!
         In the blink of an eye, a few martial masters rushed over, and the supers also came back to their senses. Some used their superpowers, while others used the red shadow. In an instant, both sides were in a chaotic battle.
         ……
         Li Hao stood on a tree in the distance and watched silently.
         In a short while, Liu Long returned with the axe in his hand still stained with blood. He exhaled and said,""It's settled!"
         Li Hao nodded.
         Liu Long also looked down and frowned,""It's too chaotic! "It's a mess. The small teams are all mixed together, and some of the martial masters with over 100 levels of strength don't even have the awareness to cooperate. It's all you killing you, I killing me ..."
         If he were to lead the team alone, he would have been worried to death.
         However, Li Hao's presence put him at ease.
         However, the chaotic battle in front of him made him a little annoyed.
         Li Hao nodded."That's why we skipped the training process. We'll let them fight directly. They'll know what the problem is after a fight."
         BOOM!
         Below them, a fierce battle erupted.
         As Red moon's sunlit Warriors ran up from the ground, the martial masters who had the upper hand were quickly pushed back by them. The powerhouse at the peak of the sunlit realm was a metal-elemental powerhouse.
         At this moment, a punch was thrown out, and a loud boom rang out. Wang Chao, who was charging at the front, was directly sent flying by this punch. A late-stage cultivator who had broken through 100 and was wearing a black armor, this punch also made Wang Chao dizzy!
         At this moment, Liu Yan shouted,"defense system in front! Captain, deal with riyao! Don't panic!"  Hong Qing was also extremely anxious. She was very powerful, but at this moment, she was being squeezed by a few fellow disciples and could not get in. She could only follow and shout,""Team one, kill to the left!"
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hong Yue's powerhouses had thought that they had encountered the black armored Army.
         However, when they really started fighting, other than the few supers who died at the start, the black-armored martial masters seemed to be in a mess and their coordination was even worse than theirs!
         The leader's eyes flickered as if he had thought of something. He shouted,""Kill them! This is hei Teng, and these are the swords gate! The swords gate is really bold, they actually dared to ambush us! Be careful of Hong Yitang nearby. Quick, kill them. The black banner is very valuable. The higher-ups are buying it. One divine power Stone for one set!"
         Hei Teng, a Martial Master ...
         The first thing he thought of was swords gate.
         The existence of the black banner in heaven battling city was no longer a secret, and the swords gate martial masters had also managed to obtain some of it.
         At this moment, the only thing he had to be careful of was the two three suns of swords gate.
         If they weren't here ... These random martial masters would become their prey sooner or later, even though they had strong defenses.
         Once they heard that a set cost one divine power Stone ... Those superpowers were also extremely envious.
         Soon, a superpower shouted,"work together! Everyone, work together! These martial masters are useless if they are not at the Qian warrior level! Earth element trap formation! Follow the red moon's rules! Quick!"
         Under someone's command, the entire Red moon's team quickly cooperated.
         The earth-element experts shook the ground, forming many pits and restricting the black-armored martial masters to a certain area. Once they moved forward, they would easily trip over the messy pits.
         "Fire-type long-range attacks, wood-type attacks, and sky-type attacks, hurry ..."
         These Crimson moon's supers were able to adapt to the battle even faster than the demon hunt squads, and were often involved in battles in various places. Although many of them didn't know each other, they were still able to divide the work.
          In the blink of an eye, the fireballs charged towards Liu Yan and the others!
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         The black-armored martial masters were forced back by the power and the trees on the ground quickly grew and wrapped around them.
         The black armor was hard to break and had a strong defense, but it could still trap them.
         The few sun glory powerhouses were in charge of the main attack.
         Even if a metal-type powerhouse at the peak of the sun glory realm couldn't kill over 100 martial masters in the black banner with a single punch, he could still send them flying. Then, the sky-type martial masters in the sky would quickly attack the ground. The moment they landed, countless branches would extend out from the ground. If they avoided the branches, they might fall into a huge hole and be covered by countless soil.
         The martial masters, who had the upper hand just a moment ago, were suddenly suppressed as the battle continued.
         The team leaders attacked one after another. They weren't weak and could kill the enemy, but the effect wasn't satisfactory and they were quickly pushed back.
         If not for the black banner, they would have lost at least half of their men.
         On the other hand, there was no black Phoenix, and they were suddenly attacked. Only seven or eight supers died, and the situation quickly stabilized.
        
         ……
         Liu Long's brows were tightly knitted.
         "AI!"
         Sighing, he looked at Li Hao. This was the demon hunt squad that Li Hao wanted to bring out to hunt powerhouses. To be honest, it was too chaotic.
         At this moment, there were even seven or eight martial masters who had been completely captured. They were locked up and buried in the soil, unable to move.
         The black Banner's defense was strong, but once the shock wave was released, the Martial Master inside would also be killed.
         He was not invincible!
         Li Hao watched in silence. He thought of the heaven battling Army. If the heaven battling Army had 50 people, they might not be stronger than these martial masters, but if they worked together, half of these superpowers could be killed in one round. At most, they could charge once, but these superpowers might be wiped out.
         Of course, those were the elite troops of the ancient civilization.
         These martial masters now were all stragglers.
          Originally, he wanted to prevent these people from running away, but now ... These superhumans didn't even want to run away. What they wanted to do now was to completely annihilate the demon hunt squad and seize the black banner. If it wasn't for the fact that the few sunlight squad leaders were somewhat afraid of Hong Yitang, and had the Red Shadows wander around to look for him, and then working together with the Red Shadows, these few over 100 squad leaders wouldn't have been able to hold on.
         The black banner could block the invasion of some of the Red Shadows, but it was still disturbed. There was a red shadow lying on Liu Yan's body. Through the armor, it was invading Liu Yan's body and corroding her inner strength.
         As some martial masters were captured and the other party didn't discover Hong Yitang's existence, the few sunlight sect members became more daring. They roared and attacked more fiercely. In the blink of an eye, Liu Yan and the others were forced to retreat.
         Their strong defense was only a life-saving measure, not an effective counterattack.
         At this moment, the team leaders and the other martial masters were all anxious. They had thought that it would be an easy task, but reality had given them a heavy blow. More and more martial masters were captured by the other party and locked to the side, unable to move.
         At this moment, Li Heng also roared,""Substitution ... One team of swordsmen, one team of defense, one team of martial masters ..."
         The team was in a mess.
         It also seriously interfered with the performance of the others.
         Following Li Heng's roar, Hong Qing also immediately shouted,""Swords gate swordsmen, attack with me! Don't panic!"
         "Kill!"
         As they adjusted their positions, the remaining martial masters no longer moved in their original teams. Instead, they adjusted their positions, defending at the front and attacking at the back. Some of them used their inner strength to shatter the superpowers on the ground, no longer allowing the ground to become their grave.
         This was actual combat.
         At this time, they could quickly adjust. If it was training, it would be difficult to see the results so quickly.
         "Those who are good at movement, follow me and we'll kill the sky descent super!"
         At this moment, Wu Chao also let out a loud roar. He stomped on the ground and rose into the air quickly. His speed was extremely fast. A few martial masters with powerful movement techniques also rose into the air quickly and fought against the sky descent super in the air!
         There were superpowers in the sky and on the ground. Martial masters had much fewer means before they could fight Qian.
         However, Black Phoenix had also evened out this gap.
         As the situation of the martial masters stabilized, both sides gradually suffered casualties.  In the distance, Liu Long's furrowed brows gradually relaxed.
         After all, martial masters were not idiots.
         Now that they were in danger, they had to make adjustments. Although they had lost about one-third of their martial masters, the team had finally stabilized and started to fight against the supers.
         "Hu!"
         Liu Long exhaled. Li Hao also revealed a smile. Among these martial masters, there were some who were very clear-headed. To be honest, they didn't know much about formations either. However, at this moment, these people naturally formed a formation and dealt with the attack of the supers very well.
         He observed carefully, taking in everyone's performance.
         Looking at the time, the battle had been going on for about five minutes.
         The commotion was not small. Fortunately, they were in the wilderness. However, if they continued fighting, the power fluctuations would attract some powerhouses sooner or later.
         Just as the two sides were engaged in a fierce battle.
         The expression of the leading sunlit super changed.
         In the next moment, to everyone's shock, a sword light came from a distance. In an instant, it was like a tiger coming out of its cage. With a slash of the sword, the bodies of several powerful sunlit Warriors in front of him were split open!
         The four sunlit cultivators were killed on the spot by this sword attack!
         The supers "side collapsed instantly.
         Hong Qing and the others were even more shocked. Sword force!
         Li Hao's sword attack!
         "What are you doing? Kill, exterminate them! Faster!"
         As the sunlit Warriors were killed by him, the rest of the supers lost their will to fight and fled.
          "Hong Yitang!" Someone shouted,"how dare you plot against Hong Yue...Swords gate will be destroyed ..."
         Obviously, the other party had mistaken Li Hao for Hong Yitang!
         Li Hao didn't bother with them. He stabbed his sword into the ground, and several earth element supers who were trying to escape were instantly cut into pieces.
         In front of them, Hong Qing and the others also exploded.
         The sword energy swept across and killed all the Espers who were running away.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In mid-air, a few of the sky descent supers were about to fly away, but before they could escape, one of them swung his axe down from the sky. Liu Long killed one of them with one swing of his axe, then quickly swung it and killed all of the Yue Ming supers in the blink of an eye!
         Liu Yan and the others also started to kill their enemies. In the blink of an eye, the entire place quieted down.
         The sound of panting continued.
         Li Hao cut open the shackles with his sword. The dozen or so martial masters who had been bound by the shackles were all red-faced and speechless.
         Their expressions could not be seen due to their armor, but it was obvious that being captured in battle was not something to be proud of.
        
         Li Hao's voice was calm."Clean up the battlefield. Collect mysterious energy. Send people down to clean up the stronghold ... I'll give everyone ten minutes. Then, retreat!"
         No one spoke.
         However, very quickly, some people started to go down, some started to deal the last blow, and some started to collect mysterious energy.
         ,m At this moment, the martial masters were all silent.  If not for the black Phoenix and Li Hao's strength, they would have probably been annihilated.
         Meanwhile, Li Hao reached out and grabbed the dead peak sunlit super.
         The energy storage ring activated, and a moment later, it contained about 300 cubic meters of metal-type mysterious energy.
         Li Hao looked at Liu Long."This is for the bait. Record it."
         "Yes!"
         Liu Long nodded. He was not envious or jealous, nor did he feel that it was inappropriate. Although the bait did not do anything, they were very dangerous. If they were not careful, they could be easily killed.
          ……
         Not far away.
         At that moment, Wang Ming and the others were all parched.
         They had heard the commotion long ago and had rushed over quickly. They had also seen the scene of the battle, and had seen a large number of superpowers being killed. The sunbringer had been killed in one strike, and four sunbrers had actually been unable to block a single strike ... Except for Wang Ming, everyone else was trembling with fear!
         "Old Wang ... Your ... Your senior brother ... Is too strong!"
         "That's right. He killed a few sunlit cultivators with a single sword strike ... It's too terrifying!"
         "And that ... Is that Liu Long? Douqian is also very powerful, he killed a few sky-flying Masters with his axe ..."
         “……”
         The few of them were excited. They had never seen such a great battle scene before. Hundreds of martial masters with superpowers fought, but the result was that all of their superpowers were annihilated, and dozens of them died.
         Such a scene was rare in Silver Moon.
         This time, it was the right decision to come.
         Just watching this battle was worth it.
         As he was thinking this, a figure appeared. Li Hao threw the energy storage ring to Wang Ming."Here you go, 300 cubic meters of metal elemental energy, you can split it among yourself. This is the reward for this! You can continue. The more experts you attract, the greater the harvest, and the more benefits you'll get! Of course, the danger will also be greater ... I won't be able to arrive so quickly every time, and I won't be able to make it in time every time. It's your choice whether you want to withdraw or not!"
         Li Hao quickly disappeared.
         300 cubic meters ...
         It wasn't a lot for the second-generation heirs, but they were a little excited.
         Even if they were to split it evenly, each person would not have much. Their family could afford dozens of cubic meters.
         But ... They had earned it by themselves!
         "I ... Old Wang ... I earned the mysterious energy by myself!" Zhou Qin was a little excited.  They did not participate in the battle, but they were still extremely nervous and excited. They also knew that there were so many supers nearby. If Li Hao's team was even a little late, they would be finished.
         However ... At this moment, they didn't want to leave at all. They were only excited and excited.
         It was a different feeling to earn money by himself!
         "What's this?"Wang Ming sneered. I'll tell you, I've killed three suns!"
         "What?"
         "It's true. My senior brother and I killed it together ... Of course, don't tell anyone. It's just that someone attacked my senior brother in the alley last time ... Well, it was that time that we joined forces to kill three suns!"
         He didn't dare to say anything about Zhang Ting, but the incident in the alley was no longer a secret.
         Wang Ming felt great; he had finally bragged!
         If they had not seen it with their own eyes, no one would have believed him even if he were to brag about it.
         At that moment, Wang Ming also chuckled. "Isn't my senior brother righteous? 300 cubic meters ... How long would it take for a night patrol to earn that much? Let's go to the next place. It's a little dangerous, but as long as we're clear-headed, this time ... We'll make a fortune and see an even stronger battle!"
         The few of them were extremely excited and quickly left.
         They went to the next place and continued to show off.
         ……
         And at this moment, Li Hao looked at the rapidly gathering demon hunt squads and laughed,"Why are you depressed? Didn't he win? Let's go and find a place to rest for the night. Everyone, think about it and see if we should regroup. This is just a small scene. If we are depressed today, how can we do anything big?"
         As soon as he said that, everyone was shocked!
         Li Hao didn't blame him.
         "Let's go. I'm also a newbie. Everyone can slowly get used to each other. We've gained a lot tonight ... I hope that we'll all have over 100 points tomorrow!"
         Killing more than 40 supers was a huge gain.
          At this moment, the crowd finally felt some excitement from the victory.
         We ... Have killed so many Crimson Moon supers!
         At this moment, everyone had complete faith in Li Hao. Li Hao was too strong, mysterious, and had many tricks up his sleeve. He had found a stronghold in the blink of an eye. As martial masters, they knew how difficult it was to find the stronghold of the three major organizations.
         Liu Long just watched silently, then looked at Li Hao and smiled.
         This team was not mature yet.
         However, as the battle went on, these people would become stronger and stronger, and they would have more and more tacit understanding. As for Li Hao ... He would become more and more prestigious. Did this kid really not know how to do it, or did he have special means?
         What else could be easier to integrate into the team than this?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The first battle was a victory, and the gains were not small.
         And Liu Long knew that this was only the beginning.
         If Hong Yue couldn't stop them quickly and found them ... She would only suffer more and more losses.
        
         In the wilderness.
         A group of martial masters sat on the ground in a Mountain Valley.
         At this moment, some of the martial masters were silent, some were meditating, and some were still thinking about the previous battle.
         49 people, not a single one missing.
         However, there were still martial masters who were injured. Some were shaken, and some were attacked by the sunlight. Although they did not die, they still had some internal injuries.
         However, even though they were injured, no one dared to say anything.
         They were all thinking back and reflecting on this battle.
         There were many questions.
         At this moment, Li Hao returned with some red balls in his hand."This is the blood God. Only an original divine weapon can extract it. You should have felt it before. It's invisible, but you can still sense it."
         "The most important thing now is not to wait to return and share the spoils of war, but to use the current gains to make everyone stronger quickly."
          "So, we can't be in a hurry to distribute the spoils. We need to make everyone stronger quickly. When we're strong, we can think about these things ..."
         After saying that, 29 blood pills flew toward some of the black armors in the crowd.
         It was extremely accurate and landed in front of the 29 people.
         They were all at the tenth realm!
         "Swallow, absorb, and digest! If you have indigestion, let me know, and I'll use the five birds breathing technique to help you digest it ... Almost all of them are Dark Moon-level Blood God clones, just enough to satisfy everyone's needs. "
         Of the 29 people, some were tempted, while some were too embarrassed to take it.
         "Commander," a tenth realm Martial Master said in a low voice,"we didn't make any contributions in this battle. When we fought, we were captured by the enemy at a very close distance. If it weren't for hei Teng's protection, we would've died long ago."
         Li Hao nodded."You know shame and become brave. You're indeed a burden. That's because you're too weak!" If you can break through 100 by devouring a Scion of the blood God, then that's a success. Otherwise ... You'll only become more and more of a burden. "
         Everyone stopped talking.
         A moment later, someone picked up the blood God and stuffed it into his mouth. The sealed armor revealed his mouth and he swallowed it.
         With someone taking the lead, the others also began to consume the blood God.
         The remaining 100 were all watching silently.
         Li Hao continued,"tonight, you can form a new team. Once you've confirmed it, don't change it." When we're done regrouping, I'll teach everyone a set of military formations. Tonight, we should understand that sometimes more people doesn't mean more power, but more cooperation is needed. "
         "To make the collective power stronger, to make one plus one greater than two, fighting side by side, that's the fighting style of a street thug. After all, we're not street thugs."
         "Commander," Hong Qing said,"can we use military formations between teams?"
          "Of course!"  Hong Qing was a little confused, but he did not say anything.
         Because there were only 10 people in the team, a 10-person formation ... She had actually communicated with some martial masters in the past two days. The Wei Wu Army did not have any 10-person formation, and the lowest was a 100-person formation.
         Swords gate did have some formations as well, but they were only there to complement each other.
         A real battle formation was not as simple as just coordination.
         She didn't know if Li Hao's so-called battle formation was just a means of cooperation.
         Li Hao quickly dispelled her doubts and said,""This military formation is called the ten ring Mountain-sealing formation. It's a type of military formation excavated from an archaeological ruin. When using the formation, everyone has to use the same breathing technique. The inner strength has to be connected to form a cycle, and the formation has a master. "
         "When using the formation, ten people can use their inner strength together, or gather inner strength in one person to strengthen one person, making the person in charge of the formation even stronger!"
         "Every formation requires 10 people to form a closed loop ... Similarly, after the formation of a 100-person team, the 10 people in charge of the formation can form a cycle again. The person in charge of the formation will be able to contain the inner strength of 100 people ..."
         Everyone's expression changed when they heard this.
         An ancient formation!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Moreover, this was a real ancient formation technique, not some simple coordination. This was the connection of inner strength. Everyone was a Martial Master, and they were not fools. They knew what this meant.
         Li Hao continued,"the formation must be kept a secret. It can't be leaked!" "The core is this breathing technique that can be used at the same time. Once used, the attribute and frequency of the inner strength will be the same."
         "By then, a formation formed by 10 tenth realm cultivators will definitely be able to deal with over 100 people."
         "Similarly, if 10 people can break through 100, there's still hope to deal with a thousand-man combat ..."
          "In addition, with the black armor, their defense is strong. If they can form a formation of a hundred people, if the members of the team are all over a hundred martial masters, they can definitely fight above their level if they concentrate their inner strength into the warrior's body!"
         The premise was that the expert who gathered the inner strength at the end had a strong physical body that could withstand it and display such strength.
         Everyone's mouths were dry.
         Liu Long couldn't help but ask,"there's such an ancient formation?" Do you have any special requirements?"
         "Of course there is ... Don't let anyone mess up and break one of the links ... As long as you don't do it on purpose, even if someone breaks one link, the others can quickly reconnect the closed loop."
         " 10 people is the best choice. In fact, 9 or even less is fine ..."
         Liu Long gave Li Hao a deep look. You're just going to casually spread this information?
         Once it was divulged ... It would be very troublesome.
         How long have you known the people in the team?
         Do you really think that they are all loyal to you?
        
         At this moment, he couldn't quite understand Li Hao's actions. Although Li Hao was doing this for the sake of strengthening the demon hunt squad, some of these people were from swords gate, and some were from the inspection Office. How many of them were truly on the same side as Li Hao?
         At this moment, Hong Qing had no choice but to say,""Guild leader, is this appropriate? I'm not saying that someone intentionally leaked it out, but if they were to accidentally leak it out ... As far as I know, there doesn't seem to be any similar formations in the Silver Moon region, right?"
         "Even the Wei Wu Army's Tianxuan formation doesn't seem to work like this. After joining forces, their combat power will increase slightly, but they can't use inner strength ..."
         Li Hao nodded."That's because the level of their formation is slightly lower. The ten-Ring Mountain-sealing formation should be of a higher level." As for the leakage ... I can't control everyone's hearts. If it really leaks, I'll just investigate it. If I find it, I'll take revenge. If I can't find it, what else can I do?"
         Li Hao laughed,"I can't just keep the means to improve everyone and let everyone die for no reason, can I?" Moreover, this was only a formation that could only be used by a person. He couldn't form a formation by himself. Whether or not the demon hunt squad can have a greater harvest, it's up to everyone, and not me alone. I might be stronger than all of you, but even if I'm strong, if I really run into trouble and get trapped inside, I might still have to rely on everyone's rescue. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "The tenth severing will first digest the blood God and become a hundred martial masters. First, listen to my breathing technique. This breathing technique is called the 'mountain sealing technique.' According to ancient records, this formation originated from the ancient civilization, from a faction called the Blessed Grotto-heaven. "Of course, my teacher has another explanation for this." Heavenly abode "may not be the name of a force, but a collective name for a group of forces. There are many records in ancient books that these words have appeared ... This is not too important."
         A blessed Grotto-heaven!
         Everyone remembered it. But Li Hao was right. It didn't matter where he came from. The ancient civilization had disappeared long ago. No one cared too much about the specific situation back then.
         Soon, Li Hao began to teach the breathing technique.
          Breathing techniques weren't difficult. As a Martial Master, in addition to the core breathing technique that they had to learn, they knew some other breathing techniques. Li Hao knew several, and the other martial masters present also knew some other breathing techniques.
         Following Li Hao's teaching, some people's auras gradually changed.
         From this, one could actually see the comprehension and intelligence of some people.
         For example, as Hong Yitang's daughter, Hong Qing was indeed very smart. Not long after Li Hao finished speaking, Hong Qing's breathing rhythm changed. After a while, Hong Qing released his inner strength, and there was a slight difference in his inner strength.
         His inner strength was still as strong as before.
         However, there seemed to be an additional layer that had been changed by the breathing technique.
         Hong Qing had just learned it, but Hong Hao had also learned it in no time. Then, Li Heng, Wu Chao, Liu Yan, and then Wang Chao ...
         The six Captain-level characters had learned it one after another.
         As for the disciples of swords gate, they were generally faster in learning the technique.
         Even the martial masters from the inspection Office were slower.
         This was the difference.
         The martial masters of the inspection Office were all from Silver city's Inspection Office back in the day. Some of them had become monks halfway through their lives, some of them were from the outside world, and some of them had learned martial arts from Wang Henggang and Liu Long.
         As for the disciples of swords gate, they were all chosen by Hong Yitang himself, and their learning ability was very fast.  At this moment, Hong Qing was somewhat curious and tried it out. In an instant, her and Hong Hao's inner strength came into contact and actually connected together. Hong Qing's face was filled with surprise and shock, but it was hidden behind her peeking, so her expression could not be seen.
         However, in the depths of his heart, he was still shocked beyond words.
         How was that possible?
         The inner strength ... Could really be fused.
         The disciples of swords gate all cultivated the core technique of the overbearing sword, and they could be considered to be from the same sect. Except for a few that were different, the rest of the techniques were the same, but there was no situation where the inner strength was connected.
         How could this kind of breathing technique be able to do it?
         Hong Qing was puzzled.
         The talkative Li Heng couldn't understand and asked directly,""Captain, we have fellow disciples who also practice the same breathing technique. Why can't we merge our inner strength?"
         "I don't know,"
         Everyone was stunned.
         Li Hao laughed."I really don't know. Perhaps the breathing technique of the formation is a little special. Otherwise, how can it be called a formation?" If they could all merge with each other, then there would be no need to talk about formations. If they were from the same sect, then that would all be formations. "
          "Or perhaps, the secret hidden within is too advanced. Our level is too low right now, so we can't pry into it. Perhaps the breathing technique of the formation has some special characteristics."
         The crowd nodded. At this moment, they were all excited.
         These people began to try to connect with each other.
         The breathing technique was only one part of the array.
         Li Hao continued,"other than the breathing technique, the second key to the ten-ringed mountain-sealing array is positioning!" This formation is more suitable for sieging. It's mainly used to deal with existences stronger than you ... And not against weaklings. "
         "The ten ring Mountain seal, as you can see from its name, mainly forms a closed ring to besiege the enemy and seal the enemy's ability to fight back ..."
         He began to narrate them one by one.
         These were all written in ancient books, and Li Hao had never tried them before.
         Yuan Shuo had taught him too many ancient books, and Li Hao was still unable to comprehend or experience them. The only thing he could do was to memorize them and share them with everyone when the time was right.
        
         While talking about formations, Li Hao was also thinking about his teacher.
         His teacher had dug up so many graves and knew a lot of ancient books, but other than the five birds technique, he seemed to have only studied the "Blood Blade technique." Did he not know how to use it, or was he too lazy to use it?
         After a while, Li Hao said to the crowd,""All team leaders, remember it by yourselves. Later, if anyone doesn't know how to do it, you can explain it by yourselves. How you distribute it and how you use it is up to you. "
         After saying that, Li Hao ignored them.
         Instead, he began to patrol. The martial masters of the tenth realm were all absorbing and digesting the blood God. However, without the help of a sword, the effect was not very good.
         The efficiency was low, and the utilization rate was low.
         These people were almost all at the peak of the ten decapitation realm. It could be said that they were almost certain to break through the 100-point threshold. However ... If the utilization rate was too low, it would be very difficult to advance.
         Li Hao glanced at the ten executioners and suddenly took out three divine power stones.
         In the previous battle, although he had killed many people, he had seized one divine power Stone. Only the gold-type sunlit man had one, and he had borrowed these three from the Golden spear.
         There were still too few treasures like the divine power Stone in Dayao.
          His action made many people look at him.
         "A divine power Stone?"
         Someone said in a low voice, obviously recognizing him.
         Li Hao nodded."Yes, I borrowed it from the chiliarch. The price is the remaining Black Phoenix ... If we can't get enough divine power stones this time, the remaining Black Phoenix won't belong to us. This is from swords gate ... I used the breathing technique of five birds to break the divine power stones and help everyone digest the energy of the blood God ... If we can't get enough divine power stones later, you will be responsible for this!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he crushed three divine power stones and activated the five birds breathing technique. Waves of energy were absorbed by him, and in the blink of an eye, a small energy tide was set off.
         The violent energy tide was only secondary.
         The key was that Li Hao took the opportunity to release some sword energy with the small sword. The sword energy merged with the energy, and in an instant, the energy shot out toward the 29 people.
         As soon as it entered their bodies, the martial masters who had difficulty absorbing it instantly felt the difference.
         The blood energy instantly became docile!
         The martial masters were overjoyed. BOOM!
         Someone's inner strength instantly erupted and was released.
         The other 100-plus martial masters were all shocked. Was this the breathing technique of five birds?
         So powerful!
         Of course, it was also an exaggeration. He had spent three divine power stones at once. These three divine power stones should be enough to exchange for thousands of cubic meters of mysterious energy, right?
         This poor man wasn't fit to use this method!
         After the first person broke through 100, a second person quickly appeared.
         The energy from the three divine power stones was still very rich. It was enough to help these ten slash realm cultivators completely digest it if it continued to operate.  After about 20 minutes, the energy completely dissipated.
         He had absorbed everything he needed to.
         At this moment, Li Hao looked at the martial masters of the ten execution realm. There were 29 of them, 20 from swords gate and 9 from the inspection Office.
         If he didn't take a look, he wouldn't have known, but with one look, the 20 swords gate ten slash realm cultivators had all advanced, this was the most terrifying thing.
         As for the nine people from the inspection Division, only six of them successfully advanced.
         Three of them failed, or rather, they did not manage to release their inner strength. In an instant, the three of them were extremely depressed.
         Out of the 29 martial masters, only the three of them had failed.
         The key was that the price he had to pay was not small.
         One blood God bead and the energy from the divine power stones were equivalent to consuming hundreds of cubic meters of mysterious energy. In the end ... They failed!
         "Guild leader ... We ..."
         The three of them were extremely dejected.
         All of his previous thoughts had disappeared. The only thing left was that he was too useless.
         On average, they were slightly older than the disciples of swords gate, but in the end, the disciples of swords gate had all advanced to the next round. Out of the nine of them, one-third of them had failed. The number of failures was too high, it was not just 3 out of 29.
         Wang Chao, Wang Henggang's nephew, also had a grave expression on his face.
         At this moment, there was a clear difference in talent between the people sent by his uncle and the people sent by the swords gate.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com These guys from swords gate were all talented, but they were just mediocre.
          Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care too much. The swords gate disciples had all advanced, and they were indeed stronger than expected. However, the so-called aptitude could only be considered after they had broken through 100 and comprehended [force].
         If he couldn't comprehend force, then he didn't have any martial Dao aptitude.
         "It's no big deal. You didn't succeed this time, but it's not like you didn't gain anything. You were just one step away. You might have succeeded tomorrow morning!"
         Li Hao didn't say much. He looked at those who had successfully advanced and said,""You've successfully advanced in rank, so there's no need to be too happy about it. We don't have much time left, so let's get used to our new strength as soon as possible. Let your team leader teach you some formations ..."
         After instructing them for a while, he no longer bothered with these people.
         The entire team became more active, and a fire was ignited in everyone's hearts. The small goal that Li Hao had mentioned yesterday was almost completed tonight. It turned out that it was really nothing to have all the members break a hundred points.
         The three who failed received comfort from everyone. They failed this time, but they could try again. The next time, they would gain something. With the experience of this failure, it would not be difficult to break 100.
         ……
         Li Hao walked out of the valley, exhaled, and looked into the distance.
         In the distance, under the night sky, there seemed to be a huge crack, and the earth seemed to have split open. That was the great canyon that cut across the Silver Moon, the one that divided the north and south.
        
         Liu Long also quickly followed.
         "Boss, do you have any thoughts?" Li Hao chuckled.
         "You're such a prodigal!"
         This was how Liu Long felt. He had spent almost all of his clones of Blood God in an instant. He had only obtained about this much, and he had even lost three divine power stones, although he had obtained a lot of mysterious energy this time.
         However, Li Hao didn't take much from the attack. He had lost everything.
         "When they've all become stronger and have broken through the 100-point threshold, they'll learn formations ... Ten of them will be the ones leading the formation in the later stages. Together with Black Phoenix, each team will be able to deal with the sunlit division. They'll have the ability to kill the sunlit division.
         "After that, I'll recycle it, kill enemies, and become stronger ... Perhaps I'll be able to bring back enough gains very soon!"
         Li Hao chuckled."Before breaking through the late-stage of 100, I'll invest some of my energy and give them some benefits. However, to break through the late-stage of 100 to perfection, one needs to comprehend force. At that time, if they can't reach perfection, they won't have much to consume ..."
         "Yeah, that's true."
         "Then, when are we going back this time?" Liu Long nodded and asked.
          "When we were unable to improve, the Crimson Moon experts were alarmed and chased after us ..."
         Li Hao laughed."From now on, we'll move at night. During the day, we'll practice and rest. We'll familiarize ourselves with the formation."
         Liu Long did not say anything more and turned around to leave.
         Li Hao also looked into the distance with some anticipation.
         This time, he had his own goal for leading the demon hunt squad, and that was to obtain enough high-quality Blood God clones. The three suns would be his first step, and sunguang ... Was temporarily out of his consideration.
         In addition, there were divine power stones, which were probably only available in the three suns.
         Therefore, this time, he had to kill some three-sun powerhouses.
         As for those below the three-yang realm, Li Hao didn't really care about the rewards even if he killed them. A month ago, he had treated them as treasures, but now, they were just worldly possessions.
         ……
         In the blink of an eye, the sky brightened.
         16th of September.
         The place where last night's battle had taken place was already empty. Wang Ming and the others had already driven off in their small cars to the next place where there might be experts.
         The Crimson Moon stronghold was as quiet as ever.
         After an unknown period of time, a figure wearing a Ghostface appeared. He made some noise outside the stronghold, but there was no reply.
         The other party didn't wait any longer and directly burrowed into the ground.
         A moment later, they fled the stronghold in a hurry.
         Downstairs, the building was empty. He didn't pay much attention to it just now, but now that he came up to take a look, there were obvious traces of battle. It was obvious that an accident had happened and this stronghold had been discovered.
         ……  Outside the White moon City.
         It was still the same big Manor.
         However, there were many more people now. A group of experts from the northern provinces had gathered.
         There were many three suns.
         As LAN Yue was speaking, Zi Yue, who had nothing to do, suddenly said,""Someone just sent a message. The base near tianlan Lake has been destroyed, and all the members are missing. There are traces of battle and blood on the scene!"
         "There are quite a few people in that base, right?" LAN Yue frowned slightly.
         "Quite a few. Four groups are over there."
         Four groups would mean 40 supers and four at the radiant sovereign level.
         This time, even with the help of all the red moon forces in the 19 provinces, Blue Moon could not hold it in any longer."So many people disappeared at once? If I'm not mistaken, there's also a peak stage sunlit cultivator ... Even if there's one of the three suns, they should be able to deal with him if they join forces, right?"
         Even he was a little heartbroken to see so many of his supers die at once.
         Who did this?
         As for disappearing ... Disappearing meant death. There was no need to fantasize about it. It was impossible to wait for them to return.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "The tianlan Lake base is not too far from the Hengduan Canyon," Ziyue said in a deep voice."The night patrollers have not been doing anything recently. Hao lianchuan was injured before and is now holed up in white moon City recuperating. Hou Xiaochen wouldn't go so far as to personally deal with moonlit darkness ... And according to our intelligence, there were a lot of footprints at the scene. It wasn't a single person, but a group, so they shouldn't be too strong ..."
         If there were really experts, there wouldn't be many people.
         "Flying heavens or Yama?"
         Ziyue asked again.
         In Silver Moon, only fairy and Yama had the confidence to take care of the 40 supers.
          As for the night watchmen, they had already confirmed that they had not gone out, so they were naturally not considered.
         In the main hall, there were a few three suns experts from other provinces who were extremely hot-tempered at this moment.""Fei Tian and Yama are really bold! Adding insult to injury, these guys are faster than the last ... Lady LAN Yue, why don't we find their base and take revenge! If we don't kill their pride, they'll think that Hongyue is easy to bully!"
         "That's right!"
         "Also, should we send someone to tianlan Lake to look for a few tracking supers? they might be able to find out that it only happened last night. Even if the other party escaped, they wouldn't be able to erase all traces so quickly!"
         At this moment, Hong Yue's Army was strong!
         A large number of supers had gathered at the Silver Moon, but in the end, one of their important bases had been destroyed. This made the three suns experts from all over the world extremely angry. Previously, everyone was a little upset that they had been targeted by some experts.
         Now that they had gathered at Silver Moon, they had come to seek warmth as a group, yet such a thing had happened in the end. How could they not be infuriated?
         LAN Yue's expression was also very ugly.
         These people were too bold.
         Red Moon was the number one faction in Silver Moon. No one dared to refute her claim, as she had close to a thousand superpowers!
        
         Three suns, there were more than ten of them here, and more people were coming.
         Just when he thought that no one would dare to provoke Hong Yue in a short time, he was hit in the head. It was a slap in the face.
         LAN Yue took a light breath, and her expression returned to normal.""Let's not jump to conclusions yet. It might not be Feitian or Yama ... Although the three major organizations are not one, it's not the time to fall out. Tianlan Lake base has been destroyed ... The other party can't be too weak. We still have to investigate. Jinjiu, Duan Chao, you two take a few supers who are good at tracking and go take a look ..."
         Zi Yue said,"to be able to destroy the tianlan Lake, the other party might also have three suns. There might be more than one. Although the two leaders are both at the three suns realm, once they encounter each other ... They might not be able to defeat the other party."
         LAN Yue nodded, but then shook her head and said,""We'll just investigate first. If there's really danger, we don't have to contact them. It's not good for too many people to leave our side. Hou Xiaochen and the other four organizations will meet again last night. I've received news that in the next two days, they'll organize an even more powerful purge. Hao lianchuan, Hu dingfang, Wang Henggang, and even the Wei Wu Army, which I've only heard of, will all join forces this time. We have to be prepared to deal with them. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Silver moon's officials began to move again.
         At this moment, too many of the three suns had been diverted away. If they were to encounter the Silver Moon officials, they would not have enough power to deal with them.
         "Then let's add one more," Zi Yue said."Three three suns will make it easier to deal with."
         LAN Yue pondered for a moment and nodded. He pointed to another person,""Zheng ping, you go with him!"
          In the crowd, an ordinary-looking man nodded his head. The others took a few more glances at him. This was one of the stronger three suns. He was in the late stage of the three suns.
         Of the previous two, one was at the early stage of three yang and the other was at the middle stage of three yang.
         ,m With a few words from Zi Yue, LAN Yue had gained another late stage three yang. Everyone was a little surprised. Although LAN Yue was Xu Guang, it seemed that she still respected Zi Yue.  Zi Yue was only at the peak of the three suns, but LAN Yue had to give her face when she asked.
         Three three suns, and one late stage. This time, Zi Yue didn't say anything. Even if these three encountered a peak three sun, they would be able to fight and even kill the other party.
         Unless he encountered the rising light, it wouldn't be a big problem.
         The destruction of the tianlan Lake base had come to an end.
         At this moment, they still had a lot of things to do. LAN Yue had gathered so many experts to Silver Moon not only for the heaven battling city ruins, but more importantly, to capture Li Hao!
         "The four organizations are working together, and I heard that the Wei Wu Army will also be participating. So, Li Hao went to the Wei Wu Army ..."
         LAN Yue's information was not bad. After saying a few words, he said,""Yesterday, it was said that two military trucks left the Wei Wu Army. Someone said that Li Hao brought people out to train, but last night, we investigated ... And found no trace of the Wei Wu Army."
         They also took it very seriously and went to investigate last night. However, they received news that the two cars were empty.
         As for the information he had received earlier, there was someone in the car, and he couldn't confirm whether it was true or not.  LAN Yue continued."We need to keep an eye on this side. However, we also need to create enough pressure for Silver Moon. If the Wei Wu Army really makes a move, we might be able to lure Li Hao out of the city!"
         The news that Li Hao had left the city was only a rumor. There was no concrete evidence that he had really gone out.
         Thus, LAN Yue hoped to suppress Silver Moon step by step. In the end, if the Wei Wu Army moved out, Li Hao would most likely leave the city. Even if he didn 't, now that they knew about the Wei Wu Army's base, once the Wei Wu Army left the city ... LAN Yue even had the intention to attack the base.
         That place was in the northern suburbs of white moon City and was very close to the moon sea. As long as they were fast enough, hou Xiaochen wouldn't be able to react in time even if he was in the city.
         The crowd also began to discuss. The fact that Red moon's main task was not heaven battling city, but Li Hao, was beyond many people's expectations.
         Although they all knew that the red moon clan valued the eight great families, many people still believed that the gathering of the red moon clan's experts from the northern province was for the ruins and to deal with hou Xiaochen.
         As for Li Hao, in the eyes of some people, he was still the one who had broken through a hundred levels and killed sun moxian.
         After all, it had only been less than a month since that incident.
         ……
         On the evening of September 16th.
          The Hengduan Canyon crossed the southern line and entered the northern side. In an abandoned town, dust and sand were swept up. The usually quiet abandoned town had a few more people today, and there was more laughter and laughter.
         The bonfire was burning high and exuberantly.
         The fragrance of the meat filled the air.
         It was the same as last night.
         They were afraid that others didn't know that there were a few rich kids on an outing here.
         The energy storage ring on Wang Ming's hand was particularly conspicuous under the light of the bonfire. He laughed loudly and said,"This place is good. It's quiet and has a special meaning! There's no need to worry about your safety. Who would dare to provoke us in Silver Moon? Even if it's the three major organizations, we don't need to be afraid. If they really touch us, can they bear the responsibility?"
         "If they touch us, the White Dragon Army will immediately declare war on them! My grandfather is not someone to be trifled with!"
         “……”
         His voice was very loud, and the three beautiful women in the group echoed him. They all began to boast about how powerful their families were and how high their status in the family was. They were out for a walk this time, and whoever dared to provoke them at this time would be courting death ...
        
         During the day, this group of people also swaggered through the city. Those who had their eyes on them would have noticed them long ago.
         In the darkness.
         On one side of the town, Li Hao stood on the roof of a dilapidated old house, looking around with a cold and sharp gaze.
         Wang Ming and the others were surrounded by superpowers!
         However, Li Hao frowned. These superpowers were probably lone wolves and not members of the three major organizations.
         Did they fail to attract the three major organizations this time?
         A moment later, shouts erupted in the distance. Some superpowers couldn't take it and wanted to launch a sneak attack, but they were quickly discovered by Wang Ming and the others, who quickly fought. In the dark, one of them shouted,"Brothers nearby, let's go together and kill these fat sheep. We'll split the benefits equally!"
         Soon, a few more supers appeared and joined the battle. One of them was in the sun glory realm.
         Li Hao just watched and didn't interfere. He didn't care about their battle.
         In the dark, Wang Ming's voice was very loud, arrogant and angry. "You're quite bold to attack me. It's not a bad idea to kill you and get some mysterious energy!"
          Boom! Boom! Boom!
         The sound of battle spread far and wide.
         At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered. He looked in one direction. A few hundred meters away from the battle, a small ball of light vaguely appeared, very conspicuous in the darkness.
         Li Hao laughed!
         This was more in line with the style of the three major organizations. Although the large organizations were arrogant and despotic, they would usually do some investigations in case it was a trap.
         The superpowers from before had appeared out of the blue, which was not in line with the style of the three major organizations. Hence, Li Hao concluded that they were lone wolves.
         But now ... It was somewhat in line with their style.
         Which of the three major organizations had come?
         Li Hao's figure flickered as he watched.
         As for the ball of light, after silently observing it for a while, it also quickly disappeared. Li Hao quickly chased after it in the dark. After chasing it for several kilometers, Li Hao's eyes lit up. There were so many balls of light!
         There were at least 20 of them, and there were still no three suns among them. They were all Dark Moon and sunlight, but there was no red shadow, so they might be flying sky or Yama's people.
         ……
         Half an hour later.
         The battle began.
         Tonight's demon hunt squads were a lot more powerful than yesterday 's, and their cooperation was much better. Although there were still a lot of problems, these martial masters were rapidly digesting them and improving themselves.
         Their opponents were a group of people whose faces were painted with oil paint. These people were the Yama's men.
         Fairy liked to wear cloaks, Red Moon liked to wear masks, but Yama did not have any strict requirements. However, Yama had many superpowers and liked to paint themselves to show that they were different from the rest. At the same time, it also revealed their identity to the public. The three major organizations all had their own characteristics.
          At this moment, apart from Li Hao, even Liu Long had gone to fight.  This time, the quality of the Yama's side was pretty good. There were quite a few sunlit realm cultivators. Liu Long had only recently entered the thousand-face realm and could match the middle stage of the sunlit realm. At this moment, he also went to participate in the battle to increase his experience of fighting with the sunlit realm.
         The battle between the two sides was still a little chaotic.
         The rumbling sounds continued.
         More and more Black Phoenix were sent flying, but soon, more and more Black Phoenix rushed up. A few small teams even started to practice their ten ring Mountain sealing formation. Liu Yan led her team members to kill a mid-stage sunglory super.
         Although their cooperation was not very good, within ten minutes of the battle, Liu Yan had gathered the inner strength of ten people and stabbed her two daggers into the heart of her opponent, ending his life.
         On the other side, Hong Qing and Liu Yan had made different choices. She was also forming a formation, but she was not gathering power alone. Instead, 10 swordsmen attacked at the same time. Sword Qi crisscrossed, and the earth-overturning sword appeared, turning the sky and earth upside down!
         The ground was directly torn apart by the joint attack of the 10 people, and the sunlit man who was surrounded in the middle was also instantly torn apart!
         With the sunlit King being killed one after another, the Yama King's side was quickly defeated.
         From the crowd came the wild cheers of some martial masters.
         Compared to last night, they were much stronger in the second Battle. In addition, they had seen the power of the array, which made them even more ecstatic and their morale was high. Among the three ten decapitation realm cultivators who failed to advance last night, one of them had directly released his inner strength during the battle and completed the advancement.
         The massacre continued for a while. As Liu Long's nine waves stacked up, he exploded with his strongest attack and chopped the late-stage sunlight glory expert to death with a single axe strike. The battle was completely over.
         Cleaning up the battlefield and collecting mysterious energy ...
         Now, everyone could already do it.
         The corpses of the dead would be moved away, buried somewhere, and the mysterious energy within their bodies would be collected. These corpses had no use, and the later they were exposed, the more time the demon hunt squads would have.
         "Demon hunting!"
         Following Liu Long's concluding shout, in the next moment, the entire demon hunt squad was filled with shouts.
          "Demon hunting!"
         This time, Li Hao didn't need to give any orders. The team leaders quickly led their teams away, looking for a place to hide for the night, and waited for tomorrow night's next attack.
         With two great victories and a great harvest, everyone was overjoyed.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The fact that the small team had killed sunlight by themselves made all the martial masters even more excited. Under the battle of chiliocosm, martial masters were not as good as superpowers. This time, it seemed like they had overpowered them.
         ……
         And as demon hunt squads became more active in various places, killing members of the three great organizations ...
         Over the past four days, more than a hundred supers had died and gone missing. At that moment, the entire Silver Moon was in a state of turmoil.
         ……
         In the cave.
         Banshan said coldly,"Fei Tian, we've lost a branch!" 17 supers are all missing, and missing means death ... Not only US, but Red Moon and Yama also have branches missing. According to the information, it might be done by martial masters. This reminds me of one person ... Li Hao!"
        
         When Li Hao left the Wei Wu Army, Fei Tian was the first to receive the news.
         But then, Li Hao disappeared.
         "There's another piece of information ..." Banshan continued."The grandson of the White Dragon Army's vice Commander-in-Chief has been traveling around recently. The places they appeared ... Are not far from where the branch disappeared!"
         After four consecutive days, Wang Ming's group still entered the sights of the three great organizations.
         These guys had been showing off everywhere, and every time they appeared, it was not far from the place where their people had disappeared. This made people wonder if these guys were bait.
         Over a hundred supers had died in four days. It was a huge loss to any organization.
         Banshan exchanged a few words with that elder and quickly said,"I want to see blue Moon and King Pingdeng ... Perhaps ... It's the work of the missing Li Hao and his group!"
         In the dark, the elder said in a low voice,""What do you want to do?"
         "Encircle and annihilate the missing Wei Wu Army!"
         "They're active every day, killing supers as if they've gone mad. Other than Li Hao, I can't think of anyone else who would be so crazy. He's crazy ... Because his teacher is Yuan Shuo. His methods are exactly the same as Yuan Shuo 's, killing wherever he goes ... It's rare to see someone like this in Silver Moon all these years."
          Yuan Shuo!
         That's right, Yuan Shuo was the same. Wherever he went, he would kill. At this moment, Yuan Shuo had already crossed the North Sea. Now, all the experts in the central continent knew that Yuan Shuo from Silver Moon had entered the central continent and began his life as a devil!
         Yuan Shuo left Silver Moon and became famous throughout the dynasty.
         His disciple was not lonely and was leading a group of martial masters to kill the supers.
         In the dark, the elder was silent for a moment before saying,""Good! However ... Don't forget about those fellows in white moon City. There's been quite a bit of activity in white moon City these past few days. Be careful of hou Xiaochen's sudden attack!"
         "I know,"
         After Banshan finished speaking, he disappeared.
         Li Hao, it must be him!
         That guy was as crazy as his teacher.

         At the same time.
         Hou Xiaochen coughed and looked into the distance. After a long while, he laughed,"Are you ... Going to start the chaos? What a crazy little fellow!"
         Four days, according to the information he had received, hundreds of supers had died.
         In all these years, this was the first time that so many supers had died in such a short period of time, other than the last time they entered the ruins.
          More importantly, that fellow was also very powerful.  He was right!
         Wang Ming's bait had been extremely bold. He had actually dared to follow Li Hao for four days.
         "Silver Moon ... Isn't peaceful anymore!"
         Hou Xiaochen sighed. At first, the balance had been barely maintained, but Li Hao had gone out and broken the balance. Soon, Red Moon would receive the news. Li Hao and the others couldn't hide anymore.
         And next ... Was Li Hao's death.
         "I ... I'm only responsible for helping you hold back some experts. I can't hold back all of them ..." He said.
         He shook his head and looked at the secret room behind him. Before, he could ask Xiao Yu for help, but now, he had no choice. As for Li Hao ... He could do as he pleased.
         ……
         That night, no one was calm.
         That night, Li Hao knew that the real battle might not have started yet. In the past few days, he had seen the traces of the three suns, but he had been leading his team to avoid them.
         In the past two days, he had seen the three suns operation three times. Once, it was a group of three, and once, it was a solo operation. He did not do anything.
         He was afraid that if he made a move ... He would scare the others.
         It wouldn't be too late to make a move when there were more people.
          For four consecutive days, the endless killing, wasn't it to attract these guys?
         "I haven't made a move for a few days, and my hands are itching!"
         Li Hao chuckled and looked at the ball of light in the darkness. In the past few days, the team's cooperation had become more and more tacit. He didn't even have the chance to attack.
         Now, it seemed that the opportunity had come.
         "After tonight, perhaps ... I, Li Hao, will have a place in the land of Silver Moon!"
         Li Hao smiled as he looked at the few balls of light rising in the distance.
         These few days, he had deliberately left behind some clues. It seemed that the three parties were about to find him. The efficiency was not bad!
         "Six three suns ..."
         Li Hao scanned his surroundings. He was not in the same direction, but six three-sun clusters had appeared in different directions.
         After tonight, it would be very difficult to hide it from others.
