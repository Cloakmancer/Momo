As soon as he said that, everyone frowned.Lin Hongyu's voice was a little low."I think Li Hao might be coming back ... Of course, I'm not sure, but there's no way out now. Since they've caught up with us, it'll be difficult for us to get rid of the four venerable sovereigns!" The only way is to fight!"She looked at the two masters of the great Dao and asked,'is it difficult for the two of you to advance? Do you need a long time?"Qian Wuliang thought for a while and said,"in the last year, the energy in the world has been very dense after we communicated with chaos. We have all been doing well in our cultivation. In addition, some of us gave up on the full cultivation and chose to focus on it. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to level up ... But we need some time. We should be able to level up while running.""It's not difficult to advance. The key is ..."Hong Yitang said bluntly.He paused."After advancing to venerable sovereign, we will become monarchs. The great Dao universe will be bound to us!"There was a hidden meaning behind his words.In fact, the two masters of the great Dao had already met the conditions to advance to venerable sovereigns.However, neither of them had chosen to advance. Instead, they had been waiting for something. Even when the danger had arrived, they still seemed to be hesitating.Lin Hongyu knew what they were thinking.After advancing to venerable sovereign, he had absorbed the Dao into his body.Na what Dao?The great Dao!In the Dao universe, in the river of chaos.At that time, it would be very difficult to escape, and the price to pay would be very high.In the Dao universe, the two of them were no longer noobs. They more or less knew some things. How many venerable sovereigns and sixth-stage venerable sovereigns were coveting the Dao universe?And it was a dual-Dao universe!Li Hao was the true Overlord of Silver Moon. Although they had become Masters of great DAOs before ... Li Hao would probably know how rare and precious a great Dao universe was after he left.At this moment, if he advanced, he would be bound to the great Dao. What would he do when Li Hao returned?Although his River of Life and death was not bad, strictly speaking, it was far from having greater potential than the Dao universe at this stage. He also had the help of tens of thousands of people to cultivate. It could be said that countless peak stage six experts were drooling over such an opportunity.The two of them had delayed for a year. In fact, not long after the great Dao universe and chaos came into contact, the two of them had a chance to advance.But later, the power of a great Dao allowed the Heaven's Fate to advance, and neither of them advanced by themselves.Hong Yitang wanted to return it to Li Hao, but Qian Wuliang ... Was really worried.Although Li Hao had only been a first stage venerable sovereign when he left, he had advanced to the next level. Both of them knew that it was extremely difficult to advance to the next level in the chaos. Li Hao might still be a first stage venerable sovereign now ... There was a high chance that he would still be.After all, it had only been a year!But ... She was afraid.Li Hao came back and felt that Hong Yitang was his close relative, but he was not. What if he was killed?He was conflicted!Therefore, even though they were in great danger, the two of them were still in a dilemma.Lin Hongyu frowned and quickly made a decision.""I'll immediately advance! Don't think too much about it. If he wanted it, he would have taken it away long ago. If he didn't take it away, it meant that he didn't want it ... Didn't martial uncle Hong know him? "His mind isn't in the Dao universe. Moreover, the situation is critical now. If we don't advance, we'll die, the world will be gone, and the Dao universe will be gone ..." Hong Yitang coughed dryly."It's hard to say. These venerable sovereigns can't take away the great Dao universe. He might be able to rush back soon ..."Bullshit!Lin Hongyu was furious,"level up, now!" In his eyes, the Dao universe is not as important as your lives. He will only be angry when everyone dies. Advance immediately, without any delay!"The two looked at each other. Seeing Qian Wuliang keeping silent, Hong Yitang knew that Qian Wuliang didn't dare to say anything, so he nodded and said,""Alright, we'll immediately advance!"In the next moment, the two of them disappeared, and Qian Wuliang let out a sigh of relief.It has nothing to do with me! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Hong Yitang took the initiative to respond to Lin Hongyu's order, so I was the passive one ... I said the same thing when Li Hao came back.After the two of them disappeared, Heaven's Fate grumbled,""I'm only rank one!"Why didn't you ask me?I'm a Tier 1, can I fight a Tier 2?"Senior, you've been a venerable sovereign for a long time. When your clone advanced, your control over your power is also top-notch!""Senior, you're an experienced venerable sovereign ..." Lin Hongyu said with a serious face.Heaven's Fate rolled his eyes. 'That's right, I'm considered a veteran. More importantly, all the venerable sovereigns in the primal Chaos are more veteran than me. Do you think I'm comparable to Silvermoon?'Which venerable sovereign in the primordial chaos isn't older than me?How many years have I been a venerable sovereign?But now ..."Besides, senior is only a clone. If you die, then you die!"Was this still considered human?Celestial pole was extremely depressed.This was simply inhumane!The clone was not a human?The clone wasn't life? This clone of mine has been independent for a hundred thousand years, and has long since developed its own style ... Although its style is the same as my true self 's, I feel that I'm also an independent person.Although he thought about it, he also knew that no egg could remain intact when the nest was overturned.If silver Moon was defeated, his clone would not have a good ending either.He could run away ... But the point was, wasn't Zhang an still here?I've lost Zhang an and ran away. I'll let it go in the past, but now that Silver Moon has connected with chaos, I've abandoned little Zhang. If old Zhang finds out, both my clone and main body will be in trouble."As for wandering the primordial chaos ... Forget it. With my personality, I'd rather find a place to lie down. A wandering life isn't what I want."Hong Yitang and his wife are so timid. Li Hao is gone, and they're still worried that he'll find trouble ..."

"I'm not a coward!"Lin Hongyu shook her head."That's because he hopes that Li Hao can use the Dao universe to reach a higher level. Only then can Silver Moon stand in the chaos!" Uncle Hong and Qian Wuliang both think that they can't do it. ""That's true!"At this moment, the two of them still had the time to chat, so they were not as panicked as they had imagined.Silvermoon knew that there would be a lot of trouble as soon as he left the primordial chaos.He would have to experience it sooner or later, so he didn't have much worry.As for the Black Panther, it moved its body silently and didn't say anything. It was also very quiet now and was just stalling for time. It would be best if it could escape. If it couldn 't, it would wait for Hong Yitang and the other person to vindicate Dao before attacking together.……Behind them.The venerable sovereigns were all delighted. Silver Moon had nowhere to run.They also knew that there were two venerable sovereigns in Silvermoon.However, a rank one and a rank two couldn't do anything.The Crimson Moon world had offered a very high price.A middle-level world was the minimum requirement. Besides, if they could take down the Silver Moon, they could even join the Crimson Moon world. The Crimson Moon world was almost full of venerable sovereigns, but it was said that several positions had been vacated recently ... Someone had been killed.For example, Li Hao had killed two red Moon sovereigns.New martial also killed several venerable sovereigns.The empty seats could be entered by others.Therefore, now that there were seats left in an eighth-level great world, it was not just a matter of who would take down the Silver Moon. They could also join the eighth-level great path universe. If they took down the third-level great path and devoured the medium-level world, the fourth-level great path universe was almost certain.If he joined the great Dao universe, a level six ... It would be difficult now, but the future was almost certain.For the venerable sovereigns, such an opportunity was too rare.Moreover, the risk wasn't high.At this moment, in the chaos, several venerable sovereigns were transmitting messages,""Block them and don't let them escape again. Also, make sure you don't make any noise and move quickly. This place is not far from the Crimson Moon world. If the people of the Crimson Moon get there before us ... We'll have nothing to do with it!""It's said that there are red moon's venerable sovereigns nearby who are looking for Silvermoon ... You guys, a great opportunity is right in front of you. You must not miss it!""I'll deal with the Beast of Chaos. You guys deal with the first stage venerable sovereign. There might be other unexpected factors ..."The venerable sovereigns quickly divided the work.Their eyes were filled with excitement.Even if it wasn't an equal share, it was still a huge opportunity.According to the previous agreement, if they seized the Silver Moon and it was difficult to distribute it, they would exchange it for Dao crystals. In short, they would all be rich.Of course, they had worked together many times before. Otherwise, they wouldn't have dared to join forces.After all, the fewer people he had, the more opportunities he would have. In the next moment, the venerable sovereigns increased their speed. The two third stage venerable sovereigns were even faster as they moved to block Silver moon's path. They could not let this piece of fat meat escape.At the same time.Inside the Silver Moon.At the moment, the entire world was in a state of alert. Everyone was training and ready to cooperate at any time. The Silvermoon people also knew that after entering the chaos, danger would be everywhere. Therefore, when the two masters of the great Dao appeared and everyone was required to cooperate, there was almost no need for any preparation.This was not the first time.10,000 beams of light instantly converged.At this moment, the two long rivers of the great Dao surrounded the entire Silver Moon like a Tai Chi. The two masters of the great Dao had no scruples at this moment and chose to verify their Dao and become emperors today.The current Silver Moon had been away for a year, but his strength had increased rapidly.Today, the number of Dao integration cultivators had even broken through two digits and was approaching three digits.It had only been a year!Compared to other experienced worlds, it was naturally far inferior. However, the Silver Moon world was only an unrated world previously. This speed was already unimaginable. This was also the advantage of the Dao universe.Everyone's cultivation was organized and logical.In addition, Li Hao had previously made his own mantras public and given the bright moon sword to the people for them to comprehend. The Silver Moon people were actually very happy ... Of course, while they were happy, they also lost some of their own comprehensions.It was more of Li Hao's understanding. Li Hao learned from the ancients, and they learned from Li Hao, so there might be similarities in the Dao.However, not everyone could walk their own path.Reaching the Dao integration stage was no easy feat.As the people gathered the power of the great Dao, the two rivers of the great Dao began to fluctuate rapidly.The master of great Dao, the weakest master of great Dao at present, was probably at the sixth rank. These two masters of great Dao were not even venerable sovereigns, which was unprecedented.In the next moment, the river of the path rippled.The power of a great Dao spread across the world.Two huge figures appeared in the river.The two of them merged with the river, absorbing tens of thousands of DAOs into their bodies.The river of the truth Dao universe was slightly stronger than the river of the void Dao universe, but it was only relative.Nowadays, many people cultivated Phantom path, and most of them were experts.As the power of the great DAOs merged with the river and into their bodies, it was almost natural for them to advance to venerable sovereign.Not long after, a loud boom resounded through the world! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  A sovereign's Taoist connotation spread in all directions.On the side of the truth Dao universe, Hong Yitang was the first to break through the barrier and enter the long river, stepping into the venerable sovereign level. The momentum of the earth merged with the heaven and earth. Although he controlled ten thousand DAOs, he still walked the sword Dao that was most suitable for him, earth momentum kun, earth-covered sword!At this moment, in the Silvermoon world.

Chapter 2722 A Refined Man Killing People (3)
Some were envious, some were jealous.There were also people who looked disdainful, such as Yuan Shuo, who muttered,""Not much!"The old man was a little jealous.Of course, he was also disdainful ... Even if he pretended to be disdainful, it was still disdainful.Although he was a Dao integration expert now, he was still far from being a venerable sovereign. However, he had no choice. His Dao was still in the great Dao universe. The master of the great Dao had just become a venerable sovereign, so he could forget about it.To the side, hou Xiaochen and the others all laughed.They knew that danger lurked everywhere. The two of them had chosen to vindicate their Dao at this moment, so they must have encountered a difficult crisis, but ... What else could they do other than laugh?They were only at the Dao integration realm. It would be troublesome for them to leave the world and encounter chaos, let alone fight venerable sovereigns.He could only pretend that he didn't know. Yuan Shuo sighed,"that disciple of mine ... He's been gone for a year, and there's been no news of him!" Seeing that the earth overturning sword and gan Wuliang vindicated their Dao one after another, we're still in the midst of Dao integration ... I wonder when we'll be able to wander around the primal Chaos. "Hou Xiaochen coughed lightly and chuckled."What, you're still not giving up?""Give up?"Yuan Shuo sneered,"why should I give up?" Although he couldn't catch up for now, it didn't mean he couldn't catch up for life! Even if I can't become the master of all DAOs and become a venerable sovereign, I'll become a venerable sovereign sooner or later! So what if it was only the five-element Dao? The primordial chaos is so vast. Can't one be considered an expert if they walk the five elements?""In new martial arts, besides the human King, didn't the Supremes, the sun god, and the blood Emperor also walk their own paths? just because they aren't the Masters of the great Dao, they can't do it?"He would not give up!He then looked at the Silver Moon martial masters around him and said in a loud voice,""Don't compare yourself to my disciple, you can't compare! For example, those venerable sovereigns in new martial arts wouldn't be compared with human Kings ... They were not comparable, but they were more than enough! We can't say that because Li Hao is strong, we can just sit around and wait for death!""Now, the Dao master of the Dao universe has advanced to venerable sovereign ... This is our chance! Now that they've become venerable sovereigns, there's a lot of people who cultivate alone. If we open a branch, we'll have a chance of becoming venerable sovereigns ..."Of course, they could only hope that the two Dao Masters were only at the first stage, and it would be difficult for them to become great emperors.Under normal circumstances, the limit of a world was a Dao master.It was too difficult for them to become Dao emperors at the first level.When a Dao master was at level two, they had the hope of vindicating their Dao and becoming an Emperor ... However, this situation was rare. Under normal circumstances, the Lords of a major world were at Level Seven. As for level six, most of them were later successors.Without the power of the sixth step, it would be difficult to even inherit it."Yuan Shuo, the master of the great Dao is only at level one," someone asked."It's difficult for us to vindicate Dao ... Lin Hongyu hasn't vindicated Dao yet either. Is it because Li Hao is only at level one ..."Lin Hongyu had yet to vindicate her Dao. Everyone guessed that it might have something to do with Li Hao's River of Life and death being too weak.This was also an existence similar to the great Dao universe.Of course, it was even smaller. Yuan Shuo shook his head."I'm not too sure. But it's mainly because Li Hao hasn't returned yet. I don't think it'll be a problem for Lin Hongyu to vindicate her Dao after he returns ... I don't believe that Li Hao won't be able to reach level two after going out for a while!"It had only been a year.Although everyone knew that a year in the chaos was nothing! And it was normal for Li Hao to make no progress, he firmly believed that Li Hao was at least at stage two!That disciple of mine is a natural-born monster.What's the problem with rank two?Everyone could only look forward to it.At that moment, someone looked up at the sky and said nothing. They couldn't see anything. They were all inside the world. Furthermore, the outside of the world was covered by the Black Panther's body. They couldn't see chaos at all.However, Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang had successfully advanced to the next level. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  He didn't even say a word and ran away.Clearly, a crisis had arrived.Everyone knew very well that they must have been attacked by venerable sovereigns outside, but they really couldn't do anything.Yuan Shuo saw that everyone was a little dejected and suddenly said,""It's okay. They don't like us and won't tell us ... We'll do what we need to do. I'll call on the cultivators of the five elements to form a five birds killing array with me! We won't go out either ... But if someone comes in, we'll trap them with a formation. I hope a venerable sovereign can come in and kill them!"He chuckled and did not look nervous at all."The bone erosion that trapped Hong Yue in the past is gone now. The eight major cities and stargates are gone, but we're all powerful now. A group of Dao integration cultivators can form a large array. In our own territory ... There's a chance of killing a venerable sovereign!"Even though the crowd felt that their chances were slim, and that it was unlikely that they would stand a chance if their defenses were breached, they still heeded Yuan Shuo's words and went to make their preparations.More or less, it would give him some comfort.……And within the primordial chaos, a battle soon began.As the two Dao Masters advanced, a battle between venerable sovereigns broke out outside.As the battle broke out, the two third level venerable sovereigns 'eyes had changed completely. They were filled with endless greed and madness!The great Dao universe!The Dao River!The new Great path universe was simply unbelievable and unimaginable.When the two Dao Masters came out and merged into one, the long river of the great Dao was formed. The venerable sovereigns knew that this time, it might not be something that a medium-level world could compare to.It was the great Dao universe!Under his madness and greed, he was also extremely afraid. He was not afraid of these people, but he was afraid that someone would pass by and the Crimson Moon experts would rush over.

Chapter 2723 A Refined Man Killing People (3)
Once they discovered that there was a new universe of the great path here, they would have no chance.He was lucky that he was not killed.A new Dao universe was almost destined to have another level Seven in the future. It might take time, but everyone could afford to wait! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  At this moment, the two third level venerable sovereigns seemed to have realized something.This great Dao universe ... Seemed to be similar to the yin-yang universe, where two Dao Masters could appear.They were both 3rd rank ... Maybe ...The two of them even had the thought of killing him to silence him.If he didn't know that it would be difficult to kill someone at the same level as him, he would definitely take all the benefits for himself!However, at this moment, the two of them had similar thoughts. Since they couldn't take it all for themselves, the two of them would split it. It might be good to have two less people to share. As for the other two ... Don't even think about it.Such thoughts and greed were quickly taken advantage of.Qian Wuliang was an expert in this field.He had merged with Hong Yitang. Although he couldn't defeat a stage three expert, he could still hold them back. At this moment, a special power of the great Dao started to spread around, affecting these venerable sovereigns. The power of greed, fear, and envy began to spread in all directions.They only hoped that the venerable sovereigns would have internal strife.Otherwise, Heaven's Fate would not have been able to hold on, let alone Lin Hongyu. Although she was a life-and-death cultivator, she was not a venerable sovereign. A life-and-death cultivator was not that impressive. She was badly suppressed by a first stage venerable sovereign.If it wasn't for the appearance of the great path universe, which moved the venerable sovereign, he would have been killed.Venerable sovereigns weren't stupid. They knew that with the appearance of the great Dao universe, the two of them, one stage one and the other stage two ... Might be repelled by the two stage three experts. Therefore, they held back a little.He hoped that both sides would suffer great losses. Otherwise, neither the celestial pole nor Lin Hongyu would have the chance to defeat an upper-level cultivator!Just like that, even though Silver Moon was lacking quite a bit, he still managed to maintain a strange balance in the battle.The stage three expert who was dealing with Black Panther hoped that the other expert would be able to injure the two Dao Masters. The other expert hoped that Black Panther would be able to injure the other expert. On the other hand, the two of them hoped that the battle would end quickly so that the other two would not play any tricks.All of a sudden, the battle was not as brutal as he had imagined.All kinds of thoughts appeared in their minds, which were also related to Qian Wuliang's ability.……At the same time.On the other side of the chaos.Li Hao frowned slightly.Within the river, a life and death Star was fluctuating violently, indicating that the other party was in a state of combat. This meant that Silvermoon was already fighting someone.His River of Life and death was actually a weaker version of the great Dao universe.If it was a powerful universe, it could even cover the entire area. It could directly use the universe to quickly descend there or give Lin Hongyu more energy.But at this moment, it was obviously not possible. Li Hao was not that powerful."At this speed ... I'm afraid it will take at least half a day to a day." Li Hao glanced at the venerable sovereigns around him. They were not moving fast.At the moment, they were quite far away and could not sense any aura fluctuations, so they did not know that Silver Moon was fighting with the other venerable sovereigns.In a battle between powerhouses, half a day's time would be too late!What to do?There were quite a few venerable sovereigns here. In addition, were there any venerable sovereigns following him in secret?Moreover, a level four venerable sovereign was not weak. Li Hao had the confidence to fight a level four venerable sovereign now. More importantly, it would not be a short battle. If there were still other venerable sovereigns in the dark ... If they were powerful, he had nothing to borrow.This was not tianfang.It was not as if there were ruins everywhere in the chaos. Of course, since he dared to come out and act with a rank four venerable sovereign, he must have some confidence. For example, he was suppressing a rank five corpse in the river ...Turning back time, a fifth rank venerable sovereign, it's not a matter of whether you lend me your power or not, it's a matter of whether I can simply enter your position.However, it would be troublesome if there were those above grade 5 in the dark."Perhaps ... No one is following us. After all, according to their thinking, we haven't even reached the Crimson Moon Area yet. It's still too early to meet Heaven's Fate and the others ..."Then, he looked at the venerable sovereigns around him ... They were not that annoying.Kill them?As various thoughts crossed his mind, Li Hao suddenly said,""Emperor Ming Hao!"In front of them, the fourth stage venerable sovereign turned his head and looked at them. He was a little confused. What was he doing?He was still polite to Li Hao.He was a friend of the Crown Prince of the great world. How could he not be polite?"Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, what's the matter?""It's like this. I actually lied to you, fellow Daoists ..."Li Hao said softly.Everyone was stunned. What did he mean?Li Hao continued,'actually, I'm also half a master of a Dao universe ... Similar to fellow Daoist Kong Ji. "It's just that my side is actually an alliance with neo martial ..."Everyone was dumbfounded.What the hell did he mean? "It's like this," Li Hao said."I want to recruit you on behalf of neo martial and the light world!"Li Hao said sincerely.He felt that these individual cultivators were not too bad. Everyone had their own Masters. Neo martial arts was too lazy to incorporate them, and he didn't care."The benefits that the Crimson Moon world will give you are nothing more than some small worlds or taking you into the Crimson Moon world ... These, my neo martial and Guild of light can also give you!"Li Hao's face was serious."Moreover, there are too many people in the Crimson Moon Alliance. There are also many itinerant cultivators. 90% of the experts in the tianfang world support the Crimson Moon ... Do you really not trust the neo martial artists who destroyed the two worlds?"

"Speculation ... I think that sometimes, gambling is also a big thing! On behalf of neo martial, I'll use another great path universe to secretly recruit you. I wonder if you're interested?"“……”Minghao was stunned.F * ck!What was the meaning of this?We went to hunt for neo martial artists, and now you're telling me you want to take us in?What a joke! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  The referee was also completely dumbfounded. He looked at Li Hao. What was the meaning of this?"Actually, everyone understood, didn't they?" Li Hao quickly said.Minghao's expression turned unsightly. F * ck!His head had exploded!Here ... There were new martial arts 'spies.艹!More importantly, this person's identity was extraordinary. This ... This was going to blow up. The great world of light was involved. Li Hao was a good friend of the Son of God of light.They were going crazy!We're just taking people's money and helping them get rid of disasters.They hadn't met any new martial artist powerhouses yet, but Li Hao was going to take them in. Also, the power struggle involved in this made them a little scared.Killing Heaven's Fate and King Huai was just a small matter.In the war of the great world, a low-level venerable sovereign was nothing.However, it was obvious that Li Hao's side was not involving low-level venerable sovereigns.The Son of God of light was involved!Moreover, it seemed to represent another macro world, not the neo martial world or the great radiance world.What the hell is this?Even though they knew that the other party might be the spokesperson of neo martial arts, at this moment, none of the 11 venerable sovereigns dared to move or make a move, even if the person in front of them was only a first level venerable sovereign!Minghao's expression was a little stiff,"fellow Daoist, You must be joking!" This time, we ... We're going to hunt the two venerable sovereigns of new martial arts ... Fellow Daoist, please don't joke around. If ... You're not willing, you can leave now. I won't stop you!"Li Hao chuckled,"they're just taking people's money and helping them get rid of disasters ... In that case, why don't you join neo martial arts?" What's the Difference?"Ming Hao was speechless.What was the difference?The difference was ... They didn't think highly of neo martial.Why?That was because there were no level eight venerable sovereigns in neo martial arts!However, what if the great radiance world was involved? However, it was said that the cloud world might also be eyeing neo martial ...They were a little confused.Because neo martial had never recruited from the outside world or formed an alliance with other parties, they had never thought of joining neo martial. Now, a person suddenly came and said that he wanted to recruit them and take them in ... This was simply a joke.Li Hao continued, fellow Daoists, my time is limited, and I'm very busy! What I'm worried about now is that there are still people following us. Although they're not nearby, there's a lot of movement here, so I'm worried that they'll come to take a look ... So, what I mean is that we should all be peaceful. If we can resolve this peacefully, then we shouldn't fight. ""If you don't want peace ... Then I'll have you surrounded!" He said seriously.“……”Minghao felt that this person had gone crazy.Crazy?Even the referee was shocked. What are you talking about?Li Hao said again,"I'm serious. I'm very tight on time. Fellow Daoists, we've been friends since we came here. Normally, I wouldn't ask more questions. Now, I'll give you another chance ... I originally wanted to go with you to find Heaven's Fate and the others, but I can't do that now! I'll ask you one last time, are you willing to be incorporated into our ranks?"Everyone was stunned.11 venerable sovereigns, one fourth rank, four third rank, three second rank, and three first rank.At this time, a first stage venerable sovereign told them, are you willing to be incorporated?If you don't want to, I've surrounded you!This was the funniest joke in the world!At this moment, Li Hao pointed at a person.""Fellow Daoist cloud dust, I know that you might be a spy from one of the factions ... Actually, it doesn't matter. Spies don't have human rights. If you're willing to be incorporated, I'm also willing to accept you! But ... Don't play any tricks. It's useless. If you do anything, I won't be polite!"Li Hao was still very serious."I'll give you one last minute. You can either agree or ... Die!"I'm on a tight schedule.It would be best if they could be incorporated. With a small movement, even if someone followed them, they would not notice anything.After all, this was chaos, and there was nowhere to hide.The person who came definitely wouldn't follow them around, as that would be too obvious.But if I'm not willing ... Silver Moon is starting a war, and I'm going to kill!"Haoyue!"At that moment, the referee could not help but say,"don't go crazy!" Don't talk nonsense, how can you be a neo martial cultivator ...""I'm not a neo martial cultivator. I said that neo martial and I are considered an Alliance!""Sister Zheng, are you willing to surrender?" Li Hao explained.He looked at the crowd and sighed,""From the looks of it, only radishes won't do, I want a big stick! Well, I'm just a first level venerable sovereign ... My words don't work, and I don't have any deterrent force. I just thought that it was fate that we traveled together for a month ..."At this moment, Li Hao moved.When I, venerable sovereign Ming Hao, was still in shock, everyone's vision blurred and became a little dark. Time seemed to have stopped for a moment.Li Hao, who was at stage three, found it difficult to deal with experts.But here ... They were a group of weaklings. Even if they were at the 4th rank, they weren't too strong.For a moment, except for Ming Hao, who was still able to think smoothly, the others seemed to have stopped for a moment. The next moment, a sword appeared, and the power of life and death emerged. A second stage venerable sovereign seemed to want to create some noise. An item appeared in his hand. It might be used for communication ... It was similar to fireworks in the dark. This was also the way to send messages in the chaos.

However, before he could take out his hand, a sword pierced through!360 rays of Starlight appeared, and life and death appeared. Life force was instantly extracted, and the aura of death instantly covered the entire opponent.In the blink of an eye, the light in the second stage venerable sovereign's eyes disappeared.In his body, the mark of the great Dao collapsed.It looked like it was about to explode, and the long river swept over!Li Hao was a life-and-death cultivator who wielded the river of life and death, which was similar to the Dao River, and had the help of the power of time. Even if he did not dare to use too much, the battle between a peak stage three and a stage two would be over in an instant!This was also the venerable sovereign he had warned before, but the other party didn't listen.The venerable sovereign disappeared in an instant.The other venerable sovereigns came back to their senses one after another. In fact, Ming Hao had come back to his senses earlier. At this moment, his expression had completely changed.A second level venerable sovereign ... Was killed in an instant!This person wasn't a rank one!Absolutely not! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Not to mention a first-tier, even a third-tier killing a second-tier would not be so smooth. It was too fast, so fast that no one could react.The 11 venerable sovereigns were instantly reduced to 10.Li Hao's winding river disappeared. He looked at the crowd, his expression no longer gentle, but rather solemn."Fellow Daoist cloud dust was not willing to cooperate, so I had no choice but to kill her! In the depths of the chaos, the death of a venerable sovereign was nothing. One minute is almost up. Fellow Daoists, you can choose now! This includes fellow Daoist Minghao. If fellow Daoist feels that you can deal with me, you can try. I'm only at the great circle of level three, not a middle-stage venerable sovereign!"艹!This is considered rank three?"You ... Are you really the new Martial Emperor?" Ming Hao's expression changed and he asked in a low voice."No, I said, the venerable sovereign of the neo martial alliance system!"Ming Hao didn't care. At this moment, he was only shocked and uneasy.In that case, hunting a neo martial artist's powerhouse, neo martial ... Knew!This was big trouble!His eyes flickered, but Li Hao said before he could speak,""Let's put it this way. I killed all six venerable sovereigns in the dark World! I've killed the two venerable sovereigns who nurtured the world! I've killed the four venerable sovereigns of the Tianhe zone! I've killed many venerable sovereigns, a few more won't make a difference ... It's really for the sake of our friendship, otherwise I wouldn't have said a word!""There are still 10 seconds left, please make your choice!"As he spoke, he waved his hand and a corpse appeared. A powerful pressure was still spreading.Minghao's body instantly stiffened!He recognized it!Not only him, but the others also knew him. An expert from The Dark World had recently joined the Dragon returning temple, and it had caused quite a stir.Dry!Tier 5!Oh my God!In just a moment, the venerable sovereigns 'foreheads were covered in sweat. Li Hao didn't speak much, but it was too horrifying.There were six venerable sovereigns from the darkest place, four from the Tianhe zone, and two from the Yunyang realm ...There were a total of 12 venerable sovereigns.One was at the fifth step, while the other was at the fourth step.In addition to the one just now ... There were a total of 13 venerable sovereigns! The others might still be in shock, but the judge and the other second stage venerable sovereign Chan Xiu's faces changed. In an instant, the two of them recalled the scene from a year ago. That day, the first stage venerable sovereign of Yunyang had only gone out for a trip ... And then disappeared.He was nowhere to be seen! At that time, he didn't think too much about it. Today, he finally understood.Li Hao had killed him!In just an instant, just like today, the other party had killed a rank two expert in an instant. It was terrifying.They all felt that he was not moving fast. They seemed to have seen it just now, but they were unable to stop him. With just one sword, the other party was killed in an instant. Was this killing a venerable sovereign?A Tier 3 killing a Tier 2, how could that be possible?Moreover, the other party even said that he killed a Tier 4 and Tier 5!The corpses of rank five venerable sovereigns were all here!This ...The referee swallowed his saliva and looked at Chan Xiu. Chan Xiu's expression changed slightly. In the next moment, before Ming Hao could say anything, Chan Xiu was a little scared,""I'm willing to surrender!"Chi also quickly said,"fellow Daoist Hao Yue, we're just doing what we're paid to do ... We haven't received the money from Hong Yue yet. We're just wandering in chaos. We're not enemies with new martial. I'm willing to surrender!"In an instant, the two venerable sovereigns chose to surrender.His life was his.Other than the middle-rank Ming Hao, who among the other venerable sovereigns was not afraid?It was too terrifying!The next moment, the other seven low-rank venerable sovereigns said,""I surrender!"“……”Minghao's expression was grave as he looked at Li Hao. At this moment, he was the only one who didn't speak.This trip ... Had simply ... Made him collapse.'What the hell is this?"You ... Are you really at the third rank?"Li Hao nodded and said, it's really at the third stage! 'Venerable sovereign of life and death can barely exchange blows with a fourth stage sovereign ... Venerable sovereign Ming Hao is very strong, and it won't be easy for me to take him down!' But I'm in a hurry. If it were any other time, I'd be willing to exchange pointers. Now, venerable sovereign Ming Hao doesn't agree, but I still have some means to deal with the venerable sovereign in an instant!"“……”艹!Since you've said so, should I believe you?If it was any other 3rd rank, I'd take it as you're farting.However, the person in front of him had taken out a rank five corpse and instantly killed a rank two. He was also on good terms with the Son of God of light ... If he said he didn't believe it, would he be dead?After cultivating to this level, he was also afraid of death!In fact, he was even more afraid of death!He actually wanted to show off his bravery. After all, he was a middle-stage venerable sovereign!But Li Hao suddenly said,"Time's Up. Since fellow Daoist has no choice ..."At this moment, Ming Hao felt the danger of death, the real danger of death!The force that had stopped venerable sovereign yunxu seemed to have reappeared. Although Ming Hao could still move, he could feel the immense pressure. In an instant, he was on the verge of collapse."I surrender!"

Chapter 2726 A Refined Person Killing People (8)
After he finished speaking, he was sweating all over.He was a little speechless.I just accepted a mission and didn't even see the target ... How could I surrender to a third stage venerable sovereign?What the hell was this?At this moment, Li Hao smiled."My fellow Daoists, you've made a wise choice. I'm not afraid of the other fellow Daoist betraying me, but fellow Daoist Minghao is too strong. I'm a little afraid that fellow Daoist would betray me ..."Minghao's expression changed slightly as he struggled,"Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, what do you mean?"Li Hao laughed."It doesn't mean anything. It's just what it means. Of course, I'm not a hypocrite. I'll just say it directly. In order to restrict fellow Daoist Minghao, I want to plant an eighth-grade sovereign weapon imprint in your body!" It's just a grade-8 sovereign weapon that can penetrate your Dao at any time ... It can lock onto you at any time. The owner of the sovereign weapon is very powerful ... Of course, it's not me!"The expressions of Ming Hao and the others changed.F * ck!An eighth-grade sovereign weapon?Where did this eighth-ranked monarch weapon come from?Even an eighth level venerable sovereign might not be able to forge an eighth level sovereign weapon!Even the Lord God of light didn't have an eighth-level Emperor weapon, right?Li Hao's situation was so complicated that no one could imagine it. He was also extremely shocked.Was there a powerhouse of the eighth step behind them?Who was it?Li Hao didn't say anything. A Phantom of a brand appeared in his hand. It was just a copy of the brand left by a chess move in the river. Li Hao said with a relaxed expression,""This is it. Fellow Daoist, show me the mark of your great Dao, and I'll put this imprint in! If fellow Daoist feels that this is inappropriate, you can refuse! Also, if the mark is too far away, even a level eight sovereign weapon might not be able to lock onto you ... Or you can find a level eight sovereign or even a level Seven sovereign to remove it. It won't have much of an effect. " Minghao took a look at The Phantom imprint, and with just one look ... He cursed in his heart!This imprint was only an illusion. With one look, he felt that there were countless DAOs, dazzling his eyes. He was a fourth stage venerable sovereign, so he had some insight.With just a single look, one could tell that even if it wasn't a grade 8 weapon, it was at least a Grade 7 Emperor weapon!At the very least, Li Hao had an advanced venerable sovereign behind him!What the hell, was a high-level venerable sovereign worthless?Everywhere?The next moment, he swallowed his saliva, gritted his teeth, and nodded.""Alright!"As for Li Hao, he looked at the others with a bright smile.""Don't worry, I won't do this to you. You're only low-stage venerable sovereigns ... I won't stop anyone who wants to leave ... I can kill low-stage venerable sovereigns with one sword strike!"No one made a sound.Was this disdain or ... Deterrence?"Perhaps it's just the truth. It's hard for me to kill those at the 4th rank, but I'm too lazy to restrict those below that. Whoever runs will die!For a moment, he heaved a sigh of relief, but also felt a little ... Sad.We don't even have the right to be restricted! At this moment, Ming Hao wanted to cry but no tears came out. It was an eighth-rank sovereign weapon's Mark. Perhaps an eighth-rank venerable sovereign was paying attention to him. He was only a fourth-rank sovereign, but he had so much face!Where am I going to find a high-level venerable sovereign to remove the mark?Do I dare to go and find it?Also, the neo martial world was too complicated. Not to mention the neo martial world, there was also the great radiance world, and behind Haoyue, there might be a level eight venerable sovereign ... It was too F * cking complicated.Why are you big shots fighting against us?How hard is it for us!Feeling like crying, he obediently showed his Dao mark. Li Hao casually threw the mark on his Dao mark and smiled.""It's just a replica of the brand. The real brand is with me. Yours can only be considered a second brand ... Run far away. Even a rank eight venerable sovereign might not be able to find you."Ming Hao grinned ... His smile was uglier than his crying face.Your words ... What do you mean?You want me to run?Or should you run? do you dare to run?I don't dare!"My Lord ...""Don 't, just call me Haoyue!"Li Hao's face was solemn."We're all venerable sovereigns. Don't be like this. The Lord's words are all jokes!" I'll take you to kill a few venerable sovereigns for fun. If we meet venerable Red Moon sovereign, we'll join forces to kill one as proof of our loyalty. This way, I won't be afraid of you running away. " Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  “……”Everyone was silent.The way he said it, it felt like they were really on a pirate ship.It would be fine if he did not kill Red Moon Emperor, but if he did ... He could only walk this path to the end!At this moment, even Yi wanted to cry but had no tears.This young man wasn't handsome at all. He suddenly felt that he really wasn't a good person!He pretended to be kind, but when he killed people, he was really terrifying!He killed Yun Xu with one sword ... Yun Xu was also very beautiful. Didn't you feel anything?But then again, this guy was indeed a refined man.When he killed people, his posture was also so refined.Methodically and gently, as if something had rolled up, a person died without any blood ... Bah, how could I think that?This was a terrifying demon Emperor!As for venerable sovereign Ming Hao, his eyes were filled with sorrow ...'I'm the one who's in trouble. I'm being targeted by a rank eight venerable sovereign!'

Chapter 2727 Unparalleled Killing (1)
Kill a person, intimidate them, and take in the rest.Li Hao was quite familiar with this.The reason why he had taken them in was that he was not strong enough. He could kill a rank four venerable sovereign, but he might face the primal Chaos lightning tribulation and attract the attention of the experts following him. It was not worth it.On the other hand, just as Li Hao had thought, these people were only wandering cultivators and Rangers. They weren't really a great enemy, and they might be of some help if they stayed.As for whether Ming Hao would believe the level 8 sovereign weapon imprint, whether he would run or fight back ... That would be up to him.This imprint was actually not of much use. It was just used to scare people.Li Hao wouldn't give away the real mark so easily. If used well, it could save his life and help him gain enlightenment. He couldn't bear to give it away for a mere fourth level venerable sovereign.After dealing with these people, Li Hao was no longer polite.A battle was bound to break out on Silver moon's side.Even a minute of delay could be a moment of life and death.However, the distance was indeed quite long...How could he travel quickly?"Senior Minghao!"Li Hao looked sincere."There's still some distance between this place and where I want to go. Senior, I'll have to trouble you to form your Dao marks and give us a ride!"“……”Ming Hao was speechless.In the chaos, the weak would always slow down the strong. So why didn't the strong take the weak with them?They were both venerable sovereigns, and neither of them had any face.The weak would feel embarrassed, while the strong would feel like they were being ridden.He would rather be slower!Of course, if there was a high-level monarch weapon, the kind that could be used as a means of transportation, then it wouldn't be a problem. But the point was, it was hard for rogue cultivators to even have an offensive monarch weapon, where could they find one that could help them travel?Li Hao's words ... In other words, he meant, senior, if you take out your Dao mark, let us ride you.In fact, it was quite humiliating.Unless the strong took the initiative to ask to bring you along, the weak had no right to mention this.But now ... The situation was different.Venerable sovereign Ming Hao was actually not too willing. He felt a little embarrassed and wanted to refuse, but he was also worried that he would really be killed. Was his face more important than his life?In the end, this fourth stage venerable sovereign still made his choice!The Dao mark turned into a small boat-like object, floating in the air.Li Hao looked at the other venerable sovereigns and said, everyone, let's attack together!When everyone heard this, they felt a little strange. They didn't dare to say anything and got on the boat one after another.Li Hao didn't board the ship. Instead, he walked in front and said,""I'll lead the way, you guys follow me. "He was a third level venerable sovereign, so his speed was not slow.Moreover, he was not just a third rank venerable sovereign, he only knew the way of life and death. The next moment, the river appeared. The moment it appeared, Li Hao arrived at the other end of the river in the blink of an eye. His speed was actually extremely fast, not slower than that of Thearch Ming Hao.On the ship, the venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed slightly.This thing ... Why did it look so much like the legendary Dao River?Yes, the river of Dao!If it were the powerhouses of the great world, they would actually be able to recognize it instantly. However, these people were all itinerant cultivators and did not know much about the great world. In addition, the path River was generally controlled by the path master, who was usually at Level Seven.They had never come into contact with a rank seven Dao master before.Although they had heard of him, they had never seen him before. Li Hao was only at the 3rd rank, and although they had their suspicions ... It was not a good time to ask, so they could only keep their doubts to themselves.Venerable sovereign Ming Hao was not slow. Although Li Hao was fast, the other party was able to keep up. It seemed that he had not used all his strength.A fourth stage venerable sovereign was still slightly stronger than Li Hao.Li Hao might be able to put up a fight, but it would be too difficult to defeat or kill a stage four without external help.At the venerable sovereign level, it was already hard to imagine being invincible among the same rank.There was still a barrier between the initial stage and the intermediate stage. Very few people could do this. Those who could do it, without exception, had to borrow some external power.The group of 11 people moved very quickly and disappeared in the blink of an eye.After they had left for a while, a shadow appeared at the place where they had just stopped.The person looked into the distance and frowned slightly.There were some explosive fluctuations in this place.Was there a battle?However, he didn't notice much movement, or was it just that they were in a hurry and someone tried out a move or something?If a battle really broke out between the 12 venerable sovereigns, it would not be so peaceful.As he thought about this, he looked in the direction that everyone had left.Then, he looked around.Ming Hao and his group had gone to hunt for new martial artists. This time, killing Heaven's Fate and King Huai were not the goal. It was to fish. Naturally, they were not the only ones. To some people, this group of people was just bait.There would naturally be people following them!However ... At this moment, the expert following him was also a little hesitant. There was no other reason. There was an additional Supreme Emperor Hao Yue in the crowd, and the other party had some connections with the divine light plane. This was very troublesome!He came from the great cloud world. Although they had not started a war with the divine light plane, they had some conflicts. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  It was fine if he was just a minor character, but right now, Haoyue was involved with the Lord God of light's only son.The heir to the world of light!Once these people were involved ... The two worlds that had not started a war would go to war because of this, and he would not be able to bear the responsibility.After thinking for a while, the other party didn't think about it anymore.Let's solve the problem with neo martial first.Soon, the powerhouse followed again, but not too close. It was fine as long as he made sure the other party was within a certain range. If he was too close, the neo martial artists were not idiots. At that time, they might be hooked by the neo martial artists.

Chapter 2728 Unparalleled Killing (2)
As long as he could determine the location of Heaven's Fate, King Huai, and the others, he would not lose them.……At this moment, Li Hao was accelerating.Behind him, Minghao and his men followed.Li Hao guessed that someone was following them. If he could ... Or rather, if Ming Hao and the others were trustworthy, the best solution was for them to go the other way while he, Ming Hao, or a few venerable sovereigns, went to deal with Silver Moon.Unfortunately, these people could not be trusted at all.Right now, he could only bring them to Silvermoon as quickly as possible to finish off his opponents and leave with Silvermoon. As for who was behind them, they were either from tianfang forces like Huilong temple or some powerhouses from the tianfang region.In terms of strength, it would not be an advanced level.At most, it would be at the sixth step!High-level venerable sovereigns were all strategic experts. They were used to guard a great world. They rarely went out unless it was time for a decisive battle. Otherwise, once they left the scope of a great world and lost the support of a great world, they would be killed by the enemy if they were not at their peak and were schemed against or ambushed ... It would be a pity.However, he was definitely stronger than Minghao.Li Hao didn't need to think to figure this out.As he hurried on his way, he was thinking about these things. Being followed by someone all the time ... Was not a good thing.However, he had no way to deal with a sixth level venerable sovereign.Even if he borrowed strength, he could only borrow the strength of a Grade 5 dry drought. He couldn't deal with a Grade 6 and would instead cause countless problems.He had thought that he would not have to deal with level five or six venerable sovereigns if he followed this group of people.But now it seemed like ... He still had to shake off the other party.He glanced behind him from the corner of his eye. Ming Hao was a Tier 4 ... It was not a good thing to keep him around. Perhaps he could be discarded after he was done using him ... He let them take the people behind them and leave.Of course, Li Hao didn't really care if this guy would never return.As for what he exposed, it didn't matter.In the tianfang world, he had a decent friendship, but he was just an empty one.However, the other party was a level eight venerable sovereign, so you could go and find trouble with him!Li Hao's thoughts kept flashing.At this moment, Ming Hao was a little nervous because he felt Li Hao's gaze. Although he was a fourth level venerable sovereign, he still felt that the person in front of him was too mysterious.Who was the other party?When he was asked if he was a neo martial artist, he said no, he was from the Alliance ... Besides neo martial artists, he was not from the divine light plane, so which great world did he come from?Half a master of the great Dao ... Could it be that he was also a second generation like Kong Ji?Which world Lord's descendant?This River-like thing was extremely fast. Could it also be a derivative of the Dao River?His knowledge was not bad, but he could not judge things like the Dao River. As for the Silver Moon King, at this moment, he really didn't think about it.If it was rank one, he would think so.Tier 3, forget it.The Silver Moon King had only left the Star Gate for a year, and the entire Silver Moon had only disappeared for over 50 years. How could there be a third stage venerable sovereign?The venerable sovereigns around him were also thinking about it.There were also people who wanted to escape.Of course, there were also real gamblers who were thinking ... If they could take a gamble?Previously, no one had bet on neo martial because neo martial didn't accept people. Otherwise, the neo martial human King would kill the Lord of Darkness, and the neo Martial Emperor Cang would destroy the Elysian world. Would it really not be worth the bet?Of course it was worth it!Unfortunately, you can't find a place to visit even if you want to.Now, it involved the divine light plane, a rank eight great world, so it was even more worth a gamble!These venerable sovereigns had complicated thoughts.As for the fact that they had instantly surrendered earlier, that was only because they knew how to adapt to the situation. They wanted to survive first before thinking about anything else. At their level, as long as they didn't die, what was the big deal about being your slave for thousands of years?The venerable sovereigns who could wander in the chaos and live to this day were all thick-skinned.He would only have a chance if he was alive!As they continued to move forward, suddenly, a venerable sovereign in the crowd said hesitantly,""As far as I know, the Silver Moon world has appeared recently, and it seems that a group of people has been following it. They even invited me before, but I didn't agree because I promised venerable sovereign Ming Hao. It seems that they are also in this direction ...""I know one of the people who are tracking him. Supreme Emperor smoked wind seems to be in his team."Was he going to Silver Moon?Killing Silver Moon would give them a medium-level world, and silver Moon was a subsidiary of new martial arts. Was venerable Emperor Hao Yue leading them to track down Silver Moon and save him?The venerable sovereigns weren't stupid. They had some guesses.As expected.At this moment, Li Hao turned his head and asked,'smoked wind? What's his strength?""Rank 3!"The venerable sovereign who had spoken said hurriedly,""They have a small team that's similar to ours ... It's just that we have a better relationship here, while they have fewer people, and they don't have a powerhouse like senior Minghao."Minghao knew a little more, and he said,"Aroma and the others? If it's them, I do know a little about them. This small team has four venerable sovereigns, two third rank, one second rank, and one first rank ... As for whether they have added other people, I'm not sure. ""I actually invited them before, but I was rejected. They probably thought that working with me would give them less benefits, so they might as well act on their own. Plus, the Silvermoon world isn't that strong, so they wanted to act alone ..."Four venerable sovereigns!There were still two 3rd rank experts! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao frowned and felt that something was amiss. Logically speaking, Silver Moon should not have been able to block it, but judging from Lin Hongyu's life and death Star, it was not to the point where he could not take it completely. Was a third level venerable sovereign that weak?

Chapter 2729 Unparalleled Killing (3)
Or could it be that ... For some reason, the other party did not go all out?The great Dao universe?A conflict?It was possible!As a result, he felt a little more at ease. It was only a low-rank venerable sovereign, not a middle-rank venerable sovereign. That was good.However, this place was not far from the Crimson Moon world.When the Silver Moon opened, he had killed a Red Moon sovereign. If nothing unexpected happened, someone from the red moon would definitely come here to investigate. However, a year had passed, and he did not know if the red moon still cared.If he cared, he had killed a third level venerable sovereign that day. If there was still someone waiting for him, it would be at least a middle level venerable sovereign!How troublesome!"Red Moon ..."Li Hao kept wondering if he could get Hong Yue's venerable sovereign and the venerable sovereigns following her together and cause some conflict.It would probably be difficult!The people who came later should also be here for new martial arts. The two sides were considered allies. It would not be so easy to kill a venerable sovereign in an instant. In this case, it would be a little difficult to create a conflict between the two sides.Let's not care about this and return to Silver Moon first!Li Hao sped up again, even vaguely using time acceleration, but it was very shallow. Since the two ends of the river were blocked, he did not have to worry about being targeted by the chaos lightning tribulation.His speed was getting faster!At this moment, Minghao's expression turned grave.This fellow's speed had seriously caught up to a rank four venerable sovereign!This was a third stage venerable sovereign? The difference between Tier 3 and Tier 4 was different from Tier 2 and Tier 3. The difference between the initial stage and the intermediate stage might seem to be only one tier, but in reality, the difference was huge. However, the other party's speed was actually able to catch up to his own, which was somewhat unbelievable.Before this, he had been suspicious of whether this person had really killed a fourth and fifth rank venerable sovereign. Now ... He was starting to believe it. If the other party had other tricks up his sleeve, it might be possible.……At the same time.Primal Chaos void.The great Dao was in chaos, and the experts were killing each other.The two third level venerable sovereigns looked at each other and frowned.Although Silver Moon had two more Dao Masters, they were only at the first rank. After fusing them, they were only at the second rank and had not reached the third rank. Now, they had two third rank Dao Masters to deal with second rank venerable sovereigns.The rank two expert was only dealing with a rank one.As for a rank one expert, he was only able to deal with a half-step sovereign! However, he was unable to take down the other party even though he was completely crushed.As for the reason, the venerable sovereigns all knew it.Everyone, you're thinking too much!The venerable sovereign who was suppressing the Black Panther quickly sent a message,""Everyone, don't hold back! If he delayed it for too long, the longer the night, the more dreams he would have! This place is too close to the Crimson Moon. If the experts of the Crimson Moon come, we won't be able to get anything ... This great Dao universe is just a newborn universe and isn't too strong. It can accommodate you and me ... At most, it'll be the difference between a Dao master and a non-Dao master ... We can discuss it later!"If this went on, no one wanted to use their full strength. They wanted to drag it out until the others were both injured. After a long time, it would be troublesome if the others arrived and beat them to it.A third level venerable sovereign was not weak. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The man had held back a lot earlier, but now, he suddenly exploded with power. A powerful flame appeared, burning the entire sky. The Black Panther's huge body was instantly set on fire!The other third stage venerable sovereign's eyes flickered as well, and a strong wind swept across the world!The two merged rivers of the great path instantly trembled and were torn apart by the astral wind.The two third level venerable sovereigns were still United at this time, and they barely reached an agreement.Let's deal with them first!The remaining two venerable sovereigns thought about it and decided to attack as well. Lin Hongyu was the most miserable. She was not a venerable sovereign, but when she encountered a true venerable sovereign, it was fine if the opponent held back. If he went all out ... The gap between them would be huge!Under normal circumstances, five to six half-step sovereigns would find it difficult to defeat a venerable sovereign.On the other side, Heaven's Fate was also cursing. He was the most talkative person on the entire battlefield. At this moment, he was loudly cursing,""You're all looking for death. I'm a neo martial heaven-tier! My father is the new Wuxi Emperor, and I'm just a clone. My real body is nearby. You dare to kill my clone? you're just a few low-rank venerable sovereigns. You're dead! No matter where you run, you're dead!"The second level venerable sovereign who was fighting with him frowned slightly and attacked even more ruthlessly!They were all itinerant cultivators of the primordial chaos. Who was afraid of who?I'll just kill you and escape!Although neo martial was strong, it was not the Overlord of chaos. They had to deal with Hong Yue first. Otherwise, they knew the situation of a mere Emperor of the West. He was a fifth level venerable sovereign, but ... So what?Who are you trying to scare!Besides, the new martial Western Emperor's battle record ... Was very bad.They came from the tianfang region and didn't know much about the Hongyue region. However, they did know the battle records of some top experts. It was said that the new martial Western Emperor's Strongest Battle record was that he had only defeated a tier four expert ... He had only defeated him and that was it.There didn't seem to be any record of killing!What was there to be afraid of?Besides, it's just a clone, not your real body!After Heaven's Fate shouted for a while, he was beaten up again. At this moment, he was also helpless. It was a pity that my father's reputation was not very useful. He could only shout again,"You don't fear my father, but what about the Autarchs? The grandson of the new martial Supreme is still here. If the Supreme is enraged, the new martial human King, sun god, and Emperor Cang will not let you off ..."BOOM!With a loud sound, the second level venerable sovereign hit him with a Thunderbolt, burning him dry. He said coldly,""New martial arts should deal with Red Moon first! Tian Ji, you're a third rank venerable sovereign. How can you be so childish?"
