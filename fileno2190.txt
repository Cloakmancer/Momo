 Li Fuhai was quite satisfied with this.Zhang an didn't say anything else and looked at the second elder.""What about you guys? Will you come with me, or ... Will you continue to negotiate with heavenstar, or even ... Have a fight?"The second elder was silent.Had a fight?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  A true non-traitor was definitely no match for Li Hao. Even a Saint had yet to fully recover. Anyone who had the ability to fight Li Hao was no longer a slumbering neo martial artist."We'll follow the division Chief ... But ... The world is so big, where should we go?"the second elder sighed."There's always a place to stay. ""I don't care about those who are willing to stay," Zhang an said calmly."Heaven battling city has already joined Li Hao. If you have any ideas, you can stay! Everyone has their own aspirations. Neo martial arts has disappeared for 100000 years, so there's no need for them to follow me ... The only people I want to take away are those who don't want to be with Li Hao! "This might be an opportunity as well. The controller of the new Dao, the leader of the new era, the world has just been restored, and everything has to start from scratch. This is an opportunity ... The choice is in your hands!"In the city, all the experts fell silent.Now, he could either follow Zhang an or stay and rely on Li Hao.There was no other way.As for joining the Zheng family ... That was also one way, but it was something most people could not accept."I'll leave with the division Chief. The rest ... Are free to choose!" The second elder said after a long while."I'm leaving too!""Me too!"“……”The powerhouses quickly made their choices.However, after waiting for a long time, the second elder glanced at The Guardian demons in the city. The saint's tree was a little bitter.This one ... Didn't answer.It wanted to stay.Zhang an also took a look and was not too surprised. As a monster plant, his feelings for neo martial arts were not that deep. Now that he was following Zhang an, he still did not know where to go.Furthermore, it was more difficult to revive the monster plants.Zhang an, can you resuscitate them?"Then those of you who have stayed behind ... When we meet again in the future, there's no need to care about our old friendship!"" 100000 years of guarding is enough to pay back everything!" Zhang an said softly.As soon as he finished speaking, he turned to look at li Fuhai."Fuhai, those who are staying ... You can decide for yourself. I hope you won't disappoint them!"After he finished speaking, he disappeared with the others.Li Fuhai just looked on and didn't say anything. Zhang an appeared!This was the first time he had appeared in front of other people since the destruction of boundless city.However, when they reappeared, they took away a few experts from martial Union.There were not too many people from martial Union who had recovered, roughly 30 or so. Among them, there were Saints like the second elder, undying like the seventh elder, and a small number of experts like military officers and directors who were still alive.As for the ones that remained, close to a third of them were monster plants.Although Zhang an brought the second elder and the others with him, he did not bring martial Union's Army with him. Many of these soldiers were just remnants. If he brought them away, they might die. If they stayed, they might still have a chance to be resurrected.At this moment, Liu Yan couldn't help but say in a low voice,""We're just going to let him take those people away?"Qian Wuliang smiled,"general Liu, it's better to avoid unnecessary trouble." Otherwise ... Some conflict might break out. Although I'm not afraid, it'll put fellow Daoists Jiang Ying and Li in a difficult position, as well as the sea Protector and the others ... Now, perhaps this is the best result!"Zhang an took away some powerhouses, which saved them from fighting.He would probably go to the other major cities.Next, the people who stayed in the main city of neo martial might be split up. Some would stay, some would go with Zhang an, and some ... Might not go anywhere, but take the main city and run with Hurricane city.Qian Wuliang estimated that the star River City, the main city of the Zhou family, had most likely been taken by the enemy.He didn't care about that. Soon, he looked at the big tree in the city and smiled brightly.""It is the blessing of the Heavenly Star that senior protector is willing to stay! The Marquis was busy today and couldn't come. When the Marquis was done, he would definitely come personally to welcome senior and join heavenstar to work together for a great cause! General Huai, general Hong, and the others must be looking forward to the arrival of senior!"It seemed like it was not bad to have another Saint.Moreover, martial Union's city had fallen into heavenstar's hands. Although it no longer had much energy left and could not be activated ... With the main city in their hands, who would care about that measly amount of energy?What was important was the military equipment and machinery.Qian Wuliang knew that the division of neo martial's remains would be completed soon.Zhang an appeared. He had not expected this.However, the appearance of the other party gave a way out for Sky Star and neo martial arts, which was a good thing. Otherwise, they could only fight. With Li Hao's current thoughts, he would not let these neo martial artists leave so easily.……On this day, Li Hao was cultivating, Ying Hongyue and the others were cultivating, the Queen had resurrected a God, and new martial arts had begun to change.Just as Qian Wuliang had guessed, the Galaxy city of the Zhou family had appeared in Blizzard Silver City and was activated.This also meant that the Zhou family had either betrayed the Zhou family or been captured by the traitor.Martial Union had split into two.There was a violent riot in the Zhang family's dingtian city. The rumbling in the city continued for a long time. Finally, a few powerhouses from the Zhang family walked out and left with Zhang an when he arrived.When Qian Wuliang and the others entered the city, they were all shocked.

2191 Chapter 368
In the city, The Guardian monster plant was directly smashed into pieces!And Zhang an had taken away the remaining people, which meant ... The Guardian monster plant might have betrayed them and fought with the Zhang family in the city. However, the complete Guardian monster plant was actually defeated and killed!It could be seen that the Zhang family's combat power was still extremely strong.So far, out of the eight major cities, only the Hong family had not appeared.It was as if he had completely disappeared.……The eight major cities were either sealed or divided.At this point, the situation in Silver Moon was clear.Li Hao, Zheng Yu, Red Moon sovereign, and Zhang an all had many experts.As for Ying Hongyue, she was all alone.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Although the Queen had five Saint-level deities, Li Hao didn't think much of them.……At the end of the great wilderness.Li Hao also received the news. At this moment, he smiled.Interesting!Zhang an appeared.They also took some people with them. This group of people really represented neo martial.Zhang an ...In the end, Zhang an still didn't come to his side. He still believed in neo martial arts. It wasn't wrong, but ... He hoped it wouldn't disturb him.This was also good!After all, heaven battling city was filled with neo martial artists. Even if heaven battling city was willing to suppress those neo martial artists, it would be a bit uncomfortable.In this way, neo martial was divided into three.He took a group, the Zheng family took a group, and Zhang an took a group with him.At this moment, Li Hao's aura trembled.Divine runes circled around him.He turned his head to look at the vast wilderness. It was time to act. The migration had been going on for the past few days. Everyone was busy with their own work, but their movements were not slow.He raised his head and looked at the Silver Moon hanging in the sky.Li daoheng ...Do you know what I'm going to do?Or rather, you know it but can't stop it?Or perhaps ... You don't care if you stop me or not, and perhaps I'll open the heaven of great desolation is the result you want to see?If that's the case ... You're really amazing.However, before the great wilderness recovered, there was still one more thing he had to do.At this moment, Li Hao instantly disappeared.No one knew how many divine runes he had condensed.……Li Dynasty.Shui Yun and Da Huang had merged with heavenstar one after another, and the gods of the God nation had suffered countless casualties. On the other hand, the Li Dynasty had not suffered much losses and was still considered to be prosperous.The Imperial Palace of Dali.It was extremely majestic! There was no resplendence, only a majestic atmosphere with a hint of wildness.The Dali King was cultivating at the moment. In an instant, his expression changed and he punched out.BOOM!The void was shrouded in a layer of territory. The Dali King's punch caused the territory to shake. The Dali King's expression changed and he said in a low voice,""Li Hao!"Li Hao appeared out of thin air.He glanced at the king of Dali and smiled. Then, he looked around and nodded,""This is a good place!"The king of Dali was expressionless and only looked at him.Li Hao looked into the distance and saw through everything. He saw a huge Hall and said,""Who is the God of beginner martial that Dali believes in? Don't talk about the sun god ... It's impossible. ""I don't know,""What?"The Dali King frowned,"I wonder who it is!" He's the God of beginner martial anyway, and he hasn't shown himself yet, so how would I know who he is?"That was true."Then you guys just randomly believe in it?""Not really. They're all beginner gods anyway. It doesn't matter who they believe in!"Li Hao laughed. This ... He had nothing to say.He didn't care about this. After a few glances, he vaguely felt a majestic aura, but it was very weak. Perhaps the other party was really sleeping. He didn't care much and said,""Your Majesty, do you have any other thoughts other than cultivation?"Compared to when they were retreating, this one was even stronger.Coupled with the fact that the forbidden Sea was recovering, the source was here. The energy in the Li Dynasty was extremely rich at the moment, and a few powerhouses could be seen absorbing the energy in a frenzy to cultivate.This kind of power from the forbidden Sea at the beginning of the world seemed to be more suitable for the beginner martial path to cultivate.The king of Dali was probably at the seventh level of the sun Moon realm now.Or even stronger!One must know that when he left, he was only at the 5th or 6th stage of the sun Moon realm. Director Zhao and the others had paid a huge price to advance to the 7th stage."What idea?"The king of Dali didn't know what Li Hao was going to do, so he was very vigilant."How about I give the Li Dynasty's King a chance?" Li Hao smiled."Speak," he said."The beginner level is more suitable for cultivation at the beginning of the world, and you'll definitely improve at a lightning speed ... Right?"Nonsense! The so-called initial stage of martial arts was the world of chaos. The first batch of cultivators would naturally improve rapidly in that kind of environment.Why are you telling me this?"How about I create a new world for you?" Li Hao asked."What?""Opening up a new world ... The Fake New World is actually the old heaven replacing the new heaven!""The price you have to pay is very small," Li Hao said indifferently."You are blessed by the heavens, so you just have to pay the heavens!"At this moment, the domain enveloped them.Li Hao wasn't afraid of being found out. He chuckled and said,""As for me, I will provide you with the most suitable environment for your cultivation! Now, the Queen of the West, Ying Hongyue, and the others are all about to enter the Dao integration stage, but you're still at the seventh level of the sun Moon realm ... You're too weak. If you're lucky, it won't be difficult for you to enter the Dao integration stage. "The Dali King frowned.He glanced at Li Hao and said after a long time,""Without the blessing of the heavens, what will I lose?"Li Hao chuckled and shook his head."You won't lose anything. That's because ... Even if you're blessed by the heavens, you won't be able to become the master of the heavens and earth!" So ... To you, there's no difference. The biggest difference is that you've cut off some of your own thoughts. "

2192 Chapter 368
The king of Dali cursed in his heart!These words were too hurtful.Li Hao almost said,"it doesn't matter if you have it or not. You can't do it anyway!""You can expel heaven's will?" the Dali King frowned."More or less.""How do you create a cultivation environment that is suitable for the initial stage of martial arts?" "Do you want to know?"  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  "If you knew, I would have told you!" Li Hao gave him a deep look.“……”The king of Dali was a little embarrassed, and after a long while, he said,""Forget it!"Li Hao smiled.However, the king of Dali was still a little uneasy."Is it dangerous?""You're afraid of danger?""This King is naturally not afraid, but I can't send myself to my death for no reason!"Li Hao nodded."It's definitely a little dangerous. As for how dangerous it is, I'm not sure. We'll know once we try. Also, after this is done, you have to help me with something."The Dali King frowned.There were more and more requests!"What is it?""We'll talk about it when it's done. "The king of Dali was at a loss. After a long while, he said,"Then ... Can Jiang Li go?"“……”As expected!Li Hao's expression was as if he had expected this. The Dali King thought of what Li Hao had said that day, and his expression changed, becoming somewhat unsightly.This bastard!What was he thinking?Li Hao smiled."Sure. Jiang Li can even bring the bone of beginner martial artist. If the opportunity is right, he can integrate the bone of beginner martial artist into it. Perhaps he will gain more!" As for you, you'd better wear your pair of gloves ... This is good stuff!""Does Jiang Li need to reforge his body?" he asked."Li Hao!"The Dali King's face was cold."You're the master of a region. Don't you ... Feel ashamed to say that?"This detestable fellow!Li Hao laughed."Don't be angry. Why do you have to do this? I was just asking. If you don't want to trade, then forget it!" In addition, you've lost quite a bit of heaven's will recently. It seems that heaven's will thinks you're useless and doesn't want to favor you anymore. Make some trouble and get more heaven's will. The North isn't too far from the West. Lead the Army and attack the divine Kingdom in the West ... The Queen has resurrected a few Saint path gods. I'll get people to help you ... No matter how much territory you conquer, it'll all be yours. "The Dali King frowned.He didn't want to send troops!From the North to the West ... It wasn't too far, but what was the point of taking down the divine Kingdom of the West?Seeing this, Li Hao said softly,'the God nation's million-strong Army was annihilated. More than half of shuiyun's million-strong Army had been reduced, leaving only 200000 to defend the four Seas! The vast wilderness had countless cavalries, but only a few would be kept as a Mobile Force. King of Dali, I've never liked to kill people without mercy! But ... Even if I don't care about the side of the bed, someone will. "The king of Dali was silent.He knew what Li Hao meant.I won't force you if you don't join us.However, the Li Dynasty had millions of soldiers. Qian Wuliang had used up one of them, and now Li Hao was here again. To ask Li Hao to attack the divine Kingdom was not only to get the blessing of the heavens, but also to weaken the Li Dynasty.There were still many believers in the divine Kingdom.If they were to fight ... With a few divine gods ... The king of Dali looked at Li Hao and said in a deep voice,""After Yuan Shuo and the others died in battle, your methods became even more vicious!"Li Hao smiled and shook his head,"no, I'm gentler!" You don't understand me, but don't pretend to understand me. That day, in order to deal with the Li Dynasty, I once thought of killing the millions of soldiers in the Cang mountains ... At that time, my master advised me not to do so. After my master fell into a deep sleep, it's just that ... No one advised me anymore. "Do you think you understand me?What a joke!The Dali King was slightly shocked!No one persuaded him!He understood Li Hao's meaning. This was his true nature, not because his personality had changed after Yuan Shuo's death, but because ... No one could stop him."How many saints can you send?" the king of Dali took a deep breath."There aren't enough Saints ... Come over, ninth master.""Just one person?" the king of Dali's expression changed."Not enough?""They have five Saints," the Dali King said angrily."You have one. Even if Jiang Li and I can fight one, what about the other three?" Li Hao, do you want the Li Dynasty to be destroyed?""You're underestimating my Ninth Division commander?"Li Hao smiled.The king of Dali was furious, but he did not say anything.Seeing this, Li Hao laughed again,"I'm just joking ... Let Sequoia come again. That's enough, you two!" Not enough ... You, God of beginner martial, aren't you going to do something? 'If that's the case, then the Li Dynasty doesn't seem to have much of a Foundation to speak of. Since that's the case ... So be it if you're annihilated!'“With that, Li Hao rose into the air and withdrew his domain. Looking at the temple in the distance, he bowed slightly and said with a smile,""Senior should have recovered a little. It's said that the God of beginner martial arts is extremely powerful. I wish senior a Swift victory!"As soon as he finished speaking, his voice fell into the ears of the king of Dali again,""Be quick, I'll make my move in 10 days. The stronger your heaven's will is, the higher your chances! If you could conquer the divine Kingdom, the Heaven's Will would definitely favor you. By then, you might even reach the mid-stage or late-stage Dao integration realm! As a King, a General's success is built on ten thousand bones ... I, Li Hao, lost my entire family to get to where I am today ... King of the Li Dynasty, be more willing to give up!"After saying that, Li Hao disappeared.The king of Dali cursed in his heart!Bastard!This guy was trying to weaken the Li Dynasty so that the God of beginner martial would make a move. Just as Li Hao said, if the God of beginner martial couldn't even deal with Saints, why would the Li Dynasty ... Exist?Without any threat, it was better to eliminate them directly!The king of Dali took a deep breath and thought of what Li Hao had said. Li Hao would not lie to you.Since he had said so, it meant that ... There was really such a chance.Thinking of this, the king of Dali ordered,""All tribe leaders and military officers, come to the palace for a meeting!"Take down the divine Kingdom!If he could take it down, perhaps the Heaven's Will would be much stronger.A moment later, everyone rushed over. A shadow even appeared behind Jiang Li. King Dali saw it but didn't say anything.It was obvious that the God of beginner martial had indeed recovered.And now, he was here to listen.……After a meeting, it was decided that speed was the most important thing in war. Not long after, the Li Army set out again. When they heard that this time, they were not going to attack the Heavenly Star, but the divine Kingdom, the Li Army heaved a sigh of relief.Who was afraid of God nation?On the other hand, heavenstar couldn't afford to offend Li Hao. The king was wise, and it seemed like it wouldn't be a bad idea to attack the divine Kingdom!It didn't take long for the divine Kingdom to receive some news.The Li Dynasty ... Had turned from the end of the North to the West and was charging toward the West!The Queen was furious when she heard the news.It's fine if you can't afford to offend Li Hao, but you, the king of Dali, dare to invade my God nation?A great battle was about to start.At this moment, Li Hao returned to the vast wilderness with a bright smile."You guys can fight. I'm going to create a fake world in ten days!"

2193 Chapter 369
(After 12 o' clock, the monthly votes will be doubled. Give me some monthly votes.)At the Northwest border.Battle cries filled the air.The million-strong li Army set out once again, but this time, their opponents were different. On the other side, the believers of the divine Kingdom were also extremely crazy. Under the call of several gods, they continued to charge.However, these believers were not the elites of the divine Kingdom.The true elites were all dead.The Queen held her scepter in her hand, her expression somewhat unsightly.The next moment, the scepter was waved.Two gods appeared in an instant. One was the God of misfortune, and the other was the God of disaster. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In an instant, a miserable scream resounded through the world.A disaster had descended!The earth suddenly split open, sending thousands of Li Dynasty soldiers to their deaths. Misfortune followed. Countless Li Dynasty soldiers suddenly fell, bumped into their companions, mistook the enemy, and killed the wrong opponent ...At this moment, a sword radiance flashed across the sky.BOOM!A sword pierced through the void.A moment later, a massive Golden Tree, suffused with Primal Chaos energy, swept through the world, its countless branches spreading in all directions as it massacred a vast number of believers."As expected!" The Queen's expression turned ugly. He knew that the Li Dynasty would not go on an expedition to the West for no reason.As soon as Li Daozong and Hong shanmu arrived, she knew that Li Hao must have been secretly controlling them. Damn B * stard."The Prophet!"Beside him, the white-haired old man closed his eyes for a moment, and his expression became slightly solemn.""Be careful, Your Majesty. There are still experts!"The Queen nodded.If Li Hao had been secretly controlling it, it wouldn't have been so simple.She was also very heavy."What does Li Hao want to do?"Was there any use in conquering the West?That guy has a bunch of enemies now, what's the point of attacking the God nation?The two armies fought, and the Li Dynasty suffered great losses.There were many Western believers, and although they were no match for the Li Dynasty, the Li Dynasty's Army was made up of elite soldiers. Once they suffered heavy losses ... They would not have a good end.At this moment, the Prophet looked at the opposite side for a while and sighed in his heart.Li Hao ... Had the looks of an Emperor!Drive the wolf to swallow the Tiger!Even an Overlord like the king of Dali had no choice but to be led by Li Hao. In the battle between Dali and the divine Kingdom, even if all of them died, that person probably wouldn't care. Just now, the two gods of the divine path had killed tens of thousands of soldiers in an instant.However, Hong Mu and the ninth Division commander did not make a move at the first moment.It could be seen that these two did not take the life and death of the Li Army seriously.……At this moment, Jiang Li's face was pale. He sent a message,""My King, the enemy's believers are not afraid of death! Some of them were just ordinary believers, and killing them was useless. On the other hand, the Li Dynasty Army suffered heavy losses! Even if we kill tens of millions of people from the West, it won't be enough to exchange for one million of our Li Dynasty's elites!"In terms of losses, at least 100000 people from the West had been killed in the first battle, while the Li Army had only lost about 10000 people. But ... Would it work?There were too many such believers in the divine Kingdom.And the Li Dynasty's elite army in exchange for these people's lives ... No matter how one looked at it, it was not worth it!The Dali King was expressionless.Was he willing to?He was not willing.But ... This was the best outcome. If he refused, Li Hao might not take action immediately, but it would not be long before Li Dynasty's existence became a problem.Should he surrender?Those who believed in the God of beginner martial in the country would probably not be willing to surrender.At this moment, the Dali King was extremely calm,"simple, let the gods fight the gods!" The God of beginner martial arts, the God of the new martial era, is he no match for the God of a small world?"These gods were considered beginner gods.Of course, one was the God of the Silver Moon, and the other was the God of the neo martial era countless years ago.Jiang Li's expression changed slightly.This was disrespectful to the gods!Of course, he knew that it wasn't just the king of Dali. In this day and age, many people didn't respect gods. If Li Hao were here, he might have said something even worse."Your Majesty, that one hasn't fully recovered yet ..." Jiang Li said in a deep voice.The Dali King nodded,"it hasn't fully recovered yet. It shouldn't be a problem to deal with a Saint, right?" It's not good that it's completely recovered. It might not appear in the world, right?"It was also this logic.Jiang Li was speechless."We, the Dali dynasty, have believed in them for so many years," the king of Dali said."Now that we need help, are we ... Still not willing to help?""This ..."Jiang Li was speechless.The Dali King's voice was like a great Bell, shaking the world. His roar resounded in all directions,""Fight! Continue to advance, charge, destroy! I, the God of Dali, am about to join the battle and sweep away these false gods! The false god must die! My God is invincible in the world!""Kill!"The Li Dynasty Army instantly exploded with excitement.The God of Dali was about to appear!For countless years, the Li Dynasty had believed in a God of beginner martial arts. The power of the divine Hall had always been stronger than that of the Royal power. Even today, the power of the divine Hall was still strong, as could be seen from Jiang Li.Even if the king of Dali was well-versed in martial arts, it would still be difficult to suppress the power of the temple.At this moment, the Dali King said that the God of beginner martial was going to participate in the battle and slaughter the false gods ... Everyone was extremely excited, and their morale instantly soared.The king of Dali also looked calm."I also want to see who the God we believe in is, what his strength is, how powerful he is ...If he doesn't appear in this battle ... I've already made it public. If you don't appear, do you still want the people of Dali to believe in you?Regardless of whether the other party would appear or not ... It would be a good thing for him.This time, if the other party did not appear, the divine Dao forces would be completely removed!Jiang Li and the other priests obediently joined the Imperial court.If he were to appear, he would be able to see just who was stronger between him and the false gods.The king of Dali was also forcing him to abdicate.

2194 Chapter 369
Li Hao had only sent two saints. He had no other choice. There were many saints in the divine nation, and without the God of beginner martial, he and Jiang Li could only stop one Saint.……At this moment, the Queen and the others 'expressions changed slightly.The God of beginner martial!The God of beginner martial arts referred to the first generation of beginner martial artists.The descendants of beginner martial artists were not counted. Only the first generation of beginner martial artists who had walked their own path could be considered the God of beginner martial arts. Dali had always declared to the outside world that they believed in the sun god ... But not many people believed it.Those who truly understood neo martial knew that sun god was not weaker than the human king and emperor Cang.In the new martial era, the three most powerful people were the sun god, the human King, and Emperor Cang.Under these three Supreme martial artists, Supreme martial artist Zhang, heavenly suppression King, and King of earth were the most outstanding.Below them were a large number of venerable sovereigns, including the ancient nine emperors, the ancient forging venerable sovereigns, the blood Emperor, and the Ironhead venerable sovereign.Below them, there were many venerable sovereigns who were even weaker, such as nether King and battle King.After that, it was the venerable sovereigns such as the water power and the Wuji power.It was conceivable that even venerable sovereigns were divided into many levels, and the God of beginner martial ... In fact, no one believed that there was a real God of beginner martial here. Back then, a large number of them were killed by the human King, and there were only a few of them left.Moreover, the remaining people were extremely powerful.At the very least, he was still a half-step Emperor.How could he still be here?Moreover, the surviving beginner gods were all well-known. Who would pretend to be the sun god and do such a tasteless thing?The Queen and the others did not believe it.But even if he wasn't ... He should still be a beginner martial artist, or perhaps a second, third, or even more generation descendant. He shouldn't be too weak.……At this moment, the Queen and the others were extremely afraid.At the same time. The great wilderness.The sky screen appeared.Li Hao was also watching the battle.He was very clear and familiar with the top powerhouses of both sides, so he was not very curious. But ... He was very curious about the God of beginner martial.To dare to use the name of sun god, this person was no ordinary person.His courage wasn't ordinary!Also, the other party had always kept a low profile and almost never showed himself. What was his goal?Just to sleep comfortably here?Or was it because the environment in Dali was better?Also, all gods actually sought the power of faith, but there was something strange about the Li Dynasty ... The people of the Li Dynasty actually believed in this person, but ... Because he used the name of the sun god, everyone actually believed in the sun god.As such, the power of faith did not seem to have been absorbed by that person. Instead, it had disappeared.This was very thought-provoking! The power of faith ... Had it been absorbed by the sun god?He crossed the universe and took you away?Li Hao was really curious about this person. Also, the revival of gods was through the power of faith, but the beginner gods here were likely to be alive. Beginner gods either had a strong body, vitality, or mind.In short, there must be a system that was extremely powerful.The other party, on the other hand, had been absorbing energy all this time, and looked like he had just recovered ... He was in such a miserable state that he did not know what was going on. He did not reveal his true identity to absorb the power of faith. The people of Dali actually believed in loneliness.Li Hao watched without blinking. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He also wanted to see what would happen and whether the other party would appear.The other party did not absorb the power of faith. Perhaps he did not care whether the Li Dynasty believed in him or not. His actions were very strange. Li Hao did not pay much attention to it at first, but when he returned from the West and compared it to the Li Dynasty, he was instantly interested in this person.There were gods who did not absorb the power of faith?Then, did you build a temple just to sleep?Li Hao was naturally very interested in this God of beginner martial arts. He didn't know if he would be a variable.At this moment, there were still people beside him.The Black Panther was currently hooking up with the White Horse, and Princess ni was also looking at the battlefield with curiosity. In fact, she was even a little tempted. In fact, she really wanted such a battlefield, but it seemed like there wouldn't be many opportunities in the vast wilderness.Li Hao played with a few divine runes and suddenly said,""Is the sea Protector still here?"In the void, the power overturning the sea appeared.Li Hao asked the obvious.How could he not know that she was still there?"Lord Marquis, is there something you need?""Nothing, I'm just a little curious. Back then, when the eight major cities stood in great numbers, how did they allow the Li Dynasty to survive? Does the sword Saint know about this?""I know.""You didn 't?""No, I didn 't,""Has there been any mention of the God of beginner martial arts, Dali?""Never.""He's been in Silver Moon all this time?"Li Hao asked, puzzled."I've always been!"Li Fuhai thought for a moment and said,"a long, long time ago, I was here!" It was just that ... He had never appeared! We didn't care about it, and neither did venerable the sword. We all thought that it might be to find a way out for the beginner level. ""Many of the initial stage martial spirits were killed, and when the human King revived the world ... He didn't revive many initial stage martial spirits. If it wasn't for the sun god, he revived a few ... The initial stage martial spirits would have been even worse off! It's also because of sun God's reputation ... No one will easily provoke Chu Wu. "The sun god was very influential.It was so big that even the sword venerable had to give him three points.He was an extremely carefree fellow who wandered the chaosverse alone. Li Hao had heard the human King mention once in "Zhan Tian" that the sun god was injured, apparently by the world Lord of the Crimson Moon world.However ... In the face of a world Lord, a world Lord who dared to invade neo martial, the other party was only injured. One could imagine how strong he was.

2195 Chapter 369
One should know that in a world, there were a lot of venerable sovereigns.Under such circumstances, the other party was still able to escape and send a message ... There was no need to elaborate on his strength.Li Hao nodded."The temple ... Already existed at that time?" he asked."There is.""Did you use the name of sun god at that time?"Li Fuhai felt a little strange and only said after a while,""No, I used ... Celestial ruler Batian!"“……”Li Hao was stunned."Is it the previous incarnation of the iron head venerable sovereign?""Yes,""You're so bold?""Because the blood Emperor and the others do not admit that they are reincarnated and have lived a Second Life, so ... Unless you deliberately humiliate them, no one will say anything if you use it. Even heaven battling city, which is also the name of heaven battling Emperor, has been bestowed by the blood Emperor himself. No one will say anything.""No wonder the Batian Emperor's gloves are over there ...""It can't really be celestial ruler Batian, can it?" Li Hao asked, confused."I won 't,"Li Fuhai shook his head and said,"that's impossible!" Celestial ruler Batian was dead, he was really dead. If the few of them didn't die, how could there be those who came later? Moreover, if he was the real celestial ruler, Red Moon sovereign could be killed with one punch! There's no such thing as a deep sleep. "Okay.However, in the era when neo martial had not been isolated, to dare to call himself the celestial ruler's temple ... He was really not an ordinary person.This time, Li Hao was even more interested.Just as he was thinking, an illusionary figure appeared in the sky. His appearance could not be seen clearly, as if he had shielded his own appearance. His voice was very calm, and it was impossible to tell if he was male or female."Since you want to see the strength of the God of beginner martial ... Then I'll show you!"He seemed to be talking to the king of Dali, but he also seemed to be talking to Li Hao.At this moment, li Fuhai's eyes widened, as if he was trying to identify the other party, but he also seemed to have recognized the other party ... However, Li Hao couldn't guess whether he recognized the other party or not, and the guy didn't say anything.Li Hao was also watching intently.……On the battlefield.The Prophet God's face changed slightly, and in an instant, he appeared at the same time as the God of fate. As if he had foreseen the opponent's attack trajectory, the Prophet God instantly appeared in an area, and on the other side, the goddess of fate murmured,""Fate ... Is unpredictable!"p BOOM!  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, everyone on the battlefield felt that their fates had been changed. It was as if they would die in the next moment under the shockwaves of the battle.Fear, uneasiness, and fear ...People's hearts were in chaos. They saw their own death, saw their fate ...Just as they were panicking ...The illusionary figure didn't say anything and punched out! The sky cracked!The world cracked open!Fate was broken. Fate and precognition seemed to be useless. The Prophet God saw the fist coming in advance, but he couldn't avoid it. With a loud roar, he also struck out with his palm!BOOM!The palm exploded, and the God of fate spewed out golden blood one after another. A huge millstone appeared above the God of beginner martial's head as if it was going to reverse his fate.At this moment, the God of beginner martial chuckled and said with a playful tone,""The strong can change the fate of the weak, but the weak ... Can not change the fate of the strong! If you forcefully change it, you'll be seeking your own destruction!"BOOM!The God of fate's body suddenly exploded.The Prophet God's expression changed drastically. At this moment, the Queen rushed over, her scepter breaking the world. Her expression was also extremely serious.What a powerful person!They were both at the Saint stage, but the other party's strength seemed to have surpassed all the Saints.The God of beginner martial didn't seem to care and punched out again!The Golden fist broke the sky and earth in an instant.The powerful qi and blood energy seemed to indicate that this was an existence who had cultivated his physical body's qi and blood to the extreme. He was like a real celestial ruler. BOOM!The scepter was directly smashed into pieces!"The gods of faith ... Can be considered gods, but they are the weakest type of gods! A beginner God doesn't rely on faith to become a God, but on himself. You're a gift from the heavens, while a beginner God is fighting for a meal from the heavens. Do you understand?"These words had exposed the heavenly secret!The gods 'expressions changed.To snatch a mouthful of rice to eat!This might be the biggest difference between the two!The Silver Moon god was born powerful, while the God of the beginner level was born weak. In the struggle, he rose step by step, found his own way to survive, sought his own Dao, and became a God!BOOM!As soon as the man finished speaking, his fist covered the entire battlefield, and in an instant, several gods were forced to retreat.On the other side, the ninth Division commander and Hong Mu were both shocked and retreated.At this moment, the God of misfortune and disaster also appeared instantly to help the Queen resist.BOOM!One punch after another.The God of beginner martial was terrifyingly powerful, and his voice continued to shake the world.""The beginner level of martial arts cultivates one's body and not the great Dao. The primary stage of cultivation was the source! Therefore, whether it's the great Dao of origins or the new Dao, they have nothing to do with the initial martial stage!"He did not seem to be speaking to anyone else, but to Li Hao.I am not your enemy.You don't need to test me, you don't need to target me."In this world, venerable the sword once had the hope of going back to the source and entering the beginner level. He could go against the heavens and change fate, and integrate thousands of DAOs into his body. Therefore, venerable the sword can tolerate the beginner level ..."

2196 Chapter 369
……The great wilderness.Li Hao's expression was grave. His eyes were fixed on her.At this moment, I'm feeling a little regretful. Perhaps I should go and take a look personally.Take a look at the scene!This world could only accommodate the lower level of Saints.However, this person ... Actually killed a Saint with a single punch ... He was too strong!He had underestimated this God of beginner martial arts!Beside him, li Fuhai's eyes were also shocked,'tyrant fist! Impossible ... It can't be celestial ruler BA ... Could this person be the inheritor of celestial ruler BA ... But ... Celestial ruler BA has no descendants or disciples ... Could he be the inheritor of Ironhead sovereign? But why did you say it was the initial stage?"The iron head venerable sovereign was not at the beginner level, but the new level!What was going on?At this moment, it was also confused. Which beginner martial stage expert was this?He had only recovered his Saint power, but he had easily defeated a few divine spirits. This guy was too strong."This is Gokudo path! The Dao of extremity, an extreme expert! This person ... Had extremely strong combat strength! His physical body is even stronger than mine. What a terrifying fellow!"Li Hao's face was also grave.Was the God of beginner martial so powerful?……  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, in Hurricane city.Zheng Yu seemed to have seen this scene as well. Ever since the Saints could walk out, Li Hao's blockade on them was not as powerful as before. Although communication was still not working, there were still many tricks up his sleeve for a Saint.At this moment, he also saw this scene, and his expression changed slightly.Who was this person?He knew of this beginner God's existence, but his existence ... Was too lacking in sense of presence. He had always been far away from the central mainland, just at the northern end. He had built a small temple, and it seemed to have been a hundred thousand years ago ... No, even more years ago, ever since everyone had come to Silver Moon, he had been sleeping.It was as if he had nothing to do with the collapse of the sky and the collapse of the earth!At this moment, the other party had made his move!It was only the power of the Holy way, but it was extremely powerful. This was not something that ordinary people could do."Who is this person?"He looked at the powerhouses behind him and said in a deep voice,""Did anyone recognize it?"There were many experts here.Even the powerhouses from the Zhou and Liu families shook their heads. Someone said seriously,""He might be the successor of the venerable sovereign of ccmau ... But, it doesn't match! If he was that person's successor, there was no need to use the name of an initial stage martial artist! This person's body is strong and his qi and blood are unparalleled ... He might really be a strong warrior from the early martial era. "Zheng Yu cursed in his heart!How could there be such a problem?This person was so low-profile that it made one's hair stand on end!At this moment, he suddenly jumped out. He dared to say that if his clone walked out ... It would only reach this level at most. He was a half-Emperor!From the looks of it, this person was at least a Heavenly King.At this moment, he didn't even know if it was his avatar or his original body.How detestable!He was getting more and more irritated. Recently, he felt that he was getting more and more out of control. It was just a small world, but the venerable sword had left, and almost all the powerhouses of the eight great families had left.However, he felt like he was losing control of this small world. Why?He had originally thought that his biggest enemy in this revival and control of the small world would be Red Moon sovereign. However, the emergence of experts made him feel a little uncomfortable.……He was uncomfortable, but the Queen was even more uncomfortable.He kept retreating and flying backward.He was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood!Why was it like this?Ever since she lost to Li Hao, it seemed that anyone she met could defeat her.Zheng Yu, Li Hao, Ying Hongyue, the God of beginner martial ... They appeared one after another. This time, they had revived four saintly way gods. Including herself, five powerful figures had been defeated.As for that person, he didn't seem to be in the mood to continue fighting. His voice was calm."Retreat, retreat, or else ... We'll die! The Li Dynasty needs half of the divine Kingdom's territory ...""You must be dreaming!"BOOM!The fist landed again, and the sky and earth cracked. The gods were defeated one after another. The Prophet God's face suddenly changed, and he hurriedly shouted,""Retreat!"With that, the gods quickly retreated.The other party's punch shattered the sky, and countless spatial cracks appeared. He allowed the few of them to retreat and did not give chase.Below, the Li Army was extremely excited, and the king of Li's expression changed slightly. So strong!"Charge!"The king of Dali did not say much. With a roar, he took the lead and led the Army to charge quickly, killing countless believers and occupying the realm of God!At this moment, as the Li Dynasty Army won and occupied the territory, a faint heaven's will covered the world, which seemed to be getting stronger.The shadow looked up at the will of heaven, then at the king of Dali ... And finally disappeared.The 9th Division commander and Hong Mu wanted to step forward to test the waters and say hello, but the other party just left like that.It was as if all of this was just to prove that the God of Dali was still around, that he was very strong, and that he should not be provoked.……The great wilderness.Li Hao's eyes flickered. Interesting.Very strong!"Sea Protector ... What do you think of this person's strength?""Very strong! It's just that with the restrictions of the world, I can't see the specifics. However ... This person is definitely not weaker than me. "Li Hao nodded slightly.He was a tough opponent.Li Dynasty, how interesting."Li Dynasty, the fire of the eight trigrams ... Is there a god of fire at the beginning stage of martial arts?""Yes, but they're long dead!"Li Fuhai said in a deep voice,"he died very, very early. Lord Marquis, do you suspect that he is the fire god?" It shouldn't be possible ...""Has the Li Dynasty's name been like this since ancient times?""This ... It seems so?"Li Fuhai was not too sure."At that time, there was no country. They were all under neo martial's territory, but I think ... I think they're called li ... I think so."

Li Hao nodded."Logically speaking, he should be in the South of the gossip. However, the other party is in the North of the Silver Moon. It seems that I've been overthinking."However, the positions of the eight trigrams were not necessarily consistent with reality. Sometimes, the positions would be reversed.Then being in the North ... It could be explained.Who was this person?Why had he remained unknown?Why did they build a divine Hall?Why didn't he use his real name?It wasn't that he didn't use his real name now, but that he didn't use his real name from the start. He always felt like he was being sneaky, or rather, he was keeping a low profile ... Anyway, while you guys were messing around, I would stay in Li Dynasty.Strange!Li Fuhai couldn't understand and see through it. After a long time, he said,""I'm not too sure, but Lord Marquis doesn't have to be too concerned. Just as the other party said, the beginner stage of martial arts cultivates the body, so the other party might not have the intention to invade the world core! If the revered sword did not devour the small world, perhaps ... He also had such thoughts. According to what he said, the revered sword could have gone back to the source and perhaps walked his own path ... He was not interested in devouring the Silver Moon. It is unusual for this person to know so much about it!""No matter what, I still have to care!" Li Hao shook his head.However, he didn't need to look into it now.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ It was fine as long as he knew of the other party's existence.At least, he knew that there was such a person.He quickly said,"no matter what the other party does!" As long as they don't come looking for trouble with me, it's fine! The one who should be more worried is not me, but the others!",m "Did you absorb all the chaos aura from the people who left?" he asked Princess ni."Yes!" Princess Yue nodded.Li Hao glanced at the White Horse. At this moment, the White Horse felt the gaze and became a little restless. Li Hao glanced at it and said nothing. He then looked at Black Panther."Heibao, are you ready?"Heibao nodded."Ask Sequoia to come back. Doesn't it cultivate the Qi of chaos? Use its roots to stabilize the new Sky! It's also a chance for it ...""The Marquis didn't choose the Imperial Guards?" li Fuhai couldn't help but ask.Such an opportunity might be more suitable for the Emperor guards."Make the best use of people and things! Creating a fake sky is not the real sky, and it's not creating a living being either. It's just stealing a corner of the Silver Moon. The Emperor guards walk the path of life, so they don't need to create life. It's useless for them to come!"Li Hao smiled."If I have the ability to create a new Sky in the chaos one day, I can find the Imperial Guards and create life. That will be the real creation of the world!" Now, I'm just stealing a small piece of land in the Silver Moon land. It's said that I'm splitting open the sky, but in fact ... I'm just stealing the sky and changing the sun to make myself look better. "Li Fuhai laughed.That was true.However, Li Hao was the only one who dared to say that. Even if it was a daylight thief, it was not something that ordinary people could do."If Lord Marquis can really walk out of the Silver Moon and create a new world, I think ... It won't be a problem.""Then let's look forward to that day! Silver Moon, I still haven't figured it out. "Li Hao laughed and quickly said,""Let's not care about them. I'm going to start setting up! Also ... There might be some changes this time. I'm not afraid of others, but I'm afraid that ... Someone will be unhappy that I've stolen a piece of the Silver Moon's world!""We will protect you, Lord Marquis!" Li Fuhai said in a deep voice."No... No need."Li Hao shook his head and said,"it's more eye-catching if we all gather here." All you need to do is help me with one thing! Right now, boundless city, heaven battling city, martial Union, and dingtian city are all in our hands. I need four Saint-level experts to take charge of these four cities and shake the world!""Heaven battling city will also descend ... Activating every large city is very troublesome ... General Huai will control heaven battling city, and martial Union has that monster Plant Guardian to hold down the Fort. I'll leave boundless city to you to control, and as for set heaven city ... Let the ninth Division commander handle it!"There weren't many saints on his side.The old turtle was still guarding the star Garrison ruins.Each of the four main cities would have to arrange for a Saint. In addition to Redwood's arrival, even with the addition of martial Union's Guardian monster plant, all six of the Saints had already been arranged.He wanted to stir up heaven and earth, interfere with heaven and earth, and interfere with heaven's will.It also included interfering with the Zheng family, li daoheng, and the others.Whether he could interfere or not, that was not a question. He would do it first.Li Fuhai's expression turned grave upon hearing this,'in that case, there are only Lord Marquis and Hong Mu here! Once ... Once we attract the attention of the Zheng family or Zhang an ... We'll be in great danger!"Even in heaven battling city, Li Hao wanted the other party to come, which made it even more dangerous.Once someone barged into this place ... It would not be safe.Li Hao was silent for a moment. Then, he said,""It's fine, wealth is found in danger! How can you chase after a half-step sovereign by relying on ordinary means? To deal with venerable sovereigns? Only by doing so will we have a chance to take risks!""You guys just do your own thing! In addition, the chaos had turned the world into a world, and there would be a great energy explosion! It's probably like this ... I've never experienced it before, so I'm just guessing. That's why I'll bring the others and see if I can take advantage of it! This time, the Saints aren't among them. Do you think this will cause dissatisfaction?""I won 't!"Li Fuhai immediately said,"Lord Marquis, just do it!" If we can produce a few more daomerge experts, it'll be our chance ..."While Li Hao was talking about Saints, it was talking about Dao integration.The daomerge had been named by Li Hao.Sage was the name of neo martial arts.One had to admit that li Fuhai was very interesting. This great demon was much smarter than ordinary humans.

Who wouldn't like such a person ... Such a demon?Li Hao smiled."Today is just a small test. I've stolen the sky and changed the sun. When I really split open the sky ... That will be the real opportunity!" At that time, I will not forget all of you!"Li Fuhai nodded and didn't say much.This was a little distant.Let's not be in a hurry for this."Then ... Do as I say!""Alright!"Li Fuhai quickly disappeared. His strength was actually stronger than the current limit of the world, but now that he had walked out in person, there were not many restrictions. There was always a force of heaven's will following him. It was Li Hao's control, but he didn't know how it was done.Meanwhile, Li Hao also began to make preparations.The divine runes disappeared one by one.Divine runes fell into the ground from all directions in the great wilderness.Gradually, a special force gushed out like a formation and began to envelop the entire great desolate land. However, it was on the verge of collapse.It wasn't until Sequoia returned quickly and took root in the wasteland with countless roots to help Li Hao stabilize the world that the domain was kept from breaking.The word "Dao" was floating in the center of the world.The power of the great DAOs was like chains that sealed off the great wastelands.In the vast wilderness, the White Horse was restless.It seemed to know what it was about to face.Outside the domain, a wave of heaven's will was slowly gathering.Li Hao himself walked out of the great wilderness, allowing the will of the heavens to focus on him.Not only that, but he also began to circle in the void and cultivate.The power of the great Dao spread in all directions.A passage appeared in the sky.Giant Dragons and even the Galaxy were circling around Li Hao.The commotion was so great that it attracted people's attention.As he caused such a huge commotion, more and more heaven's will gathered.Zheng Yu soon received the news again. He wondered what Li Hao was up to this time.To cause such a huge commotion in the great wilderness ... Could it be to eliminate the Qi of chaos in the great wilderness?That was a good thing!When the chaos dissipated, the world would certainly recover a little. Even if a half-step sovereign couldn't come out, a Heavenly King would be fine.…… On the moon in the void.At this moment, the moon was hovering above the great wilderness. It was as if it had automatically descended here with time. The great wilderness was the end of the East. The place where the sunrise was also the place where the moon set!The Heaven's Will shook, and the great Dao rampaged.On the moon, the man with the sword on his back said softly,"" 48 Dao meridians opened! He was truly a peerless genius! He's only cultivated for a short year, and he's already achieved so much ... He's indeed a proud son of this era!"  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Behind him, the statue asked softly,"what is he doing?" Banish the chaos of the great wilderness? Once a Heavenly King could walk out of the city ... There should be a Heavenly King in Hurricane city right? Not only in Hurricane city, there should also be one or two Heavenly Kings in the red moon ... Hiding somewhere else, right?"Li Hao would be in trouble then.He wouldn't be so unwise, right?He had paid a huge price to stop the second recovery.The man with the sword on his back pondered for a while and said slowly,""Great desolation ... Dao Meridian ... Chaos ... Domain ... Heaven's will ...""Let's wait and see. Maybe we'll have some new gains. Li Hao is getting more and more interesting. I'm afraid ... He's going to Steal the Sky!""What?"The sword-carrying man laughed,"sky-stealing sun-shifting!" Let's wait and see, I'm not too sure. Let's wait and see if the king of Dali will come ...""Is it related to the king of Dali?""The king of Dali is also favored by the will of heaven ..."After saying that, he felt a little regretful,'the one we chose ... Doesn't seem to be ... Very good! After all, he lacked training and experience. Compared to these guys who had climbed up on their own, there was a big gap! However, there is still some gathering of heaven's will ... Think of a way to transfer some memories to her, or let the Prophet God predict some things and see if you can take advantage of it ..."The statue was a little surprised. After thinking for a while, it said,""I kind of understand what you mean, but ... You're not going to stop me? "Even if the second generation comes and picks up some cheap stuff, it's just a little bit of it. We might be able to take it for ourselves ..." "Don't worry, it's just a small territory. What he did this time is good for us! Also, I didn't ask the second generation to come to pick up some soup and water. You've misunderstood!"The man with the sword explained,"if Li Hao really does what I want him to do and takes away a part of the Heaven's Will, the rest of the Heaven's Will will will hate him." At this moment, anyone who opposed Li Hao would be blessed by the will of heaven! As for the rest of the Heaven's Will, it would choose some people to bless ... For example, the second generation, Ying Hongyue, and the others. However, Ying Hongyue was a smart person, so he didn't dare to do it! So ... There's a high chance that he's a second generation!"He didn't care about picking up some soup and water.It was useless.He didn't ask the Queen to come to fight with Li Hao for the sudden burst of energy, but to obtain the remaining blessings of heaven's will.How big was the great wilderness?A little bit bigger!If the king of Dali, Li Hao, and the others entered the vast wilderness, the Heaven's Will would turn hostile. If they cut off the flesh of the Heaven's Will, how could the rest of the Heaven's Will not turn hostile?Then wouldn't he have to find someone to rely on?"You ..." The moon goddess finally understood."You're still a pure human. You think more!"She had thought that the other party had called the second generation over to pick up some leftovers that Li Hao didn't want.This person instantly thought of plotting to seize the remaining heaven's will.Her brain was spinning too fast, and she almost couldn't react. He had already thought of the next step before she had even done it.

The man laughed."It's only within the scope of ordinary people's thinking. I can only say that you all ... Lack the ability to think for yourself. Think more ... Forget it, it's fine if you don't think. Emperor Cang doesn't like to think about anything. It's fine as long as you're strong enough. Thinking too much is actually very tiring!"Yueshen didn't continue on this topic and said,""The Li Dynasty ...""Don't worry about it. I know what that fellow is thinking ... As long as we don't worry about it, he won't care about what we do. Our interests don't clash too much yet!""Is he very strong?" the moon goddess asked."He's quite powerful! It's just that ... Anyway, you don't have to worry too much about it now. ""Yes."Yueshen did not say anything more. "Hong Yue hasn't been doing much lately. She's been cultivating in silence," he said after a pause."Him? After all, venerable sovereigns were not to be underestimated. There was a high probability that they were looking for an opportunity to break the seal! Ying Hongyue was currently absorbing the inheritances of the eight great families and might have the chance to step into the Heavenly King realm! To him, it's not a good thing that the seal is powerful, but ... If Ying Hongyue is powerful, it'll be easier for her to get in touch with him ... There are both advantages and disadvantages!"After thinking for a while, the man with the sword said,""Venerable sovereigns are still very strong. We can't really think that he's dead, like a turtle in a jar! This guy might have already figured something out. Try to test him again and use the Silver Moon to suppress him!""Okay ... But the amount of Crimson Moon Power he's been releasing is very little ... It's already very difficult for me to extract a large amount of it.""It's fine. It seems that he has indeed guessed something. However, it has been so many years and he has only just guessed it. His mind is not very clear. There is no need to worry about it."After conversing for a while, the sword-carrying man smiled and said,""It's actually even more interesting now! It would be boring if Zheng Yu and the others were the only ones showing off! There was no fun at all, which also meant that ... The potential of the Silver Moon world was too small! There was not even the slightest sign of a counterattack, so how could he take a step further? "Whether or not a world is powerful depends on whether or not it can give birth to powerful chosen ....""However, in this case, it will be full of variables."Yueshen said worriedly.The sword-bearing man shook his head,"no, no, no, you still don't understand!" Fighting with a group of mediocre people, he would become mediocre sooner or later! Only by going through trials and tribulations would one have the hope of rising to the next level! "If chaos isn't too strong and we aren't too weak, we can go to chaos and fight with the world Lords and great Dao Masters. Only then can we improve! However, we haven't even learned how to run, so flying is even more difficult! If we succeed this time, we'll be able to fly!"After saying that, he laughed and said,'you'll be stronger if you win against a group of heaven's favorites! If you lose ... That means you're not a chosen. You can only accept your fate! I also regret that there are too few heavenly talents in this era. The only one who has truly emerged is Li Hao! However, this guy is so young, but his mind is so deep. He can match up to several people, not bad!" Yueshen had never asked, but today she asked,""Where's Zheng Yu?""Him?"The sword-bearing man pondered for a long time before he smiled."Not bad."Not bad?Yueshen's heart skipped a beat. She thought he would say "trash" and "vulnerable." He was very proud and actually said "Zheng Yu" was good.The sword-carrying man seemed to know what she was thinking. He chuckled and said, "It's not bad! It wasn't difficult at all. To be able to cultivate to the Heavenly King realm pinnacle, his talent was first rate. This was something that was beyond doubt! His intelligence ... Was actually not bad! At least, he knows how to make some seemingly impossible plans ... The only flaw is that he's too timid!"His evaluation of Zheng Yu did not seem to be low.He only felt that the other party was too timid.Yueshen was still digesting all this, and after a long time, she said,""Between him and Li Hao, who do you think is more likely to become our future enemy?"" 50 - 50!"The man with the sword on his back laughed."Other than the two of them ... There's another problem. Zhang an has been looking for me. He might find me soon. This guy is so free!""Just kill him ..." Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ "It's not that easy. Even though he's only barely reached the limits of a Sage and isn't even a Heavenly King ... This fellow ... Is not to be trifled with! "Previously, he was only thinking about waiting. He knew that neo martial was only a few years old, so he wasn't in a hurry. However, Li Hao rose too quickly. He should be worried that Li Hao would run away after swallowing Silver Moon. Then, he wouldn't have a chance to find neo martial. Now, he's in a hurry to find trouble with me ... What a slow person!"After saying that, he smiled and said,"alright, let's not talk about this. Let's wait!" The current Li Hao is still too young. For now, that venerable sovereign is the biggest threat. No matter how strong they are, no matter how smart they are, they can't fight against ten opponents!"Yueshen didn't say anything else. She just wanted to think of a way to get that stupid second-generation to get this opportunity. She was a little helpless about how he was always one step slower than others.
