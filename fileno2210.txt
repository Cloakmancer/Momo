Everyone, including Black Panther, was shocked by this scene!At that moment, the chaos Dao Meridian in Li Hao's body trembled violently. The White Horse roared, and Li Hao also roared. Divine runes and Dao meridians appeared in the sky.Li Hao gritted his teeth. His body cracked as he laughed."Chaos enter my body. Heaven and earth open for me!"BOOM!The domain retracted!At that moment, a total of 36 divine runes appeared. With the word 'Dao' as the main divine rune, they turned into 36 Dao meridians, all of which were divine power Dao meridians.A total of 48 Dao meridians appeared in Li Hao's body.They all had attribute-less Dao meridians.A total of 84 Dao meridians appeared like 84 giant Dragons. Among them, 83 giant Dragons merged into the chaos giant dragon."Stop him!"The Queen's expression changed drastically, and she charged out in an instant!Black Panther and the others were extremely surprised and shocked!They had not expected this to happen.Li Hao, on the other hand, was not simply asking the Black Panther to devour the chaos will and the will of heaven. Instead ... He was going to devour the heaven!It was too unexpected!Everyone felt a majestic force at this moment.Li Hao swallowed the world, and Da Huang was rapidly being compressed. With a rumbling sound, Da Huang was quickly compressed into a huge ball, which surged into Li Hao's body.Li Hao's body cracked and even exploded!However, at this moment, the strength of his power had also far exceeded that of before. With the chaos sword in hand, he slashed out!BOOM!The five Saints were all sent flying back, their faces filled with shock.So strong?Li Hao frowned slightly. Not enough!He glanced at the Queen. The Heaven's Will on this person was too strong. The Heaven's Will was even strengthening her, so she was very strong ... He was not strong enough to kill them.On the other hand, Ying Hongyue and the other two felt the sky Fall and the earth crack. Their expressions changed. They originally wanted to come, but when they saw Li Hao suddenly turn into a chaos giant, their expressions changed drastically. The three of them who had originally wanted to come all retreated a few steps.Li Hao frowned slightly. He looked at them and smiled.""It seems like ... You guys can still hold on for a while!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  With that, he used his Primal Chaos as a sword, and great desolation entered his body.Heaven and earth turned into chaos, and heaven's will quickly surged into their bodies. Their strength increased again. At this moment, Li Hao could no longer mobilize the People's hearts. The People's hearts were complicated, and one time was enough. It would not be very effective if he used it again. Heaven's will was also resistant.He transformed into a chaos giant and struck out again and again. In the blink of an eye, the five of them were forced to retreat. At this moment, they represented heaven's will, and Li Hao represented chaos!Both sides seemed to be evenly matched.……On the moon. "You have some skills!" The sword-carrying man exclaimed.It was the first time he had used the People's hearts to create chaos and killed a few people. He was not surprised, not surprised at all.However ... This time, Li Hao had devoured the will of chaos of the great wilderness, and chaos had directly entered his body. The heaven and earth had entered his body. He was surprised. This guy had actually forcefully devoured the heaven and earth. No wonder he was so confident!"He's very strong ..." The moon goddess said."He's even close to the Heavenly King level ... He's only opened more than 80 Dao meridians. Logically speaking, he should only be in the middle stage of the Saint level ... He's almost at the peak of the Saint level ...""It's not the same. He's supported by the will of chaos, the great Dao, and the divine arts ... He's also a top-notch swordsman. Don't treat him like an ordinary Saint!"Yueshen didn't say anything else and said,""If this continues ... The second-generation might not be able to defeat him ... Of course, the will of heaven is only a part of it, so there might still be a chance ... Should I inject some more Silver Moon Power into the second-generation so that he can quickly level up ..."The five of them still had a chance.Li Hao was forcefully devouring the world. His body wasn't strong enough, so he had to stop it as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would self-destruct at any moment.As long as the five of them could hold on for a while and not be killed by Li Hao, they would still have a chance.Of course, such an opportunity ... Might not be something these people could grasp.The sword-carrying man laughed and said,"input some!" I also want to see what Li Hao's limit is!"The moon goddess didn't say anything. The moon was shining.At this moment, the Queen's expression changed slightly. In an instant, a wave of Silver Moon Power entered her body, recovering her strength instantly and even increasing it rapidly!The five of them had been retreating, but at this moment, the Queen's staff blocked Li Hao's chaos sword!The other powerhouses heaved a sigh of relief.At this moment, Li Hao laughed.""The power of the Silver Moon has increased again!"He looked at the sky.You guys are cheating again!If you hadn't cheated again and again ... I'm afraid you wouldn't have been able to defeat me!Since you're cheating, I won't be polite either.With a loud roar, Li Hao's armor glowed.At that moment, a frenzied massacre erupted in the divine Kingdom region. Puppets appeared in the sky above the divine Kingdom cities. Without a few gods keeping watch, divine halls were destroyed in the blink of an eye, and countless believers were killed!Lin Hongyu stood at the edge of the divine Kingdom and looked at the Li Army. She shouted coldly,""Retreat!"On the Li Dynasty's side, generals appeared one after another.They were all furious!"Retreat!" Lin Hongyu shouted again."This place ... Will be under the control of heavenstar!""You guys are going too far!"Some of the Li Dynasty's generals were extremely furious. This was too much of a bully.But ... She didn't dare to do anything to this person.If he attacked, there was a high probability that he would not be a match.They were all looking forward to the God of beginner's attack again. He would kill this woman with one punch. How hateful!In order to break into the divine Kingdom, they had paid a great price. In the end, this woman actually asked them to retreat.

Just as they were furious, a sigh resounded through the world.""Retreat to Li Dynasty!"The expressions of the generals who had been indignant changed. The next moment, they roared without saying anything,""Obey the Divine Will, retreat!"Lin Hongyu looked into the distance and seemed to see a shadow. She frowned slightly but did not speak.Behind her, the killing continued.A blood-curdling screech resounded through the heavens!Lin Hongyu took out a flag and raised it in the wind, covering the divine Kingdom's capital in the distance. Countless believers flew into the sky. They were all strong cultivators, and they wanted to stop the Tiger flag from falling.However, they were all killed in an instant! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ The flag exuded an extremely dense murderous aura.A scimitar appeared in Lin Hongyu's hand and she laughed,""I haven't killed for many days!"Who would believe that she had once controlled the city of superpowers with over a million superpowers?Many people thought that she was a gentle woman.However, back then ... She had almost destroyed the Lin family and pledged her allegiance to Li Hao. Who would believe that she was a butcher?The scimitar swept across the world!Countless corpses fell to the ground, and blood filled the air. The seventh level of the sun Moon realm, which was above the peak of immortal realm, swept across the area.Without a Saint to stop her, no one could stop her from massacring.The Queen of the West ... Had actually left with all the gods. What an idiot!She was prepared to fight with the Saints, but in the end, not a single one was left."Destroy all the temples and kill all the believers who resist!""Yes!"The response resounded through the heavens and earth as the puppets went on a frenzied rampage, destroying the divine temple.Boom! Boom! Boom!"God ... Save us ...""Moon goddesses, save us!""Where did the God go?"“……”First, the Army was massacred, then the gods were killed, then the Li Dynasty invaded, and then they abandoned a large piece of land. Today, countless temples were destroyed, and believers were killed ...Suddenly, the divine Kingdom began to collapse.The collapse of faith!Where is our God?Why was it that despite being massacred time and time again, he didn't see the majesty of a God, only death?"Moon god ... Prophet God ... You are all fake gods!" He shouted.Some of the believers let out a shrill roar at the last moment.His God nation had been massacred!Where have you all been?The Temple was destroyed, the believers who trusted you the most were killed, the city was destroyed ... Why can't I see you saving us?BOOM!The divine Kingdom's sky suddenly began to collapse with a large amount of faith energy! ……On the moon.The statue of the moon goddess, who was feeding energy to the Queen, suddenly cracked. The next moment, she roared in anger,""Dammit! Damn it! You should die!"Three in a row!The Silver Moon trembled, and so did the moon in the sky. Some of the statues were damaged, and some of them were broken. The sword-carrying man's expression changed slightly. He turned his head to take a look, but it was as if he hadn't seen it clearly. In the next moment, the moon suddenly disappeared from its original spot and flew towards the divine Kingdom.Not long after, they saw the tragic scene below. Countless cities were destroyed and countless believers were killed!Rivers of blood!The believers roared in grief and indignation, calling for their God, but they did not get a response, so they abandoned their faith!The power of faith began to collapse!The sword-bearing man's expression changed slightly as he looked in the direction of the great wilderness and muttered,""I thought you wouldn't do that ... You ... You're more vicious than I thought and knew!"Li Hao had ordered Lin Hongyu to lead her people to slaughter Scandinavia!This was a group of the weakest apex experts. At this moment, they were massacring a group of weaklings who were at most at the mountain sea realm. There were over a hundred of them, and in an instant, they could kill thousands or even tens of thousands.In just a short while, at least tens of millions of people from God nation had been killed!Resentment soared to the sky!The smell of blood filled the air!Li Hao was even more ruthless than he had imagined.Behind him, yueshen was a little weak and angry.""Damn it, they destroyed the faith of the divine Kingdom ..."An undeserved calamity!She was taking the blame for the second generation.The true Moon goddesses were not as useless or useless as the believers had imagined them to be. However ... The moon goddesses in everyone's hearts were the Queen, and the Queen had been defeated time and time again, lowering the believers 'expectations.This time, it was a brutal massacre!All of a sudden, all the accumulated resentment, dissatisfaction, and despair caused the faith of these believers to collapse.The man with the sword on his back also frowned slightly.This time, he had misjudged. He had seen Li Hao's previous actions, but Li Hao had ordered his men to slaughter Scandinavia ... He had never expected this. This didn't match the image of a swordsman in his mind, nor the image Li Hao usually displayed.This Li Hao ... Was extremely cold-blooded, even more cold-blooded than the neo martial King!Although the human Emperor was ruthless, he would not massacre the civilians who posed no threat ..."Li Hao!"The sword-carrying man muttered. The next moment, he said in a low voice,""Tell the second-generation successor to quickly escape! Her faith will collapse ... And her God Country will fall. Even if heaven's will supports her, it will cause a conflict between her faith and heaven's will ..." The moon goddess didn't dare to say anything more and quickly transmitted her thoughts for the Queen to sense.……At this moment, in the great wilderness.The Queen had obtained a large amount of the Silver Moon's power, and her strength had increased rapidly. However, all of a sudden, her expression changed drastically, and with a loud boom, waves of divine power collapsed and spread out from her body!Seeing this, Li Hao's eyes flickered, and so did the other two gods. They were all greatly shocked!At this moment, Li Hao slashed out with his sword, like an assassin in the dark!Puchi!It directly pierced through the Prophet God, and his voice sounded in his ears,""Thank the moon goddess for me. Thank her for sending me more Silver Moon Power ..." He said.

Kachaa!The Prophet's expression changed drastically, and his body instantly shattered.Li Hao turned around and punched. With a loud bang, the God of fate was completely shattered. He shook his head."The God of beginner's martial told you last time that the weak should not change the fate of the strong. You're disobedient!"Bang! Bang!His divine body exploded!The two deities were killed by him in an instant. However, their Natal stars were not in the Dao universe, so Li Hao couldn't kill them completely. However, they probably couldn't be resurrected in a short time!The Queen continued to vomit blood with disbelief. In her mind, there seemed to be a thought ... Escape!The expressions of the two new martial Saints also changed drastically!He was cursing and swearing!How did this happen?Just now, the Queen had shown her unparalleled strength, and in the blink of an eye, three gods were crippled. F * ck, were these gods made of paper?There were too many changes this time.On the outside, Ying Hongyue exhaled. I knew it!As expected!Li Hao was getting more and more sinister. Something must have happened to his divine Kingdom, which caused the faith of the gods to collapse.Over a dozen Saints had made their move, but in the blink of an eye, only three were left.These three ... Whether or not they could escape was still a problem."Let's go!"He shouted in a low voice and looked at the remaining two people. The two of them were still a little hesitant. Ying Hongyue shouted in a low voice,"If we don't leave now, we won't be able to! Once he has killed these people and completed the devouring of heaven's will ... We will all die!"The two saints 'expressions changed. At that moment, they screamed. One of them was killed on the spot by Li Hao, while the other one gathered energy and was about to self-destruct!Seeing that they were about to die, the two of them couldn't care about anything else. With some fear, they frantically fled with Ying Hongyue!They didn't know how it ended up like this.There were so many powerhouses ... They could kill a Heavenly King!Why did it suddenly disappear?The Heaven's Will actually failed to defeat Li Hao. Instead, it caused all those blessed by the Heaven's Will to step into the state of death!Behind him, a loud boom rang out!The last new martial Saint chose to self-destruct, and the sound of the explosion reverberated throughout the world.The Queen continued to bleed!Just when she thought she had nowhere to run and was about to die, Li Hao suddenly laughed and said softly,""Expel the Heaven's Will and I'll let you go!"The Queen was stunned.The next moment, without saying anything, he instantly expelled a sword from his body. At this time, a small hole appeared in the void. The Heaven's Will also seemed to want to escape, but it was suppressed by Li Hao's sword!Seeing this, the Queen ran away madly without looking back!At this moment, the opening instantly recovered after she left. "Lord Marquis!"Near the entrance, the Redwood was a little surprised. Why?Li Hao had let the Queen go!Why was this so?"She's a good person!"Li Hao smiled. “……”Everyone was stunned. She had just joined forces with everyone to kill you!"She's a good person. She gave me the physical strength of 12 Saints to consolidate the New World! She gathered more heaven's will for me and brought me a large amount of the Silver Moon's power. As long as she's alive, she'll be the moon goddess!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao laughed!He laughed crazily!At this moment, he seemed to be particularly crazy.He raised his head and looked at the sky!The moon goddess?The number one God in the world?Why don't you kill the queen yourself!Otherwise, as long as the Queen is alive, she'll kill all of you sooner or later ... I look forward to this day. You've contributed countless Silver Moon Power and faith power, and now, they're all mine!This time, if it wasn't for the Queen's actions and her display of unparalleled combat power, those few neo martial Saints might not have dared to attack ... I've earned enough in one go!The Queen was a good person.From start to finish, it has already given me countless benefits.This time's failure ... The next time ... It might come back again. He didn't know if it would bring him a lot of benefits the next time!Li Hao's smile was brilliant!……On the Silver Moon.Yueshen did not say a word, and the man with the sword raised his eyebrows slightly, but did not say anything.Li Hao ... Was about to succeed.This was an unexpected result. The key was the second-generation successor. He had obtained the blessing of heaven, the power of the Silver Moon, and everything else ... But he had been defeated by Li Hao in an instant!It really ... Made one feel helpless!"Let's just kill her ..." Yueshen said after a long while."If this goes on, yueshen ... Will become the world's laughingstock!"This was too infuriating!In the eyes of everyone in Scandinavia, yueshen had already become a loser!Their faith had collapsed!He had never felt so aggrieved in his countless years as a deity.

Chapter 2213 Who's More Ruthless Than Who (3)_1
In the great wilderness.A chaos giant stood between heaven and earth. It was Li Hao.Li Hao was laughing wildly.In the air, the small sword that was forced out by the Queen was still floating in the air. It seemed to be a little angry. The will of heaven was still there.However, those blessed by the Heaven's Will were all dead."You should also be on your way!"Li Hao looked at the divine sword and then at the sky. The Silver Moon had disappeared.At this moment, there was only this small sword of heaven's will.As for the Heaven's Will in the outside world, it had disappeared. Perhaps it had gone to find someone else, perhaps Lin Hongyu, or perhaps Ying Hongyue ... In short, there was no heaven's will in the outside world that had gathered again."Heibao! Swallow it!"Li Hao looked at Black Panther, who was somewhat confused.You've already devoured the chaos heaven's will, so why do you still want me to devour the Heaven's Will small sword?Just as he was thinking, Li Hao's breath suddenly weakened, and he spat out a White Horse. Everyone was shocked. Why?Li Hao devoured the chaos heaven's will and then the Heaven's Will smallsword. If the two sides were neutralized, perhaps he could really open a small world that belonged to him. But now, after killing all the enemies, he actually spat out chaos will.Sequoia and the others were all surprised.They then looked at Black Panther ... No one said anything, still confused.Was there any point in forcefully upgrading the Black Panther?Li Hao smiled and said,"no hurry!" 'If I were to devour the Heaven's Will and the chaos will, it would be difficult for me to survive in this world!' Now that the Black Panther has devoured it ... The Black Panther can't move an inch, but I'm not a big problem! The Heaven's Will is as ignorant as a child. I beat it up today, and the part that was beaten up was all killed. Those that weren't beaten up might not remember what happened here. "Do you think Tianyi is a fool?Everyone was speechless.Li Hao, on the other hand, was smiling brightly. He was acting like a fool.As long as my aura changes, it won't know if I'm Li Hao, Wang Hao, or Zhang Hao ..."Heaven's will had yet to mature again.What was there to be afraid of?Now that he had devoured this heaven's will, the aura would remain, and people would remember him."Black Panther, swallow it," he shouted again."After you're done, we still have things to do!"There's still something to do?  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  The Black Panther did not dare to say anything more. It roared and its devouring power burst forth, engulfing the entire world. It swallowed the White Horse that it had just spat out and continued to battle with the Heaven's Will.Li Hao didn't care about it. At this time, Li Hao's aura began to decline.His combat strength, which had been comparable to a Heavenly King, dropped again.At this moment, in the distance, a figure quickly flew through the air. It was the old turtle. At this moment, the old turtle was extremely nervous and uneasy. He shouted from far away,""Not good, star suppression city has been occupied ..."With that, the old turtle landed on the ground, his body covered in wounds and his shell shattered. He was a little embarrassed."That ... Zheng Yu's clone went to the ruins of star suppression city. I can't defeat him, I ..." It was really unrivaled, so it ran away.If he didn't run, he would die!However, this was considered a deserter. He had abandoned the city and the land in neo martial and was directly beheaded.Therefore, the old turtle was very uneasy.Li Hao, on the other hand, was calm! Zheng Yu had his eyes on the star Town City for a long time, but his clone didn't come. Instead, Ying Hongyue came. I knew that he would most likely go to the star Town ruins. "The other party was a half-step sovereign. Even if it was only a saint's clone, the old turtle's combat strength was average. It was normal that he couldn't match the other party.As for escaping ...If he didn't escape, he would die, so it was normal to escape."Lord Marquis, this ...""It's fine!"Li Hao was unconcerned."Don't worry about this," he quickly said."Let's enter the wasteland!"The old turtle quickly entered the wasteland. Seeing that Black Panther and the others were still besieging the divine sword, he was a little confused. Why isn't li Hao doing anything?Li Hao looked at the sky.In the next moment, he leaped up and pierced through the void. His voice reverberated within the sphere that Da Huang had transformed into,""Black Panther, quickly swallow it ... When I need it, you can fuse with the will of the two heavens ... Now, I'm going to take everyone to Silver City!"Everyone was stunned. Why would they go to the Silver City?"Go to the silver Blizzard city ... And enter the seal! Let's see if we can defeat Silvermoon's true body. "Everyone was stunned, and the old turtle hurriedly said,""Lord Marquis, are you going to break the seal?""No, breaking the Silver Moon doesn't necessarily mean breaking the seal ... Instead, it might restrict an expert! Let the power she took away return to her!"She was talking about the true Moon Goddess!The real Moon Goddess must have taken away a lot of energy long ago. Now that she had destroyed the original body she had left behind, she would definitely choose to return the energy she had taken away in order to prevent the venerable sovereign from breaking the seal.The fusion of the two heavenly wills would definitely produce an instantaneous explosive power that was unparalleled! There was a high chance of success!Of course, it was very dangerous.So what?The red moon sovereign might kill him, but Li Hao wasn't afraid. If the red moon sovereign could kill him, it meant that the seal could be broken. Once the seal was broken, it would ruin everyone's plan. At that time, li daoheng and Zheng Yu would both cry.Li Hao was still the weakest of the four.They lacked sufficient top-notch experts!Therefore, Li Hao wasn't worried about releasing a top-tier expert.Holding the giant ball in his hand, Li Hao dashed toward the North.Zheng Yu's clone was currently in the ruins of star suppression city ... Zheng Yu was very powerful, but every time he created a saint's clone, it would be a kind of consumption. Even if he wanted to stop him ... How many saint's clones could he create?

Chapter 2214 Who's More Ruthless Than Who (3)_2
And how many saints could still come out of Hurricane city?Eight of them had died all of a sudden, and the other two were currently fleeing with Ying Hongyue. Whether they could escape or not was a problem.Were there really an endless number of Saints?This was an opportunity!As for star suppression city ... If your clone can occupy it, then so be it. If you can't occupy it, then you can't take the blood Emperor's weapon. If you stay here, sooner or later, your clone will be killed!Li Hao was extremely fast.He carried the vast wilderness and headed straight north.……At the same time.North, Silver Moon.BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the heavens and earth.In an instant, a huge city was suspended in the air. In Hurricane city, Zheng Yu's expression was unsightly. He quickly appeared at the edge of the city and looked not far away. Over there, Star River City was floating. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ "Zhang an!"At this moment, the Galaxy city was floating in the air. Zhang an stood on the top of the city, looking into the distance at Zheng Yu. His expression was as cold and indifferent as ever."The Zhou family has rebelled, they must be executed!"After saying that, he looked at Zheng Yu in the distance and said softly,""The Zheng family ... Will be no exception!"Zheng Yu's expression turned ugly. At this moment, within Hurricane city, a series of auras began to stir. One by one, the Saints were infuriated, and there were even Saints from the Zhou clan who were gritting their teeth!Star River City was close to Hurricane city, so there were still Saints who had come to Hurricane city.However, there were also Saints left behind to guard the star River City.After all, it was a main city.In the end, Zhang an and his men had quietly seized the star River City without even attracting the attention of the Zhou family. It was obvious that as the grandson of a Supreme martial artist, this guy had many means and had invaded the star River City without anyone knowing.At this moment, Zheng Yu kept frowning.Heavy losses!There were two saints in the star River City, but it seemed like they had been killed. As for the 10 Saints who had gone out ... From the looks of it, they probably did not have a good ending. It seemed like someone had died in the great wilderness of the East.However, the Heaven's Will was trembling, the big cities in all directions were stirring the world, and the great Dao was not broken. At present, he could not judge the specific situation.He did not expect Zhang an to do this at this time.Zheng Yu's expression turned ugly.Just as he was thinking about this, the city suddenly floated up into the sky. Zheng Yu's expression changed and he shouted angrily,""Don't you dare!"At this moment, this guy was actually trying to drive the ancient city into the seal!Zhang an ignored him.Do you dare or not ... You can't come out, so why are you shouting?Zheng Yu was furious. He instantly created a clone and shouted,""Saint, follow me out of the city!"In an instant, the clone walked out of the ancient city. Not only that, but a large number of Saints followed behind him. At first glance, there were at least 20 Saints, and 10 had already left. Several had been killed ...If these were all the sages, it meant that the Zheng family had recruited at least 30 sages over the years. The land of Silver Moon didn't have many saints to begin with. It was obvious that the Zheng family had prepared a lot of cultivation resources for Silver Moon.In the city, there was still a group of people who didn't go out. They might all be Heavenly Kings or undying beings.At this moment, Zheng Yu's clone walked out with an ashen face. He threw a punch at the giant city and shouted coldly,""You're courting death!"In the star River City, many saints also appeared.Not much.Including Zhang an, there were only five of them.Martial Union's second elder, as well as martial Union's fourth elder, who was in charge of military affairs, were both at the Saint realm.The Zhang family's dingtian city had only produced one Saint. It was the Deputy commander of the dingtian Army. The Guardian monster plant had betrayed the Army and was killed by the Zhang family.The last Saint was somewhat unexpected. He seemed to be a God, but he was faintly discernible and could not be seen clearly.Zhang an drove the ancient city and flew straight into the sky.At the front, Zheng Yu led dozens of Saints to block the way. They were even prepared to enter the city and kill these bastards on the spot!How detestable!These people were all troublesome.BOOM!A loud sound reverberated, shaking the heavens and earth. Countless buildings in the Silver City were destroyed in an instant. There was no one here. At this moment, the tall buildings collapsed, and the earth cracked.Even a stone door underground appeared.Zhang an drove the ancient city and charged forward!A city Lord seal was floating in the air.All of a sudden, the city Lord seal burst forth with a powerful light, and Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly. A human figure seemed to have emerged from the city Lord seal, and it had actually overlapped with Zhang an.This was the mark left by Zhang an's grandfather, the Supreme martial artist.In the past, director Wang had used this to kill a crippled Saint.However, in Zhang an's hands, the power seemed to be even greater!BOOM!The light that burst out even caused some Saints to feel a little suffocated. Zhang an charged straight into the sky and earth, not getting entangled with Zheng Yu and the others. The ancient city followed one of the red lines and was about to forcefully merge into the seal.Zheng Yu was extremely angry and shouted,""Zhang an, what good would it do you to break the seal?""Who's going to break the seal?"Zhang an's voice was calm."Let's go in and have a look. What does suppressing the venerable sovereigns have to do with you?" Zheng Yu ... The seal ... Might not be that easy to break. What are you worried about?"Zheng Yu's expression was ugly. He knew that the seal might not be easy to break.However, what if he really broke it?'Damn it!'The two sides were entangled in the air, and Zhang an was constantly frowning. Although they had seized Galaxy city, Zheng Yu's reaction was very fast, and he immediately led the remaining Saints to stop them. If they continued to waste a lot of their strength here ... They might not be able to deal with Silvermoon's main body once they entered the seal.Just as he was hesitating.Suddenly, both of their expressions changed.In the distance, a primal energy swept over.

Chapter 2215 Who Is More Ruthless Than Who (3)
With the might of heaven and earth, Li Hao flew over with chaotic aura around him!Seeing Zheng Yu walking out with a large number of Saints ... And seeing Zhang an seizing the ancient city of Xing He as if he was about to enter the seal, his expression changed slightly. Suddenly, he looked at the Black Panther and shouted through voice transmission,""Devour, explode, fuse!"At this moment, the Black Panther suddenly swallowed the Heaven's Will.In an instant, BOOM!The Black Panther's body expanded rapidly and instantly turned into an extremely huge and terrifying dog.The big dog's body turned golden, then gray, then chaotic, then white ... The colors kept changing, and it roared madly and wailed in pain.In his body, two heaven's will were entangled and collided with each other. There was a loud boom as if the world had just been created.The entire compressed great wilderness was also turned upside down. With a loud rumble, a huge change was born.Countless amounts of energy burst out rapidly.Between the heaven and earth, there were even weak figures of the great Dao.At this moment, Li Hao sent another message."Gather your ancestral bloodline and give them a blow!"The Black Panther roared, and a giant Golden Horn appeared on its head. In the next moment, lightning flashed, mixed with chaos intent, and exploded, bombarding Zheng Yu and the others in the distance!BOOM!The heavens and earth were turned upside down!The void exploded as the Saints roared. Under Zheng Yu's lead, they attacked the lightning!Bang Bang Bang!Lightning exploded, and many saints were scorched. Zheng Yu's clone was also in a sorry state. At this time, Zhang an turned to look at Li Hao and suddenly drove the ancient city toward the seal!Li Hao raised his eyebrows. Zhang an ... Was also going to enter the seal.He had thought that this fellow would not appear.But now, they had seized the ancient city of the Milky Way.If he went in ... He might not be able to go in.On Zheng Yu's side, there were many saints who were furious. On Li Hao's side, the Black Panther was still roaring. Although its aura was strong, it was likely to explode because it had barely increased its power.Without the will of chaos, Li Hao's combat strength was not as good as before.If he really fought with these Saints ... He might not be able to get any benefits.The massive star River City was merging with the seal.Zheng Yu's face turned ashen as he once again created a clone of himself in the city. As long as he was willing to cut himself up and turn himself into a clone, it would be fine. However, in that case, even if one of them died, it would be a huge loss to him.If he split too much, he wouldn't even have the strength of a half-Emperor."Li Hao!"Zheng Yu shouted in a low voice, and a clone flew toward the seal again. The clone led many saints toward Li Hao and said coldly,""You're really bold!""At this moment ... Can you enter the great Dao universe?"As soon as he finished speaking, the Saints attacked at the same time.The sky was torn apart in an instant, and countless forces swept over. Li Hao quickly turned around and fled.Since Zhang an had entered, he did not want to go in. However, Li Hao didn't run around. Instead, he flew straight into the sky. Behind him, Saints were chasing after him. Li Hao kept flying upward, breaking through the void and shattering the astral winds.In the back, Zheng Yu frowned slightly.If he kept flying ... He would be flying into the barrier between heaven and earth. At that time, Li Hao might not be able to escape.Was this guy so flustered that he couldn't choose where he was going?……At the same time.In the sky, above the Silver Moon.The man with the sword on his back didn't say a word. He just silently looked at everything below. Today, the world was changing!Zhang an forcefully entered the seal with the ancient city.Li Hao took the great wilderness heaven and earth to the sky. On the divine Kingdom's side, Lin Hongyu was still slaughtering with her puppets. She had actually received some blessings from heaven's will. It seemed that heaven's will had no choice but to choose Lin Hongyu.The four ancient cities were still absorbing heaven and earth energy in all directions, shaking the surroundings and interfering with heaven's will.Right now, Zheng Yu was leading a large number of Saints in pursuit of Li Hao. They were heading straight for World's End.

In that case ... It was very likely that he was here to deal with him.Yueshen was also a little helpless.Today, everything was not going smoothly.These people were really bold. There was a venerable sovereign over there. Did they all think he was dead?"I know,"The man with the sword looked down at Li Hao, who was rapidly approaching, and said in a low voice,""It seems that Li Hao has really guessed it."It was very likely that Li Hao had come straight for them to lure Zheng Yu into dealing with him.It wasn 't' might '... It was' definitely '.If Zheng Yu found out that the moon in the sky was not a projection, but a real moon ... What would his reaction be?All along, everyone had thought that this bright moon was the projection of the Silver Moon near the Stargate."But ... Will he be able to find out?"The sword-bearing man chuckled. At this moment, the moon suddenly became illusionary. The next moment, it was as if the sky had split open. The Silver Moon turned into a silver light and disappeared. However, it still left behind some afterimages, just like the real moon.The huge moon body disappeared from the world.In the distance, Li Hao's expression changed.The great Dao universe!As expected!The other party had moved the Silver Moon into the great Dao universe!An illusory universe of the great path!The universe of the great path really had two sides.Li daoheng was in charge of the other side, and the moon that was left behind was the real projection."I've finally confirmed it!"Li Hao muttered and turned around. Zheng Yu was still chasing after him with his men in anger.

Chapter 2216 Who's More Ruthless Than Who (3)_4
He brought the great wilderness heaven and earth with him, so it would not be easy for him to enter the Dao universe.Heibao had yet to stabilize.At this moment, there were also four large cities approaching from all directions. They were Saints who were coming to rescue.Behind them, Zheng Yu seemed to have made up his mind to get rid of Li Hao.As for Zhang an ... He didn't care.What else could they do when they were already inside?As for Li Hao, not a single one of the 10 Saints that had gone out with Ying Hongyue had returned ... To Zheng Yu, the Zheng family had spent a lot of effort to nurture the Saints one by one. He had suffered such a heavy loss ... Even if he didn't kill Li Hao, he had to force him to give up the vast wilderness.He was a half-step Emperor after all. At this moment, he could see some clues.Li Hao was actually going to devour a part of the world, although it was not big!Of course, it didn't seem like Li Hao was devouring them, but rather the descendants of the demon guardians. But it was all the same. He wouldn't give Li Hao the chance."Li Hao, hand over Da Huang! You can only survive if you escape into the great Dao universe ... Otherwise, you won't be able to survive today!"Zheng Yu's clone was incomparably cold. As he struck out with his palm, heaven and earth trembled. A palm print instantly appeared behind Li Hao. The two saints, Redwood, and old turtle blocked it at the same time. Bang Bang! The two saints were actually on the verge of collapse from the attacks of the other party's clone.It was extremely powerful!At this moment, Li Hao turned around and suddenly smiled.""Zheng Yu ... You're really not afraid of death!"Zheng Yu was stunned. What other means do you have?"Black Panther ... Self-destructed heaven's will and chaos will!"At this moment, Li Hao was extremely cold. He sent a message to Lin Hongyu through the armor."Lin Hongyu, self-destruct your great Dao! Just leave one main Dao...The rest will self-destruct!"In the divine Kingdom, Lin Hongyu was also stunned.However, he didn't think much and just followed his orders.Not only that, but at this moment, countless divine runes appeared on Li Hao's body. In an instant, all the divine runes exploded and turned into giant Dragons of the great path. All of them suddenly collapsed!At the same time, 36 attribute-less Dao meridians appeared.In just an instant, half of it exploded.All of the energy was absorbed into the bodies of the Silver Moon martial masters. Apart from director Zhao and a few others at the 7th level of the sun Moon realm, everyone else received a large amount of energy and the power of DAOs.Not only that, but at this moment, Li Hao forcefully opened the great Dao universe and stuffed the old turtle, Hong Mu, and the others into it. He chuckled and said,""Don't run around, I'll find you!"Li Hao's aura instantly fell from the Dao integration stage to the sun and moon stage.Nine layers of Sun Moon, eight layers of Sun Moon, seven layers of Sun Moon ...At the same time, the Black Panther also let out a shrill roar.As the devouring power burst forth, the two massive heaven's will exploded apart, causing a boundless amount of energy to sweep through the heavens and earth, causing Da Huang to explode into pieces!At this moment, Zheng Yu knew what he was doing.He only looked at Li Hao in a daze.On the other side, Li Hao's smile was as bright as a flower."This world ... This great Dao is not stable! I am the upper limit of the world, do you understand? When I fall, the world will shrink, do you understand? Zheng Yu ... You actually dared to bring so many saints to hunt me down. Who gave you the guts?"Boom! Boom! Boom!The heavens fell and the earth cracked! At this moment, even the heavens seemed to be screaming.The four main cities rapidly devoured a large amount of energy. The energy of heaven and earth was depleted in an instant. A section of heaven's will crumbled, and the great wilderness exploded. In the divine Kingdom region, Lin Hongyu had also crushed a large amount of heaven's will, which scattered in the sky.An expert who had obtained the blessing of heaven's will had severely injured the Heaven's Will in an instant.The entire Silver Moon began to tremble violently!The energy instantly weakened by a large margin.The heaven and earth that could originally accommodate a Sage suddenly began to produce a huge compression force. In order to protect themselves and stabilize the heaven and earth, void cracks appeared one after another. It was extremely powerful!Zheng Yu's expression changed drastically!"Retreat to Hurricane city!"In the distance, Hurricane city rose up from the ground and flew straight into the sky. Zheng Yu led the Saints and fled toward Hurricane city in a frenzy!In an instant, countless thick cracks appeared in the air and slashed down.All Saints were cut by countless cracks."Ah!"A miserable scream rang out!It was endless!Li Hao, at the cost of cutting off his own Dao and dropping his realm, restored everything in the world to its previous state. The world could no longer accommodate the appearance of powerful experts.If he was too powerful, he would cause the heavens and earth to collapse. At this moment, the entire world was being compressed and collapsed. One mountain after another was breaking apart!A single spatial Rift was not powerful.However, when a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand appeared ...Even Saints and Heavenly Kings would be cut! Kachaa!BOOM! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ A Saint was sliced apart and exploded. The great Dao emerged and in an instant, even the great Dao was cut into pieces by the space. Hurricane city was still flying up into the sky against the pressure.He would be fine once he returned to the ancient city!"Hurry!" Zheng Yu's clone roared.Boom! Boom! Boom!One after another, the Saints screamed and exploded. The energy from the explosions stabilized the world, but it was soon devoured by Li Hao. The four main cities approached.It seemed as if Zheng Yu was about to charge into the four great ancient cities with his men ... But very quickly, the four great ancient cities fled once again. They had received Li Hao's order to stay far away from this place.Spatial rifts were not targeted at the weak.As long as it didn't exceed the world's upper limit, it wouldn't be a problem.However, the stronger one was, the more targeted they would be!At this moment, in the distance, Ying Hongyue and the other two's expressions also changed drastically. The fleeing Queen's expression also changed drastically!

Chapter 2217 Who's More Ruthless Than Who (3)_5
These were All Saints.And at this moment, the world did not allow Saints to exist.……In the sky.Li Hao's aura continued to decline, and his body was still cracking. As he watched the Saints being killed one after another, his smile became even more brilliant."Interesting? How interesting ... Why aren't you guys devouring energy to cultivate?"Li Hao shouted angrily,"What are you looking at?!" Are you all stupid? Hurry up, or else heaven and earth will devour all the energy and repair itself!"Everyone seemed to have woken up from a dream!All of them were extremely dazed, but they began to absorb energy crazily. There was too much energy at this moment!There were too many!Li Hao's voice also came from all directions.""All the cultivators of the new Dao in the world, cultivate together and devour the energy of heaven and earth!"Even if it was only for a moment, it was enough for them to devour some high-quality energy.Li Hao's aura was still declining.Very quickly, it only stabilized when the seventh stage of Sun Moon was about to fall.Not far away, Zheng Yu's clone roared repeatedly and shattered countless spatial cracks. After a while, he led seven or Eight Saints back to the ancient city, and the remaining Saints were all cut up and exploded!Even the great Dao had been cut off!The world was compressed!Even if it was just a small world, it wasn't something Saints could resist. Perhaps only those at the half-step sovereign realm could hope to resist the compression of the world. Otherwise, the Saints would have come out long ago!At this moment, Zheng Yu's main body was silently looking at Li Hao!The losses were extremely heavy!Of course, it wasn't just him, but also Li Hao himself.He had actually severed countless DAOs and crippled the great wilderness just to kill these Saints.This time, 10 Saints had died.As for the 10 that went out...Would they be able to survive?Perhaps ... All of them were gone! The current heaven and earth could only accommodate the seventh stage of the sun and moon.Damn it, bastard! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Li Hao's smile was extremely bright."Don't worry. So many people died this time. Everyone will become stronger very soon. The world will be stable, and soon, Saints will be able to fit in again!" Next time, even if I self-destruct, it probably won't be of much use ... Because the Heaven's Will really hates me this time. It feels that I've been tormenting it every time ... Next time, it probably won't give me a chance, not even the great Dao ... Just this once, don't be afraid, it's just a few Saints who died!"Did some of them die?Zheng Yu did not say a word.Many, many people died!A Saint!The Zheng family's Foundation was all here. This time, more than half of the Saints had died. There were less than 10 Saints left in Hurricane city, and there were still a few Heavenly Kings.However, this strength ... Compared to before, how could it be like this in such a short time? Furthermore, the Saints would not be able to leave in a short period of time.Li Hao had actually given up most of his strength.'Damn it!'This should be a period of rapid improvement for him, and he might even reach the second or third level of Dao integration.But now, Li Hao was at the seventh level of the sun Moon realm, the peak of immortal realm.Of course, although Li Hao's power of great DAOs had collapsed, the Silver Moon martial masters had taken advantage of it. He had given all the power of his great DAOs to others, and at this moment, those people were all improving rapidly.Tian Jian and the others were all heading towards the seventh level of the sun Moon realm.Black Panther, on the other hand, was extremely miserable. He looked at Li Hao resentfully ... He had thought that he would get a great bargain this time, but now he realized that Li Hao was a real dog who only cheated his own people!No wonder you asked me to do it!Because it was a demon, it had a strong Constitution. Coupled with the bloodline of the demon subduing envoy, it could still survive even if heaven's will was destroyed ... As for the others ... They would probably die.This is a trap!Feeling the broken Dao Meridian in his body and his extremely weak body, Black Panther felt miserable as drops of dog blood dripped from his body. He glanced at Li Hao, who was in great pain!You tricked me again!Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther's cry was filled with innocence, pity, and grievance.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked up at the sky and the moon.He laughed.Li daoheng, you've gone in ... You probably won't be able to come out for a while.Heaven and earth were still unable to accommodate Saints.He then looked at the motionless Hurricane city and Zheng Yu with a bright smile.""Stop looking! Based on the current situation ... It would take at most a month or so for it to recover to the extent where it could accommodate a Sage! It was only a temporary break, not a permanent damage! In fact, in essence, the world is still recovering. So many saints have died and so much energy has been devoured. It was only temporarily drained by the people of the world ... Very soon, it will naturally recover!"Zheng Yu looked at him coldly.He knew!However, even after so many saints had died, he was still angry and helpless.He said slowly,'one month ... Can you recover to Sage level again? Li Hao, next time, the world will only be more stable. You'll self-destruct your Dao and meridians. Can you recover to your current level in a month?"If he couldn 't, Li Hao would be finished.This was also a probing question.He wanted to know ... What gave Li Hao the confidence to do this?To be able to kill so many saints in a single day ... Even if Zheng Yu didn't lose his mind, he could still bear with it.Ying Hongyue was most likely still alive because the seal had not been broken. However, the remaining Saints ... Would most likely not be able to return.As for the Queen ... No one cared about her life or death.Not only that ... If there were also Saints in the other ruins who happened to be spying on something outside and didn't manage to escape in time ... They would most likely die!

Chapter 2218 Who's More Ruthless Than Who (3)_6
This could be considered Li Hao's first sweep!Zhang an and the others had all left and entered the seal. He did not know the other Saints. The Saints on his side were all waiting in the ancient city. The old turtle and the others had been stuffed into the great path universe by him.If there were still Saints in the outside world at this moment ... No matter which side they were from, they were not good people. If they died, then so be it!Li Hao's smile remained bright."I still have 28 attribute-less Dao meridians in a month, and I'm barely at the seventh stage of the sun Moon realm ... I'll be at the ninth stage of the sun Moon realm if I open eight more ... I'll only need to open about ten more Dao meridians if I enter the Dao integration realm again, which is only one Dao Meridian every three days ... Zheng Yu, why do you look down on me so much?" But how many saints did you have under you then? Take them all out and see if I can deal with them. Also, you've forgotten ... I still have a few Saints on my side! Do you think those insignificant people under your command can kill me?"Li Hao's smile became even more devilish and brilliant.""This is called safety. Otherwise, I'll be hunted down by dozens of Saints. You see, I'm the boss again in the world now! As long as I don't enter the ruins, which one of you can do anything to me? If I don't become an expert, I'll be your father and your big brother. Zheng Yu, are you not convinced?"Looking at this crazy guy, Zheng Yu's expression turned ugly. He instantly disappeared in Hurricane city.In an instant, it merged into the ground and disappeared!Bastard!This Li Hao harmed others without benefiting himself!He had opened more than 80 Dao meridians, but he didn't even blink and wasted more than half of them just to be the boss for another month!Of course ... To Zheng Yu, it was a heart-wrenching pain!Too many saints had died!Even if Saints could leave, he wouldn't dare to let them. If they did, Li Hao still had many saints.This time, it was impossible to form an overwhelming situation.If he really went out and met the other party, he might be crushed.In fact, it had been far more than a month.Unless heaven and earth could accommodate a Heavenly King.Otherwise, no one on Li Hao's side would be able to restrain him.At this moment, Qian Wuliang and the others all opened their eyes and looked at Li Hao with complicated expressions.At this moment, there were many seventh level Sun Moon cultivators.Director Zhao, Qian Wuliang, sky sword, blade Overlord, light sword ...These people had almost all entered the seventh level of Sun Moon.As for King Li, Empress Dowager shuiyun, King Dahuang, Jiang Li, director Wang ... These people were also at the seventh stage of the sun Moon tier. Some had not improved, some had remained the same, while others had improved slightly.Originally, Li Hao had been the only one to show off, but at this moment, many people were on the same level as him!"Lord Marquis!"Qian Wuliang felt complicated and called out to Li Hao.At this moment, her feelings were really too complicated. Everyone was the same.Who would do such a thing when it came to Li Hao's situation?Now, this group of people had reached the seventh level of the sun Moon tier, and so had Li Hao. He wasn't really invincible among the seventh level. Wasn't he afraid at all?He severed some of his own great DAOs and distributed the power of his great DAOs to everyone.This time ... Li Hao didn't gain anything at all. Instead, he made Silver Moon and the others stronger. As a result, Liu Yan and the others, who were cultivators of the five-element Dao Meridian, were actually close to the seventh stage of the sun Moon realm.It could be said that he had reached the heavens in a single step!So many saints had died. If there were enough opportunities, some powerful cultivators might be born on this day. It would even be normal for them to step into the mountains, seas, sun, and moon.Li Hao was poor, but a large group of people became rich!Li Hao, however, was calm. He chuckled and said,""What's there? He had only broken a few Dao meridians! It was very messy to begin with, re-cultivating was also a good thing! I didn't want to do this in the first place ... But Zheng Yu got carried away and led dozens of Saints to hunt me down. If I don't teach him a lesson, he'll think that I, Li Hao, am easy to bully!"Li Hao's smile became even more brilliant,"I had a lot of fun this time!" He didn't expect that he would be able to deal with so many sages in a single day. There should be more than 20 of them! Let's wait for Zhang an and the others to come out ... I hope they're not in a hurry, and we'll talk about it a month later. If they come out now ... They'll definitely be cut a few times ... However, it's not a big deal that the star River City is still here, unless someone is not in the ancient city. "The ancient city was now the biggest defensive barrier.He cut through space and avoided the ancient cities.Perhaps it was because the ancient city suppressed the world. To the world, the existence of the ancient city was the foundation.Without the ancient city, the Saints in the ruins would have been cut to death.Everyone was silent.Seeing the tense atmosphere, Li Hao smiled.""Everyone has improved, what's there to be unhappy about? As for the king of Dali ... I'm sorry. I originally thought that you might be able to enter the Dao integration stage by stealing the sun ... But you saw it. I've gone too far. You don't mind, do you?"What could the king of Dali say?He could only remain silent.The seventh stage of the sun Moon ... Everyone was now at the same stage. Li Hao himself was one of them!What can you say?However, it also meant that he didn't gain anything this time. Jiang Li, on the other hand, was stronger than before, but ... The loss still outweighed the gain!He had nothing to say! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Was Li Hao doing this on purpose, or did he really have no other choice ...? He could only ask himself.In any case, the Silver Moon Martial Master had profited greatly, Zheng Yu had suffered a great loss, and the divine Kingdom had suffered a great loss. It was hard to say whether Li Hao had profited or profited, but since even his enemies had suffered a loss, he had profited!

Chapter 2219 Who's More Ruthless Than Who (3)_7
What a good method!Empress Dowager shuiyun, the great desolate King, and the others also had complicated feelings.Li Hao ... Was really capable.He had strengthened Silvermoon and weakened his enemy. As for himself ... Perhaps he really would be able to reach the daomerge level very soon. At that time, his enemy would be the one to suffer a huge loss.Along the way, even unknown powerhouses and enemies were swept clean!If any Saints had secretly appeared in the Silver Moon land and wandered around, they might have already been killed.Because Li Hao had reached the Dao integration stage, everyone had forgotten or perhaps never considered that he would weaken the world again. In the end, he really did it!Everyone kept peeking at Li Hao.Recently, Li Hao seemed to be very easy to talk to, and his smile had always been very bright ... But the more he looked at him, the more disappointed he became!At this moment, Li Hao stroked the Black Panther and comforted it,""It's fine, it's fine. Isn't it just a loss of a little heaven's will and chaos will? Didn't he just fail to reach the Dao integration stage? It's just a fake heaven and earth ... When we capture Silvermoon, I'll give you the real master of heaven and earth ...""Woof woof?"The Black Panther cried out resentfully. I don't believe anything you say!This time, he was really excited!In the end, he didn't get anything, but he was seriously injured!Li Hao chuckled and glanced at the crowd.""Alright, everyone disperse and do what you need to do! I'll have to find a turtle to protect them later. It was an emergency, and I don't know where I threw them! Don't lose them, or I'll lose two sages!"He had thrown the Redwood and the old turtle into the Dao universe at the last moment and opened a passage randomly. Who knew if they would get lost?"Almost everyone has stepped into the seventh level of the sun Moon realm. This is a rare opportunity. If you cultivate more, the ninth level of the sun Moon realm won't be difficult!""I've pulled the gap between us even time and time again, hoping that everyone can go further with me!"Li Hao looked at the sky and smiled happily.""The road ahead is long. It's better to see the sea of stars together than to be alone! "The Silver Moon martial masters all have their own unique characteristics. In order to catch up to me, they gave up too many things. Don't be in such a hurry to catch up, find what belongs to you! After a month, heaven and earth will probably recover to the level where it can accommodate Saints again. There's no need to worry. They don't dare to come out easily because they have fewer Saints. When they can accommodate a Heavenly King one day ... I'll try again for them, and it might not necessarily fail!" Then, he waved his hand to the ground and shouted,""Senior Zheng Yu, keep an eye on your Heavenly Kings. There shouldn't be many Heavenly Kings. Don't lose them unintentionally. It'll be troublesome to deal with venerable sovereigns!"Then, he laughed and left with everyone.After a long time, Hurricane city emerged from the ground.Zheng Yu frowned and looked at the sky.Li Hao ... That bastard.However, did this fellow cripple his own combat power to really deal with the Saints under me, or was it to ... Deal with others? Previously, he had been heading straight for the world barrier, and then he had self-detonated his great Dao.Could it be ... To force some people to leave this world?Void Dao universe?In his heart, he already had some guesses.……At the same time.In the universe of the great path, a bright moon shone brightly.The sword-carrying man tried to tear apart the great Dao universe ... A moment later, he chuckled.""How ruthless!"The moon goddess's voice came,"trouble!" Now that I'm out, the world is being cut apart. Also, my true body ... Seems to be greatly affected ..."Li Hao was really a bastard!The things he did were inhumane.Harming others without benefiting oneself!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Now, if they went out rashly, the world would cut them apart. Even if they could survive, they would make a big noise and be noticed by everyone."I'll stay here for a while. "The sword-carrying man shook his head and chuckled. Li Hao was getting more and more interesting.……At the same time, Li Hao hummed a little tune. At this moment, the world finally quieted down.Who asked you to be so arrogant!Although his strength had declined, he really didn't feel any heartache.Just as he said, the paths he had opened before were too messy and chaotic because there was no road ahead. He had to open them himself every time, and it was very chaotic. This time, he was giving himself a chance to sort things out.At the same time, he would also remove all the cancer in the world.However, at this moment, he couldn't help but look at the end of the North. The God of beginner martial in the North didn't seem to be moving. Had he gone back to hide long ago, or ... Did the space cutting not affect him much?The former was easy to deal with, but if it was the latter, that guy's physical body was too terrifying!
