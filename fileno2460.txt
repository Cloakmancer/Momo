If this went on, a prolonged battle would be extremely disadvantageous to their side.Lin Hongyu seemed to be losing her half-step sovereign power soon. As for li daoheng, if he really swallowed the river of chaos and Hong Yitang, Hong Yitang might not be able to fight back. He couldn't replace the real with the fake like the Queen. Even if it was his clone, it would be difficult.The difference in strength.Therefore, he had to break the situation.If not for this cat, Heaven's Fate might have been able to deal with Zheng Yu alone. However, with this cat, Heaven's Fate might be killed if it continued to defend.He still had to wait for all 180 stars to be ignited!The last star, which was his own star of time, had not been ignited by Li Hao. It was not that he could not, but that he ... Did not want to.That was because the real time star did not appear this time.The other party didn't even appear after such a huge commotion.The fusion of the DAOs of illusion and reality, the chaos lightning tribulation, and Li Hao's transformation into heaven's will ... The other party had not appeared.As for Li Hao, he had originally wanted to capture the real time star and make it the core of his great Dao ... But now, it was impossible to achieve.In this way, even if he condensed all 180 stars and barely reached the seventh level of the Dao integration realm, he would only be a half-step sovereign. He would be able to fight against them but would not have any advantages.This was slightly different from Li Hao's expectations.But at this point, Li Hao was powerless.No matter what, he had to advance first.In fact, there was still a way to draw out the time star, and that was to wait!He was waiting for li daoheng to merge with Hong Yitang by force!Once the true illusory great Dao merged, the star would inevitably appear. As for whether it would be captured by Li Hao or li daoheng, it was unknown.However, if that really happened, Hong Yitang would be finished.Li Hao took a deep breath. Endless energy from the entire world gathered, and a long river appeared. Time and Stars flickered above his head, and rays of light illuminated the world. The entire world seemed to have come to a standstill!Li Hao took a step forward. The star flickered and merged into his forehead!The light of the stars shone through the heavens and earth!Zheng Yu slashed again and again, sending Heaven's Fate flying backward. His body was covered in blood, and his aura had clearly declined by a large margin. To him, only defending and not attacking was an extremely huge challenge.He had never felt this aggrieved before!He tried to fight back several times, but as soon as he did, the cat would scratch him. This made Heaven's Fate so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood!He had no choice!He could only take a beating.At this moment, Li Hao heaved a long sigh.""Melt!"The stars in the sky gathered one by one! One, two, three ...Those stars were a combination of heaven's will, mental energy, sword will, force, and Dao meridians, so they were much stronger than pure Dao meridians. Even with 180 Dao meridians, he had only barely reached level five of the Dao integration realm.But now, after fusing with these, Li Hao's aura began to grow stronger at a visible rate!One star after another instantly entered Li Hao's Chrono star, and the entire Chrono star became even more resplendent. Zheng Yu's eyes flickered, and he once again slashed the celestial pole and headed straight for Li Hao! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ From the looks of it, even if Li Hao failed to capture the space-time star, he would at least reach the seventh level of Dao integration and become a half-Emperor if he succeeded.Even though he had just stepped into it and was inferior to him, if the other party were to step into it, there would be many more variables.Of course, devouring Li Hao after he became a half-Emperor would be more effective, but it would also increase the danger.Zheng Yu shuttled through the void at an extremely fast speed.His strength was also beyond imagination. The celestial pole couldn't stop him at all. The key was that they were bound and couldn't let go at all.Li Hao, however, ignored him.In just an instant, the spacetime star and Li Hao disappeared together. Zheng Yu's saber attack missed. His expression changed slightly as he turned around and slashed the saber toward the ground. The ground below instantly split open!Zheng Yu didn't say anything. At this moment, he was heading straight for the central continent.He raised his saber and was about to slash the heavens and earth!Li Hao was the Heaven's Will. He dodged very quickly, but as long as the humans in this world were exterminated, the Heaven's Will would suffer a great loss. Not only that, but Hong Yitang would also be severely injured!Both of them were deeply connected to Silver Moon! Li Hao had appeared!Zheng Yu stood in front of him and smiled.""You originally wanted to leave Silver Moon, but from the looks of it now, you can 't. These people have already become your constraints. Li Hao, you're quite daring, but it's a pity ... Fate still has you tied to Silver Moon!"If Li Hao hadn't turned into heaven's will, he could have ignored it. It was Hong Yitang who was injured, not him.However, at this moment, he could not.In reality, Li Hao did not mind it that much. Even if it had nothing to do with him, it involved Hong Yitang. The other party wanted to destroy Silver Moon, so he would still take action if it was necessary.But at this moment, Li Hao was a little disappointed.""It seems that even though you're a little smarter than I thought, you still haven't escaped from the treacherous path!"At that moment, the world was lit up!The whole world was enveloped by a long river. Li Hao's aura instantly soared. He had finally lit up his last star, and his aura instantly soared. Vaguely, the might of a half-Emperor emerged!Or rather, he had reached the seventh level of Dao integration.The 180 stars were comparable to a seventh-level Dao integration cultivator who cultivated the Dao of illusion and reality.At this moment, Li Hao finally had the strength to resist a pseudo-Emperor.However, Li Hao was not in a hurry to attack. Instead, he looked into the distance. Lin Hongyu had been sent flying by li daoheng's sword. He saw that li daoheng had captured the river of chaos and it was struggling violently!

At this moment, another star seemed to have appeared in the sky. The real time star seemed to have appeared, but it just looked at it from a distance and didn't dare to come over, or maybe it didn't think it was strange enough!"What's your relationship with li daoheng?"Li Hao suddenly asked while looking over.Zheng Yu didn't say anything. He strode toward Li Hao and slashed!Heaven and earth shattered!Li Hao raised his long sword and slashed. At this moment, a cat appeared on Zheng Yu's body and swiped at Li Hao with its claws!Heaven's Fate was somewhat anxious. Li Hao's retaliation would also lead to such an outcome.Li Hao's advancement didn't seem to have much of an effect!"You won't say?""Are you the same person?"Li Hao mumbled,"if that's the case, it's terrifying. What have you been studying all these years? Are you playing chess with yourself?"Zheng Yu waved his saber and broke the heaven and earth. He chuckled.""You're thinking too much!"BOOM!The blade and the cat attacked at the same time. They were both peak pseudo-emperors, and at this moment, Heaven's Fate also arrived. However, it was of little use. He was also afraid, so he could only take it head-on!Li Hao's attack caused the cat to retaliate even more strongly!The cat had become the key to restricting Li Hao and Heaven's Fate. Heaven's Fate was still the key. Li Hao didn't care, but the two of them were uncomfortable with this situation.Bang! Bang!Even though he had just advanced to the half-step sovereign realm, Li Hao was still heavily injured in an instant. A single attack caused Li Hao's head to bleed and a knife wound to appear on his body. Heaven's Fate was even worse. The cat scratched him, but he couldn't do anything, so his face was bloody!At this moment, Zheng Yu was able to suppress heaven and earth as he chuckled.""It seems like ... I won a small battle!"As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Li Hao again!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly extended his hand, and the power of time filled the world. He pointed at the cat's paw that had suddenly stretched out. The river of time quickly spread upward, and the cat suddenly stopped. The next moment, time started flowing!The cat Shadow, which originally only had some eight meridians in its mouth and was unable to swallow them, had swallowed half of the blood Dragon in an instant!Li Hao, on the other hand, instantly became much older!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be dying, but he still smiled. Zheng Yu's breathing stagnated as he looked at the cat. The cat in front of him seemed to have just swallowed half of his bloodline in one go after a long time.If he swallowed it completely again, the cat would no longer be his protection!"Not bad ... But, can you do it again? A fake is a fake after all. This is not the real time and star!"Zheng Yu regained his composure and looked at Li Hao. Without saying anything, he attacked again, slashing out with his saber!Li Hao's entire body was enveloped. The celestial pole attacked again. At this moment, the long saber changed direction, and the sky and earth collapsed with a slash. The celestial pole instantly fell into the shattered Void.Li Hao took a few steps back and broke space.,m He looked at the cat, then at Zheng Yu, and finally smiled.""Eight meridians as one?" Suddenly, in the distance, the seven giant cities trembled! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ The seven main cities began to tremble at this moment. Zheng Yu turned around and took a look, then said calmly,""You want to take eight cities and transform them into eight meridians? In that case, the one from the red moon will really come out!""Is that something I should be considering?"Li Hao chuckled. Yes, he was going to use the eight main cities to form eight branches and lure the cat away!Zheng Yu smiled and didn't mind.At this moment, among the eight main cities, Hurricane city suddenly trembled violently. The Saint who was suppressing Hurricane city suddenly vomited blood. This main city was currently under li Fuhai's control.However, this powerful Saint kept spitting out blood. Even if he transformed into his true form, it would be difficult to suppress him!Hurricane city, which was about to turn into an eight Meridian city, instantly came to a halt.The entire city seemed to have gone out of control.Not only this city, not far away, Dao Jian and the others who were guarding boundless city suddenly changed their expressions. At this moment, Dao Jian's expression suddenly changed. He looked into the distance and murmured,""Am I really your clone?"He seemed to have had the same suspicions. Or rather, ever since he had reached the Dao integration stage, everyone had had the same suspicions.The Dao sword had advanced to the Dao integration stage too quickly.It was so fast that everyone felt that ... There was something wrong with this person.A person that everyone thought was problematic was actually not in line with the layout style of the strong. However, in this way, doing the opposite seemed to be able to achieve success.There was someone beside Dao Jian.Not only was Dao Jian in charge of boundless city, director Zhao and the old turtle were also in charge. At this moment, hearing Dao Jian's voice, feeling the change in his aura, and the shaking of the entire boundless city, the two of them were shocked!The Taoist sword was the object of their defense.However, at this moment, it seemed that something had really happened to the other party, which made them feel a little uneasy.The eight main cities were divided into eight branches, and losing two main cities ... They would not be of much use.Director Zhao and the old turtle didn't say anything and charged at the Dao sword. One of them used the eight direction seal and the other turned into a turtle shell to suppress the heavens and earth. They wanted to suppress the Dao sword!……Li Hao took a look.Taoist sword?Was this person, who was so obvious that he was practically a chess piece on the surface, really Zheng Yu's clone?If not ... Then at this moment, the aura of the Taoist sword suddenly soared, and the boundless city seemed to be fluctuating with it. What was this?He saw that the Taoist sword seemed to be adapting to the power that had just grown, and it didn't take the initiative to fight back. It was just a little confused. Looking at the two experts pressing down, it seemed that it had no intention to fight back, nor was it in the mood to fight back.He just silently waited for the attack to arrive!

Li Hao frowned slightly. A moment later, he shouted in a low voice,""Stop!"In the distance, the two old turtles were stunned. They looked at Li Hao in confusion, only to find that Li Hao had stopped them.However, Zheng Yu didn't care about this. He slashed at Li Hao again!Li Hao kept retreating. He was simply no match for him. If he hadn't just advanced, he would have been struck to death.As for Heaven's Fate, he was covered in blood. He had just crawled out of the void when he was struck by the saber again. He cursed in anger and was smashed into the void abyss again.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly looked in that direction. He looked at boundless city, and his expression changed slightly. He then looked at Zheng Yu, who smiled."What are you thinking about?"Li Hao's expression changed. He quickly fled, heading straight for boundless city!Zheng Yu also appeared instantly and slashed out with his saber!"What are you running for?"BOOM!The two of them fought fiercely in the void. Li Hao's expression changed again and again. Even though he was no match for his opponent, he was still thinking quickly. Dao sword ... Zheng Yu didn't seem to be afraid of Dao sword being killed, or rather, it didn't affect him much even if he was killed.Because it was just a clone?The aura of the Dao sword suddenly rose ... Was it controlled by Zheng Yu?One thought after another kept appearing in his mind.Dao sword was a genius of this era. Before Li Hao appeared, he had always been a genius, an extremely talented swordsman ... Swordsman?A pure superhuman, which meant that they were born to be the Pathfinders!At this moment, Li Hao's expression changed. He suddenly thought of something and roared,""What's the heavenly Dao ruler? Whose weapon is it?"The heavenly Dao ruler!It was a not-so-powerful divine weapon. A long time ago, it was the fuse that led to the war between the three major organizations and the night patrollers. Later, it was embraced by Taoist swords. Li Hao had seen it once. It was not a very powerful weapon.Therefore, he didn't care anymore.This weapon was very compatible with the Dao sword. When it was in the hands of the night patrolman, it was taken away by the Dao sword. Or rather, the heavenly Dao ruler had chosen the Dao sword of its own accord. Although it was not considered powerful, it was very spiritual.This weapon was nothing like the Saint weapons, Heavenly King weapons, and even monarch weapons that appeared later on. It was only an early treasure, and gradually, almost everyone forgot about its existence.At this moment, when Li Hao shouted, everyone was a little confused.The heavenly Dao ruler ... He didn't seem to be familiar with it.Did the heavenly Dao ruler exist in neo martial?"Dao sword, take out the heavenly Dao ruler!" Li Hao roared again.In the distance, the sword seemed to be a little confused. Or rather, he had been confused and at a loss since the beginning. He also felt that he ... Was most likely Zheng Yu's clone.In an instant, his aura had skyrocketed and he had suddenly stepped from the first stage of Dao integration to the second stage. In the blink of an eye, he had stepped into the third stage of Dao integration. Such speed was unimaginable!It was too fast!It was so fast that it was unbelievable. It just so happened that boundless city was also shaking, which perfectly matched the signs of Zheng Yu's clone.At this moment, hearing Li Hao's voice, Dao Jian took out the heavenly Dao ruler, which he rarely used.It was a ruler, crystal clear and very beautiful.This item had the function of measuring talent and could distinguish a human's cultivation talent.At this moment, except for Zheng Yu and Li Hao, everyone else looked at the ruler.Heaven's Fate also took a look, but he was not familiar with it. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It seemed to be just an ordinary weapon.The others also took a look at it, but they didn't recognize it. In the new martial era, there were too many weapons left behind. Who knew who had left this behind? it wasn't too powerful anyway.In heaven battling city, the ninth Division commander also glanced over.He had heard of the heavenly Dao ruler, but it wasn't a powerful weapon. If Li Hao and the others didn't care, he wouldn't care either.At this moment, the ruler ... Did not look familiar.However, in the next moment, he took a few more glances and was a little confused. He frowned slightly and took a few more glances. His expression changed slightly."The heavenly Dao ruler ... The heavenly Dao ruler ... The husband Dao sword? The headmaster of the Academy has to restrain himself and his desires ..."His expression changed instantly as some of his childhood memories surfaced in his mind. His elder brother loved to toy with everyone when he was young. Later, the parents would beat up their own children. However, the ninth teacher vaguely remembered one thing. Later on, during a class in the Li family's private school, their teacher had given his elder brother a sword.The sword that wasn't too powerful was called the husband's path sword.The teacher said that this was a form of self-restraint and self-control used by master Gu. Only by taking good care of oneself could one go further. His elder brother was very talented, but he was unparalleled in his schemes at a young age. The Li family didn't pay much attention to him, but the teacher seemed to have noticed something.He had given his opponent a sword, which was also the sword li daoheng had used when he was weak!A thought suddenly appeared in the ninth Division commander's mind. He looked at the Taoist sword in the distance in disbelief."Is that ... The husband Dao sword?""Why is it in your hands?"He was a little shocked as he shouted,""Impossible! This sword ... It disappeared a long time ago. How could it be here?""Whose sword is that?" Li Hao shouted angrily.Li daoheng's sword!""The husband Dao sword was given to li daoheng by our teacher!" The ninth Division commander shouted. It was given to him many years ago to abide by his own Dao and restrain himself. It was teacher's admonishment to him ..."The next moment, he shouted again,"our teacher left many years ago. It is said that our teacher is most likely the blood Emperor. I don't know if it is true or not. Back then, the blood Emperor stayed in the Silver Moon for a period of time. He was on good terms with our ancestor, the Supreme Sword. So, some people say that our teacher is the incarnation of the blood Emperor ... Could it be that the Supreme Sword ancestor never mentioned it?"At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have realized something. He suddenly slashed out with his sword. The burst of power was so strong that Zheng Yu was a little dazzled!Li Hao turned around and ran toward the Taoist sword!"Li Hao, why are you running?" Zheng Yu raised his eyebrows."The things you care about are always different from others!"Li Hao ignored him. He looked into the distance as he fled. Li daoheng was capturing the chaos great Dao and seemed to be devouring it. He had even taken control of and devoured some of the rivers!It was extremely terrifying!A thought appeared in Li Hao's mind. Wrong, he was wrong.Someone had taken over The Magpie's Nest!p Damn it!Zheng Yu ... Zheng Yu had taken over the other party's territory. The Li daoheng in their judgment was incomparably powerful and unparalleled in his schemes. Li daoheng, who had grasped Phantom path, had all the characteristics of the other party.But ... What if the Li daoheng who had grasped Phantom Dao was Zheng Yu?The man with the sword on his back ... Was the real li daoheng. However, he was the real li daoheng's previous life. The real li daoheng might have reincarnated and, like the guy from Fengyun Pavilion, chose to reincarnate and integrate into this era.Damn it!At this moment, countless thoughts emerged. Perhaps the man with the sword was li daoheng, but later, he was taken over by someone else. All of li daoheng's will was thrown into the new era. Dao sword?Therefore, whether it was devouring the chaos great Dao or himself ... It was all one person!Zheng Yu?Was that even possible?Li Hao shuddered and turned to look at Zheng Yu, who was still indifferent.""Li Hao, you can't escape!"Li Hao gritted his teeth."You ... Aren't in a hurry to kill me!" He said.He didn't seem to be in such a hurry.Even if li daoheng was devouring the river of chaos and seemed to be a step faster and more relaxed than him.As for the Dao sword, its aura suddenly rose and its strength increased. Was it really related to this guy?Or was it because ... Too much of the sword-carrying man's power had leaked out, and he had been fused with li daoheng, who wielded Phantom path, causing his power to further leak out?At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have understood!But it seemed too late!If it was really as he had guessed ... Was this Zheng Yu still a strong person who looked strong but was only shrewd and not considered unparalleled?Zheng Yu smiled and said,'I'm just a burden. Can't I just hold everyone back? The more you do, the more mistakes you'll make. The more you rush, the more mistakes you'll make, so ... Don't rush!"He was really not in a hurry!At the very least, Li Hao, Heaven's Fate, second cat, Blood Blade ... All of them had been held back by him, right?I'm a burden to begin with!

Chapter 2463 Beyond The Silver Moon (1)
Li daoheng had reincarnated?At this moment, Li Hao also fell into confusion. The man with the sword was li daoheng's sword Dao clone, or rather, the strength of his previous life, while Li Hao himself had chosen to reincarnate and merge with it at a certain stage?However, his sword Dao clone was seized by Zheng Yu?Then ... Li daoheng's reincarnation didn't take any precautions?Also, the so-called integration of the Fengyun Pavilion had a lot of drawbacks. There were still many memories, but some were missing. It was impossible to reincarnate perfectly in the Silver Moon world. Dao Jian seemed to have no memories. How did he do it?All sorts of thoughts appeared in his mind, but at this moment, it seemed useless to care about these things.Li Hao could still hold on for a while, but Hong Yitang couldn't hold on much longer. Whether the man with the sword was li daoheng or Zheng Yu's clone, they were both devouring the river of chaos.If this continued, the river of chaos would be devoured.Li haoning's plan of eight cities and eight meridians failed because of these changes. He was unable to form new eight meridians and let the cat beside Zheng Yu leave.It didn't matter who the two were.More importantly, even if Li Hao had succeeded in star integration, he had only just entered the half-step sovereign realm. One half-step sovereign obviously couldn't fight so many half-step sovereigns. The key was that the real time star had yet to appear.As a result, Li Hao wasn't able to capture it, and his battle prowess didn't increase as much as he had imagined. It didn't directly reach the level where he could match Zheng Yu and the others."Only by solving the problem of the eight meridians and letting that cat leave can the Heaven's Fate unleash its true strength. Only then can it help me stop Zheng Yu and even kill him ... Only then can I go and save senior uncle Hong ..."The power of time that he had been nurturing had almost been exhausted just now. That cat had swallowed half of his eight meridians.The remaining half, the tiny bit of time power, was not enough to speed up its devouring.Moreover, if the master of the void Dao star was Zheng Yu, this guy could enter the venerable sovereign realm at any time, but he had not. What was he trying to do? would he be in danger after entering the venerable sovereign realm?The Great Tribulation of venerable sovereigns?Or was he worried about something else?Li Hao glanced at Zheng Yu again out of the corner of his eye. Zheng Yu was reluctant to step into the venerable sovereign level, so he must still be afraid. As for the Dao universe, even if he stepped into the venerable sovereign level, it was not impossible to devour it.There was no need to keep waiting!There must be something wrong with this. This person ... Did not dare to enter the venerable sovereign realm rashly!The Taoist sword in front of him was still confused.Zheng Yu, who was behind him, was in no hurry to give chase. Even further behind, Heaven's Fate was still struggling. He wanted to attack several times, but was blocked by the cat.If this continued ... They would all be unlucky."I'm the will of the heavens!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, Li Hao didn't think too much. He glanced to the other side. Lin Hongyu's deathly aura was exuberant and was about to be completely destroyed. Hong Yitang struggled violently, but he couldn't do anything to a half-step sovereign.I'm the will of the heavens ... Heaven's will, eight meridians!The convergence of the eight branches was actually the power of heaven and earth, which was the power of the entire Silvermoon world. The eight divine weapons had turned into eight main cities. In fact, the cat in the saber had only recovered by devouring the power of heaven's will and the power of the Silvermoon.A new world and a new heaven's will were the best tonics for cats.Eight meridians was just a manifestation of the power of heaven and earth.At this moment, the cat seemed to be about to open its eyes.However, it was still a little short. After swallowing Ying Hongyue last time and half of Zheng Yu's eight meridians power this time, this cat was on the verge of recovery. And I ... Happened to be the incarnation of heaven's will.The Heaven's Will represented the will of the entire Silver Moon.He no longer thought about whether li daoheng had left behind any backup plans. He didn't even think about whether li daoheng was alive or dead. All of this ... Wasn't important.If the cat was resurrected and awakened, would it continue to protect Zheng Yu?It shouldn't be!There were too many changes today. Li Hao was like a lone boat in the ocean, rising and turning again and again, but he still found it difficult to protect himself.Since that was the case ... Then no one should think of having an easy time.No matter how you plan, no matter how you scheme, at this point, I will flip the chessboard and destroy everyone's plan!The river of time once again surrounded his body.Li Hao stopped running. He turned around and pointed at the cat. Seeing this, Zheng Yu laughed."You don't have enough time power!"He could sense that Li Hao's power of time was running low.It was not enough for the cat to devour the remaining eight meridians power again, so it was useless.The next moment, he hit the cat's paw with his finger. The cat was also protecting its food, not giving Li Hao a chance to hurt Zheng Yu. Zheng Yu smiled brightly and slashed at Li Hao.At this moment, he was almost invincible!Unless Red Moon sovereign could break the seal, but obviously, at this moment, that person could not break the seal. In the entire Silver Moon, this sovereign was the most miserable. From the beginning to the end, he was just a meal on everyone's plate.It was difficult for the seven main cities to break the seal now.Li Hao's finger was instantly shattered. The power of time was exhausted, but it had little effect on the cat. The long saber was also about to fall toward Li Hao. Heaven's Fate, who was behind him, was furious. He felt that he had made a mistake this time.He had been played by a few juniors!Just as he was about to stop them, Li Hao sighed."The two of you are playing too high-end and too complicated. You have me in you, and I have you in me. I can't tell you apart. Are you Zheng Yu or li daoheng, and is that person beside you li daoheng or Zheng Yu ... I can't tell!"

Chapter 2464 Beyond The Silver Moon (3)
"Or rather, from the beginning to the end, you were one person or two people ... I can't even tell!"Zheng Yu smiled and was about to say something.It was too boring and too lonely.He actually wanted to say something after a hundred thousand years of silence.But at this moment, heaven and earth trembled. Li Hao sighed."Forget it. I don't care what's going on with you guys ... Senior Empyrean terminus, can you really kill this person without this cat?""Without second cat to block me, I'll beat the sh * t out of him!"Heaven's Fate was furious. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Then we'll wait and see!"At this moment, Li Hao laughed, and his figure suddenly became extremely illusionary. It was only at this moment that Li Hao seemed to have truly become the will of heaven.Heaven's will was invisible!The long saber missed!The power of the eight meridians suddenly appeared on Li Hao's body, but it was illusory. This was the power of the eight meridians formed by the will of the world. He stepped forward and gently stroked the cat's head.The cat, at this moment, did not fight back. It just closed its eyes, as if it was trying to open them.His nose twitched a little, as if he had smelled something.Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly.Eight meridians?Li Hao thought of something and laughed at himself."That day, I ate the red moon as food. Today ... I, Li Hao, will also be food. Zheng Yu, as long as the will of the heavens is not destroyed, I will return! If you don't die ... We'll see!"In an instant, Li Hao disappeared into the cat's mouth like a wisp of smoke!Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly!At that moment, the cat, which was originally biting on the power of the eight meridians, suddenly let go as if it had eaten something more delicious and sweet. In an instant, it broke away from Zheng Yu.Not only that, the cat's eye trembled. This time, it seemed like it was about to open its eyes.In Zheng Yu's hand, the originally submissive blood saber suddenly trembled violently and exploded with a bright saber intent. With a loud bang, the powerful saber intent pierced Zheng Yu's palm and instantly separated from it, returning to second cat's side.The celestial pole fell!He looked at Zheng Yu and then at the cat. At this moment, second cat was motionless, as if it was absorbing and digesting something. The whole world was shaking violently. In the cat's belly, there was a looming figure, as if there was a person!Li Hao ... Transformed into heaven's will, fed himself to the cat!Whether it was the power of the eight meridians or anything else, it was a part of the Silver Moon to begin with. At this moment, Li Hao represented the entire Silver Moon and directly sent it into the cat's mouth. To the cat, this was even more fragrant than the power of the eight meridians.Heaven's Fate's expression changed. Li Hao, he fed the cat. This ... This was Emperor Cang's projection. There was nothing that Emperor Cang could not swallow and digest. He could even swallow the universe. Although er Mao was not Emperor Cang's actual body, he might be completely digested if he really swallowed the Silver Moon's will! Once Li Hao was completely digested, he would be dead even if he turned into heaven's will.He suddenly looked at Zheng Yu, who was frowning as well. He looked at second cat, Heaven's Fate, and Li Hao, who seemed to be smiling and mocking, in the cat's belly."Why do you have to do this?" his eyes were slightly dark.The whole world seemed to be shaking. At this moment, Heaven's Fate gritted his teeth."You little brat, grandson ... You dare to tease me? even in the new martial era, few people dare to tease me like this!"In an instant, the blood energy in his body exploded. It was extremely powerful, far more powerful than before."Die!"The punch was like the falling of the universe. The sky collapsed and the earth cracked. A domain was formed around it. The whole world seemed to be covered. At this moment, the cat did not move.Even though Zheng Yu still had half of the power of the eight meridians left, the cat no longer cared!Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly, and he also threw a punch!He was a top-notch half-Emperor, while Tian Ji was a clone of a venerable sovereign. By right, the clone was inferior to him. For example, the clone of Red Moon venerable sovereign was actually inferior to them in strength.Before this, Heaven's Fate had only defended and not attacked, so they couldn't tell if the attack was strong or not.But now, everyone knew. They couldn't care about other places, the Taoist sword, or Lin Hongyu and the others. They all looked over.BOOM!It was a powerful punch that seemed to be able to break the entire Silver Moon!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the world. It was as if the world barrier had been torn apart. Zheng Yu's figure was like a cannonball. With a loud bang, he flew backward and smashed into the world barrier!In the sky, the world barrier seemed to be shattering!Zheng Yu's blood was flowing. He looked at his arm ... The fist had disappeared, and there was even a transparent hole in his chest.Below, the celestial pole's aura was extremely violent!At this moment, the new Martial Emperor finally revealed his true strength. He gritted his teeth and said,""You're so bold! You know that I don't care about you, you know that I'm a venerable sovereign, you know that the blood Emperor, the human King, and Emperor Cang care about you, you dare to play with us! "Do you know that even in new martial arts, whether it's your Zheng family or Li family ... Anyone, even the one from the Zhang family, is only below the top level!""Are we people you can use?"Heaven's Fate was furious. Step by step, he instantly stepped into the sky, and his aura became stronger and stronger.He had actually been played by a junior! He had relied on Li Hao and fed second cat to get the chance to display his strength. This was a great humiliation!"All these years, I only have one thought ... Whether it's you or li daoheng, it's up to you who becomes the venerable sovereign. It's fine as long as it doesn't affect me. When the Silver Moon breaks and I return to neo martial, you can explain it to the human King and the others!"

Chapter 2465 Beyond The Silver Moon (3)
"But you ... Why are you so insensible?"BOOM!A fist shot through the heavens and earth, shaking the world and even breaking the world barrier!"Do you think I'm that useless venerable sovereign Hong Yue?""Even if I'm not one of the best, I'm still much stronger than that trash, Hong Yue!"After experiencing the four eras of beginner martial, origin martial, new martial, and silver Moon, this Prince Gou of the new martial era was not that weak. He just liked to hide when he encountered trouble. In the entire new martial era, he was only afraid of the human king and emperor Cang. He did not care much about the Zhang family's Supreme martial artists.After suffering such a great humiliation today, he was completely enraged and his ferocity was unleashed!BOOM!With another punch, the firmament was completely torn apart, and cracks even appeared on the wall of the world. With this punch, Zheng Yu's expression changed, and he quickly burst out with his peak half-step sovereign power!Bang Bang Bang!A series of sounds resounded through the entire world. His body exploded, and the celestial pole turned into countless phantoms. At this moment, only the shadows of countless fists appeared. Zheng Yu, who had been invincible just now, kept hitting the world barrier again and again, groaning continuously!Zheng Yu was also shocked!So strong?It's just a clone, how could it be!"You son of a B * tch, you haven't experienced many battles. Do you really think that all neo martial artists are trash like you? The venerable sovereigns of new martial arts, the venerable sovereigns who proved their Dao on their own ... Who would be weaker than you?""Even if it's a clone, it's still a clone of a venerable sovereign!""What scheme? Do we need to scheme?"Heaven's Fate hammered the world in anger!What scheme?We don't need it!  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ If we can kill him with one punch, then we will. Only people without strength would scheme.BOOM!The sound of an explosion rang out as Zheng Yu continued to resist and explode. At this moment, waves of powerful strength surged out continuously, but he was still suppressed by the other party!Without the cat as a protective talisman, Heaven's Fate's strength was beyond imagination.At this moment, everyone was stunned."Senior, Li Hao!" Someone shouted in shock.Li Hao had fed the cat with his own body. At this moment, it was almost digested. The whole world was shaking violently, which was a sign that the world couldn't bear the burden.Heaven's Fate was unreasonable. At this moment, he had no choice but to kill Zheng Yu first!How detestable! How hateful!As for Li Hao ... He could only wait for second cat to wake up. He might not even need to completely digest Li Hao before he woke up. Once he awakened, with second cat's personality, it would not continue to devour Li Hao. It was a kind cat.It was different from Emperor Cang. Even if Emperor Cang woke up, he might find the taste good and continue to eat. However, er Mao would not. At this moment, he could only bet that second cat would wake up before Li Hao died.As for him ...His only mission was to beat this son of a B * tch to death!A junior who had not experienced much actually dared to challenge an ancient existence?BOOM!There was another loud noise, and the world trembled. Zheng Yu's entire body was shattered by the punch, and he fell down. At this moment, li daoheng, who was still devouring the river of chaos, suddenly flashed and appeared in front of Zheng Yu.At that moment, Zheng Yu's eyes were filled with shock, not at li daoheng, but at the celestial pole.He looked at his broken body and muttered,""I'm only one step away from venerable sovereign ... And I'm not as good as you?"He was already at the peak of the half-Emperor realm, but in the end ... He was beaten to the point of near death by the celestial pole clone.Just as Heaven's Fate had said, in the face of strength, all schemes were useless.Of course, it was now.Previously, he had ermao to protect him, but the celestial pole didn't say so.At this moment, Zheng Yu laughed bitterly and turned to look at the celestial pole who was chasing after him again."It seems like ... There are benefits to being old!"At this moment, two of li daoheng's clones suddenly appeared.One of them was a man with a sword on his back, and the other was li daoheng, who had transformed into a star. Among them, the man who had transformed into a star instantly revealed his true appearance, which was exactly the same as Zheng Yu's usual self when he was chatting in Hurricane city!He was exactly the same as himself!Two Zheng Yu's appeared and walked together in an instant. A monstrous aura appeared, and Zheng Yu's injured body began to heal in an instant.Heaven's Fate didn't rush up immediately. He only took a look and sneered,""You have quite a few tricks! The void Dao universe seems to have always been under your control, and you even seized the real li daoheng's sword Dao body ..."Zheng Yu's aura continued to rise, and the sword-carrying man beside him was slightly stiff and didn't move.Zheng Yu looked at the celestial pole and sighed with emotion.""A little trick? Senior Empyrean terminus, in your eyes, what is a great technique? Li daoheng had put his spiritual will into heaven and earth and reincarnated. Was this considered a great technique? But what was the result? Didn't I still fail? I was one step behind and ended up benefiting myself. "His aura was getting stronger and stronger, and he was even starting to advance to the venerable sovereign level."Li daoheng did scheme quite a bit ... What's the result?"He laughed,'you know that I'm by your side, yet you still dare to make such a choice ... You're really bold! The Silver Moon world isn't perfect, and reincarnating here is suicide, isn't it?"He looked at Dao Jian, who was still at a loss. Zheng Yu smiled and said,""Senior, look. Now, be it li daoheng or Li Hao ... They're both crippled and finished ... The only one left here is me!"

In your eyes, this is also a small trick?He stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion. A long river of chaos appeared and started to tremble continuously. In the long river, a human face could be vaguely seen. It seemed to be in pain.Zheng Yu grabbed Changhe and smiled, no longer as shocked as he was earlier.""Senior, if I swallow this River, I can advance to the venerable sovereign realm! In senior's eyes, is this still a small trick?"His arm transformed into a giant dragon and reached into the river. A devouring power erupted and quickly absorbed the power of the river.In the long river, Hong Yitang revealed a pained expression.In front of a true peak half-Emperor, he was simply no match. Li Hao had said that one day li daoheng would devour him and he would replace him. At that time, he had thought it was a good idea, but if he really encountered him, he simply had no ability to fight back!Zheng Yu's aura was getting stronger and stronger!The shock he felt earlier also disappeared. He let out a breath."Senior, why don't you dare to come up?"At this moment, he was much more confident.Heaven's Fate ignored him and only turned to look at the cat in the air. At this moment, the cat's eyes were constantly trembling as if they were about to open. Li Hao had already disappeared without a trace, but heaven's will had probably not completely disappeared, or heaven and earth would have reacted.At the very least, there was no rain of blood, which meant that heaven's will was still there.Heaven's Fate ignored Zheng Yu. Instead, he glanced at the man with the sword and suddenly said,""Li daoheng, as the most outstanding descendant of the Li family, you've been toyed with by the Zheng family's kid?"Li daoheng was the most talented person in the Li family, second only to venerable the sword.He was so easily tricked by Zheng Yu?This sword Dao clone was very strong, but it didn't seem to have many memories and was very dull.He looked at the Taoist sword not far away. His strength had stopped increasing, and he was still at a loss.Zheng Yu also looked over and laughed.""It looks like his memories haven't awakened yet ... Senior, are you still counting on him to give me a lightning-like strike?"As soon as he finished speaking, without waiting for Heaven's Fate to make a move, he took the initiative to attack. He didn't aim at Heaven's Fate, but reached out his hand and grabbed. An incomparably huge palm directly grabbed towards the Dao sword in the boundless city! He had never been too sure about li daoheng's reincarnation.He only locked onto two people, Dao Jian and Hong Yitang. Yes, including Hong Yitang.Today, he used li daoheng's previous incarnation to swallow the river that Hong Yitang had transformed into. As a result, Dao Jian's aura skyrocketed. Obviously, Dao Jian was the real reincarnation of li daoheng. He had to take advantage of this moment to eliminate a scourge.In case this fellow really awakens and returns to his previous life, it would be a problem.The huge palm grabbed at the Dao sword!At this moment, in the boundless city, director Zhao and the old turtle's expressions changed. This attack was close to a venerable sovereign's attack. They had not even touched it, but they already felt their bodies crack. They were unable to block it at all. Although Dao Jian's strength had improved a lot, it seemed that he was still unable to block it!The celestial pole could have stopped him, but he didn 't.Zheng Yu saw this scene from the corner of his eye and was slightly moved. You won't stop me?The current Heaven's Fate might not be his match after he fused his two bodies.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ If the Dao sword recovered and merged with the man with the sword, it would be troublesome if the two of them joined forces. However, the celestial pole didn't stop them ... Even if the Dao sword recovered its memory, it couldn't do anything to him.The thought flashed through his mind.The giant palm had already fallen, not to kill the old turtle and the others, but to grab and crush the Dao sword.He had once doubted whether this Dao sword was li daoheng or not. However, after devouring the river, the sword intent of the man on the back of the sword had overflowed, and Dao Jian's strength had increased as a result. It was obvious that he had confirmed that this guy was li daoheng's reincarnation.Furthermore, the husband's Dao sword was also in his hands. It had fallen into his hands from the moment it appeared, and it had even taken the initiative to acknowledge him as its master. All of this proved everything.Li daoheng was also a big problem.If he didn't deal with this guy, he would become a disaster sooner or later!At this moment, in the distant heaven battling city, the 9th Division leader was extremely anxious!If li daoheng had reincarnated long ago, it meant that li daoheng was not necessarily a traitor, but his elder brother. At this moment, seeing that Dao Jian was about to be killed, he was extremely anxious, but he couldn't do anything to stop this palm!The only thing that could stop them was the celestial pole, but they just watched and didn't care.This made him both anxious and shocked. Why didn't the celestial pole stop him?If his elder brother wasn't a traitor and had taken back his previous incarnation, he could still fight Zheng Yu with him. Zheng Yu, who had merged his two bodies, was extremely strong, and his aura was infinitely close to that of a venerable sovereign.Heaven's Fate did not pay any attention to this. He had originally wanted to stop them.But at this moment, it stopped.Not far away, second cat's eyes trembled. At this moment, it seemed to have opened its eyes, and in its eyes ... A person appeared. It was Li Hao!At this moment, Li Hao's will was somewhat scattered.However, he knew that he was still alive.At the moment when he was about to be destroyed and completely swallowed, The Cat Came Back to life. It was as if he had been swallowed into the sea of consciousness of the cat, an extremely pure sea of consciousness.This cat ... Was like a newborn child, without too many distracting thoughts.The will that was as vast as the ocean was extremely pure. It seemed to be curious about everything. It really seemed like a very kind cat. The moment it opened its eyes, it stopped devouring.At this moment, Li Hao was also looking at the whole world through the cat's eyes!He looked at Zheng Yu, at the Taoist sword, at the celestial pole, and at the man with the sword on his back ...Through the cat's eyes, he seemed to see many things that he had never seen before.

These two people ... Had really calculated to the extreme.Was there a need to?Why?At this moment, Li Hao moved. No, the cat moved. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have merged with the cat. With a thought, Li Hao appeared in the sky above boundless city.A claw struck out!Crack!The void split open, and Zheng Yu's arm was instantly scratched. Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly as he looked at the cat."You're awake?"He looked at the sky and suddenly said,"Are you Li Hao or Emperor Cang's projection?""What do you think?" Li Hao said."You possessed the projection of Emperor Cang?""You ..." Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly."How dare you!"Possession!But Li Hao said,"wrong. I'm not possessing you. I'm just borrowing your body. Do you think I'm as shameless and bored as you? you're both using your clone and your body. Isn't it better to use your own power?""You want to stop me?"Zheng Yu's aura grew stronger and stronger. At this moment, the river in his hand trembled as he looked at Li Hao."It is too late to Stop Me Now! I'm about to become a saint Emperor ... Even if I don't kill li daoheng, all of you together won't be able to do anything to me!"Zheng Yu laughed."The new Dao universe has already appeared. The reality Dao universe, the void Dao universe, the Heaven's Will that you incarnated as, Emperor Cang's projection, senior Tian Ji's clone, li daoheng's previous incarnation, the red moon Emperor's main body, and the Silver Moon world ... As long as I absorb all of them, I think I will become the top existence even among the venerable sovereigns!""I've been waiting for this day for far too long!""Of course!" A smile appeared on Zheng Yu's face."Only now can we be considered to have completely unearthed all of Silver moon's potential!""I originally thought that my greatest enemy was li daoheng ... So I kept thinking about how to deal with him. I never thought that he would choose to reincarnate. This is something I didn't expect ... It's a good thing for me!"He laughed."Everyone says that li daoheng's schemes are unparalleled. In the end, this person is too arrogant. Does he really think that I can't find him just because he hid his sword way clone?"BOOM!A powerful aura once again pierced through heaven and earth, and a palm was aimed at Li Hao!Li Hao transformed into a cat and swiped with his paw. He instantly disappeared and reappeared in front of his opponent in the blink of an eye, clawing at the river of chaos. Behind him, Heaven's Fate also attacked!However, it was not to deal with Zheng Yu. At this moment, he threw a punch at the man with the sword on his back!The sword-carrying man didn't move at all. It was as if he had turned into a puppet and his body was about to be destroyed. Seeing this, Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly. Li daoheng's previous incarnation was also one of his advancement resources. He didn't devour it before because he was waiting to capture his reincarnation.At this moment, he watched as one person seized his river of chaos and the other seized li daoheng's previous life body, which he was about to devour.His expression changed and he disappeared. He reappeared in front of the man with the sword and snorted,""If you insist on forcing me to become a saint Emperor, then I'll grant your wish!"He reached out and grabbed the sword way clone. Instantly, an extremely powerful devouring force appeared.The sword path clone didn't resist at all.Waves of powerful energy were swallowed into Zheng Yu's body.Zheng Yu's aura continued to soar!At the same time, Li Hao suddenly said,""Li daoheng, are you done playing?"Zheng Yu was stunned.Subconsciously, he looked down at Dao Jian, who was still at a loss. From the beginning to the end, he really didn't know what had happened.Li Hao's voice rose again."I am heaven's will. I have merged with second cat's body and can see through all illusions ... Can you hide it from me?"At this moment, the man with the sword on his back, who was being devoured ...​ His originally dull eyes suddenly revealed some light.The next moment, an extremely powerful sword intent emerged from the sword-carrying man's body. As he slashed out, Zheng Yu's expression changed drastically. Just as he was about to retreat, he suddenly realized that the energy he had just absorbed was going berserk in his body!In an instant, the sword pierced through him!Zheng Yu could only feel countless energy flowing out of his body. His strength, which was originally close to that of a venerable sovereign, was swallowed by the sword-carrying man in front of him in an instant. It was still flowing into his body!The man with the sword on his back was proud and aloof. At this moment, he was no longer dull. Just like what Li Hao had seen in the seal that day, he said that he would kill the red moon sovereign sooner or later. This moment seemed to be the same as that time!The sword-carrying man looked at Li Hao and stretched out his hand, which transformed into a long sword. Tens of thousands of swords enveloped Zheng Yu, and under Zheng Yu's astonished gaze, he pierced his hand into his body and continuously devoured his power. He slightly raised his brows."Li Hao, you've ruined my plan!"  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ This scene shocked everyone again.Zheng Yu's aura began to weaken. He was in disbelief."You ... Didn't reincarnate?"The man with the sword looked at him and said in a calm tone,""Why do you want to reincarnate? I'm just sealing my Six Senses and trying to comprehend a new Dao. Why do I have to reincarnate? What was the use of reincarnation in this imperfect world? Will I still be me after reincarnation?""Zhan Tiandi, celestial ruler BA, and the others are so-called reincarnations, but do they still think they are themselves? With the previous experience, why should I reincarnate and cultivate again?"He revealed a cold and arrogant smile,"I've merely sealed my Six Senses!" It's just nice to rest for a while. You'll prepare everything for me, won't you? You see, I'll be resting for a while, and you've already prepared everything, right?"Zheng Yu couldn't believe it. He lowered his head to look at the Dao sword below and coughed violently."Then he ..."

The man with the sword on his back was li daoheng. The real li daoheng also lowered his head to take a look and smiled. "What's wrong with him? He's quite talented, but he's nothing. I still have some power left in the husband Dao sword, but I can't use it anymore. Since Li Hao and the others don't like it, why can't I give it to him?"At this moment, the ninth master was also stunned. He looked at the man with the sword in disbelief.""You're ... Alive?"Li daoheng turned his head and looked. At this moment, he was connected to Zheng Yu. The power in Zheng Yu's body was constantly flowing into his body. Li daoheng's eyes were filled with arrogance."Of course I'm alive! Don't tell me you really think I'm dead, or like this idiot, think I've reincarnated?""Reincarnation? Just as Li Hao said, wasn't it better to cultivate oneself than to cultivate others? Will I still be me after reincarnation?"He sneered and looked at Li Hao.""Little guy, you're so annoying! 'Can't you wait a little longer? wait for this guy to devour the river of chaos and me completely. Wait until he corroborates his Dao and then call me!' This way, it'll be much easier for me to become a saint Emperor in one step!""You didn't reincarnate?" Heaven's Fate sighed."I thought you reincarnated. It seems like ... You've been awake all this time."Li daoheng continued to absorb Zheng Yu's power, and Zheng Yu was struggling violently at this moment. With some disbelief, he roared,""So ... You never had a previous life ... It has always been you! You schemed against me?""Don't you like to drag me down?"Li daoheng was extremely calm,"you're very annoying, like a fly!" I've always felt that you're in control of everything. Since that's the case ... I'll give you a chance! But you don't seem to be useful!"Endless energy was flowing into his body.Li daoheng's aura instantly became extremely powerful. At this moment, in the void, the vague image of Thunder appeared. Li daoheng raised his head and looked at the sky, somewhat regretfully."I don't need to be tested. The lightning tribulation ... Is very annoying! I could've just let Zheng Yu undergo the Tribulation, but you had to wake me up in advance. Now that the lightning tribulation is coming, it seems that I can only undergo the Tribulation myself!"He didn't seem to like going through tribulations, not because he was afraid, but because there was no tribulation to become a great emperor!At this moment, Zheng Yu started to struggle madly. Li daoheng chuckled,""You've fused with my true body many times and absorbed quite a bit of my sword intent. You and I are one now. Can you break free?""You two better not Stop Me Now. Otherwise ... I might use you two as sacrifices when I wake up!"At this moment, Zheng Yu completely understood and was a little crazy."Kill him ... Li daoheng, you want to absorb me? impossible ..."BOOM!In his body, powerful energy rolled wildly, and even a great Dao of origin appeared. He struggled madly, shaking the void.At this moment, Zheng Yu was filled with despair and unwillingness!He was about to succeed!Suddenly, li daoheng appeared. Or rather, he had always been there, from the beginning to the end. He had deliberately made himself think that he had reincarnated. The Taoist sword or not was all fake.He, li daoheng, had never reincarnated! Off to the side, Tian Ji frowned and looked up at the sky. The Tribulation lightning was about to appear. This was the true tribulation of a venerable Emperor. By the looks of it, even if he corroborated his Dao and became an Emperor on the Silver Moon, as long as he was an essence venerable Emperor, he would still attract the Tribulation.This also proved that neo martial still existed, and the origin was still there. Even the land of Silver Moon was not too far away from neo martial.Then, he glanced at Li Hao and frowned.""Can you still escape?"I resurrected two cats for the blood Emperor, not a human and a cat. Li Hao wouldn't have taken the two cats and decided not to leave, would he?"Yes, I can!""It's just that this senior cat seems to be in a daze," Li Hao said."It's not fully awake yet ... I'll borrow its body for a while."Tian Ji looked at li daoheng, then at the struggling Zheng Yu, and frowned.""These two fellows used a hundred thousand years to scheme against each other ..."He was also speechless!Zheng Yu felt that everything was under his control. He seized li daoheng's previous incarnation, but li daoheng didn't reincarnate at all. Instead, he used these decades to merge with Zheng Yu and devour Zheng Yu.The two of them were not good people!They had been fighting since a hundred thousand years ago, and it seemed that li daoheng had won.At this time, the Thunder tribulation was about to appear. Li daoheng was about to vindicate his Dao and become a monarch. He was stopping him now. This was not the chaos Thunder tribulation, but the Tribulation of a venerable sovereign. He knew very well that if he attacked now, the Tribulation of a venerable sovereign would attack those who interfered.He looked at Li Hao. What should he do now?He didn't like to think about this. At present, second cat had recovered, so his mission was completed. The premise was that he could bring second cat back to new martial.But now, this guy had proven his Dao and become an Emperor ... Once he succeeded, he would probably not let them go.Li Hao didn't say anything. He raised his head and looked at the sky, at the incoming lightning tribulation.The Tribulation of a venerable sovereign!Judging from its aura ... It was even more powerful than the chaos lightning tribulation. The chaos lightning tribulation he had encountered had only been an extremely weak one, but the Tribulation of a venerable sovereign was meant to test them.The key was that this thing was an indiscriminate attack!Everything that happened today was changing, and the changes were far beyond Li Hao's imagination.Between li daoheng and Zheng Yu, there was one in each other. Right now, Zheng Yu seemed to be at a disadvantage. Although he wasn't completely devoured, he couldn't escape. Once the lightning struck, li daoheng might use him as a shield to survive the lightning tribulation.

Li Hao exhaled. At this moment, he maintained his cat form. His breath caused a lot of movement.Li daoheng was still holding onto the river of chaos.Hong Yitang was also within the devouring range.Once he became an Emperor ... There was no way to resist."These two guys ... They're really troublesome!"Li Hao shook his head. At this moment, he suddenly devoured the sky, and an extremely powerful devouring force spread across the void!At the same time, a weak time river appeared!A little bit of the power of the river appeared on the cat's body, as if it was going to go back to the past and the future!On the other side, li daoheng was still absorbing Zheng Yu's power and preparing to face the lightning tribulation. He wasn't worried that Li Hao and the others would interfere. Whoever interfered would be finished. However, he suddenly turned to look at Li Hao."Welcome me!" Li Hao shouted in a low voice.Go over?Even celestial pole was shocked!è‰¹!What past?You're now a cat. Your past ...At this moment, heaven and earth seemed to be collapsing. In the distant void, in the endless past, a big cat seemed to appear. It was faintly discernible, as if it was at a loss, confused, and strange.However, Li Hao didn't care about this at all. He flew toward the actual universe!At this moment, a star emerged in the reality Dao universe. At this moment, this star was motionless, as if it was looking at Li Hao in a daze, or as if it was looking at the big cat in the endless space-time.At the end of the world, there was a cat that looked exactly the same as the two cats that Li Hao had possessed. However ... They were slightly different. They seemed to be fatter, more cunning, and much stronger!The fat cat turned to look at them with some confusion, surprise, and doubt. It was full of intelligence."Meow ... Cat? Second cat?"At this moment, the sky collapsed, the earth sank, and the firmament split open. The real Time and Stars seemed to be about to split apart. Li Hao seemed to have backtracked to something incredible!Neither the blood Emperor's appearance nor Li Hao's future self had caused such a huge commotion.However, at this moment, Li Hao recalled the past of the cat he had possessed ... It was as if he had pierced through the heavens!At this moment, even li daoheng, who was about to become a venerable Emperor, changed his expression.How could this be?The struggling Zheng Yu had forgotten to struggle. He looked at the sky in a daze, at the cat at the end of the world. The cat seemed to want to come and take a look!However, the river of time that Li Hao had conjured did not seem to be enough to contain this person!The river of time was collapsing!Around Li Hao, the real time star was also trembling, as if it was still very weak, very weak, far less powerful than the cat."Eh ... This bridge is so weak!""I can't ..."The cat, at the end of the world, mumbled to itself,"second cat seems to be alive!"The cat seemed to be too heavy and fat. When it walked into the river of time, the river collapsed and collapsed. Li Hao's soul trembled violently in disbelief. He did not come to summon the cat, but to make the spacetime star curious. He came to capture the spacetime star.In the end ...Now, not only was the time star curious, but it was also a little afraid. The cat seemed to be coming, but the river of time could not hold it."Meow ... I can't go over! It's so far ... Is it that little run-down place? I don't seem to be able to find it ... We're fighting! I can't go over ... I won't go over ... Remember to come and find me!""It's so fun here. We killed so many people, and I've raised so many fish ... Eh, little celestial pole is still here ..."The cat mumbled to itself at the end of the endless void.The next moment, he seemed to feel that the river was about to collapse completely. He said helplessly,"I can't go ... It's so far. Where are you guys floating to?"At this moment, as if it had seen something, a millstone-like object suddenly appeared in its paw. On that millstone, there seemed to be lightning flashing. The huge fat cat muttered to itself,"Eh ... Tribulation? Will you see second cat?" In an instant, it opened its mouth and devoured the power of Thunder. It burped and muttered to itself,""Then we won't cross it. If there's a chance in the future, we'll cross it again, okay? Second cat seems to have just come to life and is very weak!"In the sky of the Silvermoon world, the lightning disappeared!Li daoheng looked up at the sky in a daze, and so did Zheng Yu. In an instant, the lightning was gone. Without the lightning ... How could one vindicate Dao and become an Emperor?He suddenly laughed, and his laughter was somewhat crazy!"Hahaha!"The lightning was gone!The winding river collapsed completely at this moment. The huge cat seemed to be a little regretful."If you don't look for me later, I'll look for you after I'm done with them! Fighting is boring, but if you fight and kill them, they can become fish ... I'll leave some fish for you, let's eat fish together!"BOOM!The shadow disappeared, and at this moment, the entire Silver Moon fell into a deathly silence.Li Hao's soul was trembling. He couldn't care less. While the Chronostar was still in a daze, he escaped from ermao's body and entered the real Chronostar!Not far away, li daoheng looked at the sky in a daze. The next moment, he roared,""Bastard!"Although he said that he didn't want to undergo the Tribulation ...However, in the post-neo martial world, how could a venerable sovereign become a sovereign without crossing the Tribulation?In the end ... There was no more!The lightning was gone!Across time and space, across chaos, across an image of the past, Emperor Cang had swallowed his lightning of Dao validation!Tell him to cross the Tribulation in a few days, don't hurt second cat!"How could it be like this!"Li daoheng mumbled. How could Li Hao summon Emperor Cang? his power of time was not enough to summon this person.No matter how confident and arrogant he was, he knew that even if he did become an Emperor, he would be swallowed whole by the other party. However, Li Hao couldn't have summoned it!He turned his head and saw that a star was rolling violently, and the entire Silver Moon seemed to have stopped.The power of time overflowed into the heavens and earth!Everybody ... No, except for them, fell into a dead silence. They stared at the rolling Star in a daze. Was it this star that provided Li Hao with energy?It was obvious that this star was also curious about what it was.However, this star did not seem to be able to carry Emperor Cang."Li Hao!"Li daoheng shouted coldly and slashed at the star with his sword!Damn it!All of these changes, not to mention him, no one had expected it. The apparition of Emperor Cang had appeared and cut off his hopes of becoming a monarch. At this moment, he was somewhat at a loss. How can I become a monarch?As for celestial pole, he was also speechless!He had almost summoned Emperor Cang over. If he had really been summoned ... That would be interesting. The entire Silver Moon might have been devoured by the other party in one bite! Li Hao was also crazy and bold!Of course, he shouldn't have been eaten.At this moment, Li Hao clung to the star crazily. Gritting his teeth, he resisted the freezing power of time and began to merge himself into the Star!If you don't melt me, I'll melt you!The entire Silvermoon world had turned into a spiritual world. He wanted to integrate the star into his Dao Meridian. Although there were many changes, Li Hao had finally completed his plan.The premise was that he could really leave this star behind."Don't run ... I'll take you to play ..."Li Hao said with great difficulty, as if he was coaxing a child. This time star probably hadn't fully matured yet. Regardless of that, he should first make her stop struggling!
