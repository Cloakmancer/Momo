        a sword intent locked onto the body of the fire Phoenix spear.
         The Soul of the Fire Phoenix emerged on the spear. The fire Phoenix's eyes seemed to be filled with fear. When it saw the Golden spear nearby, the fire Phoenix spear immediately hid behind the Golden spear.
         Escape!
         It was afraid!
         It was afraid of Li Hao and this sword intent. In the depths of its broken memories, it seemed to have seen such a terrifying sword.
         The fiery phoenix spear was in no mood to deal with Li Hao after hou Xiaochen's attack, but now it was forced to run and hide behind the Golden spear.
         In the next second, a powerful sword intent covered the Golden spear.
         Golden Spear's expression changed slightly.
         Li Hao ... Had retaliated?
         Under the suppression of hou bu's spear intent, he was actually able to counterattack. Furthermore, he was able to counterattack with an unprecedented sword strike.
          The Golden spear didn't want to take it head-on. He just wanted to avoid it.
         However, when he sensed it, the sword ... Had locked onto him!
         Jin Jin didn't have the time to think about anything else. In the next moment, a long spear appeared. With a low shout, he struck out!
         The spear was like fire, illuminating the void.
         The Spear's consciousness was revealed!
         It was incomparably powerful. Just its inner strength alone was enough to shake the air and shatter the surrounding trees. The Golden spear was worthy of its name!
         BOOM!
         An earth-shaking explosion erupted, and a heatwave swept in all directions. The Golden spear wielded its spear, and its spear intent burst forth. With a single strike, it directly shattered Li Hao's fused sword intent, causing it to dissipate.
         His Spear's consciousness also instantly dispersed.
         The Golden spear stood on the spot without moving.
         He only stared at Li Hao in the distance, as if he could see the spear and the sword in Li Hao's divine will, exploding, colliding, and fighting ...
         Li Hao's sword intent had already dissipated in reality.
         The collision between him and the Golden spear only caused a large area of damage. The surrounding grass and trees were all broken, but there was no other damage.
         Jin Jin held his spear and looked at Li Hao without moving.
         After an unknown period of time, a small cut appeared on Jin Jin's forehead. A drop of blood slowly dripped down and landed on the ground.
         At this moment, Jin Jin gently touched his forehead. His eyes were filled with unconcealable shock.
         His sword Qi had already dissipated.
         However ... At the same time as it collapsed, there was a sense of determination. An extremely fast explosion instantly exploded. At the last moment, it still gave him some counterattacks and pierced his forehead.
         It wasn't a serious injury. It was just a small wound. To the Golden spear, the wound would heal with just a little inner strength.
         However, Jin gun's heart was not calm.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was not calm at all.
         In his life, he had experienced this kind of uneasiness three times.
         The first time, he was defeated by Yuan Shuo. Yuan Shuo's intent of five birds had suppressed him and rendered him unable to fight back. This had troubled him for many years.
          The second time, hou Xiaochen broke the demon of five birds with a single spear strike, allowing him to successfully advance to the Qian warrior realm. That day, he experienced what Li Hao was experiencing right now. In the Divine Will, hou Xiaochen won the battle between the spear and the five birds because he was too strong.  The first two times had shocked him for many years.
         And the third time was now.
         Li Hao wasn't too strong, at least not as strong as Jin gun. At this moment, Jin gun's heart was in turmoil after seeing Li Hao's sword attack.
         The moment the sword Qi exploded, he seemed to understand the young man in front of him.
         Unwilling, unyielding, unyielding!
         Even if you're hou Xiaochen!
         I, Li Hao, will still not back down from that hou Xiaochen who killed the rising light with a single strike ...
         It was rare to see such a person among the younger generation of martial masters, or rather, he had never seen one before. Whether it was Wang Qing or Kong Youyun, they did not seem to have such extreme determination and unwillingness.
         Why did Li Hao feel such extreme unwillingness?
         He knew Li Hao's background, but Li Hao had never experienced such a dangerous situation. He seemed to have been very successful. He had smoothly become Yuan Shuo's disciple, smoothly passed the Silver City's crisis, smoothly walked out of heaven battling city, and smoothly killed Yu Xiao ...
         Looking carefully at Li Hao's resume, he found that it had been a smooth-sailing journey. There were no major setbacks. As for failures, there was no need to even mention them.
         Why?
         While the Golden spear was still in doubt, an explosion that could only be sensed by the Divine Will erupted and collided.
         BOOM!
         It was a spiritual collision.
         The Golden Spear's vision blurred, and two people seemed to appear in front of it-Li Hao and hou Xiaochen. One held a spear, and the other a sword. At this moment, the spear and the sword collided in the void, both of them extremely powerful and explosive!
         The long spear split the long sword apart. The spear will was extremely powerful. However, in the blink of an eye, the long sword was like a tiger that had been released from its cage. It exploded with an unprecedented unwillingness and anger. A flame burned the world and the long spear!
         The mountain peak was broken, and the Tiger was dying!
         At that moment, golden spear saw Li Hao wave his hand. Using his hand as a sword, he was extremely fast, so fast that he ignored time and space. Only that sword cut toward the sky without any distracting thoughts!
         The dying Tiger instantly merged into his arm, and the broken mountain peak reappeared.
         He used his arm as a sword and slashed at the broken spear.
         BOOM!
          The rumbling sound from the divine decree shook the surroundings. The Golden spear was slightly dazed. It was as if he had seen the mountains and rivers explode and the sky split open. What kind of scene was that?
         He had never seen such a thing in his life.
         The starry sky seemed to be shattering.
         "I'm not afraid of you!"
         At this moment, a roar rang out in his mind.
         It was Li Hao's voice. He said that he was not afraid!
         ……
         Li Hao let out a roar that he had been suppressing.
         I am not afraid of you!
         Little Yuan, I'm not afraid of this thing. I won't retreat again. I won't be unable to move my trembling legs anymore. I'm not afraid.
        
         I'm going to shatter all of this!
         The arm exploded. Li Hao swung his sword and cut through the sky, shattering the last part of the spear with a boom. With a roar, he slashed again, as if he was slashing at the invisible red shadow.
         Ying Hongyue, I'm not afraid of you either!
         "Kill!"
         Only the sounds of battle resounded throughout the world.
         However, at this moment, only one person was watching the battle. The others did not feel anything. Only Jin gun had seen it all. He saw Li Hao break the spear and completely shatter hou Xiaochen's spear will!
         BOOM!
         There was another loud sound, and the body of the fire Phoenix spear trembled.
         Li Hao spat out a mouthful of blood. In the next moment, his arm suddenly split open, and sword energy overflowed, shooting out blood arrows in all directions.
         His right arm was bleeding profusely.
          Li Hao panted heavily, like a dying fish. He greedily breathed in and out, with blood still flowing from his seven orifices. At this moment, he smiled and looked at the Golden spear not far away.
         "Captain ... I'm sorry!"
         Jin Jin looked at him for a long time, then said in a deep voice,""You ... That's too risky!"
         What a crazy fellow!
         He had actually triggered the spear intent of the Marquis and had inconceivably shattered that person's spear intent.
         Other than saying that it was too risky, he didn't know what else to say about this young man.
         What are you afraid of?
         What are you crushing?
         No matter what he was afraid of, Li Hao had won.
         Jin Jin was dazed for a moment."If I could be as determined as Li Hao and break the suppression of the five birds, then can I ... Break through to the Qian warrior realm?"
         Would he be stronger than he was now?
         He felt a little regretful, but it quickly turned into helplessness.
         I've tried!
         But I can't break that curse.
         If he were to regret it now, he would appear even more useless.
         He knew in his heart that if Li Hao was the Martial Master suppressed by Yuan Shuo in the past, this person ... Might be able to break Yuan Shuo's curse and become a new self.
         When he thought of this, he felt that it was unbelievable.
         Not far away, Li Hao was still gasping for breath. He wiped the blood off his face, and the wound on his arm looked terrible. Li Hao took off his shirt and wrapped it around his right arm so that no one would see the wound.
         He revealed a smile and managed to regain his combat strength. His body seemed to have been completely emptied. His inner strength, essence, Qi, and spirit felt the same as when he used the blood saber technique. In fact, they were even more serious than when he used the blood saber technique.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, it was different from the blood Blade technique. After using the blood Blade technique, he felt as if he had been devoured. This time, he felt as if he had been reborn.
         One was walking towards death, while the other was walking towards new life.
         Golden spear also returned from his memory. Looking at Li Hao, he didn't know what to say. In the end, the words that were at the tip of his tongue became,"Li Hao, go back and rest for a day. When you wake up, you'll be a new student!"
         With that, he turned around and left.
         As he walked, he actually felt a little regretful that he didn't say what he wanted to say.
         In fact, he wanted to say that if the Seven Swords of the Silver Moon were twenty years ago, it would be the eight swords of the Silver Moon today. Not only that, Li Hao's sword was the second, if not the first, of the eight swords. In the eyes of the Golden spear, it was only inferior to the heavenly Sword, and could even rival it.
         Li Hao might be one of the top thirty-six heroes in the game, and one of the top ones at that.
         The heavenly Sword had broken Yuan Shuo's suppression back then?
         The Golden spear did not know.
         Maybe there was, maybe there wasn 't, because Tian Jian had left on his own. No one knew if he could break the rules or if he would leave after breaking the rules. With Tian Jian's personality, if he didn't break Yuan Shuo's will, would he be willing to leave?
          ……  Behind him, Li Hao chuckled.
         He staggered to his feet, feeling an indescribable pleasure.
         Suddenly, he pointed his middle finger at the South.
         Ying Hongyue was nothing more than this!
         The red shadow was no longer my inner demon. This red shadow was you, Ying Hongyue!
         As for hou Xiaochen's spear that had killed Xuguang, it would no longer affect him.
         "I've seen the Grandmaster, how can I be suppressed by you ..."
         Li Hao laughed and extended his hand toward the Phoenix spear in the distance."Come here, I won't cut you. If you dare to run again, I'll cut you in half!"
         The fire Phoenix spear seemed to be a little afraid. After struggling for a while, it quickly flew back into Li Hao's hand.
         Li Hao waved it around and suddenly laughed. The last bit of his strength entered the fiery phoenix spear. Without any resistance, he thrust the spear forward. The spear broke through the void, and the fire spread!
         If chief Yu and the others were here, they would probably be shocked beyond words.
         Origin God weapons could only have one master.
         Apart from the master, unless the master lent it to you, you would not be able to display the power of an origin god weapon.
         Or the master was dead.
         But at this moment, Li Hao didn't hesitate at all. With a slight move, he actually made the fire Phoenix spear burst out with the power of an origin divine weapon.
         "The gun's not bad, but I'm not used to it ..."
         Li Hao shook his head and laughed again."Soul-splitting ... So the hou tribe's spear is called soul-splitting."
         It wasn't the fire Phoenix spear, but hou Xiaochen's spear technique.
         The spear struck out and split the spirit.
         He seemed to have vaguely read about this spear technique in an ancient book. Li Hao fell into deep thought. As he walked, he thought about it. However, he felt that his brain was not enough. At this moment, he was a little dizzy.
         Forget it, who cares.
         I don't use a gun.
         The Phoenix spear, on the other hand, was extremely obedient, allowing Li Hao to wave it as he pleased. Even though this guy was using the spear as a walking stick, it did not move at all. If it were Hao lianchuan, he would have been burned by the Phoenix spear.
         ……
         At this moment.
         In the valley, hou Xiaochen suddenly stopped and looked at the White moon City in the distance, frowning.
         "Li Hao?"
         He murmured to himself. This little brat, who he only cared about being the bloodline descendant of the eight great families, seemed ... Somewhat different.
          My Spear's consciousness has dissipated.
         It was faster than he had imagined. Was it an expert who had broken through his spear intent, or was it Li Hao?
         If it was a powerhouse, needless to say, that was only the will he left behind. It did not mean that the other party could defeat him.
         However, if Li Hao ... Defeated his will, did this mean that Li Hao was stronger than his peers?
         "First, it was Yuan Shuo, then it was Li Hao ... Is this lineage really that strong?"
         Hou Xiaochen suddenly laughed with anticipation.
         He looked forward to this bloodline growing to his level. At that time, he might be able to see the truth.
         This time, if Li Hao had really broken through his spear intent, Silver Moon would probably have another top-notch Martial Master, an existence comparable to Heavenly Sword tyrant saber and the others.
         After letting out a breath, hou Xiaochen disappeared.
         Whether or not he was Li Hao, he would know when he got back.
        
         Li Hao staggered back to the dormitory building. Before he could see Liu Long and the others, he fell to the ground and fell asleep.
         This sleep was especially sweet.
         She even had a dream, a beautiful dream.
         He dreamed of the past, when he and Zhang Yuan had secretly barbecued in his backyard. The barbecue was very, very fragrant, so fragrant that Li Hao's saliva was almost dripping.
         In the dream, Li Hao took a closer look and saw that the barbecued meat was actually red.
         It exploded with a crisp sound!
         One red shadow after another, he ate it very deliciously. After he finished, his whole body was on fire, making Li Hao think that he was on fire.
         In the end, he saw that the blood Qi was too thick, and it was even emitting a blood light.
         ……
         Li Hao woke up.
          She woke up from being too full.
         In the dream, he and Zhang Yuan ate countless Red Shadows together. They were roasted, stewed, fried ...
         He would get it however delicious it was.
         At the end of the meal, Li Hao couldn't take it anymore, so he woke up.
         Opening his eyes, Li Hao felt full.
         He was a little dazed. 'I ate the red shadow in my dreams. Could it really be useful?'
         He felt that his inner strength had increased a little.
         He took a closer look ... And was speechless.
         The small sword was lying beside him.
         The sword energy was used up.
         Li Hao looked up at the sky and was speechless for a long time. He understood that he had probably used the breathing technique of five birds in his sleep. He hadn't eaten too much, but had absorbed too much sword energy.
         He had absorbed all the sword energy in the small sword.
         Because his body was injured, he needed to replenish his energy.
         Therefore, he absorbed the sword energy.
         Li Hao was speechless. I thought I could really kill people and eat Red Shadows in my dreams, but it turns out that I'm eating my own food, and my sword energy has been used up again.
         However, the injury on his arm had recovered.
         Some of the internal injuries in his body had also recovered after he had unleashed that sword attack.
         "The life of a wastrel!"
         Li Hao shook his head and sighed. Forget it, I'll treat you in my dream. Little Yuan has already eaten half of my food. In the past, I didn't have money, so I didn't treat you much. Today, I've treated you to a big meal. Little Yuan should be satisfied.
         As expected, I'm still very generous.
         Thinking this through, Li Hao smiled.
         He felt his body and found that his inner strength was indeed stronger than before. His qi and blood were also stronger than before. His meridians were thicker, and his bones were stronger. The depression in his heart had been reduced by a lot.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He took out three divine power stones and crushed them. The fire Phoenix spear seemed to be ready to absorb them.
         Li Hao picked up the small sword and used the five birds breathing technique. The small sword unwillingly absorbed the energy, and the fire Phoenix spear became obedient.
         Disobedient. If the little sword was hungry, it might eat the Phoenix leg.
         The three divine power stones allowed the small sword to recover some of its sword energy. Li Hao checked the five divine power stones in his ring and frowned. He had spent money too quickly. He had so many divine power stones before, but it had only been a short while.
         If not for the fact that they had obtained some, they would have spent all of them.
         Were these weapons from the ancient civilization all gluttons?
          He sensed his body again. A moment later, Li Hao focused on his lungs.  There seemed to be something strange in his lungs.
         Li Hao sensed it carefully. It didn't seem to be all 'force', but what was it if it wasn 't' force '?
         He had slashed out with an extreme burst of power. Li Hao felt that he had comprehended force, the third force, gold sword force.
         However, at this moment, the thing in his lungs did not seem to be completely Shi.
         The Divine Will appeared, and Li Hao silently felt it.
         A moment later, his eyes were slightly strange, which should be considered momentum.
         However, his terrain was a mountain, and the fire was a Tiger. He thought that the golden sword force could be a Phoenix or a bird. After all, it was converted from the flying bird technique, so it was normal for a bird to appear.
         However, that was not the case.
         Li Hao took a closer look and saw a dot.
         Yes, it was a dot the size of a ball.
         They were like marbles.
         "It's a ball? Still a dot?"
         Li Hao's face was blank. Why did the metal sword form have such a form?
         This shouldn't be the case.
         Force, secret skill, and comprehension were all related. Whether it was a secret skill or comprehension, the metal sword force should not be just a single point.
         Li Hao frowned. Did he fail?
         Or could it be that it was just an initial comprehension, and the force was too weak, resulting in this situation?
         He pondered for a moment and decided to give it a try. He moved the small dot into his lungs bit by bit.
         Li Hao prepared to use the third move.
         When the golden sword force entered his lungs, it was very quiet and seemed very weak. Li Hao felt a little strange. He felt that the golden sword force would not be weak, but in reality, whether it was a mountain or a Tiger, they both struggled hard after entering the five viscera locking force.
         The golden sword force didn't struggle.
         Forget it, I'll try.
         A thick chain appeared in Li Hao's lungs. It was a Super Lock.
         The Super Lock locked onto the little ball.
         In the past, Tigers and mountains would struggle, but this time, the ball was so quiet that it made Li Hao feel uneasy. It allowed the chain to approach.
         Just as Li Hao was feeling a little nervous.
         Suddenly, a light spot exploded in his lungs.
          It was so fast that Li Hao himself didn't even have time to react.
         The next moment, a crisp sound rang out in Li Hao's mind.
         "Pfft!"
         Li Hao's body, which had just recovered, was now full of wounds from the impact. He kept vomiting blood, his face pale.
         At this moment, the light spot disappeared.
         ,m Li Hao's expression changed drastically!  Within the divine intent, his lungs underwent a huge change. The small golden dot of light returned to its original state, extremely quiet and unmoving.
         However, there was an obvious crack on the chain of the giant Super Lock.
         Li Hao's face turned green!
         At this moment, he quickly controlled the Super Lock and hid it. He quickly moved the small light spot out of his lungs. There was only fear and shock on his face.
        
         F * ck!
         An extreme burst!
         'This thing actually played dirty. It exploded in an instant and almost broke my superpower lock.'
         Once the Super Lock in his lungs was broken ... The consequences would be unimaginable.
         Li Hao would instantly become a super, and a metal-type one at that.
         But ... Was that the result Li Hao wanted?
         It was not easy for him to reach this point. He had comprehended the three forces, and his martial arts path was smooth. Now that the superpower lock was broken, Li Hao might become a strong Esper very soon ...
         But was that what he wanted?
         Li Hao was still in shock. He sensed that the Super Lock in his lungs had been damaged. A crack appeared, and he could vaguely feel some energy leaking out, transforming Li Hao's lungs.
         Li Hao didn't dare to be careless. This wasn't a good thing.
          At least not now.
         The superpower lock would be broken sooner or later, but not now. It was an existence that locked one's potential. Once broken, one would either become a superpower or completely release one's potential.
         Li Hao hadn't reached that stage yet.
         He quickly infused his internal strength into his lungs. Not only that, Li Hao hurriedly shattered another divine power Stone and began to absorb energy. Although he had used up all the metal-type stones, the divine power Stone had the effect of strengthening the whole body.
         He quickly replenished the inner strength, qi and blood, and energy into his lungs.
         Li Hao was extremely surprised!
         His lungs, which had absorbed 1000 cubic meters of metal elemental energy, were unable to contain the point formed by the metal sword force.
         "Metal sword force ... Point ... Burst from the point, the instantaneous extreme burst, the explosive power even exceeds the fire Tiger Force."
         At this moment, Li Hao had some understanding of this new Shi.
         This was what he had comprehended.
         Extreme explosive power!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Normally, it didn't seem to cause any damage, but in an instant, it was the strongest of the three forces, even if this force had just been comprehended.
         "So scary!"
         Li Hao clicked his tongue. If his superpower lock had been a little weaker just now, there would have been a problem.
         However, if that was the case, his lungs would not be able to contain this thing.
         He could either continue to strengthen his five internal organs and lungs, or he could only let the metal sword force exist on its own and not lock it down for the time being. If he couldn't lock it down, it meant that this thing wouldn't obediently merge with the fire Tiger Force and earth sword force into the superclass, and he could only fight it alone.
         " 1000 cubic meters of lungs can't even contain you?"
         Li Hao sensed the existence of that point in the divine decree. He thought that ferocious Tiger Force was already very domineering and powerful, but the instantaneous explosive power of the fruit-bearing golden sword force was even greater than ferocious Tiger Force.
         "He's strong ... But he's a bit of a cripple!"
         Li Hao sighed helplessly. He was both happy and in pain.
         He liked to be powerful.
         However, it was too powerful for his lungs to contain, which was another problem. Now that his five internal organs had reached a balance, it was not impossible to strengthen them further. Li Hao could also get some mysterious energy.
          However, his five internal organs were too strong. When the qi and blood attacked, he had to strengthen his body and bones to keep up.  This way, he would need more sword energy.
         Extracting mysterious energy also required sword energy.
         All in all, in conclusion ... He was running out of money.
         Li Hao had exchanged 1200 cubic meters of wind and thunder energy from the night patrolman, but he had not absorbed them yet. He had just used up one divine power Stone, so he had four left.
         In addition, the small sword had just absorbed three pieces ...
         Even if he absorbed all of them, he would only be able to absorb seven of them. After converting them into sword energy, it wouldn't be much. It might just be enough for Li Hao to convert all the mysterious energy.
         The small sword ate money, and the body ate money ...
         Even a rich man like Li Hao couldn't take it anymore.
         ,m Li Hao sighed and temporarily gave up on strengthening his five internal organs.  The metal sword force could not be fused yet.
         Can't take it!
         However, he could absorb the wind and lightning powers first to strengthen his bones and body. Otherwise, as his five internal organs and Shi became stronger and stronger, his body would become a shortcoming.
         Although inner strength was also being nurtured, it was a slow process. If he wanted to see an immediate effect ... He still had to rely on sword energy.
         He looked out of the window and saw that it was already dark.
         He looked at the clock again. It was past threeo' clock.
         It should be three in the morning. It was not convenient to look for other people at this time.
         Li Hao didn't care anymore. He took out his storage ring and absorbed the dual abilities of wind and thunder. The three divine power stones that the small sword had just absorbed were probably not enough. He hoped that the sword could finish absorbing the divine power stones before the remaining ones were used up.
         Only when one's body was strong could one strengthen the five internal organs. The five internal organs clearly surpassed the body by a large margin.
         If his five internal organs were too weak, he would not be able to support it.
         If his five internal organs were too strong, that wouldn't work either, as the burden on his body was too great.
         Balance was the most important thing. Otherwise, he would either become a sick ghost coughing all day long or become a weak little scholar with a weak body. The slightest carelessness would cause it to be broken by the powerful qi and blood.
          Li Hao began to train again.
         The joy of comprehending force was also restrained. Although the appearance of metal sword force had increased his strength a little, it was not obvious. The key was that he could not integrate it into the general outline of sword force, so he could not build up his spirit.
         In the end, he was still too poor and did not have enough money.
         In fact, he had gained a lot of divine power stones and mysterious energy, but that was not enough for Li Hao to improve himself and absorb them like crazy.
         That night, Li Hao continuously absorbed wind and thunder, and his body began to strengthen.
         In the past, when he used his body as a sword, it would often shatter because his body wasn't strong enough to withstand Shi. Now that he was even stronger, if he dared to use his body as a sword again in the future, it would be as simple as crushing his flesh and blood.
         Strengthening his body and bone armor was also imperative.
         ……
         It was dawn.
         Li Hao was still absorbing the lightning energy. His bone armor crackled, and the lightning energy surrounded his bone armor. He was honing his bones.
        
         ? Li Hao was also surrounded by lightning.
         After a long time, the lightning dissipated.
         Li Hao opened his eyes and sensed that his body, bones, and armor had become much stronger, but ... He sighed heavily and helplessly.
         The dual powers of wind and lightning had absorbed a total of 1200 cubic meters.
         He had used more than three divine power stones.
         Three was not enough!
         In the latter half of the night, he broke two more divine power stones. At this moment, Li Hao only had two divine power stones left, and the sword energy in the small sword was exhausted.
         Li Hao looked at the remaining two pieces. One was dark and the other light.
         Originally, he wanted to try absorbing it himself ...
         But now, forget it.
          He was worried that the small sword didn't have any sword energy.
         The sword energy was the greatest guarantee.
         "Earning money is to spend. Spending money to strengthen yourself and then earning money again is a virtuous cycle."
         Li Hao comforted himself.
         He didn't think too much about it. He broke the last two divine power stones and let the small sword absorb them.
         At this point, the divine power Stone and the mysterious energy in his hands were completely exhausted.
         And all of this was not in vain.
         After paying such a huge price, Li Hao's benefit was that he had comprehended the third stance. His body, bones, and armor were strengthened, and he was stronger than before. Next, his five internal organs could probably be strengthened a little.
         As soon as possible, he would fuse the metal sword force into his five internal organs. If he could fuse the three forces, Li Hao felt that as long as he succeeded, he would reach the peak of the three yang realm. At the very least, he would not be weaker than Huang Jie.
         At that time, he would probably have surpassed Yuan Shuo's level when he fought with the eyebrows-abrest stick.
         At that time, his teacher had fused two powers.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had completed the fusion of the three stances. According to his thoughts and judgment, he might be a bit stronger than his teacher, but there was a limit to his strength. As for the specifics, it would depend on actual combat. His teacher was much more experienced than him.
         "When teacher left, it was the 27th ... Today is the 13th of September ..."
         Li Hao was in a daze. It felt like a long time had passed.
         But in reality, it had only been 16 days.
         Sixteen days ago, his teacher was still a Supreme existence. Sixteen days later, if his teacher didn't make any progress ... Li Hao felt that he could challenge his teacher.
         " 16 days. Can teacher complete the third stance, the accumulation of spirit? His five internal organs aren't strong, but I heard that he killed many people from the Crimson Moon to strengthen them. If there are enough clones of the blood God, maybe ... Teacher has already completed the fusion of the third power. "
         Yuan Shuo's fusion wasn't that complicated. When his five organs were stronger, he could just fuse them together directly. There was no need for him to comprehend or try. He could just stuff them in.
         Therefore, if there were enough clones of Blood God, not to mention the third force, even the fourth or fifth force could be possible.
         The thoughts he had just had disappeared instantly.
         There was a high probability that ... He still couldn't win against his teacher.
         Unless he completed the fusion of the five Forces faster than his teacher.
         He got up. He was not used to his strengthened body.
         However, it didn't take long for Li Hao to finish his adaptation period.
         The divine decree was powerful, but the three forces were actually four forces. Li Hao's divine decree was getting stronger and stronger. His divine decree was strong, his mind was strong, but his body was still weak, so he was not too uncomfortable.  Normal martial masters would first strengthen their physical body before strengthening their divine intent.
         Li Hao was the opposite.
         The divine decree was getting stronger and stronger!
         At this moment, if he didn't control himself and let his divine will burst out at the same time, an ordinary Qian warrior would probably not be able to withstand it.
         Outside the building, the sun was shining brightly.
         Outside the small building, the Martial Master's Voice could be heard from afar.
         The training began again.
         Li Hao was in a good mood. Thinking that his Captain should be here already, his mood became even better.
         What a beautiful day!
         Before Liu Long and Li Hao could leave the room, a figure flickered and appeared at the door.
         Chief Steward Yu's expression was cold.
         It was obvious that she had arrived early.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Where's the fire Phoenix spear?"
         Li Hao gritted his teeth. How petty. I didn't say I wouldn't return it.
         He stretched out his hand and a long spear appeared. Then, he casually threw it at chief Yu.
         He had seen everything he needed to see, and the Phoenix spear was useless now. Apart from being quite strong, it was actually useless. Li Hao couldn't be bothered to keep it.
         Butler Yu caught it with one hand, and his eyes moved slightly.
         She glanced at Li Hao."You seem to have ... Changed again. Did you activate the Phoenix spear?"
         The Marquis's troops had already sealed off the gun.
         How did he activate it?
         "No, I didn 't!"
         He was lying through his teeth!
         Chief Steward Yu frowned but did not say anything. It was fine as long as the fire Phoenix spear was back in one piece.
         She glanced at Li Hao again and said coldly,""I've heard that you've been cultivating day and night for the past few days. It's not a good thing to be relaxed in the path of cultivation."
          Li Hao nodded in agreement.
         "You're right, chief. So, from today onwards, I won't be cultivating. "
         Chief Steward Yu didn't say anything else. He only looked at Li Hao a few more times. Li Hao seemed to be in a good mood.
         It seemed that he had indeed gained a lot.
         The gloominess between his brows seemed to have dissipated.
         "I'll take my leave now. Also, don't move around too much for the time being. A large number of powerful fighters from the Crimson Moon have swarmed into the Silver Moon to fight against the encirclement of the four major organizations. The Crimson Moon fighters from the 19 northern provinces are all gathering here ... Hao lianchuan was injured last night, and we lost some of our night patrols. The four major organizations have been attacked. All parties are currently discussing whether to give up on the previous plan and stop the encirclement ..."
         "You're a thorn in Red moon's side ... So, you should be careful. Red Moon doesn't have the guts to enter white moon City."
         "Oh?" Li Hao's eyes flickered."A large number of experts from the Crimson Moon?"
         "Not bad!"
         Chief Steward Yu nodded, but then he frowned slightly."The four organizations didn't kill many Crimson Moon elites, but some people did it in secret. The blood God's clone did attract everyone's attention, but we weren't the ones who really killed Crimson Moon and forced them to gather at Silver Moon."
        
         In fact, the strength of the four major organizations was limited. Even if there were experts, most of them would be in hiding.
         Therefore, the impact on the Crimson Moon was not that great.
         He killed a few superpowers below the three-sun realm. As for the three-sun realm ... Even though a few red moons had disappeared, it had nothing to do with the night watchmen and the others. Hao lianchuan himself was only in the mid-stage of the three-sun realm. How could he have killed a three-sun realm powerhouse so easily?
         If the four major organizations were to encircle and annihilate them, Blue Moon might not have made such a decision.
         But this time, it wasn't just the four major organizations that had made a move.
         The Silver Moon martial forest, the martial masters from all over the world, and even Yama and Fei Tian had secretly made their moves. This was the key to LAN Yue's desperate gamble and the reason why she had gathered countless experts to gather at Silver Moon in her exasperation.
         "Are there many Crimson Moon experts in the 19 northern provinces?"
         "Many."
         Chief Steward Yu was still cold."Even if there are thirty to fifty people in one province, there are nearly a thousand supers. On Red moon's side, the moon nether is the most powerful. There are many in solar brilliance. Even if there are two to three people in one province, there are dozens of them! It's said that Xu Guang might have sneaked in ... The three northern provinces were originally guarded by Xu Guang, but the three northern provinces are in chaos right now, so the intelligence Department deduced that Xu Guang might also come ... Try not to leave the city!"
         "Understood!"
          Li Hao nodded with a solemn expression.
         He couldn't afford to offend him!
         Not to mention that the three forces hadn't fused yet, even if they had, he still couldn't beat Xu Guang.
         Li Hao knew that with the fusion of the three forces, he could fight against a peak three-yang and even have a chance of killing them ...
         However, the fusion of the three forces was completely useless against sunguang.
         When he was dealing with a peak three-Sun Warrior, he had combined two forces and even used the blood Blade technique. In the end, they were barely on par. In fact, he was still a little weaker. If Hao lianchuan had not appeared, he might not have been able to take down Huang Jie.
         Thus, when he heard that Xuguang might be coming ... Li Hao was very nervous.
         Be careful!
         Can't afford to offend!
         Of course, what was there to be afraid of if he couldn't afford to offend them?
         I'm not afraid of Red moon's people. The main thing is that when Red moon's people encounter him, their first thought is to capture Li Hao alive. They don't have much killing intent, which is why Li Hao isn't too afraid. If it were flying sky or Yama's Xu Guang ... Li Hao would really be afraid of death.
         Majordomo Yu was just reminding him. Li Hao was not a child and had his own thoughts. Thus, she didn't say anything more and turned to leave.
         Li Hao considered it for a moment, then said,""Chief, if I want to bring my men to kill Ziyue ... What do you think?"
         Chief Steward Yu stopped in his tracks. He turned around and looked at Li Hao with cold eyes. "Don't try to test me again and again. I've been away from the red moon for many years. I'm not interested in your Affairs. When I left, the Crimson Moon was still a secret organization. As for the current Purple Moon ... I'm not familiar with them, and I haven't had any contact with the Black Spider for many years. Are you satisfied?"
         Li Hao hurriedly smiled."I'm satisfied. Please don't misunderstand, chief. I'm just afraid of hurting my family."
         After taking a few steps, Chief Steward Yu thought for a moment and turned back. He looked at Li Hao again."Also, it's best not to have such an idea! The current Ziyue is very likely Ying Hongyue's daughter ... I'm not sure about the details, but black spider's personality is a little special. It's very difficult for ordinary people to make her willing to give birth to a child ..."
         "Ying Hongyue's appetite is so good?"
         Li Hao was stunned.
         Chief Steward Yu suddenly laughed."Ying Hongyue ... He's also a very interesting person. You're not wrong to say that he has a good appetite. Your master just killed one of his sons not long ago. Ying Hongyue, on the other hand, has many children and grandchildren. He has at least 80 children and grandchildren if not 100 ... However, Ziyue may be quite valued, unlike the trash who was killed before."  A stallion!
         Li Hao took a deep breath. Only now did he know that Ying Hongyue actually had so many F * cking descendants.
         He had almost a hundred children, this ... If he had grandsons and great-grandsons, wouldn't he be able to create a huge organization with thousands of people?
         I'll go!
         He had always talked about Ying Hongyue, but only now did Li Hao know that she was actually an old pervert.
         "Understood!"
         Li Hao nodded, secretly happy.
         Ying Hongyue's daughter?
         It was even better!
         This way, it would feel better to threaten or kill.
         Ying Hongyue wouldn't necessarily care if her neglected children were killed, such as the early three yang realm cultivator her teacher killed. However, if she killed Ziyue, perhaps Ying Hongyue would fly into a rage.
         Chief Steward Yu frowned slightly, not knowing what Li Hao was thinking or what he had understood.
         I don't care about him!
         Soon, Chief Steward Yu disappeared from Li Hao's sight. She had only come to take the fiery phoenix spear.
         ……
         After a while.
         When Li Hao saw Liu Long and the others, he finally showed a cheerful smile.
         "Boss, sister Liu, brother Chao, brother Jian ..."
          With a smile on his face, Li Hao took the initiative to take a step forward and stretch out his arms ... Liu Long was still not used to it. Just as he was about to hug Li Hao, Li Hao walked around him and hugged Liu Yan. Liu Long was a little stunned.
         "Why are you suddenly so enthusiastic?" Liu Yan smiled charmingly.
         Li Hao withdrew his hand after a touch and laughed,""I haven't seen sister Liu for a long time. You've become even more beautiful! If I had known earlier, I would've gone to visit him a few days ago. Are you in a good mood now that you've met boss?"
         “……”
         Liu Yan rolled her eyes at him and ignored him.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Liu Long didn't reply. He glanced at Li Hao and said in a deep voice,""You've been cultivating for the past few days. Have you improved again?"
         "It's alright!"
         Li Hao chuckled."It's just so-so. He's just like this now. He might not even be as good as my teacher ..."
         What the hell is this?
         Liu Long was a little depressed. What do you mean by not necessarily as strong as your teacher?
        
         "When your teacher left, he killed the eyebrows-abrest stick, an existence comparable to a peak three-Sun Expert. You mean ... You also have a chance of killing a peak three-Sun Expert?
         "Boss, you're just in time. I have something to do. Let's go together."
         "What are you doing?"
         "I'm going to see Wang Henggang and ask him to send me some men. I'll see if there are any experts from the iron cloak clan who can join my team. I'll form a defense team with brother Jian and work with Black Phoenix ... Hehe, if even sunlight can't break through them, then even three suns will be dumbfounded!"
         "Wang Henggang?"
         "Are you close to him?" Liu Long frowned.
         "Not familiar, as long as you're familiar, boss."
         Speechless!
         Liu Long was indeed quite familiar with Wang Heng, who had just stayed in the Silver City for many years. However, Liu Long frowned and said,"Although I'm quite familiar with him, we had a falling out a few years ago. He insisted on leaving the Silver City, but I chose to return, so there was some unhappiness."
         "It's okay, it's better to squash enmity than keep it alive. Boss, does he have anyone under him?"
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "There is definitely one."
         Liu Long explained,"that guy is an expert in the iron cloak Dao. He has already broken through 100 perfection a few years ago. He is also a well-known Martial Master in the vicinity. When he left that year, he also took some martial Dao experts from the inspection Office with him. It is also because of this that the inspection Office has become weaker and weaker. Therefore, I am very dissatisfied with this guy ..."
         "Then let's go and meet him. By the way, he's now a late stage or even peak three yang expert. Boss, let's be polite."
         "What?"
         Liu Long was stunned for a moment before nodding his head and not saying anything else.
         Peak of the three suns?
         Wang Henggang?
         This improvement could be said to be rapid. However, thinking about it, he had become a super a long time ago, so he should be at the sunlit stage. It was normal for him to become a three sun after a few years. After all, the potential of a Martial Master was not weak.
         However, the peak of three suns was still beyond his expectations.
         "Sister Liu, you guys talk to the swords gate disciples first, I'll be back with boss!"
         "Alright!"
         ……
         Li Hao and Liu Long quickly left the Wei Wu Army. This time, they didn't walk. Li Hao asked for a car from Mu Lin. It was impossible for the Wei Wu Army to not have a car. Mu Lin was also very generous, so he lent his car to Li Hao.
         In the car.
          Liu Long Drove the car.  Liu Long didn't let Li Hao get over it.
         In fact, Li Hao felt that his boss was looking down on him. When he was driving for the first time, he couldn't control himself. Now that he was so powerful and it wasn't his first time driving, it was a bit inappropriate for his boss to look down on him.
         Liu Long ignored Li Hao and said while driving,""Wang Heng is a native of Silver City. He's not that old, about the same age as me. He was the director of the Patrol Division, and he actually did a good job. You also know how the Silver City was safe for a few years ... After he left, I set up the demon hunting squad. Before this, Wang Heng and I were in charge of Silver City. In fact, ordinary superpowers didn't dare to come and cause trouble. "
         "The two of us entered the night patrol together, but he successfully advanced, and I didn't ... After he advanced, he didn't want to leave Whitemoon city. My dissatisfaction with him was not because he didn't want to leave Whitemoon city, but because I suggested that we open a branch in Silver City. He would be the Minister, and we would help him. In that case, he was in riyao at the time, so there wouldn't be too much of a problem with him around."
         "Four years ago, the sun glory was still a supreme power in Silver Moon. There were not many of them in the Nightwalker system, but he was unwilling ..."
         Li Hao nodded and said,"everyone has their own ambitions. This is not important. He has manpower. He can just lend me some martial masters."
         Liu Long thought for a moment and nodded."If the old Martial Master was here, I might have recognized him. Back then, he took away more than ten tenth realm cultivators and one of them broke through the 100th realm. I don't know if he has advanced into a super or if he is still a Martial Master."
         Those people were the foundation of the Silver City's Inspection Office, but they were all taken away.
         Li Hao thought for a moment."Could it be that he knows something? for example, mu Sen is quite strong. Mu Sen went to the Silver City, so he thinks it's fine ..."
         He absolved Wang Henggang because Li Hao had seen him once.
         That black egg, he felt pretty good.
         Of course, one may know a person's face but not their heart.
         From Liu Long's point of view, the other party had taken away the powerhouses from the inspection Office and made the Silver City's defense appear to be at its weakest. This was actually very annoying.
          Liu Long wasn't so angry, he said softly,"It doesn't matter. Besides, the group of people he took away back then ... It seems like it was a good thing! Otherwise, if they all stayed in the Silver City, what would the Silver City have? After a few years, it was still the same, without any improvement. Wu Chao and the others followed me and didn't want to leave. Now you've seen it for yourself, if you didn't give them some support, they would still be at the level of ten severing States!"
         He sighed and shook his head."So, when he took them away, he might have given everyone a wider future. There's no blame. It's just that he felt a little uncomfortable."
         While they were talking, the car drove directly to the inspection Office of white moon City.
         It wasn't the inspection Office headquarters.
         White moon City also had a separate Inspection Office, but its presence was too weak, and ordinary people didn't even know that white moon City had a separate Inspection Office branch.
         ……
         White moon city's Inspection Office.
         Wang Heng was currently busy. With the large number of Scarlet Moon experts entering the Silver Moon, he, the chief of the White moon city's Inspection Office, was also very busy. He had to prevent the Scarlet Moon experts from attacking the White moon City.
         While he was busy, his communication device rang.
         He picked it up, and the voice of his subordinate came from the other end."Secretary, there are people downstairs who want to see you. It's a City Patrol and an investigator from the night patrols ..."
        
         Night patrolman?
         He was slightly stunned. He didn't have much to do with the night patrolman, so why would someone come to see him?
         A City Patrol was at least at the level of the sun glory.
         "What is it called?"
         "Surnamed Liu ... He said he's from the Silver City ..."
         In an instant, Wang Heng was in a daze as he thought of Liu Long, that stubborn guy.
         More than three years ago, he had chosen to come to white moon City, but that guy had stayed in Silver City.
         Three years ago, they had a good relationship.
         One was the head of the inspection Division, and the other was the captain of the law enforcement team. The entire Silver City was under their control, and the security in the Silver City was very good. They had cooperated for many years, and it had been very pleasant.
         But unfortunately ...
          "Let them come up ... Forget it, take them to the guest room. I'll go down." He sighed.
         "Secretary ..."
         "Let's do this!"
         Wang Heng stood up and hesitated for a moment, but he still went down.
         Liu Long came to find him?
         Was he fighting?
         Or was he cursing?
         Or was he looking for trouble?
         Or was he trying to persuade her to return to the Silver City?
         Anyway, this guy hadn't visited for a few years. Now that he had come today, he didn't seem to have good intentions.
         ……
         In the guest room.
         Li Hao's face was calm, but Liu Long was somewhat silent.
         "Boss, don't worry. If he's really unhappy, we'll beat him up and leave!"
         “……”
         Liu Long glanced at him and was somewhat speechless.
         This was the inspector's office of white moon City!
         You're here, beating up their chief?
         "Also, you already said that he's at the peak of three suns. You're very arrogant!
         Just as he was thinking, he heard footsteps.
         It was a little heavy.
         It was obviously done on purpose.
         A moment later, the door was pushed open.
         Black egg appeared.
         Wang Heng had just seen Li Hao, and only now did he know that the other person was Li Hao. He didn't say anything, but glanced at Liu Long and smiled.""Liu ... Long time no see."
         Liu Long glanced at him and nodded, "It's been a few years,"
         "Let's have a drink tonight?"
         "Forget it, I'm busy with official business."
         "Then ..."
         The two of them ignored Li Hao, but Li Hao didn't care.
         "You're welcome. There's no need to be so polite ... Do you know about the Wei Wu Army?"
         “……”
         "I know." Wang Henggang was speechless, but he still nodded.
         "The Wei Wu Army has just formed a 100-man team and is currently short of manpower. Do you have any suitable people here?"
         "There is."
         Wang Henggang nodded."You know all the old brothers from back then. Other than a few who have advanced to superpowers, they are all martial masters now. There are more than 170 of them, and there are still nine of them who have reached the tenth realm. Is that enough?" They're willing to go with you ... In fact, they've wanted to go back to find you these past few years, but I stopped them. I've told them that we'll only go back when we really need it. Now is not the time. It's too difficult for us to improve in the Silver City. "
         16 martial masters.
         There were a total of 7 people who had broken through 100 points, which was not a small number.  Obviously, he thought that Liu Long had joined the Wei Wu Army, and as a warrior master, he had to form a team.
         "It wasn't me, it was Li Hao!" Liu Long said with a frown.
         "What?"
         Wang Heng was stunned and looked at Li Hao. Li Hao was the centurion?
         "Li Hao.....Is a Qian Dou?"
         "Right!"
         ? Liu Long continued, and Li Hao also smiled,""I was just lucky ... That's why I knew that big brother Wang was from the Silver City, so I called big brother over to seek some support. I'm new here, and I'm not familiar with this place. I can only ask for big brother Wang's help."
         "Then, you ..."
         Wang Heng looked at Liu Long, who said calmly,""I'm Li Hao's assistant. Don't look at me like that, he's stronger than you! I've been your assistant for so many years, not to mention Li Hao. "You can ask your old brothers if they're willing to go and make it clear. It's more dangerous than what you're doing. If they're willing, then go. If they're not, then don't force them. It's a life-risking job, not a stroll."
         "You think they won't be willing?"
         Wang Heng just smiled, but he still frowned and said,""Li Hao is right here. It's not that I don't like him, but I think he's too young ..."
         Liu Long didn't stand on ceremony. He looked at Li Hao and said,""Give him a punch, let's see how much of tie Buyi's skill he still has!"
         Li Hao's face was full of joy.
         Wang Henggang smiled and nodded,"it's good to try!" To be honest, I'll be at ease if I hand him over to Liu Long, but if I hand him over to you ... I'm indeed a little uneasy. You should do your best ..."
         "Brother Wang, then you ... Defend with all your might!"
         "Of course!"
         Wang Henggang laughed."I know you're not weak, but ... I'm at the peak of three suns, do you know that?"
         Li Hao reminded him again."Really, brother Wang. You have to defend with all your strength. I'm very strong. I killed three suns before!"
         “……”
         Wang Henggang was stunned for a moment. His eyes flickered and he nodded.
         Kill Guo Sanyang?
         Yu Xiao?
         "Then I'll call?"
         "En!"
         In the next moment, Li Hao really held back his strength. He didn't use fire sword force, nor earth sword force, but the instant explosive power of metal sword force.
         BOOM!
         With a loud bang, this punch seemed to have hit steel.
         However, the instantaneous explosive power of the gold sword force was still powerful to the extreme!
         With a loud bang, Wang Heng flew away and directly hit a big hole in the wall.
         Li Hao shrugged his shoulders."I told you, you have to do your best."
         This punch was for boss.
         Sure enough, Liu Long revealed a smile at this moment, as if he was in a good mood. The entire Inspection Office also became chaotic. The next moment, Wang Heng shouted, "It's fine. It's just a friendly spar. Just do what you should do!"
         A moment later, Wang Heng returned. He looked at Li Hao and nodded."Not bad. You can take her with you. She has a bright future!"
         Then, he patted his chest as if he was patting dust.""I'm going to change my clothes. I think I've torn my clothes. It's not very elegant. I'll be back soon. Wait for me ..."
         With that, he turned around and left.
         After taking a few steps, his face suddenly turned ferocious, and he gritted his teeth. He breathed in, and his lungs hurt.
         His black face was full of ferocity, revealing a mask of pain!
          艹!
         This guy ... His punch was too damn vicious!
         He felt as if his bones had cracked, and judging by how his opponent had been so relaxed ... He probably hadn't even used his full strength.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It would not be his full strength.
         If he had really gone all out, it wouldn't have been like that.
         Wang Henggang's face was extremely ferocious. Someone happened to see it and revealed a puzzled expression. What was wrong with being the chief?
         Wang Henggang instantly regained his calm."Go and do your things ..."
         After saying that, he quickly disappeared.
         It hurt!
         Liu Long, that bastard, I was wondering why he was so easy to talk to this time. He deliberately set a trap for me!
        
         (The high-V member is giving out monthly votes. I'm watching everyone. Brothers, let's vote.)
         In the guest room.
         Li Hao laughed.
         He had encountered several experts who were good at defense.
         Mu Lin and Wang Henggang were the two strongest defensive experts he had met so far. They probably walked the same path as tie Buyi, but one was a super and the other was a Martial Master.
         Wang Henggang walked the path of superpowers. Li Hao sensed that he should be an earth-type, which was also considered to be compatible with martial arts.
         His strength was at the peak of the three suns, but he didn't know if he was considered strong among the peak of the three suns.
         Li Hao had met a few peak three suns experts.
         Zi Yue, the reincarnation King, Huang Jie, Wang Henggang ...
         However, these people's strength varied. Whether they had an original divine weapon or not was also a way to measure their strength. In addition, it also depended on whether they had converted from martial masters. For example, eyebrows-abrest rod and Hu dingfang, who were both at the late stage of three yang realm, were actually very powerful. Li Hao felt that they were both stronger than Huang Jie.
          As for Wang Henggang, who had been converted from a Martial Master, he might be even stronger. He was at the peak of three-yang.
         He was also the first Martial Master Li Hao had seen who had transformed into a peak three-Sun Warrior. As for the others, Purple Moon and the Samsara King were clearly not martial masters.
         Don't think that the previous punch was light and didn't use much strength.
         In fact, knowing that his opponent was a defensive type, Li Hao used his gold sword force, which was best at instant burst. This punch would definitely not be weak. In addition, Li Hao's strength had improved a bit, so even if it was not as powerful as the one he had used on hei Mulin, the difference was not too big.
         On that day, Mu Lin had been struck into the ground by his sword, and his body was covered in wounds.
         As for Wang Henggang, Li Hao estimated that his bone armor only had a few small cracks, which could be easily healed by experts like them. Of course, the pain was not small.
         Li Hao didn't use any convulsing force. He was just testing his skills, not to kill. Otherwise, his internal organs would be convulsed, and his injuries would be more serious.
         Liu Long laughed for a while before sighing,"This guy's strength has indeed improved very quickly. That's why he didn't go to the wrong place when he first came to the White moon City. Among the brothers who came with him, seven of them have broken through the 100-point barrier ..."
         Li Hao laughed,"boss, are there a lot?" On our side, we have three people who have broken through the 100-point mark. Including me, who's a warrior of the Qian dynasty, boss has also broken through to the Qian dynasty, and sister yunyao has entered the Dark Moon. We don't seem to be any worse than him, right?"
         Liu Long smiled,"that's now."
         It wasn't like this before.
         "It's almost the same. "
         Li Hao chuckled."This one is a little stronger than boss, but he's at the peak of three suns. One more step and he'll be at the rising light. It's very difficult ... But boss still has a lot of room for improvement. At the level of a warrior of Qian, there are many paths to take and many areas to be strong in."
         A powerful body, a powerful vitality, a powerful divine intent, and strengthening of the five internal organs ...
         At present, there were four ways to strengthen himself, and each method was being done by someone and had been successful.
         As for those at the peak of the three suns realm, they could only try to break the fifth superpower lock. Whether they could break it or not depended on their luck. If they could not find the superpower lock like Hao lianchuan, then they would have no way out.  Liu Long nodded and didn't continue on this topic. He opened his mouth and said,"I didn't expect there to be so many brothers who have been walking the path of martial arts. 16 of them ... At that time, this guy only took 20 people with him. In other words, no one has been sacrificed in the past few years ... He really has some means."
         At the mention of this, he felt sad again.
         Almost none of those who followed Wang Henggang died.
         However, a large number of those who followed him had died.
         Quite a few members of the demon hunting squad had died, and those people had chosen him, Liu Long, without any hesitation ...
         "The situation is different!"
         Li Hao said,"the inspection Office is only responsible for the public security of the city. This is white moon City, and there are countless experts. The main matters are done by the night patrol. In addition, the military is here. Who dares to cause trouble in white moon City?" It's just some daily missions, so the losses won't be too big. Boss, the situation is different. "
         "Yes."
         Even though he knew that Li Hao was just comforting him, Liu Long still quickly adjusted his state of mind.
         His mentality had always been okay.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, today, he had come here and met his old friend who had a disagreement with him. The other party was strong, and most of the brothers he brought out were safe and sound. On the other hand, he was weak, and more than half of the brothers he brought out were dead or injured ... Naturally, there was a gap between them.
         Li Hao didn't try to persuade him anymore.
         He thought for a moment and calculated.
         There were 30 people in swords gate, and if 16 of them were willing to go, then there would be 46 of them.
         In addition to Liu Long, Liu Yan, Wu Chao, and Chen Jian, excluding himself, there were exactly 50 people.
          The 100-man team had just completed half of the mission.
         This did not include Jin gun's promise to recruit 37 people from the Wei Wu Army. If they were to include them, 87 people would be a very small number.
         However, Li Hao didn't plan on recruiting the Wei Wu Army for the time being.
         If you were to transfer someone who was training well, it would only make them unhappy.
         50 people were actually enough.
         In addition to his 51 people and the two from douqian, there were 20 people who had broken through 100 and 29 people who had killed Ten Realms.
         The percentage of breaking through 100 wasn't low. Of course, compared to the other 100-man teams, the percentage of this tenth realm was still very high. However, he had the black armor, and when the tenth realm expert wore it, it would also have a strong defense.
         By the way, can the black Phoenix be opened?
         It should be possible. Maybe it was hou Xiaochen's doing. Li Hao had cut it once before, but it was still very difficult to cut it open. Only the starry sky sword was powerful.
         "If all 29 tenth severing cultivators can break through 100 ... Breaking through 100 in the tenth severing realm only depends on the strength of inner strength, not momentum. Blood God, sword energy, divine energy stone, and attribute-less mysterious energy are all methods to increase the strength of the tenth severing realm, and they are extremely effective!"
        
         At this moment, Li Hao's first thought was to make the entire team break through the 100-level barrier.
         With the addition of Black Phoenix, they were a powerful team.
         There was no need to worry about fighting sunlight at all. If two or three martial masters with a cultivation level above 100 joined forces, they could definitely kill him ... The premise was that their speed could keep up. These martial masters with a cultivation level above 100 were actually still a little lacking, and their speed might not be able to catch up.
         Many thoughts appeared in his mind.
         At this moment, Wang Heng walked in. He had changed into a new set of clothes and a smile appeared on his face. With a wave of his hand, the wall that had just been damaged was instantly sealed up.
         The earth element was terrifying!
         First-class house-building!
         Only now did Wang Heng have the mood to carefully size Li Hao up, and he sighed with emotion."As expected, heroes come from the young! With your power......In the Wei Wu Army, the only one who can defeat you is Jin gun. "
         Sighing with emotion, he also sat down and looked at Liu Long,"Why did you decide to come to Whitemoon city this time? You didn't want to when I called you, but now you're willing when Li Hao calls you?"
          Liu Long sneered,"did you have the same timing as now?" At that time, there were supers wreaking havoc everywhere, but now, many supers had been killed and the four organizations were exterminating them. Lone supers avoided them like the plague, so would they dare to cause trouble? However, a few years ago, those lone superpowers were unscrupulous and went around killing people. If they left at that time, Silver City would have been destroyed!"
         "Old Liu, I understand what you're saying. But mu Sen, you know, he's not weak ... With him around, the Silver City's safety is actually guaranteed."
         "Director mu hid it too well," Li Hao added."I usually can't tell."
         Wang Heng thought for a moment and nodded. That was true.
         That fatty was as shameless as his brother.
         He and Mu Lin also knew each other and had even dealt with each other before. They were both from the same line of tie Buyi and the two of them had even sparred before. Wang Heng had just won slightly, but not by much. Mu Lin was also extremely strong.
         Wang Henggang didn't dwell on what happened in the past. Now, there were advantages and disadvantages to both sides. There was no right or wrong, and he didn't feel that he had done anything wrong.
         "Old Liu, I'll get someone to report to the Wei Wu Army tomorrow. Once they know that you're here, no one will reject you."
         After saying that, Wang Heng looked at Li Hao and said,""We're all old brothers from the silver Blizzard city. Li Hao, to be more realistic, these days, people from your hometown are more reliable than outsiders, so you have to take care of them. I know a thing or two about the situation in the Wei Wu Army. It's still very dangerous, much more dangerous than in the inspection Office, but those old brothers, some of them are not young anymore. If we don't take a gamble ... We won't have another chance. "
         "Actually, when the Wei Wu Army went to the front stage, I had already considered letting them join. Now that you and old Liu can gain a firm foothold in the Wei Wu Army, it's better than I expected."
         This was one of the reasons why he agreed so readily.
         In fact, when the Wei Wu Army went to the front stage, he had already considered this. He wanted those people to develop in the Wei Wu Army. Now, other than the Wei Wu Army, the other fields were mainly focused on supers.
         Martial masters were not very popular.
         In fact, he had discussed this with those people long ago, so he didn't ask at all. He knew that it wasn't a big problem. Now, it was more in line with his wishes. Even if Li Hao wasn't familiar with them, how could Liu Long not be?  Liu Yan and the others had been with him back then. Most of the people he had taken away were from the law enforcement team.
         It could be said that Li Hao's arrival was a hit-off!
         "Then let's do this!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Liu Long stood up and was about to leave. Since they had come to an agreement, he was too lazy to say anything more to Wang Heng gang.
         Wang Henggang stretched out his hand to stop him,"Why are you in such a hurry? It's been a few years since we've met, old friend. Stay for a meal. "
         "I'm not too happy to eat with you!"
         “……”
         Wang Heng chuckled and glanced at Li Hao. Li Hao shrugged."Don't look at me. Boss has the final say."
         Wang Henggang laughed."Let's have a meal. After we are done, we will go to the Wei Wu Army tomorrow. I will ask them to bring you some good stuff."
         "What?"
         "The Super network!"
         Wang Henggang explained,"in the past few years, it's not that the inspection Office has been stagnant. It's not that they haven't made any progress. Other than martial masters and superpowers, they have also made some special weapons. The rest is just so-so, but there's a super network that's very powerful!"
          "It's from the central continent. Even ordinary people can use it. It's a big net with some ice crystals mixed in. It's a rare weapon made with ice crystals and other special items. As long as the net can trap the enemy, even sunlight won't be able to stop it. Not only will it suppress the enemy's strength, but it will also greatly interfere with the mysterious energy ..."
         "Why isn't there any in Silver City?" Liu Long raised his brows.
         "There are very few of them, and the night patrolmen took some. The inspection Office only has three nets left, and I will have someone bring one over tomorrow. The method of making it is not ordinary, so there is no way to imitate it. "
         Li Hao was also somewhat interested. He said,""It can only deal with sunlight?"
         "Yes, at the stage of the three yang ... It's too difficult to deal with!"
         Wang Henggang shook his head and said,"to be able to create such an extraordinary item to control the sunlight in 20 years ... It's actually very fast progress. At least for the middle and lower classes, the sunlight is the peak. The three suns rarely appear in front of the public. This net is enough."
         It was just that the number was too small.
         Over at the central region, more than 10 cards were distributed. The inspection Office took some, and the night patrolmen also took some. He was able to get three cards because the White moon city's Inspection Office was the one doing the work.
         After thinking for a while, Liu Long nodded,"let's have a meal then!"
