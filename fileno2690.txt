……At this moment, the shadow was watching silently.One of them was at the fifth step, while the other was at the third step. Under normal circumstances, they would have had a chance of passing the 1000 squares.If there was no hope, it would be difficult.However, this place wasn't meant to make things difficult for anyone. Although the secret envoy was a master of the dark system, it didn't mean that his heart was really dark. He just felt that Dharma couldn't be passed on easily, so he left this place of Taoist connotation as a test.After clearing the first stage, the second stage should be able to be cleared under normal circumstances ... Provided that one wasn't truly trash.If he was really a good-for-nothing ... Then it was fine if he couldn't pass.At this moment, looking at the situation of the two of them, they should have hope of passing.The shadow looked at Sui han and frowned.This person was too anxious.It was not a good thing to be so brutal. Under normal circumstances, he was a fifth rank venerable sovereign. He had some understanding of the great Dao. Even if he was mainly a dark-type, it did not mean that he did not know other things.Some squares didn't need to be barged in. They could be cleared by using various Dao forces to balance, counter, and generate each other.

Was not a good thing for the strong.As a traveler in the dark, he had to be even more careful. Even at the 8th rank, the shadow Messenger was still a cautious person."This person ... Is too anxious. It might have something to do with the psychological pressure from the destruction of The Dark World."The mysterious man judged for a moment, then looked at Li Hao. Li Hao's performance was quite average. It couldn't be said that his performance was very bad, but it wasn't to the extent that ... He was outstanding. As for the fire element, he had passed the test instantly because he had definitely received the inheritance of some powerful expert.What the shadow saw were the auras of the fire, water, and physical messengers. For Li Hao, the comprehension of level six and Level Seven allowed him to pass the barrier of the water and fire physical body easily!At the same time, it was easy for Xi han to pass the dark element.However, the game of Go wasn't just for you to pass the test.He then looked at Pi han. Pi han seemed to have discovered something. At this moment, he started to pass the levels. The levels he passed were all related to the dark element. They were very easy, such as darkness, darkness, invisibility, shield, breath control ...These obstacles were easy for dark-type powerhouses.The shadow frowned slightly. The game of chess was actually a treasure. For many venerable sovereigns, it was a Supreme treasure. Passing the test was secondary. The key was to gain something from the game.Just as Li Hao had thought, this move was definitely not simple.Dao chess was indeed refined from a major world.It was not the Dao universe that Li Hao had imagined, but a great world and a Dao universe that had been refined.The master of the Dao chess game was not the secret agent, but the master of tianfang.In the past, the master of Tian Fang wasn't born as a level nine. He had enemies and enemies. He had once killed a level eight venerable sovereign and refined the great world and great path universe that he was in into a chess piece. That was how this treasure came about. Later on, Tian Fang master left this item here with the intention of helping the secret envoy to comprehend the Dao. It was useful even to a level eight venerable sovereign, so one could imagine how powerful this treasure was.However, the two of them were not using real chess pieces.However, even if it wasn't a real chess move, these two people weren't eighth-rank secret agents, so they were still of great help.……At this moment, Li Hao didn't deliberately avoid the great Dao systems that he was unfamiliar with.He was not familiar with some of the great Dao systems, but he was willing to go in and take a look.He didn't walk in a straight line, but rather, he walked around the area.Li Hao didn't continue after he finished walking. He sat cross-legged, looked around, and fell into deep thought.As a ruler of a Dao universe and a cultivator who had refined the river of chaos and even weaved it himself, Li Hao actually had some understanding of the myriad DAOs.Soon, he had some conclusions.These grids were filled with all kinds of power of Taoist connotation, which were not randomly distributed.It was ... In an orderly manner!Chaos was originally without order.The great Dao was also without order.What cultivators had to do was to transform the disorderly Dao into the orderly Dao, interweave it, and then rebuild the long river of Dao. However, the rejection and co-existence of Dao were actually an unimaginably large project.You need to have a certain level of understanding of the ten thousand DAOs.However, among all the cultivators in the world, who would dare to say that I have some understanding of the myriad DAOs?Perhaps ... The master of tianfang could.,m Perhaps, the expert who made this go could.Li Hao's expression changed slightly. He looked around again. This chess piece wasn't refined according to the path of order, was it?If that was the case ... The person who made this chess piece was simply unimaginable!"Mutual promotion and restraint, mutual rejection, and fusion. The Dao of the two extremes ..."Li Hao suddenly floated into the air. He wanted to see more. He wanted to see if there were any conflicts in the Taoist connotation on the chessboard.If not ... That would be too terrifying.There was a high probability that this move was not secretly played.The secret agent could only walk 8000 steps, so the other party couldn't make this thing. This thing was very likely to belong to the master of Tian Fang.After watching for a while, Li Hao's heart moved.The next moment, he suddenly gritted his teeth. Li Hao's original body, which was still outside, suddenly jumped and entered the path chess. One could also enter the path chess directly.

Chapter 2691 The Chessboard Of The Great Dao (1)_6
He jumped into the chess piece, and the river of life and death appeared.In the next moment, stars appeared in the starry sky of the river of life and death.Exactly 360 crystals!The life and death Stars were in the center, which was where Li Hao was in the chess board. The next moment, he rearranged the stars according to the arrangement of the chess board.……Outside, the mysterious man's eyes moved.The Dao River!Imitating the arrangement of the chess board, with the life and death Stars as the main, the life and death Dao cultivator.Had he finally discovered it?The mysterious man smiled. This was normal. In fact, Li Hao wasn't the first person to discover it. It was just that ... Li Hao had to figure out how far he could go, how many arrangements he could make, and how many he could see.Only when you leave can you find out what Dao is in the next grid.This chess piece could be said to be the inheritance of the master of tianfang's entire life ... It was a little serious, but it was definitely a manifestation of the other party's comprehension of the great Dao. Dao chess was an opportunity!After passing the first stage, the second stage was actually an opportunity.Let's see if you can catch it! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Then, Thearch drought ...At this moment, the illusory figure took a look and frowned slightly. This person wanted to cultivate the Dao of darkness, to strengthen the Dao of darkness, but he actually had an opportunity. As long as he could arrange all the orthodoxies related to the Dao of darkness according to the chessboard and complete them all into one, this drought would be his opportunity!He didn't need to comprehend the secret envoy's Taoist connotation. The secret envoy's Taoist connotation was his own.Everyone's Dao was different.Otherwise, if he really passed 1000 squares and comprehended the hidden Taoist connotation of the secret agent, it might not be as much as the gains from the Dao chess.On the contrary, there were some limitations. The Dao you secretly used didn't mean you could copy it.Only by understanding the core essence could he do so.As for Dao chess, it was a kind of arrangement that was orderly and disorderly. In this vast world, perhaps only the master of Tian Fang had the ability to do this. It was really like throwing away a watermelon to pick up a sesame seed!……Li Hao's eyes were bright.He might as well enter with his true body, transform into the river of life and death, and rearrange the order.Arrangement ... This was something that many people had mentioned before.The Supreme of neo martial arts was mentioned in the educational records.The younger sister of the neo martial King had once left behind a book called "Yuan Ping's Chronicles" and had also used this method.The source of these techniques actually came from Zhan Tiandi. Zhan Tiandi was the first one to explain the essence of the great Dao in the yin-yang world. In essence, it was the order of the ten thousand DAOs.Li Hao had never read Zhan Tiandi's book, but neo martial was influenced by Zhan Tiandi, and silver Moon was influenced by neo martial. Even though they were separated by an era, he had also sensed many things.The order and disorder of the 10000 DAOs could also be considered a kind of arrangement.Zhan Tiandi's technique, Zhan Tiandi's Dao ... If one were to say the core, it might also be the order.And from this move, Li Hao once again sensed the common nature of top-tier experts!The order of 10000 DAOs!Furthermore, the sword saint's unification of all DAOs and the integration of the longevity sword will were also a type of arrangement of DAOs.All of this proved that this path was actually very crucial and very long-term.The stronger one was, the clearer one could sense it.Neo martial's Supreme martial artists, human King, and sword venerable were all using this method.But today, in the tianfang world, in the Taoist connotation of a level eight venerable sovereign, on the chessboard that might have been created by the master of tianfang, Li Hao experienced this method again. This was a form of affirmation for Li Hao.It was an affirmation of neo martial and Zhan Tiandi because ninth-stage venerable sovereigns were also explaining the great Dao to people in this way.Meanwhile, on Silver moon's side, Li Hao had actually been trying this method all this time.The combination of Holy prose, the combination of rivers, the river of chaos, the river of life and death, the river of time ... In fact, he had been trying to use these combination methods, fusion methods, and sorting methods to do all these.Thus, the river of life and death, the Bridge of Life and death, the combination of life and death ..."Interesting!""The opportunity has come!" Li Hao was a little happy and began to enter the next grid. Even though the Dao power in some grids made him uncomfortable and consumed a lot of his energy, Li Hao didn't leave. Instead, he continued to study.He wanted to know how to calm down the Taoist connotation. This matter would be very helpful for the future and help him stabilize the river!Be it the river of time or the river of life and death, they all needed to be stabilized.The turbulent River was clearly not safe.As a result, Li Hao's speed was reduced.In half a day, Li Hao had passed 50 squares.As for master tuo han, he had already passed the 200th square. With his powerful Dao power, he charged forward. The more he fought, the more courageous he became. He easily broke through the 200th square.In the sky, the shadow observed the two of them.Li Hao's path was quite correct.It wasn't that the drought was wrong, but ...The illusory figure thought to himself,'it's not a problem for Xi han to break through the Dao with force.'However, if he wanted to spread the Dao of darkness ... Forget it!Wash up and go to sleep!"You're only at the fifth rank, not the ninth. If you were at the ninth rank, you could just charge through and pass the level directly. You're right, but you're not. In the eyes of the shadow, you're a little useless.The mysterious man looked at Li Hao again. Although he was walking slowly, chess didn't look at time.It didn't matter how slow he was.It all depended on whether this person could pass the 1000 squares if he followed his thoughts.……Time slowly passed.Li Hao, on the other hand, was walking slower and slower.Li Hao had only walked 100 steps when Li Hao, who was next door, had walked 500 steps. The gap between them was getting bigger and bigger.Li Hao didn't care about that. He was even more excited now.Above the river of life and death, in the sky, there was a huge change in the arrangement of the stars. It seemed to be more in sync than before. Among them, there were some slight changes to the 100 stars.In the river, second cat looked up for a while, then looked at Li Hao, wagged its tail, and went back to sleep.The corner of his mouth, however, was slightly raised.He seemed to see a teacher here!This kind of method, this kind of method, was what teachers were best at.It remembered clearly that teachers loved to play this kind of game. They would arrange things in a disorderly way to form a variety of fun things.This is interesting!Today, this annoying brat seems to be walking down this path as well. Ermao only feels that it's very familiar. As for disturbing the river and causing it to shake ... I won't bother with him.

2692 Chapter 447
What was the great Dao?Li Hao couldn't explain it clearly, and neither could the others.Was it a kind of enlightenment?Was it a way of using energy?Was it a kind of cognition?No one could tell the specifics. Everyone's understanding of Dao was different. In Li Hao's eyes, Dao was a way of using power, a way of using one's own perception and abilities.This method could be divided into life and death, yin and yang, time and all kinds of DAOs.This process involved the understanding of energy and heaven and earth. It was Dao enlightenment.How to use the limited energy to the extreme.This was a type of Dao, but not all.It was like a chemical reaction. One kind of great Dao, which was usually unremarkable, might be able to erupt with unimaginable energy when combined with another great Dao. This was the improvement and fusion of a kind of Dao.In Li Hao's opinion, the level of Dao was an improvement in his understanding of the world.It was just like a chemical reaction. If you did it right and the chemical formula was right, you could complete the improvement and the experiment. But if you did the chemical formula wrong ... Then you could not improve.This was the realm.Perhaps, it could be completed in one try and could be upgraded."Perhaps, you'll still fail even after thousands of times. This means that you're unfamiliar with this chemical reaction. If you can't complete the transformation, you'll have to start all over again.This was Li Hao's self-acknowledged Dao.As for the others, they might not be the same as what he knew.The purpose of giving a lecture was just to explain some of one's own ideas. As for whether other people agreed with it or not, it was their own business. Of course, the great Dao was the same. For example, chemical equations might be the only one.This was the common point of Dao!However, the process might be completely different.Li Hao had always been like this. He only listened to different processes to see if he could get the same result. This was what he learned from listening to Dao.But today, the great path chessboard provided Li Hao with a huge chemical reaction equation that eventually gave him the result of a great path.He might not be the only one!However, for Li Hao, he had never heard of or seen this chemical reaction before. At this moment, he was checking the chemical reaction step by step to see if it could be used for his own use.Be it "Yuan Ping's Chronicles" or "Zhang family educational records," they were all basic chemical equations, but they were very basic. The DAOs in them were actually provided to powerhouses who had not become emperors. It was equivalent to a basic chemical equation. At this moment, Li Hao was a high school student. Although he could still use it, he was not up to date with the times.Now, he was looking at a high-level chemical equation from a University Chemistry major, an extremely long chemical equation ... In fact, he couldn't verify all of it, but it could open up his field of vision and increase his knowledge. This was the Dao!The result of this chemical equation was actually thousands of DAOs as one, a true unity.And all the experts were pursuing this unity.Li Hao was like this, the human King was like this, the sword venerable was like this, the Supreme was like this ... Be it the book of the great Dao, the inner world, or the longevity sword, everyone was actually pursuing the same result, the unity of Dao!The great path chessboard was the result of the great path merging into one.Of course, this was actually the simplest high-level chemical equation. Li Hao couldn't understand anything more complicated. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He didn't need to be too unfathomable. Everything in front of him was enough.Li Hao was hungry and thirsty. He wished he could instantly go through all 9999 squares.However, he knew that his knowledge was still shallow. Even if he was a third level venerable sovereign, it was still not enough.He needed to comprehend, try, and experiment bit by bit. He couldn't look at it directly, or he wouldn't be able to understand it. He had to follow the chemical equation step by step and then remember every step.When he became more skilled, he might not need to do this. But obviously, he could not do it now.Therefore, Li Hao didn't even look at Xi han, who was crazily passing the test. He wasn't in a hurry at all. He tried, merged, and arranged the levels bit by bit, doing what he should do.As for the result, it didn't matter.As long as he remembered this, entering the dark Demon Ridge this time would be his greatest success.However, Li Hao had also encountered some difficulties.He hadn't comprehended the Dao of this stage. He hadn't integrated it into the river. He hadn't even come into contact with it.Therefore, he was stuck at this step.What Dao was this?Li Hao couldn't explain it. It was just like when he encountered an element he didn't know during an experiment, and he couldn't provide it. The experiment suddenly came to a halt at this stage!"Splitting or duplication? Or a mirror? Or a projection? A rebound?"In this square, an identical Li Hao appeared and kept attacking Li Hao.However, Li Hao was unable to determine what Dao it was.It was possible for him to split and copy the mirror, but ... He had never comprehended any of these, so he was somewhat ignorant.Li Hao kept frowning.After a long time, he decided to force his way through. First, he would remember this level, remember this Dao that he didn't know, remember this element and chemical that he didn't know. After this stage, he would look for it and try again.It would not affect the subsequent experiment reaction.He was helpless. He would definitely encounter many similar DAOs in these 9999 squares. He could only remember them one by one. It was impossible for him to master all of them.

2693 Chapter 447
Li Hao noted this down. Soon, he used brute force to defeat the clone-like existence and entered the next square.This was also the first time Li Hao had managed to defeat it.At this stage, he had almost no energy consumption.At this moment, Li Hao had only passed over a hundred squares, while Xi han, who was next to him, had already lit up over seven hundred squares.On the other side, mi han, who was madly charging forward, also stopped for a moment. He looked at the other side with a cold look in his eyes. Venerable sovereign Hao Yue didn't seem to be doing well.He had walked more than 700 squares while the other party had walked more than 100 squares. He was five times faster than him.,m This meant that this guy was most likely only a third level venerable sovereign, and not the middle level venerable sovereign that he had expected.If that was the case ... No matter how the other venerable sovereigns in the dark World died, he would have to bear the consequences!The corners of tuo Han's mouth curled up into a cold smile.Dao chess was a test of one's comprehension of the great Dao. However, it was also a test of one's strength. As a fifth level venerable sovereign, he had a strong Dao accumulation. Even if he were to charge recklessly, he would be able to pass more than seven hundred squares.He wasn't far from a thousand.After a thousand, he might try two thousand, three thousand ... Of course, he could forget about doing more. At this moment, he was also a little tired.……The mysterious man who had been watching them all this time sighed in his heart.Force their way in!He didn't gain anything from this drought.It was fine if he didn't gain anything, but he even left a lot of injuries of the great Dao for himself. What was he after?I'm asking you to play chess, not to force it!"Given your situation, you won't be able to gain much insight even if you were given the usual insight of a spy. You're a fifth rank venerable sovereign, after all. The Dark World is also a macro world. Why do I feel that this fifth rank venerable sovereign is not as good as some ordinary low-level venerable sovereigns?"It was a waste of time!At this moment, the mysterious man no longer cared about him. Instead, he focused on Li Hao. Up until now, he had only been unable to comprehend one square. It was already very impressive that the person in front of him was only a third level venerable sovereign.From the looks of it, his own comprehension of the Dao was quite deep. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 However ... The other party was still at the 3rd rank.He didn't see any improvement in his comprehension of his realm, or his strength. Even though Li Hao kept learning and changing, he still didn't see anything like that.The mysterious man observed for a while and came to a conclusion."Interesting ... Cognitive impairment?""This is ..." The mysterious man mumbled. Perhaps it wasn't a cognitive block, but rather a person with some thoughts and ideas. He felt that he needed to comprehend another powerful Dao and fuse it together, transcending life and death, before he could advance?Why would he have such an idea?Under normal circumstances, any Dao could lead one straight to grade-9!Life and death was not considered a weak Dao.It wasn't impossible for him to reach grade-9 directly.However, Li Hao seemed to have developed a cognitive barrier. The mysterious man could sense that this person seemed to want to advance through other means and make his Dao more perfect. "He left some blank space ... He didn't fill in other DAOs, but left them for other DAOs ...""It seems like ... There's already a conclusion to his Dao fruit?"The mysterious man felt strange.Perhaps it was a little strange!This person seemed to have an expectation of his Dao fruit's final result and the conclusion of his great Dao. It wasn't the kind that could be improved at will. He needed to fill in some of the gaps now and then complete the great Dao.What Dao was more worth looking forward to than the Dao of life and death?If not for that, this person would have gained a lot from the chessboard of the great path this time. It wouldn't be difficult to reach the fourth rank.However, Li Hao still showed no signs of advancing.In other words, no matter how much this guy comprehended, he was actually unable to advance to Tier 4.It was really strange!The path of life and death was really not bad.Even the tianfang master, who had walked the Dao of space and was the Dao master of the Dao of space, did not dare to say that he could look down on the life and death Dao master.It was still not certain who would win if they met at the same level."What is he trying to comprehend?"This was The Phantom's biggest doubt at the moment.……Li Hao was looking forward to it.What was he expecting?Looking forward to yin and yang!Yes, in his plan, the next step should be to comprehend yin and yang.Life and death, yin and yang, universe!This was Li Hao's plan for himself. He would learn about life and death at level three, yin and yang at level six, and the universe at level nine. The universe was space, or perhaps time.Time and space!During this process, he would integrate 10000 DAOs and perfect his three main DAOs. Then, he would finally gather the great DAOs and become the time Dao master. Only then would he be the true master of time, the path master of time!Be it life or death, yin and yang, destruction or revival ... In Li Hao's eyes, none of them could compare to time.Time was a cultivator's life goal.The pursuit of immortality, the pursuit of eternal appearance, the pursuit of everlasting time ...He only has his own Dao heart and perseverance. I have to perfect the other DAOs before I can continue. Otherwise, I'll reach the fourth step and miss the opportunity to transform. I might not be able to complete the fusion of the great DAOs and walk on the true Dao of time.At that moment, he had absorbed the power of many great DAOs from the boxes. He didn't use them for comprehension. Instead, he used them to build the bridge between life and death.Previously, he had absorbed too much power of darkness, and he did not dare to absorb any more.At this moment, Li Hao began to absorb the power of other great DAOs and continued to perfect his Bridge of Life and death. At this stage, Li Hao had his own ideas and persistence, although he admired and envied the expert who made the Dao chess.

However, it didn't mean that he would walk the same path as the other party.If this master was the master of Tian Fang, Li Hao could learn from him, imitate him, and worship him, but he could not become him.He had his own ultimate goal.Therefore, in the eyes of the shadow, Li Hao's level did not increase. He only remembered the order of the DAOs and understood them, but did not absorb the truth of the great DAOs.He had used this energy to build a bridge between life and death ... It was an absolute waste.If it was another third stage venerable sovereign, he might have advanced to the fourth stage by now.Li Hao, on the other hand, was minding his own business and completing his own plan.The Bridge of Life and death continued to increase.At this moment, the number had increased from 280 to 290, with an average of 20 squares, which could almost add a bridge.He was still 70 bridges away from the peak of stage three.At this rate, and with the difficulty of advancing further, Li Hao would probably need to cross 2000 cells before he could advance to the perfected stage of stage three."Yin and yang ... I haven't met them yet."At this moment, Li Hao was not disappointed, because he had met the light!Bai Zhi's Dao of light was different from the light he imagined and the light he knew.That extreme light, that feeling of brightness, that feeling of gentleness, it made him somewhat lost.Was this the power of light?He was very familiar with aunty light's light sword, but it did not give him such a feeling. Aunty light's sword was sharp, but the light here was not as sharp.There was only a kind of gentleness, a kind of brightness, a kind of Majesty ..."This is the light?""Or rather, light is actually different. There are many types ... You can see light in the dark ..."Li Hao murmured. This was different from what he knew. At this moment, he was also constantly absorbing these insights. He had more insights now. In the future, when he returned to the Silver Moon world, he would integrate what he saw and heard today into the great Dao universe. At that time, all the people of the Silver Moon could go to the great Dao to gain insights ... Even if they did not learn it, they could use it as a reference. These were the insights of the great Dao left behind by a top-notch venerable sovereign.It didn't matter if Li Hao didn't learn it, but if others did, they would at least make some progress."Nirvana and revival, are there any of these?"Li Hao's mouth was dry. It was a pity that Kong Ji didn't come here and didn't play chess. Otherwise, Kong Ji would have some understanding of the Dao of recovery. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He continued to comprehend and ignore everything else.Beside him, GUI han was panting heavily. Cracks could be seen on his body, but he was still grinning.900 cells!He was only 100 squares away from success.Li Hao, on the other hand, had walked about 200 squares. The gap between them was too big.I'm about to succeed!  He was overjoyed.The next moment, he didn't care about recovering and continued to break into the next grid. A violent movement broke out in the grid. The power of a rank five venerable sovereign was also revealed at this moment. The powerful Taoist connotation in the 901 grids was directly broken by him!In an instant, Xi han entered the next Dao grid. He was getting closer and closer to success.……Three days had passed.In addition to the few days they had spent outside and the time they had spent in the first trial, it had been almost half a month since Li Hao's group had entered this place.At this moment, Li Hao had passed nearly 300 squares.His speed did not slow down, and he was moving forward at a speed of 100 squares a day.He wasn't in a hurry, nor was he in a hurry.He didn't slow down, and of course, he didn't accelerate either.On the other hand, Pi Han's speed had slowed down. On the first day, he had cleared 700 squares, and on the second day, he had cleared more than 900 squares.By the end of the third day, he had reached more than 980 squares.He had only walked around 60 squares that day.The gap from 1000 squares was very small.Mi han was excited, but he was also exhausted. There were many wounds of the great Dao on his Dao marks, but he was not worried. The wounds of the great Dao were troublesome, but as long as he understood the hidden Taoist connotation of the secret envoy, he could enter the sixth level smoothly. The wounds of the great Dao would recover instantly.This was his plan.Actually, there was nothing wrong with it.These Dao injuries were not enough to seriously injure him. It was just a little troublesome. Once he had successfully advanced, it would not be a problem anymore.At this moment, he still chose to stop for a while, rest and recover.He turned his head and looked next door. Li Hao wasn't too slow. He had also reached the 300th square, which was better than he had expected. He had thought that Li Hao might not be able to move any further.In the end, it was not bad to reach the 300th square.Li Hao's aura seemed to be a little stronger than before ... But in Sui Han's eyes, this little improvement was insignificant.In his opinion, Supreme Emperor Hao Yue was too narrow-minded.In order to absorb the energy from those daogies, he had actually wasted so much time. After all, this place might close at any time, and if he didn't try to quickly complete the task and instead absorbed that insignificant energy bit by bit, so what if he reached the peak of the 3rd rank?He raised his head and looked at the shadow.The illusory figure had not spoken a single word in the past few days. It was extremely quiet.As if he saw Chuhan looking at him, the virtual shadow suddenly said,""My friend from the darkest world, your injury is not light. While you are still in the Taoist chess game, you can take a break and absorb some Taoist power. It can still heal your injury."Mi han smiled."There's no need. I'm close to 1000 squares. Today, I'll finish this level!"Stop at this time?

Am I sick?"Senior, does the secret envoy's Taoist connotation ... Really still exist?""It exists." "It's not as good as before, but it's enough for you,"the mysterious man said softly.That's good.Of course, if the shadow went back on his word, it would be troublesome.Sui han thought to himself and turned his head to look at Li Hao. That guy has been stuck at the 300th square for a long time. I don't care about him. I'll finish the mission first. If possible, I want to finish 2000 squares!Therefore, he asked again,"senior, if I complete 1000 squares, can I first comprehend the Taoist connotation, and then ... Continue to play Go?"Separate and you want a reward!The mysterious man thought for a while, and then nodded,""Yes! However ... Even if you have passed the 1000th grid, your Dao injury is not light. Comprehending the Taoist connotation of a strong person will actually aggravate your Dao injury. If you can't advance, I advise you to stop. ""Many thanks for senior's reminder!"Mi han smiled and thanked the mysterious man for his reminder. He did not accept the mysterious man's suggestion.We'll talk about it when the time comes.If I can pass the 2000th square, I'll ask for the same conditions as Supreme Emperor Hao Yue. I'd like to try my domain and sealing the world.The mysterious man didn't say anything.He was too lazy to care.Let's see!If you can't advance and you can finish 2000 squares, I'm blind.The mysterious man looked at Li Hao again. This time, Li Hao seemed to have stayed there for a long time. The mysterious man actually knew what the Tao in the box was. It was just a very simple comprehension of sword principle. He didn't know why he had stayed there for so long.This person was also good at the sword path, so logically speaking, he should have been able to pass in an instant.Why did he stop until now?……At this moment, Li Hao was looking at his sword.Ten thousand swords appeared, their destructive power shocking.Li Hao only dodged. He didn't destroy, block, or defeat them. He just watched in silence.There seemed to be some curiosity and some strangeness in his eyes.A sword! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He had started using the sword a long time ago. He had learned a lot of sword techniques, including the extremely powerful longevity sword intent. But at this moment ... Li Hao had been stuck at this stage, because he had seen a different sword.An extremely pure sword!Be it longevity sword or other sword principles, they all seemed to have attributes, personal characteristics, and some uniqueness. But this time, he saw an extremely pure sword!It was only a sword!It was not mixed with anything else but the foundation of the sword Dao, the most basic sharpness, the most basic destructive power.This ... Was a real sword! At this moment, Li Hao realized that this was the true way of the sword.The other swordsmen, be it the sword Saint or himself, were not pure. Their swordsmanship was a mixture of various DAOs and various comprehensions, forming the sword principle. It was not a sword principle of this nature.At this moment, Li Hao didn't change his Tao of the sword. Instead, he looked at the firmament sword in his hand."As a sword, a sword that is essentially just a weapon, you are too complicated!"Li Hao mumbled. He had gained some insight into himself in this round, but he had gained more insight into weapons and the firmament sword.The firmament sword was only a weapon.But now, just like him, it seemed to be very messy and messy.He was still fine, he could still sort it out on his own.However, the firmament sword did not know how to sort it out.If this continued, the future of this sword would be limited.If he were to become stronger, this sword would most likely not be able to keep up."Returning to one's true self, returning to one's true self. A sword will always be a sword. Boundless sharpness and boundless firmness are actually enough ... You don't actually need all kinds of Special Forces and special DAOs!"Li Hao was touched. This time, he saw the true essence of the sword.To him, it was an upgrade. To the firmament sword, it was an upgrade."I should have gotten rid of all the miscellaneous stuff in your body and let you return to your original self ... At most, I should have left behind one or two unique DAOs. I shouldn't be like me, with a complete set of 10000 DAOs. You're just a weapon with some spirituality but not high intelligence!""It's almost impossible to count on you to sort out the ten thousand DAOs!"With this thought in mind, Li Hao walked out of this stage. Next, not only did he build a bridge for himself, but he also helped the firmament sword get rid of some unnecessary and messy Dao.It was enough for a sword to be sharp and sturdy.The rest were all minor details.Only when it was pure could it be considered a weapon.If it was more complicated, it was human.Seeing this, the mysterious man sighed with emotion again. This young man had a good eye. In the mysterious man's eyes, it was an opportunity for the sword to follow Li Hao.The owners of other weapons wished that their weapons knew everything and could solve any crisis ... But Li Hao removed all the miscellaneous things from the firmament sword.Although it looked weak, in fact, the essence of the sword was what Li Hao had kept.For the firmament sword, this was a process of removing the weeds and keeping the fine ones.The illusory figure was still thinking when suddenly, a muffled groan was heard. In the next moment, the seemingly broken Sui han crawled out from a lattice. He was bathed in blood and his great Dao was overflowing. He was feeling a little uncomfortable.His face was filled with joy!"Senior, I passed!"1,000 cells!Not a single block missing!The mysterious man glanced at him. His Dao injury was quite serious. He had used his powerful strength to force his way through the 1000 squares. For a rank five venerable sovereign, it was not easy, but it was not too difficult.However, was this how Dao chess was used?With the strength of a level eight venerable sovereign, what weapon could stop a level eight venerable sovereign if he tried to force his way in?

Not even the weapons of the Heavenly Kings!Didn't dao go instantly clear the game?However, was there any meaning to that?Just to have a good time?It was fine if there was no comparison, but with Li Hao seriously comprehending the technique, this guy was barging in ... The shadow really couldn't appreciate it. Usually, the shadow wouldn't hate such a boorish fellow.Since he couldn't comprehend it, he would just force his way through. At least he had completed the mission and obtained some benefits. It could also be considered a form of self-awareness.However, people were afraid of comparison.In comparison ... The virtual shadow despised it!He couldn't be bothered to say anything. In an instant, the praying mat on the ground appeared. There seemed to be something under the praying mat, but it instantly turned dark and nothing could be seen. Only the futon appeared in the illusory figure's hand."This is the futon that the secret agent usually uses for cultivation. It contains some of his comprehension of the Dao accumulation. The secret agent has been cultivating with this futon for many years ... You can take it and comprehend it!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 With that, the futon fell into mi Han's hand.He was stunned!He thought that this was the Shadow's true body, but wasn't this the real one?If so, why did he give it to me so easily?He had thought that he would need to spend more time explaining, or even ... Determine the winner with strength, and that the other party would go back on their word. In the end, he did not.Is that true?He hesitated for a moment.As for the illusory figure, he was getting more and more impatient.What hesitation!Since you've come here for enlightenment, why don't you give it a try, regardless of whether it's real or fake?Otherwise, what are you after?What's more, the dark emissary's comprehension was indeed just this, and there was nothing worth hiding. Whether one could comprehend it or not depended on one's ability. No one had ever heard of anyone who could surpass an expert through the comprehension of an expert without any other self-things.You must be joking!Tuo han hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and immersed himself in the thought.In an instant, he felt a vast Taoist connotation. He was overjoyed and even a little crazy. The Enlightenment of a level eight venerable sovereign, the Taoist connotation of a level eight venerable sovereign ... Was actually real!After all, he was a fifth rank venerable sovereign. That kind of Grand feeling, that kind of great Dao that was right in front of you, that kind of feeling that made you unable to extricate yourself, this was definitely not fake.He went crazy and even wanted to laugh wildly.This time, my trip here was worth it!This place was prepared for me."It's been so many years, and I've never heard of anyone who directly comprehended the Dao of an agent. I'm the only one who obtained it on my first time. It's incredible!……In the next room, Li Hao turned his head to look, but he didn't pay much attention to it.Level eight venerable sovereign's comprehension?Good stuff!However, it was dark-type, and he didn't really want to comprehend it now. To be honest, he would easily lose himself if he comprehended too much of such a profound thing. He might as well start from the basics and comprehend some other great DAOs.Balance!He wasn't really interested in the comprehension of the shadow envoys ... Of course, if it was in terms of energy, he would be interested.At this moment, he already had 300 bridges of life and death!With a few more, he would have become a peak type 3 powerhouse.Li Hao smiled and didn't care anymore. I won't stop until I see yin and yang. Otherwise, I'll be wasting my time here. As for wasting time ... Enlightenment is not a waste of time.As for Heaven's Fate and King Huai ... If I really miss them, then I'll have to pray for the best for the two of you. When I've gained some insight, I'll go out and find you.……Another three days had passed.Li Hao had already reached the 600th square.In fact, he walked even faster after that.Li Hao's River of Life and death was completely different from before. It was more orderly. Not only that, he had built 310 bridges of life and death, 30 more than before.The river of life and death still had so many stars, but the river water within it seemed to have become more complex, and more DAOs were fused within.For the past three days, the drought next door had been frowning, going crazy, and breaking down ...Li Hao didn't know what he had sensed, but he didn't care.However, seeing that the other party's physical body had already crumbled several times, and the marks of his great Dao were also showing signs of cracking ... This fellow had better not die from his comprehension.Of course, if he really died, he would just die.If this guy continued ... Li Hao suspected that there would be another sinister puppet in the dark Shrine.A fifth-grade Yin Chi!Yin swirls were formed like this, right?It had been almost 20 days since Li Hao had entered this place.……In the outside world.Kong Ji looked in the direction of the Hui long hall and raised his brows. It had been so many days.The last time he went in, he spent a total of five days.In fact, he had entered The Dark Divine Palace. Of course, he did not encounter the futon, but he had come into contact with the yin Chi. He had even killed a Yin Chi, seized the dark Tao accumulation crystal, and perceived the power of darkness.Some gains were not bad.However, five days was enough.This time, Li Hao's group had been in there for almost twenty days.Under normal circumstances, five or six days would be enough for an ordinary person to enter. Any more than that would only allow them to absorb some dark energy. It would not be of much significance."Is this a harvest?"Kong Ji thought silently.What kind of changes would that guy make this time?Enter Tier 3?This was not impossible. Li Hao was actually not far from level three. Level three did not require much comprehension. With enough energy, one could advance. Of course, for many venerable sovereigns, it would take a lot of time to advance to level three, even if they kept absorbing energy.

With these thoughts in mind, he instantly disappeared.During these days, the Supreme Dragon Emperor could not see anything.At this moment, he closed his eyes and cultivated to recover from the injuries he had suffered from the previous two attacks. Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and a look of dissatisfaction appeared in them. The next moment, it turned into a smile."The void is here!""Sect head."Kong Ji's expression was calm,"I wonder when Haoyue's group will be able to leave?""This ... I'm not sure."Emperor Hui long smiled."But it should be soon. They have been in there for so many days. They might have entered the dark Shrine. They might have some opportunities.""Are there any venerable sovereigns dead in the dark World?"Kong Ji said bluntly.The Supreme Dragon Emperor smiled and said,"I'm not sure ... Maybe ... There is." I'm not too sure. ""So you're pregnant?"Kong Ji nodded slightly. Since he couldn't say clearly, then there must be something.He didn't continue and quickly said,""I'll stay here for a few days. Is that alright, Abbey Dean?"Hui long Emperor frowned slightly and nodded after a while,""Of course I can ... But ... Is it necessary?""Let's wait and see,"Seeing this, the Dragon Emperor didn't say much.Could it be that this guy was afraid that he would attack Haoyue?Moreover, Haoyue and that Xi han had both entered The Dark Divine Palace. After so many days, it was hard to say if they could still survive.He didn't say anything more and just waited with her.20 days was not a long time for them.If they weren't in the dark Demon Ridge, in the chaos, 20 days would have passed in a flash.……Time continued to pass."Pfft!"Mi han spurted out blood again, and his eyes turned red. No, it was still not right.Why?He had already seen the secret envoy's Dao and was learning it, advancing forward. But why ... Was it so difficult to even reach level six, let alone level eight?Is it fake?"No, it's true. I can feel that I've gained something. I can also feel that I can reach that point if I follow this path. But why do I always have problems?He turned to look at the next door, his eyes cold and sharp.That Haoyue, unhurriedly and unhurriedly, had actually reached more than 900 squares today!Damn it!Although he was much slower than him, this fellow was full of energy and was not as pathetic as he was.Damn it!What problems did Tier 6 have?He couldn't help but raise his head,"senior, why haven't I been able to advance in rank?.""You want to ask me this question?" the mysterious man asked calmly."Senior, please give me some pointers!""If you go another 1000 steps, I'll tell you that this is also a benefit."Mi Han's expression changed slightly, looking a little unsightly.Another thousand steps? Can I still continue?At this moment, he also felt the changes in the great Dao's injury. It was getting more and more serious. Damn it.The comprehension of the eighth-grade Taoist connotation was still a little too much for him. Moreover, he was already injured, which was getting worse.He was worried that he would die if he walked another thousand squares.When he thought of this, his expression changed and he suddenly said,""Senior ... If ... Supreme Emperor Hao Yue passes the 1000th square, can we change the question? Instead of asking anything else, you're going to ask me the question I just asked. Senior, are you willing to answer?""Of course you can!" The mysterious man was stunned for a moment before he quickly smiled.Mi Han's expression returned to normal.At this moment, he was looking at Li Hao, who was next door.On the other side, Li Hao was still immersed in the Dao grid. He was not far from the 1000th grid.Li Hao had almost forgotten about this.On the other hand, Xi han had some thoughts.Since I don't have the chance to ask ... How about venerable Emperor Hao Yue help me ask?As for not helping ... At this moment, he was sure that the other party was a third stage venerable sovereign!And ... He thought of something else."Senior, will fighting be forbidden here?""Make a move?""Yes, the challengers should attack each other!""It's not forbidden. ""This place is a place for experts to comprehend and discuss the Dao," the illusory figure said calmly."It's normal for martial arts to meet the Dao. "The mysterious man knew what this person meant."However, your great Dao injuries aren't light. You were also injured in the first stage. You also forcefully comprehended the eighth rank venerable sovereign's Dao. Right now, your strength isn't even at the fifth rank. It's only at the fourth rank. As for that fellow, he was a peak third stage venerable Emperor of life and death ... To be honest, there was definitely a gap between them.However, in the Shadow's eyes, Xi han had many weaknesses because of his damaged Dao. He could be easily targeted. If he were to fight Li Hao, it would be hard to tell who would win.Rank three to rank four was considered a transformation.The gap between venerable sovereigns was huge. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 However, a peak rank three venerable Emperor of life and death could not say such things.Sui han didn't ask any more questions. He just kept silent and looked at Li Hao.He knew that there was little hope for him to break through now.There must be a problem!But since this figure didn't say anything, he couldn't determine his strength. In that case...He could only take this Haoyue as his first target.Li Hao had almost reached the 1000th square.……At this moment, Li Hao had already built 330 bridges of life and death. He was still a bit away from completion.However, the river of life and death was much stronger.The stars in the sky were also extremely bright.Li Hao's spirit had been greatly improved. At this moment, there was only joy in his eyes.The harvest was too great!Not now, but in the future.His understanding of the Dao, his understanding of the Dao of Yin Yang or other great Dao, how to strengthen and fill in the gaps, he had some insights. The key to his gains this time did not lie in the present, but in the future, in the foundation!At this moment, he entered the 1000th cell. The next moment, Li Hao's face lit up!

Yin and yang!No, not yin and yang, it was the Dao of yang!I've encountered it!He was overjoyed. He had only encountered yin and yang now. Even if it was incomplete, it was still something worth rejoicing about for Li Hao to encounter one of the two DAOs of yin and yang.The beginning was always the hardest, but as long as he kept going ... He would soon find the ultimate Yin Dao.This time, even Li Hao's River of Life and death had some fluctuations.He began to seriously comprehend and comprehend. He even tried to form a yang star in the sky of the long river. Before this, he had never tried to form a great path star no matter how powerful the other great paths were.At the current stage, having too many great path stars was not a good thing.The illusory figure in the sky also understood at this moment."Yin and yang ... Sir's death will be yin and yang?""Such great ambition, such great courage!"Be it life and death, or yin and yang, they were all great Dao of supremacy.This person actually used life and death as the foundation and yin and yang as the core. Could it be that he was going to comprehend the chaos of the universe next?Tsk tsk!What an ambitious little fellow!After an unknown amount of time, a small star appeared above Li Hao's River of Life and death with a boom. It was extremely dazzling and bright, and its intense masculine Qi overflowed the river and filled the void. Even a part of the intense dark aura in the river was melted.Li Hao was overjoyed. He walked out of the grid and subconsciously wanted to walk to the next grid."You've finished 1000 squares!"The shadow said.So fast? Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Li Hao was stunned. 1000 already?"No hurry, I'll wait a little longer ..."Li Hao was not interested in learning domains or self-awareness. That was not important. He would learn it sooner or later. At this moment, it was more important to continue learning in the game of chess."Supreme Emperor Hao Yue!"At that moment, Xi han suddenly spoke,""Since you're not in a hurry, why don't you help me ask a question?"Li Hao was stunned and looked at him.Help you?On what basis?Do you think I'm stupid or what?"Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, I'm only one step away from the sixth step!""It's just that right now, I seem to have encountered a barrier and some difficult problems. As long as fellow Daoist can help me ask and get some guidance from senior, I'll definitely repay fellow Daoist a hundred times more after I enter the sixth level!""After we leave, I'll help you find Dao crystals or even small worlds!" He said sincerely."I don't need those," Li Hao shook his head."My fellow Daoist ...""I want to continue to study the Dao chess. Daoist Xiaohan, you can solve it yourself. If you can't do it, then move another thousand squares!"Tuo Han's expression changed slightly, turning cold,""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, I'm very, very sincere! In addition ... You might not know this, but this place doesn't prohibit fights of magical powers!"Li Hao looked at the mysterious man, who nodded.""I don 't. This is a place for Dao discussion. I also welcome friendly martial arts!" Li Hao took a deep breath.What a waste of time!I still want to go out and participate in the Heaven's Fate hunt.Mi han laughed,"Haoyue, help me ask a question. You can continue to comprehend your Dao. Aren't you not in a hurry?" After I reach the 2000th step, I'll continue. If I reach the 2000th step, I'll give you my remaining chance ... It'll be considered as paying you back. Also, after I leave, my promise still stands. What do you think?"A forcibly twisted melon is not sweet.More importantly, if he were to kill that fellow, and that fellow refused to ask about it no matter what ... Wouldn't that be troublesome?Li Hao shook his head."That won't do. What's mine is mine. If I don't want to, can you force me?" Moreover, Daoist Chao Han, your injuries aren't light. I think you should cultivate for a period of time to recover from your injuries. Otherwise ... I'm afraid that you won't have the power of a fifth-tier cultivator. You'll be stuck at the fourth-tier at most!"Tuo Han's expression was a little cold,"there is an impassable chasm between Level 4 and Level 3!" Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, you probably haven't fought with a middle level venerable sovereign before. A middle level venerable sovereign is not something a low level venerable sovereign can compare with!"Li Hao had a headache.These days ... There were always people who liked to seek death.If you're at the fifth rank, it's fine if you're a little arrogant, but you're only at the fourth rank!What are you being so arrogant for?Tier 4, it's not like I haven't killed one before!Borrowing power from this place ... It's too troublesome. I don't dare to borrow the power of a rank eight venerable sovereign.However, this grandson's injury to the great Dao was very serious.If this continued, the great Dao might even collapse.Was he not afraid of death?I'm the time Emperor!It was not a simple life and death Emperor!,m However, he glanced at the shadow from the corner of his eye ... The key was, should he reveal something in front of this person?This person might not be a good person.Li Hao was a little conflicted.At this moment, he had two choices ... And no matter which one he chose, Shi Guang would be exposed.Of course, if he were to really fight with the other party ... He might not necessarily lose if he dragged on. After all, he was still a life and death venerable Emperor. However, that would be a waste of time. Dragging on until this fellow's great Dao crumbled ... Would it be possible for him to do so in eight to ten days?At that time, they would be hunting the celestial pole!The mysterious man felt that Li Hao still had a chance if he kept delaying.Li Hao didn't even think of delaying it.He wanted to gain enlightenment!Eight to ten days might be enough for him to walk another 1000 or 2000 squares.This was a rare opportunity!Is it worth it for me to waste this opportunity for a drought?Li Hao's head ached, but he made a decision in the next moment.Exposed ... So be it!

Borrowing force, he would not borrow force.However, Shi Guang, you guys don't understand.He instantly appeared outside of the chess board and looked at tuo han impatiently,""Come out!"He was stunned!In the next moment, he laughed. He laughed a little crazily. "You're crazy!"He instantly appeared outside the chess board and looked at Li Hao with a smile. This guy was definitely crazy.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked at him and frowned,"are you crazy? The wound on your great Dao is very serious. It might take eight to ten days, or one or two days for your great Dao to collapse. Do you really want to fight me at this time?"Mi han sneered,"do I need that long to finish you off?" Haoyue, if you help me ask ... I'll only give you some benefits, and definitely won't make things difficult for you. Even if ... You kill the others, it doesn't matter! However, if you don't help me ask ... In the end, you can only choose this. Otherwise, I will definitely kill you!"Li Hao felt helpless when he saw that he couldn't be reasoned with and was determined to die.He was too lazy to say anything more.In that instant, in the river, two cats woke up and the time stars in their bodies appeared again.Second cat pouted. Here it comes again.'This kid ... He's obviously qualified to fight with this crippled venerable sovereign, but he just has to take a shortcut ... Of course, this will save us time.'In the next moment, Time and Stars gathered once again.And the shadow suddenly trembled violently.'What ... Is this?As for Sui han, he was still trying to persuade Lin fan. However, in the next moment, his expression changed. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 At this moment, Li Hao slashed his sword!The speed was extremely fast!This sword was incomparably pure and didn't contain any power. Of course, there was one exception-the power of time.To a venerable sovereign, a few days, dozens of days, decades ... It was not a big deal. They would not lack decades of lifespan. To catalyze a fifth level venerable sovereign and consume decades of lifespan might cost you ten times or even a hundred times the price. It was not worth it!However, when a level five venerable sovereign was severely injured, the injury to his great Dao would erupt in at least two to three days, at most ten days to half a month ... At that time, paying a small price was nothing.Li Hao didn't want to either.At this moment, he was at a critical moment in his enlightenment. How could he have the time to deal with Sui han? at most, they would just go out together. When they went out, this guy would find trouble and Kong Ji would deal with him.But this guy just had to find trouble!It was really annoying!I've exposed Shi Guang!In an instant, with the power of time, before Sui han could attack, he suddenly realized that the injury of his Dao was rapidly deteriorating. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his eyes were filled with disbelief!How could this be?The injury to his great Dao, which had been stable before, instantly worsened as if it had reached its limit.The next moment, the injury of the great Dao instantly erupted. BOOM!In his body, the dark power was in turmoil, and the great Dao started to collapse!There was only shock in mi Han's eyes!How did the injury of the great Dao suddenly erupt?That was impossible!As for Li Hao, he didn't activate much time power this time. He only activated it for a moment, and his opponent's great Dao showed signs of collapsing. He activated it again.In the next moment, the power of time disappeared.He prayed that the illusory figure didn't see him at that moment ... Although it was a little self-deceiving, it was only for a while. He could only pray like this.In the next moment, the long sword transformed life and death. Life force was extracted, death Qi filled the air, the Dao of Nirvana covered the area, and the power of destruction erupted!There was only fear and unwillingness in the eyes of Sui han, who was on the verge of collapsing!"No, I'm a fifth rank venerable sovereign. I know that the injury of my great Dao would not erupt at this moment. Even if I were to fight, it would last for days ... How could it happen now?"No... Was that ... Time manipulation?How was that possible?As soon as he had this thought, his life force instantly dissipated, and the aura of death covered his body. His physical body began to die, and the bed collapsed. The power of destruction destroyed the load of the bed ...In his eyes, there was only shock and disbelief!Looking at Li Hao, Li Hao's face was calm. He stabbed his sword into the collapsed Dao, and the Dao instantly exploded.The longsword took away his life force, and the aura of death filled his entire body. A rank five venerable sovereign ... At this moment, there was only disbelief.I'm afraid I'll die Here?Would he die so easily at the hands of a third stage venerable sovereign?This was impossible!As soon as this thought appeared, everything was destroyed, even his thoughts.He didn't even have the chance to attack before the injury of his great Dao erupted and completely collapsed.His life force was instantly destroyed!A level five venerable sovereign was swept into the river by Li Hao. This time, Li Hao did not devour him directly. Instead, he suppressed him at the bottom of the river. He would keep the level five venerable sovereign alive!He would think about it after he entered the 4th rank. At this stage, he did not lack the energy to advance to the peak of the 3rd rank.Li Hao didn't stop at all. He instantly entered the chess board and continued his next move.As for the illusory figure, he suddenly stretched out his hand, wanting to stop her ... But in the next moment, he retracted his arm. At this moment, there was only shock in his eyes."I see!"The mysterious man murmured.So that was how it was!Flowing time!Life and death, yin and yang, all of these were the foundation of time.This person's ultimate goal was actually the Dao of time. It was unbelievable. More importantly, at this moment, this person was in control of some time power. Although it was very shallow, it was indeed time power.No wonder he had the aura of the three messengers, no wonder he could kill an injured Tier 5 in an instant ...So that was how it was!At this moment, the mysterious man finally understood.He only felt that it was ... Unbelievable.In this era, a time path cultivator had actually appeared.The time path master that master Tian Fang had been searching for ... Could it be ... This person?Of course, he was still far from that.But what about the future?No wonder the three messengers had left some traces!It was too unbelievable!At this moment, even the illusory figure was shaken.For a moment, she didn't know what to say.
