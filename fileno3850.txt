As it flowed out, it instead ... Became active!This meant that even if the power of his great DAOs had completely disappeared, they would still be in this world. As long as his spirituality was still there, he could even break through Li Hao's restrictions and walk out of this damn world.He could sense all of this, and this time, he had no more worries.In an instant, he was engaged in a fierce battle with Li Hao!Li Hao, you don't understand ...Don't understand heaven and earth?A thought suddenly appeared in his mind. No, Li Hao had opened the sky himself. How could he not understand?As soon as this thought appeared in his mind, the long sword instantly pierced through his head. Li Hao's third hand appeared and attacked. With a crack, something seemed to have shattered!Jie Nan's eyes were burning with anger!You're humiliating me!"It's so small ..."Perhaps there was no one else, or perhaps there were no bystanders, but Li Hao suddenly laughed. Like a giant bear, he suddenly hugged his opponent. With a boom, it was as if his bones and muscles were broken!Kachaa!Tribulation's bones and bones seemed to have all broken. The power of the great Dao flowed out again. Tribulation's eyes were fierce.Just nice, I'll break your path.Li Hao, your Dao has too many loopholes.At this moment, outside the great Dao, the power of tribulation gathered again, as if it was going to turn into a second tribulation. In the great Dao of Jianghu, the head of the Tribulation Empyrean was instantly pierced through!Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows and shook his head."Focus on nothing else. You still don't understand what Tian Fang said!" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ What?The Tribulation couldn't care about this, it only lost some of its spirituality!It was nothing.He wanted to go out!He fought Li Hao again.His spirituality broke through the despair and headed toward the power of the great Dao outside, toward the power of the catastrophe. He could still recover in an instant, and Li Hao couldn't kill him.However, at this moment, the power of the great DAOs seemed to be summoned by something.Suddenly, the power of the Tribulation went out of control!In an instant, a chaos great Dao suddenly appeared like a piece of divine text. As a primer, the chaos great Dao appeared, and a dog seemed to have appeared in the great Dao!Black Panther was also extremely surprised!At this moment, the power of the Tribulation and the Dao spirit of the Tribulation were actually ... Separated? What was going on? However, it didn't care anymore. It opened its mouth and suddenly sucked in. Countless forces of calamity were instantly sucked away. The black leopard was extremely surprised. It was so simple. Without the control of its spirituality, the forces of calamity were instantly sucked dry!The spirit of the Tribulation had just broken through the great Dao of the pugilistic world and instantly transformed into a human form. It was a little dazed.Behind him, Li Hao walked out and shook his head."You're not a Martial Master, and you're not a martial artist. You're seeking your own death by running away from a battle! If you insist, you might have a chance to live, but you're just trying to be opportunistic and will die without a doubt!"In an instant, the sword was drawn!If he didn't run away from the Tribulation but continued to fight with him, the Black Panther wouldn't have a chance, but he wanted to take advantage of it, which was a taboo in Jianghu!The calamity venerable sovereign suddenly turned around, and a sword appeared in his eyes!The sword slashed down, and the sword Qi instantly exploded in his spirit!Calamity felt that his spirituality was dissipating rapidly. He was in disbelief and looked at Li Hao unwillingly."I want to know ... If it wasn't for this dog, would you ... Be able to kill me when I walk out?"What if the Black Panther had not seized the power of his great Dao?Li Hao nodded."You can't do it. You're too cautious when you make a move. You'll die sooner or later!"The Tribulation was extremely bitter, and he was overcautious?Could he not be overcautious?"Tian Fang...Is simply unrivaled ...""Fearless and fearless, a loss is a loss, there is no undefeatable legend in the pugilistic world! My master has lost before, and so have I ... There's no such thing as an undefeatable world!"The spirituality of the Tribulation was rapidly flowing away. He looked at the world in front of him and muttered,""But I ... Opened the sky ... The master of opening the sky, will he also be killed in the world?"Then what was the point of opening the sky?Li Hao didn't say anything else. You still don't understand. A world without people is not a world. You've just created a space, not a world.To you, this world is a form of restriction."Survival is the core of heaven and earth, the core of spirits, the core of wisdom, the core of civilization!"BOOM!The sword light exploded, and its spirituality scattered in all directions before it instantly collapsed.The Tribulation was filled with some unwillingness, some helplessness, and some confusion. Gradually, its consciousness dissipated and integrated into the surroundings, completely disappearing.A small heart appeared between the heaven and earth. It was like a star and it started to spin.Li Hao exhaled and suddenly smiled.""You didn't even want to break out of the sky until you died, so why did you open the sky!"Stupid!If you had broken through the heavens, how could you have died so easily? the heavens have restricted you.Tribulation, you didn't die unjustly![PS: I don't think we'll make it to the 20th. It's okay, it's just three days. That's about it. Good luck, old Eagle!]

Chapter 3851 Absolute Time And Space_ 1
The Tribulation was dead.The heavens and earth depended on it.The sky did not collapse. At this moment, a great Dao fluctuation spread down, and a person ... Or a dog seemed to appear in the entire void. Heibao was a little confused.Where was this place?Why did it feel like he had gained something after absorbing the power of calamity? was it a complimentary gift?He could sense his surroundings. It was as if ... As if he was in a world of his own!The next moment, he saw Li Hao.He was a little happy.However, he was also a little apprehensive. He had yet to break through the origin of chaos.After absorbing the power of tribulation, it was about to deal with the origin of chaos when it suddenly felt that there seemed to be another space in its body. Therefore, it came to check it out. Now that it saw Li Hao, it was a little nervous.I haven't finished my work yet!I'm not slacking off on purpose.It turned around and was about to run toward the chaos great Dao to deal with the origin of chaos. Li Hao instantly appeared and smiled."What are you running for?"Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther called out. Even though this was only its spirit and not its body, it still maintained the habit of only calling and not speaking."Don't be anxious, there's no hurry. "Li Hao stopped the Black Panther from leaving. He looked at the world in front of him. A piece of divine text appeared in front of him. It was the "calamity" divine text that had connected to the power of calamity.Li Hao glanced at the Black Panther and said after a moment,""I want to refine this world, fill it with the power of my great Dao, and perfect the power of my body. My will is enough, but it's best to mix reality with illusion ..."The Black Panther did not have any objections, and it did not care.Li Hao, on the other hand, remained silent for a while before continuing,""However, when I refine this world, I won't control its spirit. You will! Place your core source inside and temporarily hide it!"Black Panther didn't understand Li Hao's thoughts, but he didn't ask. He just nodded.It didn't understand, but it didn't matter. It was fine as long as Li Hao understood.Li Hao touched the illusionary Black Panther, which was just the intelligence of a Black Panther. He quickly said,""Go back and continue with your work. I'll let you know when I need you. Just take a bite and leave the rest to me ..." He said."Woof!"The Black Panther didn't say much. Its intelligence quickly returned, but not completely. Part of its core intelligence was left behind and integrated into the divine character "calamity." It didn't know what Li Hao wanted to do, but it didn't stop it from following his orders.After the Black Panther left, the martial arts world in front of Li Hao quickly dispersed.The power of despair returned and instantly transformed into a long sword.He looked around and thought for a while. Soon, countless divine characters appeared, including the character "calamity". In the blink of an eye, the long sword swallowed the divine characters, and the power of calamity spread.Heaven and earth shook.Before long, the entire world seemed to have been refined by Li Hao, and the power of countless great DAOs poured into his body.Li Hao's flesh and blood had almost been extracted by second cat and the others to create a fake body.He had gathered the source of all worlds and Reforged his physical body. However, it only had the power of will, but it lacked the power of the great Dao. At this moment, these divine texts merged into every cell, and the power of the great Dao began to merge into his body.The great Dao of tribulation mainly contained the power of tribulation, but there were also other great Dao powers.After a large number of experts died, the power of these great DAOs had almost all fused into this side.At this moment, Li Hao was constantly absorbing. He had absorbed the power of despair between heaven and earth, and the power of calamity was a kind of chaotic and turbulent power to chaos.It could be said that Li Hao had gathered all the power of the dark side of chaos.A large amount of power of great DAOs entered his body and was refined by Li Hao. The White robe outside his body began to turn black.His entire person seemed to be walking towards the dark side.Li Hao raised his head to look at the sky. Tian Fang didn't appear, nor did he stop him. It was impossible for Li Hao not to know that he was dead. However, Tian Fang was still waiting.It was waiting for him to absorb the power of calamity left behind by the calamity.What a confident person!Or perhaps ... It wasn't just confidence. This was the result that Tian Fang wanted.This was the result he had been waiting for.A large amount of power of the great DAOs churned wildly.The longsword beside him shook violently.This was the black-scaled sword!The longsword trembled for a while, and only stopped when Li Hao reached out and grabbed it. At this moment, the power of great DAOs filled Li Hao's body, and a dark aura kept spreading out, but was swallowed by the longsword.Darkness surrounded Li Hao.The whole world suddenly began to shrink along with the vibration of the long sword. A moment later, this newly-created sky had completely integrated into the long sword. The long sword trembled and became more and more powerful.……The void trembled.Li Hao walked out.The human King and the others all heaved a sigh of relief.Spring Autumn heaved a sigh of relief.He was just a little surprised that the Tribulation ... Really died, and it was killed by Li Hao very quickly.This guy was really unexpected. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Tian Fang, who had been silent all this while, also smiled."That's right!""Very good!" He looked at Li Hao and nodded.He seemed to be very satisfied.He was satisfied with Li Hao's current state.In the entire chaos, the power of despair and the power of disaster were still spreading toward Li Hao. The power of darkness, on the other hand, was devoured by the human King and Li Hao.The chaotic sky seemed to have truly brightened.The boundless darkness and the chaos that could easily devour experts seemed to have become a bright void at this moment, no longer possessing the powerful devouring power.

Chapter 3852 Absolute Time And Space (2)
Some hidden worlds had emerged at this moment.They were like stars.It lit up the entire chaos!The originally dim world was now exuding a faint power of light, becoming more and more dazzling.Tian Fang looked around and saw that the dark energy was still spreading toward the few of them. He sighed,""I've never seen such a bright chaos since I was born!""Darkness, darkness, and chaos actually make people uncomfortable and depressed ... Only light can make people open their hearts.""It's a pity that the sky of chaos is always so dark. "Tian Fang seemed to be recalling something. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ He recalled the chaos many years ago, and the countless years of chaos and turmoil.He sighed again."Until one day, someone from the future came to me and told me that the darkness would eventually pass and the light would cover the chaos ... I thought he was just joking. But he was so serious ... I believed him."Li Hao smiled."And then ... You believed it so easily? and you did it?"Tian Fang also revealed a smile,'it'll be very difficult! You have to understand that at that time, there were more than 20, close to 30 rank nine venerable sovereigns. Although I was strong, I was not invincible. This is the first reason. The second reason ... Back then, everyone was at their peak. It was not like the weaklings you killed today. It was just a disaster, and in the end, we recovered some of our peak. ""At that time, it would be very difficult to do anything ... Moreover, I know that the source of the chaos is not them!"He shook his head."The source? it's not them. Li Hao, do you know where the source is?" Li Hao shook his head."I don't know. When there's someone, there'll be turmoil. I don't think that chaos will be peaceful after all the so-called power of darkness is extracted and all the experts are dead. Blindly pursuing peace ... Is actually not reliable!""Where there's someone, there'll be conflict," Li Hao said."Unless you're a heaven battering genius. If that's the case ... I'll be too disappointed!"Li Hao sighed."If you, tianfang, only pursue a great unity like the chaos and establish a world without any desires, perhaps there wouldn't be any Wars. But ... Only in your generation!" He said. If you die, you'll be in an even worse state!"If Tian Fang only wanted to become a stronger huntian, Li Hao wouldn't have to fear him."No, no, no, I'm not huntian!"Tian Fang shook his head, still as calm and confident as before. He looked at Li Hao and smiled. "You're right, there are people, there are disputes, there are spirits, there are disputes! I don't hate disputes or chaos. I just simply hate people who destroy beautiful scenery. "At this moment, Tian Fang looked at Li Hao and said with a smile,""What I want to do may not necessarily have any conflict with you, do you understand? I didn't stop you from killing them. If Su Yu thinks I did it to absorb the darkness, then he's wrong. " He shook his head and looked at Li Hao."From the beginning to the end, I wasn't very interested in any of this. In your eyes, I might be only trying to dominate the world and the chaos ... Everything I do is to kill my opponents. That's a wrong idea."Li Hao raised his eyebrows.The human King scoffed.Su Yu frowned and didn't say anything.Even now, no one was too clear on what Tian Fang wanted to do. They had made many judgments, but Tian Fang had not given them an accurate answer."Zhan and I once chatted for a long time!"Tian Fang continued,"I regret not meeting him earlier. It's a pity ... He seems to be an idealist and not a practical person. He feels that if he continues, many people will die. So, he doesn't really want to meet me. He feels that if he sees me, he might be influenced by me ..."Tian Fang laughed. Today, he had already laid the foundations for everything.Everything that needed to be prepared had been prepared.He didn't mind talking about this."In fact, you have to sacrifice the interests of a group of people for everything. Of course, the premise is that you help the majority and sacrifice a small number of people! For example, this time, we have sacrificed the calamity. They will definitely be unwilling. Since that is the case ... We can only die in order to prevent them from interfering with our plan. "Tian Fang sighed with emotion."The chaos is very big, but it is also very small. I don't know if the chaos is naturally formed or if it was opened up by someone, just like these worlds, just like these heavens and earth ... Man-made or natural, these are actually not important!""Li Hao, do you know why I've been waiting? waiting for you to extract all the dark chaos?"Li Hao looked at him and shook his head."I don't understand. I thought you were going to combine light and darkness. It seems that you don't think so.""Because the opposition of DAOs will make the world more stable ..."Tian Fang explained,"the Dao of the two extremes is an opposing Dao, but it is also a Dao to stabilize the world!" In fact, be it light or darkness, yin and yang, life and death, none of them could be missing! There's no such thing as pure light or pure darkness. If there's only one, then this chaos will collapse sooner or later!"Li Hao nodded.This was true.Clearly, Tian Fang understood this very well. In fact, he was even clearer than them. What he was after was not to destroy the darkness.Tian Fang continued,"Zhan cultivates in time. I cultivate in space. Do you think it's the Dao of the two extremes or two unrelated great DAOs?"

Chapter 3853 Absolute Space-Time_ 3
Was time and space opposing each other?Was time and space necessarily opposed to each other?Li Hao had also been cultivating time. After a moment of silence, he said,""I don't think it counts. Time is time, space is space ...""No, no, no!"Tian Fang shook his head,'you're talking about Absolute Space and Absolute Time. The two are not related. But in my opinion, the two ... Are actually closely related! "In addition, be it time or space, they all absolutely exist, and there are no changes to the senses ..."The current him seemed to be the real him.At this moment, he ... Even made people unconsciously think of a person, Zhan.Tian Fang didn't have much in common with Zhan, but at this moment, he seemed to become a little fanatical. Although Li Hao had never seen Zhan before, he couldn't help but think of Zhan from his words."Chaos has always been expanding. Li Hao, do you know that?"He looked at Li Hao."This proves that space is expanding and that it really exists. It's not a change in the senses. I cultivate the way of space, so I can sense it clearly!"Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows but didn't say anything. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ  "As for time, it also exists ...""That's why," Tian Fang continued,"in my eyes, these two DAOs are real DAOs and not illusory DAOs!""This is different from what you imagined, The Phantom path of will!"Li Hao's heart moved.These were just his own thoughts. In his opinion, if the great Dao of heaven and earth was divided into illusion and reality, time and space should belong to the illusory Dao. Only real existence, visible and tangible, could be considered the real Dao.What Tian Fang meant was that space-time was also the truth Dao.Of course, these were just Li Hao's thoughts. However, Tian Fang actually understood Li Hao's thoughts.Li Hao frowned."Then, senior Tian Fang, you mean ... These two are the truth Dao. They are not opposing DAOs. So, I still don't understand what you mean."Tian Fang frowned,'who said that truth Dao must oppose Phantom Dao? In your eyes, is life and death reality or Phantom path? The two opposing paths, was this the difference between truth path and Phantom path? Yin and yang? What about light and dark? Li Hao, your understanding of time and space is too shallow. Your comprehension of the great Dao is not bad, but it's not unparalleled!"Li Hao was despised.Of course, he didn't refute and only nodded.Perhaps!He was young, but of course, he was not young. His path of desire had experienced countless years in the myriad world. In the past, he had wandered around neo martial. To say that he was young was just his actual age. However, in terms of mentality and experience, he was not young at all.However, experiencing more did not mean that he had surpassed Tian Fang.At this moment, he was also thinking about Tian Fang's words and the meaning behind them. "Then, senior ... What do you want to do?"Tian Fang laughed."Forget it. Since you don't understand, I'll make it simpler! I've actually been waiting for an opportunity to collide with the opposing great DAOs and reach an absolute balance!""The kind that will never lose balance. I believe that when these opposing DAOs reach the end, or rather, when they reach a certain point, they will be unified!""In other words, there will be a state that will never change. It will be a state of absolute balance, absolute justice, and absolute stillness!"He seemed to be a little excited."For example, when the collision of time and space reaches the extreme, an absolute space and time state will appear! Here, the space was limitless. There was no need to expand. Everywhere you walked was space! But here, time is endless, and everyone can live forever ... At this point, there's no point in fighting!""Society will develop, civilization will develop, and they will continue to explore, explore the end of space ... In fact, this end does not exist!""They will explore the end of time, and this end does not exist!""Whether it's darkness or light, it doesn't have much meaning here!"Tian Fang laughed."The so-called fight for supremacy is only a fight for longevity, territory, and size. But what if this place is boundless?" What about the endless time? Li Hao, do you think your so-called martial arts world will appear in such chaos?"The group of people all looked at Tian Fang as if he was a lunatic.Everyone said that Li Hao was crazy, the human King was crazy, and Emperor Yu was crazy ...However, at this moment, the way they looked at Tian Fang was the same as how other people looked at them!Yes, it was the same look.This was a lunatic!Absolute space, absolute time ...Li Hao frowned and fell into deep thought.Would it even exist?He did not know.He didn't deny Tian Fang's words, but ... This theory sounded so unbelievable. When time and space collided, an absolute space Zone would appear. An absolute time zone with no boundary and no end to time ...In this place, it didn't matter if you were fighting for power or glory.Everyone was immortal, and everyone's territory could be expanded infinitely. As long as you wanted to leave, you could go to the boundless land at any time.In that case ... There was no point in fighting for supremacy.The opposition and chaos of chaos could be completely eliminated in such an era.Once and for all!But ... How could that be possible?

Chapter 3854 Absolute Time And Space (3)
It was only at this moment that Li Hao completely understood Tian Fang's thoughts. His expression changed slightly."So, senior, you mean that you control the Dao of space and the Dao of light and order, while we control the Dao of time and the Dao of chaos and darkness ... So ... You want to fight with us in a balance and see if we can create such an absolute space-time?""Yes, but also wrong!"Tian Fang said excitedly,"it's not whether I can or can not, but ... Definitely!" Unless we're not strong enough! As long as it's strong enough, I think it will definitely exist! You and I ... Or me, the few of you against each other is already the limit of the chaos! If you and I can't create absolute time and space, then those who come later will have no chance!""The disaster didn't bring me such expectations, so ... They must die. Death is their release. If they don't die now, they will die sooner or later. But their deaths are not meaningless. On the contrary, their deaths are to fulfill your wishes!""Back then, when Zhan and I discussed the Dao, we talked about the problem of absolute space-time. Zhan felt that it was possible, but he felt that it only existed in theory. It did not mean that it could be realized. Many things only existed in theory, but I felt that ... Since there was such a theory to support it, why not give it a try?"At this moment, the human King grinned."So this is what senior Tian Fang is after ... Then it's simple. Senior can continue playing by yourself. We don't have any conflict. Like I said, there's no need to fight to the death. We're all cultured people ..."Everyone looked at the human King.The human King was stunned by his gaze and cursed. What? am I not refined? Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ He was a true graduate of Magic city's martial Sciences University!Do you know how powerful he is?Just the two of you, and you're still looking at me? What are you looking at!Have you two graduated from college?By the way, is there a University where you two are?Trash!If you keep looking at me, I'll chop you to death!Li Hao smiled, but Su Yu said thoughtfully,""We understand what you're saying, senior. In other words, we're both people who pursue peace, people who pursue the end of the great Dao ... It's just that ...""Senior, I'm afraid it's difficult for us to fight you alone, and we can't reach the so-called balance. So ... Do you have other ideas?" he sighed.Li Hao chuckled."Of course there are. For example ... If we can't do it ourselves, we can just melt the few of us together. Let's try it, right?" Tian Fang smiled and nodded,"that's what I mean!" You are all smart people. In fact, I don't want to kill you, nor do I want to do anything to you ... It's just that although you are growing fast, I can actually wait until the day you and I reach a balance ... But the limit of chaos is here. If this continues, perhaps ... My life will come to an end!" He sighed,'I'm already two million years old. I'm willing to continue waiting. But if this continues and I die, will there be another Infinite Prime cultivator who has attained the Dao of space? Even if they did, would they be the same as you? That balance will never appear!""I've been thinking about it. If the three of you can completely merge ... You, Silver Moon, neo martial, and myriad worlds are actually all from the same source and have been nurtured by time. So, do the three of you take the initiative to merge and fight me, or ... Do I help you?"He was very serious!He was not interested in killing the three of them at this moment. That was not his goal. He looked at the three of them, hoping that they would take the initiative to merge and then ... Reach a level of balance with him.He was going to use the strongest two extreme DAOs to collide and attempt ... To open up his so-called absolute spacetime!He was not afraid of the opponent being strong!He was just afraid that his opponent was a lunatic.This was what the enemies of Li Hao's group feared the most. Today, Li Hao's group of three had the same thought. They weren't afraid of Tian Fang's strength, but he was a lunatic ...This was troublesome.At this moment, the human King was still interested in making fun of him,"Tian Fang, do you mean that you want to squeeze the few of us together and fight with you again?" I don't have any objections, can I not be a butt? Why don't you let Li Hao or Su Yu be ... I'll be the head?"Su Yu chuckled."Human King, I don't like to hear that. Of course, if Shi Guang doesn't have any objections, I won't reject her either! It's just that ... I think senior Tian Fang's meaning is ... Even if we're together, shouldn't our wills also be in harmony?""Of course." Tian Fang nodded seriously."Absolute space-time, in my opinion, also requires absolute will! The three of you have too many thoughts in your mind, and they don't meet my expectations. If that's the case, it's very easy for there to be a deviation. Thus ... I'll just leave behind a will! To avoid any problems ..."The human King was curious,'who did he leave behind? Mine? I think it's possible!"Li Hao was helpless."Senior human King, senior Tian Fang is not joking with us. He is very serious!"The human King smiled,"I'm serious too!" I'll ask around. If You Want Me To Stay, I'll consider ..."Tian Fang shook his head."It's not yours. You're not calm enough. Su Yu, I don't know much about him, but I can feel his madness. I know Li Hao the best. He's the most rational, so I want to keep Li Hao's will!"

Chapter 3855 Absolute Time And Space (1)
Reason!"I'm flattered!"Li Hao smiled."Are you looking down on me?" the human King was enraged.Su Yu shrugged."I'm not crazy. Compared to you, I think I'm more normal."Only lunatics would think that others were lunatics. To think that a lunatic like you would actually want to create absolute spacetime ... That's what a true lunatic is.He wouldn't have known if he hadn't been out of the infinite worlds, but now that he was out...He realized that the primordial chaos was still dangerous.There were lunatics everywhere!I'm actually very normal.LAN Tian didn't think it was abnormal anymore. It was normal.At this moment, the few of them also understood that Tian Fang hadn't looked for them and waited for them because of any personal grudges or to unify the primal Chaos. This fellow ... Was just like Zhan, a crazy cultivator.What absolute spacetime ... Everyone might not completely disagree with this theory, but this kind of ridiculous theory ... Unless there was really a chance to test it, otherwise, who would do it?In order to achieve his goal, Tian Fang had made all the rank-9s and everyone else present his targets. They were all part of his plan.And the other party's goal ... Was to eliminate the inequality in the entire chaos.Eliminate the darkness and chaos.At this moment, you couldn't even tell if he was a good person or a bad person."What do you mean?"Su Yu looked at Li Hao. What do you think?Li Hao was also helpless at this moment."If senior Tian Fang only wanted to unify the world and the way of the two extremes, we might still have a chance and a way to live ... But now, he's doing it for his Dao, his dream, his theory ... And even got Zhan's approval. Instead ... There's no way out!"Su Yu nodded.This was true.At this moment, Spring autumn's eyes flickered. This means that ... I'm not involved?Even if I don't care, it'll be fine?What Tian Fang wanted to deal with was only these three people to create the so-called absolute time and space.Then I'll leave now ... Can I?While she was thinking, Li Hao suddenly smiled.""Senior, in that case, it's only related to the three of us and not the others? Then, can the others leave now?"Tian Fang first nodded, then shook his head."Neo martial, Silvermoon, the people of the myriad world can't leave. You're all involved with the time of the battle. In order to make sure nothing goes wrong, I have to fuse you all together! As for the Spring and Autumn period ..."He glanced at spring and autumn, as if he was thinking whether there was a need to keep her.Spring Autumn was in a dilemma!The next moment, Tian Fang shook his head."If she didn't devour the grade-9 Dao, it wouldn't matter if she left. It wouldn't matter if there was one less grade-8 who was outside the game. However, she was greedy and devoured the DAOs of a few grade-9 experts. That won't do. I'm worried that the balance will be unbalanced in the end ..."Spring Autumn wanted to curse!Did I swallow it? They gave it to me!It was really ... An unexpected disaster!He had encountered a group of lunatics.A bunch of lunatics!Now, he didn't have to hesitate anymore. He said that even though he was just a small character, he had to stay in case he needed it."It seems like there's really nothing to talk about," Li Hao sighed.Tian Fang nodded."There's no room for negotiation. I might not win. You two have merged into one, and your wills are United. In fact, you're on par with me. I'm not saying that you must win.

Chapter 3856 Absolute Time And Space (6)
He didn't do it for the final victory. He just wanted to verify the validity of his theory.Li Hao had a headache.At this moment, he had thoroughly felt the strength of his opponent. He had originally thought that his opponent's will might not be that strong. Of course, it was only a wild fantasy. However, when he really felt his opponent's will, and even ... The existence of Shi!Tian Fang was really too strong. With thousands of DAOs gathered, the power was increasing, and the will was strong. Such a person gave people the feeling of despair and invulnerability!The entire chaos great Dao was under his control!The source of the power of great DAOs was endless, while Li Hao and the other two could only rely on the power of great DAOs that spread out to fill their bodies."I can't wait!"Tian Fang took another step forward and appeared near the three of them with a smile.""Li Hao, if the power of despair isn't enough to make you stronger, you can try again. I won't stop you from mastering other paths of will. "I think that heart gate of yours isn't bad. If you think it's not enough ... Then you can absorb the essence of any realm in the primordial chaos! Everything was only temporary. When the absolute space-time appeared, there would no longer be a need for worlds, and worlds, to hinder the development of civilization! The world had obstructed the development of the great Dao! "A complete integration with no distinction between races and civilizations. This is the space-time that everyone is pursuing!""You're crazy!""You're crazy!""What's wrong with you!"At this moment, the few of them laughed bitterly and cursed.It was rare for them to reach a consensus at this time.At this moment, the human King no longer laughed and cursed. He licked his lips,""I don't want to merge with you. Of course, I can make the decision, but if I don't make the decision, I won't do it. So ... I can only kill this old lunatic!"Su Yu also smiled."I'm not used to being controlled by others. At most, I'll be killed. It's not like I haven't died before. Death is actually nothing!"Li Hao even laughed."I don't have your interests and hobbies. I don't have the will to accommodate countless people for no reason ... It's better to completely obliterate them. At most, I'll use my spirituality to completely obliterate you and reconstruct you and me ... To be honest, I feel terrible just thinking about it!"He chuckled."Since the two of you don't have such an idea ... Then ... Why don't you spar with senior Tian Fang? at this point, show me whatever you have. Otherwise ... I'm afraid you won't have the chance!"The human King chuckled. The yin and yang energy around him was once again absorbed by him. His aura grew a little stronger, but it was not too obvious. At this moment, the human King could be considered to have reached his limit. However, compared to Tian Fang's overwhelming aura, he was still inferior. The difference was huge.Li Hao's aura was constantly fluctuating as he absorbed countless willpower.When Spring Autumn saw this, he wanted to say a few words. Could he really win? Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ However, seeing that they were ignoring him, he could only keep quiet. He was a little pessimistic. Feeling Tian Fang's invincible aura, he finally understood that the difference between Grade 9 and Grade 9 was so huge!Behind them, Yuan Shuo and ER Mao retreated silently. Although they had been fighting a rank nine before, they had retreated now. This battle was probably not something they could participate in.The flesh and blood on second cat's body suddenly disappeared. In the blink of an eye, they covered Li Hao like clothes.Flesh and blood began to grow, and it was no longer as pale as before.Li Hao made a grabbing motion, and the power of the five elements in Yuan Shuo's body suddenly surged out and was taken away by Li Hao. Yuan Shuo raised his eyebrows slightly, while Li Hao smiled and said,""I'm borrowing it. Otherwise, senior Tian Fang, I'll beat you to death."Tian Fang chuckled."It's all the same. There's no difference. They've been tainted by time, so ... They can only fuse with you. So, it's up to you. It's just a matter of time."As soon as he finished speaking, he took another step forward. An endless aura pressed down on them, and the three of them kept retreating. They felt as if the rivers and seas were overturned.A blade, a sword, and a book were floating in the air.Tian Fang couldn't wait!The three of them did not say anything. In an instant, the saber and Sword Books appeared at the same time, cutting through the heaven and earth as if the world had been created.Light illuminated the primordial chaos, but it was instantly extinguished!A wave of spatial energy instantly destroyed everything. Tian Fang sighed,""No, it's not enough. You guys are too weak! This kind of power is not enough to create an absolute space-time collision. It's too weak!"No one replied, and only The Book of Swords reappeared.He was no match, but if he didn't try, how would he know the result?Even if ... The result was not satisfactory.

Chapter 3857 Scheme (1)
The path of despair appeared once again.The glint of blades and the shadow of swords, the road of the pugilistic world, and the great Dao spread out, as if hundreds of millions of people were watching the battle.At this moment, the billions of human figures seemed to have turned into the beings of chaos.How could the pugilistic world be lacking in liveliness?Be it fame or defeat, there would always be people who would spread the word of mouth. How could there be no spectators on a trip to the martial arts world?The wind and clouds of the pugilistic world come from my generation!That sense of hopelessness came from all living beings. At that moment, the scene of several people fighting at the top of the martial world seemed to appear in front of their eyes.Li Hao, who had turned from white to black, Su Yu, who held the civilization booklet, and Fang ping, who had a crew cut and held a black knife.There was also that submissive and fearful Chunqiu.There was a cat and an old man outside the court.As well as the indestructible and outrageously powerful Tian Fang.Saber Light and sword shadows!At this moment, the human King laughed, and his laughter reverberated through the world."Good, good! Li Hao, I don't like you very much. Today, I'll watch all living beings in the chaos kill Tian Fang, which suits my taste! How could a strong person not show his divinity in the heavens? If I can't show my divinity in front of the masses, what's the use of having this strength?"The human King laughed heartily!It was as if Li Hao was finally to his liking today."I have the chaos-vanquishing saber that can cut the heavens and earth and destroy everything. It doesn't matter if I win or lose. No one will watch the battle on the chaos peak. No one will know my name. How regretful!""I'm the neo martial arts human King, Fang ping!"The human King laughed out loud as his long saber swept across the sky, piercing through the heavens and earth with boundless pride!Even if I'm invincible, someone has to see me.He was not Li Hao, nor was he Su Yu. Among the three of them, he was the only one who would put on a show every time he went to battle.He didn't say "unparalleled human King" or "congratulations to the human King." He just didn't feel that way and felt uncomfortable.The nameless One is despicable!Since he was famous, why not be nameless?How hypocritical!The human King introduced himself and let all living beings in the chaos know that in the past, the neo martial human King fought against Tian Fang. If he won, the chaos would know him. If he lost, Tian Fang won and was invincible. There was also someone who fought against him at the peak of the chaos.Win or lose, I will become famous!At this moment, Emperor Yu of the myriad realms also laughed. He did not introduce himself. At this moment, words appeared in the void."Su Yu of the myriad realms will fight here!"The seven words turned into an imprint that was imprinted into the depths of chaos and the hearts of all living beings.Who didn't want to be famous?However, he was a little arrogant. "I want to be famous, not the name of an ordinary person. I want to let all living beings know that in the future, in the future, in the future, in the future, when I don't know if I still exist, they will all see me in their moment of despair." Su Yu of the myriad world!Once, in the depths of despair, he had fought against the unrivaled Tian Fang!He didn't say anything, but the human King laughed out loud,""Hypocrite! But ... This is good!"Good!He had learned it! It turned out that he could still pretend like this. He didn't have to shout "who am I" every time."I've imprinted it with my divine power into your hearts. If there's despair, come see me. I'm Su Yu of the myriad worlds. I've just arrived. In case you don't know, future people, come see me in the depths of despair!The two of them displayed their abilities and left their imprints.This was how the pugilistic world was! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Wasn't it just a title?There was no first in literature and no second in martial arts!If they didn't fight to the death, what kind of world was this?Li Hao chuckled. The great Dao was spreading. The current Jianghu road was not very useful to Tian Fang. He was too strong and had already surpassed the limit of despair. To Tian Fang, the Jianghu road was just an ordinary Dao.At this moment, Li Hao waved his hand, and countless doors appeared on the great Dao. It was as if countless doors of the heart of the Dao had been opened, connecting all the lives and worlds in chaos.On the heart gate, he carved a few words "Silvermoon Li Hao" with his sword!"If there's a heart, then there's me!"Li Hao chuckled. At this moment, he was also competing with the human king and emperor Yu."You guys can't do it, but I'll build a heart gate with my emotions. With emotions and desires, there will be a heart gate, and with a heart gate, there will be me, Li Hao!"Silver Moon Li Hao!Su Yu's name is just a mark of my despair.The human King was even more boorish. He shouted,"the only thing that remembers you is today."As for me ... I've imprinted my mark on the hearts of the people. As long as the hearts of the people exist, I exist.It was obvious who was more skilled.“艹!”"Really ... Shameless!"Be it the human King or Emperor Yu, they both cursed in a low voice.He was really shameless.They didn't cultivate this Dao to the depths of other people's hearts. Li Hao, on the other hand, had really cultivated the Dao of the human heart. At this moment, he had actually branded it as a door. How shameless.The three of them looked at each other and smiled.Was winning or losing important?Not that important.Tian Fang was too strong. They knew it very well, but they didn't want to merge. Sometimes, killing the enemy wasn't important. They dominated an area and took this path, but they only raised their name!If the three of them fused into one, there would be me in you and you in me. Would that still be them?If he couldn't live on, so what if he could?"Thus, from the very beginning, from the Trinity, from the past, from the future, from the present, from the moment the battle ran through their lives, they knew that perhaps one day, we would join forces. However ... Joining forces does not mean that we are one.Even if he was defeated, he was defeated.There was no such thing as an undefeatable legend!This battle had nothing to do with the chaotic common people. These people were just passersby. Be it Li Hao, Fang ping, Su Yu, or Tian Fang, none of them had the intention to kill the chaotic common people.The common people were just passersby, just spectators. This battle had nothing to do with the survival of living beings. The three of them were only saving themselves, and Tian Fang was only doing it for his own ideals.

Chapter 3858  624-Scheme_2
This was the struggle for Dao and survival.Tian Fang was fighting for Dao, while the three of them were seeking survival.……At this moment, billions of people looked up at the sky.In the pugilistic world, there were flashes of blades and shadows of swords. On this day, the chaotic common people knew the names of three people.Neo martial artist Fang ping, myriad world Su Yu, and silver Moon Li Hao!They looked on in a daze, as if they were entranced. In their despair, there was a glimmer of hope. They didn't even know who was the enemy and who was the good person. They also didn't know who would win and who would lose.At this moment, all the living beings were at a loss.However, it didn't stop them from watching this battle. It didn't stop them from feeling the chaos fluctuating, the world shattering, the confrontation between several experts, the great Dao filling the heavens, and at this moment, even the chaos was collapsing!At that moment.In the sky, the Yin Yang grinding stone appeared and suddenly came pressing down. The human King was forced to retreat. A cat meow came from the long saber, and he was in pain. Tian Fang appeared and slapped down with his palm. The Yin Yang grinding stone came pressing down!"So what if I've left my name in history? You can't see that the nine Heavens and earth are still here, and the king of order is no longer here!"Tian Fang chuckled.He did not stop the three of them from leaving their names.It was meaningless."Fame and fortune move people's hearts. Once absolute time and space appear, everything will be illusory. Everything will start anew. So what if I remember you?A person's death was like the extinguishing of a lamp. The nine Heavens and earth were still here, but how many people still remembered the master of order from the past? Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ When life and death came out, the human King would retreat.He turned around and threw a punch at Su Yu. Life and death appeared, and Su Yu's expression changed instantly. Heaven and earth became the land of reincarnation. Su Yu had experienced life and death, but at this moment, he was still wandering between life and death.When he looked back, Tian Fang had already disappeared. Tian Fang appeared in front of Li Hao. He punched, and the five elements appeared!The five elements cage!In the cage, a fierce tiger appeared."I know that you're like a tiger in a cage and don't want to be bound by this cage. But today ... Can you break my five elements cage?" Tian Fang's voice reverberated."The human King has reversed yin and yang, Su Yu is fearless of death, and you, Li Hao, are not willing to be bound and call yourself a hero of the pugilistic world ... Today, I've broken the bottom line in the hearts of the three of you and broken the core of your martial arts. Let's see, can the three of you still hold on?"He was unbelievably powerful!The 10,000 DAOs struck out casually, like a strong man against a child. One person against three, but he still toyed with the three in the palm of his hand.This was Tian Fang. He had the power of 10000 DAOs and was the strongest expert in the chaos, a limitator.Right at this moment, the three of them were facing the greatest crisis in their lives. The human King stared at the Yin Yang grinding disc and let out a shrill roar. He slashed out with his long saber and the figure of a huge cat appeared. However, it was still unable to resist the Yin Yang grinding disc and was constantly suppressed!Emperor Yu, on the other hand, had experienced life and death. At this moment, it was as if he had stepped into the cycle of reincarnation, as if he had returned to the past when countless demons and ghosts were killing him. Time and time again, it was as if they wanted to send him back to the past and break the invincible heart that he had built up over the years.As for Li Hao ... He was surrounded by a cage. It was as if he had really become a tiger in the cage. At this moment, with a roar, a Black Tiger appeared above his head, its sharp claws about to tear the cage apart! BOOM!The cage was indestructible. With a slight tremble, it instantly exploded with even more powerful great Dao power and suppressed him!The three experts had joined forces, but in the blink of an eye, they had encountered the greatest danger in their lives.Tian Fang wanted to break all their pride!You guys can 't!At this moment, the chirping of cicadas rang out from behind Tian Fang."Time!"The spring and autumn appeared, and the great Dao appeared. Countless avatars fused together, and time seemed to wither. It devoured the power of several rank nine great DAOs. At this moment, she was extremely powerful. She had wanted to escape.However, Li Hao's group of three had encountered a huge crisis from the very beginning.When she saw it, she felt both despair and helplessness.He could only fight!Otherwise, if the three of them were defeated, she would not have a good ending either.Tian Fang turned around, looked at her, and smiled."Mole crickets don't know spring and autumn, and mushrooms don't know the dark and gloomy days!""To me, you're nothing but a Mantis. How can you stop me?"As Tian Fang pointed out with his finger, it was as if time was merciless, and the Dao of spring and autumn was instantly stirred. Tian Fang laughed,""The Dao of life and death requires balance. If one only knows how to absorb, how can it last long!"In an instant, spring and autumn were revealed!The power of countless great DAOs flowed out madly. A bloody gash appeared on Chunqiu's forehead, and she was killed on the spot!However, in the next moment, Tian Fang suddenly frowned.Li Hao and the others, who were in the middle of breaking moves, also looked over. Tian Fang was too strong. Although Spring Autumn was strong, he was killed in an instant. In fact, they were all very surprised.However, at this moment, they were all slightly stunned. Li Hao, who had been frantically breaking through, suddenly stopped and looked into the distance, letting the huge cage shrink rapidly.A new spring and autumn was gradually born between heaven and earth. It seemed smaller, but it also seemed stronger.At this moment, Spring Autumn seemed to be completely enraged."I hate it when people say that about me. What do you know about the Dao of spring and autumn? What do you know about life and death? You haven't experienced it, and you're only relying on your own imagination. Do you really want to understand the myriad DAOs of the world?

"My life is like a blade of grass, and I've gotten to where I am today because I'm indomitable. I've never feared death! Do you really think I'm afraid of you?"In an instant, the world changed color. It was as if spring had returned to the earth!I was indomitable, I struggled again and again, and was reborn from death!Whether it's Li Hao, Su Yu, or the human King, have they died as many times as I have?

Chapter 3859 Scheme (3)
After so many years, my strength may not be the best, but if you expect to kill me once and break my great Dao, then you are underestimating me!"Don't think that you're the only ones who can fight this guy!"At this moment, spring and autumn was extremely proud, like a weed, reborn in the midst of death.""Tian Fang, kill me a million times. Perhaps ... You can succeed!"Tian Fang looked at her and laughed, interesting, really interesting! No wonder you can reach where you are today. Your heart is higher than the sky, your life is thinner than paper ... Yet you possess the ability to regrow plants. Your Foundation is unbroken, and your life is endless!"Spring and autumn, this was beyond his expectations.After killing Spring Autumn, he had actually resurrected in an instant.The spring breeze blew again!This was spring and autumn.Even though the Dao of withering and flourishing was a little out of balance at this moment, she still managed to balance it out with her strong will to survive and reverse the situation.This was really unexpected!Spring Autumn had a proud look on his face."Don't think that I'm useless even though I've dominated the South for so many years. I don't have any other abilities. I can live longer than anyone else!"She instantly reappeared, the desolate world!"Aren't you the one with the myriad DAOs? I'll break your Dao and destroy your Dao. Don't you pursue balance? Let's see how you can balance the destruction of the great Dao!"Spring Autumn was too arrogant!At this moment, the human King, who was being suppressed by yin and yang, suddenly laughed,""Li Hao, you have good eyes. I didn't know that you were waiting for this!"The spring and autumn of this moment had actually started to destroy the DAOs of heaven and earth, and was destroying the Dao of Tian Fang.No wonder Li Hao had asked Spring Autumn to keep it.This person was not only difficult to kill, but he was also very useful."So-so!"Li Hao smiled humbly, but he was surprised. How could I have known that she could really grow again? I overestimated her. If I had known, I wouldn't have let spring and autumn watch the show!I didn't think of that. I didn't think that she would be able to revive after being killed by an expert like Tian Fang!At this moment, Su Yu, who was a little shaken by the reincarnation of life and death, looked at the spring and autumn. He suddenly laughed and said softly,""He didn't die in spring and autumn. Interesting. After a million years, he experienced a cycle of life and death ... He transformed a million times to be born. Shi Guang, I know why you kept him here. You ... Wanted to motivate me. So that's why!"I originally thought that I had no fear of death.From the age of six to my rise to power, it has been more than ten years, three to four thousand days and nights. I have been killed day and night, and I have been in pain for my entire life!However, today ... He suddenly felt that it was nothing much!This spring and autumn was just the spring Autumn Cicada. Time withered and bloomed, a year of life and death, a million years, time after time, it transformed, time after time, struggling to survive ...So, compared to her, it seems ... My death is not worth mentioning! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ A few thousand times compared to a million times. What was this?At this moment, Su Yu understood!Li Hao probably knows what I've been through. Black scale escaped. Black scale is Li Hao's desire, so he naturally knows what I've been through. Thus, he used spring and autumn to tell me ... That what you've been through is nothing more than this!Life and death situations weren't that difficult to overcome!Su Yu!You're not even as good as spring and autumn, the cicada?Su Yu laughed. The disturbance of life and death had made him extremely uncomfortable, but at this moment, he seemed to have realized the Dao. He laughed, and countless corpses appeared in front of him as if he had been killed countless times.At this moment, he sighed."Life and death are nothing. The universe is so big, and reincarnation happens again and again. What's a few thousand times of life and death?"He punched out, and divine text appeared!The life and death divine text instantly bloomed with infinite light!Countless power of life and death was instantly absorbed by him. He burped and laughed,""So it's that simple. Thank you, fellow Daoist Spring Autumn!"At this moment, spring and autumn was once again being crushed by Tian Fang, and he was in a daze.What are you thanking me for?​ As for Li Hao, he couldn't help but laugh. He knew what Su Yu was thinking, but ... He was really wronged. I left spring and autumn behind not because of you, not because of the human King, and not because she could not die and destroy the Tian Fang Dao.You've all misunderstood!Of course, he wouldn't explain himself at this moment. He laughed and pretended to be profound,""I knew that Tian Fang would use this method to destroy our inner weakness. He didn't want us to die too miserably, and he didn't want us to waste too much energy and cause an imbalance ... So, he would only use the simplest method to kill us ... Su Yu, you don't have to thank me. This is also because you have a good comprehension!"Su Yu looked at him and his surroundings. The five elements cage was rapidly suppressing Li Hao, making the black Tiger on top of Li Hao's head roar madly, but to no avail. He couldn't help but say,""I don't think you're that amazing. If you can break this cage, I'll believe you. Otherwise ... I still don't really believe you. I was just expressing my thoughts just now!"Li Hao laughed and said,"what's so difficult about that?" I'm waiting for senior human King. If senior didn't break through the yin and yang, and I broke through the five elements first, wouldn't the human King be at the bottom? he's so proud, how would he see us in the future?"The human King was furious upon hearing this!"I don't believe it!"As soon as he finished speaking, he swung his long saber in the air. Qi and blood appeared above his head and instantly condensed into a saber. At this moment, countless figures seemed to appear in all directions, as if a neo martial artist had been reborn."The human King is invincible!""Unparalleled human King!""To the human King, to the new martial artist!"His roar reverberated through the heavens and earth. The human King's eyes turned red and carried a hint of madness. Who was he looking down on?"I, Fang ping, will become stronger as long as there are more people. It's commonly known as going crazy when people come!How could I lose face in front of so many people and all the chaotic creatures?
