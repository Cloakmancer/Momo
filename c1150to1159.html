        rge private room, the food was served and the few of them ate and drank.
         Hou Xiaochen's decision to cause trouble for the financial division was not a sudden one, but a matter of opportunity. But now, he felt that the opportunity had arrived.
         As for whether there was a deeper scheme behind this, Li Hao didn't know yet.
         He was only thinking about the gains and losses while eating and drinking.
         Hou Xiaochen wanted to use him as a tool for his breakthrough.
         Why was he looking for her?
         Be it the Golden spear or the Jade Rakshasa, were they both very weak?
         Putting aside the Golden spear, the unsealed Jade Rakshasa should not be weak.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Since that was the case, why did he have to be the blade?
         Just in time?
          That might not be the case.
         Li Hao's mouth was full of oil. He also gave some to the Black Panther. After eating for a long time, he thought for a long time. Should he be the saber? was it worth it?
         After a long time, he had some ideas.
         Perhaps ... If he wanted to open his eyes and see the world, he should personally participate.
         The current him might not have understood.
         However, he knew that hou Xiaochen wouldn't dare to kill him.
         Yuan Shuo, Hong Yitang, and the light sword were actually Li Hao's supporters.
         Even if hou Xiaochen's scheme succeeded in killing Li Hao, it would not benefit him in any way. It would only cause Silvermoon to completely fall apart, further widening the rift between Silvermoon martial arts forest and the government.
         With this in mind, Li Hao finished the bowl of soup in one gulp, burped, and raised his head with a smile.""Minister, is this a small matter? We'll just take the Heavenly Star Douluo arena back to the night patrolmen and that's it?"
         "Of course not."
         Hou Xiaochen had finished his meal long ago and was currently sipping on some tea."I'm calling you in advance for two reasons. First, we'll obediently hand over the leadership of this area. That's the best possible outcome."
         "Second, if you don't give it up, you'll naturally fight back with all your might! There are people from all levels, officials, in the dark, civilians, nobles ... It's even normal for you to be assassinated by the three major organizations. In the process of counterattacking, seize the opportunity and give the other party a thunderous blow!"
         Hou Xiaochen suddenly laughed,"As long as we seize the opportunity and don't leave any room for discussion, we can beat the dog while it's down. There are countless people who want to take down the First Division!"
         "As for the specific operation, you can do it yourself!"
         "Whether to control it in time, or let it spread, or implicate it, or end it haphazardly ... It's all fine!"
         "There will be different consequences depending on the degree. If it's just to establish a foothold in stellarsky city, then we'll do something simple. We'll just destroy their biggest stronghold. This is much simpler."
         Li Hao understood.
         Hou Xiaochen was trying to determine how far he could go and how far he was willing to go. As for how far he could go, he would naturally face different levels of retaliation.
          He was only responsible for the transformation.  Clearly, they were also measuring Li Hao's endurance.
         Li Hao, who had eaten something, began to drink his tea. After thinking for a while, he said,""Where's the helper?"
         "Do as you see fit. If you can mobilize the night patrollers, then do so. If you can't ... Then there's nothing you can do. You don't have the ability. On my side, you know the Wei Wu Army. Only the Golden spear Army has some strength to help you. Otherwise, we don't have enough experts!"
         There weren't many experts in the Wei Wu Army. Jin Shan was Xu Guang, while Mu Lin was slightly weaker than the rest. As for chief Yu, he was hou Xiaochen's Secretary, so he naturally had to serve him.
         At this thought, Li Hao smiled and nodded.""Understood!"
         It didn't help much.
         He had to rely on himself!
         Old hou really ... Really thought highly of himself.
         ……
         At the same time.
         The news instantly exploded.
         The demonic sword had entered the capital!
         Li Hao had arrived in stellarsky city, and what was even more shocking was that hou Xiaochen had declared war on the financial division in nine Dragon Pavilion!
         Yes, a declaration of war!
         It was just a star Douluo arena, but at this moment, in the ears of others, this was a declaration of war. It was clearly telling the Financial Secretary that if he was smart, he would step down.
         If you don't know what's good for you, I’ll violently encircle and annihilate you!
         " I’m the only law enforcement agency of the Government. This point has allowed the night patrolman to have the upper hand. However, sometimes, one's reputation also needs the support of strength. To be able to become one of the nine divisions, there's no doubt that one's strength is strong!
          ……
         At the inspection Office.
         A high-ranking official, with a slightly pale face, quickly entered the inspection division's conference room.
         At this moment, the young-looking inspector had arrived.
         Seeing the person's face turn pale, he smiled.""You received the news?"
         "Yes ... Yes!"
         "I'm fine, what are you panicking for?"
         "It has nothing to do with us," the inspector chuckled,"this is hou Xiaochen's declaration of war. Besides ... We don't even know if he'll succeed, so what are you panicking about?" Now that demonic sword Li Hao is here, hou Xiaochen is quite interesting ... Does he think that Li Hao can suppress everything, or does he think that he can keep everything under control?"
         After saying that, he suddenly snorted,"let them play by themselves!" This guy had sent Li Hao here without any prior notice. Was he trying to intimidate everyone with Li Hao's wreaking havoc in the Marquis dingguo's residence? If that's the case ... Hou Xiaochen's thinking is too simple!"
         He frowned and said,"the Heavenly Star Douluo arena is involved in many things, and it's very broad!" Where did the superpowers and demons inside come from? Countless natural treasures were also a problem, and the benefits involved in secret were even more astonishing! Other than the four Seas business group, the sky Star Douluo arena is his biggest source of profit ... He even gave up some of his other rights back then for this ..."
        
         "Forget it, I'll just sit back and watch the Tigers fight!"
         "Secretary, what if ... We are involved?" an expert asked.
         The Secretary laughed,"why would I?" If they failed ... They would be the ones to take the fall! If we succeed, it will be a good thing. If we can really make Liu's head dizzy, and in the end, he himself can't help but come down ... We will make a move ... Not to say destroy the Liu family, but at least we will weaken them by three points and eat half of the Financial Secretary!"
         The Secretary laughed and said,"good news!" If we fail, we don't have to take responsibility, but if we succeed, we'll get a share of the loot. Isn't this a good thing?"
         "If the Silver Moon Martial Master is willing to be my blade, then I don't mind!"
         Clearly, he had also seen through many things.
         However, just as hou Xiaochen had said, if the benefits were big enough, so what if he was a Silver Moon Martial Master?
         He could still be saved!
         The premise was that it would not only bring trouble without any benefits. In that case, any cooperation would not last long.
         "The night patrolmen have passed Li Hao's appointment as the Vice Governor of Tianxing," someone else said in a low voice."Is Minister Yao finally thinking of something?"
          "Hahaha, it's hard to say!"
         "Where's Huang Long?"
         Someone laughed and said,"will Huang Long be involved?" Even if he didn 't, he wouldn't just watch as hou Xiaochen succeeded, would he? Hou Xiaochen has succeeded, but I'm afraid Huanglong won't be able to stand still!"
         Clearly, these people were like mirrors that had seen through everything.
         Above, the inspector bureau chief said lightly,""Let them fight for themselves! If the Silver Moon Martial Master can't even defeat Huang Long, he won't be able to take down the star Douluo arena ... Those silver moons are just asking for trouble, so don't worry about them. "
         "Secretary, what is hou Xiaochen's final goal?"
         Some people looked at the Secretary with suspicion. Other than gaining a firm foothold and making a name for himself, what other purpose did hou Xiaochen have?
         If it was simply to gain a firm foothold, then taking such a huge risk and choosing to start a war with one side ... It was too risky and not worth it.
         "The final result?"
         "What final result do you need?" the Secretary asked. He only needed to get the nine divisions to fight and let everyone know that he, the Silvermoon barbarian, was not to be trifled with. He needed to let a portion of the people see Silvermoon's strength and fighting spirit. Wasn't that enough? Since when do you insist on a conclusion?"
         He laughed and stood up."Alright, that's all. Don't bother me anymore. As for Li Hao ... As a night patrolman, since he's in stellarsky city ... He's not afraid of being assassinated, so let him be!"
         "Understood!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Everyone responded one after another. No one said anything more and soon, they dispersed.
         ……
         At the same time.
         Such meetings were held in many places.  The Financial Secretary.
         The chubby Secretary Liu was still smiling as he sipped his tea. He thought for a while and said,""He's picking on the soft persimmons. It seems that hou Xiaochen thinks that my financial division is the fattest and softest! Li Hao also thinks that he can use us as stepping stones ... To intimidate everyone and gain a firm foothold. He also wants to attract everyone to eat meat together ..."
         "Secretary, how ... Should we deal with this?" someone asked.
         "We can't back down."
         Secretary Liu said with a smile,"at this time, I can't give up!" I've already given in to hou Xiaochen today, so tomorrow, my Four Seas business group will be gone. The day after tomorrow, the taxes from the provinces will be gone. Three days later, I'll be gone!"
         At his level, if he didn't advance, he would fall behind.
         He couldn't give in even a single step!
         Once he took a step back, everyone would be like sharks that smelled blood and instantly swallow him!
         The alluring woman gritted her teeth."From what hou Xiaochen is saying, I'm afraid that he's using Li Hao as a knife to tear open a hole ... Then I'll kill Li Hao! Li Hao just defeated the Xu family and became famous. With his death, not only did two divine weapons fall into our hands, but we also gained a great amount of wealth and fame ..."
         It was easy to break out of the situation.
         If he could kill Li Hao or even hou Xiaochen, he would be done for.
         Or, as long as they were defeated and their weakness was seen, countless people would devour them.
         The result was the same for both sides.
         Whoever revealed a weak state this time would soon be devoured by the countless Tigers around them.
         As for why hou Xiaochen wanted to use the financial division as a Whetstone ... Secretary Liu felt that it was probably because he was too easy to talk to.
          "Are you confident in taking Li Hao down?" Secretary Liu looked at her and smiled.
         "There are!"
         "I'm in the transformation stage," the woman said calmly."As for him ... To be able to escape from Xu Qing's sealed state, he's not weak. His combat power is very strong. At the very least, he's at the late stage or peak stage. With the wind chasing boots, he's even reached the level of the transformation stage."
         "But ... Even so, I'm confident I can take him down!"
         Secretary Liu fell into deep thought. After a while, he said,""Not enough ..."
         Not enough!
         It was just a simple sentence, but it made everyone feel strange. He felt that one transformation stage cultivator was not enough to deal with Li Hao.
         Of course, Li Hao was indeed valiant.
         He had once escaped the pursuit of many metahumans in the East.
         The alluring woman nodded,"I understand the Secretary's meaning, but if he wants to escape ... As long as he leaves stellarsky city, there will be countless evil wolves waiting outside the city!" Li Hao is in a worse state than us. He can't rashly leave the city. Once he does ... He's dead!"
        
         In stellarsky city, everyone had to at least maintain the rules on the surface.
         On the surface, no official would make a move on Li Hao.
         However, if you leave the city ... Then it's no longer up to you!
         Such a big piece of fat meat, everyone wanted to have a bite.
         "So, if he still wants to run away like before, then he's wrong! Second, as the Vice Governor of the night patrol, if he were to fight in the city and destroy the buildings or kill civilians by mistake ... Secretary, I think we have the responsibility and obligation to make the night patrol give us and the dynasty an explanation!"
         "Pa pa pa!"
         Secretary Liu clapped and laughed,"well said!" A vital point! That's right, compared to the Heavenly Star Douluo arena, Li Hao's biggest problem isn't us, but rather that he can't leave the city and can't accidentally hurt civilians. These will all limit him!"
         "Hou Xiaochen wants Li Hao to intimidate us. He's wrong. Li Hao has the most restrictions!"
         Li Hao was strong, but he was too troublesome.
         It would be very difficult for Li Hao, who had been too cautious, to display the same combat strength as the East.
          "However, I still can't be careless!"
         He smiled and sent a message to the woman after a moment,""Send an assassination order to Fei Tian ... Not only Fei Tian, but also red Moon and Yama. Also ..."
         After he warned her for a while, the woman had an idea in her heart.
         "Alright, that's it. You can go now!"
         He waved his hand and waited for everyone to leave. After thinking for a while, he walked to the back of the financial division.
         After a while, he passed through several secret passages and entered a secret room.
         "Father."
         He didn't go in and just waited outside.
         A moment later, a voice came from inside,""You still feel that this isn't safe enough to kill Li Hao?"
         "Yes!"
         Secretary Liu didn't try to hide it,"Li Hao isn't easy to kill!" He has two divine weapons, and at the most crucial moment, hou Xiaochen will act. He's not weak, and even I can't say for sure that I'll win. "
         He then continued,"actually, it doesn't matter if we really abandon the Heavenly Star Douluo arena. If we can keep a low profile, it doesn't matter if we have less wealth. However, at the current stage, once we reveal this stance, we won't just be losing the Heavenly Star Douluo arena. Father understands this as well."
         "AI!"
         In the secret room, an old voice came out with a sigh,""In the end, I still can't escape the vanity Fair!"
         Secretary Liu didn't say anything. Yes, who could escape?
          They were all ordinary people!  The first generation of secretaries all had big ambitions, but what about now?
         Didn't they all become evil dragons in the eyes of others?
         The change in status, the change in the era, and various other factors eventually caused the nine divisions to lose their original intention and no longer wanted to change.
         Sometimes, he felt helpless.
         "What do you want me to do?" the old voice sounded again in the secret room.
         Secretary Liu thought for a while and said,"to deal with Li Hao, I can only kill him instantly!" I would like to borrow ... A divine power talisman!"
         A divine power talisman!
         As soon as he said that, a faint pressure seeped out of the secret room.""Do you know that to me, my divine power is not completely stable yet? the damage caused by stripping my divine power to create a divine power talisman is very great. It might be ... Beyond your imagination!"
         Secretary Liu said in a deep voice,"if you kill Li Hao, you'll get two divine weapons!" It was enough to make up for his father's loss! And it's also because of the great losses that they won't believe that I'll look for my father at this time and make him pay a great price just to kill Li Hao!"
         "Hou Xiaochen, Yao si, and even that guy from the inspection Office will all be silently watching me ... Once I make a move, it might be their chance, so I won't make a move and give them the chance ... They won't believe that father's divine ability will make a move!"
         As soon as he said that, the old man in the secret chamber laughed.""That makes sense. Even a Lion needs to use all its strength to hunt a rabbit! A person like Li Hao couldn't be underestimated. A divine power talisman ... Might not be able to kill him! From what I know, he might have used an origin talisman before, but who knows if he has more ... If he does, it will be enough to offset the attack of the divine power talisman. "
         Secretary Liu frowned slightly. Was there more?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Not necessarily!
         If he really had one, why didn't he use it when he was chased by Xu Qing to that extent?
          However, if there were any ... It would be terrible.
         "What do you mean, father?"
         "Since you have made up your mind, then you must eliminate all evil and eliminate the roots. You must be decisive. Instead of paying the price bit by bit, it is better to pay an even greater price and get it done once and for all!"
         The old man's voice was extremely old as he pointed at his son.""The Xu family was just adding oil to the fire little by little, and in the end, they suffered heavy losses. With a lesson learned from the previous example, how can the Liu family make such a mistake again?"
         "A divine power talisman might not be able to kill Li Hao ... A divine power talisman is dead, but a person is alive!"
         Secretary Liu listened quietly and the old man continued,""Since we've already placed our chips, let's place more ... Don't keep the 12 small handheld energy bombs in the Liu family's warehouse."
         Secretary Liu was secretly shocked. The so-called energy bomb ... Was the thing fan Chang used that day. Even Hong Yitang, who had unsealed some of it, could only retreat. There was only one bomb!
         The Liu family was rich and powerful. They still had 12 energy bombs in stock.
         Each one of them could pose a huge threat to those in the metamorphosis stage. If one was not careful, they could even be blown to death. This thing did not have a large area of effect like the city-destroying bomb, but its attack power in a small area could even surpass the city-destroying bomb.
         The city-destroying bomb only had a larger area of effect and was easier to cover.
        
         There were a total of 12 of them ... Anyone who exceeded the transformation stage would be killed by the explosion!
         Even divine-tier cultivators would not dare to claim that they could survive such an explosion.
         "One talisman, 12 energy bombs ... Then, I'll let Wu Yong and quicksand, the two metamorphosing cultivators, take action. Then, I'll let the three major organizations of the fairy world take action ..."
         Secretary Liu said for a while and then hesitated,"Father, Li Hao won't have a chance to escape from such a siege, will he?"
         This bargaining chip was no ordinary one!
         If they were lucky, it wouldn't be too difficult to kill a god art.
         p However, his father was right. Since he had already decided, he should make a bigger bet. If he won, he could naturally make up for his losses.  "I don't know."
         The old man seemed a little tired."Anything is possible. What's done is done. Don't regret it ... Regret will only make you more hesitant and hesitant." Whether it's right or wrong, whether it's successful or not ... You've put in your greatest effort. If you still fail even after that ... Then Li Hao's life shouldn't end!"
         He had tried to kill Li Hao with the killing technique, but he had failed. What else could he do?
          "I understand. Thank you for your guidance, father!"
         "No need ... I'll come and get the talisman tomorrow!"
         "Alright!"
         Secretary Liu didn't say anything more and turned to leave.
         Behind him, in the secret chamber, a skinny old man shook his head and sighed. Li Hao ... Might not be easy to kill.
         The bloodline inheritances of the eight great families had experienced all kinds of crises, but they were still alive and kicking, so how could they be so easy to kill?
         However, that was the only thing he could do at the current stage.
         ……
         All parties were preparing for something.
         In the nine Dragons Pavilion, the people who had eaten their fill were also ready to leave.
         As he walked out of the private room, there happened to be people coming out from other private rooms. As for whether it was a coincidence or something else, no one knew.
         Hou Xiaochen smiled and nodded at everyone, then bowed slightly,"Greetings, secretaries!"
         Many people walked out of the private rooms.
         Some people nodded slightly and smiled without saying anything.
         Some people ignored him and sized up Li Hao's group before quickly leaving.
         There were also people who smiled brightly and said playfully,""Good luck! Heavenstar's security is in your hands, do your best!"
         “……”
         The secretaries all left.
         Li Hao also took note of these people.
         He looked at hou Xiaochen, who replied calmly,"Four secretaries, the Internal Affairs Division, the merit Examination Division, the criminal law Division, and the etiquette division."
         Hearing this, Li Hao nodded and said with a smile,""Are these the weakest four divisions?"
         The other three divisions, the military law Division, the inspection Division, and the administration Division, had been fighting for the position of boss.
         The financial division and the Department of Commerce were famous for being rich.
         The financial division was rich because the taxes of the provinces had to go through them, and they also had business groups under their command.
         As for the Department of Commerce, it was not just the province that collected taxes. All the large corporations and small companies had to go through the Department of Commerce. It was hard to say who was richer.
         In this day and age, having money also meant having strength.
         Hou Xiaochen laughed."Don't be so cocky. No matter how weak you are, if someone hits you, they'll hit you like a child!"
          "I'm a child. "  "How old am I? how old are they?" Li Hao chuckled.
         "You!"
         "Forget it, let's go. It's fine as long as we get to know each other," hou Xiaochen shook his head.
         Li Hao nodded. It was time to go back.
         As for where he would go back to ... Who knew? he would just follow hou Xiaochen for now.
         "The drop of spring of life that I packed, is it ready?" he turned to the female manager.
         The female manager was particularly awkward.
         You really have the nerve!
         "That ... You'll need to pay 100000 divine energy stones," she said helplessly.
         "Didn't Secretary Liu say it's a treat?"
         "That ... When Secretary Liu left, he said ... He said ..."
         Li Hao was stunned for a moment. He couldn't help but curse,""That fatty went back on his word? He's one of the nine secretaries, and he's going back on his word after treating us to a meal?"
         Oh my God!
         What kind of person was this?
         He had promised to treat them to a meal, but he actually went back on his word. There was such a person?
         "Secretary Liu can just put the money for the meal on the account, but ... The spring water of life, actually ... Doesn't belong to the category of food money," the female manager said in a low voice.
         She could only say this.
         Because she also felt that Li Hao was too embarrassed to ask for it, and Secretary Liu ... Was too embarrassed to go back on his word.
         Li Hao was a little depressed. He glanced at hou Xiaochen,"This Secretary ... Is really interesting!"
         The Secretary!
         To be honest, he didn't expect that such a Big Shot would actually have the nerve to go back on his word!
         Hou Xiaochen laughed.
         Chief Steward Yu also laughed. She didn't speak much at night, but at this moment, she also laughed and said,""He's an idiot. He gave you a drop of the spring of life and asked you to raid his house?"
         “……”
         Being shameless was the right thing to do. If he really wanted to be shameless ... Then he would be too stupid.
         Li Hao was extremely regretful,"forget it!" I didn't expect that he wouldn't give me a single drop of it!"
          "How much did we spend tonight?" he asked the female manager.
         "Eight thousand divine power stones!"
         "Is this considered a big client?"
         "...Naturally!"
         The female manager didn't know what he wanted to do and was a little hesitant. What did he want to do?
         "Then give me a souvenir!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "What?"
         The female manager was confused. What souvenir?
         Where can I find a souvenir for you?
         "Your utensils are very nice. I'm new here, and I might have to move soon ... Give me a set. I'm not the kind of person who takes other people's things. Prepare a set for me and I'll bring it back!"
        
         The female manager was stunned. After a long while, she felt extremely embarrassed. However, she still struggled for a while and nodded."Okay, Governor li, please wait a moment ... I ... I'll have someone prepare it now!"
         She was on the verge of a breakdown!
         There's such a person?
         After she left, hou Xiaochen couldn't help but laugh. Chief Steward Yu's head hurt even more,"Can you stop embarrassing yourself?"
         "Embarrassing?"
         Li Hao was surprised."It's a gift. I didn't steal or Rob it!" I'm a big client, isn't it normal to give me some souvenirs? Chief Yu, I don't like to hear these words. Do you know how much food and water these things can be exchanged for if they are sold? how many people can they feed? You guys ... You're used to being high and mighty, how would you know the suffering of the commoners!"
         Hou Xiaochen was startled, and so was Chief Steward Yu.
         In exchange for ... Food and drinks?
         Serious?
         They looked at Li Hao, who suddenly laughed slyly. "I'm just joking. It feels good to attack you guys from the moral high ground!"
          Chief Steward Yu could not help but laugh.
         Hou Xiaochen, on the other hand, gave Li Hao a deep look, but did not say anything.
         Li Hao also laughed. He laughed and laughed, and then he suddenly stopped laughing and became quiet.
         Chief Steward Yu was confused, surprised, and even a little confused about Li Hao's thoughts.
         You ... What are you thinking?
         Li Hao regained his calm and didn't say anything.
         That's right, Chief Steward Yu did not understand either.
         Although she had left the Taoist world for revenge and killed many people, she was not poor, nor was she an ordinary person. She became a Martial Master and a strong person when she left the Taoist world. Then, she sang all the way and finally joined the night patrol.
         These people ... Were different from him.
         They might not even know that a piece of clothing could be bought!
         They didn't know how much it would cost to eat breakfast or how much it would cost to buy their own ingredients, because they wouldn't have any contact with these things. Li Hao knew that.
         He knew that 1000 star dollars was enough for him to live a decent life.
         He knew that 2000 star coins could allow a family of three to live a well-off life, provided that they were in Silver City or Sky Star City.
         As for face, was it worth anything?
         Li Hao thought to himself.
         Of course, he didn't know before he turned 18.
         When he was 18 years old, he knew everything.
         He laughed in his heart. So you guys aren't all-rounded either. There are some things that you don't know as much as I do.
         When the female manager came with a set of utensils, Li Hao checked them. After confirming that they were the same and made of divine power stones, he was satisfied and put them into his storage ring.
         The female manager couldn't wait to send him away!
         These people, especially Li Hao, made her feel very uncomfortable.
         However, Li Hao was not in a hurry to leave. Instead, he thought for a while and asked,""I have a question. Since you are the broker, how much does it cost to assassinate one of the nine secretaries?"
         “……”
         Silence.
         The female manager was sweating. After a long time, she said,""Governor Li, you must be joking."
         "I'm not joking!"
         Li Hao smiled and said,"how about a million divine energy stones?" Help me assassinate a person ..."
          "That ... We're a restaurant, not a flying organization!"  "Governor Li, you've really misunderstood!" The female manager shook her head hurriedly.
         "I'm serious. "
         "It's a misunderstanding!"
         The female manager was certain. At this moment, she really wanted to kick Li Hao away!
         "Sigh, forget it!"
         Li Hao shook his head. From the looks of it, this person didn't dare to take it. Or rather, he thought that they were unreliable and couldn't take it.
         The group of three people and one dog quickly went downstairs.
         There was almost no one in the hall.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The three people and one dog got into the car. The female manager gave a fake smile as the car started and slowly drove away.
         The female manager only heaved a sigh of relief after he left.
         A moment later, a middle-aged man walked over and said,""How do you feel?"
         "How is it?"
         The female manager ridiculed,"troublesome!" This demonic sword isn't easy to deal with, and it's not easy to deal with either. Especially its ever-changing personality ... It's extremely difficult to deal with!"
         "Even you think it's difficult?" the middle-aged man was surprised.
         "Of course!"
         "Very powerful?"
         "It's not about his strength. Forget it, you won't understand even if I tell you. I'll record it down later and make some corrections to his information."
         "En!"
         The man didn't say anything else and left.
         The female manager heaved a sigh of relief. She had finally sent him away.
         Just as he turned around and was about to enter, his expression suddenly stiffened.
         She didn't know when ... But Li Hao had been standing behind her.
         The female manager's face was extremely stiff!
         When did he get out of the car and come back?
         "Governor li, what are you ..."
         "Come in!"
          Li Hao stood at the door of a room on the first floor and waved his hand with a smile.
         The female manager was on high alert. She thought for a moment, and seeing that there was no one around, she walked over. Li Hao wouldn't dare to do anything here, would he?
         ……
         In the room.
         Li Hao sat down and waited for them to enter. He smiled and said,""I want the information of everyone in the financial division, the strong! And the four Seas business group, the Heavenly Star Douluo arena ... Lower your price. The imperial family and the nine divisions are not on good terms, but I'm here to help you!"
         "Governor Li, you've misunderstood. We're just a restaurant ..."
         Li Hao looked at her in silence for a long time before saying,""You're not selling it to me, right?"
         "That's not what I meant, Governor li. The night patrollers have their own intelligence system ..."
         "Does it have anything to do with me?"
         Li Hao smiled, I want yours! Not only you, I also have other channels to buy some information ... Give me the real one! Even if it's incomplete, it's fine. But if you give me a fake one, I'll tear you apart first! Was the peak of the rising light realm very powerful? Or do you think that the sunguang metamorphosis on the second floor is very powerful? Or did he think that the one at the door was very powerful? Are you not doing business?"
        
         A chuckle came from outside the door,'give it to him! 100,000 divine energy stones!"
         "Is one drop of the spring of life enough?"
         Li Hao laughed, but it has to be worth the price! If it's not worth it ... I, Li Hao, may not be able to do anything to you, but I'm sorry, I happen to know seven or eight lunatics who can unseal their seals. At most, they're equivalent to three or four divine-tier elites. They shouldn't be able to do anything to you ... They'll just play with you!"
         The person outside the door was still laughing."Don't worry, Governor li. It's worth the money!"
         "That's the best!"
         Li Hao laughed and looked at the female manager."Your boss has spoken, so hurry up and do it! You're always so slow. I thought you were pretty and wanted to hire you as my Secretary, but now it seems ... Forget it!"
         The female manager smiled awkwardly.
         You must be joking!
         This guy was really a lunatic!
         She didn't dare to say anything more and quickly left.
          A moment later, he gave Li Hao a jade talisman.""This is an ancient civilization ..."
         "I know!"
         Li Hao said indifferently,"I'm not a bumpkin. I know these things better than you. I've also seen monster plants, demon beasts, and dying generals of the ancient civilization. Have you seen them before?" I've even seen an expert who can blow divine arts to death with a single breath. Have you seen one before? And you're still showing off to me ... Go away!"
         “……”
         The female manager didn't dare to say anything else. She was secretly shocked.
         Is that true?
         It might not ... Be fake!
         After all, Li Hao had once used an origin symbol.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, stayed where he was to check and didn't pay. If he felt that it wasn't worth the price ... He wouldn't pay. As for these people who wanted to take it by force, they could try.
         The other party didn't stop him either. Perhaps he was shocked by Li Hao's words, or he was very confident in his intelligence.
         After a while, Li Hao frowned and said,"are you kidding me?" The Financial Secretary was so powerful that he could only use two people? That's bullshit! The Xu family has a batch of Metamorphoses at their disposal-the four generals, Xu Qing himself, his father's divine-tier, and the red-Bearded Bandit ... And you're telling me that the Liu family can only use two of them?"
         "The Deputy secretaries of the financial division are all official figures and can't be used," the female manager explained. As for the Liu family, they'll definitely have secret guards, but just like the Xu family, they're all in the ruins ... They won't be coming out now. "
         "Only the four Seas group and the star Douluo arena can use them. Of course, we can't rule out the possibility that they'll find a flying assassin, or that they'll use some powerful weapons ... Such as energy bombs."
         Li Hao pondered and nodded,'then, are you guys selling energy bombs? What's the price?"
         "Three hundred thousand divine power stones ..."
         "Hehe!"
         Li Hao sneered. Go Rob!
         You must be joking!
         I can't get so many treasures even if I blow up a Sunglow to transform. Do I think everyone is like Xu Qing?
         He flicked his finger and threw out a drop of the spring of life. "It's barely worth this price, but it's still too expensive! Even killing a metamorphosized beast might not be enough to cover the cost!"
         The female manager smiled apologetically and did not say anything.
         He kept the spring of life and was still a little surprised. This person was really willing to pay this money.
         One had to know that Li Hao had been like a Taotie before.
         This guy was really hard to guess.
         "Oh?" Li Hao stretched and said,"are you in the bodyguard business?"
         "What?"
         "There's no such business for hiring workers during the transformation period?"
         "This ... I really don't have any ... But there might be people willing to do the early stages of sunguang, but the price isn't low ..."
         "Then forget it, he's too weak!"  The female manager was speechless and didn't say anything else. Was Xuguang also weak?
         Wasn't li Hao also at the rising light rank?
         Seeing that Li Hao was still not leaving after the deal was done, the female manager's head hurt even more."Governor li ... Is there anything else?"
         "A big client! You don't understand?"
         “……”
         艹!
         This female manager who had received countless people almost never lost her temper, but at this moment, she was cursing in her heart.
         Have some shame!
         A set of cutlery was really not cheap.
         They were all made of divine power stones, and they were of the highest quality. One set would cost at least 2000 divine power stones ... Yet, this fellow had the nerve to ask for it again and again.
         She was cursing in her heart, but after thinking about it, she still went to get it.
         Forget it!
         A drop of the spring of life was considered a big customer. It was worth a lot of money. So be it. He would just send this God of plague away.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Soon, another set of cutlery was sent over.
         Li Hao was finally satisfied!
         A drop of the spring of life was ten thousand divine energy stones for one drop. He had taken two sets of tableware, which were worth four to five thousand Yuan. In addition, he had a big meal ... In fact, the loss was not too big.
         Before he left, he sucked at the divine power Stone at the door again!
         This time, the bright divine power Stone at the door dimmed. Li Hao then left.
         After he left, the female manager was on the verge of a mental breakdown. She was a little suspicious, afraid that Li Hao would appear behind her again. Fortunately, there was really no one this time!
         In the end, not long after, the waiter upstairs told her that the large private room that Li Hao had just used was empty ... But all the items made of divine power stones had become empty decorations!
         All the energy was gone!
         At this moment, the female manager finally couldn't help but curse,""You're really not a thing!"
         ……
         Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't know. Even if he did, he would feel wronged.
         He didn't do it!
         It was all the Black Panther's doing. A Black Panther's absorption ability was very strong. While Li Hao and the others were eating, the Black Panther was playing. As it played, it absorbed all the energy in the private room. Li Hao wasn't going to take the blame.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had yet to return to the Nightwalker headquarters.
         Under the night sky, he was wearing a top hat and holding a scepter. He was in calling mode."Commander of the southern Fist company, please reply if you receive this!"
          ……
         In the Imperial Palace.
         Nan Quan instantly jumped up and couldn't help but curse,"“艹! I'm here, and you're in trouble. When I was cultivating earlier, you were faster than anyone else ... You bastard ..."
         Li Hao only contacted him after he received the message. Was he asking him to fight?
         I'm afraid of death!
         He did not dare to fight with the Financial Secretary.
         But ... He still couldn't resist the temptation of the sword energy. After struggling for a while, he replied,""Where are you?"
         "I'll be waiting for you at the entrance of the nine Dragon Pavilion. Martial uncle Nan Quan, I missed you!"
         “……”
         Nan Quan was silent for a moment, then let out a long curse and started to walk out. Li Hao, be a human!
        
         He had not seen Nanquan for a long time and missed him.
         When he saw the southern Fist again, the smile on Li Hao's face was so big that it was almost like a flower.
         "Good evening, martial uncle!"
         If there's nothing, it's martial uncle. If there's nothing, it's soldier Southern Fist.
         Nan Quan cursed in his heart.
         His beard was scrunched up, and he sneered,""You're quite bold!"
         He didn't come to stellarsky city earlier, but now that he was here, this brat was getting more and more insolent!
         "It has nothing to do with courage,"
         Li Hao smiled brightly."However, as a Silver Moon Martial Master, I should travel the world with my sword and pursue the path of the older martial masters. I should sweep away the extraordinary people in the world and spread the name of a Silver Moon Martial Master!"
         "You're not small either!"
          Nan Quan looked around."In the nine Dragons Pavilion, at the end of Jiu si Street, outside the palace, those who dare to say such things will not end well."
         Li Hao was unconcerned." 80 years ago, the royal family thought the same way. Today, there are nine divisions surrounding us. Uncle-master, nothing is impossible in this world."
         Southern Fist laughed.
         He could be considered arrogant, but of course, there was shrewdness in his arrogance.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to be a cautious person.
         But today, there was a huge change.
         Nan Quan didn't know if it was because of the improvement in his strength that caused this guy to change so much or if it was some other reason, but he didn't care.
         This tone ... Was in line with the Silver Moon Martial master's personality.
         "Shall we find a place to have a drink?"
         "Alright!"
         Li Hao nodded. He had just been drinking tea with hou Xiaochen, so when Nan Quan said "drink a cup," he naturally meant "drink."
         Not bad.
         Nan Quan didn't say anything and said as he walked,""You look terrible in these clothes! Besides, you're too big of a target. Everyone knows that you're dressed weirdly. Do you want to be seen wherever you go?"
         Li Hao laughed. Without saying anything, he waved his hand, and the eye-catching hat disappeared.
         The scepter in his hand also turned into a bracelet and wrapped around his hand.
         "You've mastered it?"
         Nanquan was a little surprised. Was this a refinement?
         "No, I haven 't."
         Li Hao shook his head. It was just that after absorbing the soldier soul, he was easier to control and had mastered some basic abilities.
         "Where's Heibao?"
         "Woof!"
         As soon as he finished asking, a little puppy in the corner barked. Nan Quan frowned slightly and said after a long while,""This dog ... If I don't tell anyone, no one will believe that it's the Golden hunting dog on the priest ranking."
         "God tier master ranking?"
         "You didn't see it?"
         "No, I didn 't,"
         "You can take a look. Although it might not be accurate, you can roughly know who are the powerhouses under the age of 30 in the central region."  "I'm not interested,"
         "What?"
         "I've long passed this period. "
         Li Hao calmly pointed forward.""My current targets are these people. The secretaries of the nine divisions, the old secretaries, the old antiques, the survivors of the ancient civilization ... Even if my current strength is not as good as theirs, my ambition is higher than the sky! As for whether my life will be thinner than paper ... It'll depend on my luck! If you don't have a high heart, you can't go far. I want to go further!"
         Nan Quan was extremely surprised and looked at Li Hao again.
         It had actually only been a month since they parted ways at Silver Moon.
         But Li Hao had changed a lot.
         Perhaps it was because he had led his men to kill Xu Qing, or perhaps it was because he had seen more things, but Nan Quan knew that Li Hao had actually done a lot of great things after he left.
         When he left, Li Hao could only deal with those at the mid-stage of the rising light realm.
         But now ... Li Hao had even killed a metahuman. Even if there were many coincidences, he was still a metahuman.
         In a short month, Li Hao had experienced the battle of white shark, the Battle of the North Sea, and the battle to determine the border ...
         In three large-scale battles, many of Xu Guang's men were killed.
         As a Silver Moon Martial Master, these three battles were earth-shaking changes for Li Hao. The southern Fist no longer had much of an advantage over Li Hao.
         If he didn't unseal himself, he wouldn't even be Li Hao's match.
         In the case of unsealing, he was only slightly better than the transformation. As for the sacred art ... It was not as good.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Back at the Cang mountains, when he was unsealed, he could only suppress one great demon. He wasn't like Hong Yitang, who suppressed many great demons.
         "It's a good thing to be arrogant!"
         Nanquan nodded, less resentful, and smiled.""You can't go far if you don't have high aspirations. However, you can't be too ambitious. Stellarsky city isn't ordinary."
         "I understand."
         The two of them walked at a fast pace.
         It was not until they walked out of Jiusi Street that they heard the noise. This was a city that never slept, but Jiusi was quiet and the lights were dim, just like the dynasty itself.
         Bright on the outside, dark on the inside.
         "There's an old tavern up ahead. The wine there is pretty good. I go there often."
         Nan Quan chuckled and said as he walked,""It's a pity that you were unwilling to come with me the last time, so you missed a chance. Otherwise ..."
         "A chance?"
          "Martial uncle, you're stronger than before?" Li Hao glanced at Southern Fist.
         "It's difficult!"
         "No." Nan Quan shook his head and sighed."It's hard to replenish vitality, but it's still a small improvement."
         "What is an opportunity?"
         Nan Quan thought for a moment and said,""An opportunity for the royal family. I suspect that the royal family does have the ruins of the Heavenly Star Town, but they haven't finished exploring it. The royal family will organize people to explore it every year ... I'm a Martial Master, and I can protect some princes and princesses. Sometimes, I'm also allowed to enter ..."
         "Would you let martial uncle participate in such a confidential matter?"
         Li Hao was a little confused.
         The imperial family seemed to value the southern Fist.
         Why?
         Even silver Moon martial masters weren't well-liked, but it wasn't easy for the imperial family to cultivate the southern style to such a level.
        
         Under normal circumstances, an outsider like Nanquan wouldn't be allowed to participate in this kind of remains.
         "What's the big deal? everything in the world is for profit!"
         Nan Quan didn't think much of it. " 20 years ago, I sought refuge with the weakest and weakest Prince." When he was in trouble, I strongly supported him and even blocked a few assassinations for him. Now that the other party has become stronger and more powerful, as one of the earliest investors, whether it's true gratitude or just a simple investment ... He will not treat me badly. "
         That's amazing!
         "Senior uncle, you have good eyes," Li Hao said with emotion.
         "What foresight? it's just looking for the weakest investment. If we can win, we'll win big. If we lose, we'll run. It's also his ability that he can rise up. "
         "That's right!" Li Hao nodded and asked curiously,"the royal family is already like this, and there's still internal strife?"
         It was obvious that the assassination of the weakest Prince did not come from the nine divisions.
         Why kill the weakest one?
         It was definitely caused by internal strife.
          "If the imperial family doesn't have internal strife, what has the nine divisions got to do with it?"
         Nan Quan laughed."Didn't Jiusi also have a chance because of the internal strife in the royal family? otherwise, the black armored Army was extremely powerful at that time. How could Jiusi have had a chance?" The royal family was ruthless. For the Heavenly Star throne, they would fight even more ruthlessly than outsiders! Not to mention the throne, just the throne of the nine Kings, the position of Duke of the thirty-six Dukes ... Which family doesn't fight until their heads are bleeding?"
         "It's better these years. I know that the royal family is in danger, and the conflicts have lessened. If it were 20 years ago, there would be no nine divisions. Just these people in the royal family can cause chaos in the world."
         There were struggles everywhere.
         Li Hao nodded, feeling that he had gained more knowledge. He had thought that the royal family must be working together to get rid of the nine divisions 'control at this time. However, it turned out that this was not the case, even if the royal family was still struggling.
         "Is the Prince you're supporting very strong now?"
         "It's alright, about the same as you. "
         Nan Quan chuckled."The royal family actually has a lot of resources and opportunities. Don't think that they can't go out. In fact, they can. The nine divisions only limits power, not a person. Besides, if they really want to go out ... The nine divisions can't stop them, unless they start a war now. The key is that the imperial family can enter the ruins without going out. "
         “……”
         The two of them chatted as they walked. Not long after, they stopped in a small alley. The small Tavern was a real small Tavern. It was just in the small alley. Even though it was extremely noisy outside, there were not many people here.
         Nan Quan walked in casually. The tavern owner, who was originally dozing off, opened his eyes and saw Nan Quan. He instantly stood up and quickly said,""Boss he is here ..."
         "Old rules?" he glanced at Li Hao and asked.
         "Mm, one more is good!"
         "Alright, I'll arrange it immediately."
         The boss hurried to the backstage. There was not even a waiter. It seemed that he had finished everything by himself.
         The two of them sat down. Nan Quan stretched out his hand and a jar of wine not far away fell into his hand. He then stretched out his hand and two large bowls appeared. He smiled and said, "Don't look at how there are few people here. In fact, this place is the real old taste. The city area is bigger, but the taste is really not that good."  "Come, let's have a drink!"
         Then, he poured a cup for Li Hao.
         Li Hao took a sip and clicked his tongue. The best taste was strong. As soon as the wine entered his stomach, he felt as if it was burning.
         For the southern Fist, strong wine might be the best wine.
         However, when the strong wine exploded in his stomach, he had a different feeling.
         Nan Quan didn't stand on ceremony and continued to shout,"Tell me, what's your purpose in looking for me? To deal with the Financial Secretary? To deal with the Heavenly Star Douluo arena? That's hou Xiaochen's goal, not yours. What do you think?"
         In person?
         Li Hao pondered for a while before saying,""I don't have any ideas. In fact, I don't have a big goal. Before I came here, I wanted to find trouble with the Crimson Moon, but on the way, I changed my mind ... I want to see whether the center of the dynasty is black or white, and whether there will be a day of light in this world."
         "How can you learn from Hong Yitang!"
         Nan Quan was speechless,'then let me tell you, all crows in this world are black! The stellarsky city is even darker. In places you can't see, many people die every day. Snakes, insects, rats, and ants are all gathered here. "
         Li Hao chuckled, took a sip of wine, and exhaled.""I'm not copying martial uncle Hong. I just feel that as a Martial Master, as a transcendent, as an official ... There are things to do and things not to do! Take the star Douluo arena for example. I actually don't care about sparring and fighting to the death ..."
         Southern Fist listened quietly.
         "I just wanted to take a look."
         "What are you looking at?"
         Nan Quan looked at him,"what can you see?" What can you do? It's not that I'm trying to put you down, but you're just asking for trouble by getting involved in this. "
          "I don't care,"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com p Li Hao continued to drink, his face beaming.""Uncle-master, do you still remember the heaven-battling Army?"  Southern Fist was stunned.
         "Do you think the heaven battling Army is willing to protect this group of people in Heavenly Star City?"
         “……”
         There was silence.
         Nan Quan also started to drink. He frowned and thought about something.
         After a long time, he said,"these great truths and great ambitions are actually too far away for me. I'm not interested! Of course, it was also a Martial master's dream to fight in the martial world when he saw injustice. Just tell me what you're going to do, what you're going to do, and how far you'll go ... That's enough. "
         Li Hao couldn't help but laugh!
         "How much help can uncle-master provide me?" he asked after a while.
        
         Nan Quan glanced at Li Hao, feeling a headache coming on.""How much help do you want?"
         "Use a few divine abilities."
         “……”
         Go to hell!
         Nanquan cursed helplessly. This kid only knew how to talk nonsense.
         He pondered for a while and said,"I've been in Tian Xing city for 20 years, but I can only say that I have a small network. I'll get you two Xu Guangs, and with me, three ... They're all reliable and can do anything. However, you have to pay and the price is right. It's easy to talk about!"
         "What's Xuguang's realm?"
         "One is in the late stage, and the other is in the peak stage."
         Li Hao frowned slightly and glanced at Nan Quan. Nan Quan also rolled his eyes."Why, do you think I'm weak?"
         He felt that Li Hao had gone crazy.
          Li Hao nodded.
         "Do you think the transformation stage is everywhere?"
         He couldn't help but complain,"you've seen a lot because the people you've provoked are not right. They're either from the nine divisions, the high Duke's public house, the Prince's Mansion, or the governor. Go and see for yourself. How many transformation stages are there in the world?"
         What kind of people had Li Hao provoked?
         The three major organizations were the Pingyuan Palace, the Linjiang governor's mansion, the dingguo's mansion, and the financial division ...
         Which one of these forces wasn't famous in the world?
         In reality, the rising light realm was a top-notch expert.
         But in Li Hao's eyes, it seemed to have become a thing of the past. But in fact, even a Martial Master like Southern Fist was still at this level.
         "It's better than nothing!"Li Hao sighed.
         Nan Quan's face darkened.
         It's better than nothing!
         One of them was at the peak stage while the other was at the late stage.
         "Are you on good terms with martial uncle?"
         "It's good,"
         Nan Quan didn't continue to argue and nodded.""I don't have a good personality. If I can't make friends, I can make good friends. They're similar to me, they're quite bold, and they're not satisfied with the status quo ... They're willing to take risks even if there's benefits ..."
         "Will you deal with me? My benefits are greater than dealing with the financial division, but the danger is smaller. "
         Nan Quan was stunned for a moment. He touched his chin and laughed after a while."You don't say ... It's possible! How about this, I'll go ask them. If they don't agree, then forget it, but if they did, they wouldn't do such a thing. "
         Li Hao was also speechless.
         "If uncle-master is completely unsealed now, what stage is he at?"  "It's not as good as divine abilities. "
         "Let's put it this way," Nan Quan could only say."For us, the main thing is to see how many locks are unlocked. At this time, we have to see how many locks are unlocked and how saturated they are ... It's hard to say when a Martial Master has reached this stage. Everyone's situation is different ..."
         "The transformation stage of the rising light realm is actually a very long process. Do you know what the transformation stage is?"
         Li Hao shook his head.
         "During the metamorphosis stage, those who have broken the Super Lock on one of their five organs and the Super Lock on all four limbs are known as the rising light. Breaking the sixth, which is the second superpower lock of the five organs, he is the real God art ..."
         "As for the transformation stage, why are you talking about it separately?"
         He looked at Li Hao and explained,""The transformation stage is actually a process of breaking in. The second type of power is released bit by bit. It won't break at once, but will explode instantly! It's similar to how we unseal ourselves. They also break the second superpower lock in their organs bit by bit and release the power in the lock bit by bit ... When it's completely broken, the other party will have god art. "Before that, you'll have to enter the process of collapse. That's the beginning of the transformation."
         Li Hao finally understood!
         So it was like this.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "There are also strong and weak stages in the metamorphosis stage. For example, one-tenth of the seal is broken, one-fifth of the seal is broken ... In fact, it is somewhat similar to us unsealing."
         "Be it Xu Qing, Hong Yitang, or even me, all of us are in this state. As for me ... After I've been unsealed, I can't reach the level of a divine power. However, Hong Yitang has been completely unsealed, so he's definitely not weaker than a divine power."
         Li Hao thought to himself. After a moment, he said,""What if uncle-master adds a few more super locks?"
         Nan Quan's expression changed. He looked at Li Hao, rubbed his chin, and suddenly revealed a bright smile. "That's another matter. If it's possible, I can beat up whoever you want and kill whoever you want to kill. But is it too late?"
         "Why not?" he asked.
         "Aren't you going to ..."
         Before he could finish, Li Hao laughed,"what are you doing tomorrow?" Everyone thought that I would listen to Minister hou and go find trouble tomorrow ... So I must go tomorrow? I don't want to, I want to go into seclusion for a few days, can't I?"
         Nanquan was stunned. This works too?
         Oh, that's great!
          Li Hao's eyes flickered."Your two friends, if you're willing ... I'll pay you in advance. What do you need to enter the transformation stage at the peak of the rising light Stage?" Energy? Sword energy? Or the five elements? Or something else? I'll pay! I'll just treat it as hiring a bodyguard!"
         Nan Quan looked at him for a long time before he grinned,""You're good!"
         Everyone thought that since hou Xiaochen had declared war tonight, Li Hao would show up tomorrow.
         Good Lord, he said he was going into seclusion.
         This ... Was really unexpected.
         The financial division had made preparations, but Li Hao had run away. Where could they go to reason?
         "Alright ... Where do you want to go?"
         "Three days should be enough for the Stardust sea."
         Li Hao's smile was brilliant."It's better to benefit uncle than outsiders, right?" If we're fully prepared, we'll become famous and rich immediately. The benefits of the Heavenly Star Douluo arena will probably be quite substantial ..."
         After saying that, Li Hao pondered for a while and said,""Besides, we don't have to keep an eye on the star Douluo arena ... Can you find evidence of the four Seas group colluding with the Pirates? As long as we have it ... We'll go to the SI hai organization first!"
        
         Nanquan inhaled and inhaled again.
         After a while, he glanced at Li Hao."You're a ruthless man!"
         Li Hao chuckled."What are you saying, uncle? the four Seas group might not be poorer than the star Douluo arena. They might even be richer. The key is ... They're most likely colluding with Pirates!"
         Li Hao sneered."How can the four Seas group travel across the sea so smoothly without colluding with Pirates?" he asked.
         Even a fool would know that the two sides had a tacit understanding and were even in cahoots.
         It was more likely that the SI Hai Group was also involved in the pirate business in secret.
         Otherwise, the profits of a normal merchant would not be as great as that of a pirate. A business without capital was the real profit.
         Nan Quan looked at Li Hao for a while and didn't speak for a long time. Li Hao continued,""Because the SI Hai Group has to travel across the four Seas, its headquarters is near the star sea. The star sea can also be directly connected to the four Seas, but the sea area is blocked, and no one is allowed to enter or leave."
         "Their boss is now Wu Yong. I've met him once. He's in the transformation stage ... But there's a high chance that he's still in Tian Xing city ... But without evidence, it's not right to directly touch the Financial Secretary ... As long as there's evidence, I have the right to directly touch them!"
         "The SI Hai Group has been in the four Seas for so many years. Even if most of its wealth has to be handed over to the financial division, and a part of it is in the hands of Wu Yong, it does not belong to him alone ... If we confiscate the SI Hai Group, we will definitely be rich!"
          Nan Quan smiled and nodded.
         At this moment, the dishes were served.
         The owner of the bar ran to the side and continued to doze off after serving the dishes.
         Li Hao and Nan Quan were eating and drinking.
         After a while, Southern Fist spoke."Then I'll contact those two guys first. If it's possible ... We can go together. If not, just the two of us."
         "Alright!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything, and Southern Fist didn't contact him. Instead, he told Li Hao to wait for a while before he ran out.
         Li Hao didn't know if he had used a communication device or some other special method.
         After nearly half an hour, Nan Quan finally returned with a smile and nodded.""Done! The two fellows were very excited when they heard this! However, there are also requirements. After the matter is over, you have to join the inspection Division or the night patrol. "
         "What?"
         "To save my life."
         "You didn't directly wipe out the financial division. You may not be afraid, but they are. It's easy for them to retaliate after the matter." I'm different, I'll just be in name, but they're both unspecialized, so I'll have to let them join after the event ... The kind that doesn't do anything, in the form of guest Masters, is that okay?"
         "Yes, right now. The Heavenly Star military governor's office is going to be built, and I'm the Deputy Governor. I just want a name. Anything below the rank of first class patrol officer, I can make any decision. Even patrol envoy is fine ... It's nothing more than two more tokens."
         "Now that I'm an official, my confidence is different!"
         Nan Quan laughed and transmitted his voice."I'll have them go to the stellarsky sea first ... When we're done, you can go first. I'll go after you. You can contact me with your armor."
         "Alright," he said.
         Li Hao didn't say much. He chatted with Southern Fist for a while and then quickly left.
         ……
         He didn't take a car and hid in the darkness.
         Li Hao went straight out of stellarsky city.
         Not long after, the southern Fist also disappeared.
         The sky was also gradually starting to brighten.
         That night, the higher-ups of the stellarsky city couldn't fall asleep. They were all waiting for something, waiting for the dawn to come.
         ……
          At the night patrollers 'headquarters.  Hou Xiaochen had not gone to sleep either. At this moment, gold spear, wood forest, and Jade manager were all waiting in the office.
         After a long while, hou Xiaochen let out a breath and couldn't help but laugh,"Li Hao ... You're really something!"
         Motherf * cker!
         Chief Steward Yu was also speechless and had a headache."The Minister has just launched an attack on the financial division. Is he lost?"
         Li Hao had said that he had something to do and would be back soon.
         But, where was he?
         No more!
         This was what he meant by "willing to charge into the enemy lines" for hou Xiaochen?
         I ... F * ck!
         Don't tell me he ran away?
         Mu Lin also said carefully,"Li Hao ... Could he have run away?" He ran away with the dog that night ..."
         They didn't think that way. More importantly, they had agreed to fight today, but Li Hao had disappeared.
         This ... One couldn't help but make the Association.
         "If he's gone ... I'll bring my men to the Heavenly Star Douluo arena. Otherwise ..." Jin Jin sighed.
         Otherwise, hou Xiaochen wouldn't be able to step down.
         Not only would it not do any good, but it would also directly offend the Financial Secretary.
         Hou Xiaochen chuckled,"forget it, if that guy really runs away ... Unless I do it myself, even Xiao Yu won't be able to do anything. Sigh!" Forget it!"
         He was slightly helpless.
         Didn't you agree to it last night?
         If you didn't come, I wouldn't be in a hurry to declare war.
         In the end, you declared war, but you were gone. He could imagine that when the news of Li Hao's disappearance spread today ... He, hou Xiaochen, would probably become the biggest laughing stock in stellarsky city.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It really made him feel helpless!
         "Could he be impersonating someone like before and have already gone to the Heavenly Star Douluo arena?" Chief Steward Yu said after some thought.
          "It's not impossible. "
         Hou Xiaochen nodded and smiled,"let's just say that!" Forget it, everyone should go and rest. "
         He did not say anything else.
         ……
         And at this moment.
         At the night patrollers 'headquarters.
         "Hehe!" Huang Long sneered,"Li Hao actually disappeared ... And didn't return?"
         "No, I didn 't,"
         "He couldn't have entered the Heavenly Star Douluo arena, could he?"
         Huang Long thought about it and sneered,"He thinks this is the East? After the first time, you still want to hide your identity for the second time?"
