        Chapter 171: Dual cultivation (1)
?

“Pfft!”

He spat out another mouthful of blood.

Li Hao opened his eyes in a daze. He was still using the five animals breathing technique, and the violent movements in his body gradually calmed down.

However, the red energy was still pouring in. Li Hao even felt that all the meridians in his body were blocked by the energy. It even felt like they were solidifying. There was no pain, only numbness!

It was as if his body did not belong to him anymore!

“You’re awake?”

The teacher’s voice rang in his ears.

Li Hao opened his eyes, looking tired. He saw his teacher walking a dog. The dog was a Black Panther.


“Teacher!”

Li Hao coughed and spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood was slightly black.

Yuan Shuo was also very tired, but he had stayed by Li Hao’s side for the whole day. Seeing that Li Hao had finally woken up and regained his will, Yuan Shuo didn’t bother to say anything. He directly snatched the small sword away like a bandit.

“Absorb!”

Li Hao was speechless. His teacher’s actions ... Didn’t match his status as a great scholar!

“Teacher, I ...”

“I know, I’ve checked. There’s too much energy in your body, but it’s maintained in a balanced state, so you won’t die for the time being ... If you don’t let me absorb it, you’ll be able to collect my corpse later!”

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

Yuan Shuo said jokingly, but the situation was actually quite serious.

If he wasn’t afraid that he would be killed by the energy impact if he snatched the small sword, he would have done so long ago.

Only his own student would be able to wait until now. If it was someone else, would he, Yuan Shuo, have waited until now?

His body was in a mess right now!

He was even more confused than Li Hao. Li Hao had only used his energy to attack, but he had used up all his energy and internal strength. In addition, his divine will had also been damaged.

It was a spiritual attack.

The “bloodblade technique” was worthy of being a forbidden martial art. This was the first time Yuan Shuo personally experienced the power of this martial art. Of course, a martial art like the “bloodblade technique” had nothing to do with Li Hao.

Since it involved the use of spiritual energy, Li Hao had to wait until he reached the Qian combat level. Although this forbidden martial art was powerful, it wasn’t something that ordinary people could use, and the person who used it couldn’t afford the price.

He absorbed some of the Jade sword’s energy ...

In an instant, the injuries in his body were slightly healed, and Yuan Shuo could not help but groan.

Cool!

It felt exceptionally good!

The feeling of rain after a long drought was really comfortable. If he had worn this small sword before, he might have been able to use the blood saber art again. The weapons of the eight great families were more powerful than he had imagined.

That included the stone blade. If it wasn’t for the stone blade, he wouldn’t have been able to break through that guy’s defense with his Qian warrior level.

To be able to kill Divine Master Duan Tian, the stone blade and the blood Blade technique were both indispensable.

He was lucky to have defeated his opponent this time.

“Teacher!”

Li Hao looked at Yuan Shuo. At this moment, Yuan Shuo was in a sorry state, and it didn’t seem like he was pretending. There was no one around, so there was no point in pretending.

“Did we win?”

“We won!”

As Yuan Shuo absorbed the energy, he cursed,””Red Moon is really ruthless! To deal with an ordinary person, they had to send a top-tier three Sun Expert. They were really F * cking willing ... Fortunately, I killed him!”

Three yang?

Li Hao couldn’t move at the moment. He could only lean against the dirty wall and ask,””Three yang ... Above the brilliant sun?”

“Yes, that’s the guy!”
Yuan Shuo sucked on it comfortably and felt his injuries recovering. His mood was much better.”Above the radiant sun, gather the power of the three yang, taking the meaning of the three Yang as one. It means that the total amount of mysterious energy of a super is almost three radiant sun levels, and they are a powerhouse of the three yang!”

“I originally thought that even if the person behind the scenes had some tricks up his sleeve, supers had only appeared for 20 years. There are very few three-sun level existences in Silver Moon province, and there are more in the central region. The other party sent a sunlit expert, and it’s already considered that they think highly of you ... Good Lord, a three-Sun Expert directly came!”

This time, it was really dangerous.

If it wasn’t for the stone blade, if it wasn’t for Yuan Shuo’s advancement and the countless ancient books he could use, a three sun realm existence would be able to easily kill all of them. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to sweep through the entire Silver City.

Li Hao also sighed.

Yes, you really think highly of me!

The more this was the case, the more it proved that the trouble ... Might not be over!

For an ordinary person like him, the other party had actually dispatched an existence of this level. Now that he had been killed by his teacher, what about the next time?

“Teacher, how did you kill that guy? You’ve broken through?”

“No!”

Yuan Shuo suddenly frowned and shook his head,””It’s not that simple. Let’s not talk about superpowers. As for the martial masters, they’re above thousand-hands ... There’s no way out!”

There was no way out!

Li Hao was a little stunned.”Then teacher can just become a super. Do you think you don’t have enough sabers?”

“That’s not the reason. I won’t tell you for now. As for you ... Let’s talk about it after you break through 100. There’s still a long way ahead.”

He didn’t want to say anything at the moment, for it would only disturb Li Hao.

He continued,”of course, your current situation ... Even I can’t understand it!” What did you absorb? the blood in your body is almost solidified. It’s all energy and not mysterious energy. ”

Li Hao thought for a moment and explained,”it’s the spiritual-level thing that I mentioned. It entered my body and was injured by my small sword. Then, a large amount of energy rushed into my body and combined with the sword energy in my body, forming a special energy ... I’ve absorbed it before, but it’s not much. It’s because of the powerful blood. Now, I’ve absorbed too much, and I’m having indigestion!”

Chapter 172: Dual cultivation (2)
“Definitely!”

Yuan Shuo nodded.”I’m well aware of your physical fitness. You’re not weak among the ten slash realm. But the energy you’re absorbing ... I’m afraid it’s beyond the level of a thousand-man warrior!” There’s too much of it. The reason why you didn’t explode is because of the sword energy! It neutralizes your power, but it also puts you in a difficult situation. ”

Li Hao also tried to digest the energy, only to find that he was helpless. It really seemed to have solidified!

What should he do?

Yuan Shuo’s injuries had mostly recovered. Seeing Li Hao trying to absorb the energy, he shook his head and said,””You absorbed too much energy unconsciously in your sleep, and it’s already solidified! I’m afraid it’s difficult for you to absorb it on your own!”

Li Hao frowned.

He looked at his teacher. He felt that his teacher should have a way.

In his eyes, Yuan Shuo seemed to be omniscient. Even though he might be overestimating his teacher, it had been the case since the very beginning. There was nothing that he, Li Shuo, did not know, and his teacher seemed to be well aware of.

Any problem raised could be solved by a teacher.


Yuan Shuo continued.”I don’t know if you’re going to face even more trouble from now on ... But you’re the only successor of the Silver City’s eight great families. The red moon organization has failed to achieve their goal, and they’ve also lost a top powerhouse of the three suns realm. I’m afraid they won’t let this matter rest so easily!”

“Of course, because I’m here, they can’t figure out my situation and don’t dare to rashly make a move again ... Besides, I’ve killed a powerhouse of the three suns realm this time. If the other party comes again, I’m afraid there will be more than one three suns. After all, the night watchers still exist and are still Orthodox. I’m also the nominal cooperative professor of the night watchers ... In any case, they shouldn’t dare to rashly make a move for a short time.”

On one hand, Yuan Shuo wanted Li Hao to understand that his problem had yet to be solved.

On the other hand, she was also appeasing them. There wasn’t a big problem, and nothing would happen for the time being. Although the night patrollers were weak, as long as they held their ground, Hongyue wouldn’t dare to rashly move out unless they turned out in full force. That would be the final battle, and Ying Hongyue didn’t have the courage to do so.

“As for your problem, it’s easy to solve it.”

Li Hao’s eyes lit up. He knew that his teacher had a way.

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

“Two ways!”

Yuan Shuo stretched out two fingers and smiled,””First, cut off your flesh and let out your blood!”

“……”

Li Hao was embarrassed. This ... Of course, if there was no other way, it wasn’t impossible to solve the problem. But cutting his own flesh and letting out his blood ... It sounded painful.

“Second, dual cultivation!”

“What?”

Li Hao wasn’t completely clueless. Hearing this, he immediately said,””Find a girl?”

.

“Get lost!”

“Don’t think of such crooked things when dual cultivation is mentioned!”Yuan Shuo snapped. What was he thinking about at such a young age! Dual cultivation was just a way of cultivation. Don’t f * cking think about it! I mean, with me ...”

Li Hao opened his mouth wide!

“What’s the matter?”Yuan Shuo chuckled. Not willing? What’s wrong with letting your teacher, me, take advantage of you? You’ve absorbed too much energy and can’t consume it. Ordinary people can’t solve this problem. We’re both from the same sect, and your root technique is the breathing technique of five birds. So am I. If we dual cultivate, with my strength, I can help you consume more than half of your energy ... Of course, if that’s the case, you’ll lose out. The energy you’ve absorbed with great difficulty will be snatched away by me!”

“There’s actually another way ...”

Yuan Shuo said slowly,”the third method is to wait!” With your situation, I think you can finish absorbing it within one or two years. After you finish absorbing it, you may reach the peak of the 100th level or even the thousand warrior level ... Of course, the hope is not big. The thousand warrior level mainly depends on the divine intent, which is just energy, but the peak of the 100th level is a hundred percent!”

As long as Li Hao was willing to wait, he should be able to absorb all this energy in one or two years and become a peak-stage Martial Master with a cultivation base of over 100. Countless people would be envious of such a speed.

It really wasn’t a long time.

However, Yuan Shuo did not say this immediately, because he knew that Li Hao might not have the time to wait in peace.

The energy couldn’t be absorbed, and the blood in Li Hao’s meridians solidified. Even if Li Hao didn’t die, he would probably have to stay in bed and be a patient for the next one or two years.

“If you dual cultivate with me now, I’ll absorb most of the power, and you’ll only be able to absorb a small part. Although you’ll still be able to improve a lot, it won’t be a problem for you to reach the peak of the tenth level, but breaking through the hundred level ... It’ll be a little difficult!”

“Tell me, what do you think?” Yuan Shuo looked at him with a smile.

“Also, I forgot to mention that the first method is to cut off one’s flesh and let out one’s blood to loosen the energy. In fact, you can also absorb a part of it. Perhaps you can absorb more than dual cultivation with me. Perhaps you can break through the 100-level!”

Of the three options, dual cultivation was the least beneficial for Li Hao.

This was because Yuan Shuo was too strong!

If he joined in, most of the energy would be absorbed by him.

“Teacher, can I choose the fourth option?” Li Hao asked after some consideration.

“What?”

Where did the fourth come from?

Yuan Shuo looked at him with some doubt. ‘You have more tricks up your sleeve than me?’

Li Hao said embarrassedly,”I remember, teacher. You said that we have a Senior Sister. She’s in white moon City now. Does she know the breathing technique of five birds?” How about ...”

“Get lost!”

Yuan Shuo was speechless!

You’re dreaming!

“Besides, where are we going to find your Senior Sister at this time? who knows how many people are watching us. We should keep a low profile and treat our injuries first. As for your Senior Sister ...”

At the thought of this, Yuan Shuo touched his beardless chin and said,””Don’t even think about your Senior Sister! Besides, your Senior Sister is already over thirty years old, she’s old and yellow, but you’re still young, you really don’t mind eating meat or vegetables!”

Chapter 173: Dual cultivation (3)
“……”

Li Hao was speechless. He shook his head and smiled.”Dual cultivation ... Forget it, let’s not talk about dual cultivation. Teacher, I feel uncomfortable hearing it! Please change the term, I’ll choose this!”

“You’re sure?”

“Of course!”

Li Hao chuckled,”teacher, becoming strong is the capital for me to live on!” Just like this time, if it wasn’t for teacher’s help, I would have long been burnt to ashes!”

He didn’t even consider it, but he felt a little uncomfortable hearing about dual cultivation.

Of course, he had chosen to share the energy with Yuan Shuo. If that was the case, he would benefit, and so would his teacher.

A win-win situation!

Otherwise, so what if he really reached the peak of breaking a hundred?


The other party started with a Wang bomb!

The first thing he did was to be attacked by a top-notch expert at the level of three suns, which was two levels higher than breaking 100. Without Yuan Shuo’s protection, how could Li Hao play?

Yuan Shuo laughed,”I know you’re not stupid!” I said I’ll give you three choices, but there’s actually only one ... Even if you don’t dual cultivate, you still have to do it. I’m so thirsty right now! I can’t even use my inner strength. If you weren’t my student, I would have sucked you dry while you were asleep!”

“……”

Li Hao smiled bitterly.”Teacher, we’re on the side of justice. Your behavior makes me feel that we’re the bad guys!”

“Nonsense justice!”

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

“That’s right!” Yuan Shuo replied nonchalantly,”twenty years ago, martial masters were rampant. I, your master, used my Iron Fists to sweep through the world and kill countless people! Everyone calls me old demon Yuan! To put it bluntly, call me an ape. I major in the five birds technique and am fast, so it’s not wrong to call me that!”

In any case, it just didn’t have a nice title.

Whatever Silvermoon three spear strikes, that had nothing to do with him. He was the old devil.

It was only because of the rise of the supers that he kept a low profile.

“Cut the crap. Hurry up and dual cultivate. You’ve been lying in bed for a whole day ... Everything is fine in Blizzard Silver City now, and the night patrol has also reacted. The red moon probably won’t dare to rashly send people here again. We have to hurry back!”

“In such a hurry?”

Li Hao, on the other hand, wasn’t too anxious ...

In the end, before he could finish, Yuan Shuo said in exasperation,””Are you an idiot? How many people have we killed? three suns, sunshine, ten supers, and some martial masters ... How many good things have we killed? How much could he be mysterious about? If you don’t take advantage of the fact that the night patrolman powerhouses haven’t arrived to quickly collect the spoils of war, when the night patrolman powerhouses come, will I, your teacher, fall out with them for some spoils of war? The other party has also sent a sunshine sect member this time, and he’ll have to take the blame for us and protect us ... Do you think we can fall out with him?”

“We can ‘t!”

Li Hao shook his head.

.

“Then that’s it!”

Yuan Shuo laughed again,”now, only Huang Yun is here. He’s afraid of me. That guy doesn’t dare to fight with me. I’m going back. Everything is mine!” Otherwise ... If there really is a three suns, the night patrolmen will definitely get a share of the loot. We won’t leave them a single hair! Even if you and I can’t use it, can’t you use your Captain and that big-breasted woman?”

Was he referring to Liu Yan?

Li Hao was speechless. His teacher was still in the mood to care about this. He was really ... Disrespecting his elders!

I didn’t feel it in the past!

Could it be that he had been pretending in the past?

It was possible!

In the past, his teacher had no choice. He couldn’t defeat his opponents and had to retire in a low-key manner, pretending to be a professor of the ancient academy. Now that his strength had increased and he had killed an existence at the three yang realm, he naturally rose to power again!

“Hurry up, stop dawdling!”

As he said this, he threw the small sword to Li Hao.””The energy doesn’t feel as good as before. It seems that the energy here is limited ... What a pity, I don’t know if I can recover it. This energy is so useful! If I can’t recover, then it’ll be a huge loss!”

He felt a little regretful. When he was absorbing it just now, he clearly felt that the energy was not as strong as before. It was very weak.

Of course, if Li Hao absorbed it, it should be able to last for a while.

However, he was a warrior of the thousand, and if he continued sucking like this, he would soon be empty, so Yuan Shuo stopped.

“Teacher, this sword of mine ... I previously unsealed it ...”

“No!”

“No!” Yuan Shuo interrupted,”it’s just a temporary opening in the seal. That bit of blood from your heart is not even enough to fill the gaps between my teeth!” This sword of yours is more powerful than I imagined. Take it slow! It’s only unsealed a little, so it’s not very useful ... We’ll study this later!”

After saying that, he grabbed Li Hao and met his palm with Li Hao ‘s, foot with foot ... The next moment, he thought for a moment and suddenly took off Li Hao’s shoes.

Li Hao couldn’t move. Seeing that his teacher was about to take off his clothes ... He hurriedly said,””Teacher, it’s fine as long as you’re barefooted. Why are you taking off your clothes?”

“My clothes are still wet. It’s uncomfortable!”

“Don ‘t!”

“Teacher, let’s be more reserved!” Li Hao was anxious.

“You little bastard!”

Yuan Shuo cursed. Do you think I like to look at you?

Hehe!

Too lazy to say anything more, Yuan Shuo quickly took off Li Hao’s shoes and pressed his hands and feet against Li Hao ‘s, saying,””We’ll use the five birds breathing technique together later. Remember, I’ll circulate my strength and use my inner strength to attack you. Don’t resist! There’s no point in you resisting ... No one’s going to save you!”

Li Hao didn’t say anything.

The teacher’s words were getting more and more evil. He couldn’t listen to them anymore. He just had to obey.

The master and disciple no longer spoke.

The next moment, the two of them used the five birds breathing technique at the same time. Li Hao felt a powerful internal force instantly entering his body, shaking his blood and meridians. His solidified blood and meridians were suddenly impacted. Fortunately, their techniques were from the same source, so the impact wasn’t too strong.

Chapter 174: Dual cultivation (4)
The solidified energy was hit by the inner strength of the warrior’s Qian, and some of it dispersed.

Waves of energy seeped out.

Li Hao and Yuan Shuo were both absorbing the energy, and the Black Panther lying on the ground was also absorbing it. It was secretly using the breathing technique of five birds.

Yuan Shuo glanced at him and said,””This dog you’re raising is full of tricks. If you’re worried, kill him and eat the dog meat in a pot! If you think it’s fine, then forget it. ”

Li Hao also glanced at Black Panther, who was looking at them in fear. Li Hao laughed,””It’s fine. Even if this fellow has become a spirit, he shouldn’t harm me ... Or others!”

Yuan Shuo laughed and said no more. He quickly withdrew his strength.

He was hungry and thirsty now!

Li Hao’s small sword didn’t have enough energy, but this energy was better. He absorbed some and couldn’t help but say,””Good stuff! Different from the mysterious energy, this energy was more suitable for martial masters! There’s a bloody energy ... What the hell is that thing you killed?”

“A red shadow!”


“Red shadow?”

Yuan Shuo fell into deep thought and said after a long while,””I’ve never heard of it before. It might be something the red moon organization did in secret. This energy might not be of much help to supers, but it is more nourishing to martial masters like us! Interesting ... They should have quite a few. ”

The Crimson Moon!

At this moment, Yuan Shuo suddenly revealed a smile.

Li Hao glanced at his teacher and suddenly grinned.

The master and disciple looked at each other and suddenly laughed.

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

Yuan Shuo raised his eyebrows. Li Hao, with an understanding look, said in a low voice,””Teacher, I can see ... Ordinary people can’t see it. We have a chance ...”

“Cough cough!”

Yuan Shuo laughed.”We’re here to exterminate evil and defend the Dao. We’re not here for some red and white shadows. Don’t talk nonsense!” Also, remember, if we really want to exterminate the evil and defend the Dao, we can’t be like Liu Long. We have to have a good plan and be prepared, it’s best to kill two birds with one stone!”

He analyzed for Li Hao,”although the night patrollers are not as powerful as the three major organizations, there’s one advantage to being a night patroller. They’re official!” The three major organizations have always wanted to deal with the night patrolmen ... In fact, the night patrolmen are also fighting back. This time, I didn’t have time to take on some of the missions from the night patrolmen. Otherwise, I would have gotten some benefits by killing a three suns!”

Li Hao understood!

He understood!

He would get more benefits by sneaking into the night patrol and accepting the mission.

.

“Teacher, you don’t accept night patrollers, right?”

The night patrolman seemed to only accept superpowers.

“You don’t understand, we’ll talk about it later. Anyway, we’re on the night patrolman’s list this time. Didn’t you give that sword to Liu Long? Perhaps it was in Huang Yun’s hands now. This was proof of his loyalty! If they don’t accept you, would they have the face to take the sword?”

Yuan Shuo laughed and said,”there are many ways!” In short, when he was out and in the martial world, he had to first find a backer ... Or a scapegoat! Although I’m strong, I don’t have a strong enough backing. The night watchman might not be the strongest in the superpower realm but there are many at the three suns realm. Also, you have to know that we’re only in Silver Moon province! The majority of the night patrols are concentrated in the central region!”

“Not just you, even I, your teacher, might have to sneak in. Let’s do it first and wait until the night patrolmen can’t cover us anymore!”

Li Hao listened attentively. This was a wise saying from an old Martial Master who had been in the martial world for many years and had yet to be killed.

At this moment, the two of them were absorbing energy.

Li Hao felt that his body was getting stronger. His energy was being digested, his blood was getting stronger, and his bones and muscles were getting stronger.

Yuan Shuo pointed out again,”this time, your Constitution should be close to or directly over a hundred!” But you have to remember that Constitution is Constitution, speed is speed, strength is strength ... Also, experience, technique, and reaction ability are all the foundations of a Martial master’s survival! Don’t become one of those Little Rascals among the night patrollers. All of them only have energy but no matching qualities!”

“You must practice the five birds technique diligently! It’s enough for you to cultivate to the thousand warrior level! The five birds technique is very well-balanced. It might lack some explosive power, but you have the “nine forms of force.” With this, you don’t lack any techniques or energy. What you lack is proficiency in using it!”

“After you return to the Silver City, you must practice more. If you have nothing to do, go and find Liu Long to fight ... He will be too embarrassed to be ruthless to you.”

“Teacher ...”

“I’ll practice with you ...”Li Hao interrupted him.

“Nonsense!”

Yuan Shuo interrupted him,”do I have the time to train a rookie like you?” Besides, I know what you’re going to do even if you fart. What’s the point of me practicing with you? Free labor, can’t you pick your own? And you want me to be your sparring partner? Have you considered the fact that I’m an old man in my 70s?”

What a joke!

He was so busy that he didn’t have the time to be Li Hao’s sparring partner. Since Liu Long had nothing to do, he naturally came!

Li Hao was completely speechless!

Why did it feel like his teacher’s patience had decreased after this upgrade? he would have agreed to be his sparring partner in the past.

The master and disciple no longer spoke.

Li Hao used the breathing technique of five birds and observed his surroundings. Where was he now?

Because his teacher was by his side, he didn’t ask much.

But now ... Why did it look like a sewer?

Which sewer are we hiding in?

……

After more than an hour of dual cultivation, Li Hao felt that more than half of the energy in his body had been broken down. His blood was no longer solidified, and it began to flow with great strength.

Chapter 175: Chapter 43 dual cultivation (5)
That feeling ... It was as if he could kill Liu Long with a single punch.

Of course, Li Hao knew that this was an illusion.

Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, heaved a sigh of relief in satisfaction.””Comfortable! This energy was pretty good, and it was mixed with some spiritual energy. As expected, that thing was a tonic for martial masters! My injuries are almost healed. Now that I have the three yang, I can still do it!”

The premise was that he had to use the blood Blade technique and the stone blade.

What he was afraid of was that the energy of the stone saber would run out and the blood saber technique would be used up. Then, he would not be able to recover it.

The energy of the small sword was almost exhausted, and the energy that Li Hao had absorbed was also almost gone. The remaining energy was only enough for Li Hao to absorb and digest.

Therefore, if he wanted to kill another three yang ... The chance was slim!

Of course, the three suns might not dare to provoke him now.

As for Li Hao, he stood up at this moment and quickly used the five birds technique. He felt that his strength had increased a lot, but he was still not used to it.

As Yuan Shuo watched, he pointed out,””Remember, a Martial master’s power comes from their own cultivation. It’s produced in their bodies! “So, there’s nothing to not get used to. We’ll get used to it very quickly. We’re not like those useless supers. Our powers are almost all foreign and difficult to control! We don’t have the problem of controlling it. You’re only in the early stages, and this is the first time you’ve felt the power ...”

“In the later stage, you’ll be able to get used to it after two days of sleep!”

“Don’t listen to other people’s nonsense. What realm can’t keep up with your power...When your power is enough, it means that your realm is enough! Of course, to reach the warrior’s Qian level, one had to learn how to use divine intent, which was also the use of force. Otherwise, this level would be really difficult! If it breaks 100, it’ll be fine as long as you have enough strength!”

Li Hao listened carefully. His teacher’s words were all wise!

At this moment, Yuan Shuo also stood up and kicked Heibao who was playing dead.””Let’s go out and see if there’s any danger. Then, let’s go to the Silver City and see if there are any powerful supers there. If you don’t have it, quickly come back and report, or I’ll slaughter you and eat your meat!”

“……”

The Black Panther tucked its tail between its legs. It was a little afraid of the old man and ran out in a hurry.

It was more comfortable following Li Hao, but following this ... When Li Hao was sleeping, the old man would drool at it as if he wanted to eat meat. It was so scary!

After Heibao left, Yuan Shuo said thoughtfully,””This dog might not be simple! ‘It can even see red Shadows at the spiritual level, but I can’ t. This means that this dog is special!’ Following you might not be without reason, it might be related to your eight great families “bloodline! Could it be that this dog ancestor is related to the eight great families “ancestors?”

It was a possibility, but he could only analyze it. It didn’t matter whether it was true or not.

“Remember, kid, you can keep a dog, but you can’t let a dog become your master! Raising a spiritual monster dog might be helpful, but once a spiritual monster is above you ... Then you’re an idiot!”

Yuan Shuo used his life experience to call Li Hao time and time again.

Li Hao had also been listening. He admired this teacher a lot and thought about almost every word he said.

“Let’s go back!”

Yuan Shuo strode outside. When he walked out of the dark passage, Li Hao looked outside and realized that they were no longer in the Silver City!

“This is Wu city. Let’s stay here for a while. If we go back now, we can still have dinner tonight!”

Yuan Shuo led Li Hao on the streets of Wu city. It was very natural and not out of place.

“Remember, when we return, don’t say anything. Just give that sword to the night patrolmen ... Don’t give it too easily ... Just tell your teacher that I’m in charge of it. I don’t think they’ll dare to snatch it away so easily!”

Li Hao obediently nodded.

“If it’s possible, leave the Silver City as soon as possible!” Yuan Shuo added.

Li Hao nodded again. After some thought, he said,””I saw the eight trigrams above the Silver City. It should be connected to the eight bloodlines. Seven of the lines are connected to the distance, and only my line is still in the Silver City!”

“Yes, if it’s not unsealing, then it’s something else. It’s probably the work of the eight great ancestors! Once you leave the Silver City, they won’t easily deal with you. They might need to stay within the Silver City and wait for Lan Yu to appear before they can make a move. Only then can they activate your bloodline and deal with that line!”

Yuan Shuo was too smart. The moment he said that, he quickly came up with some speculations.

“So, you’d better leave Silver City. In Silver Moon province, white moon City is the safest! The three major organizations won’t dare to act rashly there. ”

“The three great organizations?”

Li Hao had been listening to him, but he was still at a loss.

“Red Moon, flying heavens, Yama! The three major organizations had been around for more than 20 years. It was possible that some heavenly priests had appeared in secret and established the three major organizations 20 years ago! Even earlier than the night patrolman. ”

Yuan Shuo whispered,”these organizations probably knew that the superpowers were going to recover. They recruited a group of heavenly priests in advance. At that time, the night watchers were not even established. Naturally, they didn’t have time to react!” By the time the night watchers were established, a portion of the heavenly priests had already joined the three major organizations! Also, don’t look down on the night patrollers. They have not been established for long, but they are still able to stop these supernatural organizations. They are still very powerful. After all, they are established by the government!”

Li Hao nodded again.

The master and disciple duo left Wu city and headed towards Silvermoon City.

Go back and collect your spoils!

Yuan Shuo was not in a hurry. Even if the night patrolman powerhouses were coming, it would not be so soon. The existence of the three suns was of great use. It would take time to mobilize them at the last minute.

Chapter 176: Spoils of war (1)
Silver City.

19th of July.

It was still raining. The rain continued to fall, but it was not as heavy as last night. The rain was light, adding a hint of coolness to the summer.

Everything that happened last night seemed to have been forgotten.

Of course, the people of Silver City couldn’t forget last night. They couldn’t forget the rising sun in the northern suburbs, and they couldn’t forget the falling sun and the darkness.

They did not know what had happened.

However, they knew that the blizzard Silver city’s officials still existed. Today, the inspection Division was still conducting their routine inspections, and that was enough.

At any time, especially in troubled times, the government was more worthy of their trust and reliance.

At this time, they had no one else to rely on other than the official power.

The Cathedral in the city had been destroyed.

Today, that place had been sealed off and turned into a forbidden zone.

It was not just there. Any area where supers died was a restricted area. There were people from the inspection Office sealing it off, not allowing anyone to enter or leave.

The warehouse in the northern suburbs was the most important!

A top-notch existence that surpassed sunlight was killed by Yuan Shuo here. He was cut into pieces and could not be more dead.

……

Near the warehouse.

The warehouse had long been torn apart by the battle last night, revealing a large amount of explosives underground. Not only that, there were even a few cannons hidden in the distance. This was also Liu Long’s arrangement.

It was a pity that he didn’t use it.

Of course, it was a good thing that he didn’t use it. If he had, the situation might not have been like this.

At this moment, there were many people near the warehouse.

They were all gathered at the place where Divine Master Duan Tian had died last night.

Huang Yun, Wang Ming, Hu Hao, and Li Meng ...

The night patrolmen’s powerhouses were all here.

Not only that, the chubby mu Sen had also come. Liu Long was also injured. He wore a windbreaker and was waiting for Something in the Rain.

At this moment, the rain seemed to have stopped.

In an instant, a figure appeared in midair.

It was a short-haired man with a tired look on his face. He seemed to have come from a long distance and did not even have time to rest.

Huang Yun immediately noticed the person who had arrived and took a step forward, his face filled with joy,””Hao bu has come in person!”

He didn’t expect her to come so quickly.

Even if they rushed over directly from Whitemoon city, it did not take long. It seemed that the incident in Silver City had made the headquarters of the Silver Moon province’s Nightwatchers restless.

The short-haired man descended from the sky.

He wasn’t too tall, about 1.7 meters, and looked to be in his forties. He looked a little tired, and when he saw Huang Yun, he nodded slightly. He then looked at mu Sen and smiled,””Secretary mu!”

In terms of rank, mu Sen’s rank was not low. He was the patrol envoy, the real boss of the Silver City’s law enforcement agency.

He was actually one level higher than Huang Yun.

Of course, Huang Yun was only a patrol in name, the same rank as Liu Long. However, the rank of a night patrol was one rank higher than those of the same rank in the inspection Office. Huang Yun could be regarded as the same rank as mu Sen.

Mu Sen nodded his head slightly.”Hao bu came quite quickly. Is white moon City alright?”

“No problem!”

The man called Hao bu revealed a slight smile.”Whitemoon city is impregnable, and no one dares to rashly enter the city to cause trouble ...”

He was just being polite.

In the end, mu Sen replied in a rather strange tone,””Oh, really? Since white moon City was impregnable, why did a sunlit person come last night? A big city is a city, but a small city isn ‘t?”

“……”

Department head Hao didn’t react for a moment.

I’m just saying that, but it’s still quite difficult. Why does it sound like ... The night patrolman is an unpardonable criminal?

“Secretary mu has misunderstood ...”

Mu Sen’s face was nonchalant,”I’m used to it!” It was a small city with a population of a million, so it was nothing if all of them died! What kind of place was white moon City? With a population of 30 million in a super large city, once something happened, many people would die! You see, our Silver City doesn’t even have a single night patrol Division ... This is the bloody reality!”

On the side, Liu Long lowered his head. His ears twitched slightly when he heard this and he said softly,”Our Silver City is too small, and we don’t have any supers. Even if we do, we can’t set up a branch in the White moon City!”

Mu Sen laughed,” The previous Secretary was not bad. I heard that he became a super with over 100 abilities and became a top contender at the sunlit level. What a pity...He won’t be able to return! It’s so fragrant outside, and the world is so big. He also wants to see it ... But there’s no other way. ”

Department head Hao was a little speechless.

Huang Yun coughed lightly.”Director mu, the situation is more critical than you think. There are not many night patrols, and the central region is in constant trouble. We have even sent some elites over ... There is no way we can cover all 32 cities in Silvermoon province.”

“This time, I gave up on the defense of Hudong city and came here secretly ... Fortunately, everything is fine there. Otherwise, I would be a sinner.”

Let’s play the relationship card. Am I not here?

The Silver City had a lot of complaints about the White moon City, which was something that could not be helped.

What mu Sen had said was the truth. Silver City did not even have a branch.

The night watchman in Silvermoon province did not only have a branch in white moon City. In fact, there were also branches in a few other large cities. There were some star light Masters and moon Dark Masters stationed there, and some large cities even had a sun glory master.

Mu Sen sneered.

“The demon-hunting teams in Silver City are stronger than the Nightwatchers in many cities!” Minister Hao also smiled. One Liu Long is equivalent to several dark moons, and Secretary mu is extremely powerful ... Although the Silver City is small, its defense is not weak. We just didn’t expect so many powerful people to come!”

Chapter 177: Chapter 44 spoils of war (2)
“One three suns, one sunlit, ten dark moons, one above 100, and nine tenth beheading realm...To be more realistic, other than Whitemoon city and yaoguang city, none of the other 32 cities in the entire Silvermoon province can stop them!”

These words could be considered as flattering mu Sen and the rest.

However, this was not what mu Sen wanted. He smiled and said,””Does that mean that Hao bu also recognizes the strength of our Silver City?”

Hao bu was a little embarrassed.

Mu Sen was unforgiving,”in that case, I suggest that the Demon Hunter squad be upgraded to a branch of the night patrollers in Silver City!” Liu Long will be the branch’s City Patrol!”

“This ...”

Before department head Hao could say anything, mu Sen said,”This time, Liu Long has made a great contribution and must be rewarded! Even though he was not a superpower, did the night patrolmen only look at whether he was a superpower and not his actual combat power and achievements? If that’s the case, the night patrolmen are too short-sighted!”

Mu Sen chuckled and continued,”If it’s upgraded, under normal circumstances, it needs at least 10 night watchers! No matter if it was a Starlight master or a moon underworld master, they could all do it! In addition, 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy every month seems to be the basic amount ... The Silver City is in a precarious situation now, and I don’t think we can distribute it according to the usual distribution. At least 1000 cubic meters should be enough!”

Department head Hao opened his mouth!

Huang Yun was also dumbfounded.

As for Wang Ming and the others, they were already dumbfounded.

What was going on?

Mu Sen smiled and said,”apart from that, all the equipment will be distributed according to the rules of the other cities!” In addition, this time we killed a three suns, a sun glory ... These, the night patrolmen will be resupplied according to the merits!”

“Oh, last night the Silver City suffered heavy losses. It’s best if the night patrolmen can provide some supplies ... Especially ice crystals. We need a large number of them. It’s best if we can surround the Silver City!”

“Also, we need some extraordinary weapons!”

“……”

Silence!

Complete silence.

Department head Hao looked at him for a while before saying,””I’m the Deputy. I’ll pass on this message when I get back. As for whether it’ll work or not, I don’t have the right to decide!”

Drag it out first!

Mu Sen, this fatty, is he crazy? you’re telling me this the moment you see me. Are you afraid that I won’t die?

Mu Sen’s face was indifferent,”then I’ll take it that Hao bu has agreed!” The Nightwatchers are in Silvermoon province, with one head and five deputies. Since Hao bu has agreed, I don’t think the others will be a problem. ”

Go to hell!

Department head Hao almost wanted to curse!

When did I agree?

The Silver City’s decision was to disband and migrate, but once the night patrol Division was set up, it meant that they were defending the city. He really didn’t dare to easily agree to this.

This time, he suddenly felt that he had come at the wrong time.

He felt like he was sitting on pins and needles!

This damn fatty, this damn Fatty’s ability to see through every opportunity was really ... Nothing to say!

Mu Sen then said,”Hao bu, I’m not trying to make things difficult for you, but the truth is that it has to be done!” Yuan Shuo had entered the warrior dimension and reached the peak of the warrior dimension. He had killed three suns and could be regarded as a three suns super ... But the hometown of a three suns expert did not even have a night Watcher? Are you trying to turn my heart cold? And silver City doesn’t seem to be that simple. Those eight great families ... Just this point alone is enough for the night patrol to pay attention to them!”

“In my opinion, not only must it be established, but there must also be three suns to oversee it! It’s not too much for a few dozen from riyao to come ...”

The more he spoke, the more outrageous it was!

However, he had to take the Fatty’s words into consideration.

After pondering for a moment, Minister Hao nodded slightly.””I’ll pass on the message, but I still can’t make a decision!”

“En!”

Mu Sen did not make things difficult for this person. After all, he was the Deputy. It was unrealistic to expect him to make a decision directly, but it was enough as long as his meaning was in place.

He turned to look at Liu Long and said,”Captain Liu ... No, Liu Zhicheng, thank Minister Kuang properly!” I’m here to tell some good news to your colleagues in white moon City. Hao bu has come all the way here to give you a promotion and let everyone in white moon City know that night patrols reward and punish clearly!”

Minister Hao couldn’t help but say,”director mu, that’s enough. I will put in a good word for you. But I’ve already said that I’m only a Deputy!”

With that, he no longer paid attention to the fatty.

He could be angered to death!

He walked into the distance. There were many blood clots there that had not been cleared up.

Huang Yun followed behind and quickly said,”this is the remains of the three yang. It contains the power of the three yang. I’m afraid that if I clean it up rashly, the power of the three yang will leak out!” You’re also a three yang ... You should be able to collect the mysterious energy!”

There were strong and weak Mystic abilities of supers.

It wasn’t impossible for him to collect the three suns, but it would be a great loss if it leaked or even overflowed.

It’s better to leave it here!

He didn’t know how Yuan Shuo had killed these corpses, but he could still feel that the energy in the pieces had been sealed up.

At this moment, department head Hao squatted down and picked up a piece of the corpse.

In the next moment, a blood-colored saber Qi spread out!

The sound of thunder came from his palm. With a boom, he left a faint bloody mark on Minister kui’s palm.

Department head Hao’s expression was a little grave.

“What a dense and sharp saber Qi!”

The remaining saber Qi had actually injured him!

Yuan Shuo’s attack that killed his opponent was stronger than he had imagined.

Was this a thousand-man battle?

It wasn’t that he had never seen a warrior of the thousand-warrior level, but of course, not in the Silver Moon province.

He had fought with Martial Master douqian before, and he was very strong. However, it was impossible for him to kill three suns above his realm.

Chapter 178: Spoils of war (3)
When superhumans reached the three suns, they did not lack combat experience and did not lack life and death training.

Other than the fact that they might not have trained as long as the other party, supers were not inferior to those old martial masters.

However, Yuan Shuo had still managed to kill him!

At this moment, mu Sen and the others were also shocked.

It was unbelievable that the residual saber energy could still hurt department head Hao!

“His weapon is not simple!”

“It’s not just his weapon, but his secret technique is also extraordinary!” Divine intent mixed with blood and Qi, body and spirit as one, merging into one ... Yuan Shuo is indeed the top martial Master who swept the world back then!”

The old man was stronger than other martial masters because he knew more secret skills!

Department head Hao’s eyes were a little serious. He was considering if he could gain the upper hand if he fought with Yuan Shuo.

He was also at the three-yang level, and there was not much difference between his strength and broken Sky ‘s.

Yuan Shuo could kill duantian, and if the opportunity was right, it was not impossible for him to kill him.

Of course, in a battle between experts, it was possible to see who would kill who based on the favorable circumstances.

“Broken Sky is dead. I’m afraid there’s a commotion at the Crimson Moon!”

Department head Hao added.

“Will they attack again?” Huang Yun was worried.

“Heh, don’t worry!”

“The death of one of the three suns is enough to make them feel heartache for a long time. Moreover, the red moon’s main force is actually not in Silver Moon province, but in the central region!” The other party can’t mobilize too much power to come to Silver Moon. If they really dare to come, aren’t they afraid of the second and third Suns dying?”

He then added,’of course, we still have to be cautious! The Nightwalker’s defense is too big and there are too many targets. The other party is an idle organization, so it’s easier to avoid people’s eyes and ears. We still have to be careful!”

Mu Sen was not interested in knowing all this. He knew all this.

“How much of the mysterious energy can I extract?” he asked directly.

This was the key!

Who cares about anything else!

Department head Hao looked at the scattered bodies around and pondered for a moment.””A lot of it has seeped out, but if I extract all of it, it should be around 1000 cubic meters!”

1000 cubic meters, 10 meters long, wide, and tall, was a cube.

One person obviously couldn’t fit it!

However, the volume of the mysterious energy was not calculated in this way. It was calculated when it spread out, filled the ice crystals, and then stopped spreading.

As for mu Sen, he frowned,”so little?” Killing Yue Ming would usually give him 20-40 cubic meters of cash! Let’s make an average of 30 cubic meters. One three suns is comparable to 30 dark moons?”

That’s too little!

“No.” Department head Hao shook his head.”You can’t calculate it this way. Besides, this one has consumed a lot of energy and has been placed there for a night. It’s already not bad if we can withdraw 1000 cubic meters! And that’s the reason why it hasn’t dissipated too much. ”

Huang Yun also nodded and quickly added,””That sun glory is Ying Hongyue’s son, a lightning element super! He’s used up a lot of energy, so it’s already a lot for him to withdraw one or two hundred cubic meters. ”

As for the 10 moon nether cultivators, they would only be worth about two to three hundred cubic meters in total.

On the side, Liu Long did some calculations. In that case, he would be able to withdraw a total of 1500 cubic meters ... Which was an astronomical figure!

His demon-hunting team had killed five supers and obtained a total of 120 cubic meters of mysterious energy.

He had spent more than three years.

This time, the mysterious energy harvest was more than ten times. If it was a demon hunting team, it would take more than 30 years to harvest so much.

However, when he thought of the fact that three suns had come this time ... There was nothing more to say.

He still felt that such a small harvest was too little!

This was because the risk was not ten times that of normal times, but hundreds or even thousands of times!

Without Yuan Shuo, everyone was finished!

“Also, there’s a super item. The Thunder-type super is carrying a super weapon!” Huang Yun continued.

As for the three suns in front of him, he didn’t bring anything.

It was a bit of a pity!

“Mm, it’s alright!”

“Where’s yuan Shuo?”Minister Chu nodded.

“He disappeared with his student last night ... It’s the Li family descendant!”

“I know,”

Minister Chu nodded. At this moment, his eyes flickered.

A moment later, a dog was the first to enter his sight.

After a while, Yuan Shuo and Li Hao slowly walked over.

Yuan Shuo saw the man from a distance. He whispered to Li Hao,””Do you see that short guy in front?”

“Yes.”

“That guy’s name is Hao lianchuan, and the night patrolman has a provincial headquarters in Silvermoon province! The night patrolman, Silvermoon province, had one head and five deputies, and six Minister-level powerhouses! This guy was in the top three! Other than the official one, he is one of the top existences. It is said that in Silver Moon province, there are only two three Sun night watchmen. One of them is the official one, and the other could be him ... Before today, I didn’t dare to confirm, but now I can confirm without a doubt that this guy is indeed at the three sun level!”

Li Hao nodded. He could tell.

He could see the ball of light from far away!

“Teacher, there are only two three suns in the Silver Moon province as night patrollers?”

“More or less.”

Yuan Shuo whispered,”don’t think that there are many three suns ... If there were really many, Duan Tian wouldn’t have been the only one who came last night!” I’ve told you before that I’ll only be facing three to five people in the thousand warrior stage. On the surface, there are only three to five three sun realm experts in Silver Moon province!”

“Oh?” Li Hao understood and asked in a low voice,”so teacher is in the top five now?”

Even though his teacher had not reached a higher level, he had killed one of the three suns ... Would the other three suns dare to look down on him?

“Don’t say that ... Top five?”Yuan Shuo smiled reservedly.

Then, she paused and laughed softly,””It’s the guy who’s ranked first. Does he dare to challenge me? I’ve killed three suns, what about them? I think I might be the first person to kill a three sun realm in Silver Moon province! Do you understand?”

Chapter 179: Chapter 44 spoils of war (4)
Cultivation was cultivation, combat power was combat power. The other three suns were strong, but that didn’t mean he could kill them. As for Yuan Shuo, no matter how he killed him, he had killed him before!

Just because of this, the other three suns did not dare to challenge him.

As they spoke, the distance between them grew closer and closer. Yuan Shuo continued,””This time, I paid a huge price to kill this three suns. I don’t know if the spoils of war are enough for me to pay the price!”

Spoils of war!

In the distance, Hao lianchuan’s eyes were a little strange.

Mu Sen and the others had also heard it, but they did not say a word.

As for Huang Yun, he looked at Hao lianchuan helplessly and said in a low voice,””When he left last night, he said that the spoils of war were all his ...”

This ... What should we do?

Hao lianchuan did not say anything.

Yuan Shuo, an old acquaintance!

“Professor Yuan!”

From a distance, he took the initiative to greet her with a smile,””Congratulations, professor Yuan, for becoming a warrior of the universe, killing the three suns, and becoming the number one in the Silver Moon martial arts world! He’s a real God of the land!”

“You’re too polite!”

Yuan Shuo chuckled and cupped his hands,”luck, luck!” This guy’s brain isn’t very good. I slashed at him, but he didn’t even fight back ... After all, he’s a superpower. Perhaps he lacks combat experience, so I had no choice. I killed him after a few more slashes! If I had known that the three suns were so easy to kill, I would have given it a try a few years ago before I advanced. Maybe I could just kill one and advance to a super!”

“……”

Awkward!

Huang Yun didn’t know if Hao lianchuan was embarrassed or not, but he was.

However, it seemed impossible to argue with Martial Master douqian, who had killed a three-Sun Warrior.

Hao lianchuan didn’t mind. He smiled and said,””That’s true. Professor Yuan has been practicing martial arts for decades. He dominated a Region 20 years ago. We’re all juniors. In terms of experience, we’re naturally not as good as professor Yuan.”

You are right, but you are very old!

Why are you saying this!

Before he advanced, he wasn’t so arrogant. Now that he had advanced ... He even dared to talk back to the three suns.

Yuan Shuo was not in the mood to bicker with him. He laughed and turned to Li Hao.”Go, ask uncle Huang to collect the mysterious energy for you. Collect everything that should be collected. We’ve lost a lot this time, so we have to get something to make up for it!”

“Where’s my disciple’s sword?”he asked Liu Long.

Liu Long didn’t say anything and only took out a small sword. Beside him, Hao lianchuan’s eyes flickered.

He didn’t know that it was in Liu Long’s hands.

Otherwise, he should have taken a look.

Unfortunately, Yuan Shuo was here, so he couldn’t say anything.

Li Hao took a step forward, took the small sword, and said in a low voice,””Boss, where are the others?”

Liu Long was the only one present. Liu Yan and the others were not present.

“Heal! Wu Chao’s injuries aren’t light, and the others are also injured. Yunyao is currently treating them. ”

Li Hao nodded.

Then, he looked at the old man, who was uncle Huang that Yuan Shuo had mentioned. His meaning was very clear ...”Please help me collect the mysterious energy. This thing is not something that ordinary people can collect.”

Huang Yun was a little embarrassed as he looked at Hao lianchuan.

Hao lianchuan didn’t say anything. The three suns were precious when they were alive, but when they were dead ... They were nothing!

No one expected to kill supers to obtain mysterious powers, except for people like Liu Long.

Killing a three Sun Warrior costs 1000 cubic meters ... But you have to know that a 100-man Martial Master might only need that much to become a super ... It might be less, but killing a three Sun Warrior to get the mysterious energy is definitely not worth it!

Li Hao felt that mysterious energy was obtained from killing people, but that was because he had not seen the world.

If that was the case, the supernatural realm would have been in complete chaos!

It was hard to say whether Hao lianchuan valued the mysterious energy or not. Hao lianchuan didn’t care about it. Instead, he looked at Li Hao, at the sword in his hand, and then at Li Hao himself.

The Li family descendant!

Silver city’s eight great families, the last successor ... What kind of secret were the eight great families hiding?

Hong Yue had actually paid such a great price to kill the people of the eight great families!

“Professor Yuan, this is Li Hao? As expected of a professor’s student!”

Hao lianchuan laughed and said,”I heard that he joined the inspection Office. We’re colleagues!” “He’s avenging his friend and values friendship. This time, he’s even made a huge contribution by capturing all the members of the red moon in one fell swoop ... This time, the inspector Bureau will definitely reward him based on his contribution. I think a patrol envoy is no problem!”

Yuan Shuo laughed,”you got a raise?” From two to three thousand, it has increased to ten to twenty thousand?”

“……”

Hao lianchuan was speechless.

“Professor Yuan, Hongyue’s attack was unexpected. Of course, it also had something to do with Li Hao. To be honest, we don’t know much about the blizzard Silver City, especially some of the ancient matters. Even professor Yuan didn’t expect it, let alone us!”

Hao lianchuan explained,””I heard that there’s a folk song in Silver City that says ‘the Li family’s sword’. I wonder if I can have the honor to appreciate it?” he asked.

On the other side, Li Hao glanced at Yuan Shuo, then at Hao lianchuan. In the end, he still went forward and handed the small sword to him.

Hao lianchuan smiled back and sensed for a while. He was a little moved. It was sealed!

He checked carefully and found that the seal was still very powerful!

He couldn’t see anything specific, but just this powerful seal was enough to prove that this sword wasn’t simple!

“Do you want it, night patrolman?” Yuan Shuo asked directly.

“Not bad!”

Hao lianchuan did not beat around the bush and said,””Professor Yuan is here and he’s not beating around the bush! First, the red moon might have come for this sword. It’s too dangerous for Li Hao to hold it. Professor, you should understand this!”
Chapter 180: Chapter 44 spoils of war (5)
“Second, we are indeed very curious about the eight great families. We also hope to trace the origin of the Crimson Moon and study it!”

“Thirdly, Li Hao hasn’t been unsealed yet, and it’s probably difficult to find a way to do so ... Maybe we can give it a try. You have to know that the night patrollers are a large organization with countless talents. They’ll definitely have more ways to unseal than Li Hao!”

He glanced at Li Hao and then at Yuan Shuo.””This sword is now a source of trouble!”

Yuan Shuo laughed,”I know, that’s why my disciple gave it to me!” That would not be an incident! Ask Ying Hongyue to come and find me. He was a dog twenty years ago, and he will still be a dog twenty years later!”

“Professor, it’s been 20 years ... Ying Hongyue has been a super for 20 years, and even the three suns have appeared under her. What do you think her current strength is?”

Hao lianchuan said seriously,”two years ago, Ying Hongyue made a move and also killed a three yang!” And it was hard to say if he had used his full strength! He’s currently in the central region, fighting with the Yama, the fairy, and the Nightwalker headquarters. He can’t come here for the time being, but that doesn’t mean he can ‘t!”

“Professor, you’re a smart man, so I’ll be direct. It’s safer to leave it to the night patrolmen than to let the professor carry it.”

Yuan Shuo laughed,”that’s true!” How about this, there aren’t many conditions. First, announce that you’ve taken the Li family’s sword! Second, protect me and Li Hao! Third, mysterious and omnipotent. Fourth, Li Hao wanted to join the night patrol. Fifth, I need all the ancient books you’ve collected over the years. Sixth, you protect Li Hao personally. Seventh, for the next exploration of the ancient ruins, Li Hao would have priority in choosing three relics from the ancient civilization. The eighth ...”

At that moment, Hao lianchuan felt worse than if he had eaten sh * t.

The Li family’s sword was still sealed. It was hard to say what level of treasure it was, or even if it could be unsealed. Red Moon might have a way, but the night watchman did not know much for the time being.

Moreover, taking the sword away was indeed protecting Li Hao, but Yuan Shuo had demanded an exorbitant price.

And he was still talking!

He felt that he could not even agree to the first few terms, not to mention that Yuan Shuo was getting more and more excited as he spoke. He was just short of tying the night patrol to his crotch!

“Number 11, return all the red fruits I found last time.”

“The twelfth ...”

“Professor,” Hao lianchuan interrupted,”you can keep the sword!”

I don’t want it anymore.

Do as you wish!

Yuan Shuo raised his eyebrows and glanced at him. He laughed,””Don’t give me that! The night patrolmen have a lot of good things, and I have a pile of treasures that I have personally explored. To put it bluntly, I have more treasures than I have, so is it too much? If I hadn’t helped you all these years, do you think you would have so many treasures?”

“Professor, the night patrollers have paid the price over the years. You know how many people have died. Besides, we need to resist those criminals ... Some things have been used up long ago.”

“Then forget it.”

Yuan Shuo directly took the small sword away.”Take it or leave it! It won’t be a big problem if I bring it along. Since Ying Hongyue dared to come, then he would give it a try! I wasn’t afraid of him back then, and I’m even less afraid of him now! As for the eight great families of the silver Blizzard city, they might be hiding countless treasures and secrets ... We’ll dig them out ourselves. ”

Hao lianchuan was completely speechless.

He then looked at Li Hao and smiled.””Li Hao, what do you think?”

Li Hao was a little embarrassed. He glanced at his teacher and said in a low voice,””Teacher ... Why don’t we give it to the night patrol?”

“What?”

“Have you forgotten who protected you?” Yuan Shuo was furious.

Li Hao said drily,”no, teacher ... I’m worried that you’re in danger!” At least it’s safer to give it to the night patrolman ... Your conditions are too much to me. It’s just a sword, and I usually just think about it. Last time, Wang Ming said he wanted to buy it for a hundred thousand, and I almost agreed. ”

On the side, Wang Ming was a little embarrassed and wanted to dig a hole. Why was he saying this now?

Li Hao said seriously,’night patrollers protect their homes and country, so they need to train countless elites to resist strong enemies! Teacher, if we ask for too much, what will they do? We’re on the side of justice, not robbers!”

Hao lianchuan secretly praised her in his heart.

No wonder the intelligence said that Li Hao was smart, sensible, loyal, and honest. He was also praised by the inspection Office.

With just these words, this person was worth nurturing!

“You little bastard, what do you know?”

Yuan Shuo scolded,”you idiot, did I do this for myself?” It’s all for you ...”

“Teacher!”

Li Hao straightened his neck and didn’t dare to look at him.””Please let me be willful this once. I ... I don’t want to see the night patrolmen pay too high a price, causing someone to pay the price of death! “I think we can reduce your conditions by a few, especially with Minister Hao’s personal protection. He’s an omnipotent expert, and he needs to protect the entire Silver Moon province, not just me! Ten thousand cubics...Teacher, do you know how much you have to pay for ten thousand? I think ... At most one-third would be enough!”

“I don’t know if the rest are precious,” Li Hao said.”I think I can only take one-third at most!”

“……”
