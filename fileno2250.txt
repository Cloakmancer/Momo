You know it better than anyone else!He was just playing dead!If you weren't called, you wouldn't be willing to take the initiative to do it. You were afraid of being in the limelight and causing everyone to be afraid.I was like this in the past.Unless Li Hao asked, she rarely took the initiative to do anything. But now ... Wasn't it different?I'm the Marquis's wife!Lin Hongyu smiled.……Very quickly.Hurricane city.When Qian Wuliang appeared outside the city and loudly stated his request, a group of people in the city were furious.However, there were also people who were somewhat thoughtful.Change lanes!A new path!If he did ... It would be dangerous, and Li Hao could easily control him.Meanwhile, Zheng Yu fell into deep thought.Switching paths, stabilizing the world, stabilizing the great Dao ... This was indeed a fact. He also knew that Li Hao had made such a big move just for this.It shouldn't be.It was possible that he really had the intention of resurrecting Yuan Shuo and the others.Of course, changing paths and allowing a group of experts to use a new path was also to strengthen his control. The new Dao universe was in Li Hao's hands, so he could control these people more directly by changing paths.Zheng Yu didn't get angry. He looked at Qian Wuliang who was standing outside the city and said in a calm voice,""Li Hao, you don't have to worry about my people! As for the cultivation resources you want, do you think we'll still have them after a hundred thousand years?"Qian Wuliang smiled."Master, you are so powerful! Just a little bit of it will be enough for us to switch paths. Also, the people who are going to switch paths this time are all descendants of venerable sovereigns. They are not ordinary people!""If these people succeed, they might thank you for saving their lives. When they return to new martial in the future ... They might even plead for you! Senior human King might not care about one or two of them. If they've already pleaded for you, it means that many venerable sovereigns have pleaded for you ... You might be able to avoid death ...""You're very bold!"Zheng Yu laughed.Spare my life?Qian Wuliang smiled brightly."Of course. We won. If we lose, it's useless." He said. Why don't we make a good relationship with Daren? if there's a little hope, what if we win? The Silvermoon people don't have much of a background, but these descendants of venerable sovereigns all have some background. ""No, you don't need to waste your breath!"Zheng Yu couldn't be bothered to say anything more.Qian Wuliang, on the other hand, kept trying to persuade him. He also knew that if he didn't come and really gave it to him ... Zheng Yu would be a fool. Last time, it was because Li Hao was willing to exchange it with the power of a great Dao, but this time, it was different. He was getting something for nothing, and it was an enemy 's. Would Li Hao give it to him?He had come to appease them and buy time.Don't mess around!Qian Wuliang was well aware of the purpose of his visit, so he didn't give up. Instead, he talked so much that his mouth was dry and his words made the people in the city extremely impatient. In the end, the soundproofing formation in the city was activated and they stopped listening to him.A bastard chanting Scriptures!In fact, Qian Wuliang knew this, but he didn't hesitate to continue. He was going to talk for a day and a night ... And it should be enough.…… In the Dao universe.Soon, Li Hao received the news that he was almost ready.The students could change lanes at any time.Li Hao glanced at the river that was still unstable and said,""Then I'll guide their great DAOs to this side of the river and output some of the power of the great DAOs to help them open a new path! Uncle-master, since the power of the great Dao isn't too strong at night, you and Heibao should help me stabilize it!""Don't worry!"Hong Yitang nodded.Seeing this, Li Hao was relieved and left.The moment he left ... BOOM!Hong Yitang was flustered, and Heibao also howled. It was not until now that they realized that Li Hao had suppressed most of the river, while they had only suppressed a small part.Now that Li Hao had left ... They were a little upset.Hong Yitang was in extreme pain. He grabbed Black Panther's head tightly, causing Black Panther to wail in pain. Hong Yitang said gloomily,""Stop shouting! I'm annoyed!""Aowu!"The Black Panther howled in pain."You think I can stop just because you say so?"It hurts!It wasn't just the pain of the power of great DAOs exploding, but also the pain from Hong Yitang's grasp. It was too painful. Obviously, this person was in so much pain that he wished he was dead. For the sake of his face, he didn't scream.However, it was a pity!……Li Hao actually knew, but he pretended not to know.Old Hong had just lectured him, so he couldn't say much. Now ... He would suffer for a while. As the saying goes,"exhaust your muscles and bones, starve your skin ..." It was all because the heavens wanted you to become stronger. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ At the same time, it was actually a good thing that he had been baptized by the power of ten thousand DAOs and survived.He tore open the void and appeared out of thin air.At this moment, Lin Hongyu was standing opposite him.This was the first time he had met Lin Hongyu since the announcement. Lin Hongyu was stunned for a moment. She glanced at Li Hao, then quickly looked away and lowered her head.As if ... She was shy?Li Hao didn't look at him for long. Maintaining his expressionless face, he said calmly,""You've worked hard!""I should!""Well done.""Lord Marquis's plans are well thought out!"“……”Both sides were silent.After a moment of silence, Li Hao said,""Tell heaven battling city to move over. All the students are to gather in the city. I want to change the road for them in the city!""Alright!"Lin Hongyu passed down the order.Then, both parties fell silent again.After a while, they arrived at heaven battling city. Li Hao looked at the distant heaven battling city, then at Lin Hongyu, and said calmly,""The great DAOs in your body are too complicated. I'll help you sort them out later! It's normal for me to feel uncomfortable and lose control these few days ..."

"Yes."Seeing this, Li Hao turned around and left.Lin Hongyu heaved a sigh of relief. He was finally gone. She didn't feel so bad when she faced Li Hao in the past, but now she felt terrible.Both sides didn't know how to talk.Just as he was thinking, Li Hao suddenly turned around."Well ... Don't give any random orders. Just say that I did it. There's no need to cover up for me. I'm never afraid of being cursed!"Lin Hongyu did not say anything. The moment Li Hao stopped, he also disappeared and flew toward heaven battling city.After he left, Lin Hongyu's face revealed a faint smile.……In heaven battling city.Li Hao didn't say anything. He quickly ran through the great Dao universe. The great Dao of the origin quickly connected to the great Dao universe, and Li Hao disappeared again.After returning to the universe of the great Dao, he pretended not to see Hong Yitang, who had just beaten Black Panther ... He quickly connected the great DAOs into the Galaxy, and the power of different great DAOs was quickly instilled.As he instilled, he said,"this is actually a good way to improve everyone. If this River is successfully forged, it will become a great Dao River!" There's a lot of power of great DAOs ... In the future, when everyone cultivates, the power of great DAOs that overflow will sink to the bottom of the river!""But if it's like today, connecting people's great Dao to this side ... Wouldn't it directly improve the other party?"It was as if there was an opening at the bottom of the river, gathering everyone's scattered great Dao power for their own use.This also gave Li Hao more experience.Hong Yitang suppressed the pain of the explosion and maintained his elegant manner. He said slowly,""It's possible ... But this is like reaping without sowing. Besides, cultivation, cultivation of the heart. If the heart is not strong enough, even if you have enough strength, it won't do! In fact, it's not bad for new martial arts to set up a Thunder tribulation for venerable sovereigns ... How can a cultivator become the strongest if he doesn't cultivate his heart?""That's the matter of the omnipotent experts. Ordinary people don't care!"Li Hao retorted,"cultivating the heart? that Zheng Yu might not have cultivated the heart. It's not bad for him to become a pseudo-Emperor!" Moreover, how many people could reach this stage? "In the future, I feel that the great Dao should start from the bottom of the Galaxy. Only when one can control their own planet can one be considered to have truly succeeded in cultivating the Dao ... If one can control an area, one will be the master of a Dao! Currently, there are only 360 Dao Masters ...""If he can truly control a region ... I think he might not be weaker than a half-step sovereign ... If the Galaxy continues to grow stronger and swallows the void universe, perhaps ... The master of a Dao can rival a venerable sovereign ... In other words, this great Dao universe might be able to accommodate 360 Dao Masters!"Hong Yitang was speechless. You're really ... So ambitious that it's unparalleled.360 Dao Masters and 360 venerable sovereigns?Do you know how many venerable sovereigns there are in the powerful new martial arts?There should be no more than 50. This was the accumulation of countless years of neo martial arts ... Well, in fact, neo martial arts was not long, but there was no doubt that neo martial arts was powerful. Now, you have just mastered the great Dao and you are only a Saint. How dare you say that you can produce 360 venerable sovereigns?What a big tone!He didn't want to hurt Li Hao's feelings. It was good to have ambition. Besides ... If he could really control an entire region, it would be possible for him to rival a pseudo-Emperor with countless stars in the region!If there really was an illusory cosmos, he might have a chance to rival a venerable sovereign if he United it again.As they talked and laughed, Li Hao began to channel the power of the river.……In heaven battling city. All of a sudden, the hundreds of students began to scream in pain. The next moment, their screams were filled with excitement."Heavens!""Why is there so much great Dao power?""Didn't you say that it's very difficult to cultivate in another path? Previously, Jiang Yingli and the rest had only cultivated to the mountain sea level ...""Oh my God, I've opened 180 apertures!"“……”At this moment, Jiang Ying, li and the others were also stunned. That was so fast!Yes, very soon!In the blink of an eye, all of them had opened their apertures, and in a short while, some of them had opened their meridians, which was equivalent to entering the mountains and seas. Was this ... Differential treatment?When they had cultivated to the mountain sea level, the power of the great Dao had stopped abruptly!But this time ... The endless power of the great DAOs surged into their bodies.This scene made some of the older people very jealous and resentful!This is too much!Even director Wang started to nag. I was the first to change, and even though I'm at the 7th level of the sun Moon level...It's been so hard for me to get to this point!These Little Rascals were too awesome. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ He didn't work for a long time, and just recently, he went to kill some weak God Kingdom cultivators, and then ... He changed lanes!Not only did he change his path, he even F * cking entered the mountain sea!Where could he go to reason?The crowd was envious and jealous, but very quickly ... Someone screamed,""Enough, enough, let me digest it ... Too much ..."That's enough!Stop typing!Why is it not over yet?I haven't had a physical body for many years, and now that I have one, I can instantly enter the mountains and seas. Now, I'm even madly opening my meridians. Are you asking me to enter the sun Moon realm?The sun and moon could match the peak.Even though they were all peak undyings before, but...They had to get used to it. Their bodies had just gotten used to it, and suddenly a large amount of Dao energy forced its way in. It was like someone had done something to them, they would collapse!At this moment, Jiang Yingli and the others also noticed that something was wrong. The power of the great Dao surged out madly.Moreover, it was the kind that didn't leak much.He directly typed it into them!Li Hao's voice was heard again.""Bear with it, bear with the pain for a moment, then you can catch up with everyone. Now, there are many people at the seventh level of the sun Moon realm, and you have missed too many opportunities. I can't bear to see you, the descendants of venerable sovereigns, dragging people down and disgracing our ancestors! Only by suffering can one rise above others, good luck!"

Chapter 2252 The Galaxy Is Formed, And He Re-Enters The Dao Integration Stage (1)
"Ah!"The crowd roared. They couldn't embarrass their ancestor!That's true!There are so many at the 7th stage of the sun Moon realm. If we were in the mountains and seas ... That would be too embarrassing.Good luck!Although they felt that Li Hao was too violent, they could only endure the pain and wail continuously. They began to force open their meridians, and their bodies exploded continuously!This was an opportunity!Some people's scalps turned numb. How cruel!Jiang Yingli was speechless. 'Thank God I recovered earlier. Although my improvement is slower, it's ... Comfortable.'Cultivation was a very comfortable thing.If it was so painful, what was the point of cultivating?How tragic!This time, she was no longer envious.……In the universe of the great path, Li Hao exhaled and smiled.Good!Over a hundred experts began to extract the power of the great Dao. The river began to stabilize and no longer shook violently.At this moment, they only needed to wait for time and wait for the next round of all the people to cultivate together.This night was extremely torturous for many people.The students of Yuanping martial arts university were going crazy.Hong Yitang and the others were also going crazy.In the hurricane city, Zheng Yu really wanted to walk out of his clone and kill Qian Wuliang who had been talking non-stop all night.However, Qian Wuliang was also at the seventh stage of the sun Moon realm. In the era where there were no saints, they didn't need to be afraid of him.Zheng Yu was also worried that he had fallen into this fellow's trap.After thinking about it, Hurricane city simply hid underground. 'I'll let you talk, what an annoying guy!'……The next day.It was dawn!Lin Hongyu's face appeared in the sky again. Her face was pale, but she was smiling brightly."Last night, many people who sincerely prayed for blessings received rewards from their heroic spirits!""According to the statistics, from yesterday day to today, 142 new sun and moon have been born on the bright star continent! The birth of the mountain and sea, 121, and thousands of Dou Qis!"There were more suns and moons than the mountains and seas.This number was not fake.Of course, the premise was to eliminate the hundred students from Yuanping martial arts university. Obviously, this number was not eliminated. Lin Hongyu controlled the sky screen and a group of people appeared instantly. They were all dressed in the clothes of the new era. They were all extremely young and there were many handsome men and beautiful women. However ... Their faces were weak and pale.It was that group of students.Her voice resounded through the world again,'these are a portion of the sun and moon experts that were born! Today, the newly-born sun and moon powerhouses would go to the major cities to give a speech and tell them about their successful experiences! "If there are any doubters, you can also challenge them ... I don't think you've seen these people before. They're all new and very young. Some of them are genius martial Dao students, and some of them came from some remote and small places, so they haven't seen much of the world. I'm sorry for using such words. I'm a little uncomfortable showing up in front of you today. I hope that when these new sun and moon students arrive in their respective cities, you'll be more tolerant ..."A group of students looked at the sky with a sad face and a dry smile.He looked especially shy and pale! Haven't seen the world?After being tormented for a night, you'll be like us ... You're just short of crying until you're hoarse. It's so painful!At this moment, these students rose into the air one by one and flew in all directions.This was their new mission!Impersonating a newbie to give everyone confidence ... To let everyone hold on for two more days.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  It had to be said that the people were excited yesterday and seemed a little impatient today. However, when these new sun and moon arrived in the various cities to promote ... In an instant, they exploded with incomparable excitement!These people were all strangers.He didn't know any of them, and he wasn't familiar with any of them. Obviously, they were indeed new powerhouses, and the power of great DAOs was still uncontrollably overflowing from their bodies. It was obvious that they hadn't mastered a new power!This was better than anything else. This was the best publicity!Li Hao, who had been worried that the power of his great Dao would not be as strong as the first day, soon realized that he had underestimated Lin Hongyu. The power of his great Dao on the second day seemed to be stronger and more exciting than the first day!More great Dao power continued to drop.As for Li Hao and the others, they were both in pain and in joy.The long river quickly began to spread.Originally, Li Hao had estimated that it would only increase by a third today. Who knew that there were still countless people cultivating at night? while Li Hao found it a little difficult to bear, the river had also completed three-quarters of the cycle.After tonight, he might succeed!……On the river of Dao, Li Hao was extremely excited, while Hong Yitang and black Panther had been paralyzed in the void for a long time, hugging each other for warmth.The auras of the man and the dog were both extremely powerful.At this moment, Hong Yitang's aura had even reached the Dao integration realm, which made him extremely happy and in pain. However ... He really couldn't take the remaining quarter!The Black Panther was in an even worse state than him. He had advanced to the seventh stage of the sun Moon realm, while the Black Panther had started at the fourth stage. At this moment, it was approaching the Dao integration stage. Half of its body was black, while the other half was golden. There were also some chaotic colors flashing continuously."I'm afraid that this is the only time we'll hold a universal cultivation like this ... I don't know if you'll believe me or not, but I'm sure you won't be as sincere as you are now!"Li Hao sighed with emotion. For the first time, everyone had really put in effort.The next time ... It would be hard to say.This was a rare opportunity!Besides, if there was a next time, he might not need it anymore.Seeing that there was still a quarter of it left, Li Hao exhaled. His body suddenly expanded, and he said with a smile,""Then I'll do it myself!"

In an instant, Dao meridians appeared in his body.In the blink of an eye, 36 Dao meridians appeared and completed a cycle.The peak of the ninth level of the sun Moon realm!In fact, he was even beginning to move directly towards the daomerge!Hong Yitang raised his eyebrows slightly and glanced at Li Hao's body ... In confusion. This body ... Didn't seem right. New Dao meridians seemed to be activated temporarily.What was going on?Li Hao should have activated his Dao Meridian a long time ago, but not fully.However, these Dao meridians seemed to have just been completed.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao chuckled and glanced at them. He suddenly sent a voice transmission,"Martial uncle, how much do I look like in the past?"“……”Hong Yitang was speechless. What did he mean?The next moment, he seemed to have thought of something and his expression changed."A clone?"That's impossible, right?Could it be that he and everyone else had been meeting with his clone over the past two days?Li Hao was too skilled in creating a physical body!Li Hao smiled without saying anything!Yes, a clone.In other words, not counting his clone, his consciousness, divine runes, and so on were all in this physical body. It was just that ... His real physical body had sunk to the bottom of the river!Use the power of 10000 DAOs to nurture it!Of course, the one at the bottom of the river was just an empty shell. Everything else was in Li Hao's current body.However, this body was indeed something he had created on the spot.This was what it meant to Steal the Sky and change the sun!As for Hong Yitang, he was extremely shocked. If this was a clone, then where was Li Hao's real body?He looked around ... And soon, his gaze fell on the river. Could it be ... Impossible?This ... Was unbelievable!This kid was too bold!BOOM!With a loud noise, Li Hao's aura soared, and he reached the Dao integration level in an instant. This time, his great Dao did not fluctuate much, because Li Hao had already reached the Dao integration level before.However, Li Hao's aura was even more intense than before!"The remaining quarter should be enough for me to reach the second level of the Dao integration stage! If it's completed in the end, I might be able to reach the third level of the Dao integration stage!"The third level of the Dao integration realm was the true peak of the sage realm!And this was Li Hao's goal this time.His clone had reached the third level of the Dao integration realm.After completing 36 cycles, he would enter the first level of Dao integration. After completing 72 cycles, he would enter the second level of Dao integration. After completing 108 cycles, he would reach the third level of Dao integration. Of course, whether he could reach the peak of the third level was still a problem.Li Hao didn't care about this. He was focused on cultivation. The power of countless great DAOs gathered in his body, and the river flowed rapidly and continuously.To have billions of people provide me with resources and power for my cultivation at once ... I'm probably the first in history to achieve this, right?Perhaps the Supreme human King had done it in the past, but ... What kind of strength do I have?Li Hao was very satisfied! His investment in the people had finally paid off. Although he didn't ask for anything in return, it was still very satisfying to have something in return.……The blessing continued.That night, countless people were still cultivating. The news of people breaking through kept coming. In addition, a large number of monster plants were sprinkling the spring of life everywhere, which made countless people excited.That night, the entire haoxing continent was immersed in the joy of cultivation.And that night ... Another batch of heaven-battling Army embarked on the road of recovery.Li Hao's promise to revive the students of Yuanping martial arts university and the heaven-battling Army was in progress.In the stellarsky city. Lin Hongyu was no longer giving commands. Instead, she sat down cross-legged and cultivated. A large amount of power of 10000 DAOs appeared, causing her great pain. However, her eyes were getting brighter!As Li Hao's spokesperson, he had to be strong enough!Now, there was no lack of the seven levels of sun and moon.There were even quite a few Saints.She had only been at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier before, but her aura had soared to the peak of the ninth level ... And it was still rising. From the looks of it, she might even be able to enter the Dao integration stage!Of course, she also knew that if she could reach the Dao integration stage ... Perhaps she would be able to walk out of the sage realm.It was faster than he had expected!Zheng Yu might not have noticed that Qian Wuliang's existence had temporarily blocked his perception of the outside world, but he would sense it sooner or later. However, no saint would come out immediately.There weren't many saints left in the ancient city.Li Hao also had many saints."In just over 20 days, the world has recovered once again ... This means that the great Dao is stronger, and so is the world!"Li Hao must have become even more powerful!She was looking forward to it and was excited.He wondered if Li Hao would be able to reach the second or even third level of Dao integration!……In the Dao universe.The sword-shaped River was about to be completed. At this moment, Li Hao shouted,""Uncle-master, Black Panther, stay away, the connection is about to succeed!"Just a little bit more. There might be a huge change later!In the next moment, the head and tail of the river began to connect.BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the universe.Suddenly, the sound of waves could be heard. It was as if a Great River was surging. In the blink of an eye, the long river seemed to engulf the entire universe. The sound of the river shook the starry sky and countless stars decorated it!At this moment, the time star that had disappeared earlier suddenly reappeared!Li Hao's expression changed drastically!The word "Dao" appeared in a hurry. Hong Yitang and black Panther, who were far away, fell into silence instantly. The entire surging River also quieted down as if time had stopped.Superstar media hovered around for a while, as if it was very interested in the long river.He suddenly fell and entered the river!At this moment, the river seemed to be endowed with some special power. The huge star seemed to be swimming in the river, and it seemed to be in a good mood ...

Chapter 2254 The Galaxy Is Formed, And He Re-Enters The Dao Integration Stage (1)
Very soon, the huge star finished swimming and disappeared with a Whoosh!Li Hao's expression changed.Terrifying!The long river started to shake again. However, it was different from the previous feeling of being forcefully piled up. It was more stable!  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "It's a good thing ... But ... How many days have passed this time?"He felt a little helpless. This time, it might have been a few days!The stars were no longer shining. Clearly, everyone had stopped cultivating."Martial uncle, Heibao!"Li Hao shouted. The man and the dog woke up and didn't seem to care. Black Panther, on the other hand, vaguely knew that he had been frozen, but Hong Yitang knew nothing.It was not until Li Hao tore open the void and sensed it that he realized that three days had passed.Good, good!He heaved a sigh of relief and didn't dare to delay any longer. He quickly began to absorb the power of the river. Countless powers poured in, and a large amount of power of the great Dao opened up Dao meridians.72 messages!Soon, Li Hao completed the 72 Dao meridians and the two circulations.At this point, he could be considered to have truly reached the second level of Dao integration.Li Hao, on the other hand, was still absorbing the power of the river. He had already surpassed his previous self. Previously, he had opened more than 80 meridians, but it was too messy. This time, all of them were elemental Dao meridians!It was more integrated and more compatible with him!One Dao Meridian after another was activated. 80 ... 85 ....Hong Yitang and Heibao also started to sort out their Dao meridians.The power of 10000 DAOs swept through the area. The man and dog were also improving rapidly.As for Li Hao, while he was training, he also began to slowly sort out a star that had sunk to the bottom of the river. Not only did he sort it out, he also helped the star get rid of a large amount of impurities.In the end, after some thought, he allowed the entire star to flow in the long river and no longer hang in the sky. It was Lin Hongyu's star!From then on, her Dao would be at the bottom of the river. Even if the Galaxy was broken, as long as no one found the long river, her Dao would not be broken!However, the concealment of the river was a problem.Now, it was too conspicuous.Li Hao considered this while he cultivated. Soon, the river seemed to turn into a person and began to sink, while billions of stars were still floating in the air, illuminating the universe. The human-shaped River continued to sink ... Li Hao watched for a while, but he was still worried. It was only sinking, not completely disappearing ... Perhaps ... He should do something. For example, he could teleport heaven battling city and a few other major cities in between ... The stars were in the sky, the cities were below, and the Galaxy was below the cities!This wasn't a difficult thing.At this moment, Li Hao's smile was extremely bright.He had finally completed the initial construction.After this ... I'll be even more confident!The cultivation continued for some time.After an unknown period of time, Li Hao opened his eyes. The Dao meridians in his body trembled slightly. In an instant, 99 Dao meridians floated outside his body. Li Hao took a look and was a little disappointed."He hasn't reached the third level of Dao integration. He only has 99 Dao meridians ... The power of his great Dao is starting to solidify!"On one side, Hong Yitang and Heibao had also come to their senses. At this moment, they were both speechless.99 posts!Are you still not satisfied?Hong Yitang was a little disappointed."I've only opened 38 Dao meridians. I'm still lacking ..."Black Panther didn't want to speak at all!These two, what are they showing off for?I should have the battle power close to that of a Saint. Did I say anything?……At the same time.In the military governor's office in Sky Star City, Lin Hongyu, who had been in seclusion for a few days, walked out of the mansion.He looked at the sky outside and smiled.The great Dao was no longer in chaos.It was much smoother than before, but it seemed a little murky. However, she had become much stronger, and she had also reached the Dao integration level."Did you succeed?"She mumbled. She must have succeeded.It had been three days since the blessing of the people ended.Now that the world has recovered to the point where it can accommodate Saints, if it fails ... It shouldn't be so. Besides, I've already reached the Dao integration stage, so you should be stronger than before!At this moment, the sky was torn apart, and two people and a dog floated down.At that moment, Lin Hongyu was suddenly a little jealous ... Hong Yitang, don't you think that you're snatching someone else's position?

He was back.This time, Li Hao had stayed in the Dao universe for almost a month.Although he had come out halfway, this could be the first time he had gone into closed-door cultivation to investigate.Today, Li Hao was even more ethereal, as if he was above the common populace."Lord Marquis!"Lin Hongyu stepped forward and greeted him.Hong Yitang sized him up and smiled. He then looked at Li Hao and said,""I'll go take a look at the situation at the Institute of martial arts first. You and Governor Lin can discuss what to do next."Li Hao nodded slightly.Heibao wanted to continue following, but he was dragged away by Hong Yitang.It was nothing at first, but when Hong Yitang dragged the dog away, Li Hao felt a little helpless.Lin Hongyu smiled and said,""It's been a long time since the Marquis has come to the governor's office. Come in and have a seat. "Li Hao nodded slightly.The two of them walked toward the main hall of the governor's office, one in front and one behind.In the distance, Hong Yitang dragged the Black Panther and turned his head to take a look. He laughed. How interesting.……In the main hall.Li Hao lifted his chin when he saw Lin Hongyu standing there."Have a seat."Lin Hongyu sat up straight.Li Hao smiled and said,"you did well this time. It was perfect!" Everything is going smoothly, and he is commanding the entire nation to cooperate. There are billions of xiuzhe, and this is unprecedented!""You should have reached the Dao integration stage, right?""Yes."Lin Hongyu nodded slightly."It's a little difficult. If I fight some weak Saints, I might have a chance. If I encounter some senior saints ...""There aren't many experienced Saints!"​ Li Hao laughed,"it's just Zheng Yu's side. The rest are all useless. The true experts have long left the Silvermoon world!" Now, we're just fighting a bunch of fuckheads!""Lord Marquis ... Heaven battling city's forces also have Saints,"Although he was scolding them, he couldn't say it like this. If he did, the Saints of heaven battling city would also be very helpless. Li Hao laughed."I'm not talking about them. They're neo martial Saints to begin with. I'm talking about Zheng Yu's side. They're a bunch of imposters. They reached the undying level a long time ago, but they haven't fought or truly entered the Saint level. They've only come into contact with the great Dao of origin. Their physical body and vitality have only reached that level."Most of the Saints now were water Saints.It didn't have the blessing of the origin ... It couldn't be compared to neo martial.Li Hao was too lazy to compare.Now, he was using the Dao integration realm to compare with these Saints. If he reached the third level of the Dao integration realm, he could defeat a group of Saints, even if he was a peak Saint. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "Let's not talk about this. Did anything big happen recently?""A little, but it's not a big deal. The world has returned to normal. Director Zhao, Qian Wuliang, and sky sword have entered the eighth level of the sun Moon realm. Almost everyone from Yuanping martial arts university has entered the sun Moon realm, and a few have even entered the seventh level of the sun Moon realm.""Director Wang has also entered the 8th level of the sun Moon realm. As for the Demon Hunter guards, Liu Yan has entered the 7th level ..."She explained everything one by one, so she understood the situation very clearly.Speaking of this, he added,"on the Yao plant Army's side, the Emperor guards and a few Yao plants are all comprehending the new Dao, but they haven't officially shifted their Dao yet. These few people's idea is to first leave the great Dao stars in the Galaxy, and then imperceptibly transplant the great Dao naturally to maintain a complete power transfer ..."Li Hao nodded slightly. This was feasible."Also, there was a riot in the ruins of star suppression city ... We went to heaven battling city and found that there was no one inside, but there were traces of battle. Also, the turtle Guardian went to take a look and said that the throne might have been moved by someone. However, the recovery of the world is too fast, and we were busy with other things before and didn't have time to care about him. Ying Hongyue should have run away as soon as possible, and we don't know where she is now. ""Also ..."She paused for a moment before continuing,'the seal in the silver Blizzard city has been fluctuating a few times recently, and Zheng Yu is probably very nervous! Recently, the Silver Moon has been acting strangely at night. I don't know if something has happened to the seal, but Division Chief Zhang and the rest have not appeared. In the end, the Queen of the West disappeared, and it's unknown if she's still alive. "There weren't any major events, but there were a lot of minor ones.Li Hao kept nodding.The seal of the Silver Moon!Also, now that heaven and earth had recovered and could withstand Saints again, shouldn't li daoheng's side also come out?I wonder what he's thinking about in a month."Right, the last thing is about the general public. Recently, many experts have appeared among the people, including those from the mountains, seas, sun, and moon! Lord Marquis thinks that we should leave these people be, or should we recruit them into the Army ...""I don't care!"Li Hao said,"why do you care?" In the path of cultivation, it did not mean that all experts had to listen to one's orders ... As long as they followed the law, it was up to them whether they wanted to join the army of their own accord or become an unaffiliated cultivator! Cultivators are everywhere in the world now. In the mountains, seas, sun, and moon, there will be a large number of them sooner or later. It's impossible for them to all join the government. ""En!"Lin Hongyu nodded slightly. She glanced at Li Hao and said softly,""There's also a holy white religion that has been rather active recently. It's said that they've gathered many experts of all kinds. Some are dissatisfied with us, and there are also experts from the divine Kingdom, the great wilderness, the great li, and the water cloud continent. They're all people who are dissatisfied with the current situation.""It's said that their leader, Sage Chao Bai, was already a sun Moon expert some time ago. Now ... He might even have entered the late stage of Sun Moon!"

"In addition, there has been some turmoil in the Cang Mountain and kui mountain demon clans recently. The Snake King of kui mountain seems to have gathered many powerful demonic beasts ... However, I heard that there has been some conflict with the White saint cult recently. Both sides have had a small battle at the Cang Mountain and kui Mountain Front lines. I have sent people to take a look. I'm afraid that the sun and moon have participated in the battle!"She glanced at Li Hao, who smiled.""Yes, it's good. I arranged everything."As expected!Lin Hongyu was relieved. I knew it. The Snake King of Mount kui should be on Li Hao's side and had helped him earlier.In addition, she even knew that a few familiar greater demons had joined the lineage of Mount kui.Of course, Sage Chao Bai was Li Hao's arrangement ... She had thought about it before, but she wasn't sure. However, she was sure that the kui mountain demon clan should have a close relationship with Li Hao.This was unexpected.In that case, the rebels in the world were almost all wiped out in one fell swoop, leaving only a few people who were still causing trouble.After saying all this, she had nothing more to say.Seeing that she had stopped talking, Li Hao looked at her a few times. Seeing that she seemed to be in a daze, he coughed lightly.""Is there nothing else?""No,"Lin Hongyu replied stiffly. What else?There was nothing left!Li Hao chuckled. Lin Hongyu glanced at him, but when she saw Li Hao looking at her, she quickly lowered her head and looked away."There's one more thing that you've forgotten,"Li Hao said, smiling."What?""You forgot to tell me that no one objected to my announcement of marrying you or had any other reaction?"“……”Lin Hongyu was speechless. Why did she have to say that?Give me a name. You don't care anyway, so what's the point of saying it?"Is there really no objection?" Li Hao laughed again. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "No, I didn 't!"His answer was quite firm."That's good ..." Li Hao said after some thought."Next, I'm going to deal with a person. Tell the other Saints to seal off Hurricane city!""Ying Hongyue?""Right!"Li Hao nodded and didn't say anything else. He said softly,""Right now, Hurricane city can't be moved, and the one in the sky can't be moved. Only Ying Hongyue can be moved! I'm going to move him a little and test the reactions of all parties! In fact, you have forgotten one thing ... Heaven's will! The Heaven's Will would not dissipate so easily. Last time, only a portion of it had been destroyed. The Heaven's Will ... Would definitely choose another person to favor! Furthermore, this time, a true Son of Heaven might be born!""And this person ... You have to find a way to find him! He must have some sort of enmity with me, and he must be quite talented. He's received the favor of the heavens, so it's normal for him to rise to the next level in a single day. In fact, it's normal for him to reach the daomerge very quickly ..."Lin Hongyu's heart skipped a beat and she immediately nodded.""I know, I almost forgot about heaven's will. It's mainly because heaven's will is invisible, so I didn't pay much attention to it. Now that I think about it, I shouldn't have!" How could he forget about heaven's will?If not for Li Hao's reminder, she might have really forgotten. "It's not that you've forgotten, it's the Heaven's Will that represents heaven and earth. It will make people sink into it and naturally dissipate their hostility. The Heaven's Will is actually everywhere, what a terrifying fellow! You've always been in the world, so it's only natural that you'll let down your guard against it ..."Lin Hongyu nodded again with a serious expression.It was indeed terrifying!If the Heaven's Will had been targeting them, they might not have forgotten about it. But now, the Heaven's Will seemed to have matured a little. It did not target them, but it hid quietly and successfully made everyone forget about it."Alright, that's it. One last thing, during your recent cultivation, try to comprehend the five birds technique that my teacher left behind! I've helped you sort out the great DAOs, and they still don't seem to be perfect. However, as time passes, you'll discover that ... The power of 10000 DAOs will have a cycle that will help you cultivate in turn!"Lin Hongyu nodded again.Having said that, Li Hao stood up and prepared to leave.Lin Hongyu got up and followed behind him.However, Li Hao suddenly stopped. Lin Hongyu stopped as well. Li Hao turned around and saw that they were very close to each other. Li Hao asked,""Why didn't you crash into me?"“……”Lin Hongyu looked at him in a daze, not understanding what he meant.I'm a Dao integration stage super mighty figure, so I can even stop a centimeter away from him, let alone a little bit."I can control my power ..."Lin Hongyu replied in a daze. Li Hao laughed."You don't seem to have been in love before ..."“……”Lin Hongyu was stunned!"Aren't you craving my body? I thought you'd do what the novel says and hit me ..."“……”"Forget it. It seems like you're very busy. You don't even have time to read novels. You can read more. I've never talked about it, but I've read it. My master used to like it. You can read it too."“……”The next moment, Li Hao chuckled and disappeared.Lin Hongyu stared blankly in the direction he had disappeared. What was this?I've been so busy since I was young. I've been busy cultivating, scheming, dealing with all the rebels, managing the city of superpowers, and managing the star Empire. I've been so busy that I've never slept ... Do I have time to read any random books?Li Hao ... Was baffled!Also, wasn't li Hao busy?Wasn't Yuan Shuo busy?These people actually still had the mood to read those miscellaneous books. They were really ... Wasting their time!……Li Hao walked in the air and laughed. He suddenly found it interesting.

2257 Chapter 378
A 31-year-old woman ... From the looks of it, other than scheming and cultivation, she didn't seem to know much. How pitiful.His childhood must have been very boring.My childhood was quite interesting.Just as he was thinking, Hong Yitang floated over,""You're smiling very happily. Did you have a good chat?""It's alright!"Li Hao smiled."By the way, I haven't seen you for a long time, senior uncle Hong Xiu. What have you been busy with recently?"“……”Hong Yitang remained silent. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Li Hao frowned. Did something happen?I don't think so.Hong Xiu had almost never participated in a battle. Because she was Hong Yitang's wife and her strength was average, Li Hao had almost never summoned her to fight."He went to the divine Kingdom.""What?""He went to the divine Kingdom ..."After a moment of silence, he said,""She was at raincloud, and then she went to the great wastelands ... She adopted some of the old, weak, and lonely people who were left behind from the war. Heavenstar is still fine, but the divine Kingdom is in a miserable state. It's too chaotic, and there are countless deaths and injuries. I've advised her not to care about the divine Kingdom, but she didn't listen to me ..."Li Hao's heart moved."Boundless love ... Good news!"Even though he said that, he still pondered for a moment. A faint radiance of the great Dao overflowed from his body until his domain appeared."I have no opinion on this. It's actually pretty good. I'm just afraid that ... Heaven's will has its eyes on her!"Hong Yitang was shocked!"Her strength and talent are ordinary. Why would the Heaven's Will target her?""It's hard to say!"Li Hao frowned slightly.""I don't want my family to feel pain while my enemies feel joy. However, I'm not sure because it's very difficult for heaven's will to choose a person. Actually, I've thought about it before. I can choose either the Queen or Ying Hongyue ... But both of them have disappeared without a trace. The most likely possibility is that some people have never been to the great wilderness. For example ... The ninth Prince of the star royal family. And now, you said that martial uncle Hong Xiu has gone to the great wilderness and has been taking in some orphans. It's very easy for her to be targeted by heaven's will. Is this a kind of great love?""Ninth Prince ... You mean the disciple of the southern Fist?""Right!"Li Hao nodded."He's in star Martial Arts Academy now. It's very quiet, but his whole family is dead. Uncle-master Nanquan has also left. He's very talented, have you forgotten?" I didn't forget. I have a good memory! The star royal family was exterminated by me. At that time, martial uncle Nan Quan pleaded for him and let him stay. After martial uncle Nan Quan left, no one cared about him anymore. It's easy for things to change. "Hong Yitang couldn't help but sigh. Everyone had forgotten about this person, but Li Hao still remembered him.She was really ... Narrow-minded.However, that person was indeed quite talented.Thinking of this, he said,"that's right, we can observe her. As for Hong Xiu, I'll ask her to come back ...""No need!"Li Hao shook his head and suddenly smiled."If I really find senior uncle Hong Xiu, I'll give it a hard time later. At the same time, senior uncle Hong Xiu will make a fortune!" An immature heaven's will still wants to fight with all sides and even wants to cultivate its own spokesperson ... It's really thinking too much!"Speaking of this, he laughed and said,"let's not care about this. It's a good thing that the heavens favor us. Let's put it aside for the time being. Let's look for Ying Hongyue!" This time, I'm going to pluck all the feathers from this guy's body! He is a very important part of my next plan! Heibao, you come and find him!" "Woof!"The Black Panther cried out and sniffed around. Then, it stopped moving and could no longer smell anything.There was no smell at all!Li Hao was speechless. Trash!I raised you for nothing!However, it had to be said that Ying Hongyue could Dodge."Let's go, to the Li Dynasty!""The Li Dynasty?"Hong Yitang pondered for a while. Li Hao smiled and said,""The source of the forbidden Sea! If he wasn't in some of the ruins, he was over there! That grandson can Dodge! He might have seen something when he went to the ruins of Saturn city, but he has the Crimson Moon Power, so he could be easily injured by that saber. That saber is targeted at the Crimson Moon Power. If he wants to take the saber, he must remove a part of the Crimson Moon Power. The forbidden Sea is the best place for him to release the Crimson Moon Power silently ..."Li Hao's mind was clear at this moment.Ying Hongyue actually understood her quite well now.There was a 99% chance that he had returned to the Li Dynasty."The God of beginner martial of the Li Dynasty ..." Hong Yitang said in a deep voice.p "Don't worry! Zheng Yu doesn't care, li daoheng doesn't care, and the people of the Crimson Moon world don't look for trouble with him either ... This means that he might really be harmless, or rather, at this stage, it won't affect the interests of all parties!"Li Hao's explanation was clear and logical, so Hong Yitang could only nod.This guy was already good at scheming in the past, and now that he had cultivated, he was even better at scheming.It was normal for a guy who had been silent in the inspection Office for a year and read countless files in silence to be so calm in front of the red shadow ... To have many plans in his mind.……Li Dynasty.At the source of the forbidden Sea.In a place where huge waves swept up, the sea water corroded everything.Ying Hongyue was indeed here.At this moment, he let the seawater wash over him. Only the highly corrosive seawater could wash away the Crimson Moon Power in his body. Again and again, it took away a trace of the Crimson Moon Power.In his mind, he was still thinking about that saber!It was a very terrifying blade!From a distance, he could tell that it was extraordinary. If he could get it ... He might not need to plan anything anymore. Maybe ... He would be qualified to walk on the stage and compete with all parties!The bloodlines of the eight great families could be approached.As for him ... Perhaps he was born for these ruins.The bloodline of the eight great families ... I'm afraid someone deliberately guided me to gather it. He vaguely guessed who it was, but he didn't think about it or say it.

2258 Chapter 378
He had gained a lot from killing Zheng Yu's clone in the ruins of Star Town City.Today, he had once again returned to the Dao integration stage.The fusion of the power of the eight bloodlines was even higher.A wisp of the red moon's power was still dissipating, but it would soon appear again. This meant that the red moon sovereign was still permeating the power of the red moon, but it was much better than before. It was probably because Zhang an and the others had entered that the red moon sovereign slowed down."Li Hao has been in seclusion for a month, disappeared for a month, and the people of Heavenly Star have been praying for a few days ... Li Hao might be preparing for something."He thought to himself,"also, Li Hao should have seen that saber before."He didn't care too much about the feeling. Did he think that he couldn't get it, or was he thinking that when he became stronger, he would get it and he would benefit from it?Just as he was thinking, his expression suddenly changed.Something was wrong!The moment he sensed that something was wrong, the void split open and the word "Dao" domain appeared. In an instant, a Jade-white palm pierced through the void and slammed down with a bang!Ying Hongyue's expression changed drastically. Her eight great bloodlines instantly fused together, and her aura instantly skyrocketed as she also punched out!BOOM!A huge sound reverberated in all directions. Huge waves surged into the sky, and countless forbidden seawater churned!Bang Bang Bang!After a series of palm strikes, Ying Hongyue's bloodline suddenly trembled. A long sword appeared and started to shake violently. The eight great bloodlines instantly trembled. Ying Hongyue instantly dove into the sea and was about to escape.At this moment, an earth-covered sword appeared in the sea. A huge golden dog appeared, devouring the world and slashing the firmament! BOOM!Ying Hongyue emerged from the water, and her expression changed slightly.They were surrounded from the front and back!Earthcover sword, Black Panther, and Li Hao."Li Hao!""You wouldn't dare to kill me!" Ying Hongyue said in a deep voice. If you kill me, someone else will deal with you!"Li Hao appeared and smiled gently.""I know, so ... I'm not in a hurry to kill you. I'll just severely injure you and raise you like a pig in a jar. What do you think?"Ying Hongyue's expression changed as she continued to probe her surroundings.Li Hao chuckled and said,"stop looking. You can't escape!" The world is only so big, unless you escape to Hurricane city and once again be under Zheng Yu's control, otherwise ... Where are you going?"Li Hao smiled."I don't want much. You can't digest the power of the Crimson Moon. Give me some, and I'll digest it for you. It'll reduce the pressure on you and make your eight bloodlines more compatible!"Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. Li Hao smiled."It's fine. I've always liked to benefit from each other. I've been improving too fast recently, and the great path lightning hasn't struck me a few times, so I feel a little uncomfortable. I'll be quite satisfied if you can get me some great path lightning!"Ying Hongyue's eyes flickered for a moment, and she also smiled."You only want the power of the Crimson Moon? That's not a problem. I have too much and I think it's too troublesome. I can give you however much you want ... If I give it to you, will you let me go?"Li Hao shook his head."You've given me the Crimson Moon. I don't think you mind giving me something else, right?""What do you want?" Ying Hongyue's expression changed."Where's the purple Moon?""What?"Ying Hongyue was startled. She looked at Li Hao and suddenly smiled."You ... Don't tell me you're still interested in my daughter? When Qian Wuliang came to the Li Dynasty, the king of the Li Dynasty led his Army and killed her ... It's going to be difficult to find her!"In the distance, Hong Yitang was also stunned."If we don't talk about business, what do you want Ziyue for?"Almost all of the seven moons were dead. Ziyue was not the first Ziyue, but the third. She was the daughter of Ying Hongyue and black Widow. At that time, many people from the three major organizations had died in Silver Moon. This one, on the other hand, was still alive even though she was captured.According to Ying Hongyue, she had died in the Li Dynasty."Where's the purple Moon?"Li Hao chuckled.Ying Hongyue frowned."Dead ... If you don't believe me, you can ask Qian Wuliang and the king of Dali. Li Hao, as an Overlord, if you want to deal with me, you can just do it directly. Why do you have to do this?"Li Hao laughed again."You've protected both flying sword immortal and Heavenly Mountain Lord. Would you let Ziyue die?""It's different. Those two are useful to me!"Li Hao chuckled."Fine. You're stubborn. Do you want me to expose you?""What do you mean?"Ying Hongyue looked at him and slightly furrowed her brows."Li Hao ... I admit that I'm no match for you right now. Why do you need to be so mysterious?"Li Hao sighed."You seem to have given birth to a lot of children. There are men and women. You even have a lot of grandsons. Ziyue, you seem to value them a lot ...""I'm passionate, not heartless!""My woman and my descendants are all very important to me!" Ying Hongyue said in a carefree manner."Don't disgust me. "Li Hao laughed,"you're just a heartless person. Why are you acting like you have feelings?" I didn't understand it before, but I have a good memory and a small tolerance. I still remember the purple Moon! Although he was just a small figure, on second thought, a small figure could be of great use! You possess the power of the Crimson Moon and the bloodline of the eight great families ... How could someone like you possibly give birth to a child? Whose intelligence are you insulting?""If you can really give birth to one ... That'd be crazy. Do you really have to make yourself a cuckold? Your children ... I think they're all test subjects! Some failed, some succeeded. Ziyue should have succeeded ...""What do you mean?" Ying Hongyue's expression was normal. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "I don't know,"Li Hao shook his head,"the purple Moon is either made up of pure Crimson Moon Power or the bloodline power of the eight great families. There's no third possibility!" Of course, it's also possible that it's the product of a complete fusion ... But the possibility isn't high. If that's the case, you wouldn't be like this now!"

2259 Chapter 378
At this point, Li Hao laughed."You don't have any descendants. Don't try this with me. People like you will never have any offspring. Where do you have any descendants?" A large number of your descendants have died, and Ziyue has been following you all the way, so she won't die so easily ... Just tell me directly, did she sneak into the seal, or did you leave her in the ruins of star suppression city?"She then added,'perhaps ... The flying sword immortal who's still alive is actually Ziyue in disguise? You've left him in Hurricane city ... Don't tell me you want to trick Zheng Yu again?"“……”Ying Hongyue didn't say anything.But as he looked at Li Hao, he was ... Slightly shaken.After a long time, he slowly said, Li Hao, you think too much!"No, no, no, I've never thought too much!"Li Hao shook his head and said,"the purple Moon is good at lightning, right?" And from what I know, the Hong family is actually called the Thunder City! The Hong family's main city had never appeared. It had disappeared until today and still had not appeared! Also, you definitely have the bloodline of one of the eight great families ... In addition, the first divine weapon you threw to me was the Hong family's Thunderbolt hammer! "I destroyed it directly ... Then, the Hong family disappeared completely. Without the divine weapon, it was hard to find them. I can't even find the corresponding side of the eight blood veins that were sealed ... What if I call you Hong Hongyue?" Or Hong yingyue? Or Hong something?"Li Hao smiled and said,"Zi Yue must have the bloodline of the Hong family, one of the eight great families ... So, it's likely that it's a combination of the eight great families" bloodlines!" Although there are superpowers in the Dao of lightning, but ... After I mastered the Dao, I have explored almost all the powerful lightning stars, but I have not found that special purple lightning!""Speaking of which, you and my martial uncle are from the same family!"Li Hao laughed and said,"tell me, where is the Hong family's Thunder City?" What was he planning? Could it be that the Hong family, which rose in the post-neo martial era, also wants a share of the loot?"Ying Hongyue's expression remained calm,"just because Ziyue has the Dao of lightning, you're sure that I'm from the Hong family?" Perhaps I'm from the Li family?""Guess what my title was back in Silver Moon?" I ... Am actually good at swordsmanship!"Li Hao nodded."I know. The amorous swordsman Ying Hongyue. But ... Who cares?"He laughed."Ying Hongyue, we should know each other very well. You know me, and I know you. Zheng Yu and the others don't know you, but I actually know you. You and I complement each other. You see, although the hatred is as deep as the sea, I killed your wife, and you killed my entire family ... Didn't we support each other and come to this day?" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "I won't expose you ... If you can take care of Zheng Yu or the one in the sky, I'll give you a round of applause! I like to fight with the Silvermoon people, and I don't like them to become the protagonists of this era! I won't ask where the purple Moon went ... Nor will I expose you. However, other than the Crimson Moon's power, you have to give me something else. ""Speak!"Ying Hongyue glanced at him, and her tone was somewhat deep. "Control of a part of the seal!" Li Hao chuckled."To put it simply, it's the method you used to absorb the seal's power ... It should be related to the Hong family. Back then, only the eight major cities had such an ability ... Otherwise, how did you merge into the seal?" The Hong family's stone gate is in Silver City, and if I'm not wrong ... The Hong family's main city is most likely under Silver City, but it's very deep ...""How is that possible?" Ying Hongyue couldn't help laughing.Li Hao shook his head."Don't say it. If you say it, even I want to go and check it out. The first stone gate I saw belonged to the Hong family! You've been wreaking havoc in the Silver City for a long time, and you've already set your eyes on the eight great families. You've even offered yourself to be someone else's chess piece, the red moon Emperor's chess piece, Zheng Yu's chess piece, li daoheng's chess piece ... You're really amazing! My master's talent may be greater than yours, but in other aspects ... He's really not as good as you. Of the thirty-six heroes, you're the most treacherous!""There are many clues. If we link them together, we can actually find out something. It's not like I haven't studied you before. How could I not study the guy who killed my entire family?"Li Hao laughed and said,"also ... Is the purple Moon your real body?" Get Ying Hongyue out to divert attention? If that's the case ... You're amazing! Of course, it didn't matter! First do what I want you to do, then we'll talk about the rest. Otherwise, whether it's your real body or your fake body, you won't be able to leave today!"Ying Hongyue raised her brows and only spoke after a long while,"I can give you the Crimson Moon's power. As for the seal authority you mentioned ... How do I give it to you?" My body is sealed, and you want to do the same? If that's the case ... I don't mind, but I'm afraid you'll fall into it and be unable to extricate yourself!""Come on!"Li Hao laughed."I'll give you ten seconds to think about it. Give me the authority. Or ... I'll dig out the Hong family's Thunderbolt city!" Perhaps he's not in the silver Blizzard city, but in the seal ... That would be even more interesting!"Ying Hongyue looked at him for a while and cursed in her heart!This guy was a real monster!How did he think of the purple Moon?How could he have thought of the ordinary power of lightning?How could he have thought that the Hong family was called Thunder City ... And how low-profile the Hong family was!The eight major cities, everyone thought that the Hong family had officially been destroyed!The world was in turmoil, and the Hong family had not appeared. The old turtle and the others felt that the Hong family might have been completely destroyed, and the ancient city might have been completely buried ... Otherwise, why would they not appear?
