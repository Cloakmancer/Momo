The red moon world was very big, and there were many venerable sovereigns, and naturally, there were even more Heavenly Kings.There were also many Heavenly Kings who charged at them without regard for anything else. There were a group of heroes in every world. Seeing the destruction of the world and the death of the venerable sovereigns, these Heavenly Kings also charged madly!Boom! Boom! Boom!Countless corpses were smashed into pieces and blood flowed like a river!Hong Yue had nearly a hundred venerable sovereigns. Some had died earlier, some were struck to death by the Thunderbolts, and another group was slaughtered by Li Hao's group. The last group was fighting with Senlan's venerable sovereigns!The heavens and earth were shattering!Both sides had people dying.There were also venerable sovereigns who were escaping.However, with the Thunder tribulation, how could it be so easy to escape? furthermore, there were two great Dao universes circling outside. As long as one was not too powerful, they would be killed on the spot!Slaughter!This time, it wasn't considered stealing, but directly destroying the house!In fact, it went much smoother than Li Hao had expected.Li Hao was also panting from the massacre, and Kong Ji was also a little powerless. Although he could recover, he had to recover as well. He and Li Hao had been targeting the middle-stage venerable sovereigns and had killed countless of them.At this time, a sixth level venerable sovereign covered in blood flew over from the distance. He said with a sorrowful expression,""You ... Are all executioners! Even if I, Hong Yue, am your enemy, many venerable sovereigns are innocent. Aren't you afraid of retribution for killing so many venerable sovereigns?"Li Hao didn't say a word and slashed at it with his sword!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  There was nothing much to say.This person cultivated the Dao of sorrow. If he replied, he would only doubt himself.Li Hao wasn't as kind as he had imagined.He didn't know why he gave people the illusion that he was very kind.My enemies, strong or weak, how many of them are still alive?The long sword slashed out!At this moment, the five elements domain appeared and pressed down. A powerful battle strength burst out instantly. Although Li Hao was only at the peak of the fourth stage, the strength he displayed at this moment was not weaker than that of the sixth stage!With a loud boom, the sixth rank venerable sovereign's body was directly shattered. Kong Ji waved his hand casually, and silence, death, and darkness appeared, shrouding the surroundings. With a crack, a Red Moon was shattered.With the two of them working together, a sixth-tier would be a piece of cake, and a seventh-tier would be more or less the same.Of course, the two of them were no match for the seventh-rank.A large number of venerable sovereigns had fallen. At this moment, the Thunderbolts had almost dissipated. It was unknown if the Tribulation was over, or if Red Moon master had been struck to death, or if the power of the rules given by the great Dao Alliance was only so much.There were many damaged areas in the entire world.There were corpses everywhere, and there were cries and screams everywhere. Countless cultivators were also flying and burrowing, fleeing in all directions.In the distance, Supreme Emperor Yan Fang had killed the last of the rebels. He quickly led the other venerable sovereigns to join Li Hao's group.At this moment, Yan Fang was also extremely shocked.He suppressed the throbbing in his heart. He didn't expect that the powerful level 8 world would not be broken by neo martial artists, but by Li Hao, the Silver Moon King, and his team!Some of Senlan's venerable sovereigns had also died, but they had suffered losses."Fellow Daoist myriad Daoist," he said quickly,"we have killed 19 venerable sovereigns, seven of our own, and three of our venerable sovereigns have died under the lightning tribulation ... Senlan ... Has lost 10 venerable sovereigns!"He glanced at Li Hao, and Li Hao glanced at Supreme Emperor Sen LAN. The living didn't seem to be too sad, because many of them were from the path master's lineage.It was doubtful as to how the 10 of them died.Of course, this was not within Li Hao's consideration. He nodded and said,""This time, forest world has contributed greatly ... We'll talk about everything after the war!""Everyone, I'll have to trouble you for a bit more ...""Senior Li Zhu," he said, looking at Li Zhu in the distance."I'll have to trouble you and Daoist Kong Ji to lead everyone to take down the remaining two realms!""Today, I will break the Four Realms!"Lizhu moved slightly."Are you letting us go?"p You ... What do you want to do?Although he wasn't sure, he didn't say much and just nodded.""Alright!"It just so happened that he could also contribute a little.He hadn't really made a move yet.Li Hao looked at Yan Fang."If we can take down the Four Realms this time, Senlan's contribution will be undeniable. We will definitely gain something!"Yan Fang thought to himself and nodded his head, not rejecting the offer.Although he was a little worried and only wanted to be cannon fodder, the realm Lord seemed to trust this person quite a lot. He didn't say anything. Soon, he led the rest of the venerable sovereigns and rushed out of the realm with Li Zhu and the others.Li Hao flew quickly and appeared in front of King Huai's group in the blink of an eye. He glanced at them and laughed."You guys haven't left yet, that's good! Since we've already reached this stage ... It seems like sector Lord Sen LAN has done something. At this moment, if we can't take down the great Dao universe, then we'll have suffered a great loss. The three of you, follow me and enter the great Dao universe!"At this point, if he still planned to use the power of the world and the power of a great Dao like before ... He would be underestimating Li Hao.This time, I'll even take the Dao universe!The three of them were so excited that they did not dare to say anything. They quickly presented their DAOs. Li Hao attached himself to them and merged with their DAOs. In an instant, he entered a universe, which was somewhat broken.Countless stars were destroyed!The power of intense desire swept over him. Li Hao frowned slightly, but he didn't say anything.There were too many desires, too many of them!He reached out his hand, and in the next moment, the void seemed to be broken, and a man appeared. Qian Wuliang was shocked, and Li Hao said,""There's no need to stand guard for the time being, you lead the way!"

Chapter 3021 Great Harvest!
"Lord Marquis, the power of desire is too strong!" Qian Wuliang said in a hurry."It's so dense. I'm worried that ... If I open a path for myself and absorb too much, I'll ... Lose control.Although I also train in the Dao of emotions, I'm still a cultivator.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  But ... It was still a little different. Emotions could be controlled, but desires were hard to control."You and King Huai are together!""Me?" King Huai was startled."Right, desire ... The most important thing is restraint. Who doesn't have desire? As long as you can control it, you will be the Masters of desire. If you can't ... You will be the slaves of desire. I have high hopes for the two of you. Although the two of you ... Are weak, you can definitely control desire!"As for the remaining two, he looked at the referee and Chan Xiu.""You two, stay here for a while. Don't follow us, it's too dangerous!"The two wandering cultivators were a little embarrassed, but they didn't say anything.They ... Once they entered the great Dao universe, they couldn't suppress their desires. Some wanted to restrain themselves, but it was difficult to.As for Qian Wuliang and King Huai, although they were young, one was the master of the great Dao, and the other was a guy who had experienced neo martial arts and survived. Their control of desire was beyond ordinary people 's.Li Hao quickly said, let's go and find the origin of the great Dao! The origin of great DAOs is the core of the entire universe. It's like Time and Stars. If we control the origin of great DAOs, this part of the universe will be ours!""Then Red Moon master ...""If he could still control it, would he have waited until now? Something must have happened now. He must have been struck by lightning. Not only him, but the others are probably the same. If that's the case ... Whether it's the human King, the other level eight venerable sovereigns, or even the level Seven venerable sovereigns, will they let him go?"Li Hao smiled."Right now, his only way to survive is to give up the Crimson Moon universe and become a wandering cultivator. He'll be rid of the power of the lightning tribulation and leave the great Dao universe. The lightning tribulation shouldn't strike him. Although he'll be much weaker, it's ... His capital to survive! Without the lightning tribulation and the great path universe, the price to pay to kill a level eight is too great, and the gains are not proportional. This way, it's possible to make the two level eights give up on hunting him!"The two understood immediately. King Huai quickly said,"He hasn't given up yet, has he?""No, the great Dao universe hasn't completely declined. This means that he hasn't extracted enough power of the great Dao ... What we need to do is not to prevent him from leaving, but to make sure that he can take less energy with him after he leaves and retain more power of the great Dao!"Understood!The two of them didn't say anything more and quickly opened up a path, following the direction where the desire was the strongest.Li Hao, on the other hand, kept suppressing the power of desire!The red moon master might not be willing to leave at this moment. Maybe ... I should give him a chance to make a decision. As for whether the human King can kill him ... It's not easy to judge at the moment.Now, the other party was definitely not dead.It wouldn't be so quiet if he was dead. ……Soon, Li Hao arrived in the depths of the universe.At this moment, he saw a huge star that was like a heart. It was a Red Moon, and countless power of desire was overflowing from it.Fame, fortune, joy, greed, power, women, power ...At this moment, King Huai and the other man were somewhat out of control. Li Hao, on the other hand, quickly suppressed the two of them under his own River. This huge moon seemed to be beating a little, and with each beat, an image seemed to appear.That represented the red moon Lord's desire.In the end, there was a scene of the destruction of new martial arts, entering level nine, and unifying chaos. The red moon Lord in the picture was exceptionally crazy and demonic.All of this was a desire that he could not let go of!Li Hao was also in a daze at this moment, as if he had been affected. It was too strong. The power of desire at the eighth-rank was dominated by desire and became a slave to it!And Li Hao naturally had his own desires.At this moment, a scene appeared in his mind.It was as if he had returned to the past ... Back to many years ago.His parents were still alive, and his childhood friend was still alive. He seemed to be directly immersed in his past memories, unable to extricate himself.This was an eighth-tier universe!In his memories, the world was peaceful. There were no superpowers, no slaughter. It was just that peaceful ... He would grow up happily, forever.At this moment, in the river, er Mao was woken up and was a little shocked.Not good!Just as he was about to interfere, Li Hao suddenly sighed.""Desire is really a good thing! No wonder everyone likes it, I like it too ..."Li Hao opened his eyes, and the two cats were stunned.You ... You've left?This was a level-eight great Dao universe!Li Hao lowered his head, looked at second cat in the river, and smiled.""I'm just giving it a try. It's too fake. If I really wanted to ... I would have gone back in time and immersed myself in the past forever, just like you! I can't do it?"I can do it!I'm not willing!"I have desires, but they definitely can't be satisfied by the great Dao of desire. Even my Dao of time can't give me the truest desires, so what can a rank 8 Dao like yours give me?A fake look!I even thought that my way of time was not powerful enough and not realistic enough. You created an illusion of desire. Li Hao wanted to say ... Who are you looking down on?It was not that the great Dao was not strong, but that he had a better choice.In that case, this illusion of desire was naturally not a problem for him. He was just trying it out and found that it was nothing much!Li Hao suddenly grinned."Senior second cat, I want to ... Dismantle it!"Second cat was stunned. What do you want to tear down?

"Dismantle the path of desire!"After saying that, time rapidly reversed, and Li Hao became even older. He laughed."That's right, I'm going to dismantle the core Dao source of an eighth-level universe. I'll do it before Red Moon master runs away!"'If the other party senses it and runs away with moon, there's nothing I can do about it. But ... I still have a chance!'He quickly turned back time!The next moment, his eyes lit up, and he suddenly rushed into the red moon. In an instant, a great Dao was torn out by him. It seemed to be the Dao of anger!……At the same time.Red Moon master was still resisting the Thunder tribulation, which was about to dissipate. He was unwilling to run away and give up the great path universe to become a rogue cultivator. Therefore, even if he was besieged, he wanted to hold on for a while!As long as the lightning tribulation completely dissipated, he would still have the power to counterattack.However, at this moment, his expression changed!It's finished!He knew that the rank seven AI Hong was dead. He also knew that almost all the other venerable sovereigns had been killed.He also knew that the great Dao universe was shaking.However, as long as he didn't die, the master of the Dao universe wouldn't change, and it wouldn't be taken away ...However, at this moment, he suddenly sensed something. Someone had entered the daosource!He had not been swallowed by desire!That person, not only was he not devoured, he ... He seemed ... Seemed to be ... Tearing apart his Dao source?Was it?He couldn't believe it!How could this be?Who was it?BOOM!When the divine light fist struck, the radiant sovereign couldn't help but sigh. What a powerful fellow. He really wasn't going to be easy to take down. The lightning tribulation was about to end. If he didn't take down this fellow soon, things would become even more difficult.He wouldn't be able to escape, right?Just as she was thinking about this, the great Dao of Red Moon master, who was originally still resisting, seemed to have some fluctuations this time. She actually didn't have time to defend herself, and with a boom, she was sent flying by a punch from the God of Light!In the next moment, the lightning struck!It seemed that this might be the last lightning tribulation. If he survived it, he wouldn't have to face it anymore.However, at this moment ... Red Moon master did not feel any joy at all. There was only madness and anger!Someone was destroying the land of Dao origin!Damn it!If this continued, he would lose control of his power."Bastard!"Today was really an unlucky day. He roared,"you forced me to do this!""That's good ... Good!"You forced me! They're all forcing me!"Then I'll give up the level-eight universe and the Crimson Moon today. From today on, I'm the Rogue cultivator, Crimson Moon!"A wandering cultivator ... Without any restraints, you will regret it.Neo martial was feared by others because Emperor Cang could drag a great world and escape at will. The others had some restrictions.But today ... This group of people forced me!BOOM!At this moment, a Red Moon appeared and covered the entire universe. On the red moon, there was actually ... A person.Red Moon master finally saw who it was.He gritted his teeth,"Silver Moon King!" Good, very good! So it's you!" The radiant master and the others were stunned. At this moment, the other party had actually left the great Dao universe, and ... From the looks of it, the Silver Moon King seemed to have ... Directly entered the daosource?'How ... How is this possible?'The shadow disappeared in a flash. The Crimson Moon Lord was a little crazy. At this moment, a lot of parts appeared on his Crimson Moon, as if it was missing many things. The next moment, it seemed to have lost all its anger and was somewhat lost!The angry Dao had been torn apart!He didn't seem to know what anger was!The power of his great Dao flowed out crazily. In the blink of an eye, his aura began to decline from a relatively strong level eight to almost dropping down to level eight!Just a little bit more!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  As for the light Master and the cloud Master, their expressions changed slightly.A rogue cultivator!This guy had given up on the great path universe. This also meant that he would not be able to improve in the future. Of course, this also meant that the red moon had no restrictions."Kill him!"The radiant sovereign quickly charged towards him!As for the cloud Master, his eyes flickered, but he did not give chase. Beside him, Deepsea wanted to give chase, but Cloud Master transmitted his voice,""Stop chasing. It's good. The Crimson Moon has collapsed and neo martial arts has grown stronger. Now ... There's only a level eight rogue cultivator left ... To restrain neo martial arts!"He revealed a meaningful smile.However, he soon frowned."Silver Moon King ... In that case, something has happened in the Crimson Moon world. Silver Moon King ... Could it be that neo martial has attacked the Crimson Moon world? will they take away the eighth-tier universe?"If that was the case, it would be troublesome.……BOOM!The red moon crumbled, and the great Dao shook violently.The universe trembled non-stop, and the power of many great DAOs was extracted. Li Hao had stripped away many great DAOs, but the other party hadn't taken all of them. However, at this moment, his Dao source had collapsed, and the entire great Dao universe still showed signs of collapsing."What a pity!" Li Hao said regretfully.An eighth-level great path universe was still very powerful. Unfortunately, at least 40% of the power of the great path had been extracted by the other party. In other words, the entire world could originally accommodate 100 venerable sovereigns, one eighth-level, and many seventh-level.Now that Red Moon master had taken 40% of it, perhaps, even if it was preserved, it could only accommodate dozens of venerable sovereigns at most. The number of seventh-rank venerable sovereigns could only accommodate two or three at most. It would even be difficult to accommodate an eighth-rank venerable sovereign.It was showing signs of falling from level eight. It might be stronger than an Ordinary Level Seven, but it was not as strong and stable as those level eight great Dao universes.He couldn't completely separate it. The other party sensed the change and quickly made a choice.

What a pity!He felt a little regretful.Also, this fellow really didn't die. What was the human King doing? he actually didn't kill the other party and even gave the other party a chance to escape ... Why wasn't the human King as powerful as he had imagined?However, he soon realized that the world that had yet to merge with the Crimson Moon had become much quieter.Li Hao's heart trembled ...... The human King, he wouldn't be The guardian of the forest orchid sector Lord, right?If that was the case, he would have to reevaluate the human King.If that was the case ... This neo martial artist King was more humane than he had imagined. Li Hao felt that it would be good if he failed to kill the red moon Lord in order to protect him!Very quickly, he concluded that this was the case.Otherwise, there was no way to explain why the forest orchid realm was still very stable. It had not been affected by the turbulence of the Crimson Moon universe. This meant that the level 7 realm was still alive!The forest orchid sector Lord didn't die."Human King ... That's good!"Li Hao smiled.For an unfamiliar stranger, even an enemy, he did something because of the enemy, making him feel that he owed him a favor. He chose to give up the opportunity to kill the enemy and protect the other party ... The neo martial King had indeed not changed.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Wasn't the essence of neo martial art protection?To protect the human race!At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat impressed. At this level, not everyone could stick to their original intentions. The neo martial artist King, who looked like a hooligan, actually chose to give up on killing Red Moon at this critical moment.Previously, in order to protect Wu Shan, he had chosen to make a move ... This person was worth befriending."Crimson Moon universe!"Li Hao laughed. The next moment, he released a man, Qian Wuliang."Qian Wuliang, absorb the power of the great Dao!" In an instant, he also released hundreds of little realms. His long sword floated in the air as he laughed,""Draw!" The power of countless great DAOs surged in!I'll beat Red Moon first!At this time, they shouldn't split the spoils of war first, but the great Dao was in great turmoil. If this continued, the great Dao might explode. They had to calm down first.This time, he had gained a lot!……At the same time.In the endless sky World, Wu Shan had finally killed the seventh rank venerable sovereign and exterminated a large number of venerable sovereigns. Some of them had escaped, and he and venerable the sword had wanted to pursue them ... But in the end, both of them had lost control of their powers.They could only give up on the pursuit, as not many people escaped.At that moment, a large number of the nearby worlds were struck to death by the lightning. They did not have any experts to keep watch. The seventh-grade lightning tribulation had killed a large number of venerable sovereigns. Some of the venerable sovereigns who had escaped were blocked at the realm gate by Li Zhu and the others. A massacre broke out, and no one knew how many venerable sovereigns had been killed.The entire area quickly became quiet.Before long, the three worlds were teleported and dragged by the experts toward the Crimson Moon!The Crimson Moon in the distance also quieted down.Obviously, the red moon had been completely taken down!At this moment, all the venerable sovereigns were ecstatic!The four major worlds!This time, he had really struck it rich. Putting everything else aside, just the four great Dao universes and the worlds themselves were great wealth. Moreover, the four great worlds had existed for many years, so it was impossible for them to not have any savings.The four worlds had raised two hundred venerable sovereigns, one level eight, and nearly ten Level Seven. How could they not have any savings?Venerable the sword was dragging tianlan. In the distance, Lizhu was dragging cangjiang, and kongji was dragging Yueming. The three of them were overjoyed. Even Lizhu couldn't keep his calm. This time, they had gained too much!As for monarch Wu Shan, his power had started to dissipate completely and he returned to his powerless state. At this time, he suddenly felt a little scared ... Can I ... Get a share?I'm a lamb waiting to be slaughtered now!

Chapter 3024 Splitting The Loot, Promotion (1)
The four great worlds trembled.Soon, the other powerful beings dragged the world and got close to the Crimson Moon.In the world, countless creatures cried and cried in fear. Blood rained from the sky. The powerful venerable sovereigns were either killed on the spot or fled to the chaos.Those Heavenly Kings and Saints even wished they could hide in the cracks in the ground and let the Devils invade!The devil ... Did he make a mistake?It did not count.How could these living beings make the decisions in a World War? it was the world Lords who started the war. Ordinary living beings only knew that the world they were born in had been invaded. Countless people had been killed, and venerable sovereigns had died tragically!The sword Saint and the others saw this scene, but they were not moved at all.This was the world of cultivation.The law of the jungle!Chaos did not distinguish between right and wrong.If you're not strong, that's how it is.Small worlds were even more miserable. Sometimes, when they were encountered by experts, they might just refine the world for their descendants to use. They could directly destroy the world and turn billions of living beings into dust in an instant.Everyone didn't say anything and didn't care.They had no interest in slaughtering the weak, but they also had no interest in appeasing the civilians of the enemy forces.At this moment, everyone looked at Hong Yue.The red moon shook the world.A universe directly descended between heaven and earth. A few experts took a look and frowned slightly. It seemed to be much weaker. An eighth-tier universe was not so fragile. It seemed that something had happened.However, to be able to directly present the great path universe meant that ... Red Moon master had lost control of the great path universe.This time, everyone was a little excited.It was a good thing!The Crimson Moon universe, an eighth-tier universe, had actually been seized, and it was even better than expected.At this moment, the Crimson Moon universe seemed to split open. Li Hao walked out. His world was still absorbing the power of great DAOs, but Li Hao didn't care about that. He looked at the people outside the world and said,""Venerable sovereigns of the forest orchid world, let's move the forest orchid world out together. The Crimson Moon universe has been broken, and the forest orchid can be free! Sector Lord Sen LAN is still alive...Nothing happened to him, don't worry!"Sovereign Yan Fang looked at Li Hao with a complicated expression.The Crimson Moon ... Was gone!It was really gone.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The great Dao universe had been taken away, and Senlan had yet to completely integrate with it. At this moment, she could be taken out. Furthermore, the master of the great Dao universe was no longer Red Moon master, and no one was restricting her."Many thanks, fellow Daoist myriad Daoist!""You're welcome, it's what I should do!" Li Hao chuckled. Sector Lord Sen LAN, if you want to be free, let's not talk about anything else. You have to first strip Sen LAN of her. Otherwise, you'll absorb too much, even the energy of the Sen LAN great Dao.Very quickly, Yan Fang and the others began to strip the world and the great Dao universe.With no one to suppress or control them, and Li Hao's support, the process of stripping them off wasn't too difficult. After all, they had just fused.Li Hao looked at the three major worlds nearby and said,""Sword Saint divided the endless sky World, which contains the great Dao universe. Sword Saint, can I take it?"Venerable the sword glanced at Li Hao. A great path universe and a complete world. Tianlan's world Lord had died here, and not much energy had been lost. With the power of the world and the power of the great path combined, even if he could not advance to Level Seven, he should be close to it.In fact, it should be enough, because it was exclusive and not shared.A universe of the great path had supported many venerable sovereigns. Now, it should be enough to support him and advance."I have no objections!" He nodded.This time, he had also contributed a lot, but with Wu Shan's participation ... The difficulty was actually not too great, and it was much easier than expected.Otherwise, it would be difficult to kill a rank seven."Senior Li Zhu ..."Li Hao looked at Li Zhu."The nethermoon world is based on the netherworld Dao. You were the king of the catacombs in the past, and you used the underhand technique as your Foundation ... The nethermoon world is more suitable for you. You can divide the nethermoon great Dao universe!"Li Zhu glanced at Li Hao and nodded.The Dao universe did not include the world.A world was a world, and the great Dao universe was a great Dao universe. The two were closely related, but they were not completely one. It was normal that he had not been assigned a complete world. In fact, the great Dao universe was already very good."Senior Wushan!"Li Hao looked at Wu Shan."Senior, you cultivate the heavenly secrets fog. I don't know the specific path. If I give you the cangjiang great Dao universe and the cangjiang world, will you be able to recover to your peak?"p It was only recovery, not advancement."That's right." Wu Shan made a judgment and nodded."It shouldn't be difficult to recover to the peak of the seventh rank. With a universe as the foundation, it's definitely possible ..."But ...While he was still thinking, Li Hao said,"everyone must devour the great Dao universe. Don't control it!"The few of them were stunned.It wasn't that they had to control it, but devouring ... They didn't even have the foundation of a great Dao universe. They were all itinerant cultivators. What was Li Hao trying to do?In fact, if he used the Crimson Moon as the foundation and merged the three great worlds, even if it couldn't become a level-nine universe, it would at least become a relatively powerful universe among level-eight universes.Wu Shan had a high chance of stepping into grade 8.As for Lizhu, venerable sword, and the others, they had all reached Level Seven. It could be said that they could completely establish their own level eight world and fill the gap in the Crimson Moon."The situation is unclear. At this moment, staying in the world will only be a burden! The red moon master isn't dead yet. He just left the universe and became a wandering cultivator ... I don't know if he'll be killed, but he's still alive! The great Dao universe can move, but if the world doesn't move, the foundation of the universe won't move, and the great world can't move ... If we stay, we'll be trapped beasts!"

Chapter 3025 Splitting The Loot, Promotion (2)
Li Hao said,"devour it directly. Skin and bones. Don't leave anything behind!"The effect would be different if he swallowed it all.There was no need to consider anything!He would directly eat it!Everyone's hearts moved, but they didn't say anything. It was good.Li Hao continued,"this time, sector Lord Sen LAN has also paid a huge price!" Many venerable sovereigns have fallen in the forest orchid realm ... I'll leave the power of the Dark Moon world for the forest orchid world to devour and stabilize its advancement to rank-7!""In addition ... The Silver Moon probably won't be able to digest the level 8 Crimson Moon world. After we devour it for a while, the remaining great Dao power will be devoured by the forest orchid world!"On the other side, Yan Fang was stunned. What?Red Moon, give it to us?Not far away, Kong Ji wanted to say something but stopped. What about me?Senlan had been assigned to the nethermoon world and received a large amount of the Crimson Moon's power ... He and Li Hao were the main guides, but they didn't seem to get much.On Li Hao's side, he had received quite a bit of the Crimson Moon's power.While he was thinking, Li Hao said,"I'll directly extract the power of the Crimson Moon world ... Kong Ji, you can extract it. You can try Nirvana or revival. The world power of a level 8 great world is enough for you!""What about you?" Kong Ji couldn't help but ask.So you didn't get anything?It wasn't like they didn't get anything. They only got some power of the Crimson Moon, but Li Hao and the others didn't extract much of the level eight great Dao. Even if Li Hao reached level five, he wouldn't use up all of it.Wouldn't li Hao suffer a great loss this way?Li Hao grinned."These are all for you. As for the rest ... The venerable sovereigns 'and the world's savings, they all belong to me, Silver Moon!" Let's call it opening the blind box, as many as you can open! If you're lucky, you can open tens of billions of Dao crystals, dozens of monarch weapons, and hundreds of worlds ... You have to know that these are four great worlds. If you're lucky, you might be more valuable than the world itself!""Hundreds of venerable sovereigns ... They can't all be poor, can they?"That's right, Silver Moon did not need any of that, so he was going to open the blind box!However much he opened, it counted.Was it a loss?Actually, it wasn't a loss.The world was equivalent to a house or real estate.However, it was impossible for a rich man to only have real estate. He had some liquid assets. Now, Li Hao didn't even want a house in the square world. He was betting on how much liquid assets these people had.After all, it wasn't just one or two years, but millions of years. After so many years, wouldn't he have any liquid assets?This was not easy to calculate.,m On the other hand, the real estate was here, so it was easy to calculate.Li Zhu had contributed a lot, but he hadn't done much to kill a level Seven. Li Hao was not mistreating him by giving him a part of the great Dao universe. The sword venerable contributed more, so it was a complete world.Not only did Senlan get a seventh-level world power, but she also took the remaining eighth-level great Dao universes that Li Hao and the others devoured. It could be said that she did not let monarch Senlan down by getting a seventh-level world and a half.Wushan, a complete Level Seven world, was just for his recovery ... It should be more than enough.Void, the world power of a rank eight world was enough for him to play with.These people didn't think that Li Hao was giving them too little. On the contrary, they were all hesitating. Li Hao was right. They should open as many blind boxes as they could. Perhaps they could make a fortune!But ... But what if he didn't get anything?  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  What if everyone was really poor and only had real estate?This time, Li Hao, who had led the plan, had gained nothing except for some power of the Crimson Moon great Dao!What a huge loss!"I only need a universe. I don't need the power of the world ..." Sword Saint said.Sovereign Wushan was a little embarrassed."Well ... I ... I'm about the same. I don't even need to waste the power of the great Dao universe. Give me the power of the world. I just need to recover, not advance ..."It would be embarrassing to give too much.To be honest, it was not too difficult this time.Killing AI Hong was very simple.In fact, he did not have to pay much of a price to kill another venerable sovereign LAN Yue by joining forces with venerable sword. Moreover, he was already a disabled person, and it was Li Hao who helped him recover.From the looks of it ... He had too many points.As for Supreme Emperor Yan Fang, he also seemed to want to speak. Li Hao looked at Yan Fang and said,""The forest world has just entered Level Seven and is in need of a large amount of world power and great Dao power. You don't have to be polite! Sector Lord Sen LAN, if you don't want to leave Senlan...Then let me be more stable. A Type 7 world, even if he can't fight against a type 8, at least a type 8 wouldn't dare to easily invade!"Paragon Yan Fang's gaze became more and more complicated. The Senlan realmlord wasn't here.At this moment, if Li Hao was a little bit more ruthless, he would not share the loot ... Even if he swallowed Sen LAN, she would not have a fart. She would not be able to resist.Then it wouldn't be just four worlds, but five!Not to mention one less share of the spoils, the key was that they could get more.At that time, Li Hao could split it however he wanted."Many thanks, Silver Moon King!"Sovereign Yan Fang didn't say anything else, bowing deeply,""The realm Lord is not here. Today, I, the venerable sovereigns of Senlan, thank the Silver Moon King for his generosity on behalf of the realm Lord!"Generous?No, it was simply ... He didn't even know how to put it.He had gained a seventh-level world power and more than half of the eighth-level great path universe. This time, he had really made a huge profit. The venerable sovereigns of Senlan felt like they were in a dream.In this way, once the harvest was digested, Senlan, who had just advanced to Level Seven, would only have one level Seven venerable sovereign after the digestion. Whether it was the world or the great Dao, they would not be much worse than those top level Seven universes.

Chapter 3026 Splitting The Loot, Promotion (3)
If it developed freely, Senlan might need 100000 years, 200000 years ... Or even longer to develop."There's no time to waste!"Li Hao said,"everyone, quickly digest all the gains!" If you can advance, then do so. If you can 't, then do your best to stabilize and strengthen yourself ... Martial uncle Hong, Black Panther, you guys quickly go and search the four worlds! All the treasures, take them all!""The civilian cultivators of the four worlds ..." Hong Yitang said in a deep voice."Ignore them!"Li Hao said, that's not right ... How about this? move all the cultivators from the other three worlds to the Crimson Moon! Move the civilians of the Crimson Moon to the three worlds!""Drain their energy and let them die on their own! However, it went from a powerful world to a martial-destroying world ... Cultivators were gradually cut off. If there's a chance, a cultivation path can naturally be born. If there's no chance ... They'll completely disappear in the chaos!"For Li Hao, not killing them was the greatest gift he could give.However, once the situation became chaotic, the cultivators 'destructive power would be too great ... In that case, the cultivators should all play together. As for the ordinary people, they would be separated into three worlds and waste some time. It could be considered Li Hao's favor.He thought of something and suddenly looked at Yan Fang,""Senlan has advanced. There aren't many people. If Senlan is interested, you can choose a few people to enter!"Li Hao thought for a moment and added,"don't choose only cultivators ... Population is also very important for a stable world. You can choose a portion of ordinary people at your discretion. Be quick!"Yan Fang's eyes lit up when he heard this!Yes, for non-individual cultivators, and for the macro worlds with both the universe of the great path and the world of the great path, population was very important. They all walked the path of cultivation for all the people.As for the cultivators in the square world, they were knowledgeable, had a large population, were of high quality, and had a strong foundation ... It would be very beneficial to enrich Senlan now.Li Hao said,"try not to choose too strong ones. You can choose some infants ... Bring your entire family. Young people have more potential. The cultivators now probably hate you a lot. Since sector Lord Sen LAN isn't here, I'll just say a few words!""In addition, don't bring too many people. It's best to choose some of the four worlds ..."Yan Fang hurriedly nodded.Li Hao saw that he was about to get to work excitedly. Li Hao hesitated for a moment, but still sent a voice transmission: "You can choose a group of powerful Crimson Moon cultivators and Crimson Moon residents who are hostile to you ... And create an opposing force within Senlan. This way, there will be no lack of training grounds within Senlan, and there will be no need for chaos to appear! Senlan has just advanced to tier 7, and the People's hearts are unstable. With external and internal problems, it will be beneficial for unification!"Yan Fang's heart moved slightly, and he immediately nodded.This Silver Moon King was said to be quite young, but he didn't expect him to know so much about this.He was right. As long as everything was under control, it would be beneficial for Senlan to be United if there was one more hostile force within the organization.……"The rest of you, go and search!"Li Hao shouted,"clean up the battlefield quickly. There's quite a commotion here. You should know that these few great worlds are not the only ones in the red moon zone. The rest of the great worlds may be far away, but it doesn't mean they won't come. Hurry up!""Uncle Li, you guys should recover and level up ... Quickly complete the energy extraction! Don't leave any behind!" Upon hearing this, venerable the sword did not say anything else and quickly entered the endless sky World."You guys probably won't advance that quickly," Li Hao said."During the absorption process, I might enter other universes and help you guys tear down some houses ... Just leave me an opening!"'It's the square world! How cool would it be to tear down a big world!'His comprehension of the great Dao had improved greatly. Of course, he wouldn't miss it. At this moment, he wished he could create a clone!Furthermore, Silver moon's harvest this time would all depend on the blind box.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  At this moment, Kong Ji also flew over. He felt a little regretful and transmitted a message,""Haoyue, I actually also want a universe of the great Dao...I don't want the world Energy ..."He was just telling the truth.After being assigned to the Crimson Moon world, it was actually not weak. It was a level eight great world!But ... He wanted the great Dao universe.But now, they had all been distributed, and Li Hao himself had not been given any. He felt that he shouldn't have suddenly said this, but he still felt a little regretful.The universe of the great path was more precious than a world.However, an eighth-level great world might not be worse than a seventh-level great Dao universe.Li Hao sent a voice transmission, are you stupid?What did that mean?"The world is the source of energy for the perfect domain! The power of a great Dao ... What's the use of the power of a great Dao if you're not at Level Seven? "Perfect your realm and domain first. Build the foundation first. What's there to be afraid of if you lack the power of your great DAOs? when you really advance, you'll naturally have them! This time, you won't be able to reach the seventh rank!""Nonsense, I was just one step away!"Kong Ji felt that Li Hao had underestimated him!Li Hao smiled and said telepathically, that's enough. It's fine if you're satisfied with an Ordinary Level 7 ... But you're void, six paths, three extremes. To be honest, the quality of these worlds isn't high! The same goes for Red Moon. It's fine if it's a one-time consumable, but you really want it to be the foundation for advancement?""But ...""Think about daoqi, think about tianfang world not having an owner yet!"“……” As soon as he said this, Kong Ji's heart moved.The next moment, he smiled and nodded.""Alright, I understand! Then I'll go and extract the power of the world to perfect my six Dao domain. If it's perfect, I might even be at the peak of the type 6 realm!"

3027 Chapter 496
After hearing Li Hao's words, he felt that it wasn't bad.It wasn't that he didn't have any ideas, but he had been envious of the great Dao universe before ... But Li Hao had said that the tianfang great Dao universe didn't have an owner yet!Li Hao didn't waste any more time and continued to absorb the power of the Crimson Moon great Dao.Qian Wuliang was also absorbing it!King Huai was also absorbing it!This time, everyone had gained quite a lot. At the moment, Li Hao's group seemed to have gained the least, but Li Hao felt that no matter how little it was, it would not be too little. With so many venerable sovereigns, if each of them stored some treasures, it would be enough for Silver Moon to eat his fill!There were too many of them, so he couldn't use them. In fact, they weren't very useful.At present, this distribution could maximize the benefits. Everyone could use it and digest it.On this day, one expert after another quickly absorbed the spoils of war.This was because the Masters of the four great Dao universes were either dead or Red Moon master had run away. They were all ownerless worlds, so they were easy to control.The aura of the entire realm became stronger and stronger.Wushan's recovery could be said to be the fastest.All he needed to do was recover and absorb enough power of great DAOs. Normally, where could he absorb the power of a peak level Seven great Dao? but at this moment, a universe and a world were enough.Although he couldn't enter the eighth step ... From now on, he would be completely free from the clouds and no longer be restricted. To Wu Shan ... It was worth it.He did not lack anything from Yunxiao now.The energy had been returned, and only Yunxiao owed him.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  ……At this moment, Li Hao was absorbing the power of great DAOs to fill his world.The power of the Crimson Moon was difficult to digest. It was the power of desire. Although the power of great DAOs had many attributes, Li Hao knew that if he absorbed too much, it would interfere with him sooner or later.However, he was not afraid!He even dared to absorb time energy, let alone desire energy. Qian Wuliang, on the other hand, absorbed a lot and felt that he was about to advance. Li Hao was a little worried that he would lose control if he absorbed too much.If Qian Wuliang reached Level 4, it would be a huge breakthrough. As for Hong Yitang, although he couldn't reach Level 4 yet, he should be able to do so soon as long as he had enough Dao crystals.If they broke through, the venerable sovereigns who had joined the Silvermoon world would have a chance to break through as well.……At this moment, the entire Crimson Moon region was unusually quiet. Only the world was still in chaos.Lin Hongyu and the others were plundering everywhere. There were too many treasures in the great world.The venerable sovereigns had scattered to various worlds to search for treasures. With the Black Panther around, it was hard to hide any treasures from it.In the end, second cat suddenly appeared. While Li Hao was absorbing, he ran out and said,""Then I'll go and take a look too ...""Senior second cat ... You ... You're not going to absorb the world's origin, are you?""I can 't? This is the square major world ..." Li Hao hesitated for a moment, then quickly said,""You can, but don't absorb all of it. Leave a little ... It's not even as good as a small world. It's enough to maintain life. This way, it can prevent people from coveting it and turning the four worlds into mortals!"That's pretty good!What he was afraid of was that if ermao absorbed it all, the four worlds would be completely destroyed. Li Hao didn't really care about the destruction of the four worlds, but the population of the four worlds was too large.Hundreds of billions, trillions!With so many living beings, if the source of the world was completely extinguished, they would not be able to grow any food!Second cat rolled its eyes."I don't have such thoughts. There are too many living creatures. If I absorb all of them, they'll all die. It's a sin."Do I need you to remind me?Second cat didn't care anymore and quickly disappeared. At this moment, he was also smiling happily.He only needed to leave a little of the four great worlds 'source of life. It would not be good to leave too much. If there was too much, the source of the world might be coveted by others. He would leave a little to maintain the survival of the creatures in the four great worlds.Any normal venerable sovereign would not destroy the four worlds for such a small amount of world origin. That would be too great of a sin, and there was a cycle of karma.If he encountered a madman who insisted on absorbing it ... Even if he didn't leave it behind, the other party would still shatter the world. There was no other way.……Li Hao was still absorbing energy to fill his little world.At this moment, Lin Hongyu and the others had finished cleaning up the battlefield. They did not go to Li Hao directly. Instead, they gathered together and talked to each other.Very quickly, they all revealed a look of joy.Obviously, the harvest was not bad.Soon, Lin Hongyu entered the Crimson Moon universe along the river that Li Hao had opened up with her harvest.……"How much?"Li Hao knew that the battlefield had been cleaned up when he saw her.In fact, Li Hao was also a little nervous.Too little ... That would be a huge loss.p This time, other than himself, Silver Moon would have to obtain at least a few billion great Dao crystals before he would be satisfied, right?Lin Hongyu was all smiles. She did not keep him in suspense and quickly said,""The great Dao crystals are the most common. Most venerable sovereigns have some. This time, there are many venerable sovereigns, and they are all venerable sovereigns of the macro worlds, so they are not poor ... After we cleaned up the battlefield, the power of the great Dao turned into great Dao crystals after some of the venerable sovereigns died. There are also some Dao accumulation crystals ... But only two level-seven ones have produced Dao accumulation crystals.""There aren't many Dao crystals, only about 10 million.""And there are many great Dao crystals!""That's right!" She smiled radiantly."With the stock from the four great worlds, we have a total of six billion great Dao crystals!"

Was it a lot?Actually, it wasn't a lot.However, they were much more poor than they had expected.Li Hao also smiled!Very good!6 billion ... It was more than what he had expected.However, that was not all. Lin Hongyu continued,""In addition, we've found a total of 37 small worlds and 9 medium-level worlds ..."  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  In the past, Senlan had even taken out a medium-level world.Obviously, these great worlds also had them. Nine ... It wasn't too many, but it wasn't too few either.Li Hao nodded again!This was the value of more than one billion great Dao crystals. In fact, it would be difficult to purchase so many worlds in large quantities with more than one billion great Dao crystals.In total, that was 46 worlds!Li Hao smiled.Lin Hongyu was not done yet. She said excitedly,"There are also other treasures and nine monarch weapons ... However, eight of them are low-grade monarch weapons, and only one is a mid-grade one!"It was a pity that there were only nine monarch weapons among so many venerable sovereigns.Moreover, almost all of them were at the initial stage."I've said it all in one breath, is there anything else?""There are!""In the red moon, we found thousands of huge energy mines ..." Lin Hongyu became even more excited.Li Hao was stunned and looked at her.At the level of venerable sovereigns ... What's the use of these?"Send Silver Moon back!""If that's the case, the Silver Moon will no longer be a poor, middle-level world. It will become an energy-rich land that is no weaker than a great world!" Lin Hongyu said excitedly.Li Hao laughed and nodded.In truth, these thousands of ore veins might not be worth much, but ... That's right, I'll just keep them. If I send them back to Silver Moon, Silver Moon can indeed become a Holy Land for cultivation.However ... He actually wanted to say that this was also a type of world force.These were given to Kong Ji.You guys dig this up, do you know about the void?"Is that all?"Lin Hongyu shook her head and smiled."There's another treasure. I think ... You might be able to use it.""What?""This one!"Lin Hongyu took out an item. Li Hao looked at it and was a little confused. After a while, he said,""This is ..." "A map!"Lin Hongyu was overjoyed,"a complete map of the entire four-sided domain!" It marked the locations of all the worlds, including the number of top experts, their names, the great Dao they were good at ... What was found in the red moon Temple seemed to have been created by the experts of the red moon! It's much more perfect than the one you had before!""Also ... I've taken a look. It seems to have some simple news about the border areas and other regions outside the square region ..." He said.Li Hao nodded. So that was the case.It was a good thing!The Crimson Moon had existed for many years. Previously, Kong Ji had given him a copy, but it was impossible for the divine light plane to give him the most complete one. Even if Kong Ji wanted to obtain it, it might not be complete.Red Moon had provided him with a complete map.At this moment, Lin Hongyu said excitedly,""Li Hao, can our Silver Moon advance to the great world realm?"We have a Dao universe and a large number of Dao crystals. Can the world ... Let us advance?However, Li Hao shook his head and said,"two path Masters, you've improved too fast. Qian Wuliang is almost at the fourth level!" They could not enter the great world before they reached tier 7 ... Silver Moon was not in a hurry, so he would take it one step at a time! They've already reached the fourth step and then the sixth step, and it's all considered smooth sailing. The only hurdle left is the seventh step, and it might not be able to stop them for long. "There was no hurry.Silver Moon was developing very quickly.He calculated and smiled. He had gained a lot this time. It would be enough if he could absorb enough energy to enter level five in the Crimson Moon great Dao universe. The rest could be saved. It would be enough to make progress in the Silvermoon great Dao universe and also allow the other venerable sovereigns to improve.He would split the world again, absorb the power of the world, and perfect his own world Dao. Although it was difficult to reach level six, it was not too difficult.……The void trembled.In the following days, Li Hao would sometimes leave the Crimson Moon great Dao universe and head to other universes to study the Dao network.The others were also improving rapidly.The energy of the entire cangjiang world was almost depleted, and there was only a small amount of world origin left. However, venerable sovereign Wushan had fully recovered his peak combat strength. Although he had not entered the eighth rank, he was much happier than before.These few days, he had been so happy that those who didn't know would think that he had stepped into level eight.As for the forest orchid world, it had also been split up. As it had devoured the power of the Dark Moon world, the entire world had completely transformed into a level 7 world. The world had expanded a lot.As Senlan absorbed the power of the Crimson Moon great Dao ... The entire Senlan universe continued to grow stronger.……In the tianfang great Dao universe.The battle was still ongoing. Some were chasing after Red Moon Lord, while others were searching for the Dao origin. As for sector Lord Sen LAN, the injuries he had received from the Tribulation were rapidly recovering at a shocking speed!The human King was here, protecting the other party for three whole days.At this moment, it was a little strange. Not only did the opponent's strength not weaken, but the power of the Crimson Moon on his body was also dissipating. Instead, it exploded with the power of all encompassing, and it continued to increase.However, at this moment, it was rapidly climbing towards the middle stage of the seventh rank. The speed was shocking.After a long time, sector Lord Sen Lan's aura changed.He opened his eyes and sighed. He looked at the human King and said,""Thank you for protecting me, human King!""The Silver Moon King ... Is amazing!"

The human King's eyes flickered and his eyebrows twitched."What do you mean?""The shenlan universe...Seems to have absorbed the energy of the Crimson Moon universe, a lot! The power of the world is also growing crazily ...""I, Senlan, might have ... Absorbed the Crimson Moon!" He said with mixed feelings.The entire Crimson Moon?He didn't know, but he knew that even if it wasn 't, it was almost the same.He didn't go out, and he didn't discuss it with Li Hao. He just made a choice and exploded ... Sen LAN might become the biggest winner there!He had just reached Level Seven, and his world was not stable.But now, he could feel that Sen LAN was extremely stable. The great Dao was stable, and the world was stable!As for himself, he had smoothly entered the mid-stage of the seventh rank. For a seventh rank venerable sovereign, it would take tens of thousands of years to accumulate so much energy.On his side, it only took the blink of an eye."You're really willing!"The human King was also speechless. He laughed again,""Not bad, you have some of my style!"Was it?Forest orchid master smiled and did not say anything. For the past three days, the neo martial human King had been his Dao protector ... It had to be said that forest orchid master suddenly felt that the chaos thearchs were actually completely different.The human King could give up hunting down the great enemy Red Moon master for his own impulsive action!The Silver Moon King had given his greatest spoils of war to a group of people he didn't even need to care about, just for the sake of him who wasn't on the battlefield ...It turned out that not everyone would be blinded by benefits."The Crimson Moon ..."Forest orchid master looked at the human King, who sneered.""He's run away. He's hiding everywhere. He deprived himself of the path of the Crimson Moon, and now he's a loose cultivator. Hehe ... He can still run away like that. It's not that he's lucky, but that those two don't care. They think that if this guy stays, he'll restrict new martial arts, and also you, Sen LAN!"The red moon master must die!However, he had survived in the midst of certain death. He knew very well why he had survived!Whether it was cloudsky or Guangming, they didn't use their full strength, nor did they give it their all. On the one hand, they were worried that the other party would do something desperate, and on the other hand ... It was naturally to restrict neo martial!A level eight itinerant cultivator without any ties was actually very difficult to deal with!"He didn't die ..."Sector Lord Sen LAN frowned slightly and sighed,""I'm sorry. "If it wasn't for him, the human King was very strong and had a chance of killing that great enemy."What's there to be afraid of?"The human King had a playful look on his face,'it's pretty good! It was more fun if he didn't die! "A jinx like the red moon Lord, since he's not dead, he'll definitely be unwilling to turn from a hegemon to an itinerant cultivator wandering the chaos ... Sooner or later, he'll gather a group of people. I'm afraid that if he's dead, I won't be able to do anything to him. If he's not dead, I'd like to see who dares to collude with him ... Whoever colludes with him will die! Otherwise, I don't know who I'll deal with next, light, cloud, chiyang, and Longyu. Now ... Let's see!"Forest orchid master's heart moved.He looked at the other party and did not say anything.At this moment, they only felt that these people ... Were really confident and arrogant. Obviously, the human King was not afraid and felt that it was good to run away."I wonder if old Li can advance this time ..." The human King suddenly said.It was only at this moment that this extremely powerful human King seemed to be a little nervous. There was an uneasiness that he had never shown before.……And at this moment.The Crimson Moon region.A wave of sword intent spread across the entire world.An extremely powerful sword intent burst forth, and the sword domain swept through the world, expanding limitlessly!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The domain seemed to have become a world.Or rather, it had turned into a world of the great path and was expanding wildly. It had even created a Dao net.At this moment, Li Hao and the others were all watching.All of them had grave expressions.The sword Saint was about to advance to the next level. He had devoured an entire world. At this moment, he was about to make a complete breakthrough to the seventh level. He was already one step away. This time, at the cost of an entire world, he had finally made this breakthrough!His sword domain seemed to have transformed into a great Dao universe.Ten thousand swords criss-crossed!In the sword realm, Sword Saint was not nervous at all. Instead, he was very confident. At this moment, he soared into the sky and laughed, sighing,""I didn't expect that the opportunity would land in your hands ..."He was talking about Li Hao. Before this, he had never thought that one person could break into a level 7 world.Even if they broke through, they might not be able to completely take it away.However, after following Li Hao for some time, he had achieved his goal. It should be known that even a neo martial artist might seem to break into a rank-7 world quickly, but in fact, it had been planned for a long time.Moreover, many people wanted it, even if revered sword and the human King were close ... It was because of this that they could not snatch it.There were too many people who needed neo martial.Here, he didn't need to care about such things.He had his own world!BOOM!A Grand sword essence pierced through the chaos of heaven and earth!But at this moment, the Dao net was clearly visible in Li Hao's eyes. The real Dao net of longevity sword was completely unobstructed. He could clearly see how it was formed and created!It wasn't because he was so strong that he could see through it so easily. It was because venerable sword ... Had constructed a Dao net for him!Venerable the sword chuckled and allowed Li Hao to probe.Dao can not be passed on easily. However, he had to return the favor. Since Li Hao had given him a universe, and he could advance, and Li Hao also cultivated sword Dao, he would show him his own Dao!What did it matter?Li Hao's eyes flickered. The Dao net of venerable the sword was not weak.It was constructed with more than 4000 great Dao patterns, which was not as good as the master of tianfang, but ... The sword venerable had just entered Level Seven and was still perfecting it!
