At this moment, everyone was a little restrained because the tier 9 was still there.If there weren't any ninth-rank existences, you see, they would've already started killing each other. There wouldn't be so much nonsense.But now, if everyone were to fight to the death ... Once a level 9 expert arrived, wouldn't they all be caught in one fell swoop?At this moment, Li Hao laughed."In fact, I knew from the beginning that it would be difficult to negotiate. It would be difficult to reach an agreement!" "Everyone is a domineering master, but I'm not. But even if I'm not domineering ... I can't keep retreating, right? I gave you the heavenly policy of order, but you didn't want it. You wouldn't be willing to accept six level 8s and the chaos heaven realm even if it were my master ... You want to deal with me, but you're worried about level 9s interfering. You want to kill me, but you're afraid of time shattering ..."He laughed and looked at the others.""Actually, there were many people who could kill me before this. Tian Fang's clone, tribulation's clone, long Zhan, Chun Qiu, huntian, all of them can ...""However, all of them were just saying it. They didn't really make up their minds to pay the price to kill me ... Other than senior human King, everyone was actually afraid and had some ... Higher goals. Including long Zhan, even if everyone really agrees to you, you might not be willing ... Just giving yourself a way out. "Long Zhan frowned slightly."What you guys are afraid of is not me, but Shi Guang, who is at the 9th rank!" Li Hao added."I have to thank Zhan for giving me so many chances, the chance to survive!""The time that Zhan left me played a huge role in me being able to reach where I am today!"Li Hao said it very sincerely, because it was the truth.Fighting has given me many opportunities.A chance to save his life!The weak can't deal with Shi Guang, and that's why they can't kill me."Experts need time, and they're worried that no one can control it. So, even if they can kill me, they're hesitating. Be it the Tribulation's clone or Tian Fang's clone, their main target is not me. They don't want to kill me. They just want to suppress me and subdue me ... Even huntian.Long Zhan had gone easy on him again and again. In the four-sided region, he did not go all out to deal with him either. Why?It was also for this reason!Flowing time!Everyone only listened and did not refute.Li Hao continued."Because of time's existence, I've received too much tolerance and preferential treatment. If time is no longer around, or if there's someone else in charge, I think ... Everyone will probably get rid of me, a troublemaker, as soon as possible."Li Hao laughed and said,"huntian, don't you think so?" If not for Shi Guang, you would have probably killed me with a single punch by now! Why would you be telling me so much? You've arranged for me to be the second brother, and you've been negotiating with me over and over again. Fellow Daoist Spring Autumn, you're also afraid that I'll surrender to you, afraid that something will happen to me, and you're also thinking of ways to save me ..."The human King laughed."You're quite smart. I thought you really thought that everyone liked you!"Li Hao laughed,"how could that be?" I'm not loved by everyone. I've killed a lot of people and offended a lot of people. Long Zhan's wife, I've killed her, but he's very polite to me ... Don't tell me, he still wants to marry me home to be his wife?Long Zhan's expression was somewhat ugly.Feng Yan's face was filled with anger, and the black Tiger's killing intent was strong.Li Hao, hateful!"In this era, other than neo martial, I don't have too much enmity with anyone ... At least a little. Senior human King, I've stolen the limelight several times. If I were an enemy, I would've been slapped to death a long time ago ..."The human King laughed."You're not wrong. However, you're my junior. I'll forgive you!"The two of them echoed each other.At this moment, the human King laughed."I think you're a little tired of living. Why don't we do this? open up a sky and give up on time. At the same time, cut off the chaos great Dao for a while and interfere with the descent of a tier 9. Without time on you, you'll be completely free! Whoever you want to kill, whoever wants to kill you, you won't hold back at all! Without Shi Guang, who the hell are you? if you want to die, no one will stop you! Am I right?""Senior human King ... You really know my mind ..." Li Hao smiled brilliantly."Go to hell!"The human King laughed and scolded,"you little brat. If you don't know how to make metaphors, then shut up. Why do you have to open your mouth?" Do you think I don't understand your little thoughts? Now that everyone was here and the sky had been opened, everyone would take revenge! Of course, what everyone was worried about now was that you've opened the sky, become stronger, and headed straight for tier 9 ... Would you really give up? I do believe you, but they don 't!"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ He laughed and said,"really, I believe you!" I think that even though Shi Guang has helped you a little, she has also shackled you down a lot. You're such a hypocrite. Even if everyone doesn't kill you, you're too embarrassed to kill them ... Simply put, you're so pretentious ... You'll only feel good after torturing yourself!" He laughed out loud."I know people like you too well. You're hypocritical to the bone, but you also think that this is justice ... Well, it's actually not wrong. Justice is hypocritical!"He looked around and laughed heartily."We're different from Li Hao. We're not playing any games. Li Hao wants to split open the sky, give up the Dao River, merge time into it, and choose the third generation of time controllers ... Do you believe me?" If he believes it, then we'll fulfill his wish. If he doesn't ... We'll have a good time today!"Li Hao sighed."I was born by my parents. I was born by the human King. The human King ... If anyone says anything bad about you, I'll cut them down." The human King laughed out loud, and as he laughed ... He cursed."Do I still need you to help me kill people? Do you really think you're stronger than me?"The human King snorted. 'This kid is taking advantage of me!'At this moment, huntian's people seemed to realize what Li Hao's goal was. Huntian's expression changed.Li Hao ... Was going to split open the sky!So that was how it was!He was thinking, here ...His expression turned ugly. This is the West, my territory. He's going to split the heavens and earth here!Bastard!Spring Autumn and the others 'expressions also changed. Spring autumn's eyes flickered as he looked at Li Hao and cursed in his heart. Why didn't you leave? you're such a bad person!So it was your idea for me to call for help?How cheap!At this moment, his aura began to fluctuate.His aura spread out in all directions.Huntian looked at Li Hao coldly. You can split open the sky, but you can't do it in the West.Second ... He didn't believe that Li Hao would give up on the river of the path.In other words, Li Hao should be even more powerful after splitting open the sky!At that time, it would become a huge threat to the chaos.No one knew what the benefits of splitting open the sky were, but at the very least, the increase in one's comprehension of the great Dao meant that Li Hao might be able to instantly split open 6000 or even 7000 realms ... At that time, would Li Hao still be able to take them down?……At this moment.Deep in the chaos.The master of Tian Fang suddenly opened his eyes."The chaos has failed. Li Hao might be splitting open the sky. The West is a good place. Whether the third generation of time cultivators will appear or not depends on Li Hao's continued control ... Perhaps it will be today! Everyone, do you want to wait, or ... Do you want to interfere again and let us control it?"The statues opened their eyes one after another.Today?How could this be!However, from what Tian Fang said, it was clear that he had seen and sensed something that no one else had.For a time, the depths of the chaos also began to shake.To stop or not to stop?

Chapter 3701 Devil Sword Li Hao (1)
Outside the chaos heaven realm.Experts stood in great numbers, and there were dozens of grade 8 auras.Split open the sky?This place?At this moment?Huntian Supreme Emperor's face was dark.Whether Li Hao would really give up after splitting open the sky like the human King had said ... It was highly unlikely. Even ordinary people wouldn 't.The location was West.What a joke!The West was the base of his huntian chaos. He had been here for many years and had built a powerful huntian system. If Li Hao wanted to split open the sky here ... Stop fooling around.How was that possible?At this moment, the smile on huntian's face was gone. He regained his calm and cold expression."Li Hao, you're not joking, are you?"His voice was cold and shook the world,"today, I've resolved the chaos. I don't want to create any more chaos! Your master is here with me, and I have no intention of killing him. Hand over the others, withdraw from the West, and leave behind the heavenly policy of order ... As for the power of faith, I will deal with it myself!"At this moment, he chose to take a step back.Although the power of faith was hard to deal with, it could still be slowly worn down.It would be fine as long as the source was cut off.Li Hao smiled and looked at him. He didn't say anything, and then looked at his teacher.Yuan Shuo was also looking at Li Hao, as if he had seen through something. He smiled, shrugged, and said in a soft voice,""Little Hao ... I've been sucking up to my disciple for many years, but you're too cruel! How can you trick your teacher like this ... I'm still alive, aren't I?"Li Hao showed a faint smile,"teacher, I've reached my limit!" I've always been like this. I'm a man of the pugilistic world, and I know that there are Tigers on the mountain, but I'm still inclined to go to the Tiger Mountain!"He laughed."You don't like it, but you have to maintain that hypocritical justice. Just like what the human King said, hypocritical to the point that ... You're hypocritical to the bone!""I'm hesitating today, but I don't have the intention to break the cauldrons and sink the boats. Master ... If I fail, I'll sink into oblivion. If I succeed ... I'll bring you back. What do you think?"Huntian's expression changed.What for?Yuan Shuo laughed,"will it work?" I, your master, have always trusted you, but you ... Are sometimes not very reliable. ""I don't know. Teacher, do you ... Believe in the secret skill of five birds?""Of course," Yuan Shuo laughed.He seemed to have completely understood.My disciple ...At this moment, he suddenly understood why he had to absorb the power of the five elements. It was because he was worried that the power of the five elements would not be enough and that it would not be able to pass through the barrier. Other people kill their enemies as a sacrifice, but you, this Rascal, want to kill your teacher as a sacrifice!It was either success or death!If you succeed, you'll bring me back. If you fail ... Are you going to die together with me?You're really ruthless and willing to part with me. Do you think that I'm the only one in the chaos that's worth taking with you?It seemed ... Not bad.As expected, you're still the closest to me.Yuan Shuo laughed. He laughed uncontrollably and crazily. At this moment, the corners of his mouth rose."The proudest, proudest, and most worthy thing in my life is that I took you as my disciple, Li Hao!" He looked at huntian beside him and laughed. He laughed arrogantly."Huntian, you don't understand my disciple, and you don't understand ... I'm a Martial Master of the pugilistic world!"Huntian suddenly seemed to understand something.His expression changed.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The human King also took a deep breath, and a low curse resounded around him.Playing this big?'Young people are so fierce. I won't do such things.'Spring Autumn and long Zhan did not seem to understand.The others were even more confused.At this moment, huntian suddenly made his move and charged straight at Yuan Shuo. He was not trying to kill him ... But to ... Save him!Yes, save him.At this moment, Yuan Shuo laughed. A beast appeared above his head. The five birds merged and surrounded him from all directions. The five elements surrounded him and a domain appeared instantly, blocking everything.Beside him, the flying Tiger was still a little confused.Yuan Shuo looked down at the flying Tiger and laughed. His voice was so low that it could not be heard."Little tiger, I'm sorry!"If there's a chance, we ... Will meet again!The five elements burned and the chaotic force exploded. The power of the five elements shook the heavens and earth. Yuan Shuo instantly exploded with an incomparably powerful aura. At this moment, he did not attack anyone else. He clenched his fists and stepped into the air, his peak fighting spirit erupting."Five birds, devil howl!""Roar!"A long howl erupted in an instant. It was like a ferocious beast emerging from the mountain, like a demon descending. It was sharp and ear-piercing, and the cultivators present were all dazzled.In the void, a five elements ring of light appeared between heaven and earth.Yuan Shuo was like a demon, shuttling through the void, his momentum and spirit as one. He clenched his fist and hammered down heavily. As he punched out, the chaos exploded and Yuan Shuo roared,""Yuan Shuo of the five birds, please enlighten me!"Martial masters of the underworld died in the underworld.[My disciple wants me to fight. Then I ... Will fight!]In the distance.Li Hao's face was as calm as death. He didn't attack, stop, or speak.Teacher ... I said, there's no way out.The only way was to split open the sky!Open my path.I've gathered my spirit here today, and I can't delay any longer."If the sky is opened, I will bring you back as the master of the sky. If I fail ... You and I ... Will no longer have the inheritance of the five birds sect.There wasn't much reluctance, just a little ... Sadness.Old demon five birds, can you injure him with this attack?Could he?You've just entered the eighth step, can you injure a top-tier cultivator who is infinitely close to the ninth step?BOOM!The sky collapsed and the earth cracked. The five birds roared and a giant beast appeared. It merged into one and the domain became one. Sword Qi appeared. The five bird Azure sword was filled with sword intent.

Chapter 3702 Demonic Sword Li Hao (2)
Yuan Shuo was like a mad demon as he punched out. In the world, there was only this all-out Fist of Five birds that burned everything.The others were at a loss.He was helpless!Why?Only the human King was calm. He looked at Li Hao expressionlessly, and no one knew what he was thinking.Li Hao, what a man!'You know that you can't defeat huntian, but you still want to split open the sky today ... Your master is really bold!'The Paragon seemed to understand what was going on, and he frowned, his heart pounding.p Using the blood of his teacher to cut off all cauldrons and sink boats!Opening the sky, Yuan Shuo fused the chaos and gathered the five elements again.If he did not split open the sky, he would vanish into thin air and have no more chances. The only way was to break through the origin of chaos.Break the cauldrons and sink the boats, fight with their backs to the water!This Li Hao ... He was usually quiet, but at critical moments, he was ruthless and crazy.Huntian could naturally tell as well. At that moment, his eyes turned cold and his face turned ugly as he shouted in a low voice,""Your master and disciple ... Are they really looking for death!"With a single palm strike, the heavens and earth split apart, and the five birds shattered.He had originally wanted to hold back 30% of his strength and leave Yuan Shuo alive. He had wanted to do it in one go, then weaken and then exhaust himself!As long as he could break the momentum of the master and disciple, Li Hao would have no choice but to retreat.However, at this moment, Yuan Shuo let out a shrill cry. The Dao merged, and the great Dao of chaos emerged. The five elements surrounded him, and the spirits of heaven and earth appeared. The spirits of the great Dao and the spirits of the five birds instantly deprived the four directions and five elements of heaven and earth!At this moment, the great Dao of the five elements in the world seemed to have a new master.Jubilant and crazy!Off to the side, the remaining four five elements emissaries 'faces went deathly pale as their five elements power was suddenly sucked away, as if the spirit of a great Dao were snatching it away.Yuan Shuo laughed out loud. He was extremely arrogant and insufferably arrogant.The power of the five elements between heaven and earth seemed to have been extracted by him in an instant. Even a statue in the depths of the chaos was shocked and instantly looked towards the chaos.The power of the five elements began to gather, and their spirituality exploded.It was as if a level 9 had descended!……Chaos, who had entered the void to hide his tracks, suddenly turned around.He was shocked!The five-element Dao master had descended?You won't take revenge on me and want to kill me, right?In the next moment, he sensed it and frowned slightly. It didn't seem ... It didn't seem like it. It didn't seem like the five elements path master. This ... Could there be someone else besides him who had reached level nine?He even proved the Dao of the five elements?It was wrong!In the next moment, the veteran tier 9 cultivator seemed to have sensed something. The five elements around him were being madly extracted and gathered to the West. He sensed carefully and suddenly frowned."New spirit ..."A new person had created a new spirit, a spirit of the five elements.However ... Just like Li Hao that day, he used his spirit ... To burn!Is he crazy? This person had actually comprehended spirituality. At this moment, he was burning his spirit.Otherwise, if it was a million years ago, there would definitely be hope for the strength of the ninth step."It's a pity,"Chaos shook his head and sighed.He had originally wanted to find a place to hide, but at this moment, he suddenly thought of something and changed directions. Taking the risk, he flew towards the West again. Who was using and burning their spirituality to unleash their strongest attack?Unfortunately, I may not be able to see it.Was it to deal with huntian?……In the West.Huntian's expression changed slightly, and he roared,""What a good Yuan Shuo, what a pity ..."Unfortunately, your peak only has the power of one strike!Unfortunately, this was not a million years ago.It's a pity that you've only just entered level eight and have gathered the five elements of the world. You ... Are not qualified.The order was established. With a palm strike, the great Dao seemed to be rebuilt and the five elements seemed to be isolated. At this moment, the four remaining five elements emissaries fell to the ground, twitching as if everything had been sucked out of them.Beside him, the flying Tiger was still in a daze ... But at this moment, a suffocating aura spread out, causing it to wail in sorrow as its body began to collapse.I think I'm finished!What's going on?'I haven't even figured it out yet ... And we've already started fighting.'Moreover, the others didn't make a move, except for ... Yuan Shuo, the weakling who was said to be Li Hao's master ... Fine, he was also a level 8 existence, but he was only a weak level 8 existence. Why was he so powerful at this moment?What had happened?It didn't understand.Its flesh and blood were collapsing and turning into dust. The flying Tiger let out a sad cry. It's dead, it's dead. How miserable. I've never been mighty in my life, and I'm dying like this. How miserable!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ In that instant, as if he had thought of something, he suddenly burst out with the last of his strength and bit at the big hand in the sky!When he died, he could bite the most powerful being in the chaos. It would be ... Very honorable!In my next life, I want to read more and become a reading Tiger. Then I don't have to be deceived, duped, or inexplicably beaten to death ... Yes, I must read more and learn how to read.BOOM!The seventh-rank Chaos Beast exploded in the air like tofu. The flying Tiger's mouth just happened to touch the huge palm.With these last few inexplicable thoughts, he closed his mouth ... With a crack, he actually bit a shallow wound on the palm.It seemed ... Worth it.The flying Tiger instantly crumbled and turned into dust.Yuan Shuo's fist had already descended.The power of the five elements completely exploded at this moment. Boom ...The power of order collapsed instantly.Yuan Shuo sneered coldly and punched out. The palm of order started to crack. Huntian's face turned ugly. In an instant, darkness descended!At this moment, the surface of his Dao of order was broken, and the power of evil emerged.

Chapter 3703 Demonic Sword Li Hao (3)
The huge palm instantly turned black."Die!"Huntian didn't hold back anymore. This attack might have surpassed some Overlord existences, but unfortunately ... He only had one attack.You want to hurt me? dream on.BOOM!The sound of an explosion rang out, and the aftershock shook and swept in all directions.The fist and palm crossed.The ninefold guards didn't even have a chance to react. Rumble ... The shockwaves of the battle were so intense that all of it happened so quickly that the weaker experts began to fall back, while the stronger ones were filled with rage, shock, and fear.Yuan Shuo ... He was just a weak cultivator.Why was he able to unleash such an attack?Even the four great five elements emissaries around him ... At this moment, someone saw them and wanted to save them. However, in just a moment, the power of the five elements and the power of darkness erupted and caused a shockwave.An explosive sound was heard!The four great emissaries 'faces were deathly pale as they lay limply on the ground. They watched as the shockwaves swept over. The powerful shockwaves that swept over made them feel ... Despair.They ... Were actually ... Going to die Here.Moreover, he had died in an extremely cowardly manner.They were powerful experts, very powerful ... However, as the power of the five elements in their bodies had been drained, they were only slightly stronger than ordinary venerable sovereigns. The powerful aftermath was clearly not something they could withstand.Hong long long ...The flying Tiger was the first to explode and die Here, becoming the first high-level expert to die Here.The four great emissaries had become sacrificial offerings and were ruthlessly destroyed at this moment. Energy fluctuations swept over, but the several grade 8 powerhouses didn't cause any waves in this place.Instead, he used the power of the five elements in his body to help Yuan Shuo, to help him with his punch.At this moment, a thought appeared in their minds ... They might as well ... Stay with Huo Yan.At that time, if they had died together with Huo Yan, perhaps ... Even if there was only a slight possibility, Daoist master Tian Fang might have won and resurrected them. However, they had surrendered and betrayed him ...And they, and huntian, had not established enough trust and friendship.If he died this time, he would probably really die.No one ... Would resurrect them.Huo Yan had died to maintain his master-servant relationship with Tian Fang, but they ... Didn 't.There was an inexplicable sadness.Why ... Why?Why was Yuan Shuo's spirit so powerful? it had actually seized the power of the five elements in their bodies. He was only a mere grade-7 ... Even if he had entered grade-8, he had only barely made it.A boom resounded through the heavens and earth.A slight muffled sound was heard.The fall of the four great emissaries didn't catch anyone's attention. Their energy had been drained, and their death didn't cause any waves.However, everyone's eyes blurred, and the fist and palm collided.As the power of darkness descended, the huge fist began to crack. The power of the five elements continued to explode, and the force God above Yuan Shuo's head was also collapsing.A muffled groan came from huntian.A faint crack appeared on his palm and it was still expanding. A drop of blood seeped out. Huntian's expression was cold.Looking at Yuan Shuo, that was all he could do.Do you like to borrow strength like your disciple?What was borrowed was still borrowed.Just as he was thinking about it, his expression suddenly changed and he took a step back. At this moment, a shadow seemed to appear in the void. A third hand suddenly appeared at the moment when Yuan Shuo was about to collapse.Even huntian didn't notice where this hand had come from.It had appeared in the void so suddenly.An invisible palm with a vicious aura appeared under the chaotic heaven banner, and a sinister smile appeared on Yuan Shuo's cracked face."Magical hands!"Yuan Shuo laughed. He laughed arrogantly, and his body was disintegrating.BOOM!Huntian's crotch exploded with a powerful energy that instantly shattered the giant palm. However, a hole appeared on his robe.It was a powerful sovereign weapon, but it was torn apart at this moment.Huntian's expression was extremely ugly.Although the scene that everyone had been anticipating did not appear, at this moment, he had lost all face. Not far away, the human King clicked his tongue and shook his head. It was a pity that he did not succeed. What a pity.I really want to see Yuan Shuo crush huntian with a single claw. What a pity!"I just tore my pants, I didn't have time to see the rest ... Is it too small?"The human King muttered to himself, but his voice spread out.Huntian's expression became uglier.At this moment, Yuan Shuo turned his head to look at Li Hao.He looked at the disciple he was proud of.How was it?In the distance.Li Hao was expressionless. At this moment, a murderous aura gradually appeared around him and expanded infinitely.His eyes were like the sun and the moon, but in an instant, they all turned into darkness.An extremely evil aura seeped out, as if a devil had descended.The world suddenly became much darker. The world was in complete silence, and the aura of death filled the air. At this moment, a long River of Death appeared in the entire Dao River, and the aura of death began to spread.His Dao domain began to expand rapidly.The suppressed rank eights felt like doomsday was upon them, their faces drained of blood.p Li Hao ... Had gone crazy.He had actually ... Used his master's death as an opportunity to completely become a demon.Was it worth it?Was there a need to?Huntian Supreme Emperor's expression was also ugly. He looked at the silent Li Hao, gritted his teeth, and said in a deep voice,""What are you trying to achieve by doing this? The world was so big, where couldn't the sky be split open? Why did you choose the West? You beast, sacrificing your master to the chaos, you are simply heartless to the extreme!"

Chapter 3704 Demonic Sword Li Hao (3 In 1)
In front of him, Yuan Shuo's body was collapsing.He smiled, and his flesh and blood evaporated bit by bit. He looked at Li Hao and said softly,""That's how it should be ... Kid ... This time ... You have a good reason to do so!"Huntian could not understand!He couldn't understand it either.Why did he do this?I've already given in!Li Hao had actually asked his master to fight him to the death ... He had a good reason to do so?What a joke!His strength was here.So what if he had a good reason?However, in the next moment, he seemed to realize that something was wrong. As Yuan Shuo slowly eroded away and shattered, Li Hao's aura soared crazily, and the power of a great Dao inexplicably strengthened.At this moment, Li Hao was looking at Yuan Shuo with no sadness, only a slight sound of breathing could be heard.There was no need to say goodbye.Today, I have successfully opened the sky, and my master is also in the new Sky.With the five elements body, chaos was reborn.If I die, there's naturally no need for that.The teacher had a good reason to do so, and the disciple would take over after the teacher died ... This was the martial world.'Hundun doesn't like the aura of the martial world. Then I'll ... Create it myself.'"Teacher, you'll be able to wait.""Hualala ..."The water of the long river roared between the heavens and the earth. It was as if the dead spirits had come back to life at this moment.The chaos great Dao emerged, and countless chaotic forces surged into the long river. Spirituality appeared on Li Hao's body, and the 5000 Dao laws began to shake. The heavenly order policy instantly turned into dust and fused with all the Dao laws.Huntian grunted.It was only at this moment that the others seemed to have completely come back to their senses.Spring Autumn opened his mouth wide!She had seen all kinds of people in her life, but she had never seen ... A disciple who made her teacher die in battle and become a magic medium.Yes, at this moment, Li Hao seemed to have been demonized in her eyes.The human King heaved a sigh of relief as he drew out his long blade. This brat was a little crazy and heartless ...Today, he was determined to succeed in opening the sky.You're really a good disciple. If your master doesn't die, he'll be letting down your good disciple ... What a bastard.Long Zhan's expression was solemn too.At this moment, he was in a dilemma. Li Hao ... Made him feel a slight chill, but huntian might be more difficult to deal with. Should he help Li Hao or help huntian stop Li Hao?In the Dao River, the six grade 8 experts were all ashen-faced.Countless huge waves came crashing down!The giant waves hit their skin and flesh as if they were going to melt them completely.Huntian's aura exploded. At this moment, he was completely enraged."Li Hao! Don't force me to kill you!"Li Hao raised his head, and a long sword appeared in his hand."I want this place of yours! You killed my master, so I'll take your Western Territory. This is fair! Huntian, if you retreat today, I won't kill you. If you stay, I'll kill you!"You want to kill me?What a joke!Huntian was furious! He had a good upbringing and was magnanimous enough. In other words, there was almost no one who could anger him. But at this moment, he was angered.Li Hao and his disciple were shameless to this extent.His master had been killed in battle because he had insisted on taking action. He had even humiliated him by killing the four great emissaries who had just surrendered ... Before he could get angry, Li Hao was extremely hypocritical and wanted to avenge his master!He seized our Western Territory and split open the sky for himself.What kind of logic is this?Bandits were nothing more than this!"Let's see if you have the ability to kill me!"Huntian couldn't bear it anymore and shouted,""Ninefold guards...Kill!" He ordered.Kill Li Hao!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Kill this shameless man.There was actually such a person in the chaos."Daoist master ..."At that moment, exclamations rang out. The six grade 8 powerhouses in the long river revealed looks of horror and despair. The 5000 Dao laws seemed to have come alive at that moment.Suddenly, it began to fluctuate and enveloped them in an instant.He wanted to skin them alive!One of the six cultivators roared and transformed into a kun Peng to escape.Some of them turned into black light, hoping to escape into the void and out of the river. Some were furious and desperate as they were swallowed by the great Dao.The aura of death filled the river.Li Hao looked at the firmament sword in his hand and smiled weakly.""Today might be your last battle since you've followed me here!"The firmament sword trembled slightly.It was as if it truly had a spirit.Was the sword ... Going to be completely gone?The firmament sword shuddered for a moment. Soon, it turned into madness, as if it was covered by a crazy aura.Li Hao wielded his long sword and casually waved it.Crack!The kun Peng that was about to fly out was killed by the sword. It fell into the river and became a part of it.On the other side, the ninth layer guards were furious.They charged at Li Hao crazily!Damn it!In an instant, one of the six rank-8s was killed by Li Hao, and the other two were devoured by the Dao law, strengthening it.The remaining three people were fleeing frantically.However, Li Hao, with a smile on his face, slashed out. Time seemed to pass by, as if thousands of years had passed. Above the long river, the three figures suddenly stopped moving. In just a moment ... The three swords seemed to have descended at the same time!Boom! Boom! Boom!Under Li Hao's sword, three level 8 powerhouses were ... Instantly killed.Although Li Hao had long extracted a lot of their DAOs, they were still at level 8. From the moment Yuan Shuo unleashed his power until now, Li Hao had killed six level 8 cultivators at an unbelievable speed.All of this happened in the blink of an eye.Huntian's aura appeared, and he was faster than the others. However, he was still a step too late. At this moment, he gritted his teeth and roared,""You're cutting off your only path of survival!"

Chapter 3705 Demonic Sword Li Hao (1)_5
Li Hao had killed six level 8 cultivators under his command.Just now, Yuan Shuo had whipped four of the surrendered emissaries to death. There were a total of 24 level 8s under his command. However, in the blink of an eye, 10 level 8s had died. It was as if ... Level 8s were nothing more than ants here.After fighting with chaos for half a day, he had only lost one grade seven cultivator.In the end, he even managed to subdue eight rank-7s.However, on this side, he did not do anything, and this pair of master and disciple, in the blink of an eye, killed 10 powerhouses of the eighth step under his command.They wouldn't rest until one of them died!The others were stunned. Everything had happened too quickly.But there were also people who were not shocked!The human King laughed as he wielded his saber. He then growled,""Kill! Kill huntian!"In an instant, a long saber appeared and cut through the heaven and earth. A cold shout resounded in all directions,""Since we've started, let's play! Li Hao, if you fail to split open the sky today, I'll look down on you. You'll kill your master to prove your Dao and taint the name of neo martial arts ... Of course, you're not a neo martial artist. If you can't split open the sky and resurrect your master, I'll kill you if you dare to escape!"Otherwise, you'll die Here.Otherwise, you'll succeed in splitting open the sky."If you see that you've failed and choose to escape in order to save your life, I, Fang ping ... Will kill you!He had always done what he said!He didn't care what methods Li Hao used to provoke himself, turn him into a demon, and drive him crazy ... But he didn't want to see a coward who forced his master to die and fled on his own.At worst, Li Hao would die Here too!Li Hao's laughter echoed, carrying an indescribable demonic quality.""Human King, I just said that you understand me, but you don't understand me anymore. "Today, if I don't split open the sky, I'll be benevolent. This is my Dao, and my master has fulfilled my wish. If I run away, I'll have no face to cultivate Dao anymore. I might as well kill myself. Why would I dirty the blade of the human King?"The long sword clanged, and the sound of the sword rang out in all directions.The chaos shook!The nine Heavens and earth shook violently. Li Hao smiled."Today, unless it's a battle between rank nines ... It's best if you don't participate!"Li Hao laughed heartily, and his longsword struck nothing!The chaos great Dao emerged. Li Hao ignored huntian and the others. Instead, he slashed his sword toward the chaos great Dao. Huntian had wanted to kill him, but he suddenly stopped.In the great Dao of chaos, there seemed to be statues and palms.Some sneered, some were angry, and some snorted."Savage!""Devil!"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Kill him!""You bastard!"“……”At this moment, it was as if all the ninth level venerable sovereigns were enraged.Li Hao had actually tried to cut off the chaos great Dao and stop them from arriving, not giving them a chance to participate.What a Savage devil swordsman! What right do you have to cut off the Dao of chaos?With the power of over 8000 DAOs you just unleashed?Are you qualified?​ "On what basis?"Li Hao smiled. In an instant, countless divine runes appeared in the air. They were so numerous that it was unbelievable. Ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million.They were densely packed!It seemed to appear out of thin air.The divine runes came from nowhere and gathered at this moment. Finally, they merged into Li Hao's sword. In an instant, the countless divine runes began to merge under Li Hao's smile!"Suppress!"Tens of thousands of divine runes merged into one and turned into a single divine rune. It was as if its spirituality had exploded and turned into a true spiritual rune, becoming the spirit of the great path.The divine text was extremely vast and slightly mixed. It was the divine text that countless humans in the divine Kingdom had cultivated under the Queen's orders until now. One was weak, and even ten thousand were weak ...However, the divine Kingdom had gathered countless humans. There were billions of them. At that moment, so many divine runes had gathered and fused into one, containing a large amount of power of faith.In just an instant, it seemed to suppress the spirituality of chaos.The divine text appeared, and the heavens and earth were suppressed!Huntian's expression changed!With a wave of his hand, he stopped the ninefold Guard's pursuit. At this moment, this divine rune suppressed the world and the chaos great Dao. If he was targeted, he might not be harmed, but the others, even if they had abstained from nearly 8000 great Dao, might be instantly suppressed and killed by Li Hao!Li Hao, this lunatic!He actually didn't use this against him, but ... To cut off the chaos great Dao, to stop the descent of a level nine, and to interfere with him opening the sky.What was he thinking?Or did he feel that ... His threat was not as great as those grade-9 beings who might not dare to come in person?At that moment, countless palms struck at the divine text!One by one, the illusions of level nine venerable sovereigns appeared with anger.What a Savage and bold person!Li Hao wanted to suppress their path of return. Although they hadn't decided whether to descend or not if Li Hao didn't suppress them, now ... Li Hao's provocation made even the level 9 experts who had been waiting to watch the show feel a little unbearable.It's our own choice whether we descend or not. It's not up to you to interfere!At this moment, Li Hao laughed. The next moment, he said coldly,""Tian Fang, are you still not going to stop?"Supreme Emperor Tian Fang, who was deep within the Dao, frowned.Li Hao, you're ... Ordering me?However ... In an instant, Li Hao's figure seemed to become much more illusionary. The next moment, Time and Stars merged into Li Hao's forehead, making him look extremely demonic!The stars of time bloomed with a faint radiance.At this moment, a dark tunnel appeared in Li Hao's eyes, leading to the four-sided domain.A ferocious Tiger appeared above Li Hao's head. The spirit that had exploded in the past seemed to have reappeared at this moment. The Tiger roared and instantly merged into the void. In just a moment, it seemed to have grabbed something.

Chapter 3706 Demonic Sword Li Hao (1)_6
The stars of time erupted endlessly. The power of time seeped out, suppressing the heavens and earth.BOOM!The chaos trembled, and even huntian and the others retreated, their eyes shifting.Huntian also seemed to have seen something.At this moment, a passage seemed to appear in the dark chaos. The fierce tiger above Li Hao's head was tearing at it.As for Li Hao himself, he held a longsword in his hand. The longsword instantly gathered the power from all directions, and among them, countless power of faith erupted. The originally invisible and almost invisible chaos channel appeared at this moment.After being slashed by Li Hao's sword, it cracked.In the depths of the primal Chaos, Tian Fang master's expression was cold!Li Hao!The space tunnel.This was prepared for his return, not just for the return of the heaven's side experts, but also for himself.The more strength they had, the stronger they would be. Even if they were the same level of strength, they would be able to surpass others!But now ... Li Hao was destroying it!Li Hao had never liked to rely on others, nor would he hope to accomplish everything without the help of others. He liked to plan ahead and kill all changes in advance!At this moment, Daoist master Tian Fang's voice reverberated.""What are you going to do?"Stop the other level nine?He would not do it.Li Hao could state his conditions.However, Li Hao seemed to have not heard him. He laughed and made a grabbing motion. In the distance, the Dao chess pieces suddenly felt a suction force. They were slightly stunned. The next moment, they hesitated for a moment and disappeared along with the suction force.It instantly fell into Li Hao's hand.In an instant, Li Hao's long sword fell on the chess piece, and the shadow of the chess piece appeared in shock and fear. You want to kill me?However, at this moment, some illusory chess pieces suddenly appeared on the chess board.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The power of the longsword instantly merged into it, and an invisible force of space seemed to be completely sucked out by the longsword. The power of faith assimilated all the Space Force, and the Dao chess piece felt empty!Almost all of its power was absorbed by Li Hao's power of sword truth.A spatial sword intent burst out at this moment.It was extremely powerful!The sword was drawn!Crack ... Boom ...The dark tunnel seemed to have completely emerged. Under this sword, it was directly cut off and began to collapse.In the endless void, Tian Fang's voice came,""Li Hao, it looks like ... You're not in the mood to talk about anything. I was a little hesitant before, but today, I no longer have any hesitation. I won't stop you from splitting open the sky, but ... After you split open the sky, it will be the day of your death!"Li Hao had cut off his passage.He fixed time and used the remaining spatial power in the chess piece to assimilate the power of the passageway. When he touched the spatial passageway, he cut it off.This destroyed Tian Fang's thoughts of returning early.Originally, Tian Fang was still hesitating. He was thinking that three generations might not be a good thing.However, no matter how bad they were ... They couldn't be worse than Li Hao.This was a complete lunatic who didn't care about what the world thought.He could even force his own master to die, just to ... Fight with his back to the water!Besides, we are outsiders.Was there anyone he couldn't kill? No more!No one was more ruthless than Li Hao in chaos. Even the human King, who made people self-destruct at will, seemed cold-blooded, but was actually truly compassionate. Li Hao ... Had completely fallen for the devil!The suppress word was still fighting against the other grade-9 divine words.Although the master of tianfang had made his decision, he would not stop others from shattering Li Hao's divine text.If there were any unforeseen circumstances during the process of splitting open the sky, it would still have to descend ...But at this moment, an illusory time passage appeared, and a figure was drawn over by Li Hao. The Queen appeared with a horrified look. The countless powerful auras made her ... Tremble!"Lingyue, do me a favor ..." Li Hao's smile was bright.Lingyue was on the verge of tears!This is a group of top-tier powerhouses, countless level 8 and level 9 powerhouses. I'm just a level 6 cultivator, what can I help you with?Li Hao's smile was brilliant."I'll suppress your divine Kingdom in the passage and spread the power of faith to the chaos great Dao!" I'd like to see who's willing to become the Savior of the human race. I'd also like to see who's willing to kill trillions of humans, walk out of the passageway, descend into the chaos, and stop me from opening the sky!""Li Hao!"At this moment, even Tian Fang couldn't hold it in any longer. He shouted, his voice reverberating through the chaos."You devil! The primordial chaos will be destroyed with you around!" At this moment, huntian and the others, be it Chun Qiu, long Zhan, or human King ... All of them stopped moving forward.The human King opened his mouth ... But didn't say anything. He only glanced at Li Hao and was speechless for a long time.The Queen was also stunned.But in the next moment, he gritted his teeth and stopped speaking. Suddenly, like a god, he activated something. In that instant, the sound of Sanskrit reverberated through the world, and countless devout voices resounded through the chaos.Countless humans were praying, and a beautiful divine Kingdom appeared between heaven and earth. Gradually, it began to merge into the chaos, and the power of faith spread out.It was as if ... They were waiting for their Savior.The ninth-rank attacks were gradually extinguished. The ninth-rank venerable sovereigns were like real stone statues, petrified.They ... Were being threatened.Yes, he was threatened.Li Hao!This refined man in many people's eyes had threatened them. He had threatened them with the lives of billions of human beings and the power of faith.Are you all going to descend?He could either shatter this divine Kingdom and kill everyone, or he could accept the power of faith and become the Savior of the human race!Choose one!Should he descend?Huntian's pupils constricted as he looked at Li Hao.In the past, when Li Hao used the four-sided domain to threaten long Zhan, he did not feel much. Today ... He truly witnessed this person's demonic nature and ruthlessness!After doing all this, Li Hao turned around, looked at everyone, and smiled.""Fellow Daoist huntian, the grade-9 cultivators won't stop me today. Of course, after splitting open the sky, lingyue will leave. Although I'm vicious, I still give people a chance to live. After splitting open the sky, the grade-9 cultivators ... Can descend as they wish!""Lingyue, once I successfully split open the sky ... You can leave. If I fail and die, you can leave too!"At this moment, the Queen, who had brought her God Country to suppress the chaos Dao, sighed.Crazy!She knew what kind of person you were, but she didn't expect that ... She laughed. She laughed happily. "Today, I, lingyue, suppressed more than 20 level nines by myself. Yes, I should be proud!""Alright, no one is stopping us. Everyone ... Have fun!"Li Hao laughed. His laughter resounded through the world.Ninth-rank, I'll have to wait for a while before I can come. Huntian, is it interesting?

3707 Chapter 600
The divine Kingdom suppressed the chaos great Dao.Li Hao was going to split the sky and the earth in the Western land. Chaos would be reopened, and the world would be reborn.At this moment, darkness had descended upon huntian.The order dissipated.Li Hao insisted on this. He no longer harbored any hope for peace. He had to stop Li Hao.At this moment, huntian looked at the others, at long Zhan, and said in a calm voice,""The human King stopped me, spring and autumn stopped me, both are right! You can stop me at another time ... But Li Hao opening the sky, opening the sky of chaos, opening the chaos, opening the chaos, cutting off the chaos, and the spirit of chaos will only be more scattered. You're also stopping me?"Li Hao was going to open the chaos here.Shaking up the chaos great Dao and even extracting the spirit of chaos was not necessarily a good thing for the chaos race.Long Zhan was also going to support Li Hao?In front of them, Li Hao was Walking in the Air. He wasn't in a hurry and left the people behind him in the dust, as if he was looking for the best spot.Long Zhan's expression changed.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ He and huntian had the same ambition. They both wanted to unify the chaos 'core, so stopping huntian from becoming stronger was what he wanted to do.However, Li Hao's sky-splitting ... Had to be stopped.When Li Hao split open the sky, he would certainly shake the chaos great Dao, consume the spirit of chaos, and weaken the chaos even more ... How could he let Li Hao succeed?Originally, it was a good thing to use up a level 9 descended spirit to split open the sky.But now, the tier 9 was truly not descending. However, it was the primal Chaos race that was suffering the most.Long Zhan's expression was somewhat heavy.The chaos race did not have any advantage in this place. The human race was the true power.He was so powerful that even a type 9 powerhouse would not dare to kill trillions of humans ... In front of other top powerhouses of the human race, even if they dared to do so in private, they would not dare to do so in public.In the chaos, humans were still the rulers.What to do?He took a deep breath. There was no other way out. At this moment, if he wanted to save Li Hao from being killed by huntian and strengthen huntian's forces, he should stop huntian.However, if Li Hao insisted on splitting open the sky, he would have to stop Li Hao.The situation changed rapidly!In this situation, a single mistake could lead to eternal damnation!Long Zhan shouted,"Li Hao, if you return to the East and huntian stops you, I'll definitely stop him!" If you choose to split open the heaven...You will be making an enemy out of us, the primordial chaos race!"Li Hao continued to move forward, and his voice drifted over.""I don't even want my master anymore, so why would I care if you're my enemy? Long Zhan, you overestimate yourself too much. If you stop me, I'll kill you. How simple is that!"It was that simple.Even master was forced to die. At this moment, do you still care about your attitude?He didn't care.Li Hao's voice was cold."Long Zhan, the energy to split open the sky might not be enough. Killing an expert from your race might make up for it. I tacitly agree that Chunqiu brought you here, and I know that you must stop me. Now, I'm giving you a choice, not you. If you insist on being my enemy ... I'll kill one or tens of millions of them. Whether the chaos can survive this tribulation depends on you, not me!" Behind him, the experts quickly caught up.Li Hao didn't stop. He seemed to be walking deeper into the nine Heavens.Huntian's speed was extremely fast. He didn't care about anything else and only shouted,""Stop the human King and spring and autumn!"The ninefold guards moved out quickly. At this moment, there were still ten type 8 powerhouses and four other type 8 powerhouses who had joined them. The leader was even more powerful and had shocking strength.Upon hearing the Dao master's order, everyone quickly turned around and charged towards new martial and spring and autumn.Long Zhan's eyes changed as he shouted,""Stop Li Hao from splitting open the sky!" Beside him, the expressions of the experts in the chaos realm changed. They were also a little happy. This should be it!Li Hao was their greatest enemy.Li Hao had killed too many experts of the chaos race and had grudges with several level eights. Feng Yan's mother, Black Tiger's cultivation partner, Qing Qiu's great-aunt, the Crimson Moon world ...These people, these worlds, had all been killed and destroyed by Li Hao.Long Zhan made peace with Li Hao previously. They were actually very dissatisfied. But long Zhan's prestige was too high. They were also helpless.Today ... They had fallen out with Li Hao, which was what they had hoped to see.In an instant, the black tiger's roar reverberated through the heavens and earth."Kill Li Hao!"Kill that bastard!Feng Yan was also very excited. Although they were weak, they were still at the eighth rank. At this moment, they were all excited and had hope of revenge.There were many level 8s on the human King plane's side, and there were many level 8s under Li Hao's command.However, there were not many experts.At that moment, the spring Autumn Emperor's expression changed and he shouted,""Human King, leave this place to them. Let's follow Li Hao ..."The human King's long blade slashed out, forcing the commander of the ninefold guards to retreat. However, the other party's strength was also shocking.The human King's long saber trembled, but they were actually evenly matched.And this was only one of huntian's subordinates, not huntian himself.The human King grinned. He was very strong!At this moment, huntian was still chasing Li Hao, and Li Hao was obviously no match for huntian. Long Zhan's men were charging toward Thunderlord and the others, while long Zhan also quickly rose into the air and headed straight for Li Hao.If the two of them worked together, Li Hao would die without a doubt."Whether it opens or not, it doesn't have much to do with me ..." The human King cursed.Why did he help Li Hao?I'm here to watch the fun!Li Hao opening the sky didn't do him any good.At this moment, the Supreme martial artist laughed and said,"go, leave this place to us!" It's fine if you're just here to watch the show, or you're here to borrow Li Hao's hand to kill all the strong enemies. Don't be so pretentious, Silver Moon. After all, he's from neo martial arts ..."

He chuckled, and the book of Dao appeared. Tens of millions of avatars appeared, looking in all directions, and he shouted in a low voice,""Spring and autumn realm experts, Silvermoon experts, and new martial artists, listen to my orders. Kill the experts of the chaos race and the chaos heaven realm!"Spring and autumn still had five Level 8 monsters.New martial and silver Moon also had many rank eights. If they joined forces, they would have more than ten rank eights.As for long Zhan and huntian, at this moment, there were also more than ten tier 8 experts. The gap was not big.More importantly, if the human King and Chunqiu left, the commander of the ninefold guards would be extremely difficult to deal with."Old Yang, can we stop him if we join forces?" the Grandmaster looked at the sun god.The sun god was speechless.The way these people addressed each other ... Really made him feel helpless.Could they be stopped?The commander of the ninefold guards was a powerful man with 8000 great Dao. He and Zhang Tao only had 4000 to 5000 great Dao cultivators. Even if three or four of them joined forces, they might not be able to defeat the commander.But now, the human King and Chun Qiu were not leaving, and Li Hao was fighting one against two, and they were two top-tier omnipotent experts at that. There was clearly no hope.The only way was to have human King and Spring Autumn leave and help Li Hao. It would be best if they could stop huntian so that Li Hao could fight long Zhan alone. It would be very difficult!But at this point, thinking that Emperor Yu might descend after the sky was split open ... The sun God's eyes turned cold and sharp as he nodded. "Let's try! But ... It's very dangerous!"The Grandmaster laughed.That's good. He laughed again."Your fist technique is unparalleled. Why don't ... You go first, and I'll go after!"艹!The sun god cursed in his heart. He was really inhumane. He was still using this trick at a time like this.But now that things had come to this ... There was nothing more to say.In the next moment, the aura of the Yang God was released, and divine runes appeared, suppressing the world. He shouted,""Old ghost, I'll fight you!"Heaven-shaking, earth-shattering fist strikes were unleashed toward withdrawal symptoms.Jiejie was also a top-notch Supreme Being. At this moment, seeing the human King escape from him and fly into the sky, his eyes were cold. His combat strength was not weak. In this place, Li Hao, long Zhan, and the human King all had around 8000 traces, which was equal to his.Chunqiu was stronger, so huntian was naturally stronger.If he were to be ranked in the top five, he would be in the top five no matter what.But now, the human King actually ignored him and went straight for the Dao master. He snorted coldly. 'Fine, since that's the case ... I'll take the opportunity to kill all the level eight neo martial artists, Silver Moon, spring and autumn, and then go help the Dao master!'  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Ninefold guards, chaos beings, listen to my command. Kill them!"His aura instantly exploded, becoming extremely powerful. He stabbed at the sun god. Although the sun god was strong, it was only relative. This powerful figure who had previously fused three bodies might have improved quickly, but compared to him, he was still far from it.Both sides had over 30 type 8 powerhouses, and they were engaged in a fierce battle.The heavens fell and the earth cracked!The barriers of the nine levels of heaven were breaking down crazily, engulfing the entire West.The sun god and the Supremes joined forces to fight against the top-tier master. Although they were no match for the other party, they could still hold on for a while. In reality, the two cultivators with nearly 5000 Dao ripples were far inferior to the other party.However, the key was that there was a cat here. It was silent and could appear at any time, and its fishing rod would appear above the other party's head from time to time, which annoyed the withdrawal sovereign. This cat was not to be trifled with.He was good at causing trouble.……Li Hao was still moving forward.Behind them, huntian, long Zhan, renwang, and Chunqiu were all rapidly chasing after them. Li Hao's speed was very fast, and it was as if he was walking on time. His figure flickered, and he disappeared in the blink of an eye.When he reappeared, he was already very far away.Huntian was no longer in a hurry.The further Li Hao went, the better. This place was the core of his Western Territory. If he fought here, the entire West would be blown up. Since Li Hao was willing to go far away, it would be best. It would be best if he went to the end of the West, the true edge of chaos.It was obvious that Li Hao had no intention of blowing up the West.Otherwise, if they stayed here, with so many experts taking action, the West would definitely be in chaos, completely destroying order.He could travel through space and time with one step.Li Hao kept moving forward. Behind him, the experts didn't fight but kept chasing.After a while, Li Hao stopped.In the distance, there seemed to be endless darkness.The violent land of chaos swept across the entire heaven and earth, but it did not cross a certain range, as if it was limited to one area. This place could be considered the end of the West, and perhaps one of the ends of chaos.Behind them was the vast Western Region.Li Hao stopped.Huntian instantly appeared and looked at Li Hao.""At least you're tactful!"It was still alright.It wasn't near the chaos heaven region.The human King and the others also quickly caught up. At this moment, the strength or speed of the others could be seen with a single glance. Chunqiu was more relaxed, while long Zhan and the human King were both slightly out of breath. The two of them were much faster than the others.However, chaos heaven was powerful, Spring Autumn specialized in time, and Li Hao specialized in time. They were all experts in traveling.These two people were slightly slower."F * ck, why did you run so far?" the human King sighed.I'm exhausted from the chase!He had run so far and old Zhang had been killed. He didn't even have time to rescue him.Abstinent was very powerful. Even if old Zhang and sun god joined forces, they would probably find it difficult to match him. For example, when the six rank eights fought Li Hao, they were easily defeated by him. Abstinent might not have as many tricks as Li Hao, but he was not much weaker than Li Hao."Huntian!" Li Hao turned around and looked at huntian."Is this the end of the chaos?""Chaos?" Li Hao was confused."Chaos is ... The only one?"It was just like a world. In a world, one would think that the world was unique, but when one left the world and entered the chaos, one would realize that the world was not unique.

And there were many more!Countless worlds!Being in this mountain, he didn't know that there was a mountain outside.Huntian, on the other hand, had regained his calm. At this moment, he even had the mood to reply,""No one has ever walked out of the chaos. Whether the chaos is unique or not, perhaps ... Only by walking out will we know. Moreover, there's no need to know now. Even the chaos has not been unified, so what else can we talk about?"This was not important.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ That's right!Li Hao nodded."This place is not bad. It's quiet and peaceful. It's close to order."As soon as he finished speaking, a long river appeared and ran through the world!Tributaries and stars emerged and turned into boundaries. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be surrounded by a world. He was surrounded by boundaries. The peaceful edge of chaos was no longer quiet.The long river billowed!"This place is fine!"At this moment, the huge commotion seemed to have attracted the attention of some living beings in the surroundings.At this moment, in the quiet western edge, at the end of the chaos, some living beings seemed to sense something. In an instant, the place was no longer quiet!Li Hao didn't delay anything.Countless realms surrounded him, and the heavens and earth changed colors. All the great DAOs in the entire area seemed to be destroyed and expelled by him.Huntian appeared in the blink of an eye!The human King and spring and autumn also appeared. Spring and autumn had tens of thousands of incarnations. At this moment, he had even returned to his original form. It was a small, crystal-clear cicada, and it was extremely beautiful."Huntian, so what if we let him open the sky?"With the cry of spring and autumn, it was as if the world had recovered. The sun and moon appeared, and time and space became brilliant.So what if I let him open the sky?Huntian remained silent.If this matter didn't concern him, he would act high and mighty!Spring Autumn made it sound so simple, but why don't you let Li Hao split open the sky in the South?I would also say, so what if I let him open the sky!He didn't say anything. As the power of darkness attacked, the entire chaos trembled violently. Li Hao's long river was instantly pushed away. At this moment, Li Hao ignored the sun, moon, and stars above his head.Long Zhan transformed into a giant Golden Dragon and soared into the sky, heading straight for Li Hao!Huntian could deal with two of them.He was trying to stop Li Hao from stealing the spirit of the chaos great Dao.The Golden Dragon roared and its tail pierced through the void. With a single strike, the river trembled and the stars shattered. A powerful force emerged between the heavens and earth, shattering even the chaos.p In an instant, long Zhan appeared near Li Hao, his huge eyes filled with coldness."Li Hao, stop!"At this moment, long Zhan actually knew that Li Hao would not stop, but at this moment ... He was actually very complicated. In his eyes, Li Hao was a key figure in dealing with a ninth step. He didn't want to be Li Hao's enemy at this moment.It was true.He had accepted Spring autumn's invitation not to deal with Li Hao, but the situation had changed too quickly, and he had no choice but to stop Li Hao.Li Hao did not say anything.5,000 realms appeared and surrounded him. The powerful energy swept across the entire world.He looked at long Zhan. That Golden Dragon's aura was unbelievably strong. His blood Qi was so strong that it could almost shatter the chaos. Long Zhan seemed to be even stronger than before.Li Hao laughed. A long sword appeared and slashed out. The worlds were like big stars, and the 5000 stars instantly turned into a straight line.There were thousands of great DAOs, and their arrangement changed.Five thousand stars, at this moment, in a formation, also turned into a giant dragon. Under the command of the long sword, they charged straight at long Zhan!As for Li Hao himself, he didn't get close.The other party was a peak expert in the Dao of physical body. There was no benefit in getting close to him.The sun, the moon, and the stars appeared in Li Hao's eyes. In an instant, a time star appeared on his forehead. At this moment, time fluctuated and glowed.Splitting open the sky wasn't as simple as splitting open a space.It was quite troublesome!Li Hao had simulated it several times, but he was still a little nervous at this moment. He took a deep breath. Suddenly, the stars of time began to collapse. Thousands of DAOs and small worlds appeared one after another. The entire world seemed to be covered by time.At this moment, the entire world began to shake.One by one, the stars of the great path suddenly turned into a line, as if wanting to wrap up the entire void space, wrapping long Zhan within it too.In all directions, it was as if long rivers had appeared and surrounded the world.The Dragon's giant tail swept over!His vitality was extremely strong, and his body broke through the air. With a single blow, several stars were shattered. Li Hao snorted."Long Zhan is blocking me, but it's hard to split the sky. Splitting the sky can't be done in an instant."He turned his head to look at long Zhan. At this moment, long Zhan's combat strength was incomparably valiant. He rampaged all the way, shattering all the sword Qi that blocked him.Under Li Hao's nourishment, the firmament sword was already very powerful. At this moment, it was still hit by the dragon's tail, and sparks flew in all directions. Countless cracks appeared, which were quickly repaired, and then broken again.Li Hao frowned slightly and reached out his palm. Drops of blood appeared on his fingers and dripped into the world. The blood solidified and seemed to turn into li Haos. Each Li Hao walked into the firmament sword and merged with it.Two divine runes appeared on the divine sword.The heavens!"I shall suppress the heavens with my blood!""Heaven and earth!" With a low growl, the divine runes in the sky burst with brilliant light. The entire chaos seemed to have an additional heaven and earth. At this moment, the four directions seemed to have divided the world!The two divine runes absorbed countless drops of blood. In an instant, heaven and earth attacked together!Sword Qi filled the air!Streams of powerful sword intent struck towards long Zhan. And outside, the three great experts exchanged blows. It was also chaotic and lightless, tens of thousands of sword intents were annihilated!
