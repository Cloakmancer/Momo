        ok at it. If we can't finish it today, we'll just rest for a day or two.)
         On the third day.
         Heavenly Star City.
         Tomorrow would be the day Li Hao would be beheaded three days later. On this day, stellarsky city was too depressing.
         Li Hao Ran away!
         The news spread far and wide. Countless aristocrats pushed for it. Some aristocrats shouted,"Li Hao is just joking. If he dares to kill an aristocrat in public, he'll die!"
         There were also relatives of the captured aristocrats who went straight to the night patrol and demanded that the night patrol release the captured aristocrats.
         The executioner Li Hao has already run away, and you guys still want to persist?
         The Wei Wu Army had sealed off the courtyard and replaced the night watchmen. However, the pressure also came with it.
         Even within the night patrol, several deputy ministers started to make a fuss.
          He wanted to release her!
         This couldn't go on. Thousands of nobles were being detained. It was fine with Li Hao around, as someone would take the blame. Now that Li Hao was missing, what if they didn't release him?
         The yellow Dragon was one of the representatives.
         However, with hou Xiaochen's appearance, the clamoring died down a little.
         ……
         The night patrolman.
         At this moment, it was packed with people.
         It was not just the people outside. Some of the nobles who had been locked up for days in the courtyard also received the news. Some of them sneered. "Let's see how long he keeps us locked up!"
         "Too crazy, too sharp, there won't be a good end!"
         "Weren't you scared to death two days ago? You're not afraid now?"
         “……”
         All the nobles laughed heartily, regardless of how sour their bodies were.
         Li Hao had run away!
         Of course, there was a similar situation last time, but last time, he only faced the First Division. This time, it was the world.
         It was different.
         Someone in the crowd looked at mu Xiaorong and chuckled.""Miss mu, at this point ... Shouldn't you go out? Chief mu is probably anxious too. Why don't we go out together? I don't think these northern barbarians would dare to touch a single hair of ours!"
         Someone looked at the grandson of the North Sea King and laughed."Brother Yu, the King of the North Sea is probably waiting for you to return and reunite with him."
         The young man smiled and did not say anything.
         Li Hao had once mentioned that he was brothers with the grandson of a pirate, and he was now showing it to the fullest.
         Because his grandfather was the North Sea King!
         The Pirates of the North Sea had tens of thousands of superpowers and many powerhouses. In this era, even the aristocrats had times when they had to yield. For example, if the other party was very, very strong ... If Li Hao didn't kill indiscriminately, everyone would yield.
         However, when Li Hao killed them, no one would be willing to do so.
         These two were the ones with the highest status.
          However, neither of them said that they would leave. All of a sudden, the nobles began to hesitate.  "Aren't you two leaving? There's nothing here, and there's a group of people watching us. There are thousands of people here, and it's so smelly ..."
         Someone complained.
         But ... In the depths of her heart, she was still a little afraid.
         The next moment, a young man walked out with a cold and arrogant expression.""If none of you are leaving, then I'll leave first! I'll see who dares to stop me!"
         After saying that, he stepped forward.
         The Wei Wu Army was guarding the entrance.
         At this moment, he was looking at the young man coldly.
         The young man sneered and took out a token that he always carried with him.""You're all blind! I'm Zhou Chao, a high-level city patroller! My father is the Deputy Minister of the night patrolmen. Li Hao has locked me up for a few days. Do you have any evidence to prove that I have committed a crime? Get out of the way ... Otherwise, no one will be able to protect you!"
         The Wei Wu Army soldiers did not make a sound and did not make way. They unsheathed their swords.

         That was impossible!
         A Silver Moon Martial Master wasn't stronger than anyone else. He didn't have an extra pair of hands or extra guts.
         However, the Silver Moon Martial Master was a little more unreasonable!
         He was more unafraid of death!
         Not too far away, Chen Jin walked over with a greataxe in his hand. He looked at the young man, then grinned."Come out and I'll hack you to death! Governor li isn't here, and Minister hou hasn't said anything. Come out and try!"
         "Chen Jin!"
         The youth clearly recognized Chen Jin. He said coldly,"You have to know that this is Heavenly Star City! This wasn't the uncivilized land that Silver Moon was in! I gave Li Hao some face and gave him three days to investigate. It's been three days, so I don't think you have the right to detain me!"
         The noise attracted the attention of many people.
         The people in the courtyard all looked over.
         Outside the courtyard, some night patrollers were watching silently from a distance.
         Big eyes and the other two were also quietly watching from a distance. Their eyes were a little strange. Minister Zhou's son was coming out.
         Li Hao wasn't there, and hou Xiaochen had disappeared after showing up.
          But today, Minister Zhou was among the night patrollers.
         Minister Zhou and Minister Huang were on the same side. Minister Yao didn't care about anything, while Huang and Zhou represented the night watchers. However, his son had been detained by the night watchers until today.
         Zhou Chao's revolt was not a spontaneous decision.
         The three of them instantly figured it out. Perhaps it was a test, or perhaps it was a coercion. In any case, the two division ministers were nearby. One was transforming, and the other was at the peak of the rising light. They were confident that they could stop Li Hao from doing something when he returned.
         His big eyes glanced over and transmitted his voice,""Zhou Chao is at the peak of the three suns realm, while Chen Jin is only a douqian Martial Master. The difference is obvious. On the Wei Wu Army's side, Jin Jin seems to have gone into seclusion. Mu Lin's strength is not weak, but his main focus is defense ... In the entire Wei Wu Army, other than the two of them, there's probably no one who can do anything to Zhou Chao. "
         After he said that, he looked around.
         At this moment, many night watchers walked out.
         There was the rising light, the three suns, and also those below the three suns.
         There were many experts in the night patrolman headquarters. The directors and Deputy Directors were at least at the peak of the rising light Stage or at the transformation stage.
         Apart from hou Xiaochen and Huang Long, the other three were all peak sunguang-class experts.
        
         There were many other rising light powerhouses, such as Hu Qingfeng and the three of them.
         At this moment, everyone was watching.
         There was complete silence.
         There were a total of 11 night patrollers, including hou Xiaochen. One of them was the head, and the other 10 were the Deputy. Almost all of them were at the headquarters. Even those who weren't there before had rushed back in the past two days.
         A Deputy Minister walked out of the office building and looked over with a slight frown.
         After Li Hao left, Huang Long and the others couldn't sit still anymore?
         At this moment, hou Xiaochen's intimidation wasn't even as strong as Li Hao 's.
         This was because everyone knew that hou Xiaochen was an old official, and sometimes had some scruples. Li Hao, on the other hand, was a pure Martial Master. His official position had been given to him in an instant, and he had never been in politics.
         As a result, everyone was afraid of hou Xiaochen, but that didn't mean they were afraid.
         But towards Li Hao ... It was fear!
          He was a man who had killed people like flies!
         Not far away, Huang Long and Deputy Minister Zhou also walked together. They just looked at each other in silence and did not speak.
         However, this was also a form of pressure.
         There were other people beside the two of them. They were not night patrols, but some high-ranking officials, such as a Deputy Secretary of the Internal Affairs Department, a Deputy Secretary of the military law Department, a governor of the Ministry of Rites and Foreign Affairs ...
         They walked out at the same time. In an instant, Zhou Chao, who was in the distance, seemed to have received a blessing. He angrily rebuked,""Chen Jin, don't be lawless! This is heavenstar, I'm a high-rank City Patrol, what are you? Where did you get the right to stop me? Or even detain me? Back down!"
         "Are the Wei Wu Army rebelling?"
         Zhou Chao berated!
         The eyes of some of the nobles in the surroundings flickered as they began.
         The night patrolmen started to force him to abdicate.
         Forcing hou Xiaochen to release her.
         They've already released him. Even if you, Li Hao, come back, do you still dare to rush into a Noble's house to kill people?
         In the distance, many experts stood.
         In the courtyard, some people saw it and some were extremely excited. They whispered,""My grandfather is here!"
         "My father is here too ..."
         "Hahaha!"
         "I can finally go out. These few days ... It's been so unbearable. I don't want to come to this damn place again in my life."
         "Same!"
         “……”
          The nobles were extremely excited. They had finally seen their loved ones. These past few days, they had been suffering, extremely suffering.  Previously, their families had asked them to wait and think of a solution, but there had been no news for several days. They were extremely anxious. Tomorrow was the deadline set by Li Hao. In fact, the list should have been decided by tonight.
         But until now, no one had made a decision.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He couldn't do that. He had to wait for news from the outside. Otherwise, he would easily offend people.
         Some of the smaller nobles were excited even though they didn't see their relatives because they had the highest chance of being selected.
         Now that the great aristocrats had begun to counterattack Li Hao, they could bask in the glory and not die.
         Who wants to die?
         Who would want to die when they were living such a comfortable life, living a life of luxury, and having free time on the four islands?
         ……
         The department head's office.
         Yao si also looked on silently. Beside him, Xiao Ye helped to introduce in a low voice,""That's Zhou Chao, Minister Zhou's son. "
         Yao si picked up the tea jar and drank a cup of tea. In the tea, there was no longer any spring of life.
         He just looked at it and was silent for a while. Then, he said softly,""He's guilty?"
         "This ... No... There's no such ..."
         Xiao Ye was very nervous. She had only become a night patrolman five years ago and knew this old Minister quite well. Of course, what she knew was that ... He drank tea and read the newspaper every day and did not care about anything.
         Five years ago, she had thought that this man was a hero of the world. Five years later, she no longer thought so. This man ... Was old!
         Yao si said softly: "it's just the two of us. What are you afraid of? whether he is guilty or not, we are just trying to understand him. What do you think of him?"
         Xiao Ye was a little nervous. However, the old Minister had never been harsh with people. He had only gotten angry once a few days ago.
          Thinking of this, she lowered her voice and whispered,""This Zhou Chao ... Is not a good person. I don't know much about other things, but on the night patrolmen's side, he ... He forced a lot ... A lot of sisters, but no one dared to say it out loud. The Minister also knows that on our side, there are not many people with power and influence. Many of them are strong people recruited from the common people ... There are some young martial masters, some Starlight, and dark Moon. Everyone knows that the night patrolmen are Orthodox, so they all joined us. When they encounter such things, they just close their eyes and let it go."
         This was the night patrolman, not the nine divisions.
         In fact, there were not many aristocrats, because the night watchers were originally set up to be scapegoats. The nine divisions had power, but they were not willing to go to war with the three major organizations.
         The night patrolmen were considered cannon fodder.
         Later on, Yao si became stronger. After 15 years, the night patrolmen had gained a firm foothold and gathered a large number of martial artists and superpowers from the common people. Only then did they have today's strength, which could even challenge Jiusi.
         Yao Si was still calm."They are all family. The supers in the Department are all fighting for them. They find women and there are whorehouses too. What is he thinking about laying his hands on his own family?"
         It was a matter of mutual consent. It was not like he could not find a woman, it was not like he had no money or power, and it was not like no one would take the initiative to throw themselves into his arms. He was the son of a dignified Deputy Minister, and he himself was also at the peak of three suns. Was he afraid of not having a woman?
         Seeing that the department head didn't say anything, Xiao Ye was a little disappointed, but she quickly hid it and forced a smile.""We're all nobles, so maybe ... We like this. "
         After saying that, he smiled and did not say anything else.
         He could not hide his disappointment.
        
         She said it!
         She had taken a great risk, even at the risk of being found out by Minister Zhou, to tell him that this Zhou Chao was a villain and a sinner. He would not even let his own people off.
         But ... The Minister only asked,"why?"
         Why?
         I don't know why. I only know that you're all the same. Fortunately, I didn't say much. I didn't say anything else, not even worse. I only mentioned it briefly.
         At this moment, Xiao Ye laughed at herself in her heart ... She knew that things would turn out like this.
         If he had known, he wouldn't have said a word.
         In the Minister's eyes, what was a few months of the glory of the Dark Sun?
         They all came from the common people, some weak god tier Masters blessed by the heavens, or some weaklings who were lucky enough to draw energy into their bodies. Minister Zhou was Minister Huang's right-hand man, and he was even at the peak of the rising light Stage ...
         Then, he thought of the funny person he had seen at first sight.
          He was wearing a trench coat, a top hat, and holding a scepter ... That night, she went downstairs and saw him. She only felt that he was so funny and interesting.
         However, thinking about it today ... What a domineering man!
         If there were more people like this in this world, would it still be like this?
         But ...
         The fire in her heart was instantly extinguished.
         If he left, the whole world would want to kill him.
         No one stepped forward to help him. Not a single one of the nine divisions stepped forward, not even the inspector Bureau. As for the night patrols, other than hou Xiaochen, who was still supporting him, not a single higher-up stepped forward to help him.
         He ... The way he ran away in a sorry state might have been very miserable.
         Could he be blamed?
         It can 't!
         He seemed to be only 20 years old. He might have gone to the inspection Office hoping that someone would help him, but no one was willing to stand up for him.
         At that moment, Xiao Ye's heart was like dead ashes.
         'I'm just a Night Watcher. I'll just continue being this old man's Secretary. At least ... This old man won't treat female superpowers like prostitutes!'
         Perhaps, they preferred the resistance of women with superpowers ... But who would dare to resist?
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The light in Xiao Ye's eyes dimmed instantly, and a smile returned to her face. Just like the female manager, this was how the world worked. If you couldn't resist, then you had to live.  He was alive!
         Yao si turned to look at her. After a long time, he suddenly whispered,"Xiao Ye, do you know someone?"
         "Minister, you mean?"
         "Yun Haoran."
         Xiao Ye was first stunned, then stunned. In the next moment, her face flushed red, but it quickly turned into grief. Her expression changed quickly and was filled with disbelief.
         A moment later, it turned into dead silence.
         He forced a smile."Yes, I do. Yun Haoran, the president of the Heavenly Star ancient Academy. He's a great scholar who has been promoting education for all. He hopes that all people can receive education and do their best to promote the development of ancient civilization technology. He took the initiative to open up some technologies to the public, such as cement manufacturing and land reclamation. He once promoted the technological wave of machines that will reform the world ..."
         "Star origin calendar year 1725. Yun Haoran wanted to contact the various great ancient Academies to establish 10000 more primary and secondary schools to accept 10 million students ... In the end, he died as soon as he reported to the ninth Bureau ... He died in his own home. On that day, a super expert from three large organizations sneaked into stellarsky city and killed people everywhere, including Dean Yun."
         "His entire family, young and old, seems to have all died ..."
         When Xiao Ye finished speaking, she was very calm."With Dean Yun's death, all Technology Promotion will be terminated! The Heavenly Star ancient Academy closed its doors and all its students and teachers were expelled. The ancient academy became the Heavenly Star super Academy of today. "It's said that the teachers from back then either died or fled. Not many of them are still alive. Many of the students have left stellarsky city ..."
         After saying this, he laughed again."Five years ago, actually ... Actually, I wanted to join the ancient academy and learn some skills. Later, the ancient academy was gone, and I happened to draw energy into my body. I came to the night patrol and was lucky to be valued by the Minister. Plus, I can read a few words, so I became the Minister's Secretary ... I'm quite lucky."
         Yao si slightly nodded,"Did you know?" I know him, and I'm quite familiar with him. "
         Xiao Ye was stunned.
          "Can you guess if he's a superhuman?" Yao si continued.
         Xiao Ye frowned."I've never heard of him. He's an ordinary person, right?" she asked.
         "No, no, no. He's a superpower. In fact, he's a superpower converted from a Martial Master. Five years ago, on that day, he had just broken through to the rising light realm."
         Xiao Ye was stunned.
         Five years ago ... Sunguang!
         The sunrise at that time was no less powerful than a divine power now, right?
         Of course, even if there were some differences, it should be equivalent to the current transformation period, right?
         But ... She was a little dazed."No, it's said that they captured the members of the three major organizations that day and killed a few of them. They were all sunlit. It seems ... It seems that one of the three suns was also killed. At that time, the three suns were extremely powerful. Everyone thought that Dean Yun was too unlucky to have met the three suns ..."
         Yao si chuckled,"that's right ... We caught the murderer and killed him. We gave the world an explanation. Therefore, everyone quickly forgot about it. If we don't catch the murderer, it will be hard to explain." "Yun Haoran was a world-famous institution, after all. The Heavenly Star ancient Academy was the head of the education field, the pioneer of technological reform, and dedicated to the study of people's livelihood ... Every move of his involved all the ancient Academies in the world. At that time, some intellectuals were absorbing the cultural and technical research of the Heavenly Star ancient Academy ..."
         "So, in the past few years, things have changed very quickly. Building cars, houses, machines, planes, cannons, TV, communication ... Clothing, food, housing, and transportation involved a wide range of things. It was pushed halfway ... And it stopped abruptly!"
        
         He sighed and looked ahead.""After he died, I gave up my power. I think ... This era is too dangerous! I'm too weak, my arms can't win against my thighs. "
         Xiao Ye, what does that mean?
         Was the Minister and Dean Yun good friends?
         Five years ago, Yun Haoran had died.
         Five years ago, the Minister began to officially delegate power. He was no longer involved in the matters of the night patrollers and was left to Huang Long to take charge.
         Yao si no longer spoke.
         However, he seemed to be looking at something ... He seemed to have seen the famous master. However, he had died a terrible death. In the end, he couldn't escape death and his name had been forgotten. At that time, the people of the star dynasty were not well-informed. How could they have such a smooth news today?
         However, at that time, many things were created and promoted by him.
         At that time, there were people who protected him. For example, there was an old man among them. His name was Yao si ... Later on, Yao si also gave up. He went into silence and dormancy. Once Yun Haoran died, that ray of light was gone.
         He, Yao si, was no match for those people.
          Today ... Someone else was going to step forward, and he was even fiercer and more ruthless than Yun Haoran!
         Yun Haoran was only making technological changes in a gradual and gradual manner.
         As for this person, he wanted to first kill people to establish his authority, using martial arts to reform and force the upper echelons to give in.
         Who was more brilliant?
         Yao si didn't know.
         They only knew that ... Yun Haoran was dead, and Li Hao ... Was in even more danger!
         In the distance, the conflict had escalated.
         Zhou Chao's aura burst forth as he roared in anger,""Get lost! Do you believe that I'll execute you on the spot in the name of insubordination?"
         ……
         Chen Jin wielded his greataxe, his eyes flashing with killing intent.
         He was unable to move.
         He was a warrior of thousands, not a cultivator of skandha. He believed that he could kill those at the peak of the sun glory realm, but it was difficult for him to deal with the three suns. Unless he formed a formation, he had no hope of dealing with those at the peak of the three suns.
         A few Qian fighters rushed over from the surroundings.
         When Chen Jin saw that they had arrived, he took a deep breath, and the greataxe in his hand trembled. Zhou Chao's eyes were ice-cold."What, you want to attack me? You'd better think it through, going against your superior is a capital crime!"
         He seemed to be forcing her on purpose!
         The fury in Chen Jin's heart rose. Capital crime?
         You are the prisoners!
         The axe in his hand trembled more and more. He wanted to kill, kill these people, bastards!
         This Zhou Chao was nothing. He had done all kinds of dirty things. They had been on night patrol for more than a month. What kind of rumors had they not heard?
         Even the night patrols had heard about this. At the start, some of them had even warned the female martial masters in the Wei Wu Army to be careful of Zhou Chao. It was only after hou Xiaochen's display of power that some people started to fear him.
         "Get lost!"
         "Did you hear that?"
         Zhou Chao took a step forward with a hint of coldness in his voice. It was as if he was not afraid of the other party making a move, but rather, he had to be brave enough to do so.
         Not far away, Huang Long and the others were like mountains, oppressing everyone.
         Huang Long and the others weren't looking at that, but at the other branch tower. That was hou Xiaochen's territory.
         ……
         Long building.
         Hou Xiaochen only looked on, but Chief Steward Yu's anger burned.
         She wanted to go down and kill someone!
          "There's no rush, just wait!"Hou Xiaochen said softly.  "Minister!"
         Chief Steward Yu's killing intent rose."I want to kill someone!"
         Who would dare to force the Silver Moon Martial Master like this?
         Who would dare to challenge the Silver Moon Martial Master?
         A piece of trash, a piece of trash, how dare he!
         "Let's wait a little longer ..."Hou Xiaochen said calmly,"we'll let them know that being weak is what it is. They'll get beaten up, they'll be humiliated, and they'll lose all their dignity!"
         Who?
         Chen Jin and the others.
         The martial masters had declined ... This was what everyone said.
         You're too weak, so you can't do anything.
         The long spear slowly appeared in his hand and he said softly,""Wait a minute ... I want to wait for Chen Jin to make his move ... And then ... Kill them!"
         Since Li Hao was missing, he ... Would give Li Hao a good example.
         Huang Long, do you think that I would not dare to kill you?
         Or do you think that you can be unscrupulous just because you have a few more metahumans by your side?
         ……
         Chen Jin wielded his greataxe. He had always been a hot-tempered person.
         At this moment, he was even more furious.
         In the next moment, he suddenly roared and struck out with his axe. He roared,""Dog, I'll slaughter you!"
         BOOM!
         Zhou Chao was shocked. You really dared to make a move?
         His father, the Deputy secretaries, and Huang Long were behind him. They were all top experts. He thought they wouldn't dare to.
         Of course, it would be best if he dared to.
         He suddenly laughed!

         "Chen Jin and the other northern barbarians really can't take provocation. They actually dared to attack me. This time ... Even hou Xiaochen won't be able to protect you."
         The gold element power exploded!
         BOOM!
         With a punch, a golden light shone in all directions. Zhou Chao sneered,""How dare you, Wei Wu Army! You dare to attack me? a Crooked Stick will have a crooked shadow. Today, I will kill you and eliminate the traitors among the night patrollers!"
          At that moment, Huang Long and the others all turned to look at hou Xiaochen, who had already revealed his face.
         The eyes of the Deputy secretaries flickered.
         "Be careful," the Deputy Secretary of internal affairs said to Huang Long."This guy can't be weak. He might even ... Have the ability to kill and transform. The Secretary speculated that it might be close to a god art ... Of course, we're not here to kill him. We just need to stop him ..."
         "Don't worry, I know what I'm doing!"
         Huang Long's eyes were also filled with anger as he looked at hou Xiaochen. "If you dare to make a move ... I'll use the power of the nine divisions to get rid of you!"
         In the distance, there was a loud bang!
         Chen Jin retreated several steps. His hands were covered in blood, but he was still as berserk as ever. With a furious roar, he chopped down with his giant axe.
         The heaven splitting axe!
         BOOM!
         It was as if the earth was splitting apart and the sky was splitting apart. It was extremely powerful, but ... The difference in strength was too great. Peak of the three suns, inner strength of thousands of people. Zhou Chao's super power exploded and he also threw out a punch, which was shining in all directions.
        
         The expressions of the several Centurions around him were all unsightly.
         Zhang Yang from the five tigers broken blade sect, Xie Lan from the Jade sword sect, Wu Yue, the inheritor of the heart-crushing palm ...
         A few martial masters revealed a fierce look.
         Seeing that the successor of the mountain splitting axe, Chen Jin, was about to be defeated, the few of them looked at each other and nodded at the same time. In an instant, the few warrior chasers attacked one after another with irresistible force and ferocity!
         "Kill!"
         "Kill!"
         Beside him, the hundreds of Wei Wu Army soldiers roared. They held weapons and were abnormally fierce. This scene made some of the aristocrats cower.
         A bunch of trash comparable to Yue Ming ... Had actually ... Raised their weapons at them!
         "A bunch of trash, all of you!" Zhou Chao also shouted coldly.
         It's just a few more Qian douluos. Do you think the power of the peak of three suns is fake?
          "Break!"
         He threw out a punch, but in the next moment, his expression changed slightly. Chen Jin was fighting to the death, not retreating at all. He swung his axe down, and explosive roars rang out continuously. He didn't retreat at all, only ferociously and ferociously. He was going to resist this punch and let the other personalities kill Zhou Chao!
         Swords, Spears, and sabers appeared one after another. A few Qian fighters cooperated tacitly, and the power of Qian fighters burst out one after another.
         Zhou Chao's eyes were dazed, as if he had been shocked.
         This scene caused hou Xiaochen to be slightly startled, and he slowly retracted the spear he was about to use.
         Huang Long and the others ... Were also stunned.
         There were only five Dou Qian martial masters.
         In other words, it was five sunlit cultivators fighting one peak three-yang cultivator.
         Originally, the two sides could not be compared at all.
         However, at this moment, Zhou Chao seemed to be in shock. The Martial master's ferocious momentum and fearless charge made Zhou Chao, the young master of superpowers, a little timid for a moment.
         Deputy Minister Zhou furrowed his brows a little and felt a little embarrassed.
         His son ... Was at the peak of the three yang realm!
         It was unknown how many good things he had used to reach this stage, but now, he was intimidated by a few bumpkin martial masters. This was too embarrassing.
         Zhou Chao seemed to be at a disadvantage. He was struck by the heart-crushing palm, and he vomited blood non-stop. He even panicked. If this continued, he might really be killed ...
         Deputy Minister Zhou was a little angry and also a little anxious. He looked at a man not far away.
         That was his person, early stage rising light.
         It was enough!
         In fact, if there was another three suns, these people would not be able to stop them. But just in case, he still signaled to the man to deal with these guys.
         How troublesome!
         ……
         BOOM!
         The five douqian martial masters took action and actually gained the upper hand in an instant. The heart-crushing palm hit the other party, and Zhou Chao was also somewhat flustered as he vomited blood. His golden fist was slightly damaged by the mountain splitting axe Chen Jin's axe, and blood flowed out.
         Zhou Chao let out a blood-curdling screech and hurriedly retreated.
         Behind them, mu Xiaorong and the others just watched. Looking at Zhou Chao's attitude, they were somewhat disdainful and speechless. You're at the peak of the three-sun realm, but you can't even fight against the Joint Forces of five thousand-man Warriors.
         To think that you were still clamoring non-stop just now!  The descendants of the noble families were also speechless. Some were afraid of these martial masters, while some looked down on Zhou Chao. This guy was too useless. Did he spend all his energy on women?
         However, everyone's expression changed.
         Someone was coming!
         In the distance, sunguang, who was wearing the uniform of a night patrol, walked over with great dignity. As he walked, he said indifferently,""What are you all doing? Chen Jin, are you still not stopping? You're all night patrollers, are you going to kill people here and make a fool of yourselves?"
         Chen Jin and the others were absolutely furious!
         Bastard!
         It's this Zhou Chao who wants to break out of prison. He's a sinner, and you guys are actually shielding him so openly?
         Xie Lan transmitted his voice to the others. He was anxious and angry."Retreat ... This person has killing intent. He wants to kill us!"
         The rising light!
         It was difficult for a few of them to fight against a peak three-Sun Warrior. If it wasn't for the fact that the other party was too weak, they might not have been able to suppress him. However, when Xu Guang came, no matter how weak he was, he was not someone they could match.
         Chen Jin sent a furious mental message,"retreat, your mother!" If I don't ... I'll wait for him to kill me!"
         He was too aggrieved!
         This was the night patrollers 'headquarters. They were the law enforcers, while the other party was the one who had broken the law and resisted the law.
         He actually wanted them to retreat here?
         No retreat!
         Seeing this, Xie Lan and the others didn't say anything else. They attacked one after another, increasing their damage output. The rumbling sounds continued. They wanted to kill Zhou Chao before the other party could react!
         It was not a loss to kill one!
         "Bastards, I told you to stop, didn't you hear me?"
         Behind them, Xu Guang's eyes turned sharp and he quickly broke through the air."These martial masters are really crazy. I told you to back off, but these few Qian Dynasty Warriors didn't even care about Xu Guang."
         The next moment, a huge hand slapped toward them!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Chen Jin and the others could already sense the danger of death and the explosion of energy ... But they still didn't care. They wanted to kill!
         The other Wei Wu Army soldiers all shouted when they saw this!
         His qi and blood exploded. In an instant, hundreds of Wei Wu Army soldiers formed a formation and flew towards Xu Guang!
         This scene stunned many people.
          Was he crazy?
         A group of beings at the Dark Moon realm was going to kill a ... Sunguang?
         In the middle, there was the sunshine and three suns.
         There was a difference of two major realms and seven or eight minor realms. Did they really think that they were powerful just because they had more people?
         "You don't know what's good for you!"
         This Sunglow expert sent a palm strike towards the Wei Wu Army. Since they didn't want to live, then they should all die.
         As for hou Xiaochen ... There would naturally be someone to deal with him.
         In the distance, a flash of spear light flickered.
         In the end, hou Xiaochen still chose to attack.
         As for Huang Long and the others, their auras also exploded instantly. In an instant, the entire Nightwalker headquarters was filled with a towering pressure, as if the entire headquarters was going to explode.
        
         At this moment, a figure broke through the air and arrived.
         The speed was extremely fast.
         The Windchaser's boots flickered with light, and in the next second, the person landed in front of the rising light expert who had attacked. The rising light expert was startled and somewhat afraid, but he immediately said,"Li ..."
         Bang! Bang!
         One punch!
         With a simple punch, the five Forces exploded, and with a boom, his head exploded!
         He turned around and threw a punch. BOOM!
         Zhou Chao exploded into pieces.
         In the distance, Deputy Minister Zhou was stunned. The next moment, he roared,""Li Hao!"
         Huang Long was also shocked and extremely furious,"You dare to kill a night patroller, an advanced city patroller!"
          Li Hao looked at them coldly and ignored them. He turned to mu Xiaorong and the others and said coldly,""Come, take a step out. Take a step out of the courtyard. Show me your courage!"
         Silence.
         He retreated.
         Fear!
         At this moment, mu Xiaorong and the others felt a chill in their hearts.
         Li Hao ... Had returned.
         He didn't run!
         Li Hao turned his head and looked at Deputy Minister Zhou, who was charging at him madly. He had a mocking look in his eyes. He also looked at Huang Long with a mocking look.
         Huang Long instantly sobered up!
         "Retreat ... Quick, this guy is going to die. Don't fight him head-on. He's back, and he'll die tomorrow ... Quick!"
         Deputy Minister Zhou was filled with anger. The next moment, he felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on his heart. His heart turned cold.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Right.
         Li Hao's return means that he hasn't given up. He's dead for sure ... Now, he's provoking me to kill him ... If I go, I'll definitely die.
         In an instant, he woke up.
         He stopped in his tracks instantly, his eyes filled with resentment.
         Li Hao laughed. He looked at him, then at Huang Long and the others, and said with a faint smile,"A bunch of trash! I'm disgusted by the night patrols with you bunch of trash! I've given you the courage, but you don't dare to take a step forward ... Zhou, Huang, I went out for a walk, and you've become much bolder. What, you think you're so great just because you have a few more Metamorphoses?"
         Li Hao mocked,"all of you!" If you dare to make a move, I'll make sure none of you can leave this place alive!"
         "Hmph!"
         A cold sneer with contempt, and the other secretaries were silent.
         They dared to attack hou Xiaochen ... But didn't dare to attack Li Hao. It was truly strange and laughable.
         However, that was the truth.
         They knew that hou Xiaochen was powerful, but they weren't that afraid. They knew that Li Hao might not be able to defeat hou Xiaochen, but ... They were afraid of this lunatic!
         Besides, Li Hao was going to die tomorrow.
         To fall out with him at this moment was just asking for it.
         Li Hao's voice resounded in all directions."Today is the last day. If the list of 100 people doesn't come out tonight, I'll cut down 1000 people. I'll choose one out of the four!" Don't count on those trash outside. Whether it's a Yellow Dragon or a yellow worm, if he dares to come near here, I'll send him on his way first!"
         Li Hao's voice was cold and unreserved!
         In the next moment, he transmitted a message to Yao si who was peeking from afar: "Write me a document. Huang Long is colluding with the three major organizations. I'm going to kill him tomorrow to establish my might!"
         Yao Si was startled.
         He looked at Li Hao without saying anything.
         "If you're still Yao si, write me a letter ... If you don 't, I'll kill you too tomorrow!"
         “……”
         Yao Si was completely dazed, somewhat unable to believe it.
         Li Hao ... What did he say?
         At this moment, no one in the surroundings heard Li Hao and Yao SI's voice transmission. Instead, they heard Li Hao's arrogant voice as he looked down at Huang Long.
         At that moment, Xiao Ye clenched her fists, and her eyes suddenly flickered!
         He's back!
         He didn't run!
         However, in the next moment, it turned into worry and unwillingness ... You should have run. You're too stupid, too stupid!
         Even if they ran away, even if they were laughed at, it was better than sending themselves to death tomorrow.
         Li Hao ignored everyone and said,""Tomorrow at 10 am, at the north gate of the stellarsky city, I, li, will kill some people. Don't watch the commotion anymore. Tomorrow, I'll have someone project it to you ... Residents nearby, move away. I'm afraid that the blood of the aristocrats will dirty your land!"
         In an instant, stellarsky city fell silent.
         In the next moment, there was a clamor.
         "He's back!"
         "The northern barbarians are so brave. Damn it, I thought they really ran away ... They actually came back ..."
         "F * ck! This northern barbarian ... He's so F * cking strong!"
         "Hahaha, awesome. This is a slap in the face. Let's see what those bastards in the city who said he ran away can say."
         "Laugh, laugh my ass! He's just sending himself to his death by coming back!"
          "Give it to your mother and I'll cut off your head!"  "You dare to scold me?"
         "I still want to Cut You Down! If the northern barbarians kill a noble tomorrow, I'll kill you, the Noble's Lackey!"
         "You ... You're crazy!"
         "Better than you, Lackey!"
         “……”
         In an instant, the city was in an uproar.
         In an instant, all the nobles fell silent.
         The people who had been clamoring for Li Hao to run all fell silent. They knew that this was Li Hao's final madness before his death. If he didn't run, then no matter what they said now, they would be killed for nothing.
         Both sides were waiting for tomorrow.
         ……
         At the night patrollers 'headquarters.
         Mu Xiaorong and the others retreated one after another, and no one made any more noise.
         In the distance, Huang Long's expression was ugly, and Deputy Minister Zhou's face was ashen.
         As for Li Hao, he wiped his hands and looked at the Nightwatchers around him, whose eyes were flickering. He laughed and said,""What are you looking at? Scattered! If you look again ... I'll treat you as Huanglong's lackeys and send you on your way, how about it?"
         In an instant, everyone around them disappeared, including the Deputy Ministers.
         "Governor!"
         Chen Jin and the others were wild with joy!
         At this moment, the few of them were ecstatic. Governor li was still the best. The moment he arrived, he killed people. He killed Xu Guang, the son of the Minister, and most importantly ... The other party didn't even let out a fart.
         In front of his own father, he blew up Zhou Chao with a single punch!
         The governor was still the strongest and unparalleled!
         At this moment, they felt that the department head ... Was a little ... A little hesitant. Of course, they could understand the department head's difficulties, but they still felt great!
         Li Hao smiled and sent a voice transmission to everyone."What's the hurry? we'll see tomorrow ... Tomorrow, I'll beat Huang Long to death for you to see what a Martial Master is and what it means to be full of courage!"
         He would let it go today. Killing the yellow Dragon would more or less expose some things. After all, it was a transformation.
         The crowd was instantly pumped up. The next moment, they all shouted,""The military governor is mighty!"
         In the distance, hou Xiaochen laughed bitterly.
         He glanced at chief Yu, who was also waving his arms vigorously, as if he was very excited.
         Hou Xiaochen sighed ... Yu Luosha was almost 50 years old!
         What are you doing?
         The entire Nightwalker headquarters was instantly filled with the Wei Wu Army's furious roars.
         They knew that the military governor was Li Hao.
         At this moment, some of the night patrolmen also secretly waved their arms. They were secretly excited and fanatical. Good kill!
         Zhou Chao, this devil, was dead!
         It was a pity ... A pity ... That his father, Governor li, wasn't killed ... What a pity!
         There was also Huang Long ... Of course, they all understood that it was too difficult.
         For a moment, they were excited, emotional, and worried ... Governor li shouldn't have returned. If he did, he wouldn't be able to escape.
         ……
         Outside.
         Li Hao revealed a smile and looked at the group of people silently retreating in the distance. His smile was brilliant, and then he looked at Yao SI's head in the distance and smiled. "I'm waiting for the Minister's document ... I'm a night patrol, a law-enforcement officer, and I won't kill the innocent! Oh right ... It's best if you Give Me The Night patrolman's official seal. Whoever I want to kill, I can just stamp it!"
         “……”
         Yao Si was silent. He didn't speak and closed the window.
         Are you crazy?
         Completely crazy for once?
         After closing the window, she suddenly smiled and looked at Xiao Ye. After a while, she said,""Li Hao asked me to deliver the official seal to him ... To seal a murder. Do you think ... I should deliver it?"
         Xiao Ye was stunned. After a long while, she stammered,""I don't know ..."
         "Then you can send it over!"
         A myriad of thoughts rose in Xiao Ye's mind ... The next moment, an official seal appeared in her hand. It was the symbol of the night patrolman's legitimacy.
          Xiao Ye's mind wandered for a moment. The next moment, she suddenly kept the official seal, turned around, and ran.
         She ... Was going to send it over to Governor li!
         She didn't care what the Minister was thinking, but she knew that with this official seal ... Perhaps ... It would be more convenient for Governor li.
         ……
         Li Hao had returned!
         This news swept the entire city in the blink of an eye. The nine divisions and the imperial family fell silent.
         The news spread quickly. He killed Zhou Chao, Xu Guang, and Li Hao ... He had gone completely mad, the madness before his death, the madness of disbelief.
         He had even killed the night patrolmen, what more the others?
         At this moment, everyone made a decision. They would give Li Hao the name list first in case he really killed them all. They would give him the name list and see if he could kill them!
         So what if he gave it?
        
         (Keep it, this chapter is foreshadowing, don't urge, don't scold, what a pitiful old Eagle)
         Li Hao had returned.
         When this young man, who had just arrived in stellarsky city a few days ago, suddenly escaped from the rumors and returned, it seemed as if something had been ignited in an instant.
         ,m The numb people seemed to be ... A little excited.  They did not know what they were so excited about.
         They didn't know what kind of result they wanted. To kill a noble?
         He did not know.
         They were angry, hateful, and a little numb to the nobles. The nobles were the heavens, and so were the strong.
         In fact, they were not very interested in the battle between powerhouses. At most, they would just listen to it as some gossip.
         But today, for some reason, she just wanted to be happy.
          They didn't read much, and they didn't know how to read much. But at this moment, they were a little happy, a little excited, a little happy, and a little ... So excited that they couldn't sleep.
         Even in the capital, at the roots of the Imperial City.
         Out of the tens of millions of people, not many of them were actually literate. It was still okay when the schools were first opened, but after the rise of superpowers 20 years ago, a large number of schools were shut down. Five years ago, another large number of schools were shut down. Now, there were not many new generations receiving education.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Why was he happy?
         ……
         In the slums.
         The north wind blew. In the spacious courtyard, there were not many decorations. The windows were slightly leaking, and the cold wind whistled in.
         In the middle of the yard, a bonfire was lit.
         Dozens of children were gathered in a circle.
         Yuming, who was short and thin, nodded like an old scholar,""You don't know why everyone is so happy, right? When I went out to buy a sweet potato today, the wet nurse who sold sweet potatoes gave me an extra sweet potato. I don't know why she was in a good mood ... But she still gave me an extra one!"
         "Yes, yes. Liu Pozi from next door gave me a candy just now. He wouldn't have given it to me in the past!"
         "Yes, I'm pulling a cart for a customer today. He used to give me fifty cents at most, but he gave me one Yuan today!"
         “……”
         The children seemed to be very excited. They didn't know why it was like this, but many people seemed very happy today. It even felt like the new year was coming.
         Why?
         It's good to be like this every day.
         Yuming nodded and shook his head,"this is called awakening!" The awakening of the subconscious!"
         The child spoke in a very mature manner, like an adult."We know that our lives aren't very good, but why is it like this? "We live in the roots of the Imperial City. There are many rich people here. There are opportunities, money, and wealth everywhere ... But why do we still not live well? Are you living like a dead person?"
         "I know!" One of the children quickly replied. Because we are not nobles!"
          "I know, we have to become god tier Masters!"  "The heavenly priests aren't as powerful as you!"
         A child retorted,"I saw it last time. Ah Shan from the next street. He's already a God-blessed priest, but he's now driving a car and leading a horse for a noble!" If I were a noble, even if you were a priest blessed by the heavens, you would still have to hold the horse for me!"
         "I won 't! I want to learn the demonic sword and kill you!"
         "Don't you dare!"
         "I dare!"
         “……”
         The children's argument interrupted Yuming.
         Yuming sighed, but he wasn't angry. Instead, he smiled. Beside him, Yuqi handed him a roasted sweet potato. "You're not allowed to buy it next time. It's very expensive to roast it. We can roast it ourselves. Why are you wasting money?"
         Yuqi was very angry!
         Yuming quickly nodded, but then whispered,"The wet nurse who sells sweet potatoes is very pitiful. It's almost winter and the wind is cold. She can't sell many a day. She still has two grandsons to take care of. Her son went on a business trip two years ago and was involved in a superpower war. He died outside. His wife ran away too. She has to rely on selling sweet potatoes to support her family."
         Yuqi looked unhappy, but after hearing his words, she thought for a while and said,"But you're not allowed to buy it every day ... Three days ... Once every three days!"
         "Tomorrow ... Tomorrow," he suddenly added,"if Governor li kills ... Kills those people, you can go buy them!"
         Yuming smiled and nodded.
         "Sister, you've studied, do you know why everyone is so happy?" she whispered.
         "How would I know?" Yuqi rolled her eyes.
         Even though he said that, the next moment, he was a little happy.""Because someone dared to kill them! Sentence them! They oppress the civilians, they want to block our way forward and not give us hope ... Now, someone is breaking this class and breaking their monopoly ..."
         At this point, he stopped.
         She looked at her brother and sighed."Actually ... I know there's no hope. It's just the beginning. But ... It's worth being happy about. He didn't run away, did he?"
          Yuming nodded and said softly,"I didn't run ... I'm going to die."
         Yuqi's body stiffened.
         At this moment, tears welled up in her eyes unconsciously. She was going to die if she didn't run.
         These words suddenly made her feel like there was a lump in her throat, making her feel unspeakable sadness.
         He seemed to see blood all over the ground.
         He seemed to see Li Hao's corpse being hung high up, and he seemed to see his eyes full of sorrow ...
         Yuqi shook her head hard, then suddenly smacked Yuming's head!
         "Don't talk nonsense!"
         The voice was a little sharp, and the children around them were so scared that they looked over.
         Yuqi hit Yu Ming so hard that he covered his head and didn't dare to make a sound. When the others looked over, Yuqi said fiercely,""What are you looking at? if you continue looking, we'll fight together!"
        
         No one said a word.
         The children thought that their voices were so soft that Yuqi couldn't hear them, and someone whispered,""Sister Yuqi is so fierce, she looks like a noble!"
         "Nonsense, how can a noble live with us ..."
         "That's true!"
         “……”
         Yuqi didn't say anything more, but she touched her brother's head and complained,""You're not allowed to jinx me next time!"
         Yuming nodded quickly. She was slapped by her sister, so she didn't dare to say anything more.
         Yuqi rubbed her brother's head while looking in a certain direction. He ... Wouldn't die tomorrow, would he?
         She didn't know who to ask and just thought to herself.
         ……
          At the night patrollers 'headquarters.
         Li Hao didn't care about what others thought. He wasn't so noble or great now. Everything he had done these days was for his heart, for his martial arts, and for the injustice.
         Rescue?
         Li Hao didn't consider it for the time being, because he knew that it was too far and too difficult.
         He was only a warrior.
         He couldn't create a new era. He couldn't do many things. The only thing he could do was to raise this sword and cut off all the injustice. Even if ... The spring breeze blew and new things grew, the next time might be even more excessive.
         No one knew what Li Hao really wanted to do, because even Li Hao himself couldn't say it.
         However, the blood of the pugilistic world had yet to turn cold!
         I'm a Martial Master, I'm a man of the martial world. When I see injustice, someone will take it.
         If others can't do it, if they can't shovel it, let me do it!
         Right now, he was facing hou Xiaochen.
         Chief Yu sat at the side and listened quietly, as if she was witnessing something. At this moment, she was very solemn, and she also felt very sacred ... It was the feeling of the handover of the leader of the martial arts world.
         However, Li Hao and hou Xiaochen didn't have such thoughts.
         Li Hao took out the official seal that Xiao Ye had just delivered. Xiao Ye was very excited, but Li Hao didn't say anything.
         He took out the official seal and placed it in front of hou Xiaochen.
         Hou Xiaochen simply looked at Li Hao. He wanted to know ... What Li Hao was trying to say.
         "Tomorrow, the Marquis's tribe, do not attack!"
         Hou Xiaochen's expression changed slightly.
         Li Hao said calmly,"of course, if there's a chance, then attack!" If it can't be done, I, Li Hao ... Can't do it, can't kill them all, and can't do anything ... What's the difference if a few more people die?"
         "The Wei Wu Army is still in the city, so if there's no hope and there are too many powerful enemies, the Minister will go into hiding. When we return to Silver Moon, this day will come sooner or later!"
         Hou Xiaochen silently picked up his teacup and sipped his tea.
         Li Hao looked straight at him."I owe the Minister a favor, and I don't want to owe him any more. I can't pay you back. It's hard to pay back a favor." I'm doing all this because I'm a pugilist, not the Minister! If you want to be a good official, then be a good one. The people of Jianghu have their own ways. My master said,"Martial Master of Jianghu, if you don't listen to me, I'll kill you!" Being an official shouldn't be like this!"
         Hou Xiaochen remained silent.
          "This is the order of the night patrol!" Li Hao picked up the official seal.  "You're quite an interesting person,"hou Xiaochen chuckled.
         "It's not interesting. "
         Li Hao also laughed."However, there are still 1000 people in the Wei Wu Army. They are all Silver Moon martial masters. They are too weak. If they can't do it, why do they have to die?" If you have the heart, we'll fight again another day. Martial masters won't die as long as the martial world is not destroyed!"
         Hou Xiaochen laughed.
         He looked at Li Hao for a long time."When do you think there will be hope?"
         "I've really beheaded those people and hung their heads on the city gate. Their divine powers are afraid of me, and the nine divisions should avoid me ... The Minister can come and fight me!"
         "You ... At that time, wouldn't I be out of the picture?"
         "It's hard to say,"
         Hou Xiaochen laughed as he looked at Ling Chen. He furrowed his brows as if he was thinking about something. After a long while, he asked,"You ... Your body ... Has a different feeling and some changes ... Why?"
         "You've improved?"
         He asked again, still a little confused. Li Hao gave him a special feeling, like a thunderstorm or a storm.
         It was a feeling that was hard to describe.
         At this moment, Li Hao was still wearing his armor.
         Hearing this, he laughed,"Minister, you have a good eye. If I hadn't improved at all, would I be so arrogant?" Strength is the foundation of a Martial Master!"
         Hou Xiaochen said thoughtfully.
         He looked at Li Hao a few more times, thought for a moment, and said,""Don't absorb too much from the divine power Stone. It's not a good thing if you don't digest it."
         There was a vague feeling of divine power leaking out of Li Hao.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He felt it.
         However, he didn't think deeper into it.
         There was no other way.
         At Li Hao's level, he wouldn't try to break the superpower lock. He had a bright future ahead of him. It could be said that Li Hao was the first Martial Master in the world to reach the divine power level.
         He didn't need a transition period or a recovery period. He was a transcendent Martial Master in the true sense.
          How could a Martial Master like this destroy his own future?
         Moreover, he didn't feel any strong power of the five elements, so he didn't think too much about it.
         He thought that Li Hao was too eager for success and had absorbed too many divine power stones, which resulted in the accumulation of divine power.
         Li Hao laughed and nodded. I'm not stupid. When the time comes, I'll run. If I run, they won't be able to catch me easily. I still have the wind-chasing boots. "
         "Alright," he said.
         Hou Xiaochen nodded his head. As for what he was thinking, only he knew.
         I'll go to the backyard and see if the list of nobles is out.
         Li Hao stood up and left with the official seal.
         After he left, Chief Steward Yu looked at him a few more times. Hou Xiaochen chuckled, "You're still looking?"
         Chief Steward Yu was slightly embarrassed, but he quickly recovered."Head, Li Hao said ... Then ... Tomorrow ..."
        
         "I will weigh it."
         "He says what he wants, and I'll do what I want to do," hou Xiaochen replied softly. "The Wei Wu Army will have their own arrangements, so don't worry."
         "Yes."
         Hou Xiaochen pondered for a moment before saying,"I'm afraid he's too eager for success. Yuan Shuo's path of spiritual accumulation and spiritual fusion might not be complete. Li Hao seems to be leaking divine power. This isn't a good sign. It means that he's accumulated too much divine power and can't digest it."
         Chief Steward Yu's expression suddenly changed, and he said carefully,""Did he ... Break the superpower lock?"
         Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment before shaking his head,"that's not necessary." Unless all six of them were broken, it would not be of much help to him. On the contrary, it would devour his inner strength and he would lose control! I don't feel the power of the five elements, but I do feel a weak power of lightning. "
         "That's good!"
         Chief Steward Yu heaved a sigh of relief. That was good.
         Just as Li Hao said, he could still run away. There was no need to gamble everything in stellarsky city. If he really ran away to become a super, Chief Steward Yu would regret it to death.
         "Li Hao has the Windchaser's boots and the Li family's divine sword. The situation isn't good ... There should be hope for him to escape, right?"
          "There are."
         Hou Xiaochen nodded again. Even if he didn't have it, he had to have it. In reality, if Jiu si really wanted to deal with him, he would definitely have taken this into account.
         The wind-chasing boots could get rid of the transformation, but ... It couldn't get rid of the God art.
         Of course, there was no need to mention this.
         "Then I'll rest for the night. Don't just focus on having fun," hou Xiaochen said. "In the past, you'd always prepare a good meal the next day if you had something important to do. Why didn't you prepare anything tonight?"
         Steward Yu was stunned.
         That's right!
         I forgot about tonight!
         Li Hao has just returned and displayed his might. Although killing Xu Guang wasn't a big deal, and he could easily kill the Minister, I'm still a little happy that he's back ...
         Okay.
         She stood up."I'll do it, then. Minister, just wait for a moment!"
         "Go!"
         Hou Xiaochen nodded his head and waited for the banquet to begin.
         Chief Steward Yu wanted to say something, but she didn't in the end. Actually, she wanted to ask ... Should she make one for Li Hao?
         After some consideration, the Minister seemed to be a little off recently, so forget it.
         ……
         In the backyard.
         A large number of nobles were dispirited.
         Huang Long and the others had all gone into hiding, the Deputy secretaries had also run away, and Zhou Chao had been killed ...
         This was a huge blow to them.
         Especially since it was time to vote.
         100 people were selected!
         Although everyone felt that he wouldn't really die, didn't you see the opposition outside?
         But ... But what if he really died?
         Who wasn't afraid of death?
          "I don't agree with this way of voting!"  Someone shrieked,"this voting method is unfair!" I think we should vote in secret. Otherwise, there will definitely be people who are afraid of revenge. Miss mu, say something. Is it fair to vote in public?"
         They were going to vote now. In fact, the range of people selected for this name list was very small. Because the outside had prepared, they gave a list of 300 people.
         100 people, choose from these 300 people.
         People like mu Xiaorong were definitely not on this list. This was the list given out after some nobles outside had discussed it and compromised. Who would dare to choose the Secretary's daughter, mu Xiaorong?
         Now, they had to choose 100 people. The people outside were left to the people inside to decide.
         He consoled them that it was all the same.
         It was just a formality in name.
         He wouldn't let Li Hao succeed.
         But ... Who wouldn't be afraid of those on the list?
         Especially now, someone suggested that they choose on the spot, pick a name, and those who agreed to be selected raise their hands ... Wasn't this clearly offending people?
         Who would do such a thing?
         Of course, the stronger the family, the safer it would be. The weaker one would definitely be unlucky!
         Mu Xiaorong frowned slightly. She also felt that it wasn't good to make the choice public like this. It could easily cause some disputes. She nodded and said,""It's good to be anonymous. It's just a formality. You don't have to worry too much."
         The noble who had suggested this earlier also heaved a sigh of relief.
         Otherwise, a small figure like him would easily be on the list. Now, he was anonymous ... People might not even know his name. If he knew that he was a noble, perhaps ... Everyone would be happy to see all the more powerful people be selected!
         This was the reality!
         In public, no one dared to choose. Behind their backs, they wished that these people with more power and status would all die. Only mu Xiaorong and the others were not on the list. Otherwise, these great aristocrats would have the most votes.
         As they were talking, someone suddenly stiffened.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the next moment, people kept looking out and froze.
         Li Hao was here!
         Li Hao calmly walked in and looked at everyone."Is the list ready?"
         Mu Xiaorong's expression changed. She stood up and said,""We're almost there,"
         "Faster."
         Li Hao reached out and grabbed a person."Give me a copy of the list of 300 people you have!" I'll call out names on the spot and those who agree to be killed ... We'll see how many votes they get on the list. "
          "Governor li, we have made a decision internally ..." Mu Xiaorong's expression changed slightly.
         Li Hao looked at her."I have the final say. If you say one more word, you'll be on the list!"
         Mu Xiaorong frowned and didn't say anything more.
         In his heart, he thought,"it's just a formality, there's nothing to be afraid of."
         However, she still felt a little uneasy.
         The man caught by Li Hao didn't dare to speak. He hurriedly took out a list and handed it to Li Hao. Li Hao glanced at it.
         This name list was very interesting.
         After that, there were family clans, forces, titles, and positions.
         It was written clearly!
         Even clans were divided into powerful clans such as the rising sun clan and the three suns clan. Similarly, there were also subordinate clans. For example, the subordinates of the Liu Clan of the ninth Minister and the subordinates of the Chen clan of the ninth Minister ...
        
         The division was quite complicated.
         He scanned them from head to toe. There were three hundred people.
         There were strong and weak ones. The weak ones were only the descendants of a Centurion in the military law Department. The son of a Centurion also had the money to live freely on the four islands?
         Li Hao felt a little strange.
         A Centurion ... Was a very low rank.
         At least in today's era, they were not considered nobles. Without a title of nobility or real power, could they be considered nobles?
         A mere Centurion, his son could actually go to the four islands where money was spent like dirt.
         To be a servant?
         Looking around, Li Hao didn't seem to be satisfied. They were all marginal figures.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, he didn't say anything and said,""Where's the evidence?"
          Everyone looked at mu Xiaorong.
         Seeing Li Hao look at her, mu Xiaorong was a little nervous.""It's with me ... But I have to make a list first ..."
         "Give it to me!" Li Hao looked at her.
         Mu Xiaorong was a little afraid, but she still repeated,""We need to choose a list first. I'll give you the 100 people after I've confirmed them ..."
         "One!"
         "I ..."
         "Two!"
         The next moment, a thick document appeared in mu Xiaorong's hands.
         Li Hao reached out and grabbed it. Ignoring mu Xiaorong's angry gaze, he picked it up and looked at it.
         "Wu Yu, my father is Wu Hao. He's the Deputy Director of the 9th Division of the eastern Division, a subordinate of the five divisions, division of the administrative division ..."
         It was an introduction to his identity. Li Hao glanced at it and found it to be ordinary.
         Below were some criminal records.
         "Star origin calendar year 1721, Wu Yu once raped and killed a young girl. He was found dumping her body and killed the witness. After that, in the name of stealing secrets and colluding with the FEI Tian organization, he ordered people to arrest the young girl's parents who reported the case and put them in the prison of the criminal Division. Three months later, the husband and wife died in prison ..."
         Li Hao observed for a while. This Wu Yu seemed to have such a special fetish.
         The cases were all related to the young girl.
         Some people died, and some people were alive. Those who didn't say anything generally didn't die, but those who reported the case and came to find them all died. It wasn't just one or two, but their entire family was implicated.
         There were still reports in front, but behind ... No one reported any more.
         To report a case, one had to either go to the criminal law Division or the inspection Division.
         The result would be the same for both sides. It wouldn't be a big problem if you didn't report the case, but once there was a record ... Your entire family would be gone.
         He was just a Deputy Director of the First Division under the Division of Administration, division of five elements, and division of five elements. He was probably equivalent to a low-level City Patrol in the inspection Division. Li Hao had been a City Patrol for a long time, and so were Chen Jin and the others.
         Wu Yu's status wasn't high.
          That was his father's identity, and he himself was unemployed.  But ... Here, he seemed to be able to cover the sky with one hand!
         How interesting!
         Li Hao looked at them and smiled. His smile was cold.
         "Who's Wu Yu?"he looked at the crowd and smiled.
         In the crowd, a slightly thin, pale-faced young man, probably less than 30 years old, raised his hand nervously, looking very pitiful.
         "Governor li, it's me ..."
         "That's right!"Li Hao nodded and smiled.
         There was a record since 1721, and they had been doing this since nine years ago. At that time, they were about 20 years old.
         Wu Yu didn't know if this was a compliment or something else.
         Praise? that's impossible, right?
         Li Hao continued reading, ignoring them. He looked at them one by one. Wu Yu was not the most sinful. Compared to some people, it was like a junior meeting a senior.
         These people did not have high positions, but when they did evil, they seemed to be stronger than the previous one.
         A chiliarch of the military law Division had once led an Army of 1000 men to destroy a Chamber of Commerce that was said to be secretly supporting the three major organizations. He had killed everyone in the Chamber of Commerce, about 1000 people.
         But now, the information in his hands showed that he didn't collude with the three major organizations. The reason the Chamber of Commerce was destroyed was that the President of the Chamber of Commerce had accidentally obtained a yellow-grade origin divine weapon.
         However, the news somehow leaked out ... And then there was no' after '.
         After the incident, the captain did not keep the origin god weapon for himself but auctioned it instead. He handed over 70% of the money he had obtained and kept 30% for himself, so he was not punished.
         And this was actually recorded clearly.
         Li Hao was curious. Were these people crazy for providing the evidence and materials, or did they think that Li Hao didn't have the chance to see it, wouldn't see it, or wouldn't have the chance to leak it?
         "Where is Zheng Liang from the military law Division?"
         In the crowd, a middle-aged man raised his hand in a somewhat dignified but somewhat embarrassed manner.
          A thousand-man commander!
         In terms of strength, Li Hao took a look. Three suns initial stage. It seemed that the Army under his command was not an ordinary Army, but an elite one. Otherwise, it would be too rare for a chiliarch to have the strength of three suns.
         He was considered one of the high-level existences in the list of 300 people this time.
         "You're not bad either!"Li Hao smiled.
         Zheng Liang didn't say anything, but his eyes narrowed. He really wanted to know what was recorded on it.
         This was because this file had been given to only one person, mu Xiaorong.
         The others were not qualified to see it.
         Li Hao quickly finished reading the information. There were 300 people, but it was not a lot of information. There was only a brief introduction, and the details were not very clear. Each person had one page. His divine will was powerful, so he spent about half an hour to finish reading.
         Exhaling, Li Hao smiled and said,"I don't think 100 people will do. Just 300 will do. You don't have to choose, argue, or have disagreements. Anyway, it's just a formality. Li Hao might not be here tomorrow, right?"
         He laughed and looked at mu Xiaorong.""Why aren't these documents stamped with the official seal of the ninth Bureau?"
