        the demon race's bloodline was strong and their bodies were strong. If they were to fight, the ordinary three suns would not be their match.
         "I've neglected the Dragon envoy!"
         Xu Xing walked over with a smile. Black Panther glanced at him, and Li Hao did the same with his spiritual power. Xu Xing seemed to have sensed it. He was a little uncomfortable. He frowned, but soon relaxed.
         Were the demons so presumptuous?
         As for Li Hao, after sensing for a while, he also frowned slightly. Martial Master!
         It was not a superpower!
         It wasn't easy to judge his actual strength, but he was sure that he wasn't weak. From his qi and blood, and from his body, he might be a top-notch Martial Master. Of course, it was hard to say how top-notch he was.
         He only knew that power existed.
         "It doesn't feel as good as the southern style ... It ... It seems to be similar to the Golden spear?"
         Li Hao made a judgment in his heart, but he wasn't sure if it was true.
          This was the only trouble martial masters had. Unless they fought and revealed their strength, it was really difficult to judge the other party's strength.
         Of course, it was not completely impossible to detect. It was possible during the ancient civilization, but it required the help of some treasures or an extremely powerful divine will. Li Hao had obviously not reached that level yet.
         "You're a Martial Master?"
         Li Hao directly asked,"what strength?" Can you make the decision? You're the second young master ... Can you represent the high Duke's public house?"
         Even Xu Xing was a little stunned by this extremely direct question.
         However, he suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart and said with a smile,""Of course you can. Let's talk inside ... It's not very convenient to talk here."
         In his stomach, Li Hao patted the Black Panther. He stopped looking and followed it.
         The Black Panther was just a little curious and had smelled something delicious.
         At this moment, after being hit by Li Hao, he also withdrew his dog eyes and followed Xu Xing inside.

         At this moment.
         In the backyard of the high Duke's public house, Xu Qing and a few powerhouses were sitting in the main hall. They were looking at the projection in the main hall, which showed Black Panther, Xu Xing, and a few others.
         It was extremely clear!
          Not only that, a light spot appeared on the Black Panther's body. From everyone's experience, they knew that this was the symbol of the three yang.  Other than Xu Xing, the second-in-command and the rest of the supers behind him all had dots of light.
         Not only that, but even the ground seemed to be transparent, as if one could see through the ground and see everything underground.
         And this was only one part of it that was revealed.
         As they walked into the reception hall, the scene in the backyard kept changing. Anyone who appeared was a superpower and would show some special light spots.
         In the backyard, a bearded expert under Xu Qing couldn't help but exclaim even though he had seen it many times,""Duke, this treasure is truly godly! With this treasure, no one can escape the Duke's eyes!"
         After the bearded man finished speaking, an enchanting woman also smiled charmingly and said,""That's right, it's said that among the three high Duke's public houses, Duke dingguo's public house has the most lax security. Outside the door is the square, and people come and go ... They don't know that even if a mosquito enters the high Duke's public house, it can't escape the Duke's eyes. If those Rascals think that the high Duke's public house can enter and leave as they please, they're seeking death!"
         Xu Qing, on the other hand, was calm."It's just the wisdom of the ancients. It's a pity that only one set of equipment has been excavated over the years and can't be replicated. Otherwise, this item would be spread all over the East and the dynasties. Then, who in the world would be able to escape the net?"
         It was a good treasure, but unfortunately, there was only one.
         The area of coverage was not large, it could only cover the high Duke's public house. It was expensive and consumed a large number of divine power stones, but Xu Qing did not care. With this thing, he could eat and sleep better.
         Whoever wanted to sneak into the public house ... Would be caught red-handed if they had superpowers!
         When a Martial Master sneaked in, his energy would not be visible. However, when he sneaked in, the image could show people. It was not just energy. If an outsider entered, it would also instantly trigger an alarm.
         He did not say much about this. The few people in front of him were all trusted generals. It was not a big deal to know about this, and it could also make them more respectful. However, it was not appropriate to leak too much. This was the important reason why no one in the high Duke's public house had been able to find out anything for many years.
          Even though the light sword had been around for many years, he didn't know of its existence. After all, he knew that a Silver Moon Martial Master wouldn't be able to raise it well.
         "Duke, the lineage of Mount kui only sent one three yang lesser demon ... They're quite arrogant!"
         "The demon race doesn't understand these things, so there's no need to worry too much. I think this big demon has an extraordinary bloodline, but I don't know what kind it is. It looks like a dog ... And a Wolf. The snake Race of Mount kui is the most powerful, but a strange one has come ... I don't know what the situation is."
         “……”
         The few of them whispered to each other as they continued to observe. Even the sounds and fluctuations of the images began to spread out, allowing them to hear everything clearly.
         Just as he was speaking, the Golden David's deer said,""I'm here on behalf of the Dragon God of Mount kui. I won't beat around the bush with you humans. The Dragon God is about to advance, but he still lacks something ... I heard that you have the wind-chasing boots of the eight great clans ... The Dragon God asked me to borrow them for a period of time. Once the Dragon God has successfully transformed, I will definitely repay you handsomely!"
         Xu Xing didn't have much of a reaction to this, but the expressions of the powerhouses in the backyard changed.
         In the front hall.
         "You must be joking, emissary ..." Xu Xing immediately frowned.
         Li Hao immediately said,"who's joking?" Who had the time to joke? You might not be able to use that thing, and I heard that you lost one ... The rest are useless. Why don't you lend it to my Mount kui lineage? as long as you lend it, we'll be friends! Lord Dragon God said that if you lend us your treasures, we're friends. If you don 't, we're enemies!"
        
         Xu Xing immediately felt a headache.
         This demon was so direct and straightforward?
         Moreover, the first thing he asked for was the Windchaser's boots!
         That damned guy!
         This is troublesome!
         He felt a headache coming on. Li Hao said,""Don't think that we're lending you for free!"
         Li Hao's mental energy fluctuated violently."Lord Dragon God said to lend it to us. The lineage of Mount kui can dispatch five demon kings Sunglow to fight for you for a period of time. In addition, he's willing to pay five drops of the spring of life every year as the price for lending us the divine weapon!"
         After saying that, Li Hao waved his paw, and the Black Panther was stunned. You're controlling me?
         The next moment, a small bottle appeared!
          A drop of Green Spring water of life appeared. Xu Xing's expression changed slightly, and his eyes flickered. Li Hao was extremely bold."This is it. Have you humans seen it before? This was a treasure! It was obtained by the Lord Dragon God of Mount kui when he paid a visit to The Guardian of Mount kui ..."
         "Guardian?" Xu Xing's expression changed slightly.
         "You guys don't know?"
         Li Hao lied,"there's an Imperial Palace in the depths of Mount kui!" "In the Imperial Palace, the Lord Protector has been in charge for tens of thousands of years. He is immortal, undying, and indestructible. His power can connect with the gods, his origin opened the path, and he condensed the lake of life. Only then can the glory of Mount kui be forged. If it wasn't for the fact that the protector needed to guard the Imperial Palace and couldn't leave Mount kui, your mere High Duke's public house could be destroyed with a flick of a finger!"
         Xu Xing was still at a loss.
         In the backyard, Xu Qing instantly crushed the wooden chair's armrest. His expression changed slightly, and he was a little shocked."Imperial Palace, Guardian monster plant, lake of life, great Dao of origin ..."
         He was shocked!
         "Kuishan ... Was the training hall of a venerable sovereign in the past?" he was in disbelief.
         His subordinates were a little confused, but Xu Qing was extremely shocked.""It's said that in the ancient civilization, there were Supreme Masters, human Kings, and some Supreme Masters were called venerable sovereigns ... They were unimaginable existences, extremely powerful, and easily destroyed stars ... Their temporary residences were called imperial palaces, and they were usually guarded by monster plants ... Monster plants are great monsters that turn trees into spirits and can create springs of life. The so-called origin is the great Dao that directly points to the essence of martial arts. It's hard to guess how strong they are, but those involved are all top masters. At least ... He's an existence that I can't match even if I break the sixth lock ..."
         "Moreover, it's an existence that has lived for tens of thousands of years ... Unbelievable!"
         His subordinates were also shocked. They looked at each other in disbelief."Duke, the ancient civilization ... Really had experts that survived? What kind of terrifying existence can live for tens of thousands of years?"
         "I'm not sure ..."
         Xu Qing shook his head and was also extremely solemn.""I had thought that Mount kui was only powerful because of the snake tribe, but I didn't expect ... If what this demon said was true, Mount kui is much more terrifying than Mount heavenly Peng and Mount Phoenix!"  "It's just that ... The other party actually wants the wind-chasing boots ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He frowned. Was the wind-chasing boots related to the other party's transformation?
         At this thought, he took out his communication Jade and quickly sent Xu Xing a message.
         ……
         In the front hall.
         Xu Xing looked at the message without a change in his expression and quickly said,""Emissary, forgive me for being presumptuous, but why would senior Dragon God need the high Duke's public house's heirloom for his transformation and advancement?"
         "You don't even understand this?"
         Li Hao was furious."I don't want any ultimate treasures. I want the origin aura in the ancient divine weapons. These ancient divine weapons are made from the corpses of powerful demonic plants and demonic beasts. The more powerful the divine weapon is, the more powerful the ancient demon created will be!" It's said that these wind-chasing boots have a cold aura, which is in line with my Lord Dragon God's ancient martial origin Dao. What the Dragon God wants is not some broken weapon, but the origin aura within it ... When his comprehension advances, these wind-chasing boots will be useless ... They won't be given to us, so they'll naturally return them to you!"
         "Then ... Will it affect the wind-chasing boots?"
         "Of course I won 't!"
         Li Hao said,"the aura of the origin is different from today's martial arts and superpowers. You're not going down that path. Besides, this is the origin of the demon race, which is even more unsuitable for you. Even if you extract the origin, it won't be a loss for you ... You might not understand, but Lord Dragon God said that if you don't understand, you can ask someone who does. It's obvious that you're inexperienced!"
         After he finished speaking, he continued,"there's another one. It's said that it was taken away?" What trash! Lend this one to the Dragon God. The Dragon God promised that once it successfully advances, it will go and kill that whatever sword ... After killing it, it will extract the origin aura from The Other Wind chasing boots. The remaining one will be given to you as a benefit!"
          Xu Xing's expression changed slightly when he heard this.
         ……
         In the backyard.
         The eyes of Xu Qing and the others also flickered.
         If he lent it to the great snake, the great snake would take the initiative to look for the light sword once it advanced?
         This way ...
         Xu Qing quickly sent a message to Xu Xing.
         "But the light sword is in the land of the Silver Moon ..." Xu Xing immediately said.
         "Of course, the Dragon God is aware of that. That's why he wants to advance before going. The so-called Silver Moon Martial Master isn't scary, I, kui mountain, fear nothing! What's more terrifying is the existences buried under the silver moon ... That's what I, kui Shan, fear. If the Dragon God doesn't successfully advance and become a Divine Dragon, he wouldn't dare to rashly head there. "The Silver Moon is the core of the new martial era. The eight ancient cities protect the Silver Moon. The eight Guardian monster plants are extremely powerful. There might still be some surviving existences. It is said that the forbidden Sea has poured into the Silver Moon, and there are also great monsters in the ancient sea ... If my Mount kui wants to unify the four Seas, we will need help ..."
        
         In any case, Li Hao was bragging to death at this moment!
         Believe it or not.
         He was also using all sorts of ancient terms. Those who understood understood understood, but those who did not ... There was nothing they could do. There must be someone in the high Duke's public house who understood, so it was impossible for them not to understand.
         It would be best if he could directly get the wind chasing boots!
         Even if he couldn't deceive them, he had to make them believe that he was the real emissary, that he knew many secrets, that Mount kui had a great background ...
         When the time came, if it really didn't work, he could just say that he borrowed it to look at it and admire it.
         The main thing was that Li Hao was afraid that the Xu family would use fake wind-chasing boots to deceive people when they returned to pay their respects. That wouldn't be good, and it would be a waste to take them.
         ……
         Li Hao's words had indeed shocked Xu Qing and the others.
         Even the old and astute Xu Qing was extremely solemn at this moment.
          It seemed as though the great snake of Mount kui knew many secrets. It even knew of the lesser demons under its command. It seemed ... That the existence of the Imperial Palace was very likely true.
         And what the other party meant was that he still wanted to unify the four Seas?
         This ambition ... Was not small!
         Xu Qing frowned and felt a headache. If it was true, this kui Shan could not be offended, and could not be offended. However, there was only one wind chasing boots left. He said he was lending it, but once it was lent out, could he get it back?
         But if he didn't ... Then it would be troublesome. If he had offended the lineage of Mount kui, if he had understood the situation earlier, it wasn't that he couldn't afford to offend them.
         But now, he really couldn't afford to offend them!
         At this moment, the communication Jade in his hand vibrated slightly, and a line of words appeared on it. "Sir, I have arrived at Mount kui. After a few twists and turns, I met the Snake King of Mount kui and asked about the envoy. The Snake King only said that he was a descendant of an ancient demon and had a noble status. He said nothing else and expelled me from the mountain ..."
         Xu Qing was stunned for a moment. What did this mean?
         Descendants of ancient demons?
         He didn't mention anything else. Was he denying, admitting, or disdaining to answer?
         At this moment, he was also a little confused, but he was clear about the identity of this Golden Demon. The descendant of an ancient demon had a noble identity. Even this snake said that his identity was noble ... Could it be ... Could it be the descendant of the great demon in the Imperial Palace that the Golden Demon mentioned?
         In the Imperial Palace, could there be ancient Fey living besides Fey plants?
         Thinking of this, Xu Qing was shocked.
         How many secrets were hidden in this Mount kui?
         ……
         At the same time.
         In Mount kui, the giant snake watched as the human cultivator left. It was a little suspicious, but it was intelligent. It seemed to have realized something and quickly ignored him. This King did not say anything.
         He didn't acknowledge any emissary.....If he dares to find trouble with this King after this, this King isn't to be trifled with!
         The descendants of ancient Fey had a noble status and were not fake at all.
         Every word it said was true, and it had already given him enough face.
         As the Demon King of Mount kui, he had given them so much face. Even if these people were dissatisfied afterward and dared to come to Mount kui to find trouble, he would not be polite.
         "What does that young man from heaven battling city want to do?"
         The Python thought to itself, but it didn't care anymore. Since he said it was military affairs, it didn't care anymore.
         Previously, he said that he would help to stop the strong enemy ... Could he be talking about the Duke dingguo's mansion?
         As expected of an inheritance from an ancient family, he was really bold. The Duke dingguo's mansion was not to be trifled with. However, Mount kui was his territory, so he was not afraid of the Duke dingguo. If that person could help him transform into a Dragon ... He would be happy to attack the Duke dingguo's mansion directly.
         ……
         At this moment, Xu Qing fell into deep thought.
         If this big Golden Demon was a descendant of the ancient demon of the Imperial Palace, then he was really not someone to be trifled with.
         The Python could still be provoked.
         Ancient Fey ... Who knew if the ancient Fey was still alive or not? just how strong was he? to be able to live until now, that was terrifying to the point of being terrifying. He really couldn't afford to provoke him.
          He sent Xu Xing a message again.  "Emissary, pardon me for asking, but according to the Dragon God of Mount kui, you come from the ancient demon clan. I wonder if I'll have the honor of meeting your ancestors?" Xu Xing asked anxiously.
         Li Hao was shocked!
         I'll go!
         I've only been here for a short time, and you guys went to see the snake?
         At this moment, Li Hao's heart also turned cold ... But after listening carefully, it seemed that ... The Python didn't say anything and didn't expose him.
         The ancient demon clan ... So that's all the snake had said?
         This was frightening!
         At this moment, Li Hao was filled with fear. He also felt that he had been too careless. He had thought that Mount kui was very far away, but he did not expect the other party to send people over so quickly. He had also thought that if he disguised as a great demon, the other party would not be too suspicious. He did not expect that they would be so suspicious.
         Fortunately, the Python probably didn't expose him. Otherwise, the situation probably wouldn't be like this.
         However, in this case, the Python might be in some trouble after the matter.
         Thousands of thoughts quickly rose in Li Hao's mind, but he still bragged,""You think you're worthy? Besides, our ancestor is in a deep sleep and can't come out unless there's something major. The world might have changed ... Forget it, you won't understand even if I tell you. It's fine if you want to see him, but when you become an omnipotent expert, I can bring you to the Imperial Palace to see him. Do you dare to go?"
         Xu Xing was embarrassed, but he was sure of one thing. They were really from the Imperial Palace!
         Terrifying!
         It was no wonder that a trifling three yang lesser demon could become the envoy of Mount kui. It turned out that he had a great background.
         At this moment, he couldn't refuse or agree, so he could only say,""This matter is of great importance. Emissary, please be patient. I'll go and report this to my father ..."
         "So troublesome!"
         Li Hao said irritatedly,"humans are always dawdling. Or is it that you've actually lost a pair, not one? Don't try to lie to us demons ... If you really lose it, then just say that you shouldn't lie to us demons. Otherwise, the consequences aren't something you can bear! Let's not talk about lending it or not. When you get back, let this King have a look at the wind chasing boots and see if they're in your house. If they're not, then your family has no right to talk to this King ... It's a waste of this King's time!"
         "Also, I'm not sure if the Windchaser's boots are a treasure of the eight protector clans ... We'll talk about it when we see the real thing. If we can't see it, your Xu clan has deceived kui Shan. Just wait for my revenge!"
         “……”
         Xu Xing was completely speechless.
         Revenge?
         Who lied to you?
         "You guys came to me on your own accord. In the end, you guys started talking about revenge before we even started talking. As expected, demons are demons. They have no patience at all and no rationality at all.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com For no reason, he had almost provoked a group of demons. Xu Xing was also having a headache.
         He didn't say anything more. He hurriedly comforted Li Hao and asked the second-in-command to take Li Hao to the guest building to rest. Then, he ran to the backyard. He knew that his father had been paying attention to him, so he could only ask his father for his opinion.
         At this moment, Li Hao was also greatly frightened.
         He was still too young!
         The next time he did something like this, he had to think of all the details in advance. If the Python directly said that there was no emissary, he might be in big trouble.
         "You Must Remember This lesson ..."
          Li Hao thought to himself and began to consider whether he should go back and ask if there was any way to transform into a Dragon since the Orochi gang had helped him.
         In any case, he definitely did not have it.
         As for whether heaven battling city had it or not, he wasn't sure. He could also help ask little tree.
         "Wind chasing boots, at least show it to me ... At that time, I will have a chance to get the treasure!"
         While Li Hao was thinking about this, he realized that something was wrong with the high Duke's public house. In fact, he had felt that he was being watched since he came in. Xu Xing kept looking at his communication Jade and thought he didn't know him, but in fact, Li Hao did.
         So, could it be that Xu Qing had been secretly watching and monitoring?
         If that was the case ... It was a little scary. He didn't even see anyone.
         Of course, he saw some large orbs of light in the backyard. Perhaps Xu Qing was there. In that case, even if he was in the backyard, he could still monitor the front yard and even hear the sounds?
         "There must be a set of surveillance equipment in the high Duke's public house, and it's extremely powerful. I didn't even notice it ... Even here, I feel like I'm being monitored."
         Li Hao secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, he wasn't bold enough to sneak in. He had planned to dig a hole and come here, but he didn 't.
        
         Heibao was brought to the guest house to rest.
         The people in the backyard began to discuss.
         In fact, the Black Panther was not resting. As a demon, and a descendant of an ancient demon at that ... Li Hao felt that a dog that was resting obediently did not fit the image of an ancient demon. Whose great demon was so obedient?
         Therefore, right after the second-in-command left, Heibao came out in the open.
         He didn't hide anything and just walked out openly. He randomly stared at a servant in the residence and asked,""That weak little guy, come over and show this King around!"
         That posture, it was as if he would eat you if you dared not come!
         In the public house, the young servant was scared out of his wits. He did not dare to agree, but he also did not dare to refuse. Seeing the Black Panther baring its fangs as if it was going to eat someone, the servant was so scared that he almost peed his pants ... Just then, the second-in-command, who had just left, suddenly returned!
         Li Hao was even more certain that he was being watched.
         It came too quickly.
         He didn't emit any aura, and he didn't attack anyone. The other party would know what was going on as soon as he turned around. Li Hao would've chopped his head off if he hadn't been watched.
          "Messenger, don't you want to rest for a moment? Mount kui isn't far from here, and it's a long journey ..."
         "Do you think I'm a weak human like you?"
         Li Hao said again,"besides ... What kind of lousy place is this? it's so narrow. How can I rest?" Less nonsense, show me around ... You humans sure know how to enjoy life. A mere High Duke can afford such a large family business ..."
         The second general manager's face was twitching.
         This little demon was really impolite.
         He was at the rising light realm, after all, and this little demon was only at the third yang realm, yet he was so arrogant.
         Of course, he also knew that this demon's background wasn't small, and he didn't dare to provoke him easily. He could only deal with it,""What do you want to see, envoy?"
         Li Hao pondered for a while and said telepathically,""The Treasury!"
         "What?"
         Li Hao said impolitely,"treasure vault!" Let's see how your public house is doing. Was he worthy of working with kui Shan? Do you have the qualifications to join forces with me, kui Shan? "The Treasury is the foundation, the most basic energy stones, ancient divine weapons, and the spring of life. If we don't have enough of these things, how can we be considered a powerful force?"
         “……”
         The second general manager was somewhat dumbfounded.
         This was the first time he had met such an arrogant person ... A demon!
         No, I didn't know many demons before. Are all demons like this?
         So direct and straightforward?
         Are they all so unscrupulous?
         If this fellow didn't have any backing, he could kill it with a slap right now!
         He was too arrogant.
         Li Hao then asked,"what?" Are you afraid that this King will Rob you? The high Duke's public house is afraid of this Prince's Third Sun? Besides ... Do you think I'm interested in you?"
         With a sneer and disdain, Li Hao's claws moved, revealing a large jar. The jar was sealed, and no one could see what was inside. However, Li Hao casually poured out more than ten drops of the spring of life.
         "If you serve this King well, this King will reward you with a few drops to eat. This thing, this King has plenty!"
         The second general manager's expression changed!  When Li Hao had taken out a drop, he had been tempted. The demons were really rich.
         But now ... He wasn't just shaken, he was shocked. He was going crazy, and his killing intent rose up. He wanted to kill this Greater Demon and take the treasure.
         The heavens?
         What did I just see?
         He saw a large jar and more than ten drops of the spring of life that had been poured out casually. As the chief Steward of the high Duke's public house, he was considered a knowledgeable person and knew the value of the spring of life.
         One drop, one life!
         ……
         At the same time.
         In the backyard.
         The auras of the few supers exploded.
         Duke dingguo also crushed a second chair. Xu Xing, who had just arrived in front of them, also had his mouth wide open.
         "Duke!"
         The powerhouses 'expressions changed.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, there was killing intent, greed, and madness.
         It was a huge jar!
         It was very, very big!
         He casually poured out more than ten drops of the spring of life. How many were there in this jar?
         Heavens!
         How many lives?
         Not only that, even Xu Qing was thinking that with so much spring of life, could he directly strengthen his five internal organs to the limit and directly unseal his combat power, without the need to seal himself.
         "Sit down!" He suddenly shouted."Sit down!"
          The greed in his eyes turned into solemness the next moment."All of you, sit down! What, are you all crazy? Do you know what this amount of spring of life represents? It means that a great demon from the ancient civilization really survived, it means that the Imperial Palace really exists, it means that there's an extremely powerful legendary existence behind this little demon, it means that its identity is really extremely noble, it can even drink the spring of life like water ..."
         The more he spoke, the more scared he became. He gritted his teeth and said,""You're going crazy when you see treasures. Aren't you afraid that you'll be able to take your life but not be able to spend it? Or do you think that you can run away after taking the treasure while my Duke dingguo's mansion is here? in any case, only the people of the Duke dingguo's mansion will die?"
         As soon as he said this, the powerhouses 'expressions changed. They hurriedly suppressed their greed and bowed,""Duke, we know we were wrong!"
         "Hmph!"
         Duke dingguo snorted coldly. In fact, at that moment, his killing intent had been aroused. He really wanted to go out and kill that weak little demon without caring about anything.
         However, reason still prevailed.
         At this moment, there were no more doubts.
         This was a descendant of an ancient Fey with a powerful background and an extremely noble status. There might be more than one ancient Fey standing behind it, because the spring of life was not something that Fey beasts could form.
         How many bottles were there?
         That meant that there was definitely a demonic plant-type monster alive.
        
         The more he thought about it, the more he understood how terrifying it was.
         He furrowed his brows, but very quickly, he relaxed slightly and exhaled.""Good news! Mount kui is close to us, so the lineage of Mount kui came to us first. It seems they have the intention of working together. Things are different now, and just as Jin Yao said, the ancient demons of today may not be able to walk out easily, and may not be able to adapt to the current world. This makes sense. "
         "However, all of this is just speculation. If the other party really comes out, he'll be an existence that we can't match."
         After thinking for a while, he looked at his son."Go. Take it around. Take it wherever it wants to go."
         "Father, it's going to the Treasury ..." Xu Xing was shocked.
         "Bring it there!"
         Xu Qing said calmly,"to it, is the high Duke's public house's Treasury really a Treasury?" "Perhaps it's just a rare sight or a lively scene. I'm willing to exchange that jar of spring of life for the entire High Duke's public house ... I'm just afraid that it won't be willing! You can give it a try and ask it if it's willing to exchange for it. "
         Snatching by force was the stupidest decision.
         He wasn't a rogue cultivator, nor was he a rogue cultivator.
         He was the Overlord of the East, the Duke of dingguo. Once he snatched the little demon, he wouldn't be able to run away, unless he gave up on the family business. However, he wasn't happy about that. The Xu family had accumulated two hundred years of wealth. To give up for the spring of life ... Was impossible.
          Not only could he not snatch it, he had to protect it.
         Thinking of this, he looked at the few people present again and said in a low voice,""All of you are the pillars of my family. I don't want anything to disappoint me ... The spring of life is precious, but there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. If we form a complete alliance with the Mount kui lineage, I don't think we'll lack the spring of life. Everyone, don't give up the long-term benefits for the immediate benefits ... As long as we can reach an agreement, we can even have a small demon. I think ... The price won't be too great. "
         Everyone thought about it and agreed.
         "It's also because of the high Duke's prosperous destiny that the Mount kui lineage was moved by his name. That's why they were able to send the descendants of the ancient demons to discuss the Alliance,"someone immediately began to flatter.
         Xu Qing smiled and didn't say anything.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Naturally, he was proud of himself.
         However, there was still a problem.
         Wind-chasing boots!
         Yes, wind-chasing boots.
         What the other party wanted now was the wind-chasing boots, which was the most troublesome part for him. If he wanted anything else, he could choose anything. He really didn't need to consider cooperating with kui Shan and having the backing of an ancient existence.
         But ... The wind-chasing boots ...
         He was at a loss. He thought about the one that had been taken away and the one that was left now ... He was hesitant. These ancient existences all wanted the wind chasing boots. It seemed that the wind chasing boots were really amazing.
         However, he could not use it.  No matter how amazing it was, it couldn't be turned into combat power or benefits.
         Many thoughts appeared in his mind, but he still decided to wait. He looked at his son and said,""You go first. If it has any requests, try your best to satisfy it. If you mention the wind chasing boots again ... Just tell it that I will let it study it after I come out of seclusion ... But not now."
         "Alright, father, I'll be off then ..."
         Xu Xing didn't say much and quickly left.
         After he left, Xu Qing looked at the few people in the manor and took a deep breath.""We will first placate this Mount kui ancient Fey. Everyone, raise your spirits. The Grand ceremony will begin once the sky brightens. The main thing is to guard against those fellows. If you can't ..."
         He looked at the big Golden Demon in the picture and thought, should I make use of this little demon?
         Even though they had yet to come to an agreement, it was not impossible for them to intimidate everyone with the name of kui Shan.
         ……
         At the guest building.
         Li Hao made a fuss about going to the treasure vault, leaving the second general manager helpless. It was only when Xu Xing appeared that the second general manager felt relieved.
         As for Xu Xing, he was not in the mood to prepare for the ceremony. At this moment, there was only the big jar of spring water of life in his mind. When he saw black Panther, he hurriedly smiled."Where are you going, envoy?"
         "Your family's Treasury, your family's servant actually dared to refuse ..."
          "It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding! The emissary is a descendant of an ancient demon and has a noble status. It's just a treasure vault, what does it count as? Chief Steward Ming doesn't understand these things, so the emissary has misunderstood. "
         Xu Xing's face was full of smiles."I'm only bringing the messenger over for some insignificant things. It's an honor for the messenger to be interested."
         At this moment, Li Hao was hiding in the Black Panther's stomach and gloating.
         As expected!
         There was some risk, but to smart people and ambitious people, this was not considered a risk.
         If he had met someone like Southern Fist ... Li Hao wouldn't have dared to show off like this even if he was beaten to death. If he had been so ostentatious, he would've really, really died. Southern Fist would've definitely killed Black Panther and seized his treasure.
         As for how much trouble he would leave behind, what did it have to do with him?
         As for the fight between kui Shan and the royal family ... The southern Fist might even want to watch the show.
         Therefore, different methods were needed to deal with different people. On the Duke dingguo's side, Li Hao's method was clearly not bad. He would let the people of the southern Fist eat their fists!
         Li Hao chuckled. He did not hold back and continued to be as reckless as a demon. "That's true. What good things can you have here? But sometimes you don't recognize the treasure, and even if you dig it up, you might not know how to use it ... This King's greatest interest is to search for treasures, and sometimes this King knows what you don't know. Hahaha, at that time, it will be this King's luck ... This King has taken a fancy to it, so how about giving me a few?"
        
         "It's just a small matter. "
         Xu Xing smiled and nodded. His father had already said to try his best to satisfy this ancient Fey descendant. He naturally had no objections.
         Moreover, the items in the treasure vault were all of a lower grade.
         Why would the truly good things be placed in the treasure vault?
         Was the storage ring just a decoration?
         The Xu family's true treasures were all in his father's storage ring. Even he, Xu Xing, was not qualified to come into contact with them.
         Xu Xing didn't waste any time. He led the Black Panther and quickly walked toward the depths of the backyard. On the way, the Black Panther looked around. Li Hao also released his spiritual power without any restraint to explore the surroundings.
         Its arrogant attitude made it seem as if this was its territory.
         Xu Xing pretended he didn't see anything.
         So be it. Judging from the appearance of the descendant of an ancient demon, he did not seem to be here for intelligence. Instead, he seemed to be curious about his first time in the human world. In fact, Li Hao and the Black Panther were both very curious.
          While Li Hao explored, he said with mental waves,""Right, what's your name again?"
         Xu Xing was speechless, but he still spoke.
         "Oh, Little Star ... That's a good name!"
         "Little Xing, this place is not good ..." Li Hao complimented.
         What's the matter now?
         Xu Xing was speechless.
         Li Hao seemed to say it unintentionally."I've been feeling uncomfortable ever since I came here. I feel like I'm being watched. Is there an expert watching your family?"
         Xu Xing's heart trembled.
         He could even feel this?
         This little demon was worthy of being a descendant of an ancient demon. His senses were too sharp. One must know that many powerful sunrises had entered the high Duke's public house but did not feel anything.
         Xu Xing was a little embarrassed and didn't say much.
         It was hard to say. If he did, the little demon might get angry and feel that the high Duke's public house had offended it.
         Li Hao was just testing him. Seeing that he didn't say anything, he immediately understood. He had some speculations. After checking, he found that what was monitoring him might not be an ordinary item, but a divine weapon.
         Otherwise, it wouldn't be so well-hidden.
         This Duke dingguo had many treasures.
         As expected of a family with two hundred years of inheritance ... Well, in this era, two hundred years of inheritance was not a small number. It could indeed be considered a large family, or even an aristocratic family. No wonder Xu Feng was so arrogant that day, believing that Li Hao would not dare to kill him.
         After going around in circles, the group of people and a dog soon appeared under a huge Pavilion.
         "This is the Xu family's Treasury ..."
         After Xu Xing's introduction, Li Hao explored the Treasury again. The defense of the Treasury was decent, and there were two three suns guarding it in secret. The three suns were not weak. Under normal circumstances, if they were here, it meant that the high Duke's public house had been invaded.
         There was actually no difference between arranging three suns or sunguang.  "This Treasury is made entirely of the strongest steel. Ordinary transcendents will not be able to break through it easily ..."
         Xu Xing said a few more words, then walked to the door of the pavilion. He took out a key from his storage ring, and there was a large golden lock on the door of the pavilion."The Treasury is usually closed, and only my father and I can open it ..."
         "It's just scrap metal," Li Hao said indifferently."I can break it with one claw."
         Xu Xing laughed."It's naturally not difficult to break it by force. However, this is the high Duke's public house. It might not be as strong as the kuishan Imperial Palace, but it's still a heavily guarded place in the human world. Please don't laugh at me, envoy."
         With a creak, the lock was unlocked, and Xu Xing pushed the door open.
         The Black Panther's nose twitched, as if it had smelled something. It even felt like drooling. Li Hao hurriedly released his divine will to provoke the Black Panther. Don't embarrass yourself.
         Xu Xing, on the other hand, did not pay much attention to this. He led Black Panther in and said,"There are three levels in the treasure vault. To the messenger, it's not a good thing. The first level is where the divine power stones and mysterious energy are stored. There are 100 storage rings here, and they are all filled with divine power stones and mysterious energy ..."
         Yes, there were only a few shelves inside. There were no divine power stones on them, only storage rings.
         Li Hao's eyes turned green!
         The storage rings could not be stacked, so each storage ring would take up some space. It was impossible for an ordinary person to carry so many storage rings.
         100 ... Was it full?
         How many divine energy stones were there?
         It was simply unimaginable!
         "Your Xu family also has an energy mine?" Li Hao asked, as if he did not care.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Xu Xing was stunned. Energy mine?
         After a long while, he smiled bitterly and said,"are you talking about the energy mine recorded in the ancient books, emissary?" That's not it ... The Xu family doesn't have this. They only found it in some historical remains and accumulated it. "
         "Oh!"
         "I've seen some humans use it before," Li Hao said."They were all trash. Are you all like this?"
         "The trash that the emissary mentioned ... I'm not too sure what the standard is. You can take a look for yourself."   Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony. He controlled the Black Panther to grab a storage ring, checked it with his divine will, and then casually threw it on the shelf, as if he didn't care at all.
         ,m That feeling ... He was worse than trash.  But in reality, he was already breathing in!
         There were at least 10000 divine power stones in the storage ring.
         Oh my God, what kind of concept is this?
         Could it be that there were millions of divine power stones stored here?
         Impossible!
         When Li Hao asked for 30000 crystals, he thought that he was asking for too much and that Silver Moon was going to go bankrupt. But now, Silver moon's Treasury had over a hundred storage rings.
         If there were at least 10000 of them, wouldn't it be a million?
         "They're all trash!"
        
         Li Hao was shocked, but his mind wavered."The other storage rings all have this kind of stuff?"
         Xu Xing was embarrassed. Anyone who entered the Xu family's Treasury would be shocked!
         Now, he was being despised.
         No, he was despised by the Yao.
         However, he had nothing to say, so he could only say,""It's all like this. There are actually some high-purity divine energy stones as well ... But they're all with father. There are only these here, and there aren't many high-purity ones either ... They can only satisfy our own cultivation."
         "Oh!"
         Li Hao didn't seem to mind. He looked around and found that the first floor was quite spacious. Besides the rows of shelves and some storage rings, there were also some other things.
         He controlled the Black Panther and walked in another direction. He glanced around and said in disdain,""You guys pick up scraps? You even want these?"
         Other than the shelves, there were also boxes. In each box, there was an armor.
         There were a lot of them!
          Seeing that he was being looked down upon again, Xu Xing could only say,""These aren't really broken. The emissary might not know this, but this is a military armor called the air destroyer ... It was actually found in a ruin, but we haven't been able to find a way to reactivate it ... The heaven battling armor that has appeared in heaven battling city and the black armored Army's Black armored armor are all powerful armors from the ancient civilization ..."
         Li Hao's heart moved, but he said,""Of course this King knows! There are a lot of them in the Imperial Palace, and they're of a higher grade than this. These are all worn by small fries, what else can they be if not scrap metal?"
         "Emissary, is there an Army in the Imperial Palace?" Xu Xing's heart stirred.
         "Nonsense!"
         Li Hao said contemptuously,'the Imperial Palace, the Imperial Palace, the palace of the sovereign, of course, there are guards! He was chosen from thousands of powerful armies. I've also heard from my ancestor that heaven battling city is not weak, but it was just an ancient city left behind by a venerable sovereign who casually gave it a name. It can't be compared with the Imperial Palace itself, and the heaven battling Army can't be compared with the Imperial Army of the Imperial Palace ..."
         Xu Xing felt that he had learned something new!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com So that was how it was!
         At this moment, not only him, even Xu Qing, who was secretly eavesdropping, felt that he had learned something new.
         It turned out that heaven battling city was an ancient city bestowed by a venerable sovereign during the ancient civilization period. Even so, it was still so terrifying. It was said that the Golden Warriors in it still had incomparably powerful strength even today.
         At this moment, Xu Xing's communication Jade vibrated. He picked it up and looked at it. His eyes flickered as he said,"Does that emissary know much about heaven battling city?"
         "Heaven battling city?"
         Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"I don't know much. I only know that there were many humans in heaven battling city. It was said that there were tens of millions of people, and the heaven battling Army had a million ..."
         "Then, do you know that there are some Warriors in golden armor ..."
         "Oh, you mean those division commanders?"
         Xu Xing was overjoyed. This person was truly omniscient. With an ancient heritage, he was indeed powerful. He knew everything.
          The foundation of heaven battling city that countless people had yet to understand had been casually pointed out by the other party.  Li Hao seemed to be recalling something. He said telepathically,""A division commander can manage ten thousand people, right? I don't really remember, but I heard a long time ago that there were only one or two hundred division commanders in heaven battling city. There were also commanders, commanders, and so on, and a division commander ... Was just a small head!"
         Xu Xing gasped!
         How was that possible?
         "Emissary, it is said that the Lord of Heaven battling city is only a gold-tier warrior ..."
         "Bullshit!"
         Li Hao cursed,"how is that possible?!" He was almost blind! Besides, which city Lord would wear armor? I remember the great ancestor said that the city Lord of heaven battling city seems to be ... A branch of a certain venerable sovereign or something, surnamed Wang? He's a very powerful old man ..."
         Xu Xing was even more shocked. In that case, the news that had spread so far was all fake!
         Heaven battling city was not that simple.
         He wanted to ask more questions, but Li Hao said impatiently,""Why are you talking about this? who would remember so much? other than this trash, there's no real treasure here."
         Xu Xing was a little helpless.
         Were these all trash?
         A large number of divine power stones, countless mysterious energy, and thousands of sets of ancient civilization armor. If it were not for the fact that they could not be used, any single one of them would be a treasure.
         That's right, he has a big background and has seen a lot.
         He immediately said,"there are some treasures on the second floor. You might be interested in them. They are all origin God weapons. Of course, their levels are not too high."
          Some!
         Li Hao clicked his tongue again. What did he mean by a little?
         He didn't waste any time and went straight to the second floor.
         The decorations on the second floor were different. There were individual cabinets that were dazzling.
         There were quite a few cabinets, but many of them were empty.
         Some of the cabinets were filled with things. At a glance ... There were at least 20 to 30 cabinets on the second floor with things inside. Some of them were emitting a faint energy, showing some extraordinary aspects.
         There were fiery-red long blades, khaki greatswords, and frost-like arrows ...
         At this moment, Xu Xing peeked at Heibao cautiously, afraid that this guy would call him trash again. He immediately said,""These are all origin God weapons ..."
         "I know!"
         Li Hao said bluntly,"they're also trash. Moreover, they're very unfriendly to the demon race!" "These so-called origin God weapons were all made from the corpses of the demon race. They were abolished a long time ago. During the new era of martial arts, they were only used in the early stages. In the later stages, new divine weapons were used. These origin God weapons ... Were all phased out and were given to individual cultivators or people in the rear."
        
         Xu Xing felt that he had learned something new once again!
         So that was how it was!
         "The messenger said that the wind chasing boots contained the demon race's origin ..."
         He couldn't help but ask again,"according to you, the wind chasing boots are also a garbage divine weapon?"
         Li Hao was also stunned, but he quickly cursed,""What do you know! If the wind chasing boots were a divine weapon of the eight great families, then it would be different. Even if it was an origin divine weapon, it was forged from the body of an incomparably powerful monster race, not something these pieces of trash can compare to!"
         Okay.
         Xu Xing looked at the treasure vault that he had been so proud of in the past. Today, he suddenly felt a little sorrowful. It turned out that our family's treasure, which was coveted by other experts, was just trash in the eyes of others!
         One should know that there were millions of divine power stones and dozens of origin God weapons!
         The most important treasures of the Xu family were all with Xu Qing.
         However, this was the core of the Xu clan, the most important place. It was the foundation of the Xu clan's rise to power, to dominate the East, and to dominate the dynasty ... But in this man's words, it was nothing more than trash.
          Li Hao naturally didn't care about this.
         Hiding in the Black Panther's stomach, he was almost drooling.
         Oh my God, he's rich.
         Although he had also obtained many origin God weapons ... He had even given little tree more than ten of them at once. However, he still drooled after seeing dozens of them at once.
         At this moment, he only wanted to snatch!
         ,m But after thinking about it, he held back.  No!
         A little impatience spoils a great plan. I haven't even seen the wind-chasing boots.
         "If the second floor is filled with trash, then the third floor wouldn't be filled with trash as well, right?"
         At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be extremely dissatisfied!
         "Your Duke dingguo's mansion is very famous in the East and is known as the eastern Overlord, but in the end ... It's just this trash? If that's the case, I'll have to reevaluate the strength of your Duke dingguo's mansion! "Powerhouses are one point, and wealth is also one point. If wealth is not enough, it is useless even if there are many powerhouses ... We will be powerless in the future!"
         Xu Xing also felt that he had lost a lot of face.
         However, he couldn't say anything. Could it be that these were all treasures that people outside would break their heads over?
         However, there was no point in saying this to a descendant of an ancient Fey. He had seen much more and much stronger than he had seen.
         He had been full of confidence in the treasures on the third floor.
         However, at this moment, he was a little unconfident. He said vaguely,""The treasures on the third floor are much better than here. Emissary, you can go up and take a look ..."  He didn't dare to boast, for fear of being slapped in the face.
         He was not used to being slapped in the face. It had always been him who slapped others in the face.
         But today, he had been slapped in the face again and again by a strange dog, but he couldn't get angry. He had to admit that the dog's standards were too high, so what else could he say?
         A man and a dog went up to the third floor.
         There were even fewer things on the third floor.
         However, the layout was different. At this moment, there were several crystal-like covers on the huge third floor. Some energy was still leaking out from them. It seemed like they were protecting the treasures inside the covers.
         "There are a total of six treasures on the third floor ... All of them are rare treasures!"
         Xu Xing still braced himself and introduced,""Among them, there are three origin God weapons, all of which are earth-grade, incomparable to the Xuan and Huang-grade ones. The other three are also very precious treasures. One of them ..."
         Just as he was about to speak, Li Hao took the initiative to say,""Eh, heavenly Golden Lotus? And a whole one at that? where did he get it from? This is a treasure from the forbidden Sea during the neo martial era. Of course, it doesn't have much effect on the strong, but it's quite effective on the weak ... Your family actually has one. Not bad!"
         Xu Xing was taken aback. Holy sh * t, you even know this!
         As expected, he had good insight!
         He said hurriedly,"I also obtained this from a historical site. However ... This item ... Has some drawbacks. Actually, when I first discovered it, there was more than one flower. It's very helpful in strengthening the divine intent of martial masters." "However, after the divine intent is strengthened, the body can't withstand it and will collapse even more easily. I found quite a few of them, but many of the Xu family members consumed them. Many of them died ... Their bodies collapsed, and only one flower was left. I was planning to use it after my nephew advances ... Sigh, my poor nephew, he died in the hands of an evil person."
         Li Hao cursed in his heart!
         ܳ!
         My heavenly Golden Lotus!
          It wasn't just one flower, but many. In the end, the bastards of the Xu family wasted all of them. From what Xu Xing said, they had obtained the treasure and used it as they pleased. As a result, their mental strength had increased too much, and their physical bodies weren't strong enough. Their mental strength had crushed their bodies.
         He deserved it!
         Of course, this thing was very effective. It was of great help to Li Hao, let alone other martial masters. If they took too much of it, and their internal organs were not strong enough, they would be killed!
         Apart from the three origin divine weapons, Li Hao could only recognize the sky Golden Lotus for the other three treasures.
         There were two other treasures that he did not recognize.
         One seemed to be the fragment of some weapon, but it looked very mysterious. It might be the remnant of a powerful weapon.
         One of them was a token-like object, but it was a little blurry and the words on it couldn't be seen clearly. He didn't know what token it was, or if it was just an ordinary square.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As for the three divine weapons, they were indeed a grade higher than the ones below.
         He felt that it was even more powerful than the wind chimes he had obtained before.
         The Xu family was indeed a big family. No wonder they were the Overlord force that had suppressed the East for 200 years. The key was that this was only a part of the Xu family's wealth. The real treasures were probably with Xu Qing.
        
         But even so ... This place was probably where most of the Xu family's wealth was.
         Li Hao was extremely envious.
         However, at this moment, he couldn't show it. He still felt a little disgusted."Forget it, there's nothing good here. This Skygold Lotus is actually quite good, but it's not very useful to the demon race. It's a wasted trip!"
         Xu Xing was helpless.
         Your vision is just too high.
         He had wanted to say that he would use some treasures to exchange for some spring water of life, but now he couldn't even say it.
         Who would have thought that there would be a day when the Xu family's Treasury would be looked down upon?
         Li Hao controlled the Black Panther to go downstairs. As he walked, he said telepathically,""This trash, there's nothing to see. When will you let me see your wind-chasing boots?"
         "This ... Emissary, please wait for a while. The Windchaser's boots are with my father. When my father comes out of seclusion, I will report to you immediately ..."
         "Be more efficient. The human race is always so slow!"
          "Definitely, definitely!"
         At this moment, Xu Xing was like a grandson, but he didn't feel that there was anything wrong with it.
         While walking, he glanced at his communication Jade and said carefully,""Messenger, if the wind chasing boots are not what kui Shan needs, then our cooperation ..."
         "Then we'll see!" Li Hao said impolitely.
         At this moment, Xu Xing was a little anxious. He was hoping that the wind chasing boots were what the other party needed.
         "Emissary, if I may ask, this Dragon God of Mount kui ... And the Imperial Palace ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Lord Dragon God is the outer Guardian of the Imperial Palace. The existences of the Imperial Palace can't come out easily, so he just gave some casual guidance. Lord Dragon God's talent is not bad. He has cultivated to this level, and now, his relationship with the Imperial Palace has become much closer."
         Xu Xing understood. So that's how it is. He's just a gatekeeper.
         No wonder when he mentioned this Golden Demon, he only said that he had a noble status and didn't dare to say anything more.
         "Emissary, if the wind-chasing boots are something that the Dragon God needs, then is what you said earlier about the five great demons sunguang serving the high Duke's public house true?" Xu Xing asked.
         Li Hao's heart moved. He was tempted!
         From the looks of it, Xu Qing, that old fogey, was the one who manipulated them from behind the scenes.
         He bragged once again, his spiritual fluctuations filled with pride. "They're just five demons of the rising light tribe! If the Dragon God successfully advanced, the safety of the Imperial Palace's periphery would be guaranteed. What would five mere sunguang do? "The Mount kui lineage has countless demons. Just tell me how many you want! What we need are powerhouses, powerhouses that are stronger than sunguang, and sunguang is just a small fry ... If the Dragon God doesn't advance, when those in the Imperial Palace ... Cough, cough, I can't tell you. In any case, if the Dragon God doesn't advance successfully, we won't need it anymore!"
         Xu Xing was shocked, but he understood what he meant. These ancient Fey might be leaving the Imperial Palace?
         He suddenly became anxious. Mount kui was not far from the East.
         That would be ... Dangerous!
         "Are the Lords of the Imperial Palace coming out?"
         He asked carefully.
         "It's none of your business!"
         Li Hao said proudly,"even if you come out, I won't care about you. I can see through your thoughts!" Come out, we're also going to the Silver Moon land! "Our goal is not here, not even this world, but the depths of the sky. You won't understand even if I explain it. We will follow the footsteps of the ancient kings, the footsteps of the venerable sovereigns, and leave this place ... Your standards are too low, it's just a continent. In the past, the core of the Heavenly Star dynasty, your so-called central continent, was just a small Heavenly Star Island. Now, the imperial family of the dynasty has only occupied the ruins of the Heavenly Star Town, which is why they have some capital ..."
         Xu Xing felt as if his three views were about to explode!
         What did that mean?
         ……
         At the same time.
         Xu Qing's expression also changed as he muttered to himself,""Heavenly Star Island, Heavenly Star Town ... I see! Silver Moon ... So the goal of these ancient civilizations was never this land ... So the dynasty really is just an Island ... Unbelievable ..."
         However, after linking it to the information he had, he still believed it.
         In his eyes, there was only shock and desire!
         Li Hao's words made him suddenly believe that kui Shan would not be interested in the Duke dingguo's mansion.
         Even if they occupied the East, the other party would not care.
         But he cared.
          In that case, there was a Foundation for cooperation.  The other party's request for cooperation might only be temporary, and it might be difficult for those existences to come out now ... And this was actually an opportunity for the high Duke's public house.
         Once he missed it, he might never have such an opportunity again.
         "Wind-chasing boots ..."
         He gritted his teeth. Since he had already lost one, he would just take it that he had lost the second one!
         The other party might really return the favor.
         According to this little demon, if the Snake King didn't break through, she would be abandoned. Once she was abandoned ... The wind-chasing boots would probably be useless.
         At this moment, he should help the Snake King break through. This way, the Snake King would be able to stand firm and would be grateful for the Xu family's help in breaking through.
         With the Snake King as a link, he could reach a cooperation with kuishan Imperial Palace.
         After thinking through this, Xu Qing knew what he should do.
         At this moment, he had completely believed in Heibao's identity. He had no choice because Heibao knew too many things. There were some things that the Xu family didn't know as much as Heibao did even after excavating countless relics for 200 years.
         This half-understanding made him believe Li Hao's words without doubt.
         If Li Hao didn't understand anything, he would be playing the zither to a cow no matter how much he said.
         What he was afraid of was that she only understood a little but not completely.
         In this way, Li Hao's words were lethal and shocking.
         ……
         At this moment, Xu Xing seemed to have received some instructions. He said,""Emissary, after daybreak, the Xu clan's grand ceremony will begin. People from the other provinces of the East will come. At that time, would emissary be interested in attending?"
         "It's boring!"
         Li Hao was playing hard to get. Xu Xing hurriedly said,""By then, father might come out of his secluded cultivation. If father comes out of his secluded cultivation, he could bring out his wind-chasing boots!"
         "Alright, this King will go and watch the show!" Li Hao immediately said.
         Xu Xing was overjoyed, but then he cursed in his heart!
         There was no other reason. His father had said that after daybreak, he was not to offer the Windchaser's boots ... No, he was not to offer the Windchaser's boots in his hands. He was to wait for him to come and host it personally!
         Motherf * cker!
         At this moment, how could Xu Xing not understand the meaning behind this? it was fake!
         The wind-chasing boots that the old man had given him were fake to deceive people. But now, the demon race envoy was here. If he offered a fake one and the other party found out that it was not what he needed, he would turn hostile and leave. That would be inappropriate.
         It was obvious that his father was prepared to personally appear. The offering was really ... Really not good.
         You say it so righteously, is my Xu family afraid of being robbed?
         However, he still gave himself a fake one.
         The more Xu Xing thought about it, the angrier he got!
         At this moment, looking at Black Panther again, he had some ideas in his heart. In the past, he thought that his father was unattainable, but now it seemed that he was just so-so. If he could form a relationship with this descendant of the ancient demon and obtain the support of the Imperial Palace, would his father dare to refuse to pass on the throne to him?
          No... Perhaps ... He could think more.
         Could a mere state Duke be satisfied?
         And the key to all of this was the big golden dog in front of him.
         At this moment, Xu Xing became much humbler and more enthusiastic. His smile made Li Hao's scalp tingle. What was he smiling for?
         Did I blow my own trumpet and let you guys discover something?
         He was a little nervous, but at this point, Li Hao could only brace himself and continue to pretend.
         Li Hao left the treasure vault with a cold and heartless gait. At this moment, he had changed his mind. The Windchaser's boots ... They weren't enough. He wouldn't be satisfied if he didn't take out this treasure vault before he left.
         He had to think, how could he get rid of them all?
         It would be best if he could create some big trouble for the high Duke's public house!
         Otherwise, when these guys were idle, they would definitely chase him to his death.
        
         p It was a busy night.  The sky gradually brightened.
         This day was the memorial Day for the eldest son of the high Duke's public house and the eldest grandson of the eldest branch.
         Xu Feng's sacrifice was also sacrificed.
         And these two had both died at Li Hao's hands. It could be said that Li Hao's enmity with the Duke dingguo's mansion had even surpassed the enmity between him and Hong Yue. Of course, this was the Duke dingguo's mansion's enmity towards Li Hao.
         Just like how Li Hao hated Hong Yue, Hong Yue also wanted to eat Li Hao's flesh.
         This was how Jianghu was.
         You kill me, I kill you. There are many grudges in the pugilistic world.
         Thus, even if the Xu family hated Li Hao to the point of death, Li Hao didn't take it to heart. For example, Ying Hongyue probably didn't care whether Li Hao hated her or not. Since ancient times, the winner was the king and the loser was the bandit. The Xu family captured and killed Li Hao, and Li Hao killed Ying Hongyue. This hatred naturally disappeared.
         As the sky brightened, the high Duke's public house also began to become lively.
          Some voices could be heard from the square outside.
         Duke dingguo was close to the people. He built a Leisure Square in front of his house. His son died, his grandson died, but he was still open. It was rare to see such a hypocritical person. Of course, if he won in the end and won the world, it would not be hypocritical, but true kindness.
         This kind of person could be quite scary at times.
         Li Hao was lying in the Black Panther's stomach. The Black Panther's stomach was quite spacious and not that dirty. This guy's internal organs were almost as hard as steel, and there was no flesh and blood.
         At this moment, Li Hao was still thinking about the other party's treasure vault.
         Should he leave after getting the wind-chasing boots, or should he take the whole pot?
         This was what Li Hao was thinking.
         If he had simply cheated the wind-chasing boots, he would probably be exposed in a few days. However, it was much safer, and he might be able to leave the high Duke's public house smoothly.
         However, there was a requirement for borrowing something.
         It was impossible for the Snake King of Mount kui to really send the five great demons of the rising sun, much less send a large amount of the spring of life as interest. After three to five days, it would probably be exposed.
         However, this was enough time for Li Hao to escape.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Do you want to take a risk, or do you want to leave after getting the Windchaser's boots?"
         Li Hao asked himself, but he had no one to ask. Perhaps Black Panther felt that there was someone in his stomach and didn't sleep well. He rolled back and forth on the ground, which made Li Hao's heart restless.
         "If the high Duke's public house doesn't fall into chaos, I'll be able to swindle the Windchaser's boots and expose too many of my trump cards ... I'm afraid Xu Qing will personally go into battle to kill me."
         "Today, the powerhouses from all the major provinces in the East have gathered here. The high Duke's public house probably wants me to take this opportunity to intimidate them ..."
         He was using kui Shan to intimidate some people.
         Kui Shan was not weak. On the surface, he had one in the metamorphosis stage, several in the sunguang stage, and many in the three suns. To an ordinary province, he was an enemy that they could not afford to offend.
         "Intimidating ... That means that the high Duke's public house's control over the East is not as strong as you think. Some of these people can even stand up to the other party."  "The strongest Overlord in the East is the Xu family, but it seems like there are a few other families that can compete with them. If the Xu family could suppress all 21 provinces, they would have long since dominated a region."
         Many thoughts flashed through Li Hao's mind.
         At this moment, voices could be heard from outside.
         "The Dingbian province Administration Director has arrived!"
         Outside the door, there were people from the high Duke's public house making noise.
         The people who came to hold a memorial service were all important people. Naturally, they had to sing it out to show the public house's prestige and connections.
         Dingbian province was right under the eyes of the public house, so it was naturally a part of the public house. The director of the administration department here was just a decoration, but even so, his status was extremely high. In the entire star dynasty, hundreds of millions of miles of land, there were only 99 directors of the administration department.
         The fact that this person had come so early was obviously to give face to the high Duke's public house.
         Li Hao listened in silence and didn't do anything.
         Xu Xing asked him to rest for a while and said that he would be invited over later. According to Li Hao's speculation, the Xu family might only invite him over when everyone was here, so that they would be caught unprepared.
         ……
         Outside the public house.
         Small cars slowly came to a stop.
         Of course, there were also those who didn't follow the normal path. There were armored experts who came directly on their mounts. Some were demonic beasts, while others were ordinary horses. However, they were also astonishingly large.
         Some experts even came with their origin divine weapons.
         There were flying ships and palanquins.
         Most of these people had strength, and they were not weak.
          Apart from Dingbian, there were 20 other provinces. A large province with a population of hundreds of millions. The East was extremely rich and mysterious, and in terms of the number of experts, it was stronger than the North.
         Apart from Silvermoon and the other cunning fellows, the northern side was the weakest of the four continents in terms of strength.
         Today, experts from all the provinces had gathered.
         Although not all the people who came were the highest-ranking officers or the strongest experts, almost all of them were led by Xu Guang, a senior official of a province, or the spokesperson of an Overlord. They were all very impressive.
         In some provinces, even the highest-ranking officials had personally arrived.
         On the high Duke's public house's side, there were many changes.
         Many powerhouses had fallen, including nine sunguang 's. This had also caused some of the previously suppressed provinces to become restless. Some people also wanted to personally investigate. The current High Duke's public house still had some strength.
         Nine sunguangs was not a small number.
         Moreover, even the weakest Xu Feng had the power of the middle stage of the rising light realm.
         Although the Xu family had a strong foundation, they had lost so many experts all of a sudden. It was even more than the number of Red moon's experts who had died in Silver Moon.
