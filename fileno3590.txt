 "The second goal is to repay the debt. Saving the three of them ... Is only saving their lives ... To repay the debt!""The third goal is to collect enough resources. Everyone is in need of them!""The fourth goal is to weaken the strength of all rank 9 forces, including Tian Fang!""Fifth ... Deal with long Zhan!"Everyone was shocked. Good fellow, it's fine if you don't want to do it, but this time, you want to do it all!Li Hao laughed, long Zhan, I admire him! But ... I have to kill him! This isn't contradictory. I admire him for fighting for his race and for supporting the primal Chaos race on his own. However, he is my enemy, a great enemy! I killed his wife, his subordinates, and seized his subsidiary world. At the same time, I don't want the chaos to become the Dominator...So, I will kill him last, but when the time is right, I will kill him!""This time, I hope that everyone will improve, especially Lin Hongyu!" He looked at the group of people.Lin Hongyu was stunned.me?'What ... Does it have to do with me?To this day, she had only just stepped into the fifth rank. To be honest, in this era where the high-level cultivators were rampant, the fifth rank was nothing.Li Hao laughed."This time, you have to build a good hell. I have to kill people. When I kill, there will be corpses, souls, spirits, and origins. It doesn't matter if they revive or resurrect. You're not strong. When my people die, how can I capture their origins and spirits and resurrect them? If I can preserve their bodies, I can even reverse the situation and directly revive them to their full strength!""You don't have to reverse yin and yang like the human King did. It's actually quite a drag. You resurrected people, but your strength has fallen greatly. You still have to absorb a large amount of energy again to recover ... It's a lose-lose situation!"Everyone was speechless again.You ... Despise the human King?He really wasn't human!"In addition, director Zhao, immediately mobilize all the Silver Moon cultivators to cultivate the divine text. I want to ... Gather the divine text and nurture the spirit! Soldiers are trained for a thousand days, but they can be used in a single moment. I want to strengthen my spirit so that it can rule over ten thousand DAOs. Only then will I have the opportunity to continue growing stronger in the course of battle. Although I've established three thousand realms, I'm still very weak. I can only make it to five thousand DAOs at most!""What's with this kind of strength? I'm nothing in the ranks of the chaotic world!""There!"Everyone acknowledged the order. At this moment, all of them were a little excited. It was as if ... They had returned to the time when they resisted heavenstar together.However, Li Hao wasn't satisfied with this. He looked around and finally looked at one person."Lingyue!"The Queen quickly appeared and said nervously,""What's wrong?"Why are you calling me?Li Hao looked at her and smiled."You've gathered countless of your billions of humans, but they've only believed in you. It's too monotonous. Now, there's no safe place for them to settle down, but we can't let them have nothing to do. What's the point of believing in you? What can you bring them?"“……”Lingyue was speechless.What did that mean?Li Hao smiled."Today, there's actually another truth in the chaos. There's strength in numbers!"The Queen seemed to have understood something. Sure enough, Li Hao smiled."Your people believe in you. Then let them ... All cultivate the divine text. I don't care if they can do it or not. There are countless humans, but someone will. I want the divine text and support my Dao spirit! One-ten-thousandth of a trillion humans is a trillion, or even one-hundred-thousandth of a hundred-thousandth, but that's still a hundred billion divine runes. I've said long ago that the People's hearts are the most terrifying!""Your people are all very devout. Go and get them to cultivate. Don't delay. As for the energy needed for cultivation, I will think of a way ... Next, senior second cat needs help. If someone's Dao is completely incompatible with us ... I will have to trouble senior!"Simply put, it was a copy.Second cat had nothing to live for.What a joke, one or two is fine, but trillions? let me die. This time, I'm serious. I don't want to live anymore. What's the point of living?The queen's heart trembled. Trillions of humans cultivating divine runes ... That was too terrifying. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  She had no choice but to say,"their DAOs all have some power of faith. There's too much. I'm afraid ..."Li Hao laughed,"what am I afraid of?" If there's too much, I'll give it all to martial uncle Hong!"“……”Are you still human?Everyone was speechless.He didn't know whether to laugh or cry.Alright, I understand.Before, Li Hao had never thought about how these humans could help him, because it involved a large amount of power of faith. They were too pious and terrifying. But now, Li Hao seemed to have found a trash can.Hong Yitang.That's right, who asked him to accept the path of faith?Then it's him!The Queen didn't say anything else."Alright, I understand. It doesn't affect her much anyway. It's terrifying to consume so much energy with so many people. But Li Hao said that he'll think of a way, so it has nothing to do with me."Anyway, they had nothing to do. This group of people were almost turning into robots now and only knew how to pray. In fact, it was not a good thing. After a long time, their hearts would be completely destroyed.It was a good thing to cultivate and distract himself."Understood!""That's good. "Finally, Li Hao looked at everyone and suddenly laughed."On this trip, I will uphold justice, spread my divine might, protect justice, hunt demons, and spread the Dao!"“……”Everyone was speechless. This ... This was a slogan that had been used to fool people so many years ago.Back then, because of this slogan, there were many people killed.In the crowd, the members of the demon hunting squad were somewhat dazed. "We haven't said this in a long time. It's embarrassing to say it."

3591 Chapter 581
At this moment, Li Hao laughed."The Silver Moon people are good at everything, but there's one bad thing about them. They're too shameless. Let's watch the new martial arts ... This time, we're going to be the human King. Being shameless is also a skill! "On neo martial's side, no one wants face ..."Everyone burst into laughter.A few neo martial cultivators in the crowd were speechless. 'It's fine if the human King doesn't want face, but we still want it.'Soon, they laughed as well.This wasn't belittling him. In their eyes, this was a compliment. Only those who were shameless ... Could be accepted.……The void fluctuated.In a situation where no one else could see, in one of the passages, countless illusionary figures appeared. They were rapidly moving from the distance towards Tian Fang.At this moment, some of these figures were excited, some were agitated, and some were depressed.Return to Tian Fang!He had left Tian Fang for too long.However, his return this time might not be smooth."This time, the Daoist master also asked us to get in touch with the time cultivator," someone suddenly said."We're not familiar with him ... Coiling Dragon, you've all been in contact with him. Although it was only for a moment, you should have some feelings, right?"Among the crowd, the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor maintained his human form. When he saw someone looking at him, he pondered for a moment before saying,""It's hard to say. I've only met him once during a Dao debate in the past. The second time was on the day of the Daoist master's birthday banquet. Everyone knows ... This ... It's hard for me to say. However, I feel that anyone who can cultivate time is not weak. They're not the kind ...."He didn't say much. In fact, he wanted to say ... That he should try not to have too much contact with Li Hao this time.He was actually a ruthless person.This was because he had killed many people with the help of others. He was a cruel and merciless person who did not consider the consequences at all. If he really wanted to consider, he would not have borrowed the strength of others back then.It's not easy to return it."What are you afraid of? doesn't he owe you a favor?"Someone laughed and said,"the trouble this time is long Zhan. If the three of you encounter that Li Hao, it's best to let him help us deal with long Zhan. It's best if both sides suffer!""He's not an idiot ..."Coiling Dragon frowned.What was he thinking?Did the silence of a million years affect everyone?Just as he was thinking, the person who had spoken earlier suddenly snorted.""He's not an idiot, and neither are we. What I'm thinking is that long Zhan is also a member of the Dragon race. Coiling Dragon, I hope you can understand that you are a cultivator of the Heaven's Will!"We are not idiots, but we know that you are also a Dragon.So ... This time, you must use this favor from Li Hao to deal with long Zhan, understand?The Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor's face darkened. He did not say anything.There were many emissaries from Tian Fang, and they were all strong. Some of them were even at level 8. Even if they weren't before, there was a high chance that they would become level 8 after this recovery. Therefore, he had a high chance of becoming a level 8 too.However, he wasn't a human, much less a Tian Fang human.He himself was actually a beast of primordial chaos, a tamed beast of primordial chaos.The dragon clan!Clearly, everyone was not too at ease with him.,m The Coiling Dragon Thearch remained silent, but Daoist Firerock spoke up.""There's no need to make things difficult for Coiling Dragon. Given the opportunity, we will naturally do it. Death emissary, there are some things that we will weigh on our own. You don't have to doubt anyone. Coiling Dragon has joined us Tian Fang for a long time, no different from us cultivators ..."It was no different. After all, there were still some differences.The Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor sighed in his heart but did not say anything. Huo Yan was an easy-going person. Even though he was a fire-element cultivator, he was not as popular as the others.In fact, the others had always disliked him.This time, the opponent was still the dragon clan, so he was even more vigilant."Alright, I'm done!"At the front of the crowd, the radiant envoy suddenly interrupted,""I haven't entered tianfang and haven't completely recovered yet. This time, we're back, and everyone can improve. The important thing is to complete the Dao master's plan, not ... To kill someone!"He then smiled."In the past, I left the light and was also an outsider. I joined tianfang. Once I joined, we're a family. There's no need to distinguish between us! What I'm curious about now is whether there are any more inheritances in my realm. I remember that when I left, there were already people who rose up in the realm ...""If it still exists, how strong would it be today?"He was a little curious and confused. He looked at the mouth of darkness."Darkness, I remember that you left the dark great world in the past. I wonder how you are now ..."The dark Demon emissary shook his head."I'm not too sure. It's been so many years. Who knows what the situation is like?""I can vaguely sense it ... It's very weak, but the inheritance might still be in the world of light!" The radiant envoy said with a smile.Everyone revealed a smile. They didn't really target this person.The messengers of light and darkness were all outsiders, but they were all humans.Moreover, he had given up on his own world a few years ago and joined Tian Fang. He had become a light and dark emissary and was very powerful. He was an early stage level 8 powerhouse in Tian Fang. At that time, the master of Tian Fang wasn't even a level 9. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Therefore, even though these two were outsiders, they were much more valued and respected than the Coiling Dragon.As they chatted, the radiant envoy suddenly looked at the Thunder giant behind him and frowned. At this moment, as they got closer to the square domain, the Thunder giant was changing.It was originally just a will, but at this moment, it seemed like there were countless of them, causing the powerhouses to become serious.What was going on?

3592 Chapter 581
It was as if this giant wasn't made up of one person, but tens of millions of people!At the thought of this, the powerhouses frowned. This might not be good news.He stopped looking. Something seemed to have changed in front of his eyes.At this moment, they seemed to be getting closer and closer to the sky. The dark tunnel around them gradually became transparent, and they could see the situation outside clearly. Everyone was extremely happy.It had been a million years!Top-notch experts could observe the heavens, but they couldn 't. If they weren't in a deep sleep, they would have gone crazy long ago. Now that they could once again see the familiar Primal Chaos, they were still very excited.However ... After a while, someone said,""It seems to be a bit desolate, not as good as it was in the past. Sure enough, cultivation is worse with each generation! In my opinion, those so-called chaotic overlords are just so-so ...""Alright, I'm done!"The radiant envoy rebuked again,"that's all you got?" Have you forgotten the scene from a million years ago?"What was he thinking!Only so?But if that's the case, have you forgotten that we were easily defeated when we joined forces back then?Was that group of people to be trifled with?Did he forget?"That was in the past ...""Besides," someone said in a low voice,"it was the enemy who interfered with time, but it doesn't mean that we really fought them. Besides, the strongest group of people in modern chaos joined hands at that time! Moreover, we're much stronger than we were a million years ago!"He still couldn't accept the fact that he was easily defeated by someone who came after him.The battle at the birthday banquet a million years ago was actually very shallow in their memories. It was as if it was just a memory, and they had never really fought. Therefore, some of them did not think that they had been easily defeated by Li Hao's team.The radiant envoy didn't bother to say more. It was normal for Tian Fang cultivators to be proud. They had the right to be proud.Furthermore, they had not been idle for the past million years. They had spent most of their time comprehending the ninth-grade Dao. In terms of inheritance, they were naturally much stronger than the current chaos cultivators.The present chaos was definitely not comparable to a million years ago."Be quiet. This time ... We have to be careful."Just as he said that, there seemed to be a change in the front."Huh? what's that?"The dark passage ahead seemed to be a little different. It was as if there was something more. It was as if there was a River in the passage. It was a little strange, and everyone was puzzled.Was it Dao master's doing?This passageway was built by the path master. The means of a tier 9 was not something they could understand.Why would there be a River?That's strange! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ And at this moment.There seemed to be a pair of eyes on the river.……Yes, it was Li Hao.Time star!He had always been fusing with the chaos to observe the world. At this moment, he had also discovered some abnormalities. Previously, he had known that Time and Stars seemed to have cut into this teleportation passageway.It was Zhan's doing.He did not know why. At this moment, he might have understood. Surveillance?Or ... Was it to kill a strong enemy?He could actually see that group of people through the time star at this moment. Those countless shadows, virtual shadows.With just one look ... Li Hao's heart moved.So many!Almost all of them were advanced venerable sovereigns. It seemed like not everyone in Tian Fang, including the mortal cultivators, had returned. Instead, they were ... Venerable sovereigns!Advanced venerable sovereign!At a rough glance, there were at least 30 of them. One had to know that Samsara was powerful in the past. At their peak, four rank eights and more than ten rank Sevens were all Samsara had.However, in front of him ... There were at least thirty to forty people.So many!A level nine world ... It was indeed a level nine world.However, it also seemed to be less than expected. Thinking back to a million years ago, when he turned back time, he had seen some of them. Perhaps ... There were still people who had not recovered, had not returned, or had completely died?Then, he saw the figure of lightning behind them.These must be the powerhouses that the Thunder region was going to revive, right?It actually formed a lightning spirit. Interesting."Snipe them?"Li Hao's heart stirred, but he quickly gave up. Perhaps he could, but if he moved now, he would be exposed. Moreover, if these people didn't return, how could he return the favor?Not returning, how could he make long Zhan uncomfortable?If he didn't return ... Once Tian Fang discovered him, would Tian Fang himself return from here?That's right, this plaything wasn't for the other party, but ... To prevent Tian Fang from returning early!Li Hao understood.Although these people seemed strong and posed a great threat, they were just small fries. The real big fish were ninth rank venerable sovereigns. Would there be any ninth rank venerable sovereigns who would return through this passage?Was it a clone?Or the main body?No matter what, Li Hao had to be careful at this moment. Otherwise, he would lose a lot for a small gain!He quickly retracted his gaze and stopped looking.Then, he thought about the battle. The other party had actually linked Time and Stars with this passage. It was still back when they were in neo martial, and they had seen this passage when they went out ... This was interesting.Battle, did he want the human King and the others to kill their way over?Wasn't he overestimating the human King and the others?Interesting!"It's almost there ... After I pass. "Li Hao withdrew his gaze and looked at the four-sided domain in the distance. He laughed."Go! Let's go!"Soon.p Of course, when they arrived at Tian Fang, they also needed some time to recover. The master of Tian Fang must have made arrangements. At this moment, long Zhan probably had no way to enter Tian Fang to cause destruction.It was very easy for a ninth-grade existence like him to do anything."Senior Dao Qi," he suddenly said,"you can work with Black Panther and the others first ... Also, you were once the monarch weapon of tianfang world. If you have a different opinion, I can understand. There's no need to get involved ..."

When Dao Qi heard this, he hesitated for a while before saying,""I have no intention of betraying Tian Fang, but ..."He said awkwardly,"it's just that I ... I've recently devoured some worlds and the power of great DAOs. It seems ... I've recovered a little ... A little of my memories from the universe I was in. When I was alive, I might ... Be the sector Lord of an eighth-level universe. I was killed by Tian Fang. So, I should ... Be considered his enemy, right?"Li Hao looked at him suspiciously.There was no other reason. He suspected that the other party wanted to betray him, but was afraid of being cursed. Thus ... He was deliberately looking for an excuse.Why did they betray him?It was so simple!In Li Hao's eyes, he was the Lord and also an independent person.However, in Tian Fang, he was just a weapon. To be honest, weapons had spirits, and rebelling was very normal. Li Hao could actually understand this. Who would be willing to be a weapon for their entire life?After gaining a spirit, of course, it was to be himself.He wasn't surprised at all that Dao Qi had betrayed him ...However, this reason must be fake, right?Dao Qi was a little embarrassed. He knew what Li Hao's eyes meant, so he could only explain,""It's true. I ... I'm not lying!"It really was like this!I have a grudge against him, so I didn't lie to you ... Alright, I deceived him a little, so the memory is real. However, he might not be the so-called realm Lord or Dao Lord. He might be a fusion of countless souls in that world.In terms of hatred ... There wasn't much.However, he had to give himself a way out. Anyway, he didn't want to be a weapon anymore. Even if he wanted to be a weapon, he wanted to be a weapon of freedom. Freedom was too comfortable.Looking at the situation now, he was actually the boss on Silver moon's side.It was not anyone's weapon.Even if Li Hao wanted to play chess, he would have to discuss it with him.With freedom, who would want to return to tianfang and become a cold weapon?I'm not willing!"Senior daoqi ... You'll work with Heibao and the others for the time being. I'm afraid that the people from tianfang will be able to locate your existence. Heibao, Hu Qingfeng, and senior daoqi, of the three of you, one has the Dao of calamity and may be located by the experts of the Thunder region. The other is a tianfang soldier and may be located by tianfang. As for Hu Qingfeng ...""Lord Marquis, don't worry!" A person in the crowd said with a smile. I know what to do. Once Lord Marquis gives the order, I'll immediately invite Lord Marquis out!"Please, God!He didn't dare to say that it wasn't a summoning. He was really asking God.Invite Li Hao!Li Hao was also speechless. What the hell did Hu Qingfeng invite?Sometimes, he couldn't even feel at ease!One day, if he really invited a Li Hao, not me ... That would be very embarrassing. The great path has a spirit, and this guy will never reach level nine. After reaching level nine, it would be embarrassing if he really invited a Li Hao with a spirit!"Okay, everyone has the ethereal extent, so we can contact each other at any time and also summon each other at any time! This time ... Silvermoon's name will be known throughout the world again!" Li Hao did not say anything else. He led everyone toward the four-sided domain.Tian Fang had completely returned.……BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the world.Long Zhan threw out a punch, wanting to break through the realm, but he was forced back a few steps. At this moment, a cold look appeared in his eyes. What a good Tian Fang, he was really too strong.The formation set up a million years ago had actually stopped him. The rank 9 world had sealed itself. Under normal circumstances, an existence like him would definitely be able to break it open by force. However, he could not do so now.He was forced to retreat.It might be possible to pay the price, but it might not be worth it to pay such a huge price to split the realm without even seeing anyone.At this moment, the grade 8 cultivators were all very nervous.Red Moon sovereign was even more afraid ... There was a backlash from the Dao of desire.He looked at the figures that suddenly descended from the sky and instantly appeared in tianfang world. The tianfang great Dao universe appeared and at this moment, the stars were instantly ignited. He said nervously,""Dragon Lord, is there no way to break it?"Couldn't they have ambushed them in advance?He could only passively wait for them to awaken and then come out?This ... Made him a little suspicious. Could long Zhan match these people? because he didn't even break through the realm, this made Hong Yue a little uneasy.Long Zhan did not speak. It wasn't that simple. He could break it, but ... Breaking it might not be a good thing. Tian Fang might have some plans. If he continued to break the formation by force, it might be of greater help to Tian Fang's recovery.In the distance, the Thunder region was also constantly rumbling.A human figure seemed to appear in the lightning pillars.……Tianfang world.When everyone's figures appeared, suddenly, the power of the great path surged wildly. Billions of great path crystals shattered and merged into everyone's body. Some people were more than others. The entire world seemed to have come alive.Even the source of the world seemed to have come alive.The universe of the great path began to shine.One star after another began to be ignited. In the crowd, someone's aura suddenly soared. Among the crowd, Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor was a little surprised. When he left, he was only a seventh-rank.After returning this time, he believed that he would be able to step into tier 8 ...However, his own great Dao star seemed to have integrated countless great Dao powers, and ... It was extremely compatible with him. In an instant, his aura skyrocketed. Among all the people, he was the first to recover to the power of a seventh-tier, and in an instant, the aura of an eighth-tier emerged!All of a sudden, the cultivators who were still frantically absorbing the power of the great DAOs around him were extremely surprised and looked at him.Level eight?The first one to reach level eight was even faster than the few who were already level eight venerable sovereigns!How was that possible? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ What was going on?At that moment, the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor frowned slightly ... Not good!Damn it!All of a sudden, he had some understanding. It was long Zhan. The power he had absorbed previously was extremely compatible. It was long Zhan's power. They were all Dragons, so it was naturally compatible. Long Zhan wanted to scheme against him?No... In the next moment, he suddenly understood.Because at this moment, the gazes of the surrounding people seemed to be filled with vigilance.This is troublesome!They are suspecting me!Coiling Dragon's expression changed. Long Zhan did it on purpose?Yes, he must have done it on purpose. He deliberately ... Created a crack. Before he had fully recovered, he was already being suspected.As expected!The next moment, someone said coldly,"brother Coiling Dragon, you're really capable. You're the first to reach the eighth rank. I was at the eighth rank before, but now I've only recovered to the seventh rank. How fast!" This great Dao dragon essence is really compatible. I think brother Coiling Dragon will be the first person in Tian Fang this time! No, the first Dragon!"The Coiling Dragon remained silent. At this moment, there was no point in explaining.Those who believed it would believe it, and those who didn't would never believe it.He looked out of the world and seemed to see a giant dragon. He saw ... A playful look in its eyes, as if saying,"do you like my gift?"In the surroundings, powerful auras began to rise.Tian Fang had officially recovered and returned.At this moment, a loud voice resounded in all directions,""Tianfang world, today, officially awakens! When we return to tianfang, the realm gate will be opened to welcome fellow Daoists from all over the world to discuss Dao in tianfang!"His voice continued to echo!And outside the realm, long Zhan still did not say a word and just waited silently.There was a smile in his eyes.It's a good return!Coiling Dragon ... I'll be waiting for you.As for the others, he didn't care too much. What he cared more about was whether the Lord of Tian Fang's avatar had returned or not.He looked outside, the lightning region was also shaking.It was as if there were waves of powerful auras that were currently spreading and erupting. However, they were not as Grand as Tian Fang 's, who had officially announced his return.The cultivators who heard the sound instantly became nervous.Four regions, two overlords!This ... A great battle was probably unavoidable.

Chapter 3594 Fearless Of Death (1)
The entire place was shaken.Tianfang had returned. The name of the master of tianfang, the number one World and Overlord of the world in the past, still circulated a million years later.This was the only Grade 9 world that still existed in the current chaos.He had always been there!It had never disappeared.Tian Fang's name had never been forgotten in the past million years. Everyone knew of Tian Fang's existence and had thought that Tian Fang might recover. Today, Tian Fang had returned!The auras of grade 8 experts reverberated across the sky.The two light messengers, the two life and death messengers, the five elements messengers, the two Yin Yang messengers ...At this moment, the emissaries 'auras exploded and they charged towards stage 8. Tianfang was the world with the most complete Dao. There were outsiders who came to tianfang to join them, and there were also local experts who proved their Dao.There were many cultivators in Tian Fang, and they were very strong!Furthermore, the great Dao was extremely perfect.The space Dao had gathered 9999 great Dao, and it was the strongest great Dao so far. As for the time Dao, it had yet to reach the ninth stage.These people had not been idle after leaving for a million years.They were all comprehending the Dao.In front of a group of rank nines, these people had been influenced and gained a lot. Now, with enough energy and the crystallization of the great Dao of a million years, many venerable sovereigns had become venerable sovereigns in a short time. Some had recovered to rank eight, while others had advanced to rank eight.It was not just one or two, but many.This was the capital for Tian Fang's recovery.Why did it dare to recover in this era?Why did he dare to awaken at this time?That was because they had enough experts.Yin and yang, life and death, light and darkness, and the five elements were all common great DAOs, and they were also some basic great DAOs. These great DAOs made it easier for Dao vindication experts, and just these emissaries alone numbered 11 level 8 experts.Furthermore, there was also pan long, a cultivator of the path of the physical body, who had also attained level eight.There were as many as 12 level 8 ones.There were also quite a few seventh rank venerable sovereigns. Among the dozens of people who had returned this time, apart from the eighth rank ones, the others were almost all at the seventh rank. Some of them had even reached the peak of the seventh rank.Among the level 8s, some of the older level 8s were not weak either. Among these emissaries, the fifth rank was slightly weaker, but the others were all top powerhouses. They were definitely not weak among the level 8s!All of a sudden, this group of people's aura soared to the sky!The power of a great Dao spread out, and the entire four-sided domain seemed to turn into Tian Fang's domain.Tian Fang's universe called bed also began to expand crazily. A level nine universe called bed universe was not limited to the native world. It could cover and expand crazily, suppressing the world!The stars were extremely bright!……Outside.Long Zhan and the others all felt the pressure. The world expanded, crazily swallowing and spitting out the power of the great DAOs and the power of Chaos. The great Dao universe expanded, and Tian Fang's suppressive force began to spread. All the cultivators in this area felt a threat. Tian Fang's experts could attack at any time!At this moment, in the tianfang realm, near the realm gate, a figure suddenly appeared, one after another.The leader was the radiant envoy.His voice was loud like the sound of the great Dao, spreading in all directions,""I am the heaven's light envoy! Tian Fang is the owner of this place, and anyone who comes is a guest. Whether it's a Dao discussion or an exchange, we welcome you to the extreme! If there's a villain who thinks that the heavens are easy to bully, the heavens are not afraid of any war!"The power of light spread out in all directions.It was like the incarnation of justice!At this moment, the radiant envoy continued,"the four-sided domain originally belonged to the tianfang domain, and tianfang was in charge!" Those who do not, you will be protected by the heavens and you can pay tributes!"As soon as he said this, some of the seventh rank venerable sovereigns around him felt more at ease.Oh, tribute!This was nothing.Long Zhan also had this request when he took over the four regions. Of course, the request was not high. One-tenth of the production of the great Dao universe. If the request was not high, within 30%... Everyone could actually accept it.It didn't matter who the boss was anyway, what did it have to do with them?All of a sudden ... The worried seventh-grade cultivators in the surroundings were relieved.While long Zhan was expressionless and did not make a sound.The people of Tian Fang were naturally not stupid.At this moment, there were still many high-level worlds in the square region. If they attacked the four regions, they would definitely be retaliated. However, at this moment, they only needed to say one word and those guys would not dare to resist.These humans were not reliable at all, and they could not be relied on.All around, the other great beings of the chaos race were extremely solemn.The waves of powerful auras attacked their thoughts.One or two ... A total of 12 auras of the eighth step. The feeling that the radiant envoy in front of them gave them ... Was probably not weaker than an existence at the level of a human King. It was suffocating.This ... Could the chaos race be a match for them?Previously, he had been excited ... But at this moment, his heart had turned cold.Even black Tiger, these powerhouses who were loyal supporters of long Zhan, also instantly felt their hearts turn cold ... How could there be so many?In the past, Tian Fang seemed to only have a few grade-8 cultivators.A million years later ... Even if they had returned, how could there be so many powerhouses? 12 rank eights!In the current chaos, even huntian's side only had four or five level eights under their direct command ... Of course, this was on the surface. Even if there were more in the dark, there shouldn't be that many.Was the level 9 world really that terrifying?Tian Fang had not returned yet!  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  At this moment, the radiant envoy looked at long Zhan, and his eyes flickered. Very strong ... Even if they did not fight, he could sense it. At this moment, the radiant envoy revealed a smile."You are long Zhan?"

Chapter 3595 Fearless Of Death (2)
Long Zhan was silent.The light envoy didn't mind."Before we returned, the Dao master said that if fellow Daoist long Zhan is willing to work for us, Tian Fang still lacks a chaos envoy!"He revealed a smile."Also, Daoist long Zhan, you don't have to worry. The Daoist master will be biased ... The dark Demon envoy, Coiling Dragon envoy, and I are not from tianfang. We joined halfway and are still free today!""Everything is changing. For millions of years, the only thing that hasn't changed is ... The heavens!""Fellow Daoist, you're a wise man. You should know what rank nine means. The chaos is huge, and the four-sided domain is only a small part of it. If you join us, you'll be able to achieve even greater things!"At this moment, long Zhan was only looking behind him, looking at the emerging Palace, looking at the boundless power of the great path.The tianfang Celestial Palace of the past.And now, it had appeared again.It was extremely majestic! Even from far away, one could clearly see the world that had just appeared, like a Fairyland.It was as if they had really returned to a million years ago.A million years ago, long Zhan had actually seen such a scene before. Previously, when he reversed time and space, he had even personally made a move ... Of course, to the light envoy, it might be a memory from a long time ago, but to him, it was only a moment ago.Just a moment ago, the five of them had joined forces and easily defeated the group of people in front of them.But now, this group of people had become his greatest enemy.Fate made a fool of him.Long Zhan was still calm,'since Tian Fang left, why did he still come back? The chaos was vast. Why ... Did he have to stay in this place? It's been a million years, and Tian Fang is no longer here. A million years, a million years, everything has changed ..."The radiant envoy laughed."This is tianfang's territory. As long as Dao master is still here, it will still be tianfang's territory even after hundreds of millions of years!" In the end, all of you are just passerby, people who are staying here. Now that the master has returned, shouldn't you return it?"Long Zhan did not say anything more either. He just looked at tianfang world silently.The spatial formation that had been fighting against the heavens seemed to be dissipating. The formation that had been maintained by the power of the great Dao was now being absorbed by this group of people.It had created a large number of experts!However, it was also because of this that the entire formation lost its effect. Of course, at this point, it did not matter if there was no formation. With 12 level 8s and close to 30 Level 7s, such strength was enough to sweep any side.Moreover, they were all old venerable sovereigns, not new venerable sovereigns, but they had all received ninth level teachings.He was not someone that ordinary newly-advanced venerable sovereigns could compare to.The radiant Envoy Group was a veteran rank eight in their early years, and their qualifications were much older than huntian.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  His control of power and his comprehension of the great Dao were both very deep.It definitely wasn't the kind of level eight that suddenly gained strength."Did you all come back just for the four-direction region?"At this moment, long Zhan opened his mouth once more and slowly said,""Tian Fang has been planning for so many years. Now, he's returning just for the four sides?"The radiant envoy laughed,"whether it is or not, it's tianfang's business. It has nothing to do with fellow Daoist!" I just want to ask, fellow Daoist, are you leaving or ... Are you staying?"Long Zhan smiled and did not speak either.He only took a step forward.In an instant, the atmosphere was extremely heavy. Long Zhan stepped on the air, his hair flying in the wind. His face was indifferent, and his smile disappeared.""That would depend on whether you ... Have the qualifications?"As soon as he finished speaking, he punched out!It was as if ten thousand Dragons were rising!The Dragon's Roar resounded through the heavens and earth.The Dragon Fist exploded and broke the sky.The light envoy's expression changed slightly. With a low growl, he also punched out. The God of Light fist appeared, and some of the onlooking powerhouses were slightly stunned ... This ... Seemed to be the light Thearch!Could the two be related?Although they were confused, at this moment, they were all very nervous. The domineering long Zhan had driven away the human King, the Silver Moon King, and everyone else. Now that he had returned, could he continue to be domineering?BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world.Near the realm gate, the radiant envoy took a few steps back, blood flowing out of his mouth. He was a little shaken. So strong!However, he was not weak either.He only fell back and was slightly injured.It wasn't too heavy.The next moment, a person appeared behind him. The power of darkness swept through the world as he smiled faintly."Light, join forces!""Alright!"The radiant envoy did not say much. The two of them joined hands. In an instant, light and darkness fused, and the sky collapsed!Tian Fang's venerable sovereigns were easier to fuse as they all came from the same source.In the entire tianfang great Dao universe, the light and dark stars seemed to have instantly fused together.The two of them were not long Zhan's match individually. Their strength was around 5000 Dao laws. With such strength, they would be top-tier existences even among stage eight existences. Furthermore, they were in their home ground, the home ground of tianfang world.His strength wasn't any weaker than the previous human King.As the two of them joined forces, light and darkness fused. The Dao of the two extremes exploded with shocking power in an instant.Long Zhan also gave a low roar and punched out once more!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated in all directions. The destructive force swept across the entire world. Some of the surrounding seventh rank venerable sovereigns fled quickly. Those who were slow were blown apart in an instant. Their bodies were crushed.Those who dared to watch had a little confidence, but it was instantly destroyed.The two emissaries of light and dark stepped back.Long Zhan, on the other hand, staggered slightly, his eyes somewhat cold and sharp.Black Tiger and the other eighth level venerable sovereigns were extremely heavy.Long Zhan, an invincible existence.But now ... He ... He could only barely suppress the light and dark messengers when they joined forces. After all, the other party also had the Yin Yang, life and death, and five elements messengers who could join forces.

Chapter 3596 Fearless Of Death (3)
This ... Made them feel a little hopeless.In their eyes, long Zhan was unrivaled in the world and could even compete with Tian Fang. But now ... It seemed like their fantasy was shattered.Long Zhan did not lose.In one exchange, he had suppressed the messenger of light and dark, who were both cultivators with 5000 Dao laws. Moreover, when the two of them joined forces, the power they unleashed was no less than that of a cultivator with 7000 Dao laws.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  This was the way of the two extremes.Under the fusion, he was extremely powerful. This was also Tian Fang's confidence. Even if he wasn't a Grade 9, Tian Fang's strength was something that others couldn't reach!However, not losing ... Was already a loss.He was the strongest in the chaos race, and also the most powerful in the East. Today, only two out of 12 type 8 powerhouses had taken action and stopped him. How could such strength suppress Tian Fang?"Dragon Lord!"The black Tiger roared and wanted to charge over. However, inside Tian Fang, many illusionary figures appeared. At this moment, some of them were cold and some of them were playful.Long Zhan!They were very strong. To be honest, the two envoys of light were already unbelievably strong when they joined forces. However, they were still suppressed by the other party. This was very terrifying. No wonder the Daoist master had warned them before they left.However ... He was strong, but not to the point of being ridiculous.It was difficult to suppress the two emissaries, but what about life and death?He could definitely suppress long Zhan easily!As for yin and yang, five elements, Coiling Dragon ... If these tier 8 experts joined forces, they could easily annihilate the other party.The Dao master had even asked them to seek help from the time cultivator or even the Dao chess ... Now it seemed that they had overestimated long Zhan. There was no need at all. They could even easily annihilate long Zhan themselves.Long Zhan did not speak either and just looked at them.After a long time, the radiant envoy opposite wanted to say something. Long Zhan suddenly said,""In order to recruit you, in order to create a group to fight against the tier 9, Tian Fang put in a lot of effort!"That's right, the existence of this group of people was actually to resist Grade 9!The five elements of life, death, light, and darkness!If these people joined forces, they might even be able to merge. There were even outsiders in this group. Clearly, the master of tianfang did not just want to recruit a few tier 8 experts. His ultimate goal was to be able to fight a tier 9 expert before they reached tier 9!That way, even without the support of a spirit, even if they couldn't reach the ninth step, Tian Fang cultivators could still dominate the world!Just like now.Of course, they were slightly weaker at the moment. It would be difficult for them to fight against a ninth-rank magical beast together. However, how many eighth-rank magical beasts could resist their joint attack?Long Zhan, who had 7000 Dao laws and was also a peak existence in the physical body Dao, could only barely suppress two of them!The radiant envoy laughed lightly,"long Zhan! You're even stronger than I expected. With the power of 7000 Dao laws and the powerful body of the Dragon race, there aren't many people in the world who can stop you, right? However, don't underestimate Tian Fang's Foundation! I've said it before, Dao master will give you a chance ..."But long Zhan revealed some smiles and said,""You guys are very strong ..." The radiant envoy frowned slightly.The next moment, long Zhan suddenly said,"but ... How can we possibly live in peace? As soon as you returned, I could already sense that the chaos great Dao ... Seemed to be losing its spirituality again. You are all devouring its spirituality!"Long Zhan's voice was not high. It was just that he was somewhat puzzled and doubtful."Why ... Why don't you nurture your own spirit? Li Hao can do it, but you ... Can 't? Tian Fang couldn't do it? Why must you devour the spirit of chaos? this way, our chaos race will be completely annihilated in the chaos sooner or later. Why ... Must you do this?"The radiant envoy frowned slightly.Yes, they were indeed extracting spirituality. Long Zhan could actually sense it!He frowned slightly, but before he could say anything, someone behind him sneered,""Nurturing your own spirit? How many years and months would that take? Now that the chaos's spirituality was weak, if he nurtured his own spirit, his lifespan might be exhausted when he grew up. Since the chaos had a spirit, why not extract it directly? Long Zhan, you're actually so childish!"The spirit of chaos was right in front of him. Why didn't he extract it?They even ran to nurture it themselves ... Let alone whether they could do it or not, even if they could, they knew very well how difficult it was to nurture the spirit of the great Dao. How long would it take?A million years?They were not young anymore!It didn't matter that people of their level had extremely long lifespans. However, they were already very old. Although the past million years had been silent, time had still passed. Time was not forbidden!If they didn't reach Grade 9, even they would die of old age!To not want something in front of him and run off to get it himself ... Wasn't this courting death?Long Zhan took a deep breath.That's true!At this moment, he didn't say anything more. There was nothing to say. There was only a tiny bit of hope before ...However, at this moment, he knew that he was just as the other party had said. He was too childish.If he could take it for free, why bother to get it himself? I shouldn't have asked this.That's good too, my hope has been completely destroyed.The spirit of chaos had only recovered a little after so many years. If it were to be extracted by these people, chaos might not be able to give birth to the chaos race in the future.Annihilate the clan!This wasn't a battle of Dao anymore. This was the extermination of an entire clan. They might not think so, but they were indeed doing so. Furthermore, they wouldn't mind.So what if the chaos race was gone? the chaos was so big and there were so many humans. So what if there was one less chaos race?"Roar!"At this moment, the chaos suddenly changed color, and countless chaotic forces roiled!Under everyone's shocked gazes, a 10000 Zhang Long Dragon appeared.

Chapter 3597 Fearless Of Death (3)
The Golden Dragon had nine claws.In the sky region, the expression in the eyes of the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor changed drastically. This ...The Dragon Emperor!Long Zhan would rarely reveal his true form. But today, he revealed his true form. In an instant, a Dragon's voice reverberated,""Tian Fang wants to exterminate my race. We won't rest until we die in this battle! The indestructible heaven's will, the endless chaos!""Follow me ... And kill!"BOOM!The giant dragon wagged its tail, causing the heavens to collapse and the earth to crack. In just an instant, its tail swept out, and the entire chaos seemed to be about to shatter.Long Zhan did not hesitate anymore. Killing them was the only way out.Boom! Boom! Boom!At this moment, Tian Fang's cultivators didn't expect this guy to be so decisive. He didn't even finish his words and he started killing.The messenger of light and dark, the messenger of life and death, the Four Masters appeared instantly and attacked at the same time!BOOM!The powerful power of the great Dao instantly erupted and swept across the world.Long Zhan was fighting one against four. At this moment, he was still incomparably strong. After returning to his original form, he seemed to be much stronger. One against four, he was still barely able to hold on. This scene caused the confidence of all the experts of the chaos race to increase greatly!Previously, it was already a little difficult for him to fight one against two. Now, he was fighting one against four, and it was still so ... As expected, the Dragon Lord was invincible!"Kill!"The roar of a Tiger, the cry of a Phoenix, and the eruption of the beasts. At this moment, the group of chaos beasts charged toward the sky. Red Moon sovereign also disappeared from the crowd and escaped into the void.……At the same time.Thunder region.At this moment, the lightning pillars were constantly changing. Among the thousands of lightning pillars, more than 20 lightning pillars appeared and turned into human figures. In an instant, they gathered together.Sensing the explosive aura of the square domain, one of the Thunder Giants suddenly laughed.""Long Zhan ... Is indeed very strong! However, Tian Fang is stronger. Even though he's fighting one against four, the experts under him are far inferior to Yin Yang and the others ..."At this moment, the two sides were engaged in a fierce battle, and their auras instantly soared to the sky.The huge fluctuation even swept into the Thunder region.However, from the looks of it, Tian Fang still had the advantage. The 12 Tier 8 experts were all very strong. If this continued, long Zhan would be defeated sooner or later."Ley, what should we do?""Plague ... Don't be anxious."Ray, the leader of this operation.They represented the calamity.There were plagues, Thunderbolts, landslides, and cracks in the earth ...These were all signs of disaster.There were also many experts in the Thunder region. Of course, they were not as good as Tian Fang, who was a true top-level great world in the past. They were slightly inferior, but there were several eighth level venerable sovereigns, and the rest were all seventh level.It was not as good as the top, but it was more than enough.At this moment, Supreme Thunder suddenly frowned,""Someone's here ... And he still dares to enter the Thunder region ... This is probably the neo martial art that the Daoist master mentioned?"One, two, three ...He felt the presence of many powerful people. The others were eager to fight, but ray suddenly smiled and said,"Avoid them and let them enter the four-direction region. Without them, perhaps long Zhan will be defeated very quickly ... This trip, we came out with two goals!" "First, strengthen the lightning territory and absorb enough spirit so that the Dao master can descend!"As long as one had enough spirituality, the Dao master could descend and maintain his strength.A ninth-grade Dao required spirituality to support it.The second ...He didn't say it, but everyone suddenly understood. Before they came, the Dao master had told them not to worry about Tian Fang. They weren't really family. Their second goal was to seize time!Yes, seizing time.Neo martial was not the master of time. At this moment, letting neo martial enter could instead allow both sides to maintain a balance. Otherwise, if Tian Fang won early, wouldn't it be troublesome for the Thunder region?He wanted them to continue the stalemate!The target of the lightning territory was actually Li Hao, the time cultivator.……The four directions shook.Suddenly, powerful auras passed through the lightning domain and charged toward the square domain, toward Tian Fang!The eyes of the long Zhan who was currently engaged in a fierce battle suddenly revealed some smiling intent.I knew it!Whether it's new martial or Silver Moon, whether it's against me or Tian Fang, they won't just sit back and do nothing. In fact, he's also waiting.As long as the war started, these people would definitely come.It doesn't matter if you help me or them ... It's the same.For the former, the opportunity had come.The latter was just destroyed earlier.There wasn't much difference.In the distance, the human King's laughter was overbearing and had a hint of playfulness.""Four-sided domain, I said that Tian Fang will return once it recovers!"His laughter reverberated through the heavens and earth!"Haha!" The human King laughed."The master of the four-sided domain should have the surname Fang!"At this moment, the radiant envoy suddenly shouted,""New martial arts?"  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  In the next moment, as if he sensed something, an extremely powerful light power burst out, and a loud shout resounded through the world,""Is it Minghao?"Minghao!Everyone was stunned. Who was it?……On new martial's side. The radiance Thearch seemed to be a little solemn and hesitant. Suddenly, when the radiant envoy shouted, he was stunned for a long time before he was a little shaken.On the side, the expressions of the few neo martial Supreme emperors changed slightly.Light Thearch's expression also changed slightly. He said in a low voice,"My real name is Minghao ..."Then, he looked into the distance and suddenly said,""That ... That radiant envoy ... Seems ... Seems to be the previous ... Previous Dao master of my radiant realm!"He wasn't the first Dao master.He wasn't young, he could even be considered very old. He was an experienced eighth level venerable sovereign of the square region. When he was young, he had once seen the radiant envoy.

Chapter 3598 Fearless Of Death (3)
However, he was too young at that time and did not really remember who the other party was.Today, he seemed to have realized that the light envoy that everyone was talking about ... Was actually the previous realm Lord of the light world.He really wasn't too sure about this.In his memory ... The other party seemed to have fallen.He looked around. At this moment, his expression changed. Would neo martial ... Do something because of this?He didn't know about this before he came.Yao yang and the other venerable sovereigns were also nervous.That light envoy was the previous realm Lord of our light world?They were relatively young and had not experienced Tian Fang's era, so they did not know about this. At this moment, Thearch Yao yang could not help but transmit a message."Big brother, that ... Is your father?"“……”The radiance Thearch was speechless.That's your father!"No! The previous sector Lord said that he had fallen, that's why I rose up later, but I've seen him once, my ... My god of light fist, it can be considered ... Originated from him!"Could he be considered a teacher?Not really, but in the past, he was also considered a genius of the younger generation in the realm. Therefore, he had won the favor of the other party and had once taught him the divine light fist!All of a sudden, the light Thearch had a headache.Before coming, the human King had already said that this trip was to deal with Tian Fang, but in the end ... How did I get involved with Tian Fang?As for the human King, he was overjoyed,"this is good news!" Old Guang, your opportunity is here! "A peak level eight radiant cultivator. I've always thought that there's no benefit for you to follow me. Your son is already at level eight, and you're still at level eight. You have around 3000 Dao laws. This is too tragic ... Kill him. He must have taken away a lot of radiant Dao source in the past. After combining it with the heavenly Dao source, you'll have a perfect fusion ... This time, there's hope for you to have 5000 Dao laws!"He was overjoyed!The light Emperor was stunned. 'This ... No, did you hear that?'I know him!He also knows me.We're from the same world, and he's the previous Dao master, I ...The human King roared,"what are you standing there for? go on! Let's beat him up!" "This time, I'll help old Guang. Those who hang out with our neo martial artists say that if you hang out with Silver Moon, you'll eat five meals a day. If you hang out with neo martial artists, you'll starve nine times a day. I'll be so embarrassed when I go out!""This time, we'll kill him and make a fortune. We'll also let little brother yaoyang enter level 8 ... We'll have some face!""Charge!"The human King roared, and the surrounding neo martial artists all roared,""Kill, kill him!""Old Guang, you're rich!"The light Thearch was still a little dazed when he was swept away by the crowd. He couldn't help but ask,""That was my previous Dao master ...""Your father?" The human King asked."No...""Your master?""No, he gave me some benefits ...""Then that's it. He's a guy who abandoned the world, which is equivalent to a traitor of light. He took away your Dao source of light and integrated it into his world. No wonder you, an old rank eight, are so weak! I'm afraid you're older than huntian, but you're in such a miserable state. The other party has cut off your bright path, or else you'd be at least at the peak of the eighth step. What else do you have to consider?"Oh, it seems so!The light Thearch wasn't stupid, but ... The human King's words made him ... A little embarrassed. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  He was the previous generation's Dao master. It seemed normal for him to run away and take away a large amount of Dao sources. I even threw away the world of light. Am I a traitor?However ... After hearing what the human King said, it seemed to make sense.That's right, he betrayed the world of light. Otherwise, the upper limit of light would not be so limited. He was an old venerable sovereign, but he only had more than 3000 great path nomological laws, which was not as good as many people.He hesitated for a moment. The next moment, he looked at Yao yang and the others. Yao yang gritted his teeth and shouted,"Kill the traitor of the light! Kill!"Do it!I don't know that person, but I know you. This time, after killing him, I ... Can enter the eighth rank!Why are you thinking so much!"Boss, kill him. Even if you don't think about yourself, you have to think about the sacred central crypt. He cultivates both light and darkness, but the power of light and darkness is not enough. Not enough. Now ... Look at Tian Fang, he has the light and dark messengers!"This sentence seemed to have touched the light Thearch.That's right!It doesn't matter if I'm old, but my son is still young. He's a peerless genius who's a thousand years old and has reached the three extremes of the six paths. But now, after entering the eighth step, I'm afraid he'll have a very difficult process of improvement.The power of light and darkness was far from enough.Even if it wasn't for himself, he had to consider his son.As for the previous Dao master who had taught him the divine fist of light, there were many people who knew it back then. Besides, it was the other party who had betrayed the light first ...After comforting himself, the light Thearch no longer spoke any more nonsense. His power of light burst out and he roared,""You traitor? You abandoned the divine light realm and extracted countless power to make me, mumian, almost perished, cutting off the hope of my world ... You still dare to show yourself! Traitors must be killed!"The radiant envoy was slightly stunned and his face changed!Damn it!Originally, he thought that if he met the current generation's Lord of Light, he might be able to get some help. Even if it didn't work, he would at least make neo martial turbulent. In the end ... Good fellow, he suddenly arranged for himself to be labeled as a heinous criminal.Traitor!This ... It seemed like there was no way to refute it.The first generation's path master had abandoned the world and taken away a large amount of power of light, weakening the strength and even potential of the entire world ... It didn't seem to be a problem for the current generation's path master to scold him.

Chapter 3599 Fearless Of Death (3)_6
But ...And you?Didn't you also lose the World of light? he can't even sense the existence of the world of light!You have the nerve to say that?He didn't have time to think too much. Over there, the neo martial artists were moving extremely fast. The human King held a big blade and slashed at them from a distance. He was extremely crazy and shouted savagely,""Kill, kill the light and dark emperors and help old light obtain the origin!""Kill!""Kill!",m A group of venerable sovereigns roared one after another. They were much more enthusiastic and crazy than the chaos race. Those who didn't know would think that this battle was started by the new martial artists.Some of the venerable sovereigns from the chaos race were shocked.Suddenly, Black Panther, Feng Yan, Qing Qiu and the others all started to roar madly!Their fighting spirit was not even as strong as a group of outsiders!This group of people were all screaming and shouting. They seemed to be even angrier, more impulsive, and more crazy than them.This ... This was neo martial!The human King rushed over and slashed at the messenger of light and dark with his long saber. He roared,"Light and dark, yin and yang, they're all mine. Neo martial will kill the four Emperors. As for the rest, you guys do it!"At this moment, long Zhan laughed out loud," Good!"At this moment, he suddenly realized that the neo martial King was so arrogant that it was a little ... Cute."If you're his enemy, you really hate his madness. He's extremely Savage and crazy in every battle. You'll have a huge headache and even want to vomit blood.However, when the neo martial King stood on his side ...This lunatic had immediately taken four extremely difficult bones.An ordinary person, even if they were reinforcements, would not immediately bite the hard bone. But the other party ... Had directly asked for these four people!This was the best teammate!The neo martial human King slashed with his saber and split the battlefield. He laughed wildly."Leave the light and dark to me. Old Zhang, you bring people to kill Yin Yang. Besides me, new martial, who dares to be called Yin Yang?"On the other side, the Supreme martial artist laughed and walked in the air. The book of great Dao appeared and his voice was cold,""Emperors of neo martial, follow me to kill these two. As long as neo martial exists, who dares to call themselves yin and yang?"This was the exclusive property of neo martial!He was just so overbearing!Even if Tian Fang's yin-yang Messenger had existed a million years ago, it wouldn't do. You have to change your name. If you don't change it, you'll die!The two messengers of yin and yang were also strong. They were originally chasing after Red Moon sovereign, but at this moment, their expressions changed.So overbearing!This group of extremely young people were actually so overbearing, even more overbearing than him, Tian Fang ...There was actually such a person in the chaos.The term 'yin and yang' is not exclusive to you.They were known as the Yin Yang envoys, and even the true Yin Yang path master had no objections. Yet ... They actually had objections?"BOOM!"However, they were not given a chance to speak. In an instant, a loud explosion was heard. The group of neo martial Supreme emperors threw out a huge energy bomb one by one.The entire space instantly trembled. To a grade eight, this didn't really matter and had almost no effect.But ... Neo martial didn't seem to pursue the effect. At this moment, a fiery light burst out. The next moment, the whole fire suddenly reflected something. Yes, at this moment, the fire seemed to illuminate the chaos!An extremely huge mirror was thrown out of the divine creator's hand!In an instant ... The human King's figure appeared.It illuminated the heavens!At this moment, the entire battlefield seemed to fall silent.The human King's voice resounded through the heavens and earth as he laughed maniacally,""How can one person enjoy slaying a heaven-defying monster all to himself! I'm going to announce to the universe and all the cultivators in the chaos that I'm ... Unparalleled!"The long saber reflected the heavens and earth!He slashed at the radiant envoy, and the huge mirror projected the image in all directions!“……”Long Zhan was stunned. This ... What was this?This new martial human King was really too ... Too flashy!It was the first time he had met such an existence, such a cultivator, such ... Was he shameless or not?He didn't know!He only knew that the new martial arts 'venerable sovereign actually ... Actually supported it. In order to flatter him, he had asked a seventh level venerable sovereign to personally forge a sovereign weapon. At this moment, he didn't even participate in the battle. Instead, he maintained the projection of the mirror!The huge projection covered the entire square region in an instant!That divine Smith seemed to be very excited and was looking at his own results. The huge mirror was still madly expanding its projection range. It seemed to have sensed something and suddenly turned around to look at the huge Dragon."Senior long Zhan ... Do you want me to project it for you to show off your might? as long as you have 100 million great Dao crystals, it will last for half an hour.
