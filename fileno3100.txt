These thoughts flashed through his mind ... Or perhaps, through the space Star in front of him, he might be able to have a conversation with a powerful existence that had disappeared?And then ... Owe the other party a favor?A favor from a tier 9!Just for a few great Dao crystals ... He might be killed?Li Hao glanced at the star of the great path. Previously, he had sensed that he was being spied on, so when he came here, he had always felt that he was being spied on. But if he had really been spied on by the master of tianfang, would he have been able to sense it so easily?The thought emerged once again.Li Hao took a deep breath. The next moment, he stepped out of the Dao universe.The great Dao universe fluctuated. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He had entered tianfang world.Li Hao, on the other hand, ignored everyone else. The time and space Stars floated in front of him, freezing all the Taoist connotation phantoms that blocked him. He stepped into the sky and headed straight for the realm gate.……Outside the world.The three grade 8 experts were all very nervous.The radiant sovereign couldn't help but be nervous, while the other two rank eights were itching to try.At this moment, a realm gate suddenly opened.A person walked out of Tian Fang.Everyone looked at Li Hao, who had just walked out. Red Moon master's face was instantly filled with anger, and his eyes were somewhat cold. He recognized this person. It was the Silver Moon King. That day, it was also this person who had broken through the red moon great Dao universe and dismantled the core of his great Dao, forcing him to strip it off!"You dare to come out?"At this moment, Red Moon master's aura fluctuated, and her might shook the world.Li Hao didn't panic. He pointed behind him."At this moment, Daoist Kong Ji is in danger. We are trying to find a way to save him ... The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns are not really helpless. They just don't want to fight back, causing the resistance of the entire world to grow stronger and stronger ... However, if you dare to attack, the radiant master is here. If the red moon Emperor thinks that you and the cloud Master can stop the four seventh rank ... No, five seventh rank and one eighth rank, then attack me!"Red Moon Lord's eyes were extremely cold!"I'm here to make a deal with you ... To save Kong Ji!"Li Hao said.As soon as these words came out, the radiant sovereign couldn't help but feel a little speechless. He said in a low voice,""Let me in. With me here, no problem will be a problem!" Li Hao looked at the radiant sovereign."The backlash of a world can be large or small. We didn't expect this ... Right now, the apparition of the sky Fang master hasn't appeared yet. Once it does, senior radiant will probably suffer a backlash as well!" At that time, I'll be harming brother Kong Ji. These two and the experts hiding in the dark will also see an opportunity ..."The radiant sovereign frowned slightly. I don't care!The person inside was his own son.Do I need you to remind me?He knew very well what kind of consequences he would have to face.However, at this moment, his son seemed to be done for. This was the real trouble.Li Hao continued,"as I said, I want to make a deal with you, seniors ... Including the radiant sovereign!" Actually, brother emptiness doesn't want to always rely on the divine light realm. After all, the divine light realm doesn't belong to the radiant Thearch alone. It belongs to everyone in the divine light realm. "Just as Red Moon was about to speak, Li Hao interrupted her and quickly said,""This time, all the Taoist connotation has appeared, which has both advantages and disadvantages! Everyone has seen the disadvantages, but there are also benefits!""Don't you find it strange that I can open the tianfang great Dao universe at will?"Everyone's hearts trembled, and red Moon master laughed coldly. "You've obtained some of Tian Fang's inheritance, so you can naturally open it. Do you still need to ask?"Li Hao nodded."Senior, you have sharp eyes!" He quickly said.Red Moon Lord felt that he was mocking her. It was such a simple question. Was there a need to be wise?Did he really treat a level eight venerable sovereign as an idiot?"Today, all the Taoist connotation has emerged. With the help of the source of the world, it has recovered for a short time!"Li Hao quickly said,"everyone knows that tianfang universe is destroyed. I can understand that senior Red Moon wants to kill us, but not everyone only cares about killing us. Some people care more about opening tianfang universe and reviving it!" "To the cloud heaven Thearch, to those seventh-rank Masters, and even to senior Hong Yue, a resurrected ninth-rank universe is what everyone is after! Now, while the Dao accumulations are temporarily recovering ... If everyone is willing to help, suppress all these Dao accumulations phantoms and input them into the corresponding stars of the tianfang great Dao universe one by one, it can speed up the recovery of the entire universe!"Red Moon master laughed coldly."You want to use us to solve the crisis and revive tianfang universe?" You've got a good plan, and you dare to think about it!""That's indeed my intention!"Li Hao nodded.He looked at everyone and said,'I can now open up tianfang universe and occupy tianfang world. This is the basis of the deal! Otherwise, if I didn't let you in, would you really attack now?""If I don't open the tianfang universe, even if you guys defeat the apparition of the Taoist connotation, can you revive the stars?" he laughed."Let's Make a Deal ... Everyone will enter tianfang world one by one and destroy those powerful Dao accumulation phantoms. I will help you project the power of the Phantoms into the corresponding stars ... When the stars appear and recover, you can move the stars into your own great Dao universe. This way, the Dao Masters may have the opportunity to open tianfang universe, or even ... Recover it!"

Chapter 3101 A Missed Opportunity (3)
He moved the corresponding great Dao stars of the tianfang universe into his own great Dao universe.From there, he might have the opportunity to open tianfang universe at any time.At this moment, the cloud Master frowned slightly, while the light master's eyes flickered, as if he understood what Li Hao meant.""The great Dao stars will be moved into our great Dao universe ... We've considered it before, but the stars can't be revived. They can only be revived in tianfang. Do you mean that this time, we can use the Dao accumulation Phantom to revive the stars and take them away?""Yes!" Li Hao nodded."You're not allowed to enter together, but one by one?""Yes,"Li Hao looked at the God of Light and said with a smile,""How is it? Of course, the first person to try could choose the projection of a rank eight venerable sovereign and project it into a rank eight star of the great path. The more powerful it was, the greater the chance! The Phantom was just a Phantom. Although it was strong, a seventh rank venerable sovereign could completely suppress it! I'll have revered sword and the others work with you ... If the apparition of the master of the square appears in the end, I can even send a few tier 8 experts in to suppress the apparition and directly revive the spatial Dao origin!""However, before the apparition of the master of Tian Fang appears, we can only enter one by one. Is there anyone willing to go in and try?"The light master's mouth moved slightly. Just as he was about to speak, Red Moon master sneered."Who would fall for your trick? "Enter one by one. You four are seventh level venerable sovereigns. Once you seal off the great Dao universe and trap us inside, we'll surround you with four of us. Whoever enters will die! Silver Moon King, do you still want to use this move to kill our fellow Daoists?"Li Hao shook his head, if I did that, Kong Ji would be dead! Not only Kong Ji, but the Silver Moon monarchs will also be killed! "To me, whether it's empty solitude or Silver Moon, they're all more important than killing a level 7 or level 8 ... If not for that, I wouldn't have invested all the resources of the four worlds and tens of billions of great Dao crystals into Silver Moon after breaking through Red Moon! Silver Moon has given birth to more than 30 venerable sovereigns at an extremely fast speed. It's not hard to imagine how much it has cost me. How could I, Li Hao, do something that would harm others without benefiting myself just to kill one or two level Seven venerable sovereigns?""Of course, if the red moon Lord enters, perhaps ... I will really do so!"Li Hao laughed."Time is limited. If we really can't hold on any longer, I'll close the Dao universe and let the four level-Sevens attack by force to break the current stalemate. Kong Ji will die for sure ... Senior Light, I can only say sorry!""I'm going in first ..." Light Thearch frowned slightly."I'll be the trial tester!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "That won't do. Senior has a close relationship with us, so no one will believe you. Is there anyone willing to give it a try? Silver Moon would not have offended any other high level venerable sovereigns other than Red Moon master for no reason!"Red Moon master's face was cold!"Is there really no one who is willing to obtain such an opportunity?"Li Hao spoke again.At this moment, a seventh rank venerable sovereign walked out of the darkness. He was a little hesitant, but he knew that the first person to try might not be in too much danger. The man walked out hesitantly, but he quickly said,""I'm willing to give it a try! Silver Moon King, according to what you said, when I enter, venerable the sword and the others will work with me to suppress the Dao apparition of a Tian Fang Emperor. You will project it into the corresponding star of the great Dao universe, and I can take this star away, right?" "Right!""Tianfang universe?" the rank seven master was solemn."Can we open tianfang universe at any time after we take it away?""It should be possible ..." Li Hao said after some thought."The premise is that you can comprehend some of the Outlander Dao. Before the corresponding Outlander power in the star is completely consumed, you can definitely activate it at any time!""Because that's what I did!"The rank 7 Lord took a deep breath and made a decision.The bold die from overeating, the timid die from hunger!There was no harm in trying!Who wouldn't covet the tianfang universe?"I want to enter ..." He said in the next moment,"besides, even if I want to suppress the eighth-ranked Phantom, you'll help me?""Right!""Silver Moon King ... I hope you won't do anything else ..."The seventh level venerable sovereign was still a little afraid. He said in a deep voice,""We, the level Seven Worlds, rarely participate in the competition between powerful worlds like neo martial, Red Moon, cloud sky, and the light world. Therefore, in the chaos, neo martial's enemies are only those level eight worlds. If you dare to plot against us ... Perhaps something will happen to me, but neo martial will lose the trust of all the chaos Worlds ... At that time, you will lose a big loss because of a small gain!"Li Hao chuckled."How can that be? is there really no trust in the chaos?" Today, I'm also trying to solve the crisis. If you really suppress all the Taoist connotation phantoms, we can also get billions of great Dao crystals near the source of the world. It's a win-win situation! Besides, I, Silvermoon, am the master of this place, not neo martial!"He spoke again,"seniors, my name is Li Hao, and I'm also the Silver Moon King that you all call ... Today, I'm not lying!" "I may be weak, but what I say in public can't be false. This is the first time you're making a deal with me. You may be worried, but in the future, you'll get used to it. I've always kept my word!"The seventh level venerable sovereign raised his brows slightly. His words were all nonsense. No one would believe him easily.

Chapter 3102 A Missed Opportunity (1)
But ... It was worth a try! If it really didn't work, he could counterattack, and he might not necessarily die."Alright, I'll give it a try ... Li Hao, I hope we'll have the chance to work together in the future!"The other party was very afraid of being given a sweet date, but he still tore through the void and headed straight for the realm gate. Behind him, Red Moon master sneered."In the primordial chaos, if you believe the words of your enemy ... You will die a terrible death sooner or later!"Li Hao's face was calm."If you don't believe anyone's words, you might end up like you, senior. Not only will you lose the World, but you'll also become a laughingstock. You'll also be easily hunted down by new martial artists!"Red Moon sovereign's killing intent exploded!He went straight for Li Hao!Li Hao retreated into the realm gate."I'm no match for you ... But you want to kill me ... Not yet. You messed up my plan and killed Kong Ji. Be careful, or Senior Light will kill you at all costs!""You've offended the new martial artists and then the light. A level eight itinerant cultivator is indeed terrifying ... But you've also ruined the plans of all the level Seven and level eight venerable sovereigns here. You'll die a terrible death!"Red Moon master's eyes were cold!He looked around for a long time, then laughed coldly and didn't speak again.He wanted to see ... Would this fellow really let the others succeed?Now, only Li Hao had the method to open tianfang universe. This was the initiative. If everyone didn't give up on tianfang, they wouldn't be able to open tianfang universe at any time. If everyone could open it ... Tianfang world would instantly become the target that all experts would fight for!Even if it had not recovered yet!Could Li Hao bear to do that?Would he be willing to give up the current good situation just to save Kong Ji and some weak Silver Moon venerable sovereigns?He didn't believe it!As for the great Dao crystals near the source of the world ... Even a fool would know which one to choose between a level-nine universe and less than 10 billion great Dao crystals!Li Hao's goal was definitely not these Dao crystals!As he was thinking, the rank seven master had already entered the realm gate nervously.And nearby was venerable the sword!The rank seven master was very alert and nervous. Venerable the sword looked at him and said coldly,""What are you looking at? Which Phantom do you want to seize? choose quickly!"The rank seven master's expression turned cold. He didn't say anything and glanced at the dark Demon Ridge not far away. At that moment, light and darkness combined and unleashed a Dao domain to suppress experts."I want the shadow Messenger!""Then I'll hold the light apparition back and suppress the Tao domain. Although the shadow of the dark Messenger has the pressure of an eighth-rank, its actual power is only at the seventh-rank. You're the master of the seventh-rank, so you can definitely suppress it if you go all out!" Venerable the sword said directly."Alright!" The venerable sovereign didn't say much.When Sword saint's longsword exploded, the sword domain appeared and tangled with the light Dao domain. The longsword went straight for the light Illusion. His eyes moved slightly. He had been extremely vigilant, but he also went straight for the dark Demon Ridge. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The powerful pressure of a tier 7 being burst out instantly, and a dark force swept across the entire world!BOOM!The shadow of the shadow Messenger and the rank 7 Lord started fighting, and the whole world shook. After all, it was just a projection. Soon, the rank 7 Lord seized the opportunity and roared. With a loud boom, the powerful Dao River suppressed the shadow and trapped it!At this moment, Li Hao stretched out his hand and pointed. The universe of the great path opened, and a star appeared. Li Hao shouted,""It's that one. If you put the power of the dark emissary into it, senior can take this star away!""You want to enter the Dao universe?"The master of the seventh step was a little nervous. Li Hao replied,""Of course, I can't suppress the power of a stage seven. Otherwise, there's no need for senior to make a move ... Now, I can only rely on senior to seal the power of a stage seven into it!" Duan Ling Tian said.A battle between heaven and man!The seventh level venerable sovereign was at a loss. Although he had been prepared for this, he was still a little afraid when he saw the dark Dao universe. What if Li Hao closed the Dao universe once he entered?Then wouldn't I be finished?"When they leave, the four tier 7 experts will enter and surround me ... I'll definitely die!Li Hao said helplessly,"then I'll go in first, but it's useless even if I go in. I can come out at any time and open it at any time ... I can't be a hostage ... Senior, if you're worried about the danger, you can give up!"The rank 7 master hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth and deciding to give it a try!The next moment, it swept up the power of the dark Envoy and went straight to the great path universe. In an instant, it flew near a huge star and threw the power of the dark Envoy's Taoist connotation into it. That star instantly flashed with a dark light.This rank seven master couldn't care about anything else. With a roar, the Dao River appeared and swept across the entire star!The next moment, he nervously dragged the entire star and flew out of the great Dao universe. He was extremely nervous, fearing that Li Hao would seal the great Dao universe.When he flew out, his back was drenched in sweat. To a rank 7 master, this was unbelievable!But he ... Was only ecstatic at this moment.He didn't say anything. His own Dao universe was opened. When the star was flickering, a Dao universe suddenly opened and forcefully suppressed the star!The moment the star was suppressed into the universe of the great path ... His heart stirred. At that moment, he was ecstatic. He seemed to have sensed some connection with tianfang universe.He might not be able to control it at the current stage.However, if he was given some time, he could completely sense some of the ways of the secret agents and open tianfang universe at will!

Overjoyed, he flew straight for the realm gate. As he flew, he observed the four level Seven venerable sovereigns with a grave expression. No one stopped him even after he flew out of the realm gate and entered the primal Chaos.In the next moment, in his ecstasy, he suddenly burrowed into a great Dao universe and escaped without saying a word!“……” Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Powerful venerable sovereigns suddenly appeared in the surroundings. Some of them moved their eyes, and some of them quickly transmitted their voices,""The star of the dark emissary ... Was taken by him?""Nonsense, didn't you see?""This ... Damn it ... Looking at this guy, maybe ... He can really open tianfang universe!""Last time, the stars were dead, so it was useless to take them away. This time, I can use the power of the Dao accumulation shadow to seal them directly. Even if I can't open them infinitely, I can open them one or two times ... One or two times is enough!"It was useless to open it every day.At critical moments, it would be enough to open it once or twice.At this moment, several rank seven venerable sovereigns suddenly walked out and looked at each other. One of them was anxious and quickly said,""Silver Moon King, this King is willing to enter!"Li Hao said,"one by one!" If we enter together, I'm worried that you'll attack in the realm ... First come, first served. Level eight or Level Seven is actually the same. It's just to open the great Dao universe, not to really comprehend the great Dao ..."Then, he pointed at a venerable sovereign and said,""This senior appeared first, so you do it!"The rank seven venerable sovereign didn't say anything and charged toward the realm gate.After his first attempt, he couldn't care about anything else. The moment he entered, he didn't stare at the illusory figure of the radiant envoy, because the venerable sword was suppressing it. Once he took action and dealt with the illusory figure of the radiant envoy, the venerable sword would be completely released.That would be too dangerous!He went straight to forest orchid master and said,""I want the Dao projection of the yin Dao envoy!""That's only a seventh-rank ..."Li Hao said."That's enough!"The rank seven venerable sovereign did not care at all. He only thought that he could not let venerable sword unseal himself completely."Senior Sen LAN, help him!" Li Hao nodded.The Senlan realm Lord didn't say anything more. He exploded out with his power, sending the Asura hell towards the emissary's projection. As for the other rank 7 realm Masters, they only needed to suppress one of the rank 7 venerable Emperor's projection.This time, the speed was even faster, and soon, another shadow was suppressed!Li Hao also showed his opponent the stars of the great path and repeated the previous routine. The other party suppressed the power of his Taoist connotation into the stars. Overjoyed, he took the stars out of the great path universe and quickly absorbed the stars of Yin into his own great path universe.At the same time, he also sensed something and was overjoyed!He could really open tianfang universe! After two venerable sovereigns had tried, the others couldn't help it.Even cloud Master couldn't hold it in anymore. He glanced at Red Moon master and transmitted a message."Hongyue ... It's too dangerous for you to go in. If I go in ... Do you think they'll choose to fight to the death to keep me, or ..."He was a little worried, because he and Hong Yue both had a grudge against the people inside.Red Moon master's eyes were cold. She thought about it and said,""If you and I ... Enter separately, if one side is in trouble and the other is willing to go all out to save the other, there is still hope of taking a star!"At this moment, he could no longer say that he did not care.With a star, he would have the right to open tianfang universe. As the master of the great Dao, he actually knew and understood this.This was because tianfang universe had been destroyed. It had no master and no master to control it. These high-stage venerable sovereign stars of the great Dao could definitely be activated. If it wasn't for the fact that they couldn't charge these stars last time, they would have done so long ago.But the last time, it was a waste to take him away.This time, it was different. All the Taoist connotation had been restored under the effect of the origin of the world.While they were hesitating, seventh rank venerable sovereigns appeared one after another. Without further ado, they entered the place and began to suppress the seventh rank illusionary figures, taking away the stars.One star after another was taken away.At this moment, venerable the sword sent a voice transmission to Li Hao, I should be able to suppress the projection of the radiant envoy. Should I not let these people in ... Or ... Wait for Red Moon and the others to enter and kill them? "Don't ... Let them take the stars away!"Li Hao sent a voice transmission, although these stars have been destroyed, they might not be dead!What did that mean?Venerable the sword was lost in thought. Li Hao seemed to have deliberately allowed these experts to take away the stars of the great Dao of the powerful venerable sovereigns.At that moment, the advanced venerable sovereigns of tianfang world were being taken away."These stars ... Can they really open the tianfang universe?""Yes, with the power of heaven, anyone who can comprehend a great Dao will be a genius. Otherwise, they won't be able to become a rank 7 master ... I won't say much, but I can still open it a few times."Wouldn't that be giving Tian Fang to someone else?Sword Saint was a little confused, but he didn't ask anymore.Tianfang world was also seized by Li Hao. Since Li Hao doesn't care about it, why should we care?At this moment, the rank seven venerable sovereigns attacked continuously.The Dao accumulation phantoms of the entire tianfang world were taken away one by one ... The origin of the world seemed to be a little anxious and wanted to fight back, but it was useless. Every level Seven Phantom could suppress one, so counterattacks were of little use.

Chapter 3104 A Missed Opportunity (8)
As these phantoms were suppressed, the origin of the world trembled endlessly, and even reviving the entire world was somewhat difficult.As for Kong Ji and the others, they were all panting.The pressure was not as great as before!However, as they watched the experts take away tianfang's great path stars, they felt a little reluctant, regretful, and painful, as if their treasures had been taken away.Even Kong Ji couldn't help but curse. Why couldn't you just ask my father to give you one billion great Dao crystals?Why did he hand over the control of tianfang universe?"This way, when the Masters of great DAOs are familiar with the Tian Fang Dao and can open it, we won't be able to occupy the Tian Fang anymore. In a few years at most, a month or two at least, these people will definitely be able to comprehend great DAOs!Haoyue, what are you thinking?At this moment, in the midst of the chaos, the God of Light coughed softly.""Um ... Can I enter?"I watched as everyone obtained a star, but I haven 't.I'm going to save my son, okay?How about I also take one of the stars?At this moment, he suddenly felt a little embarrassed ... As the old father of the sacred central crypt, he had been thinking of ways to save his son ... In the end, the other party didn't need it. An outsider was thinking of ways to save his son, and he even gave up the control of the entire tianfang universe ... He had to admit that he was very embarrassed as a father.Now, he wanted to take away a star for himself ... This was too embarrassing!Li Hao nodded."Sure ... But it's best for senior yaoyang to go in and take one. As for senior Guangming ... Keep an eye on senior Hongyue. Otherwise, someone might be jealous and attack Tian Fang!"Red Moon sovereign's eyes were extremely cold!Li Hao, however, was fearless. He looked at Red Moon Emperor and sneered."Everyone can take it, but you can 't! You don't have a Dao universe. If you take it and don't leave, I won't be able to deal with you!""You!"Red Moon master was furious, but Li Hao was extremely calm.""Even Emperor Yunxiao can take one ... Because he still has an eighth-tier universe. Before he's sure, he won't risk keeping it there. You're different ... So, don't even think about it!"Red Moon Lord was furious, but he could not vent his anger. He could not even feel it ... For a moment, he was in a complicated mood.As for venerable Emperor Yunxiao, he was deep in thought.In that case ... In order to ensure that we can enter tianfang universe, the Crimson Moon will cooperate with me and take one of the stars?Not bad!Otherwise, if he gave it to venerable Emperor Red Moon, this fellow might really stay in tianfang universe and not leave.At this moment, as the venerable sovereigns continued to enter ...The Dao apparitions of the entire tianfang world were being suppressed one by one.One star after another was taken away.  Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Even the brilliant sun Thearch had entered it to suppress the radiant envoy and release the sword venerable. The other party was not too afraid. After all, Kong Ji was still here. He just took away a bright star with some embarrassment.Seeing that Kong Ji wasn't in as much danger as before ... He smiled awkwardly and quickly ran away with Xingchen. It was very awkward.Our Son of God of light is in danger, and we still have to rely on outsiders to pay the price to save him ... If this gets out, it'll be so embarrassing!More importantly, big brother even let me take away bright star, which is even more embarrassing!……At this moment, Li Hao was staring at the Dao universe. As a large number of stars were taken away, the entire Dao universe became more and more silent.He cast his gaze towards the space Star in the deepest part of the void. He smiled and didn't say anything."This time ... I don't owe you anything.……At the same time.Deep in the chaos.​ The giant statue with its eyes opened seemed to be able to see everything, and after a long moment, it began to laugh."Interesting! The cultivators of time ... Are all so interesting ..."The next moment, he closed his eyes and stopped looking.He had thought that this would be a good opportunity, but it seemed like ... He would have to wait a little longer.Have you noticed?It was not bad!However, was it not a pity to give up the opportunity to control a level-nine universe?If you cooperate this time ... Perhaps, you can completely control tianfang universe. If you knew, would you still be so calm?He really wanted to know, if this person knew all of this ... Would he regret it?At this moment, she even had the urge to communicate with him and tell him that what he gave up was not just some Taoist connotation, but also the entire tianfang universe!"If you're willing to cooperate with me this time, I might tell you how to completely revive Tian Fang and how to control Tian Fang. You'll reach the heavens in a single bound!This thought appeared in his mind, but was quickly suppressed.Forget it!The world in his eyes completely disappeared, no longer spying.'If I give up this opportunity, it might take a very long time for the other party to see me!'

Chapter 3105 The World's Recovery (1)
After sending away the seventh rank venerable sovereigns, the Taoist connotation's shadows in the entire tianfang world instantly decreased by a large amount.The Grade 7 and Grade 8 illusionary figures were almost completely gone.The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns were all released.At that moment, only the source of the world was left. The projection of the Daoist Coiling Dragon did not need anyone else's help. It was too easy for four seventh rank venerable sovereigns to deal with a seventh rank venerable sovereign projection.However, at this moment, there were still people who had not obtained it.Venerable sovereign Yunxiao's expression changed.Everyone else had gotten it, including the two venerable sovereigns Chi Yang and Dragon Lord. They had also sent seventh level venerable sovereigns over to take a star. Only he and Hong Yue had been hesitating and thinking about it ... Until now, they were the only ones who didn't have one.The others had obtained the right to freely enter and leave tianfang universe, but they didn 't.At this moment, the other party spoke."Silver Moon King!" Thearch Yunxiao's expression turned serious."I want the apparition of the Coiling Dragon Thearch!""No need!"Li Hao appeared near the realm gate. He looked at him and sneered."I didn't say anything before, but I don't need it now. Even eating sh * t can't keep up with the heat!"Supreme Emperor Yunxiao looked at him coldly with a gloomy expression.It was indeed a little late.The four rank seven venerable sovereigns were released.Besides, there were also venerable sovereign radiance and venerable sovereign brilliant sun here. Even if he attacked by force, he and Hong Yue would not be able to deal with these people.p He was a little regretful.If he had known earlier, he would have requested to enter earlier ... Now, even if Li Hao allowed him to enter, he would be somewhat worried that he would be besieged, killed, and trapped in the universe of the great path.At this moment, Red Moon sovereign said coldly,""Li Hao, if you don't let us take one, the sacred central crypt is still in the nihilated world. The crisis is not completely resolved yet. The projection of the master of tianfang may appear at any time ... It's easy for Yunxiao and I to cause some damage!"Li Hao slightly frowned and coldly glanced at him.A level five venerable sovereign was not afraid of a level eight venerable sovereign.After a moment of silence, Li Hao said, sure, 10 billion great Dao crystals! I'll let sovereign Yunxiao in ... Otherwise, don't even think about it. ""You want to ... Charge me?" Thearch Yunxiao frowned.What a joke! None of the seventh level venerable sovereigns had asked for money, and Li Hao had even offered to help. But now ... He was asking for a fee?Li Hao was extremely calm,"that's right!" Previously, there were many seventh rank venerable sovereigns. I was worried that if you attacked, it would cause a riot! Now, they're gone. Even if they didn't leave, they've got the stars of the great path and won't join you in your dirty business. In that case, why should I be afraid of you? Why did he let the enemy have the right to enter and leave tianfang universe? As for the destruction caused by you and red Moon master ... At most, we'll give up on Tian Fang. I'll contact Neo martial and focus on dealing with you, Yunxiao. At this time, the experts in the chaos are all comprehending Tian Fang's Dao. Who has the time to deal with you? I can't wait to have two less competitors, and they're extremely powerful competitors!""The third party will benefit from the battle between the Sandpiper and clam. Do you think those rank 7 Masters will join you to deal with us?""The best result is ... We die together!"Li Hao looked at the two of them and said, you're one step too late! You're the ones who are too hesitant. Since that's the case, you'll have to pay the price if you want to get it! I've paid so many stars of the great path so that the other seventh level venerable sovereigns won't help you deal with us ... On the contrary, they now want you to lose the right to enter and leave. Who will help you?"The two level eight venerable sovereigns 'eyes turned cold when they heard this.That was true. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The two of them were both at the eighth level. The seventh-level cultivators had wanted them to be the vanguard, but now ... They could enter and leave after taking away the great path stars. At this time, they wished that all the eighth-level cultivators were dead, and they wished that none of them could enter.Otherwise, the chances of reaching the seventh rank would be too small.But now, was someone willing to attack Li Hao in order to help them obtain the stars of the great path?It was highly unlikely!Red Moon master's eyes were cold. Supreme Emperor Yunxiao was silent for a while and suddenly said,""I don't want to have too much conflict with you! "I don't have ten billion great Dao crystals either. It's one billion great Dao crystals in exchange for a great Dao star ... But you need to suppress Daoist Coiling Dragon, seal him in the star, and send him out ... In this way, we won't enter or disturb you. We'll live in peace. Otherwise ... Li Hao, Hongyue and I can't get the right to enter and leave. You're the one who forced us to attack!"He didn't go in.At this moment, he was afraid that if he went in, he would really be surrounded and killed.There were four rank seven venerable sovereigns!As for the red moon ... It was useless. The light Thearch was still here.It was too dangerous!Spending money?One billion great Dao crystals wasn't a lot for a level eight master like him, and he didn't want a conflict to break out. In that case, it would be best if he could spend some money and get Li Hao and the others to give him a great Dao star.Of course, he would check them carefully in case they left any traps."Is that possible?" Li Hao sneered.However, sovereign Yunxiao laughed and said,""Of course! At this moment, if Hongyue and I attack ... Yes, you may not be in danger, but the sacred central crypt's method of destruction will be completely broken, and the source of the world will still devour you! You've paid a huge price, but you didn't get any benefits! You've already given it to someone else, so do you really care about giving us an extra star?"He chuckled again,'if mingtang dies, will brother Guangming sit by and do nothing? Will we continue to work with you? "Now, part of your confidence comes from the light, but what if ... The sacred central crypt is killed by the backlash? Brother Guang Ming, am I right?"

He looked at the light Thearch. The light Thearch frowned slightly and said coldly,""You can try!"Yun Xiao chuckled."It's not that I want to try, and I don't want to offend brother Guangming. But ... Everyone can get it, but I, Yun Xiao, and Hong Yue can't get it. So, we might as well not play!"He was also determined and looked at the light!I don't care if your son wants to destroy the world, but if I don't have the opportunity that everyone has, then don't blame me for being impolite!I'm really afraid of you?The Qi movement between the two sides instantly stagnated. In fact, there were still venerable sovereigns observing in the dark. At this moment, they were secretly praying that they would fight!It would be best if both sides suffered!There were four level eight venerable sovereigns in the four-direction region, and there were three here. There were many Level Seven neo martial artists, and there were two here ... Kill them all. One death meant one less. Everyone would have a chance if they died.Two rank eights against one rank eight and five rank Sevens, it wasn't easy to determine the winner.Of course, although level eight was strong, if he really faced the siege of five Level Seven experts ... Red Moon master did not have the support of the great Dao universe, and there was a high chance that he would be the first to be killed ... Actually, it was not bad. Everyone was quite afraid of the Rogue cultivator Red Moon.All the experts were watching the show in the dark, and no one stood out to say a few words.At this moment, Li Hao's expression changed. After a moment of silence, he slowly said,""I don't want great Dao crystals, I want Dao accumulation crystals!"Yun Xiao frowned."Where did this come from? only high-level venerable sovereigns can condense this."Li Hao's group had obtained a lot of loot from killing Xing Shen.Li Hao had also obtained some in the dark Demon Ridge.The Dao accumulation crystal contained the Enlightenment of the great Dao of a high-level venerable sovereign. It was much more precious than the great Dao crystal.Li Hao looked at them for a while and slowly said,""I think it's normal that others don't have it, but the two rank 8 Masters don't have it? You didn't exterminate a Type 7 world? Even if you don't have it, you have cultivated it yourself, and there are still Dao accumulation crystals ... This is my last concession. Otherwise, it'll be a lose-lose situation for both sides!"The cloud Master was silent for a moment before he said,""It's not a lot, just half of the great Dao crystals. Li Hao, this is my final compromise!"Li Hao thought for a while and nodded.""Alright!"After saying that, he turned to look at the light Thearch."Elder Light, come and check for us. I'll suppress the Dao apparition of Coiling Dragon ... Oh, these Dao crystals, I'll give them to brother kongji later ..."The light Thearch was speechless!This guy was really interesting.Are you afraid that I'll scheme against you?For my son to use ... Fine, he didn't say much. He was even a little embarrassed that he didn't pay for it ... Cough, cough, since Li Hao didn't mention it, then ... He would save some money.Since it was for his son, of course he had to check it strictly.Otherwise, it wouldn't be good if his son was tricked.Supreme Emperor Yunxiao, on the other hand, raised his eyebrows slightly and said nothing. He had wanted to leave some traps. The other party might not be able to see anything since they did not have a level eight Supreme Emperor. However, Li Hao was quite cunning.The old man of light was not a good person either. If it were any other time, he might turn a blind eye to it, but ... If it was for his son, the old man would probably do his best.Of course, it was just a side plan. If there was really no other way, it didn't matter. To two level eight venerable sovereigns, one billion or so great Dao crystals was really not a lot. Even if Hong Yue had left the great Dao universe, it did not mean that she did not have any savings. It was impossible for level eight venerable sovereigns to leave all their assets at home when they went out.The body was the big head.Red Moon would definitely have to pay for a part of this since it wasn't much money anyway.……The Coiling Dragon Well.The world origin was still throbbing, but at this moment, the world origin had no other means.Summoning a Phantom was the most powerful means of defense for the origin of the world.If it was in the past, he would be successful in every endeavor.But this time ... The shadow was suppressed by powerful venerable sovereigns. Even if they erupted at the same time, it was useless. They were still suppressed. At this moment, the origin of the world only had one last resort. Summoning the tianfang world's first and strongest person since ancient times, the tianfang master!Once the opponent's shadow appeared, a level nine venerable sovereign, even if it was a projection, could exert the power of a level eight venerable sovereign.But ... At this moment, the world origin could not be summoned.The master of tianfang, who had the deepest imprint, seemed to have disappeared. He could not be summoned, or perhaps he was unwilling to appear.Without the master of tianfang, the origin of the world was just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.At that moment, the only thing that could protect the source of the world was the projection of the seventh stage venerable sovereign, Daoist Coiling Dragon.Li Hao quickly teleported over.There were also two venerable sovereigns here. One was Nanquan and the other was director Zhou. Nanquan was extremely happy at this moment. He felt very happy. This was a good place. The place he had chosen was really good.He no longer had any regrets.I'm already at Tier 3, and I'm still moving towards the peak of Tier 3.Reaching the heavens in a single step! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 This was the true way of ascending to the heavens with a single step. In just a short while, he had gone from level one to level three. It was too cool.At this moment, he was not afraid of bursting.As long as the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor's apparition was suppressed, he could leave and stay as he wished. What was there to be afraid of?But ... Li Hao was the only one who came.Could Li Hao suppress a level Seven venerable sovereign?Even if it wasn't his main body, he was still very powerful.While he was thinking, Li Hao teleported over and took a look at the projection of the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor. He had seen the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor before, and the latter was actually the first Imperial Emperor Tian Fang that he had ever come into contact with.

Chapter 3107 The World's Recovery (3)
The other party had once guided him on the cultivation method of the physical body Dao.At this moment, although it was only a projection, it was also a projection of the other party's body. It was formed by some of the marks left in tianfang in the past. Its eyes were a little empty, as if it had no consciousness.After watching for a while, Li Hao said, senior, you taught me physical mantras in the past, but I was unwilling to fight you! Return to the physical body Dao star and go to the cloud cosmos!"The shadow was unmoved.Li Hao waited in silence for a while. Without saying anything, he appeared in the myriad world domain and suppressed the shadow with his great Dao. The shadow did not seem to resist. The shadow of a level Seven venerable Emperor was easily suppressed by Li Hao!In the blink of an eye, a Golden dragon-like power of the Taoist connotation swam in Li Hao's River.Li Hao glanced at it and went straight to the Dao universe.A moment later, he locked onto the position of a star.Soon, he arrived near the larger star and injected all the Taoist connotation of the Golden Dragon into it. The star flickered, and at this moment, the image of the Daoist Coiling Dragon that Li Hao had met that day seemed to appear.His opponent's shadow loomed among the stars. Li Hao glanced at it and made a grabbing motion. The stars quickly condensed and were compressed by him. Without saying anything, Li Hao soared into the sky! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 ……Outside the realm gate.Holding the star in his hand, Li Hao looked at the two level eight venerable sovereigns and then at the light venerable sovereign.""Elder Light, did they give you Dao crystals and Taoist connotation crystals?""I've given it to him,"The radiance Thearch waved his hand, and a small compressed space containing countless great Dao crystals flew toward Li Hao. Before Li Hao could catch it, a sword radiance appeared and picked up the small space.Venerable the sword chuckled and grabbed the small space,""Thank you for your trouble!"The light Thearch raised his eyebrows slightly but didn't say anything.This group of people is really vigilant. My son is among them."Give it to me!" Cloud Master said in a low voice."Give me the great Dao star!"Li Hao glanced at him and smiled.""For you or for Red Moon?"Cloudsky laughed in disdain!It was a low-end scheme to sow discord."Give it to me!"Hong Yue is a guy without a Dao universe. It's not easy to put it away. Besides, she still has to rely on me at this moment. Why would she fight with me?Li Hao, you're too naive.Red Moon master did not say anything and just stood beside him indifferently.Li Hao didn't say much. He threw the star and chuckled."How can a master of desire like the Crimson Moon resist the control of tianfang universe? That's a waste of the path of desire!" "Silver Moon King, you don't have to worry about that," Red Moon master said indifferently.Then, he looked at tianfang world and smiled,""In addition, as for you ... You're only at the fifth step, but you're pretty good at using horizontal means! However, one side was light, and the other side was neo martial. Without his own strength, Silver Moon would only be a vassal for the rest of his life! From what I see, you're quite ambitious, your methods aren't weak, and your talent isn't bad ... What a pity!""If Ming Hall can really take the opportunity to enter Level Seven ... It's not like you, Li Hao, have entered Level Seven. Guangming will have another level Seven venerable sovereign, and it won't cost any resources. Brother Guangming, you'll be very happy!"At this moment, the few of them could tell.Before this, they had always thought that Li Hao was just a vassal of neo martial, but now it seemed ... That was not necessarily the case.Because he had previously seized a large number of resources, this person had actually used them to train the Silvermoon people, giving birth to many venerable sovereigns. It should be known that with so many resources to train dozens of venerable sovereigns, it might be enough for a level six neo martial artist to advance to Level Seven.Neo martial artists were so poor that it was useless to train a group of first level venerable sovereigns. At the current stage, what he needed was a top venerable sovereign!Obviously, this was the Silver Moon King's Own idea. His own calculations, including the void, seemed to be only related to this person. At this point, everyone could see one thing. Light and neo martial might not have any connection.More importantly, the Silver Moon King seemed to have a good relationship with Kong Ji.This was the foundation for the connection between the two powerful worlds.Li Hao chuckled."Then I can't wait for you to reach Level Seven. That way, the next time I meet senior Red Moon ... Perhaps your Dao of Nirvana and the Dao of duality will be able to suppress this wandering cultivator!"A rogue cultivator!Red Moon master's eyes turned cold again, and she laughed."Your eloquence isn't weak, but unfortunately ... A Tier 5 is a Tier 5. No matter how strong a Tier 5 is, it's still only a Tier 5!"Then, he ignored Li Hao.As for the cloud Master, he kept the stars of the great path and investigated. He didn't find any problems, so he didn't stay. He laughed and said,""Then I'll wish you, nephew mingtang, to step into Level Seven in advance, and the power of the world of light will increase greatly! Brother Guangming, you've made a good plan, I'm impressed!"No matter what the radiance Supreme Emperor thought, he tore the great path universe apart, presented the entrance, and left with the red moon Supreme Emperor.If he didn't go back now, he was really worried that someone would attack the cloud world.At this moment, there were only two rank 7s in charge.Seeing that they had left, some people secretly felt a little regretful. Damn it, they actually didn't fight. It was such a pity.The Lord of the clouds, this coward!He had actually spent money to buy a star of the great path and thought that the other party would attack.Since the two rank eights had run away, and they knew that Tian Fang would not recover, and they needed time to comprehend the star path, the venerable sovereigns quickly retreated from the dark.As for the world of nihilation...Let it be destroyed!At this moment, at most, there would be another level Seven venerable sovereign.However, once they interfered, there might not be just one tier 7 who would die. If Tian Fang did not recover, one more tier 7 would not matter. Once he recovered, there might be a tier 9. This was what everyone was concerned about.

Chapter 3108 The World's Recovery_ 4
However, the light Thearch didn't want to leave.He still wanted to see if his son would be able to step into Level Seven after destroying and reviving the world.Li Hao didn't say anything. He just glanced at venerable the sword. Venerable the sword nodded slightly. He would keep an eye on them.Not allowing the other party to enter!Even if the other party was Kong Ji's father, it would not do. In the primal Chaos, one could not hope for the other party to be kind. If he saw an opportunity, perhaps this light Emperor would do something.Li Hao had never considered them as one.……Tianfang world.Li Hao's voice resounded,'the high-level venerable Emperor's Taoist connotation has been suppressed, and now is a good time for everyone to comprehend the low-level venerable Emperor's Taoist connotation! The origin of the world has given the Taoist connotation enough life force ... This is a rare opportunity, and this is a heaven-sent opportunity for me, Silver Moon! Everyone, you must seize the opportunity and treasure everything!"After saying that, Li Hao continued, chaos is just that dangerous! It was so ... Realistic! If it weren't for the four level Seven venerable sovereigns and Dao friend Kong Ji's father, Senior Light, who is a level eight venerable sovereign, I wouldn't have been able to defend Tian Fang. Even so ... In order to ensure everyone's safety, I could only give up the Dao accumulations of those high level venerable sovereigns and even give up the level nine great Dao universe!"Although Li Hao's voice was calm, the venerable sovereigns and Dao integration cultivators outside were all in low spirits.Some people clenched their fists!Yes, they saw it.Seeing those experts take away powerful bodies with Dao accumulations and great Dao stars, seeing Marchioness Silvermoon, he had no choice but to compromise and give up the greatest benefits of tianfang world!That was because ... Silver Moon was too weak.They did not know Li Hao's exact plan. Even the four level Seven venerable sovereigns felt that it was a pity. If no one had caused trouble and they had suppressed them, the Taoist connotation of the advanced venerable sovereigns would have been of great benefit!Even if he could not become a high-level venerable sovereign, it would be of great help to his enlightenment of the great Dao.What a pity!So many high-level venerable sovereigns 'Dao accumulations were gone just like that. They were taken away by one expert after another. At the same time, they also took away the control of tianfang universe.Southern Fist, who had been smiling happily a moment ago, also fell silent at this moment.He sighed softly!Silver Moon was a burden to Li Hao.He had been a burden!From the moment they had left the Silver Moon, they had pursued him with all their might, but ... They were too slow and too late. They had to rely on Li Hao to reach the Dao integration stage. They had to rely on Li Hao to become venerable sovereigns.Li Hao had spent too many resources on them.Dozens of worlds and billions of great Dao crystals!Now, he had even given up a tier 9 world for them.He suddenly felt that they were too useless.He only knew how to spend money, but he couldn't bring Li Hao any help or benefit!He was only a first level venerable sovereign. Even if he was a third level venerable sovereign ... It seemed to be of no use in that situation just now. So what if there were many people? Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Even if more than 30 venerable sovereigns joined forces, they would probably be killed by a seventh-rank monster!This was the power of an advanced venerable sovereign! There was not a single advanced venerable sovereign in the entire Silver Moon. Li Hao was the only one who was walking on a tightrope again and again, fighting for opportunities for everyone.……All the Silvermoon cultivators in tianfang world were silent.Someone was observing the Taoist connotation.Someone was absorbing energy.Some were comprehending their Grand DAOs, while others were bitterly cultivating with their eyes closed. No one said a word, and there was nothing they could say. Those who fell behind would be beaten. Silver moon's improvement was actually extremely fast, so fast that it was inconceivable. It had only been a few years since he left the Stargate, but Silver Moon had already become a Tier 4 world!At this moment, it was rapidly climbing to the fifth step.But ... It was too slow!Right now, it was the world of the seventh rank venerable sovereigns and the eighth rank venerable sovereigns. Even if there were more than 30 silver Moon venerable sovereigns, so what?How many people are there in the intermediate level?The opportunities that Li Hao had fought for them far exceeded those in Tier 6 worlds, but ...The Silver Moon martial masters weren't willing to accept this, but they were also in despair.Helpless despair!We're actually very fast ... But we're still so slow.Entering the venerable sovereign level was something that everyone had found unbelievable in the past. They had been very excited before, but today, they could only watch as the powerful existences took away the powerful Dao accumulation phantoms in front of them as if they had entered a deserted land.They had not felt this sense of despair and powerlessness for a long time.……In the sky.Venerable the sword looked on in silence.The old neo martial was actually the same, and it was even more difficult than this.The Silvermoon people seemed to be more arrogant than the neo martial artists.Perhaps ... It was because they had never lost before. Under the silver moon King's leadership, everything seemed to be going smoothly. Even if the Silver Moon King was not the strongest existence, every choice and every plan he made was successful.That was why the Silvermoon people were all very proud.However ... Being proud was useless. Neo martial was also very proud, but after stepping into chaos, neo martial had actually been wandering around, even losing Silver Moon back then.Venerable the sword glanced at Li Hao.He didn't know if it was Li Hao's plan to give up the stars of the great path, or if ... He really had no choice. In fact, if he had retaliated just now, he might have had a chance, although it would have been troublesome.At the very least, he could escape and retain control of the tianfang great Dao universe.However, Li Hao gave up.It was not until this moment that venerable the sword felt that he could not see through this young man. He was very young among the venerable sovereigns, and even among the seventh level venerable sovereigns, he was like a phoenix Feather or a Qilin horn. He was so young that it was unbelievable.

Chapter 3109 The World's Recovery_ 5
However, Li Hao was only in his 20s.He was as young as the human King back then.At that time, the human King would at least have old Zhang and people like him to follow him. Even at the final moment, when the battle against the celestial Thearch began, old Zhang, the young king, the king of earth and the others would all be present. They would all be able to participate in the battle and help the human King fight against the enemy together.Neo martial was not the neo martial of the human King alone.As for Silvermoon ... It seemed that he was the only one who had held up the cauldron, the one who had shouldered the rise of the entire Silvermoon clan. How difficult had that been?!Silver moon's Foundation was simply too weak. He was only in an unranked world.Even though the Dao of time existed, it was only in its embryonic form.It was already incredible that he could reach level five and dozens of venerable sovereigns in such a short time.……He was still thinking.At this moment, Li Hao's encouragement did not seem to be a bad thing for the Silver Moon soldiers. Instead, he smiled.It instantly arrived near the source of the world.Bang Bang Bang!The heart-like origin of the world was still beating, but ... It seemed to be at its wit's end. It was helpless and unable to resist.Li Hao suddenly said,"you're the origin of life and the existence that gave birth to life. You should be able to sense it. It's just that the world will be destroyed, not destroyed. I have a friend who wants to cultivate the Dao of destruction and revival, not the Dao of creation and destruction. Revival is still possible!""The more you resist now, the more energy you'll be consumed. When we return, we might not be able to resurrect you. It's better to preserve your life force and first perish. If my friend fails to resurrect you ... It'll be better for you to resurrect yourself than to struggle now!"Li Hao looked at the Dao crystals around it and said,""In just a short while, you've burned one billion of the eight billion great Dao crystals, which has benefited others ... I'll leave you one billion for your recovery. Leave the remaining six billion to me!"The origin of the world was beating as if it had no consciousness.However, if the source of a world really had no consciousness at all, how could it retaliate?Clearly, there was still some consciousness left."Unwilling? Or was he reluctant? I don't want much, and most of it has been given to senior Dao Qi. Dao chess is also your tianfang world's sovereign weapon ... I won't leave much behind ... Perhaps, you won't lose anything if you take a few billion or a few billion to satisfy our cultivation! You'll soon be able to absorb a large amount of great Dao crystals again, but if you persist ... I might destroy you!"Li Hao revealed a faint killing intent.A moment later, his beating heart slowly stopped beating, and the Dao crystals around him stopped burning. In the distance, some Taoist connotation phantoms also started to dim gradually. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃  Obviously, the origin of the world chose to stop resisting in the end ... Not because of Li Hao's threat. In fact, the origin of the world did not seem to be too afraid of Li Hao's threat, but at this moment, a long river appeared, and a cat floated above the river, looking at the origin of the world with some curiosity.The origin of the world had compromised!Second cat!This cat, which ate the world's origin, was different from Emperor Cang. Emperor Cang ate everything, but er Mao was a picky eater. He ate the world's origin and ate a lot of it. That feeling was too much of a threat to the world's origin!Second cat licked its lips and said,""What a big fish!"This was a super big fish!Second cat felt that if it ate it, it could instantly appear in the world. Not only that, it could even become a top-tier master. At the very least, it would not be weaker than big cat.I really want to eat it!He looked at Li Hao with some reluctance ... Should he eat this big fish?They didn't have much power to resist anyway!Li Hao shook his head slightly and said telepathically,""Tian Fang's master is the master of space, but until now, I haven't felt any secondary space in Tian Fang. Therefore ... Tian Fang might be the real virtual world, two layers of space, and today, it's only the surface world! Be careful that you don't eat this guy and cause big trouble. You might even ... Attract the master of Tian Fang. He doesn't care if we cause trouble on the surface, but once it involves the deeper levels, be careful that you don't get beaten to death!"Second cat nodded and didn't say anything.As for Li Hao, he reached out and countless great Dao crystals fell into his hands again. "Aren't you going to stay? If you hadn't used all of them before, you might have been able to step into the sixth step!"He had already spent ten billion crystals before, and now he had obtained another seven billion. In addition to the one billion that Supreme Emperor cloud heaven gave him, he had spent twenty billion crystals ... An Ordinary Level Seven would only spend ten billion.It was not hard to imagine how much Li Hao had consumed.If they had all stayed, they might have been able to reach level six by now. For a freak like Li Hao in the myriad cultivation world, reaching level six was even more difficult than reaching Level Seven."No hurry! To me, there is no qualitative change between the fifth and sixth step! Let's first upgrade the others, push the entire Silver Moon to the fifth rank, restore the Dao chess, and let the void advance to the seventh rank ..."He would push these people to their limits first, then all the resources would naturally belong to him.Second cat didn't say anything.She just felt that ... Sometimes, Li Hao was too much like a battle.Sometimes, it was not like that, but for example, at this moment ... The good things were given to others first. In fact, the battle back then was also like this. It was as if he never cared about these things.
