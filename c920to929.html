        my base.
         There used to be martial masters Training in the square every day, but now it was very quiet.
         The demon hunt squad members were also training.
         Ten people in a group, all familiarizing themselves with the ten ring Mountain sealing formation. Dozens of people were scattered in this huge square, and their voices were extremely low.
         Liu Long had returned early, right after hou Xiaochen had left.
         He didn't mind not being able to talk to hou Xiaochen.
         When hou Xiaochen left, he didn't say anything to anyone.
         In addition to them, there were also some ordinary people in the base who were responsible for cleaning and cooking. However, in this huge base, these people were all in the living area, and no one could be seen.
         ……
         When Li Hao returned, he saw this desolate scene.
          Li Hao only watched them train for a while before he left.
         He had to go to the warehouse first.
         He wasn't familiar with the Wei Wu army base, but he still knew where the warehouse was.
         After walking for a while, a single-story house appeared.
         There were people on duty in front of the bungalow.
         The martial masters of the Wei Wu Army ran away, but there were still a few support-type superpowers left behind. When they saw Li Hao, the Yue Ming superpowers who were left behind at the entrance hurriedly called out,""We pay our respects to the centurion!"
         Li Hao glanced at him and felt that he wasn't young anymore.
         He probably didn't want to follow the Wei Wu Army anymore, so this man who looked almost 50 chose to stay.
         "How many supers are left in the base?" Li Hao nodded.
         "Including this subordinate, there are 9 people!"
         "There are eight moon nethers and one sun god," the man replied."We're mainly in charge of monitoring the perimeter and repairing the base. If there's a mission, we'll be with you!"
         There was a surveillance area here, and the entire artificial forest was under surveillance.
         Li Hao nodded slightly."I'll meet you later. Now that the others have left, I'll temporarily be the chiliarch. I'm not too familiar with you, so I'll just meet you."
         "Congratulations, Captain!" The man immediately said.
         “……”
         Li Hao laughed and glanced at him. Sure enough, old people have good eyes. I was just saying this, but you changed your mind so quickly.
         "Open the warehouse."
         "The key should be with the captain ..."
         Was it?
         Li Hao took out the storage ring given to him by golden spear and opened it. Golden spear seemed to have some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The items in the storage ring were all arranged neatly.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had obtained too many things and stuffed his storage rings into a mess.  It was mainly because he had gained too much and had no time to organize it.
         He scanned through the storage rings and indeed found the key to the storage room. That was because they had already marked it for him and even gave him an introduction. How could he not find it?
         Li Hao couldn't help but laugh. He didn't know if the Golden spear had tidied it up or if it had been his disciple.
         He didn't think too much about it and took out the key to open the heavy door of the warehouse.
         ……
         He pushed the door open and entered.
         The warehouse was also tidied up neatly.
         It was an Armory outside. There were all kinds of weapons, and they didn't look too bad. Other than these weapons, the most eye-catching ones were 50 sets of black armor. Li Hao was stunned.
         He had borrowed 30 divine power stones and pawned 50 sets of armor.
         However, after he returned, he was busy with his seclusion, and then he sent his people away today ... In fact, Li Hao didn't even remember this. Besides, he knew that golden spear and the others didn't have enough armors, only about 500 sets. He had long assumed that he had swallowed those 50 sets.
         But at this moment, Li Hao felt a little emotional when he saw the 50 sets of armor placed here neatly.
         Jin gun was a good person. He had forgotten to return the 30 divine power stones he owed him.
         Although he couldn't use the 50 sets of armor now, Li Hao had the authority to activate Black Phoenix. Perhaps he could use them when he recruited people in the future.
         He did not activate the armor of the Wei Wu Army. After all, they were separated by a layer, and there was not enough time, so he did not think about it. Now that he thought about it, back then, he had destroyed a heaven battling Army and all ten regiments.
         They had obtained about 900 sets of armor, some of which were destroyed along with the ten regimental commanders.
         Li Hao had 100, while the Wei Wu Army had around 500.
         The three great organizations had 100 each.
         However, he had not seen any of the three great organizations in black armor in Silver Moon ... So it was very likely that the black armor had been transported to the central continent.
         "The heaven-battling Army's armor ... Will have to be taken back sooner or later!"
         Li Hao mumbled. He was a Regiment commander, after all. For dark energy organizations like the three major organizations, wearing the armor of the heaven battling Army was a disgrace to the heaven battling Army. The Wei Wu Army was on the side of justice, after all.
          Armors, weapons, and even some ordinary armors were all in the warehouse.
         Li Hao continued forward to check the treasures left behind.
         The Wei Wu Army had taken away most of the items, so the warehouse was a little empty.
         However, after walking for a while, Li Hao saw a small secret room. He pushed the door open and his eyes flickered. This was the ancient books room. The Wei Wu Army had obtained some ancient books while exploring the ruins, but most of them were placed here.
         Some of them were just ordinary ancient books, but to Li Hao, they were quite a good harvest.
         He randomly flipped open one of the books. The quality of the ancient books was not bad, and they were well maintained. When he opened it, there were a few large words written on it: "battle of Nanjiang."
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. Battle records?
         This was rare. The ancient books he had in his possession rarely had such records.
         When he opened the book, the opening chapter was Xuanji's first year of neo martial arts.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Neo martial seemed to be an era or a year. Li Hao had read about this in many ancient books. It was said that the ancient civilization was above the early stage of the ancient civilization, and the ancient civilization used neo martial as a year.
        
         He continued to read, and soon, his eyes moved slightly.
         This was an ancient book that not many people would care about. He didn't know if other people had read it or if they could understand it, but they should be able to, right?
         This was the first time that Li Hao had seen a brief introduction of experts from the ancient civilization in a book.
         The human King, the martial King, the nether King ...
         One by one, names replaced their names as they appeared in the book.
         According to the book, Nanjiang seemed to be the old home of the human King during the ancient civilization period. Back then, the human King was studying outside and was still very weak. Later, Nanjiang was invaded by foreign enemies. The book named it the alien race in the catacombs, and a war broke out between the two sides in Nanjiang.
         On the other hand, the weak human rulers followed a large number of human powerhouses and charged into the catacombs. In order to prevent the human territory in Nanjiang from suffering any losses and to protect the people of Nanjiang, even though it was extremely dangerous to go deep into the enemy's hinterlands, these people still charged in without hesitation in the end.
         Annihilate the enemy!
         They wouldn't let the enemy take half a step into the territory of the human race, even if they died in battle outside and couldn't return to their homeland ...
         Li Hao had only wanted to flip through the book, but after a moment of silence, he continued to read. According to the book, that battle was very brutal. Soon, he saw a familiar name.
          "In the battle of the Nanjiang catacombs, the longevity Swordmaster fought a bloody battle and killed a rank-8 with his sword. With a rank-6 body, he cut off longevity with one sword and killed a rank-8 golden body, shocking the world! "The human King wailed and carried the dying longevity Swordmaster around the catacombs, fighting and killing in all directions. The battle of Nanjiang revealed the might of the human King and the name of the longevity Swordmaster resounded throughout the two worlds ..."
         The longevity Swordmaster!
         This was a name that Li Hao was familiar with. It seemed that ... Some people called their ancestors in this way.
         According to the book, his ancestor seemed to be very weak at that time. As for the so-called rank-6 ... Li Hao had actually read some ancient books and found that he was very weak. Even he could make some deductions now. It was said that the Divine Will had not even been revealed.
         It was just that his physical body was slightly stronger. Rank-8 was known as the Grandmaster realm. This was somewhat similar to the [hundred slash and thousand slash], or perhaps ... Even more powerful.
         Cultivating a sword in ten years, from a useless person in everyone's eyes to a brilliant feat. However, this was not the most eye-catching achievement in this battle.
         The ancient civilization's human King, the extremely weak human King, had completely risen in this battle.
         "As a rank-4, he moved around the catacombs. And in the introduction of the catacombs, there are countless rank-9 powerhouses ... Perhaps, it's the same concept as today's countless sunguang. And the other party is a rank-4, maybe only the kind that has broken through the early 100 ...
         In the end, in this battle, not only did the human ruler kill countless people, he destroyed a large city and even saved the longevity Swordmaster. In this battle, the human race completely defeated the foreign invasion of the Nanjiang catacombs ...
         This was known as the most important battle for the first rise of the human King, so the book had made a detailed introduction, revealing the madness, despair, tenacity, and wisdom of the human King of that era.
         The difference in strength was huge, but everyone was willing to die. Many human powerhouses died in this battle. Li Hao still remembered a sentence in the book.
         At the critical moment of the battle, the older grandmasters all used the blood Blade technique to self-destruct.
         In the new martial era, there were no grandmasters who died of old age. There were only grandmasters who died in battle. When they reached the age of old age, they would be exhausted and rush to the depths of the catacombs to fight against strong enemies. They would fight to the death and never look back!
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was just a few written records, but Li Hao was a little agitated.  He thought of the heaven battling Army!
         He had thought that the heaven-battling Army was already extremely elite, but now ... The martial masters of that era were simply incredible.
         In order to defend against a strong enemy, even though they knew they were no match, they still went to their deaths.
         There were no martial masters who died of old age, only martial masters who died in battle!
         As he grew older, he went deep into the enemy's camp and fought alone, not stopping until he died ...
         He flipped through the pages, feeling and recalling ...
         He even substituted his body into it.
         Was that era ... Like this?
         What about the star origin era I belong to?
         Li Hao wondered if there were still people with such spirit in this era.
         "However ... We don't have any external enemies. We only have internal conflicts. After a long time, I sighed and shook my head. In this era ... It's very difficult for people like the ones in the book to appear.
         Some of the words were unforgettable to Li Hao.
          In order to exterminate the enemy outside, the powerful martial masters rushed to the front line to protect the ordinary people, even though it was more dangerous and more serious to go deep into the enemy camp. In the end, they won at a higher price.
         If they allowed the enemy to enter Nanjiang territory, they might be able to defeat the enemy at a smaller price, provided that ... A large number of civilians would die.
         But ...
         Li Hao wondered what the people in power would do if they could annihilate dozens of rising lights with the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.
         In the book, the martial king only had a brief glimpse and a few words.
         However, the martial King was the leader of the human race at that time. In order to prevent the enemy from entering the human race's territory, that person still gave the order to fight in the catacombs, even if it meant death.
         "The era ... Is different ..."
         Li Hao mumbled. It was no longer that era.
         However, the book also said that the new martial era began with them. They created the new era, not because the era was born from them. It was them who created this crazy and hot-blooded era.
         This book also mentioned one last line. This kind of battle was only one out of thousands of battles. In the new martial era, the catacombs had invaded many times, but ... They had never crossed the human territory!
        
         No matter how strong he was, he had never been.
         In the new martial era, the enemies were unimaginably powerful. However, in the end, they were all destroyed outside the human territory. Tens of thousands of homes were lit up and they were prosperous. The faith of the human race and hundreds of millions of common people, everyone trusted those powerhouses. Countless young people rushed to the battlefield and died in foreign lands, but they had no regrets.
         "Exaggerated ..."
         Li Hao mumbled. It was just a record similar to a novel. It was certainly exaggerated, but he did not believe that such a thing could have happened in the ancient civilization.
         But ... What about the heaven battling Army?
         In his heart, he was still somewhat shocked.
         Li Hao smiled bitterly and shook his head. In the past few days, what he had seen and heard the most was annihilating enemies ... He didn't know if he was being too sensitive or if he was really overthinking.
         Every time he saw this, he felt as if it was a reminder to him not to use the Silver Moon as a battlefield. Be it Pirates or powerhouses, it was best to wipe them out outside of the Silver Moon.
         Don't interfere with the lives of ordinary people, and don't involve them.
         Hao lianchuan was also reminding himself not to wait for the Pirates to invade before he retaliated. He had to get rid of them before they did.
          "Human King ..."
         "The longevity Swordmaster ..."
         Li Hao mumbled again, somewhat absent-minded. Was it really that strong?
         No, not strong.
         Instead, it was a kind of extreme madness and hot-bloodedness, fighting the strong with the weak, not stopping until one of them was dead, incomparably crazy. Human King ... Was he that crazy murderer he had seen?
         What did rank-4 mean?
         In the catacombs where rank-9s dominated, he killed in all directions and brought along the dying longevity Swordmaster. In the end, he obtained an astonishing battle record and harvest. From there, he officially rose to power in the human race.
         These thoughts reverberated in Li Hao's mind.
         He quickly put down the book and walked to the next place. He had only come here to check out the stock. As for the rest, he would Read less of these books in the future. Every time he read them, he would have the urge to ... Take a gamble!
         Don't hold back!
         Being weak wasn't scary. What was scary was not daring to go crazy, but ... If one was not careful, they would die.
         At this moment, Li Hao didn't want to die that badly.
         They continued forward. After a while, they entered a secret room. A ship, shining with light, was placed in the secret room. It was very small, only about a meter in length, but Li Hao knew that it was an origin god weapon.
         It should be able to be enlarged.
         He didn't know if the soldier soul had recovered.
         At this thought, Li Hao tapped the ship's hull with the starry sky sword in his hand."If you've recovered, come out and meet me. Otherwise ... I'll cut you in half!"
         The ship was silent.
         Li Hao knew that these guys were not afraid. The simple starry sky sword was not the key to the fear of weapon souls. The next moment, a sword intent appeared in his mind ...
         In an instant, a soldier soul appeared.
         It was something that looked like a big fish, but also like a bird.  Li Hao took a closer look and frowned ... What kind of demon was this?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A fish that can fly?
         At this moment, the soldier soul seemed to be trembling.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He just said,""I can recognize you as my master, right? The kind that recognizes its master by blood?"
         The big fish didn't say anything, but the ship trembled.
         With the experience of communicating with the Phoenix spear last time, Li Hao took it as a silent agreement. He forced out a drop of blood from his finger. The next moment, the blood dripped and entered the ship.
         The ship trembled slightly.
         At this moment, Li Hao's mind was filled with a few more things. This was actually his first time trying to make an origin divine weapon recognize him as its master. Although he had many origin divine weapons, Li Hao had never thought of doing so.
         Actually, it wasn't that simple to recognize a master.
         However, when Li Hao wielded the starry sky sword and unleashed the longevity sword intent ... The origin god weapon chose to make the process easier. The big fish was afraid that the process would be complicated and that it would be cut into pieces.
         "Giant chariot divine boat ..."
         Li Hao murmured, and his eyes flickered. There was some simple information in his mind. This was a very powerful ship, and there seemed to be some information about the forbidden Sea. This was a ship that could travel on the forbidden Sea.
         It was extremely rare!
         Therefore, the North Sea was no different from a small river to this ship.
         If the ship was enlarged, it could carry 1000 people, just enough for the Wei Wu Army. They had used the Golden spear a few times before, but it had recognized an owner, so the effect was not very good. Many functions were not activated, and they could not be activated.
         Li Hao digested the information.
         After thinking for a while, a silver armor suddenly appeared on his body. The next moment, his divine will fluctuated."Can I look up some information about the armor?"
         The armor system of the ancient civilization was very impressive. Could he find out something about it?
         A moment later, a line of numbers appeared in front of Li Hao."The database has not been activated. Data is missing. Insufficient authority. Only some basic services can be provided ..."
          Li Hao now understood that the database system of this armor in heaven battling city might not have been repaired yet.
         It was a pity!
         Otherwise, he might have been able to search for many things. He would not have to guess how to use an origin god weapon like he did now.
         After keeping the giant venomous ship and acknowledging its master, this thing could be kept. It was quite convenient.
         Li Hao continued to wander around the warehouse. A moment later, he arrived at a small secret room. This was the Wei Wu Army's information storage room. Li Hao sat down and began to read some information.
         This included some information on the ruins, as well as the ruins that the Golden spear had not explored before, as well as some information on the Pirates.
         ……
         At the same time.
         At the administration Bureau.
         Director Zhao was in his office. After he finished his work, he looked at director Zhou,"that little guy, he's gone back?"
        
         "Yes, he went to the base."
         Director Zhao smiled,"do you think he's hiding, or do you have other thoughts?."
         "It's hard to say,"
         Deputy Director Zhou shook his head,"we don't know much about Li Hao." Whether it's hou Xiaochen or you, director, it seems like you all want him to take some responsibility, but I don't think ... There's a need to do so. The eight great families were indeed families that protected the common people during the ancient civilization, but director, don't forget that countless years later, the glory and responsibility of our ancestors don't apply to him now. "
         Hou Xiaochen, director Zhao, and the other Silver Moon experts all seemed to hope that Li Hao could take on some of the responsibility.
         However, Deputy Director Zhou didn't agree.
         "The eight great protector clans only protect the humans of the past, not the Silver Moon of today. Besides, Li Hao is too young. His parents and friends have both died. I think the director is too optimistic."
         Director Zhao sighed."We don't know either. The eight great families will all be gathered in the Silver City. However ... If the people of the eight great families are good, that's fine. But if they are evil, it will be a huge disaster!"
         "As you can see, Red Moon is one of the eight great families. Once she does evil, people will be plunged into misery and suffering ... Hou Xiaochen and I both hope that Li Hao can always stand on the side of order, not evil ..."
         Deputy Director Zhou thought for a while and said,"it's very difficult to have high expectations of him!" "We can only subtly influence him and lead by example. Director, tell me...If we can't do it ourselves, is it possible to let him do it? He's still young and needs to be taught by words and actions, not orders or coercion. "
          He didn't quite agree with hou Xiaochen and director Zhao's actions, as they weren't ideal.
         When director Zhao heard this, he laughed bitterly and shook his head, sighing,""We want to, too, but unfortunately ... We can't afford to do so now. Forget it, just let him be. Have someone keep an eye on the sea to prevent any accidents. As for Li Hao, just let him be. As long as he doesn't cause trouble in Silver Moon, we don't care what he does."
         Deputy Director Zhou didn't say anything more and continued with his work.
         The two of them had worked together for many years. Now, their offices were connected, making it easy to communicate. This was also very rare.
         ……
         At this moment, everyone's attention was focused on hou Xiaochen's group.
         Someone had been paying attention to their whereabouts.
         He was calculating how long it would take for them to leave the northern province.
         There were also people paying attention to Silver moon's Li Hao, but Li Hao had directly entered the Wei Wu army base, so there was no point in paying attention to him. After hou Xiaochen and the others left, the entire Silver Moon seemed to have fallen into a deathly silence.
         ……
         North Sea.
         The waves roared, and a voice mixed with violence and anger came from a large ship.""Hou Xiaochen's gone, and so are the Wei Wu Army. According to the time, they'll probably reach the North Sea tomorrow or the day after ... Should I take the initiative and ambush them there?"
         "Are you seeking death?"
         Someone's voice was calm and cold."The Wei Wu Army, hou Xiaochen, Jin Jin gun, and Yu Luosha were all there. All of the sunguang experts from the three organizations died at their hands. Is your brain filled with shit?"  The brutal voice rose again,"but I'm not willing to let them go just like that!" That bastard Jin gun has killed many of our brothers in the past few years ..."
         "Then you can lead your men to ambush them. If the brothers are willing, I won't stop you!"
         “……”
         As soon as these words came out, the big ship fell silent.
         "If big brother doesn't go, we won't have the ability to ..." The brutal voice sounded helpless.
         He was a little unwilling.
         But if their boss didn't go, they really didn't have the guts to do so. Hou Xiaochen was too terrifying. If their boss went, they might still have a chance in the sea. After all, those people were all experts on land, and the North Sea was their territory.
         "Then shut up!"
         The cold voice rose again, not too willing to pay attention. All he knew was to come up with bad ideas.
         Ambush hou Xiaochen?
         Even the three major organizations don't dare to do so, and you want me to ambush him?
         Was he going to die?
         It wasn't easy to lay down such a large family business and dominate the sea. Even if he wanted to die, this wasn't the way to do it.
          "Big brother, even if we don't take revenge on Jin gun and the others, we have to take revenge on Silver Moon ... Now that the Wei Wu Army and hou Xiaochen are gone, why don't we just go to Silver Moon and slaughter a few of their cities? we'll make the Wei Wu Army and hou Xiaochen regret this!"
         "Silver Moon is poor. Other than Whitemoon city, where else is there a rich place?"
         "Perhaps hou Xiaochen isn't the only one hiding his strength in Whitemoon city," the cold voice said with some dissatisfaction."Whitemoon city is quite dangerous. It's meaningless to attack it. It might even cause some trouble."
         "Big brother, even if we don't touch Whitemoon city, we still have to kill a few Silvermoon people. Silvermoon still has a few cities adjacent to the moon sea, so we can just slaughter one! Otherwise ... Not only me, but my brothers won't be satisfied either! "Besides, we've been holding it in for quite some time now. Let's go out and relax. The three northern provinces are at war, so it's not good for us to go up now, lest we become a target ... But it's still fine to go to Silver Moon to have a good time. Otherwise, we won't be able to hold it in anymore!"
         At this moment, there was a clamor in the big ship.
         "Yes, boss, third master is right. I'm almost dying of suffocation!"
         "That's right. The Wei Wu Army has killed many of our men before ... Silver Moon and his group of barbarians are really detestable!"
         “……”
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The emotions of the crowd surged.
         At this time, the man in white sitting on the throne frowned slightly. He looked at the bearded man in the crowd. There was a scar on his forehead, left by Jin Jin two years ago.
        
         Obviously, this person couldn't wait to take revenge.
         He furrowed his brows,"hou Xiaochen's a sinister and cunning man. If he dares to leave with the Wei Wu Army, he wouldn't be completely unprepared!" Silver Moon isn't an idiot either. If we go now, it might be a trap ..."
         "Boss, we're Pirates, not politicians!" The bearded man said in a frustrated manner. With our strength, do we still need to worry so much? If silver Moon was that strong, he would've dominated the world long ago. Why would he wait until now?"
         He was a little dissatisfied with his boss's unreasonable and indecisive attitude.
         Of course, it was useless to be dissatisfied. He was not as strong as this person.
         In the sea, strength was King.
         Furthermore, what was Silver Moon to him?
         They had even ransacked some of the cities along the central coastline. They were human beings, and they needed to eat, drink, sh * t, and women to relieve themselves. Because the situation had not been right recently, they had not been out for a long time.
         Silver moon's defenses had clearly fallen into a state of dormancy, so he would be letting down the scar on his forehead that had nearly claimed his life if he did not visit the Guild.
         That old golden spear, he would kill him sooner or later!
          In the past two years, he had lost by a small margin. However, in the past two years, he had been a superhuman and had improved even faster. He did not believe that the Golden spear would improve as fast as him.
         Seeing that the big-bearded man was extremely irascible, he looked at the others and was also eager to make a move.
         The white-robed man was silent for a moment before saying,""Then you should take some brothers with you. Be careful. If anything goes wrong, retreat quickly ... Remember, don't stay on land for long!"
         "Don't worry!" The bearded man was overjoyed."We'll come back after we're done!"
         He finally agreed!
         The next moment, the big-bearded man couldn't wait and roared,""Let's go to Silver Moon to loot. We'll kill, set fire, and sleep with our wives. Silver Moon may be poor, but his women are all very tender. Hahaha, and there's also the Silver Moon Martial Master. She's full of energy. Brothers, let's go!"
         "Third master is mighty!"
         The group of people shouted in a disorderly manner and followed the big-bearded man out. There were still a few large ships outside.
         After they had left, a man wearing a mask walked out from behind the man in white. His voice was slightly hoarse."You know how cunning hou Xiaochen is, so you must've made some preparations after leaving. You even sent hai Sha to Silver Moon. That's not logical!"
         The white-robed man said calmly,"if you're rational, you're not a pirate!" If we keep holding it in, hai Sha will soon rebel. Do we have to wait for him to rebel and then kill each other?"
         The masked man fell silent. He didn't say anything more, but reminded,""General Bai, this naval force is very useful to us. Don't lose too many of our forces. Although the sea sharks are violent, they are not weak. They are also brave and good at fighting. The White shark Guards are also an important force for us to obtain treasures in the sea ..."
         "I don't need you to remind me."
         White shark said,"if you're still worried ... You can secretly bring some people and follow them. Be careful and stay away from them. It's fine if there's no problem. If there's a problem, you can help them in time." As for Silver Moon, if he doesn't go to Whitemoon city, it shouldn't be a big problem. As long as hai Sha doesn't let his desire get to his head and leaves Silver Moon in time, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. "
         The masked man thought for a while and nodded.""Then I'll bring some people with me to avoid any trouble."
         After saying that, he didn't continue talking about the sea shark but talked about something else,"The higher-ups have sent an order for us to gather all the pirate forces in the North Sea as soon as possible ..."
         Great White frowned,"I know, but it's not that simple!" There are now seven famous pirate clans in the North Sea, and with us, there are eight in total. Each clan is guarded by Xuguang, and the sea demon Pirates even have the help of a few great water demons ... They're extremely difficult to deal with!"
         The White shark Pirates were strong, but they were only ranked fourth on the surface. The first three clans were all very powerful, and they even had a peak stage sunrise.
         It was extremely difficult to deal with!
         White shark was a little annoyed at the thought of this, but he also knew that there was a lot of power above him. If he did not agree, it would be very troublesome even if he was in the sea.
         "If we want to unite the others, we'll need some support, and ... The other families might have some support. The North Sea pirates are powerful. Without the support of some people on land, it won't be easy for them to reach this stage. As far as I know, the sea demon Pirates might be secretly supported by the governor's office in Linjiang ..."
         "Linjiang governor's mansion?"
         The masked man snorted,"don't worry about it!" The one in Linjiang had only just entered the transformation stage. There were less than 10 people in Linjiang province's Sunglow. He was rather ambitious. He did not consider that being in the North, with Silver Moon and the three northern provinces in front of him ... How could he have the qualifications to establish himself in Linjiang province? He still wants to become independent? the day he becomes independent will be the day he seeks death!"
         He was disdainful of the Overlord of Linjiang.
         White shark was a little puzzled,'he's already in the metamorphosis stage? How could he be so fast ... Even the previous general kou wasn't able to break through ..."
          The masked man shook his head."I don't know. Perhaps someone is secretly supporting him. I've also received information from the higher-ups to make him stronger. Perhaps it's to resist Silver Moon and seal off some of Silver moon's men!"  Linjiang was adjacent to Silver Moon, and silver Moon was an extremely important place, so someone had long since begun to lay out the plan.
         Great White frowned and did not say anything else.
         "You don't have to worry too much," the masked man said."You don't have to worry about the supporters behind it. It's enough as long as you can unite the forces of the entire sea area. Only by controlling the North Sea can you restrict the entire North ..."
         White shark didn't take it too seriously. They'd be overestimating themselves if they expected us to completely seal off the North Sea.
         After all, Pirates were still bandits.
         If the 19 northern provinces really wanted to enter the central region, the pirate forces would not be able to stop them.
         "Oh, right ..."
         At this moment, the masked man seemed to have thought of something.""I heard that Yuan Shuo's disciple, the inheritor of the eight great families, Li Hao, is still in white moon City. If you can capture Li Hao, then do your best to capture him! This person is very important, and he has a precious treasure in his hands. Moreover, the people of the red moon have been watching him. Not only is the treasure valuable, but this person is also very important!"
         Great White nodded slightly and did not say anything.
         As long as the other party was in Whitemoon city ... He would not go there. It would be more or less the same if he came out.
         So, no matter what the masked man said, he didn't care too much. He just had to deal with it first. There were definitely other experts in Whitemoon city. Although he was strong, he didn't have the confidence to deal with an expert on hou Xiaochen's level.
         The masked man spoke for a while more and left quickly. He led his men to track hai Sha.
         Hai Sha's combat strength wasn't weak, so it was best not to die Here.
         ……
         At the same time.
         Li Hao also finished reading some information and let out a sigh of relief. He did not expect that there would be so many Pirates in the North Sea. According to the information left by golden spear and the others, there were more than a hundred pirate forces in the vast North Sea.
         Among them, eight were extremely powerful. Not only did they have Sunglow experts, but they even had peak Sunglow experts.
         In the past two years, the Wei Wu Army had encountered one of the more famous pirates, the White shark Pirates. It was said that their leader, white shark, was an extremely powerful fellow. However, they had not encountered them last time. Instead, they had met the other party's third commander, who was also a rising light expert.
         The three great leaders of the White shark Pirates were actually all Xu Guang, with over ten thousand people. The third commander had brought over a thousand people to raid the White moon City ... In the end, they were repelled by the Wei Wu Army, and Jin Jin had almost killed that guy, but someone had managed to escape.
         That time, the Wei Wu Army had also lost many people.
         However, in the past two years, the other party did not dare to invade the lunar Sea again.
         "There are so many rays of light in the sea?"
         A pirate force actually had three Xuguang commanders? Li Hao frowned slightly. If they were so powerful, how many Xuguang commanders were there in the entire North Sea?
          How could he be so strong!
         After a long time, Li Hao narrowed his eyes. Perhaps ... It wasn't just the Pirates, but some other people were secretly supporting him.
         It was good to raise bandits for self-respect, or they had other plans ... In any case, Li Hao had seen through the great forces, great figures, and great families.
         Not many of them were good!
         Otherwise, why would so many sunrises be Pirates?
         On the land, he could be an Overlord. Whether he joined the three major organizations or the nine divisions, he would not be doing too badly.
         "Now that Minister hou and the others have left ... It seems like these people won't be able to hold back ... Should they take the initiative to attack?"
         Li Hao fell into deep thought. A moment later, he made a decision ... He could go and take a look first. The sea ... He had never gone deep into it before.
         It's good to get used to it.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Who asked him not to leave? at this moment, Li Hao was somewhat regretful. If he had known, he would have left too and let those old cunning guys do their own thing.
        
         At the base square.
         Li Hao walked out. It was already dark.
         This was the first day that hou Xiaochen and the others had left.
         The demon hunt squad was still training, and these people were all working very hard. Perhaps it was out of habit, or perhaps it was because they had witnessed Li Hao's strength, and wanted to become stronger.
         Be it swords gate or the inspector, these people were all of low status.
         There were orphans, ordinary people in society, and people who had accidentally come into contact with martial arts. They all came from the bottom. Other than Hong Qing, no one else had a high status. Even Hong Qing did not feel anything special.
         Because, growing up in swords gate, other than Hong Yitang's love for her, there was nothing special about her.
         She still had to do the laundry and cook for herself.
         She wasn't the heiress of a rich family as everyone had imagined. Thus, she didn't stop her daily cultivation tasks even though she had recently comprehended Shi.
          As Li Hao walked over, everyone stopped what they were doing.
         Li Hao glanced at the crowd, thought for a moment, and said,""By staying here, we've accepted a mission to strengthen our coastal defense! "Pirates are the enemies we need to face. You may not know much about Pirates ..."
         Before he could finish his words, a swords gate disciple in the crowd suddenly gritted his teeth and said,""I know Pirates! I'm from the North Sea, and the North Sea was once invaded by Pirates. They committed all kinds of evil, such as burning, killing, plundering, massacring cities and clans, and killing for fun! They were all animals among animals! Before I entered the swords gate, the city I was in was completely destroyed by the Pirates, leaving only a few elderly, women, and children who managed to survive ...."
         Li Hao didn't expect to encounter any survivors that had been invaded by Pirates.
         He was slightly surprised, but he also knew that he was probably an orphan taken in by Hong Yitang from the North Sea. Now, he had grown up and become a Martial Master.
         The young man gritted his teeth and said,"Captain, I'll be the first to register to kill Pirates!" "But ... I know how brutal and inhumane Pirates can be. Silver Moon doesn't have many coastal areas, and they're always guarded by the Wei Wu Army, so they don't have a deep understanding of Pirates. If Captain wants to face the Pirates, you have to be careful. Also ... You have to be careful of Pirates threatening us ..."
         Li Hao was confused."What threat?"
         "A city-wide massacre threat!"
         The young man gritted his teeth and said,"don't compromise!" Back then, the city I was in also had a superpower, but the pirate leader threatened the city's supers. If they surrendered, he would only take their belongings, and if they resisted, he would destroy the city! In the end, the supers in the city felt that they were no match for them ... And chose to compromise ... In the end ... They all died, not a single one was left alive!"
         Li Hao was stunned."How can we compromise in front of a great enemy ..."
         The young man was depressed."Yes, but ... In the face of the brutal and powerful Pirates, everyone is still afraid. They don't dare to risk their lives and hope that they will leave after taking their belongings. After all, killing people is useless to them. They don't have many superpowers and are just ordinary people. What's the point of killing them?"  This was also what many people were thinking."I'm not a threat to you, and I don't have any money, so why would you kill me?"
         But ... Would a reasonable and humane pirate still be a Bandit?
         It was just killing for fun!
         They only wanted to see your despair and painful wails, and that was enough.
         "But, Captain, Pirates are a bunch of beasts. They don't care about this. Their superpowers will even research all kinds of killing methods to kill ordinary people. They will roast, freeze, bury, crack the Ice and Fire, cut open the intestines and stomach ..."
         The more the young man spoke, the more agitated he became. He was extremely angry."These animals won't stop because of your screams. They'll only get more and more excited! "They just kill for fun, not for cultivation or treasures. In most cities, the only things that are useful to them are food, clothes, and daily necessities. If they really want these, people will give them, but they also want women ... When that time comes, there will actually be ... Actually be people willing to contribute ..."
         Li Hao frowned slightly, but he didn't say anything.
         The young man continued,"but they are not satisfied with this. They are cruel in their bones!" My sister was only five years old at that time ... They ..."
         The young man gritted his teeth and did not continue.
          "What's your name?"Li Hao asked.
         He didn't try to hide it. He really didn't remember this person's name. When he first came, he seemed to be only in the ten-realm, but Li Hao remembered quite a few people who had broken through 100. At the time, he didn't pay much attention to the ten-realm.
         "Hong Chou!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao glanced at him. Hong, Hong Yitang's Hong.
         Enmity ... The enmity of losing one's family?
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He simply nodded and continued,""Because the Pirates might attack, I want to enter the sea to observe and get used to the sea battle. Everyone is unfamiliar with the sea, and it's difficult to fight in the sea with a hundred martial masters. But no matter what, since we've accepted the mission, do you think we should go and take a look?"
         Everyone looked at each other. Soon, Hong Qing said,""Of course we're going! Captain, disciples of swords gate, since you have joined a demon hunt squad, you naturally won't back down!"
         In the distance, Wang Henggang's nephew, the burly Wang Chao, also said in a muffled voice,"Those who come from the inspection Office are not afraid of death. If they are afraid of death, they won't eat a bowl of rice from the inspection Office!"
         At this time, Liu Long opened his mouth,"we're all demon hunt squad members now, there's no need to be so clear about it."
        
         After saying this, he looked at Li Hao and said,"it's fine as long as Captain gives the order. The number one military Order of the Wei Wu Army is to obey orders, and in heaven battling city, the number one military Order of the heaven battling Army is also to obey military orders. Since we've joined the Wei Wu Army's demon hunt squad, as long as Captain doesn't make a random decision, whether it's to kill enemies or to go to war ... We'll obey!"[ 1]
         "I've never managed so many people before, so I'm not used to it. "
         Li Hao smiled and glanced at the crowd. After a while, he said,""Then let's go out to sea and have a look. It's better to go early than late. Minister hou's departure may have aroused some people's interest. We'll set off tonight ... Everyone, prepare some food and water."
         After he finished speaking, he thought of something and suddenly threw out a pile of storage rings,""Each of you can choose one, they are all storage rings."
         Everyone was stunned.
         Hong Qing and the others were also stunned. Storage ring?
         They knew this.
         However, looking at the pile of storage rings in front of them, they were all dumbfounded. These things, only the three suns had them. It was not that only the three suns could use them, but only the three suns could afford to buy them and keep them.
         However, how many were there in front of him?
         Fifty or sixty?
          Or even more!
         "Guild leader, this ..."
         "Some of my spoils from before."
         Li Hao smiled."I don't need it. It's useless to have too many. I'll just keep a few for myself. Everyone, bring more food and drinks. And the black Phoenix. I can't keep it in my body right now." However, when I activate the black banner, it can also transform into a small ball. It will be much more convenient then. "
         Li Hao hadn't activated it yet.
         The black banner couldn't be kept in the body, but after it was activated, it could turn into a ball, but it was much bigger than the silver and copper banners. It was a little more complicated, and even if it turned into a ball, it was still the size of a head.
         This thing could only be kept in a storage ring, or it would be inconvenient to carry it around.
         The copper armor was different. One didn't need to wear it and could appear instantly. The silver armor could be kept in one's body. The black armor was complicated because one had to open the ball, turn it into an armor, and put it on ...
         It couldn't be helped. Back then, the heaven-battling Army had been too large, and black Phoenix had been the main force. They probably hadn't put much effort into building it, but even so, it was still very strong.
         As soon as he said that, everyone's interest was piqued.""It can turn into a ball?"
         "Activate? Does it have any special effects?"
         “……”
         Everyone was in high spirits. Li Hao smiled and said,""I don't know what special effect it has, but there's one good thing. I can contact everyone within a thousand miles through the black banner, and the defensive power will be enhanced. In addition, if you want to form the ten ring Mountain sealing array, the black banner will be more conducive to the formation. When the heaven battling Army formed the array, it was also instantly formed. It's extremely powerful, and the armor can help everyone to form the array successfully."
         This was the information he had seen on the silver armor, but the heaven battling Army was no longer able to make it.
         In order to form a formation, one needed to link their Qi, blood, and inner strength together. However, the heaven-battling Army had long since died, and only their obsessions remained. Naturally, they could not form a formation. Otherwise, even with their current strength, the 3000 heaven-battling Army would have been able to easily take down those Sunglows.
          This was the most terrifying part!  After losing their physical bodies, the heaven-battling Army's strength had long been reduced to less than 10%.
         Everyone was overjoyed. It could be done this way?
         On the other side, Liu Long laughed and suddenly took out a large black ball. The black ball instantly turned into an armor. He then quickly opened the armor and put it on,"Mine has been activated before. It's quite convenient and much stronger than before."
         "Previously, the black banner had a decent defense against the sunlight but barely any defense against the three suns. However, I discovered that the quality of this black banner is extremely good. As long as one has sufficient Qi, blood, and inner strength, even the three suns can't break through its defense!"
         Everyone was shocked. So terrifying?
         Li Hao also said,"its defensive power is still very strong. It's just that before it was activated, and without the help of the energy in heaven battling city, its defensive power was much weaker. Now that it's activated, it should be much stronger."
         "Also, this black banner ... It might be able to allow people to fly."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Everyone was stunned again. Flying?
         Martial masters couldn't fly when they broke through the 100-point threshold. When they reached the thousand-point threshold, they could use the divine intent to walk in the air like birds. However, martial masters who broke through the 100-point threshold could only rely on the strength of their feet to soar into the air.
         For a short period of time, he could only fly ... But he had no choice.
         Li Hao said uncertainly,"I haven't tried to break through a hundred points, but vice commander Liu and I can do it. It's just that we can do it, so it's hard to tell if it's the black Phoenix. I haven't fully mastered the black Phoenix's abilities yet."
         Everyone became even more excited.
         Li Hao continued,"also, Black Phoenix is a completely sealed system. Perhaps it can also fight in the sea. Of course, it's still the same. It's just my speculation ... You can try it out later."
         In fact, Li Hao was also surprised by the armor's versatility, but there was nothing to say about the strength of the ancient civilization.
          ……
         Li Hao walked out of the square and into the office.
         At this moment, a few people were waiting for Li Hao.
         When Wang Ming saw Li Hao, he chuckled."Senior brother ..."
         "Call me guild leader!"
         “……”
         Wang Ming was speechless and could only say,"Regiment commander, Li Meng and Hu Hao have arrived."
         "I see it."
         Li Hao looked at them. Yunyao was as quiet as ever. Seeing Li Hao, she nodded slightly, appearing elegant and quiet.
         Li Meng, who had always been a little brainless, was extremely excited at this moment.""Senior brother ... Regiment commander ... Minister ... Forget it, I'll just call him Regiment commander. As expected, Regiment commander is the most benevolent and righteous person. He didn't forget us even when he's rich ..."
        
         When they went to the Silver City, the three of them had some complaints. Later, they were forced to take Yuan Shuo as their disciple, and they felt a little uncomfortable.
         But now ... They were all extremely excited.
         Hu Hao was much quieter. Like yunyao, he didn't say much. When he saw Li Hao, he called in a low voice,""Guild leader."
         At this moment, the three of them were all at the full moon level, but they were only comparable to the late stage of the breakthrough 100. They still needed to enter the full moon level to reach the peak of the breakthrough 100. They had not even entered the sun glory level.
         In fact, it was already not slow, but it also depended on who he was compared to.
         Compared to Wang Ming, the gap between them wasn't big before, but now Wang Ming was already in the late stage of the solar glory realm. If he didn't control himself, he would probably be at the peak of the solar realm and break through to the three suns realm.
         Li Hao waved his hand, and four sets of armor appeared.""Put them on. This armor has some ability to suppress superpowers but it can also block the detection of superpowers."
         The heaven battling Army was not an energy Army.
         It was said that there was a special energy Army.
         Black Phoenix had some restrictions on them, but Li Hao didn't expect them to fight. It would be enough if they could provide him with some support.
          "I'm going on a mission tonight. You know what happened before. It's going to be dangerous. You ..."
         "I have no objections!"
         "As long as I can become as strong as senior brother Wang, I'm willing to do anything!" Li Meng shrieked.
         “……”
         Li Hao was speechless. This woman was the most unreliable one among all the superpowers he had seen. In the past, she had been looking around and even saw Yuan Shuo teaching disciples. Yuan Shuo had almost beaten her to death, but she still hadn't changed.
         "How far can you see with your third eye?" Li Hao asked.
         "About a thousand meters?"
         Li Meng wasn't too sure either."I've never tried to see exactly how far."
         Li Hao nodded slightly. Not bad.
         In fact, he could also see the orbs of light. What was scary was that if the other party was a Martial Master, Li Hao wouldn't be able to see them clearly. On the other hand, as a Martial Master, Li Meng could see the other party in person.
         Therefore, within a thousand meters, Li Hao could see superpowers, while Li Meng could see martial masters. This formed a complementary effect and effectively prevented enemies from approaching.
         However, he was still too close.
         A thousand meters was too close. Li Meng was right, but when Li Hao looked at the rising light now, there was nothing to block it. He could see the light from thousands of meters away.
         "Sister Yun, you are a Water-type cultivator and are good at healing. You should be able to treat the internal injuries of ordinary martial masters, right?"
         "Sure."  Yunyao nodded slightly."As long as it's not a serious internal injury, it can be treated."
         That's good.
         He looked at Hu Hao. Hu Hao's ability was relatively simple. He could fly. In fact, when a Martial Master became a warrior of the universe, the flying element seemed to be of little value.
         These special systems of superpowers were actually very interesting.
         They didn't unlock the five organs or their limbs. They might have unlocked some special superpower lock, but Li Hao couldn't tell where it was. The sky ability might be a variant of the wind ability, but the wind ability was also a special system and didn't belong to the five elements system.
         These people might have unlocked some undiscovered superpower locks in their bodies, because Li Hao had strengthened his body with wind-type superpower.
         As for Li Meng's third eye ... It was even more special. Who knew which Super Lock he had unlocked?
         These people actually had a lot of potential.
         At least from Li Hao's perspective, special abilities had great potential because they had already unlocked some special locks. If they could see other super locks, when they were still looking for other super locks, they would be one level higher when everyone else had already unlocked the ordinary super locks.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Of course, that was an extremely distant matter.
         At the very least, he already knew about his limbs and organs. These special types of powers would not be able to do anything to him without opening eight or nine superpower locks.
         However, if it was difficult to open the five viscera, these people could also take the initiative and open one of the five viscera meridians while others were still opening the second one. There would be no conflict.
         While Li Hao was still thinking, Wang Ming said somewhat excitedly, "You're going on a mission tonight? Where to?"
         "I'm not telling you. You have a big mouth. "
          Wang Ming was instantly depressed. He didn't have a big mouth, so why was he spouting nonsense?
         Li Hao considered for a moment and said,"you guys should quickly cultivate. I don't want you to enter the sunlit stage. It's fine if you can enter the full moon stage. After all, you're at the peak of the Dark Moon stage. Full moon is a bit weak."
         With that, he waved his hand and crushed some divine power stones. The next moment, a pure elemental power emerged.
         The water element went to yunyao, and the wind element went to Hu Hao. As for Li Meng, Li Hao didn't know what kind of elements he could use to improve her. He gave her five elements, including some wind and thunder, some dark elements, and some non-elemental ones.
         "Try to absorb it and see which one is the best. This is no ordinary mystic energy. You can absorb whichever one you think is the best for your improvement."
         What was the nature of this third eye?
         Li Hao was actually very curious.
         He had seen a lot of superpowers before. There were ice, dark, and support superpowers, but he had never seen a third eye grow out of thin air. He did not know if the third eye was a real eye or just an external manifestation.
         Li Meng was already used to it and didn't care about it.
         She absorbed a little of each and was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth. It was actually more difficult for her to level up than for others, which was why she could cultivate to the level of full moon. In fact, in terms of absorption efficiency, she might even be a little better than Wang Ming.
        
         Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to enter Dark Moon. After all, Wang Ming and the others clearly knew how to improve. Li Meng was muddleheaded, so she just absorbed it randomly.
         At this moment, the others were still normal.
         Li Meng tried every type of energy and was extremely excited.""So powerful. Any one of them is stronger than the attribute-less ones I absorbed before."
         Li Hao, however, frowned. Was there no special energy element that was compatible with it?
         When Yun Yao absorbed the water element, Li Hao could see her orbs getting stronger. When Hu Hao absorbed the wind element, although the effect was not as good, his orbs were still getting stronger.
         Li Meng was the only one who was growing stronger, but the efficiency was very low!
         Perhaps to Li Meng, this speed was already very fast, but to Li Hao, who could clearly see some changes, he still felt that it was too slow.
         These were all superpowers he had known in the early days, and they were even in-name disciples of Yuan Shuo ... Even though Yuan Shuo had only wanted to pave the way for Li Hao, he had not expected Li Hao to improve so quickly.
         However, since he had already accepted it, there was no need to regret it.
         Now, everyone was improving quickly, but Li Meng was a superpower, yet his progress was so slow. This made Li Hao fall into deep thought. If this continued, the other superpowers might attain three suns, and Li Meng could enter the solar system.
          It might get harder and harder later on.
         While he was still thinking, his ears twitched. A dog appeared beside him. At this moment, Black Panther ran over as well. He just wanted to get some food because he felt the energy leaking from this place.
         However, seeing that there wasn't much energy left, it lost interest. It was still more comfortable and full from eating before.
         At this moment, the Black Panther's skin was smooth and could not be compared to its previous skin and bones.
         It wagged its tail and its nose twitched. It glanced at Li Meng but didn't pay him any attention.
         They listened to Li Hao in silence.
         Li Hao was also having a headache."I can't tell what attribute you have from your third eye. You absorb all kinds of energy, but it seems that your speed of improvement is the same. There's no energy that matches you ... Troublesome."
         Li Meng was indifferent."It's already very fast. The regiment commander is still the best!"
         As for the Black Panther, it wagged its tail and glanced at Li Meng.
         At this moment, in the mind that was only focused on eating, a vague image seemed to appear ... But it was only a flash. The Black Panther was a little puzzled and looked at Li Meng again.
         Just like that, he watched it back and forth several times.
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         The Black Panther suddenly barked at Li Meng.
         Li Hao lowered his head and looked at the Black Panther. Seeing the Black Panther call out to Li Meng, he felt a little strange. "What's wrong?"
         "Woof!"
         The Black Panther circled around Li Meng, seemingly a little confused. The next moment, it seemed to have thought of something and barked at Li Hao!
         Li Hao's head hurt. It was a powerful dog, but it couldn't talk.
         How would I know what you meant?
         Sometimes, he could understand a little, but sometimes, he really didn 't.
         For example, now ... You're barking at Li Meng. How would I know what you're saying?
          Heibao was also depressed!  The next moment, as if he had thought of something, he suddenly glared at Li Hao."Awoo!"
         He was like an angry dog. At this moment, a fierce golden dog appeared in Li Hao's mind ...
         He was slightly dazed and surprised.
         "You ... You've really become a Martial Master dog?"
         Was this the will of the gods?
         This dog ... Was really strange.
         Its physical body was also terrifyingly strong. He wondered who in the city had modified it to be ridiculously strong.
         Divine intent ... Was this dog showing off to him?
         The next moment, Li Hao moved slightly. He thought of something and looked at Li Meng, then at Black Panther. He suddenly understood."You mean ... Her ... Is a mutation of her spiritual system?" he asked.
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         Heibao nodded his head hurriedly. He was very excited as he finally understood.
         It actually didn't understand, but just now, it seemed to have suddenly thought of something. It didn't know how it came to mind, but it just felt that this third eye was a little familiar. It probably seemed to be some kind of mental power.
         Li Hao's heart was also moved. Heavenly eye cultivator?
         Yes, he thought of this at this moment.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hou Xiaochen had mentioned it before, and Li Hao had asked Nanquan some questions. According to Li Hao's judgment, the people who had seen the Red Shadows before were all heavenly-eyed cultivators, and it wasn't easy for them to become stronger.
         However, once one stepped into the cultivation system, especially after breaking through some barriers, they would become extremely terrifying.
         A heavenly eye cultivator. Hong Yue seemed to have had one too, but unfortunately, he died very quickly. He was killed by director Wang with one strike.
         As for himself ... Li Hao had asked around and found that he was different.
         He didn't ask further.
          Could Li Meng be a heavenly eye cultivator?
         However, he had never heard of a heavenly eye cultivator opening a third eye.
         Also, it was said that cultivators with heavenly eyes were hard to control and could easily self-destruct when they cultivated. Li Meng didn't show this.
         Li Hao was a little confused, but he didn't think about it.
         As for the spirit-type ... It would not be easy to level it up. Up until now, he had not even tested out what kind of power could be extracted to strengthen the Divine Will.
         He did have some spirit accumulation fruits, but Li Hao hadn't tried them yet. Naturally, he wouldn't give them to others.
         Li Hao paid more attention to Li Meng's third eye, but he had no choice but to say,""You should cultivate first, it's good to be faster than before."
         At least it was faster than before, but he had no other choice now.
         ……
         Ignoring this, Li Hao went to the warehouse and took away the remaining divine power stones.
        
         After some consideration, he thought of Hao lianchuan.
         If I go out tonight, I wonder if I'll encounter Pirates ... Should I call that guy?
         That guy had three suns and was not weak.
         The main thing was that Hao lianchuan had been so excited to follow them ... He thought about it and shook his head. 'Forget it, next time.'
         This time, he was only going out to take a look, not to fight.
         Besides, if he ran away after he left, he didn't know who to look for if something happened to the night patrolmen.
         At this moment, Li Hao gave up on the idea of calling this fatty along.
         Let's talk about it next time.
         ……
         Soon, night fell.
          Late at night.
         Apart from Li Hao, the rest of the 55 wore black armors. There were originally 51 people, but now that there were four more supers, Li Hao had them wear black armors to prevent their powers from leaking.
         At this moment, Li Hao had activated their Black Phoenix.
         There was a benefit to activating black armor. Li Hao no longer needed to be lectured. Instead, he could send a message through the armor."Everyone can receive my communication. I'll now give everyone the right to communicate with me ... But don't chat with me unless it's necessary ... From now on, everyone should try to remain silent. If there's anything, just contact me internally in the armor."
         The group of martial masters didn't have any aura to begin with, and with the addition of their armor, they could communicate with each other even if they didn't use voice transmission. In this way, this demon hunt squad was in a state of complete silence.
         "We're just going out to sea tonight to familiarize ourselves with the situation. If we encounter a small group of Pirates, it'll be better for us to practice ..."He said.
         Li Hao didn't say anything else after he sent the message through the armor.
         During their last mission, they had followed Li Hao for a few days. Now, they were familiar with Li Hao's style. They didn't say anything, but acted more like an Army. Although they weren't as disciplined as the heaven battling Army, they weren't any worse than the Wei Wu Army.
         The four new supers were working with Liu Long, so they were considered supernumerary personnel.
         The group of 55 people quickly disappeared into the darkness.
         p This place was not far from the coastline.  A moment later, they arrived at the coastline. Li Hao waved his hand, and a ship as dark as a ghost instantly appeared on the sea. This ship was slightly special, as it seemed to have wings on both sides.
         A ship that could fly!
         Everyone was also curious. What was this thing?
         The next moment, seeing Li Hao board the ship, everyone got on. The ship wasn't very big, but when they got on, they found that the interior of the ship was very large.
          Li Hao didn't say anything. He entered the cockpit at the bow and stuffed a few divine power stones into a hole. After fiddling with it for a while, he entered a map into the display of the origin god weapon.  "Just follow the route and stop at the intersection of the moon sea and the North Sea. Conceal your aura. The whole journey is about three thousand miles ... You are an origin god weapon, so you shouldn't be too slow, right?"
         There was no response.
         Li Hao didn't care. At this moment, he looked at the sea outside through the steering room. At night, the sea was dark. Ordinary ships could easily get into trouble when they went out at night without any lights.
         However, for the origin god weapon, as long as it had enough energy, such a problem would not exist.
         Soon, the flying giant venomous ship shot out like an arrow and disappeared into the sea.
         ……
         After Li Hao left, it was frighteningly quiet.
         Even the few superpowers in the base did not realize that they had left. The group of martial masters were dressed in black armor and they were silent. When they passed through the artificial forest, they deliberately avoided the surveillance cameras. Even after they had all left, the base was still quiet, waiting for the sunrise the next day.
         On the first day of hou Xiaochen's departure, everyone thought that Li Hao would stay at the base quietly for at least a few days. No one expected that Li Hao would run away with his men that night.
         The black boat was like a shadow in the sea, silent and undetectable. Even if there were people monitoring the nearby waters, they wouldn't be able to find anything.
         ……
         At this time, hou Xiaochen's group had not gone far.
         He did not stop for a day.
         This fleet had just left Linjiang province and headed for Beihai province. They did not stop all night. If they wanted to cross Beihai, they would have to wait until the next afternoon or even night.
          It was also because he hadn't gone too far and hadn't completely left the North that big Beard's pirate crew didn't dare to get close to the Silver Moon. Only when hou Xiaochen had completely left the North Sea would that guy dare to.
         That night, the Pirates led by the bearded man were like wild horses that had broken free of their reins. They ransacked a small coastal town, but there was not much movement because almost all the residents in the town had been killed.
         ……
         The car was still jolting.
         Within the carriage, hou Xiaochen opened his eyes and looked around. At this moment, the carriage was about to enter the North Sea province, but this place looked very desolate, even more so than the Silver Moon region.
         On both sides of the road ... One could even vaguely see some skeletons.
         Chief Yu said softly,"we are about to enter the North Sea. The three northern provinces have been in a mess these days. However, as the Wei Wu Army is advancing, those people will not dare to provoke us."
         Hou Xiaochen nodded.
         His line of sight stopped on both sides of the road. The road was full of potholes. Sometimes, he could even hear a soft cry in the distance in the dark. It was very far away, but his ears were good, so he could still hear it.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was October, and the weather in the North Sea had started to turn cold.
