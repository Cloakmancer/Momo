Eight rank eights surrounded him.The human King was extremely decisive. At this moment, he gathered all his power and was about to self-destruct."Neo martial artists never die without any achievements!"The human King laughed wildly and charged at Fu Sheng."Rat, how can you kill me? are you even worthy?"Venerable monarch fleeting life was terrified!After being killed by the human King last time, he had long been afraid like a tiger. Today, the eight Supremes surrounded the human King's side, and he dared to be unscrupulous. At this moment, the human king self-destructed and came straight for him. Even the chaotic level eight who had been blocking him all this time actually retreated a little.Fu Sheng was even more terrified!"No..."If they died again, they would not be able to revive. Even if they were revived, they might only be able to live for a few days, or they might even die on the spot.He quickly retreated!"Stop him!" The reincarnation Emperor shouted from behind."Stop him!"At this moment, the expression on the reincarnation sovereign's face changed slightly. Fu Sheng was afraid. He was afraid. A rank eight venerable sovereign had a strong will. However, Fu Sheng had been killed by a human King before. Naturally, he was afraid of a human King.At this moment, they actually made way for him.As for the human King, his aura skyrocketed. In an instant, with a loud boom, a wave of energy spread in all directions. The human King's flesh and blood exploded, revealing a golden bone armor.Like a skeleton, he instantly shuttled out from the direction that Fu Sheng had dodged to and escaped the encirclement!"Hahaha!"The human King's maniacal laughter resounded through the heavens and earth.Self-destruction?Self-destruction? I'm not going to die yet.'I knew this Fu Sheng wouldn't dare to stop me. I made the right bet again. I broke out of the encirclement of five tier 8 experts. Although I haven't completely escaped from the encirclement, I've exchanged my flesh and blood for a moment of breathing space ... It's worth it for the human King.'"Rat!"The human King laughed with boundless savagery!The retreating Fu Sheng's face was pale. The reincarnation Emperor also appeared with an ugly expression. Fu Sheng had been killed by the human King, causing him to fear the human King. This was a huge loophole.If the human King had not been surrounded this time and had encountered Fu Sheng alone, he might not have needed to go through so much trouble like last time. He might have been able to kill Fu Sheng with one strike."Calm down!""What are you afraid of?" the reincarnation Emperor shouted with a cold face.Even if he self-destructed ... Well, he was a little worried just now, but he was still an eighth-tier master. If he really self-destructed, the five eighth-tier Masters would join forces to stop him, and he might not be killed by the explosion. On the contrary, if this continued, once the human King escaped from the encirclement, it would be the biggest trouble! "Fu Sheng, you deal with Silver Moon!""Go!" Reincarnation monarch shouted in a low voice. He didn't want this guy to continue surrounding the killer king. His presence might still be a loophole. It might be better for him to go over there.Venerable sovereign fleeting life's face turned pale. He glanced at the human King, who was frantically escaping but was suppressed by the reincarnation monarch. He gritted his teeth and turned to leave.He couldn't stay.Yes, he was afraid.He knew that the human King had already become the demon in his heart, but ... He could not face the human King. When he encountered the human King alone and the human King appeared before his eyes, he could only feel fear!At that moment, he even felt as if his mind was being torn apart.Venerable sovereign fleeting life's eyes were a little cold. Instead of looking at the human King, he looked at Li Hao ... At this moment, Li Hao was still dealing with the specters. The three level 8s were all dealt with by others, but Li Hao was almost invincible among the specters. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Even the strongest spirit would find it difficult to restrain Li Hao.Since he couldn't kill the human King, he couldn't match the enemy King, and he could be easily targeted by the human King ...Venerable monarch fleeting life instantly disappeared and went straight for Li Hao.In the distance, the human King had just escaped from the encirclement. At this moment, he was struggling on his last breath, buying himself a little bit of time. After consuming a lot of flesh and blood, the Golden skeleton was in a fierce battle, and once again, it was in a fierce battle.With one less level 8 targeting him, it was a little better than before ... But Fu Sheng went to Li Hao's side. Obviously, for Li Hao, facing a level 8 was probably an endless pressure!The human King didn't say anything, either. He was focused on escaping in the opposite direction of Li Hao. At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor was really angry. His voice was cold and indifferent."Silver Moon King, the human King is only focused on escaping. If he really does escape, I'm afraid you all will have no way out. Are you all going to sacrifice yourself for this guy? Thunderlord, Wushan, and daoqi, you ... Are you willing to sacrifice yourselves for an unrelated person?""Huntian Supreme Emperor has already entered the ninth rank. With the help of my reincarnation, he will be able to unify the chaos and create a truly unified world! Aren't you going to think about your future?"As he attacked mercilessly, he divided the forces.These people came from different worlds, not the same world. Since that was the case ... Why couldn't they be divided?Not to mention a different world, even if it was the same world, when death was certain, it was very normal for people to betray.The eight rank eights had besieged four rank eights, and some rank Sevens had failed to kill them. This was a failure for the Samsara Emperor.Fortunately, the human King had used up all his flesh and blood, so his battle prowess was weakened once again.On the other side, Fu Sheng had already arrived at the battlefield, and together with the spirit, they began to surround and kill the tier 7 Silver Moon King. They had the absolute advantage everywhere, and if this continued, these people would soon be completely annihilated!The human King retreated as he fought, and his bone armor began to crack.The long blade had already shattered.At this moment, his most troublesome opponent was not the reincarnation Emperor. In order to construct the Dao domain around them to prevent them from escaping, the reincarnation Emperor had not been able to use his full strength.

Chapter 3431 Cooperation (Part 2)
The biggest problem was the Chaos Beast. An eighth-grade Chaos Beast had at least the strength of 4000 Dao laws. This wasn't the main point. Such strength was inferior to that of a human King. The main point was that the other party's physical body was strong.If the human King were to fight with the other party alone, he would naturally be able to win. However, with his heavy injuries and being suppressed by the other party's physical body, the space for him to move around was once again compressed. It looked like the situation was about to return to what it was before.The flesh and blood on his body had exploded for nothing.The human King cursed in his heart!Normally, this demon would have killed him.But now ... The difficulty was very high.Did old Zhang and big cat go to Samsara's home ground or were they coming to help?He really couldn't hold on any longer!​ ……At this moment, Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief.The human King didn't self-destruct.This was good. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  It had been too fast just now. He was shocked and thought that the human King was going to self-destruct. He turned his head and thought about it. In the past, when he had traveled to neo martial, how could a person like the human King give up hope so easily?Back then, no matter how many dangers he had encountered, he had never committed suicide, let alone now.The other party had also experienced many false self-destructions.Feigning death and intimidation were all done by these human Kings. He couldn't forget how shameless the former human Kings were just because of his reputation today. He was obviously just intimidating just now, and as expected, Fu Sheng was scared away ...It's just that ... This Fu Sheng who was scared away came to my place.That's good!At least the human King was relieved.Just as he was thinking about this, a punch came. Venerable sovereign fleeting life had been submissive when facing the human King, but now he was facing Li Hao, who was at the seventh step, with a heavy punch!They bullied the weak and feared the strong!He wasn't afraid of an eighth-rank cultivator fighting a seventh-rank cultivator. Even if Li Hao had killed di yang before, he knew that he had only been killed by Li Hao last time because many powerhouses had joined forces and confined di yang.It didn't mean that Li Hao really had the power to kill an eighth step cultivator!Li Hao, who was at the sixth step, could kill a cultivator at the seventh step.However, Li Hao, who was at the seventh step, could not kill a cultivator at the eighth step, because the improvement at the seventh step was too little for Li Hao. The key to him was the number of realms and the number of great DAOs, not the strength of a Dao.As a result, even though his combat strength was stronger than before, it was still not as much as the increase at the sixth rank.At this moment, Li Hao could be considered a top-tier level Seven.However, in terms of strength, he was still inferior to a level Seven human King. A level Seven human King could rival a level eight human King, while Li Hao was slightly weaker.As soon as Fu Sheng made his move, and with the interference of some spirits around him, Li Hao staggered and took a few steps back despite the power of a thousand worlds in one sword. On the other hand, although there were some bloody marks on venerable Emperor Fu Sheng's fist, he smiled.In fact, he had been a little worried just now, but he had still gained the upper hand in the fight with Li Hao. Now ... He was confident. The confidence he had lost from the human King would have to be regained from the Silver Moon King."Shi Guang?"Fu Sheng sneered."It looks like he's not that great!"He had learned about Li Hao's situation from Samsara. Perhaps Li Hao specialized in time, but from the looks of it, he wasn't that good, even though this was the first time they had fought.Li Hao didn't say anything.He drew his sword!The Tribulation lightning appeared, the primal Chaos tribulation lightning!The sword of calamity.Fu Sheng was a little shaken and quickly punched out. Life and death appeared. His punch hit the lightning and his body went numb. The next moment, he felt a little more at ease and secretly exhaled. Even a rank eight like him was a little afraid of the chaos lightning tribulation.However, he soon discovered that it wasn't as powerful as the true Primal Chaos lightning tribulation. It was only at the seventh-rank, and he was instantly relieved.He had many tricks up his sleeve!Unfortunately, I'm at the eighth step!At this moment, Li Hao was only using his sword. Although he might not be able to match this guy, he was not too afraid. At this moment, the more troublesome thing was how to solve the crisis in front of him. A Fu Sheng was nothing.However, the problem with the human King ... Was really difficult to solve.At this moment, four rank eights were attacking him. Samsara and that rank eight chaos expert were both experts and were not easy to deal with. Li Hao did not have the ability to deal with them.From the looks of it now, they should wait for the neo martial artists to come to help.Should I ... Shi Guang?At this current stage, the only one who could break out of this was Shi Guang.However, how could he use time to break out of this situation?Or ... Should he wait a little longer? currently, the opportunity was not suitable. What he was afraid of was that before that happened, the human King would die.At this moment, Li Hao was also in a dilemma.In fact, there was still hope for him to use time at full force once and reverse the human King to his peak state, which was before he was severely injured. In this way, the human King would have a chance to start turning the tables ... But from the looks of it, even if he were to recover to his peak state, it would be difficult to break out of this situation.Moreover, the timing had to be right. If he went all out, he could reverse the situation once. However, if Li Hao wanted to reverse the situation a second time for an expert like the human King, he would probably have to sacrifice all his lifespan.BOOM!Just as he was thinking about this, a loud noise was heard. Li Hao clattered, and a large hole appeared on his sword. Li Hao's expression changed slightly, and he felt a headache.Even though the firmament sword had reached the peak of the sixth rank, it still could not withstand his power. Moreover, it was dealing with an eighth rank venerable sovereign, so it was on the verge of exploding.Having a weapon was better than not having one, but the quality of the weapon was not good.Every time he went all out, it was very easy for it to be completely shattered ... This made Li Hao feel somewhat helpless. The quality of this sword was too poor. It was already so bad when he was still at the seventh level. Now that it was at the eighth or ninth level ... It was obviously useless.

Chapter 3432 Cooperation (3)
And the current situation was extremely unfavorable to them!Wait?Had neo martial sensed the situation yet? if they waited, would an opportunity appear?From the corner of his eyes, he looked at the other places. Although it was a little difficult for Silver Moon Emperor to deal with the spirit, with the cooperation of second cat and the others, there were seventh-rank experts. They could still deal with it. The three eighth-rank experts might not be able to defeat the three newcomers, but they could hold on for a while.The most troublesome was still the human King.Secondly ... On his side, an eighth rank venerable sovereign and two seventh rank specters were surrounding him. His situation didn't seem to be good.Could neo martial ... Create opportunities for his side?Were the Supremes here to assist or to attack the world of reincarnation?Also ... Can we take it down?Samsara was going all out, four rank eights were sent out. Did they not think that the world would be broken?The thought emerged once again.At this moment, Li Hao could only suppress the palpitations in his heart and decide to wait a little longer. As long as the human King was not dead and still had a breath left, he could reverse the situation once. At this moment, even if he was severely injured and his bones were almost broken ... He couldn't care less! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  It was fine as long as he still had a breath left!The human King should like this kind of excitement.……Outside the reincarnation realm.The Paragon and the others arrived. However, at this moment, Emperor Cang felt a little uneasy. He looked into the distance and saw that the calm and indifferent Emperor Cang was starting to get anxious,""Meow Meow ... Sinister Zhang ... Something doesn't seem right ..."Zhi Zun didn't mind the way Emperor Cang addressed him. This cat had always liked to give people nicknames. It was often like this, saying whatever it thought.At this moment, he didn't care about hiding anything.The martial King looked into the distance, but he couldn't see anything. The Samsara Emperor had concealed the battlefield, so he could only be sensed nearby. However, the human King had been with them for many years and had controlled yin and yang for many years. At this moment, the Supreme-being actually felt that something was wrong.Perhaps ... The situation was more serious than he had expected.He might have trusted Fang ping too much.However ... He still maintained his calm. Although there might have been a little accident, it was not the moment of certain death. He was very clear that if it really came to that time, he would know.Suppressing the uneasiness in his heart, he looked at the world of reincarnation. In the inner realm, even if there were no rank eights, there were still many rank Sevens. In the reincarnation realm, there were a total of 14 rank Sevens. Of course, four of them were killed last time.The Autarch still didn't know that the other four had actually been resurrected.There were 14 rank seven venerable sovereigns in the reincarnation realm! It was not just one or two, but 14 seventh level venerable sovereigns. They were in charge of a top-notch eighth level great world. They were all local venerable sovereigns and were extremely powerful in their territory.Although he didn't know the exact number, the Paragon's expression was still rather serious.He turned around and looked at his side. There were quite a few grade-7 experts here.The divine light plane still had four rank Sevens: blood Emperor, Sword Master, Lizhu, Earth King, and sun god. That was nine rank Sevens. In fact, there were new rank Sevens that the dragon clan had given to the three major worlds.The human King had only absorbed the light, not the three worlds.And these three worlds had created two rank seven venerable sovereigns.The world of the demon race was more suitable for the demon race. One of them was the heavenly dog, and the other Level Seven was Qin Fengqing. This fellow was not a demon, but he was too proactive. Before anyone had even asked, he had already started to ask for it. He did not even care about his face. The others were not as shameless as him, so they could only wait.11 rank 7s, along with light, himself, and Cang Mao, 3 rank 8s.With such strength, even if there were many powerhouses in the world of Samsara, Zhi Zun was not afraid of anything. Moreover, if they really fought, perhaps he could lure out the two tier 7 iron-eating powerhouses who were wandering nearby. He knew that the two of them were looking for new martial artists and silver Moon.However, he had never shown himself.The Grandmaster looked at the world of reincarnation in front of him. It was incomparably huge. At this moment, there were many venerable sovereigns standing guard near the realm gate. He glanced at the crowd and the light and said,"Attack! Attack!"The radiance Thearch was surprised. Attack?He had thought that this new martial Supreme had other thoughts.As for the Supreme martial artist, he didn't say much.He looked around ... Without saying a word, the next moment, one figure after another flashed like lightning with shocking speed. The fastest was a big bald man, who also held a big saber and laughed strangely as he charged straight for Samsara!The Grandmaster was not surprised. Although Qin Fengqing was shameless, he was really brutal when he fought."Enemy attack!"In the distance, a loud shout came from the reincarnation realm. In the next moment, rank seven auras emerged. A large number of venerable sovereigns in the realm seemed to have been prepared for this. Today was not the same as before. They were completely unprepared.Today, the world of reincarnation seemed to have made its preparations. With a loud shout, hundreds of venerable sovereigns appeared and gathered their great DAOs. With so many people, even though the venerable sovereigns were not strong, they quickly set off a wave!The universe of the great path of reincarnation was directly presented in the sky above the reincarnation realm.The seventh rank venerable sovereigns quickly walked out of the realm gate. Their auras instantly boiled. The leader of the seventh rank venerable sovereigns, a peak venerable sovereign, shouted,""Neo martial? Dao master is right, you rats like to do this kind of thing!"Obviously, the reincarnation Emperor had also judged whether the other party would come to attack their homeland.He was prepared.14 seventh level venerable sovereigns and more than 100 middle and low level venerable sovereigns were guarding the territory. Their combat strength was still extremely strong.

Chapter 3433 Cooperation (Part 4)
As for the Supreme martial artist, his expression changed slightly as he glanced over.The few rank-7s that were killed by the human King last time ... Had been resurrected.Although some people did not care about the rank-7s at all, he had always remembered them. As soon as he saw these people appear in the other side's camp, he immediately realized that there was a bit of trouble.This meant that the three rank-8s might have been resurrected, and Fang ping would have to face the siege of at least four rank-8s.At least!The Samsara realm probably didn't have enough resources to revive so many experts. In other words, the Overlord of Samsara might have joined one of the three overlords. Who could afford to revive three rank eights and four rank Sevens?Huntian!Would the other party also send a rank eight venerable sovereign?It should be. To transport resources, at least one powerful venerable sovereign was needed to transport them. That could be five level eight venerable sovereigns!No wonder!The Supreme martial artist suddenly understood. No wonder he was a little uneasy this time. There were at least five rank-8s and a powerhouse like Samsara. Fang ping was indeed in big trouble.But now ... It was not to the point of certain death.In that case, it was possible that ... Someone had made a move?Who was it?Li Hao?It was possible.They were not in the Thunder World. They might have left the Thunder World, or they might have met Fang ping ...Various thoughts quickly emerged in Zhi Zun's mind. However, if Li Hao and the others also made a move, Li Hao and the others would be comparable to a rank-eight since the Wushan Thunder Emperor was at rank-eight, and they had taken Gemini away last time, so there was a high chance that their Dao chess would also reach rank-eight ...Logically speaking, he shouldn't be feeling uneasy.From the looks of it, there was still an accident!" 12 of the 16 Level-8 worlds in the East have joined forces. Eight of them have left for the square region, while the other eight are still in charge of the great worlds ... Gemini has been destroyed, and reincarnation is still here. There are still two Level-8 worlds that have yet to show themselves ..."The Grandmaster's heart trembled slightly. Could it be that ... There were two other clans that had participated in the battle?Thousands of thoughts ran through his mind.Looking at the Samsara realm again, there were 14 rank-7s. There were a lot of them, more than a hundred middle to low venerable sovereigns. However, they still could not stop neo martial. However, it would not be easy for neo martial to take down Samsara. The other party was overseeing the local area ... Moreover, since they knew that neo martial might attack, would Samsara still have other means if they dared to ambush Fang ping?BOOM!In front of them, a great battle had already begun.The battle instantly erupted!All the tier 7 neo martial artists joined the battle. There were also a large number of venerable sovereigns below tier 7 who rushed forward quickly. In an instant, the sound of fighting shook the sky!A group of extremely brutal neo martial artists went straight for Samsara. However, the other side had the advantage of being in their own territory. At this moment, they were still impregnable. They didn't attack alone, but defended together!Yes, defense.At this time, the light Thearch also looked at the Supreme. Tier seven neo martial artists were not enough. The other side had 14 tier seven neo martial artists. Although the tier seven neo martial artists were strong, most of them were newly advanced venerable sovereigns. Under such circumstances, it would be difficult to break through. "Fellow Daoist Zhang ... Should we attack together?"At this moment, Emperor Cang couldn't hold himself back and was prepared to launch a surprise attack. The Paragon looked at the light Emperor, then at Emperor Cang, and finally at the world of reincarnation. His eyes flickered,""Fellow Daoist Guang Ming, please stay here. I'll leave the lives of hundreds of new martial arts 'venerable sovereigns in your hands!"Light Emperor was stunned. What did he mean?"In addition, I would like to ask the venerable sovereigns in the world of light ... Low and mid-stage venerable sovereigns to help me. Don't participate in the battle of reincarnation and leave with me ...""You guys are going to the human King's side?"Light Thearch reacted.I'm here to pester you, are you going to save him?It was not impossible.Of course, if they left, the chances of beating Samsara would be very small.The Grandmaster didn't say much. He glanced at the world of reincarnation and continued,"Also, it might not be ... Only 14 tier 7!" "What?"The light Thearch's heart moved slightly. Could it be that there was more?There's still a seventh rank?The Grandmaster made a quick assessment. He determined that there might be rank Sevens within Samsara, but they weren't local. They were outsiders who hadn't appeared yet. There might even be rank eights ... Of course, rank eights might not be here.However, there were definitely more tier 7 ones.It was definitely more than this.Perhaps, there were still quite a few.Although fourteen rank Sevens were a lot, they could not stop several rank eights from the neo martial artists. If the Samsara Emperor was really ready, then there were at least five rank Sevens left to guard the inner circle. At the critical moment, they might give the neo martial artists a thunderous blow!"Daoist Guangming, be careful. Don't join the battle for the time being ... Just stand guard! I'll leave a clone behind to confuse the enemy ... The three of us won't participate in the battle for the time being. No matter how many hidden experts there are, we won't easily reveal ourselves!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared. A Supreme venerable that looked exactly the same as the radiance Supreme Emperor was left behind. Not only that, but Emperor Cang also left behind a clone and left with him.Light Thearch's heart moved slightly. He was a little shocked.He ... Really left?"If you leave, he's an outsider. At this moment, more than a hundred venerable sovereigns from neo martial arts are fighting with the enemy. If something happens, it'll be a big problem.More importantly, this person had asked him not to participate in the battle.He was a little shocked. Once something happened, neo martial might be completely annihilated. These people were too bold.He was a rank eight venerable sovereign, a veteran Overlord. At this moment, even though he was shocked, he suppressed all his emotions and looked at the Samsara realm and the battlefield expressionlessly. His voice resounded,""Go all out and kill them. We will wait for Samsara to return and kill Samsara!" Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  "Kill!"The sounds of battle shook the heavens!At this moment, the group of people in the reincarnation realm were silent. They looked up at the sky and did not go out nor join in the battle. They were just waiting. The leader frowned and said,"Three rank 8s, and not a single one of them is participating! If they don't move, we can't move! From the looks of it, Samsara still has a certain advantage ... It's good to drag this out!"

Chapter 3434 Cooperation (Part 5)
There were many experts here, all of whom had Grade 7 strength. At a glance, there were more than ten of them.Some of these people came from Grade 7 worlds and were sector Lord and Dao Lord level experts that huntian had recruited.Some people came from the other two rank eight worlds. One of the rank eight worlds had at least three or four rank seven venerable sovereigns, and it was normal for it to have seven or eight at most.Samsara had only taken rank eight venerable sovereigns with them, but there were many rank seven venerable sovereigns gathered here!One or two of them could not fight against a level eight venerable sovereign, but once there were more of them, including the 14 outside, more than 20 Level Seven venerable sovereigns could fight against the new martial artists. If the other party was careless and was ambushed, they might even be defeated!The seventh level venerable sovereigns who stayed behind all nodded. Someone laughed and said,""It's better if they don't make a move! Otherwise ... He would still be a little nervous when dealing with a tier 8! Since they are waiting for the return of the reincarnation Emperor ... Let them wait!""We only have one mission, which is to protect Samsara. Once Samsara's venerable sovereigns are defeated, we'll take action. It's best if we can kill a few tier seven neo martial artists in one Swift blow ..."Everyone nodded in agreement.After all, this wasn't their home world. Even though they were working with Samsara, or rather, everyone had joined huntian, it was still very dangerous to fight against this group of high-level venerable sovereigns who didn't fear death.It would naturally be best if he didn't have to make a move.……"Where to? "Fang Ping's not here ..."At that moment, Emperor Cang was panicking.It had sensed it.Not here.The Grandmaster was expressionless. He looked forward and said in a deep voice,""If we don't go to Fang Ping's place, distant water can't quench present thirst ... It's still far away. There should be two more major worlds nearby, which are definitely not far from reincarnation. There's only hope of saving them if we destroy these two level 8 worlds ... Hurry up, big cat, your nose is sharper than a heavenly dog 's. Hurry up!"Samsara wasn't an easy opponent!Perhaps Fang ping would be dead by the time they defeated Samsara.Even if they gave it their all, it would still take time to kill more than a dozen or even more rank seven venerable sovereigns. At this moment, they could only take a gamble, or, according to their own judgment, if no other rank eight venerable sovereigns made a move, Fang ping would not be in absolute danger.If there was ... It must be the two level 8 worlds that did not participate in the battle.The chances of them coming from other domains weren't very high. The overlords wouldn't allow their own class eights to leave so easily. This meant that ... As long as they could take down these two worlds, there was a chance of resolving the crisis. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  The premise was that they had to be broken at the same time!"Big cat, these two worlds must be nearby. They can't be too far away from reincarnation. Even the rank eight and rank Seven Worlds have left. You and I can each take one ...""A human and a cat!"Big cat corrected.The Grandmaster was speechless. 'Motherf * cker, you still care about this at this time?' "Cut the crap! "Remember, once we find it, you and I ... A human and a cat, you have to destroy an eighth-rank world, and so do I. We have to be fast and destroy their damn universe at the same time. Only then can we break the eighth-rank universe of both sides and create an opportunity ..."The Grandmaster quickly made arrangements, his face cold. "It's not the time for certain death yet. Fang ping isn't that weak yet, and he hasn't used his ultimate skill ... That means there's still a chance!"Then, he looked at the big cat and frowned.""Can you quickly destroy an eighth-tier universe?"Cang Mao looked at him sideways, his huge head facing him. He looked at him and didn't say a word. Who are you looking down on?You've just entered level eight, how dare you talk to a cat that entered level eight three days earlier than you?"What are you looking at? hurry up and find it!"Grandmaster smacked its head. What are you looking at? why is your cat nose so bad?Cang Mao was depressed and did not say a word, but his nose twitched.Its nose was quite sharp.If the distance was far, it might not be easy to tell, but the martial King said that it was nearby ... Although the blue cat didn't know how he determined that it was nearby, the martial King usually wouldn't make a mistake. This guy was too smart.Cat's nose twitched, and soon, his eyes showed some joy.""Over there ... There are fluctuations of the great Dao universe, but ... Are you sure it's ...""Shut up!"Zhi Zun quickly interrupted it. Nonsense, it definitely was.This was the nine Heavens!p It was not the eighth heaven.Ordinary Level eight worlds would not dare to come up. Only a few, such as reincarnation and Extreme Ice, were in the ninth heaven. There were other great Dao universe fluctuations here, which was clearly the world he was looking for.As for why they were so sure that the two worlds would definitely be near the reincarnation cycle if they were to participate in the war. Otherwise, once the rank 8 world left and was discovered, who would let go of the opportunity to devour the rank 8 world?On the other hand, the more dangerous it was, the safer it was to stay near reincarnation!Everyone was staring at Samsara. Who would care about the nearby areas?It was just a basic operation!The experts of the outer domain had lived for so long that they weren't completely brainless. The Autarchs felt that it was normal for them to hide here.Hiding here meant that his judgment was correct. The two eighth-rank worlds had really participated in the war. According to his understanding, one of the two families had two eighth-rank venerable sovereigns!One of them was relatively strong. It seemed to be called the sun Moon Jie and had two level eight venerable sovereigns. The other one only had one level eight venerable sovereigns and was called the shattered Earth Jie."Big cat, you're going to deal with sun and moon?"The old cat was still tracking the direction. When it heard this, it turned to look at the martial king again, its eyes filled with disbelief. You want a cat to deal with a powerful tier 8 world?

Chapter 3435 Cooperation (1)_6
"All the rank-8s should have left. If I'm not wrong, even all the rank-7s have left, or maybe more than half of them have left ... It's not too dangerous."That won't do either!"No!" Bigcat shook its head."You deal with sun and moon. I'll ... Deal with the other one!"Do you think I'm stupid?The Grandmaster laughed,"up to you. Hurry up. You're too slow!" It looks like you're not confident in your own strength ..."Goading the cat?The old cat didn't say a word. It didn't care. It wasn't a human. It was shameless. It was useless to provoke it.The human and cat were extremely fast.Under the lead of the Supreme martial artist, they shuttled through the void. There were faint signs of space teleportation. The speed was unbelievably fast. Soon, two worlds appeared in front of them. They were actually together and not too far away from the world of reincarnation.As expected!When the Autarch saw these two worlds, he actually let out a sigh of relief!I was right.It was just that ... Did that mean that Fang ping and the others might have encountered a total of eight eighth-rank venerable sovereigns, or even ... More?Who knew if the other Overlord would send one or more level 8 experts ...There were at least eight rank-8s, and they had not been killed yet. Fang ping was really tough.Even at this moment, he still maintained his composure and did not panic."Li Hao should be over there ... Fang ping is not stupid. If there were eight of them, he would have run away a long time ago. There might not have been eight rank-8s at the beginning. If they appeared later, that means ... The ones who came later are most likely the three rank-8 venerable sovereigns from these two worlds. They should have been prepared to ambush us, but their opponents now ... Are probably Wu Shan and the others!"The Grandmaster quickly said.Cang Mao was prepared to charge out, but he quickly stopped. He looked at him anxiously,"are you still not going to attack?""No rush!"Zhi Zun was extremely calm."There's no hurry. If the opponents of these three are Wu Shan and the others, they might not be weak, but they've just advanced. They might not be able to seize the opportunity to deal with these three eighth-rank powerhouses. They might not be able to seize the opportunity to quickly kill them! "Then we'd have missed the best opportunity. We have telepathy with Fang ping, but that doesn't mean we have the same reaction with these few people ...""If that's the case, then I'll have wasted my efforts!"At this point, he thought of something."Li Hao ... Li Hao is a smart man. We must tell Li Hao that he has cooperated with new martial arts. If he knows about it, he will definitely be able to seize the opportunity. As long as we can kill these three venerable sovereigns ... We will have a chance!"The grey cat was speechless. It was so far.How was he supposed to inform them now?Do you have a clone over there?The Grandmaster sighed."Don't look at me. I really don't have a clone over there. Silver Moon and his men are prideful to the core, and tailing them will definitely cause dissatisfaction. Since that's the case ... Then ... I'll have to ... Make my grandson suffer!"What did that mean?Before Cang Mao could understand, Zhi Zun suddenly extracted a drop of essence blood from his own body. He sighed,"My poor grandson, you'll act as a Messenger. I hope Li Hao can understand what I mean ... Seize this opportunity!" As soon as he finished speaking, he ignited his blood essence.A figure seemed to appear, and it looked like ... Zhang an!They were connected by the same vein!The Grandmaster sighed. It's been hard on you, my grandson. It's a little painful, but ... At this time, the chaos is too big, and it's not easy to communicate. This is the only way.……At the same time.Li Hao had been waiting for an opportunity. On the other side, the Samsara Emperor chuckled."I thought they would come. It seems that they trust the human King and chose to attack Samsara!"As a sector Lord, he naturally sensed the situation.Neo martial had gone to Samsara.It was good news!Not bad.Perhaps, this time, they could be completely wiped out."Then they won't be able to come here. The land of reincarnation is quite far from here. It will take them some time ..." He thought.The reincarnation Emperor laughed.Neo martial's whereabouts had been revealed.Then there would be no more obstacles in this place.In the world of Samsara, there were more than 14 rank 7s, 24 in total!There were 14 more than expected, because there were still four people who had resurrected. With so many new martial artists ... If they really surrounded Samsara, they would probably be pleasantly surprised to find that they couldn't beat them!At this moment, many of the human King's bone armor was broken, and blood was dripping from his golden bone armor. He wasn't even breathing, and his mouth was opening and closing. Even though he was severely injured, he still sneered,""Be careful not to go for wool and come home shorn. Old Zhang and the others are here to destroy Samsara's home ground. Let's see what you can do!""Then I'm looking forward to that!"The reincarnation Emperor laughed. Could it be broken?If it could really destroy 24 seventh level venerable sovereigns so easily, then new martial would have long been an Overlord of the chaos.The power of life and death pressed down again. With a loud boom, the human King bone armor broke a little more. The Samsara Emperor sighed."The life force of a human King is really tenacious. No wonder he could survive until now ..."This guy was too hard to kill!If it wasn't for the fact that they had planned it out perfectly, with so many experts working together and two to three grade 8 experts alone, they really wouldn't be able to do anything to him. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  No wonder this person was so arrogant!For an inner world to transform into a Dao domain with an endless stream of power was still extremely terrifying.At this moment, a person among the Silver Moon Emperor's group suddenly screamed as if he had been hit by a ghost. His blood began to burn and boil, and his scream made Li Hao, who was struggling to face it, look at him.

Chapter 3436 Cooperation (Part 7)
Who was screaming so miserably?He looked out of the corner of his eye. Hmm, Zhang an?How could this be? in his eyes, even though Zhang an's strength was average, he was a competitive person. Even if he was injured, he would not be screaming so miserably. When he looked at Zhang an, his blood began to burn ...Blood ignition?This ... Wasn't the state of being struck by a spirit. His blood suddenly started burning ... A bloodline of the same origin?Supreme martial artist?This was the work of a Supreme neo martial artist. He seemed to want to tell Li Hao something through this method. Logically speaking, there was no need for him to communicate with him ...However, at this moment, Zhang an suddenly self-immolated, so there must be some important information that the other party wanted to tell him.What did the Grandmaster want to say?He looked out of the corner of his eye and saw that he had taken Fu Sheng's palm and was sent flying, but he was still looking in that direction. Fu Sheng and the others didn't care about a third level venerable sovereign, but Li Hao was extremely concerned.The Supreme martial artist and the others seemed to be attacking Samsara, but at this moment, they were sending him a private message ...At this moment, Zhang an was screaming in pain. The blood in his body was burning bit by bit. He knew that it was his grandfather's doing and he almost wanted to curse out loud!What was the old man doing?Are you trying to burn me to death?As for Li Hao, when he took a closer look, he saw that Zhang an seemed to have been burnt to the point of being torn apart. His face was covered in dirt, as if ... He had been deliberately burned to this state.As he thought about it, he thought of a few things. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  "Crack the earth!" He suddenly shouted.There seemed to be a realm among the level 8 great worlds called the earth-splitting realm!But Li Hao didn't recognize him.There were three rank eights here, and one of them was Thearch earth-shattering?As soon as he finished speaking, the venerable sovereign who was fighting with Wu Shan in the distance suddenly turned his head and sneered.""You recognize me? It seems that the Silver Moon King has some understanding of our Eastern Region. So what if you recognize me?"He was not afraid of anything!Today, these people were all going to die!So what if he recognized her?Li Hao was just testing the waters, so he wasn't too sure. The Supreme-being's hint was a little vague.However, at this moment, he was certain!Earth-splitting!'A Supreme neo martial ... Is going to attack the shattered Earth world, and even another eighth-rank world. This must be the case!'Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he was delighted.The opportunity he had been waiting for had arrived.At this moment, he suddenly felt a little emotional and sighed. He then looked at the human King ... At this moment, the human King seemed to have guessed something. He let out a pained grunt and looked at Li Hao. The eye in the Golden skeleton looked at Li Hao.He seemed to be smiling!It was as if he was saying,"kid, isn't my new martial very powerful?"As for Li Hao, at this moment, he was really envious. The Supreme of neo martial arts ... Actually ... Actually guessed it. Or did he already know the situation?His opponent was not in reincarnation. He had gone to the shattered Earth world!Looking at Yuan Shuo, who was still fighting in the crowd, Li Hao suddenly roared,""Teacher, when did you enter the seventh rank?"“……”Yuan Shuo, who was in the middle of killing the spirits, was stunned for a moment. Damn it, how could it be so fast!At this moment, he was already surrounded by countless spirits and was fighting with all his might. When he heard this, he was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood. 'I also want to reach Level Seven as soon as possible, but ... It's not like I can reach Level Seven just because I want to.'Now, he had entered the 4th tier, which was already very fast!This bastard, he was about to be beaten to death, and now he still wanted to provoke me?Venerable monarch fleeting life also laughed."Teacher? Your teacher is only a fourth stage venerable sovereign ... Hahaha ... This is ridiculous. You can't be expecting this fourth stage weakling to save you, can you?"Yuan Shuo's face was ashen. He didn't say a word as he unleashed his five birds technique, killing all the spirits in the surroundings. He gritted his teeth and was extremely furious.F * ck, it was fine if his own disciple ridiculed him.Even an outsider, an enemy, was actually mocking him. So what if he was at the 4th rank?Was Tier 4 very weak?How old am I? How long had he been a venerable sovereign?I'm so unhappy!At this moment, Li Hao laughed heartily."My teacher has a Dao domain. A level Seven Dao domain is just around the corner. When the five elements are combined, once he reaches Level Seven, he'll definitely be able to quickly reach level eight ..."Venerable sovereign fleeting life sneered. Suddenly, he turned around and sent a palm toward Yuan Shuo! Then, I'll destroy your hopes.What was she thinking?Your teacher is so weak. If I kill him, you'll lose your composure, right?That's not bad!As for Li Hao, he also laughed."As expected, I knew that this Fu Sheng would attack teacher. Calm down for a moment. Teacher ... Don't be killed by a single slap!"Yuan Shuo's expression changed drastically.艹!This stupid disciple of mine is good at scamming his master. If you call me out at this time and flatter me, they'll kill me even if they don 't!You're such a scammer!What are you doing, kid?He roared and his five-element Dao domain appeared. Sword Qi exploded and he returned a punch. His combat power was very strong, but Fu Sheng just sneered.Not bad, there really was a Dao domain. No wonder the Silver Moon King was so confident that his master could reach the seventh rank.Unfortunately ... He didn't have the chance!Killing a genius was a very satisfying thing.He increased his strength and once again struck at Yuan Shuo. Li Hao, who was beside him, disappeared in an instant. Fu Sheng was not worried at all. Where can you escape to?I only need an instant to kill your master!At this moment, the time star above Li Hao's head shot toward the three level 8s. His voice resounded in all directions."Kill them!"Everyone thought it was a joke ... The three level eight venerable sovereigns sneered.What can you do even if you come?As a Grade 7, you'll only be courting death if you join the battle!This guy was tired of living!……At the same time.The Paragon suddenly disappeared and reappeared in the sky above a realm. Thousands of figures appeared, and a book of the great Dao covered the sky. At this moment, nothing else mattered. The book of the great Dao suppressed the world. Countless cultivators in the realm looked up and were suppressed to death by the power of the great Dao!In the entire rank eight world, there was only one rank seven venerable sovereign. In an instant, a fist appeared in front of him!One punch!A thousand incarnations as one, the book of the bed came crashing down. With a boom, he punched out, and the other party was instantly destroyed. With disbelief ... Who was it?An enemy attack!However, it was too late. In just a moment, the Supreme-being disappeared. With a fierce roar, he punched out instantly, overturning the entire world. The world origin appeared, but it was instantly destroyed by his punch!The great Dao universe appeared. He roared and tore the void apart, directly tearing a crack in the great Dao universe!The sun and moon appeared!This was the world of the sun and moon.The Supreme-being transformed into a giant and punched the great Dao universe. The book instantly burrowed into the universe, and in the blink of an eye, the power of the great Dao emerged. It was as if thousands of Giants were worshiping it, and the stars exploded instantly!Not far away, Emperor Cang's fishing rod was swung and a rank seven venerable sovereign was caught. He opened his mouth and devoured the heavens and earth, causing the entire rank eight world to collapse!Emperor Cang opened his mouth wide and bit down. With a crack, the invisible and shapeless great Dao universe actually appeared. At that moment, a huge crack was bitten out!The power of countless great DAOs overflowed, and the two eighth-tier universes were instantly destroyed by the man and the cat.And the two universes only had one level Seven in each.They were all killed instantly!A terrifying fluctuation instantly spread out, and the two great Dao universes began to collapse. As for the Supreme, he let out a breath and looked into the distance with some worry.If he didn't understand ... He might miss this opportunity!Little Li Hao, you're very smart. Do you understand what I mean?

Chapter 3437 Di Shi (3)_1
Do you understand?He had roughly guessed it, but who cared if it was true or not!At this moment, Li Hao made his move. His longsword cut through the air and was almost completely shattered.Time and Stars floated, heaven and earth changed colors, and time and space seemed to be frozen."Second cat, lonely ..."His roar shook the heavens and earth!Was it the right time?He did not know.If the timing and judgment were wrong, he might have to pay a huge price. However, Li Hao didn't care anymore. He believed that his judgment was correct. What harm was there in taking a gamble?At the same time, the reincarnation Emperor frowned.Suddenly, his expression changed. In the next moment, his aura rose to the peak and he shouted,""Kill the human King!"The two rank eight Samsara venerable sovereigns and the chaos race's rank eight venerable sovereign all focused when they heard this. They had been grinding and preparing to exhaust the human King to death. They didn't need to take any risks or pay any great price.However, at this moment, the reincarnation Emperor suddenly went crazy. He had obviously noticed something wrong.The few of them did not dare to delay and quickly erupted!In an instant, the human King felt that he was in danger and was about to fall ...At this moment, the human King's bone armor glowed with golden light as he exhaled.A bet?Of course!"Are you playing hard?"The human King roared, and in an instant, the sky changed color. The human King roared, and flesh and blood suddenly grew on his body. He roared,""Yin and yang reverse my body!"The world was overturned, and time and space were reversed.The human King's flesh and blood instantly regenerated, and his extremely weak aura began to recover in an instant. However, the Yang Qi in his body was instantly depleted, making him look like a dead person. At this moment, he seemed to have turned into a ghost from the netherworld.Yin Yang reversal!The dead could be resurrected!Reincarnation palm of life and death, yin and yang reversing the universe.The human king who had left neo martial seemed to have been forgotten by everyone. It was as if everyone had forgotten that he had reversed yin and yang in the past and resurrected many people.At this moment, Primal Chaos tribulation lightning suddenly appeared in the world.Level 8!In fact, it was even rapidly expanding toward the peak of the eighth-rank, the lightning tribulation of destruction without order!Reversing yin and yang, throwing life and death into disorder, using time ... These were all the targets of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.This was the trump card of the human King.Self-destruction and self-destruction of flesh and blood were all a piece of cake.Li Hao thought of reviving the human King, but there was actually no need. As the leader of neo martial arts, the human King had led neo martial arts for a short thousand years and made it to this day. How could he not have some trump cards?At this moment, the aura of a human King rapidly recovered to its peak.Of course, the price was not small.There was a price to pay for any heaven-defying action. His body expanded like a dead man, and Yin Qi emerged, covering the sky and earth. He laughed loudly, ignoring the thunder and lightning in the sky. He laughed arrogantly,"Reincarnation, I also want to see if you can reverse life and death after I kill you. Otherwise, are you worthy of being called reincarnation?" A punch!BOOM!The sudden recovery was beyond everyone's expectations. Even the reincarnation Emperor was shocked!Did everyone know that the human King can reverse yin and yang?He knew.However, that was a long time ago in neo martial. Moreover, he had left the neo martial world and the neo Martial Universe. Some people even suspected that he no longer had the ability to reverse yin and yang, life and death.Even if he could ... Could he reverse his situation?No one knew.Today, everyone knew that it was possible.The human King reversed his yin and yang, instantly returning to his peak. His combat strength reached its peak in the blink of an eye. The lightning tribulation appeared in the sky and shot straight at the human King. In the next moment, the human King chuckled. Suddenly, an inner world appeared, as if it contained the entire void!It instantly covered the few people around.Sky-stealing sun-changing!The sun changing technique.Li Jing knew how to do it, so how could he not?If he didn't know how to do it, then he wouldn't be the master of the new martial arts in vain. In an instant, the expression of the Samsara Emperor changed!Damn it!The level 8 lightning tribulation was close to the peak of level 8 and had the power of more than 5000 Dao laws. In an instant, countless lightning bolts appeared and turned into Giants that charged at the level 8 experts.The human King laughed heartily!"Is it exciting?""Samsara, you've resurrected a few rank eights, so you're also a target of divine retribution. No matter what method you used to avoid the primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... Right now, you're going to undergo the Tribulation with me!",m The reincarnation sovereign had used some unknown method to hide his aura and avoid the lightning tribulation in order to not let anyone find out that he had resurrected several powerful cultivators. However, at this moment, the human King had reversed his situation and pushed him to the peak. In an instant, the lightning tribulation had descended!The reincarnation Emperor's face turned ugly.'Damn it!'No matter how much he calculated, he did not expect that the human King could reverse yin and yang. He thought that he could not even control yin and yang without neo martial. Even if he could, it would only be a simple realization, not a reversal of his eighth-rank power! Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  At this instant, the several grade 8 experts all faced the power of God tribulation lightning.This was the confidence of a human King.He didn't know the Dao of life and death, nor the Dao of time, so what?Don't forget, he had resurrected countless people in the early years. It was just a small trick. The new martial artists were not afraid of death. They all believed that even if they died, the human King would pay a great price to resurrect them.At worst, they would turn into nether soldiers!So what?Without Yang Qi, he would kill and snatch again!The change at this moment not only shocked the Samsara Emperor and the others, but also Li Hao. He had wanted to find an opportunity to reverse time for the human King and restore him to his peak.In the end, he didn't even need to do anything.The human King reversed yin and yang on his own and actually recovered to his peak. Even Li Hao did not expect this. He thought that perhaps only time could have such an effect, or perhaps the Dao of resurrection from destruction ...

Chapter 3438 Di Shi (2)
As it turned out, they had underestimated the human King.It was a good thing!At this moment, Li Hao also laughed. Since the human King could recover to his peak state, what was there to hesitate about?He had only used a little bit of the power of time, and what was left was more of hope for the revival of the human Emperor. But now, the other party had awakened on his own ... What was there to worry about?In an instant, time burst out with an incomparably resplendent brilliance!At this moment, the power of lightning appeared above his head, the primal Chaos tribulation lightning.The three grade 8s still didn't understand.However, when the light of time appeared and spread in all directions, their bodies became slightly sluggish, and the power of their great DAOs became somewhat sluggish. The three of them still had a slight change in expression, but soon, they were not too afraid.They wanted to stop three level 8s?That was impossible!Li Hao had overestimated himself and underestimated the strength of the three level 8 powerhouses.Thearch earthsplitter's punch was so powerful that it was as if the mountains were collapsing and the earth was splitting apart. Even the chaos was collapsing. He snorted coldly and forced Wu Shan back with his punch. The earth-elemental power on his body erupted and shattered the power of time!I am a rank eight venerable sovereign!Or is it a realm Lord or Dao Lord? how can you freeze me in a mere moment of time?,m Reality proved that it was indeed impossible. It was too difficult. The power of time was not strong enough. It could deal with Level 7s, but against three level 8s, in the blink of an eye, the three of them were on the verge of shattering time.However, at this moment, all three of them suddenly changed their expressions!Not good!As soon as such a thought emerged in his mind, earth-shattering Supreme Emperor's expression changed drastically and he roared,""Damn it!"BOOM!The power of a great Dao, which had been extremely solid, instantly began to collapse and overflow.Not good.Someone was breaking their world and great path universe. Damn it, how could this be?Who was it?The new martial artists were in Samsara. The other rank eights either stayed where they were to guard or went to the Thunder World. Besides, their world was near Samsara. Who would dare to attack their native world at this moment?Their outing was also a secret ...The three of them changed their expressions.Without this change, Li Hao's time would have been insignificant to them. Although it had some effect, it was not obvious at all. However, at this moment, their turbulent power of great DAOs was instantly frozen!Li Hao's eyes were also filled with joy!A chance!Sure enough, the Supreme of new martial arts had really gone to attack their local world."Condense!"The power of time erupted once more, freezing the three rank eights in place. On the other side, Kong Ji roared, and the world of Nirvana came crashing down. Two cat devoured everything, including the power of countless moans! Not far away, Fu Sheng sent Yuan flying with a palm strike. Suddenly, he felt something strange behind him. He hurriedly turned his head to look, and his expression changed instantly!At this moment, a huge change occurred in the two battlefields!The human King recovered to his peak, and Samsara and the others went through their tribulations at the same time.On Li Hao's side, the power of a great Dao overflowed from the three level 8s at the same time, as if someone had forcefully broken the universe and world of the great Dao and suffered a backlash. At this moment, they were frozen in time ...At this moment, he was the only one among the eight rank eights who was still intact. He was the only one who still had the time and opportunity to help them!In an instant, Fu Sheng abandoned Yuan Shuo and madly flew toward Li Hao. His expression changed drastically, and he couldn't care about anything else. He couldn't let the three level 8 powerhouses be killed, or the situation would be reversed!Everything had changed too quickly.Originally, he had the initiative in every aspect!"Stop!""Stop!" Fu Sheng roared, and the sound waves rushed toward Li Hao, trying to stop him and break his time star. As long as the time star was broken, it would not be easy for the other level 8s to kill the other three level 8s, even if they were overflowing with the power of great DAOs.Not far away, the expression of the reincarnation Emperor, who was fighting the Thunder tribulation, also changed!Damn it!He did not expect that lie tu Jie and sun Moon Jie would be attacked. He did it very discreetly. Samsara joined huntian very quickly without much hesitation. The two Jie joining huntian was also a secret.Almost no one knew that these three rank eights had come out, not even Fu Sheng and the others. Only the rank eight from the chaos race who was present knew.If it was so well hidden, who would attack the two low-profile level-eight universes?What went wrong?"Fu Sheng!""Die!" Reincarnation Emperor shouted. At this moment, he had sent venerable floating life, who had been afraid of the human King, to deal with Li Hao. He had become his life-saving straw!As long as Fu Sheng broke through the time star, the three grade 8 powerhouses would not die, but this group of people would."Break the stars!" Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  "Damn it!" The Samsara Emperor roared again. He didn't care whether Li Hao was dead or not. A rank seven couldn't turn the situation around. As long as he broke the stars and cut off time, Li Hao wouldn't be able to suppress three rank eights!At this moment, Wu Shan and the other two also came to their senses. They roared and attacked!He charged towards the three level eight venerable sovereigns!The three of them were suppressed by time, but they were still clear-headed. At this moment, the trouble was that they were attacked from both the inside and outside. It was difficult for them to escape. As long as they could take care of one side, they could fight back!The three of them struggled madly, and the power of their great DAOs continued to overflow as they looked at venerable monarch fleeting life!Breaking the stars!The time star floated above Li Hao's head. It didn't look too powerful. As long as they could break the star, they would still have a chance.As for venerable monarch fleeting life, he naturally understood all this.Li Hao also understood!Although this rank 8 was weak and not strong, if he attacked now and broke the stars, this comeback might be a complete failure.

Chapter 3439 Di Shi (3)
At this moment, he had to stop the other party, stop the other party.The few grade 8s had to deal with the grade 8s, while the grade 7s, solitary, ermao, and the others had to deal with either Spectre or the three grade 8s. None of them could escape.Whether or not they could stop Fu Sheng was of great importance!At this moment, Li Hao no longer hesitated. Suddenly, not far away, the world inside ermao's body rippled. Great separation realm!In an instant, the Li Dynasty was broken."Stop this level 8!" Li Hao roared.At this moment, a universe appeared. It was the Silvermoon universe. Qian Wuliang and the others who had been locked up in the Dali realm all appeared. They were still confused, but they couldn't care less.Qian Wuliang instantly performed the power of Dao, and the river of Dao merged with Hong Yitang. In the next second, a powerful force gathered on Black Panther.The Black Panther roared, and a sharp horn appeared on its head, just like the demon protector 's. On Li Hao's side, the chaos lightning tribulation triggered by time, as well as a portion of the lightning on the human King's side, suddenly gathered at the horn!In the next second, an extremely powerful God tribulation lightning burst out of the black leopard's head, directly blowing up its horn. The power of lightning went straight for Fu Sheng.At this moment, Li Hao could only hope that these people could stop the other party for a moment.Level eight was very powerful, but Black Panther and the other two were at the peak of level six. The great Dao universe and the two-Dao universe were three-in-one, and black Panther could use the power of tribulation lightning. Li Hao didn't know if he could stop them for a moment, but he could only try!Above Fu Sheng's head, a bolt of lightning struck down. However, he didn't care about this. With a roar, he appeared to be on the verge of death and blocked the lightning tribulation. At this time, he didn't have the mood to deal with those small fries.The most important thing was to break the stars!After killing Li Hao's group, he could deal with them at any time.The Black Panther roared. The previous lightning tribulation was extremely powerful, but to a rank 8, even if they took it head-on, they would only be injured at most. It was too difficult to kill Fu Sheng.The black leopard transformed into a 10000-foot body, hoping to stop the other party's advance.In just an instant, the black leopard's 10000-foot body was pierced through by venerable sovereign fleeting life without any resistance.A sixth-rank blocking an eighth-rank?How could that be possible?So what if it was comparable to Grade 7 now?He had only delayed them for an instant, but none of the three level 8s died. Just as they were about to approach Li Hao, a large number of spirits in the nearby area suddenly lost control. Not only that, but some of them also exploded!He was right beside venerable monarch fleeting life.Not far away, Lin Hongyu's hell, which was originally quite powerful, was instantly broken. The dozens of venerable sovereign undead guards that had been following her disappeared one after another and exploded, blocking the path of venerable sovereign Fu Sheng.However, it was no use.The self-destruction of these low-and mid-stage venerable sovereigns, and the self-destruction of the undead after death, could only be said to be negligible in stopping a level eight venerable sovereign.Venerable sovereign fleeting life roared, and the sound waves spread in all directions. The venerable sovereigns who wanted to stop him had their bodies cracked, their minds were in chaos, and death Qi overflowed. All of them spat out blood!There were many venerable sovereigns in the Dali realm who were in seclusion, but at this moment, no one could stop them. ​ If venerable sovereign fleeting life had not only wanted to destroy the stars, he might have been able to kill them all.There was a huge gap between an eighth-rank venerable sovereign and a lower-level venerable sovereign.Qian Wuliang and the others were also shocked. They didn't expect that they couldn't even stop the enemy for a moment. Was this the power of level 8?The voice of a God suddenly rang out in the void."God said, the chaos is boundless!"A chasm seemed to have appeared in front of monarch fleeting life. In the blink of an eye, he was thousands of meters away from Li Hao, but the illusion constructed by faith was shattered in the blink of an eye!
