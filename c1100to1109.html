        thirty-six heroes, heaven's legs might not be the best, but he was an indispensable part of Silver Moon martial forest. Silver Moon martial forest each had their own strengths, but heaven's legs had a special technique and was a rare special Martial Master.
        Yuan Shuo had killed a few seven sword swordsmen, but he did not kill him after defeating the heaven crippling feet. He knew that the secret skill was too difficult to pass down.
        The Silver Moon martial forest never took joy in breaking off inheritances.
        As for killing a few swordsmen ... In Yuan Shuo's eyes, Silver Moon martial forest didn't lack for such things.
        "Broken River!"
        With a fierce roar, Hong Yitang slashed across the air. This time, it wasn't a sword technique that could overturn the heavens and earth, but a sword technique that could break the river. This was a sure-kill sword technique, not the kind of sword technique that could overturn the heavens and earth and still had some defensive properties!
        With a sword, the river was broken. The sword fell from the sky. It was no longer majestic, but filled with killing intent!
        "Light!"
        With a low roar, the world seemed to fall like the sun. The Sword of Light was unleashed, and at this moment, both of them directly broke the superpower lock and unsealed their combat power. The sword slashed through the air from thousands of meters away!
        The divine intent was monstrous, and the sword momentum was soul-splitting.
         As for Xu Qing, he was also shocked. The next moment, he suddenly leaped into the air and ran away. At this moment, he was no longer arrogant.
        The two swords were here!
        Moreover, they broke the superpower lock and unsealed their combat power as soon as they met, unlike him, who had to consider and judge whether the spring of life was enough for him to repair. These people had no scruples.
        In this case, even if his actual combat power was stronger than the light sword, or even the earth overturning sword ... He couldn't unseal it.
        The more arrogant he was just now, the more pathetic he was now.
        Just as he was about to fly away, a bird's cry resounded through the air. Yuan Shuo rose from the ground and caught up with him in an instant. He shouted coldly,"If you don't die, how can the Silver Moon martial forest survive?"
        It wasn't as if the Silver Moon Martial Master hadn't died before, and it wasn't as if he had never been killed by outsiders.
        However, to kill one of the thirty-six people and even steal their secret technique, and to kill them with a sneak attack ... Even if silver Moon martial forest had to use all their strength, they would have to surround and kill this kind of person!
        At this moment, no one would care about the rules.
        "Get lost!"
        Yuan Shuo's kick caused the air to tremble, but he didn't care. He thrust his sword forward, and a creaking sound like metal rubbing against metal could be heard. Sparks appeared under his feet, and Li Hao took the opportunity to slash out!
        BOOM!
        A loud sound rang out as the master and disciple fell. Two bloody marks appeared on the other party's big feet. Xu Qing was in pain, but he couldn't care about that. Just as he was about to break out of the encirclement, a sword fell!
        BOOM!
        The next moment, the Sword of Light fell. He shouted and punched. With a bang, the light exploded and blood appeared on his hand.
        In an instant, the two swordsmen came together.
        The four of them surrounded him in the center.
        Xu Qing's expression was unsightly.
        The battle was so intense that he didn't check his communication Jade. Otherwise, he would have known that these two were approaching.
        However, Yuan Shuo and his disciple had pestered him for too long.
        "Kill!"
         "Kill!"  "Kill!"
        The three sides attacked at the same time. Three swords and one saber slashed at Xu Qing at the same time!
        Xu Qing gritted his teeth, his eyes flashing with madness.
        A bunch of bastards!
        You can kill the Silver Moon Martial Master, and you can kill others as well, but you're mad that I killed a crippled man?
        At this moment, he knew that he could no longer hesitate.
        In an instant, a monstrous aura burst out. The energy of the five elements flickered on his body, and more than half of the chains on his five internal organs were broken. His face was ashen, and his qi and blood rushed to the sky.
        "You ... Bastards!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He roared and kicked out!
        BOOM!
        The sword momentum exploded. Yuan Shuo and Li Hao were the first to lose and were sent flying with a stomp. Xu Qing ... Had been unsealed!
        Many of Yuan Shuo's bones were broken, and he fell to the ground. He spat out blood and pieces of his internal organs. He looked at Li Hao, who was also half-dead, and felt helpless.
        I'm already so F * cking strong ... How can I be a little better than Li Hao in the blink of an eye?
        Unsealing, how disgusting!
        He cursed in his heart. He looked at the twin swords and sighed. 'Forget it, I won't argue with you guys. You guys are strong, you can continue unsealing. You guys are a bunch of shameless guys, you can go beat them up!'
        The twin swords, on the other hand, were not afraid of Xu Qing.
        Xu Qing, who had been unsealed and was at full strength, was indeed powerful. However, the two of them were not weak either. Their swords swept across the sky, their feet crossed the sky, and their sword lights swept across the sky. Rays of light flashed across the sky!
        At this moment, Xu Qing's expression was also grave.
        Both sides were unsealing their combat strength!
        He didn't dare to delay. He had no other choice, but if Hong Yitang and the other two couldn't take him down ... They wouldn't have time to ask Li Hao for help to reseal him. The three of them were in a dangerous situation.
         Hong Yitang snorted and his eyes were sharp.
        In the next moment, the sound of a heart beating could be heard in the void. Suddenly, there was a crack as if something had broken. Xu Qing was surprised and shocked.
        Hong Yitang's aura suddenly skyrocketed and was even stronger than before. It even reached Xu Qing's level as he struck out with his sword!
        BOOM!
        With a loud sound, the Big Foot was directly cut open, revealing the White bones and blood.
        "Hong Yitang!"
        "You're very strong. If this goes on ... The three of us will not be able to hold on any longer. The lock will break ... Do you really have to do this?" Xu Qing shouted.
        He was unwilling to accept this!
        He didn't believe that the two people in front of him were willing to accept this.
        How could he be satisfied after cultivating to this level?
       
        Even now, they were not considered to be at their full strength. This was because the superpower lock had not been completely broken. They still had some hope. If it was not completely broken, it meant that they still had a chance.
        Once it was completely broken ... He would not have much of a chance.
        "If you had only killed Li Hao and Yuan Shuo ... Then it's fine. But if you killed the heaven's leg breaker in a direct battle, then it's fine! You assassinated him, didn't you?"
        Hong Yitang shouted,"Silver Moon Martial Master, you can afford to lose!" You killed him face to face, and you're still quite a character. You dare to assassinate him!"
        Xu Qing cursed in his heart!
        What was the difference?
        'Even if I were to fight them head on, I might not be able to defeat them. It's just to save some time and avoid some trouble. These people are all acting like they don't kill.'
        BOOM!
        The sword Qi once again swept across the air. In the void, the three of them instantly fought. Xu Qing, who had unsealed his full combat strength, was still suppressed by the two of them. In the blink of an eye, the armor on his body was already broken.
        The next moment, a soldier soul appeared.
         The soul of the armor, which had not appeared all this while, suddenly appeared. It was like a monster that looked like an Earth Dragon.
        At this moment, Li Hao's eyes lit up as he snatched the starry sky sword from below. The self-severing sword flashed in his eyes as he stabbed upwards!
        "Break!"
        The soldier soul had not appeared all this while because it was afraid of the starry sky sword. However, at this moment, it had no choice but to appear as it was about to be shattered. It had originally thought that the person below had no more combat power.
        Who would have thought that ... At this moment, Li Hao would actually charge forward crazily!
        Xu Qing was furious!
        ,m He stomped his foot at Li Hao. This guy was looking for death.  But Li Hao dared to take the risk ... Because he trusted, or rather, he gambled!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He gambled that the two swords could protect him.
        Sure enough, in an instant, the earth overturning sword appeared. The sword swept through the sky and turned the world upside down. That Big Foot seemed to stomp towards the sky. On top of it was the light sword, and the sword stabbed down!
        "Break!" Xu Qing roared, trying to break the momentum.
        However, Li Hao didn't care about all these. He only had one goal, and that was the soldier soul!
        BOOM!
        One sword, Five Forces, I won't turn back!
        BOOM!
        The sound of an explosion could be heard. The Earth Dragon-like soldier soul revealed a look of fear. It was as if the small sword had seen a dessert. This might be the biggest soldier soul it had eaten so far. The small sword seemed to have turned into a black hole. It stabbed into the soldier soul's body, and in an instant, an extremely strong suction force exploded.
        The next moment, the soldier soul let out a shrill cry that came from the soul.
        "Longevity sword ..."
        Bang! Bang!
         The soldier soul exploded!  At the same time, the earth-overturning sword slashed out. Previously, the extremely strong armor could only be damaged by the stone saber and the starry sky sword. Even the two great swordsmen had only been able to cut a few fragments of the armor. This time, under the sword of the earth-overturning sword, it was like tofu. With a crack, it completely shattered!
        It shattered!
        This powerful weapon, the heaven-grade armor, was also the armor that Xu Qing had not suffered much damage from the battle until now. However, the moment the soldier soul appeared, it was instantly shattered.
        Xu Qing's eyes revealed a hint of anger, a hint of anger and unwillingness.
        Puchi!
        The sword of overturning the earth struck out once again, and the Sword of Light struck out at the same time. With the two of them working together, Xu Qing was distracted. In the blink of an eye, bloody wounds were left on his body, and even a lot of his flesh had been cut.
        From the beginning, he could still resist, but now, it was obvious that he could no longer resist!
        His eyes were cold.
        "You ... Must you all die with me?"
        BOOM!
        One of the chains seemed to have completely broken at this moment. A monstrous fire appeared and burned his entire body. The flames covered Xu Qing. At this moment, he had chosen to break completely.
        There was no more room for negotiation!
        The chain in his heart broke, and his fire power exploded. His heart was also burning.
        At this moment, this valiant High Duke had completely given up on those unrealistic hopes. He no longer held back. He broke the chains and revealed a mocking expression."Since you're forcing me to die ... Then we'll die together!"
        The earth overturning sword and the radiant sword had been unsealed, but ... Did they dare to completely break them?
        Then there would be no more hope!
        Below, Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes. It was really annoying to encounter such an enemy. He kept unleashing his power, breaking a little, breaking half, breaking all ... Damn it, what kind of cultivation level had all the martial masters reached?
        "Four ... No, eight locks are saturated, right?" Hong Yitang asked calmly. Xu Qing, it's not a fluke that you can dominate the East!"
         "I'm still alright!"
        Xu Qing looked at Hong Yitang like a fire giant and said coldly,""You're so calm, it looks like you're very confident ... I want to see what exactly gives you the confidence. Earthcover sword, since you've forced me to do this, don't think about having an easy time!"
        Hong Yitang laughed."You've only broken one. Go on and break the second one ... Let's see if your five internal organs can withstand it ... If not ... You'd better wait for death!"
        "Dead?"
        "Hmph!" Xu Qing snorted coldly. This time, he stomped his foot, and flames burned the sky.
        Then let's see who will die.
        Even if I die, I won't let you have a good time. What makes you have the confidence to say this?
        At worst, we'll just die together!
        At this moment, Hong Yitang seemed to be about to make a big move. Li Hao, who had landed on the ground, was also extremely nervous. He glanced at Yuan Shuo beside him and was extremely nervous. So many people had joined forces, but they still couldn't kill Xu Qing ... He had to admit that he could escape because Xu Qing was afraid of death and didn't dare to unseal his seal.
        Hong Yitang took a deep breath as if he was preparing for a big move. Perhaps he would break or unlock more super locks.
       
        The next moment, Li Hao heard a deafening roar."Look, look, look at your mother! Come out and kill him!"
        "Hahaha, he's here!"
        A fist appeared between heaven and earth, and it seemed to be able to cover the entire world!
        "Northern fist!"
        Xu Qing was shocked!
        "Hahaha, Xu Qing, you should be honored today!"
        "There's still this Lord!"
        The long saber swept across the sky, and the color of heaven and earth changed.
        "BA Dao!"
        Xu Qing couldn't hold it in any longer. His face instantly turned pale, revealing a deathly gray color!
         Earth overturning sword, light sword, Northern fist, Overlord blade ... And there was also old demon five birds, Demon Sword Li Hao ...
        He suddenly smiled.
        Perhaps, Northern fist was right. Being killed today was an honor.
        The Silver Moon martial masters had actually joined forces.
        BA Dao was incomparably cold. He slashed out from the sea, covering the sky and earth."We also want to see what it'll be like after it's completely broken. Now, it seems like ... It's just like that!"
        Northern fist chuckled."You have to follow the rules. Crippled heaven's feet and I don't get along, but you can't assassinate him. If you kill him directly, I'll give you a round of applause ... Xu Qing, you have to follow the rules!"
        BOOM!
        The fist print landed and directly smashed the Big Foot.
        The Overlord blade slashed down and instantly chopped off one of Xu Qing's arms. At this moment, even if one of Xu Qing's superpower locks was broken and he was surrounded by the four powerhouses, he had no power to fight back. He had completely lost the ability to fight back.
        There was nothing he could do.
        Below, Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes.
        Unfortunately, I can't unseal it. I'm so envious ... Bah, I despise it. Four against one, shameless!
        At this moment, Xu Qing's heart was like dead ashes.
        At this moment, a wave of fluctuation shook the surroundings. In the void, a cough could be heard."Qing 'er assassinated the heaven's crippled foot and lost an arm. He deserves to be punished ... Silver Moon martial masters, can you show mercy?"
        In an instant, a massive flame appeared between heaven and earth, and within the flame, there seemed to be some water waves.
        Bei Quan raised his eyebrows while BA Dao looked into the distance and smiled.
        Earthcover sword also chuckled."The Duke of the third generation is still alive. It seems like he has stepped into the realm of rising light and completely unsealed his combat power. Fire and water are compatible. Are you not afraid of dying?"
        "Father ..."
        Xu Qing sighed and looked at the person who was stepping on the air in the distance. He was a little depressed and did not look happy.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Duke of the third generation was a super powerful being.
        An expert with six broken super locks!
        But now, if an expert with six paths of superpower lock went all out ... Almost all of them would die. Even if they had plenty of spring of life, it would be difficult to recover.
         In the distance, the senile old man sighed.""I don't want to either ... But you're all here. If I don't come out soon, Xu Qing will probably be completely dead. He lost an arm and a superpower lock ... He can't become a Martial Master anymore, so he can only become a superpower ... I wonder if you can make up for Fu Shatian's broken leg with this price?"  Li Hao blinked!
        F * ck!
        The Xu family really did have other powerhouses. This must be the Xu family powerhouse that Xu Qing had mentioned was hiding in the remains, right?
        His father!
        It was said that the third generation Duke dingguo had died thirty years ago. Not long after Yuan Shuo challenged Xu Qing, this person passed the throne to Xu Qing.
        Above the rising light!
        This was the first time that Li Hao had encountered someone above sunrise. He was not a Martial Master, but someone who had really broken six super locks. Li Hao did not see the powerful light until he got closer and saw it.
        The old man seemed to have sensed it too. He looked at Li Hao and nodded slightly.
        Li Hao's heart turned cold!
        So strong!
        When he looked at the human light orbs, it seemed like this was the first time someone had sensed them.
        There were too many experts from Silvermoon today, and even this fellow was forced to show himself.
        In all directions, the experts who were hiding far away were also secretly shocked.
        The Xu family's Foundation had appeared!
        All the major forces knew that some people had broken through, but they didn't dare to show themselves. Now, the Xu family was the first to reveal a powerhouse above the rising light realm, the third generation Duke.
        Hong Yitang laughed."After killing Silver Moon Martial Master or ambushing him in the dark ... Do you think it'll end with a beyond the rising light? Old Duke, you're thinking too simply. The Xu family ... If they want to be the first to stand out ... Then ... Kill them!"
        In an instant, the two swords slashed out!
        A punch and a blade, they were aimed at one person at the same time-Xu Qing!
        Xu Qing's face was filled with despair, and the old Duke seemed to know the style of these Silver Moon martial masters. At this moment, the power of water and fire also burst out, and a monstrous force swept through the world.
        "I knew it ... It's a pity that I didn't manage to stop Qing 'er back then!"
        Killing a Silver Moon Martial Master could be done directly, and no one would care. Even silver Moon wouldn't care. However, it was a taboo to secretly kill an opponent and steal their secret technique.
         However, there was no medicine for regret.
        At this moment, he did not care about that. There was no need to hide his strength. Above the rising light was enough to deal with these martial masters who had not completely broken the Super Lock.
        In an instant, everyone felt the combination of Ice and Fire!
        However, none of the four powerhouses stepped in to stop him.
        Everyone was trying to kill Xu Qing!
        As if he didn't see or feel the threat, Xu Qing's eyes revealed a hint of confusion and unwillingness ... Why ... Didn't he stop them?
        Do you all really want to die with me?
        'Even if not all of them, some of them should be sent to stop my father. Why ... Do all of you want to kill me?'
        The next moment, he understood.
        At that moment, a huge sword flew out from the sky and fell. An extremely powerful metal-elemental power exploded. It was majestic, overbearing, vicious, and murderous ...
       
        Too much will was integrated into it.
        The sword fell with a loud boom. In the next second, the old Duke, who had just exploded with power, spat out blood and retreated. His eyes were filled with shock."You ... Also broke the sixth superpower lock!"
        In the air, a man was floating and looking at him. The Super power on his body swept through the world and he was just looking at him coldly.
        The old Duke looked at his son and smiled sadly."The Xu family ... Shouldn't have come out like this!"
        With a sigh, he disappeared.
        The man in the air looked on coldly and didn't stop him. Xu Qing looked a little sad, but he laughed,""It's my ... Honor!"
        "Hahaha!"
        "Today's death is not a loss!"
        Puchi!
        His head flew out!
         This top-notch expert, the Overlord of the East, an extremely powerful existence, was beheaded by a sword that covered the ground at this moment!
        Xu Qing suddenly exploded!
        In the distance, the old Duke fled quickly, his eyes revealing a hint of sorrow. 'My most outstanding son, the one in the entire Xu family who has the greatest hope of breaking through the boundary and truly stepping into the existence of the rising light as a Martial Master.'
        He was dead!
        He died right after he appeared.
        He had been killed right under the eyes of the sunrise.
        But he ... Was powerless.
        We can't fight anymore. If we continue, the entire Xu family's Foundation will be destroyed.
        More and more Silver Moon experts appeared.
        They were all charging over madly.
        Silver moon's son's act of killing the heaven's crippling feet had incurred public outrage. Otherwise, he would not have insisted on killing Xu Qing for Li Hao's sake.
        He turned his head to look at the man in the air ... Tian Jian!
        A non-Martial Master who had stepped onto the path of superpowers and broken six shackles had actually come out of seclusion. Furthermore, his condition seemed to be much more stable than his own. Why?
        In the air, the middle-aged man looked down at the crowd and then at Yuan Shuo. He said coldly,""I'll wait for you in the next realm. Don't make me wait too long!"
        In an instant, he tore through the void and disappeared.
        Yuan Shuo snorted coldly,"you superhuman!."
        He cursed, but he was a little depressed.
        艹!
        'I've fused my Five Forces and am invincible. In the blink of an eye, a group of people has come, none of them weaker than me. '
        No, or rather, they were both stronger than him.  But ... So what?
        Be it unsealing or superpowers, they were not the right path!
        Yes, that was it.
        He consoled himself. 'If I don't unseal myself, if I don't become a superpower, I'll be the strongest ... These people can't compare to me.'
        At this moment, Hong Yitang smiled as he looked at the disappearing Tian Jian. He suddenly smiled and said,"He ran away! If we don't run ... From all directions, the sun will come ... The wind will be tight ..."
        "Whoosh!"
        The others all laughed and scattered in all directions.
        Yuan Shuo grabbed Li Hao and the Black Dog, and they quickly fled.
        At this point, if they stayed, there would probably be people above the rising light coming from all directions.
        The dynasty was probably going to be shaken by the continuous emergence of sunrise in this battle.
        Of course, Xu Qing's death would cause a huge uproar.
        ……
        All the experts who were hiding in the dark all turned pale.
        "The heavenly Sword ... Is above the rising light!"
        "And the old Duke ... He's unstable, but the heavenly Sword is stable. Why is that?"
        "The old Duke was obviously no match for him. He knew that he would die if he stayed, so he could only escape. It's a pity for Xu Qing ... If this fellow was given more time ... It's such a pity ..."
        "Silver Moon and his bunch of lunatics have all charged out like a swarm of bees, and their entire family's history has been exposed!"
        "The Xu family's heritage is still deep. As expected of one of the three great families. The old Duke is still alive ... And he's quietly stepped into the realm of rising light ... I just don't know if the Xu family will start a war with Silver Moon ..."
        Some people were talking to each other. In the next moment, they all left.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He couldn't stay in this place any longer.
        Although the Duke of dingguo had died, the Xu family had not completely disappeared. Next, perhaps the Xu family would be the first major force to bring all their hidden combat power to the table.
        Otherwise, the East would be in chaos and they wouldn't be able to intimidate the four sides!
        There were too many things contained in the death of Duke dingguo. Everyone knew that an even bigger storm was brewing.
        ……
        Bang! Bang!
        The waves crashed down, devouring the scene of the battle.
        In the distance, the Donghai Bridge had also completely collapsed.
        After everyone had left, it didn't take long for powerful experts to appear. They quietly observed the area and tried to gain some enlightenment, then quickly left.
        Above the rising sun, he had officially walked out. It seemed that next, these people would have to find a way to stabilize their condition and welcome the next attack.
       
        "Hahaha!"
        His laughter echoed in the sea.
        The group of people scattered and fled in all directions. The pain and pleasure of being free to fly in the sky and fish to jump in the sea emerged in everyone's hearts.
        Cool!
        The Silver Moon Martial Master had been silent for too long.
        Today, a group of top-notch martial masters had joined forces to kill the overlord of the East, Xu Qing. Who would not be happy?
        I'll let you kill the heavens and cripple your feet!
        To put it nicely, Silver Moon martial masters were a group of powerhouses who pursued freedom. To put it bluntly, they were a group of bandits. However, they still had a bottom line, but it wasn't that strong.
        However, Xu Qing's assassination of the heaven's crippled feet had crossed this line.
        If Xu Qing had killed the crippled heaven feet in a direct confrontation, he would have mocked them for being trash and losing to a foreign Martial Master in a martial arts competition. They deserved to be killed.
         It was such a complicated group of people with double standards.
        But today, all of them had come.
        Save Li Hao!
        A Silver Moon Martial Master could be killed, but not in this way. Xu Qing was a big bully ... Even if Li Hao was the one looking for trouble, Xu Qing would find someone of the same generation!
        Hmm ... He was just that shameless!
        His laughter echoed in the sea.
        Bei Quan's laughter came from afar."I'll be leaving first. Li Hao, as a Silver Moon Martial Master, you have to follow the rules! "We Silver Moon people have been called barbarians, and it's all because of you guys who don't follow the rules ... Be a good person, and the next time we meet, I hope it won't be like this. Kill the Xu family ... Can't you just ask that Zhao guy for a document first?" For example, if the Xu family revolted, if the Xu family raised bandits for self-respect, if they colluded with Pirates, if you represented the dynasty to destroy them! Now, you're acting like a robber. How embarrassing!"
        As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.
        Northern fist and BA Dao hadn't been unsealed much, and they hadn't been fighting for long, so they didn't need Li Hao's help to suppress anything. Now that they had finished fighting and killing, this group of experts who didn't like each other wouldn't get together to reminisce about the past.
        I don't have the mood!
        Moreover, Yuan Shuo was still here. They couldn't be bothered to look at this old man.
        He didn't even say hello!
        Bei Quan didn't mention Yuan Shuo at all. BA Dao was even colder than bei Quan. He didn't say a word and left directly.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They were not the same!
        They might seem to be in cahoots on the outside, but if they really returned to Silver Moon and their strength was on par with each other, the news would spread the next day that domineering blade had killed Northern fist, Northern fist had killed light sword, and light sword had killed Southern Fist ...
        Yes, it was just so ridiculous.
        The two of them could leave, but the earth overturning sword and the Sword of Light couldn 't. They had been unsealed a lot, and they still needed Li Hao's help to suppress them.
        Therefore, at this moment, the four of them and the dog were together.
        Yuan Shuo sneered!
        His face was full of disdain!
        Even if her strength was inferior, she was still disdainful and didn't even bother to look at the two people. The two people were the same, not looking at Yuan Shuo. The earth overturning sword was better, but the light sword didn't even look at her. Because when she looked at Yuan Shuo, he sneered, as if he was going to hit her.  Clearly, this old thing held a grudge.
        He remembered the hatred for the news that he had spread.
        She had bullied Li Hao with her light sword.
        At this moment, Li Hao also felt the strange atmosphere. These guys had just joined forces to kill the enemy with great tacit understanding, but in the blink of an eye ... The enemy was dead. Why did it feel like a great battle was about to break out?
        Hong Yitang was still fine, but his own master ... Why did Hong Yitang seem to be hostile?
        Hong Yitang was unperturbed.
        He was not in a hurry at all and just wandered around the eastern sea leisurely.
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, sneered.
        Hong Yitang knew why he was smiling like that. He didn't show it on his face, but he was sneering in his heart. 'I'll let you be jealous. Do you think that your disciple is going to be gone soon?'
        Hehe!
        I told you to run, run to the central region. If you didn't appear this time, your disciple ... Might be my disciple in a few days.
        Hehe!
        Of course, Hong Yitang didn't think that he cared about it. He was too good at causing trouble. He couldn't handle it. In the past few days, he had fought many times for Li Hao. He felt that this guy was more competitive than Yuan Shuo.
        That's good too, let Yuan Shuo join them!
        In this group of four people and a dog, apart from Heibao, who was groaning in pain, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo were both seriously injured. The other two, who had been unsealed, felt that their internal organs were also somewhat unable to take it, but they held on and did not make a sound.
        When no one was around, he could call out to her.
        As long as they were alive, especially if they didn't get along well with someone, they wouldn't lose. Even if they were in pain to death, they wouldn't make a sound.
        Seeing that no one said anything, Li Hao had to say,""Where are we going to heal?"
        He had to find a place!
        I can't just keep floating on the sea, right?
         The three of you are so cold. Tell me where you're going. Why are you running around?
        "Ask him!"
        The light sword and the earth overturning sword looked at Yuan Shuo at the same time.
        Yuan Shuo appeared to be slightly interested, but Hong Yitang said indifferently,""A man who has been digging graves for dozens of years must have many bases. He might have been here in the sea too. He must have been to Eastern continent and Eastern Sea. Otherwise, how could he fight with Xu Qing?"
        Yuan Shuo's eyes were cold."Don't think that just because you've lit up a few more shackles, you can be so arrogant! Are you allowed to discuss my matters?"
        "That's true. I won't say it next time. After all, you're older. I have to give in to you, right, brother Yuan?"the Earthcover sword said calmly.
        “……”
        Li Hao didn't say anything. They wouldn't fight here, would they?
        They had never fought in the past!
        Also, Hong Yitang's temper wasn't bad before. Why did it seem so bad today?
       
        It was a little provocative.
        As for his own master ... It was no surprise that the old devil had always been so arrogant.
        As for the light sword, it was as if it was transparent, not saying a word. It even seemed to be gloating over his misfortune. It looked like ... They were about to fight!
        As expected, Silver Moon martial masters weren't normal.
        Li Hao ridiculed in his heart.
        The arrogant Tian Jian only said a few words to Yuan Shuo, and no one else had the chance to see him. He suppressed the old Duke with a single strike and left.
        The rules ... The northern fist that was a little hypocritical.
        The cold and arrogant BA Dao.
        In any case, these people were not normal in Li Hao's eyes. Of course ... He still felt good that they had come to help. After all, he was a Silver Moon citizen. When he saw someone from the same hometown, his eyes would be filled with tears. It was better to have someone from the same hometown.
        Yuan Shuo snorted and did not bother to say anything more.
         In front of his own disciple, he was still quite restrained. After all, it was not easy to maintain the image of a scholar. His disciple had always believed that he was a kind and good person. He could not break the image.
        As for Li Hao ... He used to think this way, but he really didn't think this way now.
        It could only be said that the teacher was too immersed in the character.
        After hearing so many rumors about his teacher, Li Hao would be a fool to believe that his teacher was kind and gentle.
        "Let's go to the East Coast. I have a house there, but I haven't been there for many years. I don't know if it's still there or if it's been taken over."
        The earth-overturning sword revealed an expression of "as expected."
        I knew it!
        The group of people flew quickly toward the Eastern Shore.
        ……
        At this moment, the news had already exploded.
        Today, the entire dynasty's upper echelons could be considered to have watched a great show.
        At the inspection Office.
        The Secretary had returned.
        Looking at the information, he laughed,"like I said, When two tigers fight, one side will die!" Good ... But Xu Qing is too useless, and the Xu family is too cowardly. They didn't even manage to kill a Silver Moon Martial Master. We've only watched half of the show, and it's not fun!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If a few of them died, Silver Moon and the Xu family would go to war, and the world would be turned upside down. Both sides would then continue to use their trump cards, and in the end, it would be best if silver Moon and the Xu family dug out old antique. Old antique would then start a war, and the East and North would go to war. That would be the best!  No one knew what this person was thinking.
        The surrounding people didn't say a word.
        The head Minister of the night patrol was also here, and so was the Deputy Minister, Huang Long. These two were the Deputy Directors of the inspection Division. At this moment, they were here to participate in the high-level meeting and analyze the impact of this incident.
        After all, a high-ranking official had died, the governor of the border, the Overlord of the East.
        He still had to manage this matter.
        Otherwise, the dignity of the dynasty would be completely lost. After all, the Xu family was one of the three founding Dukes.
        At this moment, Huang Long spoke first,"Secretary, let's talk about the follow-up." This Li Hao and the other Silvermoon bandits killed the Duke of dingguo. How should we deal with them?"
        "The Marquis of dingguo!"
        The director corrected him and frowned.""Don't take it lightly! Don't treat it as an empty document! "He, Xu Qing, initiated the battle of the city-destroying bombs first. This is a mistake, a mistake in the general direction. I don't care if he did it for self-defense or to kill the enemy, it's not okay! This is the dynasty's punishment for him and the Xu family. If you address me as such in such a formal setting ... You'll have to suffer!"
        Huang Long said nothing.
        He was on night patrol and dared to challenge the Head of the Department.
        However, he didn't dare to challenge this person here.
        The ninth Division had been established for 80 years, and this man was the second Secretary of the inspection Division. The first one was his father, who had been in power for 50 years, and this man had been in power for 30 years. None of the secretaries of the ninth Division were easy to deal with.
         After the Secretary finished speaking, he didn't continue. He swept his gaze across the crowd and didn't ask for their opinions. He thought for a while and smiled,""How about this, send a document to Silver Moon. Didn't Silver Moon say that Li Hao would be promoted? He agreed! Li Hao went to exterminate the bandits. He killed the bandit of East Ocean, red beard, and earned merit!"
        Huang Long's expression changed slightly.
        The next moment, the Secretary said,"in addition, arrest the earth overturning sword, light sword, North fist, BA Dao, and old demon five birds. These five Guys joined forces to kill the Marquis of dingguo. They are guilty of great crimes. Let the military court directly dispatch the star Army to encircle and annihilate them. Let the king of Pingyuan assist. The royal family also has the obligation to deal with these bandits!"
        "Since the old Duke is not dead and is still alive ... His son is dead ... How about this, let the old Duke choose another son to inherit the title of Marquis of dingguo. He has many sons anyway, so the title of Marquis will still belong to his Xu family!"
        The Inspector General's Secretary said a few words and thought for a while before saying,"By the way, the director of the dongbin Administrative Bureau can't shirk his responsibility for the city-destroying bombs. From him, to the garrison Marshal, the Patrol Division Secretary, and the head of the night patrol Division, all of them are to be dismissed!"
        "In addition, as for the heavenly Sword villa ... Forget it. The heavenly Sword only exchanged one blow with the high Duke ... It's normal for superpowers to spar. Let's not bother about it."
        The arrest of the Silver Moon Martial Master, the selection of people to take over the Duke's Manor, the promotion of Li Hao, and the execution of the leaders of the East Coast ...
        In a few words, this person made a decision.
        Some people wanted to refute, but the inspection Division Secretary, who didn't look too big, patted the table.""Let's do this! The death of a former Marquis is also a loss to the dynasty. However, I've always found Xu Qing an eyesore ... Let the imperial family confer him a title. Huang Long, go to the imperial family and ask for a title!"
        Huang Long's expression changed slightly, but he still nodded. After a moment of silence, he spoke,"Secretary, Li Hao's promotion ... Is it ... Open for discussion?"
       
        A provincial governor!
        These were the most important people in the Inspector General's system. Previously, hou Xiaochen was an Inspector General, and so was Kong Jie. Under normal circumstances, there would only be two of them in a province, and that depended on whether the local Inspector General and the head of the night patrol were powerful or not.
        If it was a weak one, there might only be one. He could choose one.
        He, Huang Long, was actually only an Imperial inspector according to his rank. However, when he arrived at stellarsky city, he did not pay much attention to these things. Instead, he looked at his actual position and strength.
        The Inspector General looked at him with some doubt. After a moment, he smiled: "What, you have an opinion?"
        "No..."
        "Then let's do this!"
        After the inspector finished speaking, he added,"Oh right, I forgot that you're also the night patrolman, the northern Governor. I'll give you a mission ... The mission to arrest the five great bandits. Take it. You'll kill as many of them as you can!"
        For a moment, Huang Long felt as if he had eaten sh * t.
        However, the Secretary was right. This ... This was indeed the responsibility of the northern Governor.
         Pursue and annihilate the bandits!
        However, even the weakest of the five, Yuan Shuo, was extremely powerful now. Yuan Shuo, who had fused the five Forces, had directly risen to the level of the metamorphosis stage.
        Moreover, that disciple of his was not weak now.
        To be able to escape from Xu Qing, even if he had not been unsealed at the beginning, he still had the strength of a metahuman. This meant that Li Hao had the ability to fight against a metahuman. In addition, the way he killed Redbeard ... Even a metahuman would have to be wary of him.
        How to deal with it?
        Huang Long understood that this was the punishment the Secretary gave him for interrupting. In the nine divisions, it was the rule of the family. Whatever the Secretary said was true and could not be refuted.
        However, he was really unwilling to accept this!
        Silver Moon had only gained five more wanted criminals, so in reality, they had not lost anything.
        As for the high Duke's public house ... He did not really care about it, but the Secretary's actions clearly showed that she was biased towards Silver Moon. Why?
        He could not understand.
        The head of the inspection Division should not have any relationship with Silver Moon, so was he just going to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight?
        And hou Xiaochen ...
        Thinking of this, he suppressed the urge to continue talking and changed the topic.""Secretary, I will do my best! "In addition, Deputy Minister hou Xiaochen previously caused a ruckus at tenstar Academy ..."
        The Inspector General seemed to be thinking about something. After a moment, he smiled and said,"Yes, although he was carrying out a mission, his attitude was too rough! He had even killed a teacher in the Academy. Even if he was guilty, he would be judged! The inspection Office and the night patrol have the power to enforce the law, but they can't be used indiscriminately!"
        After saying that, he smacked the table in anger and said coldly,""Hou Xiaochen got used to being the head of Silvermoon, so he forgot that this is Heavenly Star City! He would be demoted by one class and demoted to an advanced envoy! I'll deduct three years of salary as a warning to others!"
        Huang Long immediately frowned.
        Not only him, the other Deputy Secretary also frowned slightly and said,""Secretary, is it ... Too light? The Heavenly Star Academy is a dynasty institution of higher learning jointly established by the nine divisions and the imperial family. Hou Xiaochen's side is too unscrupulous. "  The inspector nodded again,"that's true!" It's a little light, it doesn't hurt, he doesn't learn his lesson ..."
        He seemed to hesitate for a moment, but it also seemed like he was deliberately waiting for something.
        When the others were silent, he said,""In this case, isn't he the governor of heavenstar? Order him to capture and kill thousands of members of the three major Darksider organizations within three months, no less than a hundred of the three suns and no less than ten sunguangs, to atone for his crimes ... That's it!"
        Everyone's expression changed when they heard this.
        What did that mean?
        Should he take the initiative to send hou Xiaochen to fight the three major organizations?
        Furthermore, it was the support of one of the nine divisions, the inspection Division, a law enforcement agency ... What was the Secretary trying to do?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Did he want to go to war with the three great organizations, or did he want to kill hou Xiaochen with a borrowed knife?
        They didn't know.
        Because it was all possible.
        Was it because of the death of the Duke dingguo that this person was unwilling to be lonely?
        As for Huang Long and the others, they were feeling even worse. This way, he, hou Xiaochen, would have an official name and the support of the head of the inspection Division to attack the three major organizations. If that was the case ... With hou Xiaochen's personality, he might use this as an excuse to directly mobilize the experts from the inspection Division and the night patrol.
        This was because this was the order of the Inspector General.
        Even though Huang Long and the Minister were only deputy secretaries, the Inspector General still had a strong influence and power.
        His authority was still strong.
        "Alright, the meeting is over!"
         Seeing that he was about to leave in a hurry, one of the Deputy secretaries had no choice but to say,""Chief, there's one more thing that hasn't been dealt with."
        ? "Oh, there's more?"
        "Yes,"
        "There's a letter from the Division of Administration,"the man said,"they're talking about the merger of the organizations and the unified execution ..."
        The matter was simple.
        The Division of Administration suggested that the 99 provinces under it should undergo a reform to determine the position of the provincial governor. For example, Silver Moon should make it so that the administration department had the role of commander, and make it clear that the other organizations were under the jurisdiction of the administration department.
        He even suggested that the Governor-General be a permanent official position.
        In fact, there were already some provinces that were like this, such as Linjiang.
        "Upgrade the administration Bureau and change its name to governor's mansion. The governor will be the director of the administration Bureau.
        The inspector smiled,"do you think the world isn't chaotic enough?" Does he have to make some local overlords or does he think that he has the final say in the administration department? even if it's a little chaotic, it can weaken the power of the other eight departments?"
       
        No one made a sound.
        There were too many things involved.
        When the nine divisions were first established, the Division of Administration was first, but the military law Division and the inspection Division were not weak either. Although they were first in name, one of them held military power, and the other held the power of local law enforcement.
        In the past few years, the Division of Administration had wanted to take back his power and had proposed to build a governor's mansion many times.
        But they were all rejected!
        Now that he mentioned it again, the inspector bureau chief thought for a while and smiled,""It's not impossible! However, we can't directly appoint the director of the administration Bureau as the governor. That's too inappropriate. How can a scholar be the governor when the building is about to collapse?"
        As soon as these words came out, everyone's expression changed.
        An old and wise man reminded him in a low voice,""Secretary, be careful with your words!"
        The building was about to collapse!
        The star dynasty had been established for 200 years. The nine divisions were stable and the royal family was in hiding. Other than the three major superpower organizations causing trouble, everything was peaceful. With the application of the technology excavated from the ruins, it felt like flowers were blooming.
         However, this person in charge of one of the nine divisions actually said such words ... This was too horrifying.
        Even if many people thought the same, no one dared to say it.
        "Hahaha, alright, I won't say that. I'll just reply to them like this."
        With that, he turned around and left.
        Only after they had left did everyone heave a sigh of relief. Huang Long also took the opportunity to pour out his grievances,"On the Secretary's side, not only did he not punish Silver Moon Li Hao, he even promoted him. Isn't this encouraging such a trend? I think that Li Hao is the source of the chaos. How many people has he killed in such a short time?"
        "If you dare to break into the high Duke's public house today, you might even dare to break into the nine divisions tomorrow."
        Some of the people present laughed in agreement, some pretended not to hear it, and some said calmly,""If you don't agree with the Secretary's decision, then tell the Secretary. It's no use telling us."
        Huang Long cursed in his heart!
        If it makes sense, why would I tell you?
        Didn't I just want you to join hands to oppose it?
        As for the Head of Department who looked like a Buddha statue, he picked up his large teacup at this moment, stood up leisurely, and walked out. From the beginning to the end, he didn't say a word. He was extremely leisurely, as if everything had nothing to do with him.
        The others were no longer surprised.
        At this moment, they were discussing other things, such as the madness and boldness of the Silver Moon martial masters, their strength, and the strength of the sixth level cultivators.
        While they were still discussing, news came very quickly.
        A high-ranking official quickly entered the venue and said loudly,""A piece of news has just started to spread, and it's spreading rapidly ..."
        Everyone was listening attentively. They had been in a meeting just now and didn't pay attention.
        What news had spread?  The official who entered the door felt his scalp go numb from being stared at. He quickly said,""Due to the emergence of a Level-6 master in the East, SuperPower City quickly made the news public and named the level, promoting it quickly ..."
        Someone was startled. The next moment, someone cursed,""The city of supers? What's the other side doing! Do they even have the right to name it?"
        This was not a matter of name.
        It was a question of dominance in the field of superpower.
        Even if they were to name it, that was the night patrolmen's business. They were the only law enforcement agency with supernatural powers.
        The superpower City was also in the central region.
        It was a city of supers built by supers. Someone had told Li Hao about it in the past, but Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it at the time.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Someone also patted his head and said in frustration,""I didn't think of this and they got there before me. These guys ... They're really bastards! Tell me, what are their names?"
        "Divine-tier!"
        "What?"
        "Divine-tier!"
        The messenger repeated. Some were confused, some frowned slightly, and some seemed to realize something, their expressions changing slightly.
        "Did they say why it was named like that?"
        "There's an explanation! It was said that the sixth level was to break through the five organs and two locks. Once the two elements were combined, one would have a divine power! It truly has the power to destroy a city and destroy a country ..."
        Divine power!
        At this moment, someone understood and said coldly,""It seems that a divine-tier elite has appeared in the city of supers! I was wondering why they were so eager to show off their strength and attract more supers. It seems like ... The influence of the war in the east has completely emerged!"
         Those at the sixth level couldn't hold it in anymore.
        With the appearance of the old Duke of the Duke dingguo's mansion and the heavenly Sword, if they didn't appear now, then whether it was the nine divisions, the royal family, the three great organizations ... Or the overlords ...
        These people, these forces, if they did not have a sixth realm to hold the fort ... Even though the Duke dingguo's mansion had suffered heavy losses this time, a sixth realm was enough to make up for everything and even attract more powerful cultivators and forces to join them.
        There was no other reason. They had existences above the rising light.
        As for the city of superpower, it was not important to announce the name of the realm. The key was that the other party used a not-so-tactful way to tell everyone that they had a divine-tier elite in the city of superpower!
        If not, how could we possibly understand?
        If one didn't understand it, one wouldn't be able to name it.
        In an instant, everyone understood each other's thoughts. Huang Long could not help but sneer,"The city of supers? A malignant tumor that's not much better than the three major organizations has come forward this time!"
        "Cough cough!"
        Someone coughed softly. A city that had gathered countless superpowers and was a righteous existence in the central region was naturally not that simple. Be careful not to cause any trouble.
       
        Everyone knew in their hearts who was the one standing behind them, but it was not appropriate to say anything.
        "It seems that Xu Qing's death will continue to ferment for a period of time. Let's wait and see. Those sixth level cultivators will jump out one by one. If they don't jump out ... They're probably afraid of being coveted by others."
        Someone laughed bitterly and shook his head helplessly. Someone else frowned and said,""Then ... What about the inspection Office?"
        That's right!
        If sixth-level cultivators had already jumped out from other places, what would the inspection Office do?
        As one of the nine divisions, if there was no existence at the sixth level, would there still be any dignity to speak of?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Could he still intimidate everyone?
        At this moment, a playful voice was heard,""To announce to the public that my father, the previous inspector, has attained the divine-tier state. Since the city of superpower has announced it, we shall continue to use this name!"
        Everyone was stunned!
        Your father?
         The first Secretary!
        "The old Secretary ... Is still alive?" someone asked.
        "Nonsense. Xu Qing's father is still alive. How can my father be dead?"
        “……”
        She was speechless.
        But very quickly, everyone's expression changed. If the first old Secretary was still alive, then ... What about the other eight divisions?
        What about the previous heavenly astral King?
        After the drastic change 80 years ago, these people were all influential figures. Back then, they were already 40 to 50 years old. Now that 80 years had passed, they were more than 100 years old.
        It might not be considered old in the ancient civilization.
        However, in this era ... It was too old!
        Be it superpowers or martial masters, the higher one's realm was, the more dangerous it would be. It was useless to have a strong body, but it was easy to explode with weak internal organs.
        How did these people manage to live to this point?
        Could it be ... That it had been growing with the spring of life?
        That would be too terrifying!
        As for the Secretary, he just sent this sentence and disappeared without even showing himself.
        Everyone didn't say anything else.
        At this moment, they were curious. What was the strength of their Secretary?
        Although he looked young, the Secretary was already around 70 years old. He had been a Secretary for 30 years, so he was definitely not weak.
        ……
        The aftermath was still spreading.
        The name of the sixth level also began to spread rapidly. The central continent was the first to know about it. When it spread to the North, the higher-ups naturally knew about it immediately. However, the people below might only know about it after a long time.
         Divine power!  The superpower City in the central region was given a name and explanation at once. It was a superpower that could destroy a city by itself.
        ……
        Silver Moon.
        Director Zhao looked at Huang Yu. Huang Yu thought for a while and nodded,""This name isn't too bad. It's obvious that the other party has made preparations. The fusion of five elements and two elements can indeed give birth to a special ability with great power ..."
        Director Zhao also nodded and smiled,""Also, the inspection Division has decided that Li Hao will be promoted, and the others ... Will be wanted!"
        "Arrest him then!" Huang Yu said indifferently. He sent out the arrest warrant and carried out the dynasty's orders! Whoever kills one of the five Devils will be rewarded with one hundred pieces of divine energy stone!"
        “……”
        Director Zhao looked at him and couldn't react. After a long while, he smiled,""Old Huang, you're ... Too much!"
        "A hundred Yuan is quite a lot."
        Huang Yu seemed to be as calm and serious as ever,""Silver Moon is too poor. Li Hao asked for 30000 before, so we don't have that much in stock. The higher-ups didn't mention anything about the reward, so we can't let them work for free. One hundred divine power stones can be exchanged for 100000 cubic meters of mysterious energy, or even countless star coins. Whoever kills one will instantly become rich ... That's enough!"
        Go to hell!
        Director Zhao cursed in his heart, but he didn't show it on his face. He was just joking.
        Of course, this wasn't too bad either.
        "That's it, then. Spread their photos ... Whoever kills one will be rewarded with 100 divine power stones. Silver Moon needs to maintain the dynasty's dominance!"
        "Understood!"
        The two of them looked at each other and nodded.
        At the side, Kong Jie, who was ignored, didn't say anything. She was thinking about something. When the two finished talking and saw that he didn't say anything, she was a little confused."Old Kong, what are you thinking about?"
        Kong Jie frowned,'I'm thinking ... Who's stronger now that the heavenly Sword has attained the divine power realm, or that we've completely unsealed ourselves? From the information we have, if we don't completely break the superpower lock after unsealing it ... We might not be able to defeat the divine power!"
        This was something that made him very unhappy!
        However, when the old Duke made his move, although the four experts did not fight with him, it was obvious that the old Duke had seen their strength and still dared to make a move. However, when he saw Tian Jian, he chose to retreat.
         This meant that ... The mystical power might be able to defeat the earth overturning sword and the others.
        Director Zhao laughed,"if you don't completely unseal it or completely break one of the locks ..... The chances are much lower!" However, he needed some time to completely break one of his five organs 'Super Lock ... Absorbing and digesting it was similar to using a god art. If you don't believe me, you can try now. If you break one, you might be able to step into the so-called divine power realm. "
        However, it would take time to absorb it.
        Xu Qing was almost there. He had completely broken one of the superpower locks. Of course, he did not dare to break two. It could easily cause his strength to soar and his body to explode.
        The inner strength of a Martial Master was too strong.
        Kong Jie was speechless. What nonsense.
        Go and try breaking it!
        I'm not doing it!
        "What is Tian Jian thinking?"
        Kong Jie still couldn't figure it out. After a long time, she shook her head."Forget it, I won't think about it! What I'm thinking now is, will Li Hao come back? If he comes back ... I'll have a headache. If he doesn't come back, I'll have a headache too. "
       
        What a troublemaker!
        If we make five powerhouses wanted today, we, Silver Moon, might even be wanted tomorrow.
        "All parties will soon send out their powerhouses of the sixth level. Regardless of whether they are in a stable state or not, they will be exposed first. Then, our Silver Moon ..." He frowned.
        "Heavenly Sword!"
        Director Zhao laughed,"he's the mountain chieftain of the heavenly Sword villa. Isn't he also from Silver Moon?" He's the one!"
        Kong Jie was completely speechless.
        'F * ck, there's such a thing?
        He rolled his eyes and continued,""Oh right, as for Yuan Shuo ... This time, he's reached the mastery of Five Forces. Do you think he'll be able to directly step into the next level? "Or ... Do you have to take this step like us, to saturated the superpower lock, then find a way to strengthen your five organs, and then think of a way to move forward ..."
        "Ask him. How do we know?"
        Director Zhao shook his head,"this time, there are so many Silver Moon martial masters, but the disadvantages are obvious. It's too troublesome to unseal a Martial Master!" Although martial Dao cultivation is more focused on strengthening one's body than superpowers ... If one can't break through this barrier ... The future of a Martial Master is still limited. "
         "The same goes for superpowers. They haven't solved this problem either."
        Kong Jie said,"the superpowers at this stage are most likely using treasures to sustain themselves. They might be using the spring of life, the blood God, or other treasures. I don't think there are many who can steadily reach the sixth level."
        "AI, let's see!"
        The few of them talked for a while and did not continue.
        As for the wanted document ... It was a joke, and they didn't care about it.
        ……
        On this day, news after news shook the entire superpower realm.
        Xu Qing was killed.
        Martial Master unsealing!
        Sixth level!
        All of this was enough to shock everyone.
        On this day, a piece of news that wasn't too eye-catching spread around some young people.
        The God tier Masters Ranking list was updated.
        The God tier masters list hadn't been updated for a long time, but it was updated today. The biggest change was that a few people were missing, and a few more people were added. The most eye-catching change was the addition of the name of devil sword Li Hao.
        This insignificant figure in the North had appeared on the God tier Masters Ranking list in the central continent.
        Moreover, the God tier Masters Ranking list only had superpowers.
        Today, there was an additional Martial Master.
        Li Hao!
        The God tier Masters Ranking was for the strongest and most famous powerhouses under the age of 30. It wasn't that there were no martial masters, but that no one under the age of 30 had ever been able to enter the ranking!
        In fact, there was more than one Li Hao. The God tier Masters Ranking also accepted demonic beasts.
        In the demon clan, any powerful demon who had awakened less than ten years ago, as long as they were famous and powerful, would also be recruited. This time, there was another powerful demon, a golden-furred Hound.
        Yes, it was black Panther.
        However, not many people knew the name of the Black Panther. It was not easy to determine what breed it was or what kind of demon it was. In the end, they gave it the name of a golden-furred Hound.
        Li Hao was ranked 27th on the God tier masters list.
        Yes, it was only 27.
        In his battle records, his strongest wasn't killing the red beard in the metamorphosis stage or general Huang, but Xu Zhen ... This was Li Hao's public battle record. As for killing the metamorphosis stage and escaping from Xu Qing, they weren't even included.
        Quite a number of people scoffed when they saw the rankings!
        What wild rankings!
        The demonic sword was only ranked 27th?
         The red-bearded man had died in a very aggrieved manner. General Huang and the others had also died in a very aggrieved manner.  However, the ranking list also explained that it only recorded true combat strength. Li Hao's battle in the North Sea might be the most real. He killed Xu Zhen with one sword strike. Judging from his strength, he was between the late stage and the peak stage of the rising light realm.
        This ranking was in line with Li Hao's strength.
        Of course, in terms of killing those in the metamorphosis stage ... That Li Hao was at least in the top three. As for the first place, it was not impossible to fight for it.
        As for Black Panther, his ranking was higher than Li Hao 's, 11th.
        His battle record was killing a late-stage sunrise expert and suppressing a peak-stage sunrise expert. That was also the result of the battle at the North Sea. In the end, the Black Panther devoured that peak-stage sunrise expert, but no one saw it and it was not recorded.
        However, his strength was recorded as peak sunrise.
        It was obvious that the top ten on this list all had the strength of a metahuman.
        At thirty years old, those who came into contact with supers early were the first batch of supers. At ten years old, they could become god tier Masters. In terms of qualifications, some of them were even tyrants.
        However, this list was only circulated in a small circle. The younger generation would only take a look. Other people would rarely take a look and would not take it seriously.
        Otherwise, if you believed in the rankings and treated Li Hao like an ordinary late-stage rising light ... You wouldn't even know how you died.
        The most important use of this list was to spread the name of Li Hao's demonic sword among the superpowers in the central continent. Almost all the superpowers in the central continent knew that there was a Martial Master expert who dominated the eastern and Northern continents.
        Before this, some news had only been spread among the higher-ups, and no one had wanted to make Li Hao famous.
        The God tier Masters Ranking list helped Li Hao become famous.
        ……
        "Interesting!"
        At this moment, someone in a Palace laughed.
        Ying Hongyue took a look at the list and chuckled."This is interesting. I feel like this list is imitating what an Overlord did in the ancient civilization ... They ranked the overlords and tested them step by step to stimulate them! It's only the younger generation and the central region, but it's already starting to include all directions. Next, it might expand ... In the end, all the strong people in the dynasty, even the entire world, will be included ... First, it'll build up its reputation, then slowly spread ..."
        On the side, Cheng Yue, who had just recovered from her injuries, was a little puzzled. She whispered,""Leader, do you mean that there is someone behind the God tier Masters?"
        "God tier master list ... Life and death list ..."
        Ying Hongyue smiled."Since ancient times, anyone who did this kind of thing and ranked the strong were either idiots or strong people! Moreover, he's a very evil-hearted powerhouse. Hahaha ... He's stirring up a storm! Even if you don't want to fight for it, as the Overlord of a force, how can you not fight for it?"
        "When Silver moon's list of heroes was released back then, don't you know how many people died?"
        He looked at orange moon and smiled radiantly,'how many people have died to get on this list? A General's success is built upon ten thousand bones. Who on the list doesn't have the wailing of dead souls under their hands?"
        Orange moon nodded and did not say anything else.
        However, he was confused ... Who made this god tier master ranking list?
        Even with Red moon's intelligence gathering ability, she couldn't find out.
        Ying Hongyue smiled and said,"I'm guessing ... That it's most likely the royal family. If it's not the royal family ... It means that there's another power that's rising and hiding. This intelligence system isn't bad."
        The royal family!
        "That's possible,"orange moon nodded after some thought.
         "Leader," he said,"Li Hao is getting stronger and stronger. So are Yuan Shuo and the others ... If this continues ..."
        Ying Hongyue's smile receded a little. A moment later, she slowly said,"Have the elder Council and the ancient divine guards move out. Find an opportunity to eliminate Li Hao!"
        "And you guys, it's time to work harder!"
        "Yes, I will."
        Ying Hongyue didn't say anything else. She stood up and walked inside as she said,"While Li Hao hasn't returned ... Go and get Ziyue back. Huang Yu and the others are still unwilling to completely fall out with us. Increase the price, ten drops of spring of life!"
        "Thank you, leader!" Orange moon's expression changed slightly as she quickly replied.
        "I should!"
        Ying Hongyue smiled and quickly disappeared.
        Orange moon did not say anything else and left quickly. The leader said that they had to take advantage of Li Hao's situation before he returned. She clearly knew that Li Hao's morale was high and he was fearless. Once he returned, he might kill Purple Moon.
