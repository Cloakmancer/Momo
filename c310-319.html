        It was a little round and looked like either a turtle shell or a hammer. It didn't look like a gun.
        "A hammer?"
        Li Hao also looked carefully for a while. Then, he asked curiously,""Teacher, you mean ..."
        "There might be ... Eight of these doors!"
        Yuan Shuo's eyes were strange,"they're all under the Silver City!" Of the eight stone doors, one should correspond to a sword, while the other should correspond to a saber. The eight doors, perhaps they will have to be opened together to successfully open the ruins. "
        Eight gates!
        "There are eight of these places?" Li Hao was shocked.
        "Yes, I originally thought that there was only one, but now it seems that's not the case. Otherwise, swords and sabers should be able to be placed inside, but not the other way around, so this stone gate is not the only one. Only when the eight gates converge or open at the same time can the true remains of the eight great families be opened!"
        "I'll go back and carefully study the map of the silver Blizzard city. Then, I'll secretly investigate. "
        Yuan Shuo laughed."Now ... Let's absorb some energy and leave quickly. This remains can't be opened, so we can seal it first. When the sword has run out of energy, we can absorb more. I don't think much has seeped out."
         "Teacher, why don't I let out some blood first ..."
        "Hehe!"
        "Come on," Yuan Shuo sneered,"do you really think you're the only heir? You've just lost your blood, so there's a reaction. It's already started a long time ago. This place is 99% opened by the combination of the eight weapons. "
        Eight gates!
        Li Hao's eyes suddenly twitched."Teacher, in that case, if the Qiao family doesn't excavate the other places, even if we can't open them, won't we be able to get a lot of benefits?"
        "The probability is!"
        Yuan Shuo laughed as well, but it was an unusual laugh.
        Perhaps, he was going to make a fortune next.
        He didn't have a lot of wealth, but he definitely had a lot of small wealth.
        Of course, the premise was that they could find the other seven stone doors. This was only speculation at the moment.
        "Hehe ..."
        The master and disciple laughed at the same time. It didn't matter if this place couldn't be opened. If they could really find the other seven places, they might have unexpected gains.
        Qiao Feilong was able to become one of the three suns and even nurtured three sunlit experts.
        "We found seven places ... Can we cultivate seven three suns and 21 sunlit Warriors?
        Damn, he could even start a war with the night patrolmen of Silvermoon province.
        "Quickly absorb it. We'll leave after we're done. There have been a lot of people paying attention to us recently. I'll just seal this place off in case they find out anything."
        "Alright!"  Li Hao took out the small sword and began to use the five animals breathing technique. Yuan Shuo did the same, first absorbing some energy and bringing it away.
        As for taking the mixed energy away, Li Hao had yet to find a good way to do so. He had yet to find a carrier. He could think about it later. This thing, when combined with the red shadow energy, was also a great weapon.
        ……
        After a long time, Li Hao couldn't absorb any more energy, and the energy seemed to have run out. It was overflowing little by little, not enough to absorb.
        The master and disciple duo chose not to absorb anymore.
        Yuan Shuo led Li Hao out of the hall. He punched out, and a huge rock fell to the ground. Yuan Shuo picked it up and sealed the iron gate.
        However, it would be difficult to avoid the detection of some people.
        Yuan Shuo looked at it for a while and gritted his teeth."I'll blow up the entire area when I get back. I'll make the entire mountain collapse."
        "Teacher, this is too big of a commotion. It's not good, right?"
        "That's true ... Forget it, I'll think of a way later. Otherwise, I'll be easily exposed. Even if I'm really exposed, no one can open it."
        The two of them did not feel any reluctance and quickly left the mine with Black Panther.
        Li Hao took one last look back. This place ... Was definitely still his.
        No one could snatch it away!
        He was actually curious about what was behind the door. From the engravings, the swordsman might have entered behind the door ... Was it this embossed door?
        Unfortunately, he had no way and no strength to explore it.
        "Red Moon, six of the Eight Families 'weapons might be with them."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Thinking of this, Li Hao's hatred grew.
        Putting aside the fact that he wanted to kill me, he even stole my clan's treasures ... The eight clans are one, and with the other clans gone, the treasures of the eight clans will naturally be his.
        Hong Yue had robbed the other families of their treasures, which meant that she had robbed him.
        Li Hao felt even more resentful at this thought.
        I'll kill you all sooner or later!
        Yuan Shuo saw that he was gritting his teeth and thought that he was unwilling to give up. He felt a little helpless. This kid, why did he become greedy again at this time?
        You've broken through a hundred perfections tonight, isn't that enough?
        What an insatiable brat!
        But ... I like it!
        [Author's note: just three chapters left, about 29000 or less. Less than 30000. I can't write anymore. I'll continue tomorrow.]
       
        Walking out of the mine, the two people and one dog felt as if it had been a lifetime.
        They had only gone down for a short while, but they had experienced a lot, especially Li Hao, who had seen the scene that had been transmitted to them since God knows when. It instantly broadened their horizons.
        Hu Hao and Chen Jian were still outside the mine.
        They didn't know that Li Hao and Yuan Shuo had made great progress in just a few hours.
        It was already three in the morning.
        When Hu Hao saw them coming out, he immediately said,""Master ... Yuan, this dog just barged in by itself. I think I saw it following you and Li Hao before, so I didn't ..."
        Yuan Shuo waved his hand.
        He had already entered, so there was nothing to be conflicted about.
        The Black Panther wagged its tail in a fawning manner. It was quite afraid of Yuan Shuo.
        "We can evacuate from here."
         Yuan Shuo said. The two of them were a little surprised. Hu Hao knew what the remains meant. They probably wouldn't get anything in a few hours.
        They're retreating just like that?
        "Teacher Yuan, you're not ... Exploring anymore?"
        Yuan Shuo smiled."The Qiao family took almost everything. Now, there's nothing left. Even if there are still some unexplored places, they're not places we can explore now. Maybe we can try again in a few years."
        Unable to explore?
        Hu Hao understood.
        Such situations were not unheard of. For example, the ruins that they were going to explore next had been put on hold because of their strength.
        This was not a rare situation.
        However, this also meant that the underground remains were not ordinary.
        If Qiao Feilong could step into the three suns realm, he would know how many good things they had taken had been digested into their power.
        "Professor Yuan, we're not going to do anything then?"
        Chen Jian could not help but scratch his head."Isn't this ... Too much of a pity?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A relic!
        Unlike supers who had explored some ruins before, he had never explored them before. He had only heard of them and knew that there were treasures in them.
        However, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo were-handed ... It seemed that they didn't gain anything.
        Wouldn't it be a pity to give up on the exploration?
        "It's not a pity," Li Hao explained softly."It's useless to continue exploring now. It'll be the same if we come back when we have the strength."
        "I'm just afraid that someone else will find me ..."
        "I'm fine. "
        Li Hao laughed,"brother Chen, even my teacher can't do anything about it. How can you count on others?" Of course, if it's above three yang, then it's a different story. There might be a way, but if an expert of that level comes and forces it, we can't do anything. "
        It seemed to make sense!
        This time, Chen Jian and Hu Hao no longer said anything.
        The remains were Li Hao's and Yuan Shuo's spoils of war. Since the two of them felt that there was no need to continue, there was naturally no need to say anything.
        If there was no need to defend, they could retreat.
        "We didn't drive here, why don't I fly everyone back ..." Hu Hao said.
         "There are too many people. Forget it, it's too troublesome."  Yuan Shuo waved his hand."You can take this fatty and fly back. Li Hao and I will do the same thing. We'll run back."
        Flying also consumed mysterious energy. Hu Hao was tired enough carrying Chen Jian, but Chen Jian was even more tired than Yuan Shuo and Li Hao combined.
        ……
        They exchanged a few simple words.
        Li Hao and Yuan Shuo ran back just like they had come.
        This time, there was a Black Panther.
        In the wilderness.
        The two people and one dog started to run again.
        Like an elk, it once again galloped and jumped.
        But this time, Li Hao could feel that he was running faster and faster, even faster than before.
        Breaking through 100 ... He could be considered to have barely stepped into this level.
        Now, what he lacked was to combine his inner strength and force to form a sword and complete the final integration.
        Of course, it might not be a sword.
        Both offensive and defensive.
        The sword wasn't bad, but if it could connect to the earth, it wouldn't be bad either. Li Hao was no longer in a hurry.
        He was barely able to step into the thousand warrior realm, but he might only be able to reach the same level as his Captain.
        And if the sword and the earth were connected successfully, perhaps he could be like his teacher.
        One of them could kill three suns, while the other could only deal with the early stage of the sunlit realm ... The gap was still huge.
        It was good to have a high realm.
        However, Li Hao did not like the fact that his combat ability was too weak even though his level was high. He had to at least reach the middle level. For example, if he entered the universe, even if he could not kill three suns like his teacher, he should have no problem dealing with an ordinary peak solar glory cultivator, right?
        ……
        While running, Li Hao felt the power of the earth.
        He closed his eyes. At this moment, he no longer relied on his eyes to see the road. Instead, he relied on his senses and that weak power of perception.
        At the Qian dynasty, martial masters had power.
         At that time, he would be able to sense everything around him even with his eyes closed. This was what Li Hao needed to learn next.
        He had improved too quickly, causing him to be lacking in many things.
        Also, what would happen to his five birds technique if he were to cross over to the warrior dimension?
        Without the momentum of the five birds technique, the power of the five birds technique would be greatly reduced. It definitely couldn't compare to his teacher 's, which was 100%.
        Even if the nine-refinements force could be stacked nine times, if it did not match the force ...
        ,m Nine-fold sword-swinging?  Li Hao thought of this while he was running.
        Five birds technique, force of earth, sword intent, and nine refined force. Could these few forces and secret techniques be combined?
        The five birds technique was also something that his teacher had studied bit by bit before finally completing the fusion of the momentum of the five birds. This was also an extremely powerful point. Could he try to do this in the future?
        Too many thoughts appeared in his mind.
       
        Before he knew it, Li Hao had already reached the Urban area.
        It was still early, but some people Urban area had already gone out early. There was a burst of noise from the vegetable market, and a burst of fragrance came from the breakfast shops. At this time, the city had begun to recover.
        ……
        At the inspection Office.
        Liu Long listened to Chen Jian's report and nodded slightly.
        He didn't ask much about the remains.
        However, Chen Jian and Hu Hao's return meant that the remains could not be developed for the time being. Liu Long felt a little regretful. At this time, whether it was Yuan Shuo or Li Hao, if they could obtain the treasures of the remains and improve their strength, it would be a good thing for him.
        "Since elder Yuan said we don't need to care, then we won 't!"
        Liu Long said. He looked at Chen Jian and said,"Are you sure you don't want to try to become a super again and choose to break through 100?"
        Chen Jian hesitated for a moment, but he quickly nodded firmly."Mm! Superpowers, I have never found an ability that is compatible with me. I thought I was good at Earth Defense and tried to absorb earth energy, but I have never succeeded. I'm actually a little worried. I've been focusing on defense, so if I suddenly obtain some healing ability ... I won't be used to it. "
         "Besides, martial masters aren't weak!“
        "Elder Yuan has a thousand slashes three suns, and boss, you have a thousand slashes sunlight. Since a Martial Master has a future, why don't you take it?"
        "When I reach the later stage, I won't be able to reach the universe of thousands. However, I can still become a super if I break through 100. I just need to consume more mysterious energy."
        At this point, Chen Jian could not help but laugh."Boss, I've realized that the speed at which we can obtain mysterious energy is more than a hundred times faster than before! If I stay in the tenth realm, I won't be able to participate in the next battle. How can I divide the mysterious energy?"
        The team's strength was much stronger than before.
        And now, only he and Wu Chao were still stuck at the ten slash realm.
        In the past, they had thought that this was sufficient, but now they realized that ... If this continued, they would be eliminated.
        "As long as you're willing, martial masters ... Aren't weak!" Liu Long nodded.
        After he entered the universe, he had a deep feeling: "I may not be as strong as elder Yuan, but the battle with riyao earlier, regardless of whether he was a newbie or not, proved one thing. When a Martial Master of the same level reaches the battle of chimeras, no matter what ability the opponent has, he will not be at a disadvantage."
        Before the battle of thousands, the martial masters were at a disadvantage mainly because of the special abilities of supers.
        Some of them could fly, while others could burrow through the ground. When faced with these supers, martial masters could only take a beating, but it did not mean that all martial masters with over a hundred abilities were inferior to Yue Ming.
        Chen Jian also hurriedly nodded.
        "Boss, then I'll take the blood God. I wonder if I'll really be able to break through the 100th level after taking it ..."
        "It's not a big problem,"
        Liu Long had also asked Wang Ming before, but then he said,"Elder Yuan said that if you want to take the blood God, you can wait a few days. There's no rush."
        "Oh, that's good!"
        Chen Jian did not ask much. After a few simple greetings, they went their separate ways. They were used to living in the law enforcement building, and this habit had not changed until now, so even in the middle of the night, they could meet and talk at any time.
        ……
        As usual, Li Hao didn't ride his worn-out bicycle to the inspection Office until it was time for work.
        He wasn't pretending to be poor, he really didn't have a car to drive.
         His teacher's car was gone, and his own car was broken. The inspection Office wouldn't lend him a car, so he could only use his own bicycle.  The car had just stopped at the entrance of the patrol office.
        Li Hao heard someone calling his name. He knew who it was from the voice.
        "Li Hao!"
        A slightly bold voice came from behind.
        Seeing Li Hao turn around, the valiant Chen Na complained,""Great, you've been promoted and made a fortune, so you've forgotten about your old friend!"
        Li Hao smiled when he saw Chen Na.
        "Sister na, when did I forget about my old friend?"
        "You still say you didn 't?"
        Chen Na actually knew some things. After all, the night patrollers were no longer a secret to the inspector.
        After the establishment of the Silver City branch, the night patrollers were almost half-public in the inspection Office.
        She even knew that Li Hao seemed to have become an official and a leader among the night patrols, but ... So what?
        "Didn't you say that you were recruiting people to do logistics? You can get a promotion, a raise in your salary, and you can even see big scenes. Why didn't you come to me?"
        "I'm free in the confidential room ..."
        "Tsk!"
        Chen Na rolled her eyes at him, but she quickly laughed and said,"That little Ming, I heard he's a leader in your Department? Captain Liu is the leader, and you and little Ming are the deputies?"
        "Sister na is well-informed."
        Li Hao smiled and followed Chen Na.
        He had been in contact with the Martial Master every day. Even though he had not seen Chen Na for a few days, he had a different feeling when he saw an ordinary person.
        Thinking back to the one year in the confidential room, he actually felt that it was quite good.
         Now, no one would help him find a partner when he entered the house.
        He had felt annoyed before, but now he missed her.
        Humans were really complicated.
        They chatted for a while. They didn't work in the same office building, so Chen Na only chatted for a while. She didn't really want Li Hao to help her with her promotion. Then, they parted ways at the fork in the road.
        Li Hao strode into the law enforcement building.
        He didn't go to his own office but went straight to Liu Yan 's.
        ……
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "A rare guest has arrived!"
        Liu Yan seemed to have just finished her training. She was only wearing a small tank top, which highlighted her figure even more.
        However, the only thing that was a little unsightly was that his hands were a little scorched.
       
        It had only been a day since the battle.
        Previously, with Hao lianchuan around and his insufficient sword energy, Li Hao was not in a hurry to treat Liu Yan. Of course, the main reason was that Liu Yan did not show any signs of pain.
        But now, Jiao ku's hands seemed to be cracked. On closer look, some bones could even be seen, which was the result of yunyao's treatment.
        Clearly, Liu Yan's injuries weren't as light as she had made them out to be.
        Li Hao furrowed his brows slightly, and su Zhan quickly said,""Sister, didn't the higher-ups reward you with a pill? If you consume it now, I'll use my special inner strength to help you dissolve it. The injury on your hand should be able to recover, and you might even be able to advance to the middle stage of the breakthrough 100 realm. "
        "Special inner strength?" Liu Yan asked with a faint smile.
        Li Hao also grinned."Yes, my teacher taught me. It's very powerful!"
        "How powerful is he?"
        Liu Yan winked at Li Hao. Li Hao was speechless. Sure enough, he was no match for a 30-year-old woman when it came to talking about such things.
        Her hands were almost gone, yet she still had the mood to make eyes.
         Liu Yan teased Li Hao for a while, then stopped teasing him. Without changing her clothes, she directly walked towards Li Hao and approached him, saying,""Little Haohao, thank you for your hard work. Help me treat my hands. When my hands are better, I'll give you a massage to reward you ..."
        Come on!
        I don't want that.
        Li Hao didn't argue with her. He gave her a few words of advice and told her how to digest the energy of the blood God. Li Hao used the five birds breathing technique to absorb a little sword energy and began to help Liu Yan digest the energy of the blood God and heal her hands.
        Because hou Xiaochen had refined the blood God's energy into a pill, he could actually digest it without sword energy.
        However, the speed was very slow, the efficiency was very low, and the waste was very serious.
        A Dark Moon grade blood deity was actually not enough for Liu Yan to advance to the middle stage of the 100th level, as most of the effects would be wasted. However, if sword energy was added to it, the blood deity could be used to its greatest extent.
        This was also the reason why Yuan Shuo and Li Hao told them not to take the blood God's pellets in a hurry.
        It was better to be as strong as possible.
        As for the sword energy, they all knew of its existence.
        Sometimes, Li Hao was open-minded. Some secrets had to be kept a secret, but some secrets were already known to everyone, so he didn't bother to cover them up. The special inner strength was just an excuse.
        In the office, Liu Yan's face was flushed.
        The first time he absorbed the power of the red shadow, it was still very powerful.
        Coupled with the fact that the injuries on her hands were healing rapidly, Liu Yan could not help but let out a few groans.
        At first, Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it. When he and his teacher used it for the first time, it had also been called out.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, he had forgotten that he was in the law enforcement building and in Liu Yan's office.
        ……
        Outside the office.
        Wang Ming's ears perked up, and he pretended to pass by inadvertently.
        After a while, Hu Hao and Li Meng were talking in low voices, holding a folder in their hands. They seemed to be working and happened to pass by.
        A moment later, Wu Chao and Chen Jian paced back and forth outside the office, as if they were about to report on work.
        After a while, even yunyao, wearing that special pair of glasses, came over.
        After a while, Liu Long, who was wearing a windbreaker, walked over and scolded in a low voice,""You're free to work?"
        Wu Chao winked at the office and said in a low voice,"Boss, you've been poached! It's broad daylight ... Captain Liu and division li are too much!"
        "Go to hell!"
        Liu Long cursed. "You're the one who's been poached."  However, it was still broad daylight ...
        Also, Li Hao was too ... Too much.
        He was too embarrassed to sense it.
        Can the two of you be more mindful of your image?
        They were doing that in the office, and everyone was listening. Even Liu Long felt embarrassed for them.
        Shameless!
        When Wang Ming passed by again, he couldn't help the gossipy look in his eyes. With some excitement, he whispered,"Department Liu, do we ban office romance? Also, is Li Hao abusing his power for personal gain?"
        Liu Long was speechless.
        You supers, are you all so gossipy?
        All of you, are you too free?
        As he said that, Liu Long suddenly jumped away. At this time, the office door was opened.
        In the distance, Liu Long seemed to have just arrived. He berated,"What are you all doing here? Aren't you busy?"
        Li Hao, who opened the door, was speechless.
        Do you think I didn't sense that you were there just now?
        He didn't expect that the cold, arrogant, and wild commander Liu would learn to do this.
        Behind them, Liu Yan's face was flushed and she was wearing a small tank top. She stretched her head to look at the others and smiled. "Everyone's here?"
        “……”
        Silence.
        "Shameless!" Yunyao couldn't help but curse.
        Li Hao could only roll his eyes. Without explaining anything, he said,""Brother Chen, brother Wu, come in!"
        "We?"
        The two of them looked at each other, feeling a little guilty.
        Why?
        We didn't say anything.
        ,m Wu Chao felt even guiltier. He had just said that Li Hao was trying to steal someone's girlfriend. He wouldn't make things difficult for him, would he?   "Come in! My words as a Deputy Minister are of no use?"
        The two of them dawdled and somewhat unwillingly cast a few pleading looks at Liu Long, but Liu Long's face remained indifferent, as if he didn't see them, not caring at all.
        With that, the two of them entered the office helplessly in despair.
        The door was closed with a bang.
        Wang Ming and the others looked at each other. What was this?
        After a while ...
        "Ah!"
        The moans sounded again.
        It was Chen Jian's voice.
        Wang Ming's eyes widened. He couldn't help looking at Liu Long, then at yunyao, a little shocked. What was going on?
       
        Was the demon hunting squad so chaotic in the past?
        First, it was Li Hao and Liu Yan, then Chen Jian ... And then there's also Wu Chao. Should I call them later?
        Liu Long's expression changed, and after a long while, he said, "He's cultivating!"
        "Oh, oh!"
        Wang Ming hurriedly nodded, but ... Who would believe him?
        In any case, he had never used such a name when he was cultivating. He had never seen anyone using such a name when cultivating. Who was he trying to fool?
        There were screams!
        The cultivation of the mysterious energy was still very painful. Sometimes, it was like being cut by a knife. He often heard screams of pain from the impact of the mysterious energy, but this was obviously not the case. Once he heard it, it was a cry of pleasure, okay?
        Oh my God!
        It was simply an eyesore that destroyed his three views.
         The three supers who had just joined looked at each other. Could this be the key to the unity of the demon-hunting teams?
        At this moment, the three of them even subconsciously moved away from Liu Long and Yun Yao.
        Yun Yao and Liu Long were also speechless.
        However, the two of them were probably really cultivating. Previously, Liu Yan and Li Hao were alone, so something might have happened. Now that Chen Jian and Wu Chao were also inside, it was obvious that they were not doing anything they shouldn't be doing.
        When he thought of this, he thought of the blood God ...
        At this moment, Liu Long's eyes were filled with anticipation.
        Could it be that ... Li Hao or Yuan Shuo had a way to make it easier for them to absorb the blood God?
        The few people who went in all had clones of the blood God.
        And they were all martial masters!
        And the look of anticipation in his eyes made Wang Ming's scalp tingle. Li Meng also moved closer to him and said in an almost inaudible voice,"Brother Wang, the look in Minister Liu's eyes ... Does he want to go in too?"
        Wang Ming nodded indiscernibly. It was obvious!
        How terrifying!
        Not far away, Liu Long's ears quivered.
        Do these two think I can't hear you?
        Forget it, I can't be bothered to argue with them.
        He continued to wait.
        Liu Long was filled with anticipation.
        If Wu Chao and Chen Jian had also advanced, then this team, which only had one member who had broken through the 100-point mark a few days ago, would most likely have all broken through the 100-point Dark Moon realm today. As the leader, he had even broken through to the thousand warrior realm.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Although there were only a few people in the team, one warrior of the thousand-star level and eight of them were powerful forces.
        The Silver City's defensive power would reach a new peak.
        The wait was torturous.
        Wang Ming and the others didn't leave either. At first, they were full of curiosity, but gradually, they realized that something wasn't right.
        Wang Ming's eyes flickered for a moment before he looked at Liu Long and said in a low voice,"Minister Liu, what's going on inside?"  Liu Long said calmly,"our team has a special cultivation method. We cultivate in the most comfortable way. It's a unique secret. Usually, when we reach a bottleneck, we can break through after cultivating for a while!" I think Wu Chao and Chen Jian can both break through 100 this time. "
        "Why would I?"
        Wang Ming was taken aback, and then he thought of the blood God ... But he'd also taken the blood God, and although the effects weren't bad, the one Wu Chao and the others had gotten was about the same as the one he'd gotten at the time. The effects wouldn't be so quick, would they?
        Besides, he didn't cry out when he ate the blood God's spawn.
        Without the assistance of a sword, the blood God's clone wasn't that comfortable. It didn't taste very good, and it had to endure the explosive power of the blood shadow.
        He suspected that Liu Long was lying to him!
        However, after waiting for almost an hour, the office door was opened again.
        At this moment, both Wu Chao and Chen Jian's faces were flushed, as if they were extremely excited.
        Chen Jian was sweating profusely, but he did not care about this. He looked at Liu Long and waved his fist excitedly. A faint inner strength overflowed from his fist.
        "Boss!"
        "I've broken through 100!"Chen Jian was excited.
        In the past, if everyone had broken through 100, they might have been a little depressed, not knowing whether to be happy or sad.
        However, now that Liu Long had also stepped into the universe master level, their desire for superpowers had suddenly been greatly extinguished.
        Breaking through 100 points was also a major breakthrough.
        "Me too!" Wu Chao also smiled faintly.
        Behind them, Liu Yan had changed into the patrol uniform, which covered her good figure. She smiled faintly and said, "I've also improved a little. I can release the force in my limbs. I haven't reached the middle stage of breaking through 100, but I'm close. "
        Both Wu Chao and Chen Jian had just learned to release their inner strength, but she had made further progress and was only one step away from the middle stage.
        Wang Ming and the others were completely stunned!
        It was true!
        These guys had really advanced.
        "So ... All of the night patrollers in Blizzard Silver City have broken the 100-point Dark Moon mark?" Hu Hao suddenly asked.
        "Li Hao, he ..."
         Wang Ming was about to say no when Li Hao said shyly,""Old Wang, I also just advanced last night."
        “……”
        Silence.
        Wang Ming's eyes went wide. He looked at Liu Long and the others and was a little stunned. After a long while, he said,"All members ... Have advanced!"
        One douqian and eight moon nether cultivators broke through 100.
        Such strength had surpassed the other branches of the night patrollers. Now, they were only second to the night patrollers of Whitemoon city and yaoguang city.
        Yaoguang city was the second largest city. There were several sunlit cities and dozens of dark moons there, which was slightly stronger than Silver City.
        However, the other few places were usually guarded by a sunlit expert, a few Dark Moon experts, and a few Starlight Masters.
        Some of the weaker ones didn't even have sunlight.
        Originally, the Silver City branch had just been established and was the weakest. However, in the blink of an eye, it had become the third-ranked night patrolman branch in Silver Moon province. With the addition of that supernumerary Yuan Shuo, the existence that could kill the three suns ...
       
        The headquarters was probably the only one who could put up a fight.
        "Let me slowly ..."
        Wang Ming couldn't quite accept it and said incredulously, "That's impossible. I know about the blood God. It's very helpful for martial masters to enter the tenth severing realm, or to improve the tenth severing realm, but ... But the effect can't be that good, right?"
        This was great!
        Li Hao laughed."Of course. But have you forgotten who my teacher is?" A master of martial arts, with a little bit of a special method, it's naturally extraordinary. "
        "Not only that," Li Hao said enticingly,"if we can get more clones of the blood God, it's not completely useless for superpowers ..."
        "What?"
        "Even superpowers work?" Wang Ming was instantly shocked.
        "Right!"
        Li Hao smiled."Superpowers absorb mysterious energy to strengthen themselves. However, the mysterious energy can be used in conjunction with Blood God's clone. With my teacher's Secret technique, it'll be useful too!" For example, brother Wang, you're good at metal-type energy. With some metal-type energy, Blood God, and some other things, you'll be able to absorb metal-type energy faster and stronger. I think you'll be able to enter the full moon level or even the sun glory level very soon!"
         Wang Ming's eyes instantly shone!
        Is that true?
        Li Meng and Hu Hao were also slightly moved. Hu Hao couldn't help but ask,""That ... I ... I'm a fairy ..." He said.
        "This is related to the wind element. You usually absorb wind energy, right?"
        Hu Hao nodded. The soaring system was actually related to the wind system, but it was a variant. Not all wind systems could fly in the sky at first.
        "What about me?" Li Meng asked anxiously. My third eye is actually the hardest to improve. If I could absorb mysterious energy at will, I would have advanced a long time ago. However, I can only absorb some attribute-less mysterious energy to strengthen myself, so it doesn't really match ..."
        At that moment, the three supers could not sit still.
        He watched helplessly as the martial masters in front of him improved rapidly while they remained in the same spot! It was said that it was harder for! Martial Master to advance in rank than it was for a superpower! But why did he suddenly feel that it was harder for a superpower to advance in rank while it was easier for! Martial Master!
        At this moment, Liu Long spoke,"alright, there are no more blood God clones. Everyone, don't think too much about it!" Today, Wu Chao and Chen Jian both advanced ... Oh, and Li Hao too. "
        He knew that Li Hao had advanced a long time ago.
        However, since this kid insisted on talking about last night, he couldn't be bothered to expose him.
        "This is great news. In addition to the destruction of the Qiao family, Liu Yan's revenge has been taken ... We'll get back the remaining half sooner or later!"
        As he spoke, Liu Long revealed a rare smile, "It's my treat tonight!"
        Everyone also smiled.
        Li Hao was just about to speak when Liu Long said,""Just eat at Li Hao's house. That way, we won't have to go out. Also, Li Hao, remember to order!"
        “……”
        Li Hao was speechless.
        You really have had enough!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com You're still treating?
        This is considered a treat?
         The captain was becoming less and less human.  Liu Long chuckled and ignored him. He walked away in an extremely good mood.
        In fact, it was even better than entering the warrior dimension.
        Not only did no one in the team die recently, but everyone had also improved. This was great.
        Seeing that he had left, Li Hao didn't say anything. He walked toward Yun Yao. Ever since this doctor became a water super, he seemed to be in low spirits.
        ……
        Yun Yao, on the other hand, was calm.
        "Congratulations!" He smiled when he saw Li Hao walking over.
        "Sister Yun, can you shrink your glasses a little?"
        Li Hao didn't rush to say anything else. Instead, he talked about the glasses.
        "I've been testing it recently. "
        Yunyao nodded."It's possible to shrink it, but I can still see some things. It's still very weak. I want to adjust it again. It's best if I can see it more clearly."
        "Sister Yun, can you give me a pair after you're done?"
        "You want this?"
        Li Hao nodded.
        In fact, it was not him who wanted it, but his teacher. His teacher had some plans and was prepared to hunt down the Crimson Moon experts. However, he could not see the Red Shadows, but he could sense a little, but it was not clear.
        If he wore the glasses, he would be able to see the red dot. With his perception, the red shadow would not be able to hide from his teacher!
        Yun Yao's glasses were extremely important.
        No one actually paid much attention to it right now. If it was handed over to the higher-ups, especially someone like hou Xiaochen, they would definitely pay attention to it if they knew about Hong Yue's situation. The red shadow's strength lay in its secrecy.
        If everyone had such glasses, they would be able to see the red dot, and the concealment would be greatly reduced.
         "Sister Yun, I'm afraid that if you hand these glasses over to the higher-ups ..."
        Yunyao didn't wait for him to finish and interrupted,""Not for the time being, it hasn't been completely adjusted yet. I know what you're trying to say ..."
        Speaking of this, yunyao suddenly laughed contemptuously,""But even if I do send it up, I'm not sure if it can be used to deal with the Crimson Moon. Instead, I might be exposed in advance and let the Crimson Moon know."
        Li Hao was stunned.
        Yunyao said softly,"you have to know that the night patrolmen are not actually a piece of iron. It's still fine in Silvermoon province. In some areas, some of the night patrolmen's provincial branches have even been divided!" The Crimson Moon's strength in Silver Moon isn't too great, so it doesn't really make much of a difference whether we have this or not. The truly useful place is actually the place where the Crimson Moon powerhouses are abundant ... But that place is also the most chaotic. Little Hao, sometimes, it's just a good thing if you don't have something good to contribute. "
        "Also, are you sure no one else can find that thing?"
        Li Hao fell into deep thought.
        Didn't he?
        There were!
        Because he knew that someone who could see the red shadow had been taken away by the night patrol.
       
        Where did those people go?
        Why can I see it?
        As expected, he knew too little. Yunyao, on the other hand, seemed to know more.
        Liu Long had said that every member of a demon-hunting team had their own story, but no one would ask unless someone else was willing to tell them. For example, Li Hao knew about Liu Yan's situation.
        Yunyao, what's the story?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I'll get you a pair when I'm done ..."
        Yun Yao didn't say much. If Li Hao wanted it, she wouldn't refuse.
        "Elder sister Yun, when we get some good stuff later, I'll ask my teacher to help you level up ..." Li Hao nodded and said.
        "It's fine, there's no rush. "
        Yun Yao smiled gently."I'm a doctor. It's okay if I'm weak."
         Li Hao didn't say anything else.
        He hoped that the entire team could become stronger.
        The Silver City was also his hometown. There were many secrets here, and it would attract a group of experts sooner or later.
        The night patrolman's intention had not changed even now. He might still want to give up Silver City and defend the big city.
        From the fact that Hao lianchuan and the others were so focused on exploring the ruins that they could put aside everything else, it could be seen that they valued that defensive origin divine weapon. Teacher said that it might be the Wang family's turtle shell.
        Was the Wang family's turtle shell not in Hong Yue's hands?
        Li Hao was also confused about this.
        How many weapons did Red Moon take away?
        ……
        While he was thinking, someone suddenly put his arm around Li Hao's shoulder. Wang Ming put his arm around Li Hao affectionately and grinned from ear to ear."Li Hao, we're fellow disciples, did you know that?"
        “……”
        Li Hao was speechless.
        I know. I just found out yesterday. Also, I'm actually your senior brother.
        "Next time, remember to call me along if you have any benefits. We're all on the same side. In fact, we're even closer than you are to the demon hunting squad!"
        Wang Ming started to pull strings with a bright smile. "I'll think of a way to see if I can get some blood deities from the White moon City ... Can you really help me advance?"
        "It's hard to say. You're powerful. One dark Moon pill might not be enough."
        Wang Ming frowned slightly. That was true.
        "Those ... Those two?"
        "Maybe I can."
        Wang Ming was at a loss; it wasn't easy.
        That thing was mainly used to train new people.
        "Do you know the origin of this thing?" Li Hao asked softly.
        "I don't know,"
        "I know,"
        Li Hao said softly,"teacher also knows. Teacher said that this is a special product carried by the red moon organization's Dark Moon-level supers. You should have felt it last time. It's the invisible object that injured the Minister. It was extracted through a special method ..."
        Wang Ming's expression instantly changed. At first, it was aghast, and then it was bright.
        The Crimson Moon!
        Li Hao continued."Every time you kill a moon nether, you can get one and make it into a Blood God. That's the origin of the blood God!"
        "Hiss!"  Wang Ming took a deep breath, and after that, he swallowed a little."Really?"
        "It's 100% true. We're all fellow disciples, so why Would I Lie to You?"
        "Then ... Then if I kill two of them, I'll have a chance to advance to full moon?"
        "Yes, the premise is that there must be someone to help you extract it. Only teacher can do it, and I can 't. So if you have any ideas, it's best if you work with us. Not everyone can extract this thing. In the entire Silver Moon province, only teacher and Minister hou can do it."
        "I see!"
        "Teacher is really a pedantic man!" Wang Ming exclaimed.
        He suddenly felt that it was worth it to be Yuan Shuo's in-name disciple.
        That's great!
        At this moment, he suddenly gritted his teeth."The Crimson Moon ... An evil organization like this should be eradicated! The next time we encounter Red moon's people, kill them directly!"
        Li Hao smiled.
        That's right. Even if everyone was willing to fight Red Moon for him, there might still be some differences in the end.
        But what if it was for everyone's improvement?
        Wasn't it only right to kill the red moon's people?
        This was a win-win situation!
        Li Hao said in a low voice,"so, you're well-informed. Help us find out more about the stronghold of the Crimson Moon, and where the experts of the Crimson Moon are. We're only from the Silver City, so it's hard for us to find out. Don't you have any connections in the White moon City?"
        "Of course!"
        "Leave this to me!" Wang Ming said excitedly. Don't worry. "I say, Li Hao, don't think that I only know how to take advantage of others. In Whitemoon city, I, Wang Ming, have the title of a genius, but that's just one of the reasons. Second, my Wang family can be considered powerful and influential. Without power and influence, it's hard to obtain enough mysteries to quickly advance."
        "Let me put it this way. Some of the elders in my family don't hold positions among the Nightwatchers, but my Wang family is mainly rooted in the Silver Moon Army ... Li Hao, we're fellow disciples, so let's not talk about family matters. When we reach white moon City in the future, I'll mobilize an Army of less than a thousand men for you at any time ..."
        Li Hao frowned slightly,'that works? It's so chaotic?"
        Private mobilization of the Army!
        Wang Ming pursed his lips,"after the rise of superpowers, all the places were in chaos!" What do you think? Silver moon's doing well, at least he's listening to the Central's orders. However, Silver moon's internal structure is somewhat divided, but it's still a good thing that everyone's working together to resist a powerful enemy. "
        "Of course," he said,"I can only send less than a thousand people. I don't have the ability to send more than that."
        It was already very awesome!
        Li Hao could imagine that the Wang family's power was probably not weak, and they had a high-level position in the garrison. Otherwise, Wang Ming wouldn't have the right to mobilize the garrison.
        How many troops does Silver Moon have?"
        "Around 300000, not too much."
        Wang Ming explained."Besides the night watchers, there are also some supers in the garrison, the inspection Division, and the administration Bureau. But the night watchers make up the majority, even more than the garrison. That's why the night watchers are the only superpower organization in the government."
        Li Hao nodded. He knew something else.
         And this cheap Junior Brother might really need his help in the future.
        The garrison seemed to be powerless in the face of superpowers.
        But that was under the circumstances of a small number of people. With more people, everyone had guns. In addition to some weapons of mass destruction, in the wild, artillery, and direct artillery bombardment, as long as you were not stronger than three suns, three suns could be killed!
        The two of them chatted for a while, and not long after, Li Meng, the cheap Junior Sister, also came over.
        In the past, they had never mentioned anything about being in-name disciples, but now, they all wanted to tell everyone that they were family.
        Li Hao tried to hold back his laughter.
        He didn't ask how his teacher had taken in an in-name disciple, but even if he didn't ask, he knew that it would probably be very interesting. It was possible that he would force them to take him as a master. This was very likely.
        On this day, the entire law enforcement building was immersed in joy.
        Those who had advanced were happy, and those who hadn't had hope. They were all excited and wanted to destroy Red Moon immediately.
        [PS: initial subscriptions are about 51000. Not bad, but the number of initial subscriptions boosted by the event is not very accurate. I'll be happy for a while, and that's it. Thank you for your support. The right way is to reach an average subscription of 50000 as soon as possible. Old Eagle, continue to work hard!]
       
        The Silver City regained its peace.
        Everyone had just advanced and had begun to cultivate bitterly. Their mysterious energy wasn't bad. At this moment, everyone's goal was naturally to stabilize their realm and advance one more step.
        Even though Li Hao was improving rapidly, he still had room for improvement.
        He still had a lot of the five elements that his teacher had exchanged for him.
        Although he couldn't advance any further in a short period of time to enter the Qian warrior realm, strengthening his five internal organs would be very beneficial for him when he entered the Qian warrior realm in the future.
        ……
        The Silver City fell silent.
        The outside world, however, was not so peaceful.
        About a thousand miles away from Silver City, in the southern region, there was a huge Canyon. Twenty years ago, this place was called the cross-section Canyon by the locals, and it divided the entire Silver Moon province into two.
        Hence, Silvermoon province was divided into two regions, North and South.
         Silver City was to the North, while white moon City was to the South.
        Silver Moon province was named after the north and south cities, with Silver City in front and white moon behind.
        From the White moon City to the Silver City, they had to pass through the cross-section Canyon.
        The transverse Canyon was not open to traffic. There used to be a suspension bridge, but it was destroyed. After that, no one came to bridge it anymore. This was also the reason why powerhouses like Huang Yun would choose to fly across the transverse Canyon.
        As for ordinary people, it was not impossible to pass through. They just needed to go down the small path, enter the crosscut Canyon, pass through the canyon, and then go up the mountain path. The journey was difficult, but it was also tens of miles long.
        The transverse Canyon was very long, and its width was frightening. It was called a Canyon, but in fact, it was more like a huge basin. The widest part was more than 30 kilometers. Even if they were to fly, ordinary Warriors would not fly there. It was too wide.
        The Hengduan Canyon, which used to be empty.
        Today, there were a few more tents in the northern area of the canyon.
        At the bottom of the canyon, the tents were still being set up. One after another, they were not connected. Some of the tents were gathered together, while others were separated by hundreds or even thousands of meters.
        In the northernmost area, more than a dozen tents were set up.
        If Li Hao and the others were here, they would be able to recognize one of them. It was Huang Yun, an expert in the solar illumination realm, who was traveling at a very fast speed.
        At this moment, Huang Yun was in charge of supervising.
        A few Starlight Masters were setting up tents.
        While he was supervising, Huang Yun frowned slightly and looked in a direction. A moment later, a figure descended from the sky.
        The person who came was very tall.
        He had the back of a Tiger and the waist of a bear, like a demonic god.
        He was wearing a pair of extremely thick leather boots. When he stepped on the ground, a crack appeared.
        The night patrolmen who were setting up the tents around them quickly gathered together.
        Huang Yun also stood up and said,""Tiger soul, what are you doing here?"
        The brawny man glanced at him and said in a disdainful tone,""Move, we need to set up camp here!"
        Huang Yun frowned,"the Yama's camp is not here. According to our previous agreement, you will set up camp in an area 3000 meters away from here ..."
        "I'm determined to set up camp here today!"  The man called Tiger soul looked at Huang Yun coldly."To put it bluntly, I've taken a fancy to this place! This place has good feng shui, I like it!"
        "Tiger soul!"
        Huang Yun's face turned red with anger.
        Tiger soul, an expert from Yama's camp in Silver City.
        The three major organizations also had branches in Silvermoon province. Their structure was similar to the Nightwalker 's, if not stronger.
        The Yama had a Yama Hall Master in Silver Moon province.
        According to the night patrolman's information, the leader of the Yama organization called himself the Emperor of Yama, also known as the king of Yama.
        Below the King of Hell were the Ten Kings of Hell.
        On Silver Moon province's side, the person in charge was Yama Hall Master, who called himself the king of Samsara, and was also the tenth Hall Master.
        A three-Sun Expert!
        As for Tiger soul, he was an expert under the reincarnation King.
        The Samsara King was ranked at the bottom of the Yama organization. Out of the ten Yama Kings, the Samsara King was the weakest. However, this weakness was only relative. He was weak when compared to the entire Yama organization. However, in Silver Moon, the three suns were the sky.
        This time, the night patrollers joined forces with a few large organizations to explore the ruins together. As the ruins had been discovered long ago, these people had set up camp in advance and waited for the main group to arrive.
        Tiger soul was the expert in charge of Yama's encampment. He was in the sunlit realm and was quite powerful. He might even be slightly stronger than Huang Yun.
        Originally, they had already discussed where each clan would be stationed.
        Huang Yun didn't expect the Yama to suddenly take the initiative to provoke him.
        Tiger soul was clearly doing this on purpose!
        This wasn't a spur of the moment action, the other party must have planned this. Huang Yun even felt some strange gazes from nearby.
        Perhaps it was people from other organizations who were paying attention to this.
        Why so?
        Huang Yun pondered quickly. Could it be that he felt that the night patrolmen's encampment was better and that there was a secret behind it?
         Or was he just trying to probe the night patrolman's thoughts?
        As this thought flashed through his mind, Huang Yun understood that he could not retreat.
        If he retreated this time, the night patrolman would be at a disadvantage before the cooperation even started. By then, Hao lianchuan would not let him off.
        "Tiger soul!"
        Huang Yun's eyes turned cold,"is this your idea or the reincarnation King's idea?" Or was it the intention of the other experts of Yama? What's more ... Is it the other superpower organizations?"
        Tiger soul looked at him coldly."I said, because I like it here! Wind Devil, don't think that you can be on the same level as me just because you're fast. Today, if you don't move away, we'll see who's stronger!"
        Huang Yun cursed in his heart and was a little annoyed.
        "You want to start a fight?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "So what if I am?"
        Tiger soul sneered,"I can break your small arms and legs with one slap, but I won't kill you. After all, you're still a night patrolman. Night patrolmen ... Are so powerful!"
       
        Huang Yun could feel the anger of the night patrollers behind him. He knew that if this continued, he would disappoint them.
        He didn't say anything more. He quickly formed a hurricane sword in his hand and said coldly,""Tiger soul, if you want to die, then I'll fulfill your wish! Back then, you committed a crime of murder in the Silver City, and the night patrolmen have been hunting you down. If it wasn't for the reincarnation King stopping them, they would have killed you long ago. You're quite bold, to even dare to provoke us ..."
        "Hahaha!"
        Tiger soul laughed out loud,"wanted?" The night patrolmen are after me? I'm so scared, I was scared to death!"
        As soon as he finished speaking, he punched him!
        This punch was as heavy as Mount Tai.
        It was like a mountain pressing down. The power of the earth element was not the defensive type. Every element might have the same element, but it did not mean that there was no difference.
        Earth could be used for both defense and offense.
        A huge mountain came crashing down on the yellow cloud.
        "Die!" Huang Yun shouted and waved his sword. A hurricane erupted and swept across the world.
         The two sun glory powerhouses instantly started fighting.
        ……
        In the distance.
        Some people were watching the battle.
        Between a cliff, a few figures flickered, all of them wearing ghost masks.
        This was the standard of the Crimson Moon.
        "After Tiger soul entered sunlight, his strength improved extremely fast. However, this guy is very arrogant."
        "There's a reason for him to be arrogant. Tiger soul had only been in Yama for a few years, and it had only been five years since then, right? He's already in sunlight and he can even suppress the old super Huang Yun. He has the right to be arrogant. "
        "I heard that Tiger soul is also from the Silver City?"
        "En, Speaking of which, I have some disputes with the blizzard Silver city's Inspection Office ... No, the night patrolmen. I think Tiger soul killed the man of Liu Long's lover ..."
        "Hahaha, isn't that Liu Long's benefactor? How can it be considered a dispute? I think Liu Long should be pouring tea and toasting Tiger soul. "
        The few ghostly faces laughed and teased him.
        They didn't have a good impression of Silver City.
        Master Broken Sky died in the Silver City, and the higher-ups did not take revenge for the sake of the big picture. However, Red Moon had been one of the overlords of the superpowers since 20 years ago, so how could she bear such humiliation?
        If it wasn't for the fact that the higher-ups didn't allow it, and that there was Yuan Shuo, who had killed three suns, these people would have already killed their way over and destroyed the Silver City.
        After teasing him for a while, grimace continued,""Can Tiger soul be exchanged for an encampment?"
        Naturally, Tiger soul didn't change his base for no reason.
        There was also a tacit understanding between the three great organizations.
        We won't give the night patrolmen what they want.
        This was right.
         The Nightwalker wanted to station there because they lacked more understanding of the ruins. Whether the Nightwalker was stationed there randomly or deliberately, they had to break it.  These transcendent organisations weren't stupid. This time, the night patrolmen took the initiative to release the restrictions. They had fought many times in the past, so taking the initiative to give in might not be a good thing. Perhaps they had the intention of letting them explore the way.
        Everyone understood this.
        However, the three major organizations also knew about this. There was no reason for them not to eat the meat that was delivered to their door.
        The three major organizations not only needed him to participate, but also some small and medium-sized organizations in Silver Moon province. With more people, there would be a guarantee of safety. As for those small and medium-sized organizations who wanted a share, it would also depend on their strength.
        While they were talking, the battle in the distance became even more intense.
        The hurricane was like a sharp blade, cutting through the sky and earth. The sound of metal clashing could be heard.
        However, from the looks of the battle situation, Huang Yun was being suppressed. A huge mountain was pressing down on Huang Yun, and even the hurricane was dissipating. The ghostly faces of the red moon were also amazed.
        This Tiger soul's Mountain-suppressing technique was something that normal sunlight couldn't withstand.
        Huang Yun was considered a veteran superpower and had been in the superpower realm for more than ten years. He had a lot of experience in combat but he had no choice because he was being overpowered.
        "That Tiger soul does have the fighting style of a Martial Master ..."
        Someone said.
        "It's normal. Tiger soul is a Martial Master, a Martial Master who has cut Ten Realms. He was previously a security Captain at a company in Silver City. I have to say, after martial masters become supers, their physical fitness is indeed stronger than ordinary supers. Furthermore, these martial masters were trained through fighting, so they still have the strength. "
        Although martial masters had declined, they still had a lot of combat experience. All of them could fight.
        Even if they became supers, there were many top supers who were converted from martial masters back then.
        As he spoke, a loud boom was heard.
        In the distance, Huang Yun roared and a hurricane swept out, enveloping the entire mountain. Huang Yun was going all out!
        The mysterious energy exploded, lifting up countless rocks.
        At this moment, the mountain exploded with a loud bang.
        Tiger soul's tall figure suddenly stepped into the air and instantly landed on the ground. His face was filled with disdain. "You're going all out? Wind demon ... You're too weak! Forget it, I'm afraid that if I kill you, your night patrolman's three suns old man will come to find me, hahaha!"
         After saying that, he stepped into the air and left, leaving behind Huang Yun, who was bleeding from the corner of his mouth.
        ……
        "Yellow patrol city!"
        Behind him, a group of new night patrol soldiers stepped forward one after another, each of them looking worried.
        At the same time, his gaze was complicated.
        Huang Yun was defeated.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Although the other party had retreated in the end, Huang Yun was injured while the other party was completely fine. It was obvious that Huang Yun had lost the battle. It was only because the other party did not want to continue fighting that he had retreated.
        Huang Yun's expression turned ugly.
        He was defeated!
        He lost to Tiger soul, who had just advanced not long ago. He had been in the glorious sun for more than three years, while Tiger soul had only advanced to the glorious sun at the beginning of this year. It had only been half a year, not even a year.
       
        However, an old-school member of the sunlight sect like him was defeated.
        Being defeated wasn't scary. Geniuses were everywhere.
        However, losing to a wanted criminal, especially at this moment, was a huge blow to the night patrol's confidence.
        He looked in the direction that the Tiger soul had retreated in and gritted his teeth.
        This was a test by several large organizations ... And this time, he did not show the power of the night patrolman. Instead, he showed the night patrolman's weakness. The night patrolman's sunlight was just so-so.
        If he could kill this man with a single strike like Yuan Shuo, the other large organizations would definitely be wary of him.
        Moreover, this time, it was not the three major organizations that were even more difficult.
        Instead, they were small and medium-sized organizations that had come to participate in the exploration.
        The so-called small and medium-sized organizations were usually active within a province. In the organization, there were no existences above the three suns. The strongest three suns were called medium-sized organizations.
        The strongest sunlight was a small organization.
         As for the organization formed by the moon underworld superpower, it could not even be considered a superpower organization. The moon underworld was actually just a basic level. No matter how weak a Starlight master was, they were usually only at the beginning stage. They would soon surpass this starting stage and enter the moon underworld level.
        There were also some small and medium-sized organizations in Silver Moon province. This time, besides the three large organizations, there were two medium-sized organizations and more than ten small organizations.
        This was especially true for mid-sized organizations. They were not any weaker than the three major organizations in the province.
        The three great organizations were scattered all over the place, and their experts were scattered.
        Within the province, one or two three suns were in charge, and two or three were more. They didn't dare to expose all of them at once.
        As for the medium-sized organizations, their leaders might appear in person for this exploration. They would also be powerhouses of the three sun realm.
        In the battle at Tiger soul, it was very likely that a situation would occur. These organizations would also see the weakness of the night patrollers, and thus completely turn to the three major organizations and follow their lead.
        Huang Yun was extremely vexed!
        He was a little regretful. He regretted being impulsive. Even if he didn't make a move, the Tiger soul might not dare to make a move. However, he felt that he had been in the glorious sun realm for more than three years, while the other party only had half a year. He had hope of suppressing the other party.
        But he had overestimated himself and underestimated the Tiger soul.
        Three years of sunlight was not a short time in the field of superpowers. The development of superpowers had only been 20 years.
        However, he had still been defeated!
        Behind him, there was a new night patrolman who gritted his teeth. Those who were more experienced also knew the danger and shouted,""Yellow patrol city's strength is not in combat. Just now, it was a head-on attack. Yellow patrol city's strength lies in speed. In order to protect us, he didn't display his strength!"
        "Yes, that's right!"
        "So what if it's a big organization? The night patrol was the official authority! Don't forget, when Hongyue invaded Blizzard Silver City, a god tier master was killed in a small city, and he was a three sun god tier master. The one who killed them was only Martial Master douqian!"
         "Professor Yuan will be here this time as well. Let's see who among these guys dares to make trouble then."  Some of them were trying to boost their morale, while some of them really thought so. Many of them were no stranger to Yuan Shuo. After all, he had worked with the night patrollers for a long time and often explored the remains with them.
        The moment he thought of Yuan Shuo, his timidity from earlier was dispelled by quite a bit.
        That's right, so what if Yuan Shuo wasn't the night patrol?
        In the eyes of the night watchman, Yuan Shuo was in cahoots with them.
        Yuan Shuo had even killed three suns.
        This was the first time that a three-Sun Expert had been killed in Silver Moon province ... On the surface.
        Hou Xiaochen had also killed one before. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to obtain the three suns Blood God. However, in order to not fall out with the three major organizations, hou Xiaochen didn't publicize it too much.
        Huang Yun also gradually regained his calm.
        He didn't say anything more and regained his composure. He said in a deep voice,""Alright, I'm no match for that guy ... After all, I'm old and my talent isn't up to par. You're the future of the night patrollers. I've lost today, so you'll help me get back at him some other day. The strong are afraid of the young, and you're younger than him. That's what I want to see. "
        "It's said that Wang Ming killed a Dark Moon cultivator in Silver City. You're all in the same generation as him, so I hope you won't be left behind by him,"he added.
        "Brother Wang killed someone?"
        "Or Yue Ming? Last time, I heard that he was almost killed by a Dark Moon when he was carrying out a mission in Silver City ... Did he make a comeback?"
        “……”
        The young man's mind wasn't that deep. Hearing this, he immediately walked out of the defeat just now.
         Huang Yun didn't say much and let them discuss.
        He walked into one of the tents at the back.
        After entering the tent, Ling Chen was silent for a while before taking out a crystal screen. It gave off a faint mysterious energy, and after a while, hou Xiaochen's face appeared on the screen.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The screen trembled slightly, and hou Xiaochen's voice came through, "We're near the ruins, so the signal isn't too strong ... If you have anything to say, say it quickly ..."
        "Department head, the Tiger soul provoked me just now. I ... I was impulsive and took action to fight it, but I failed! Tiger soul and I are both at the early stage of the sun glory realm, and I'm even at the peak stage. He might only be at the beginning stage ... I ... I was defeated by him. "
        "Tiger soul?"
        Hou Xiaochen thought about it for a while before finally thinking of this person. He calmly said,"That wanted criminal? the hired thug of the Silver City's Qiao 's?"
        "It's him. "
        "Oh!"
        "I'm fine, it's normal,"hou Xiaochen replied calmly. Your wind element isn't very good at attacking, but he seems to be an earth element, right? He's even the heavy earth element of the earth element. Even though it's called the earth element, there's still some gravity suppression mixed in. If you don't run or use your speed to suppress him, you'll definitely be suppressed by him. "
