I was just playing!To think that I was even touched.Bastard!He poured his life force into my body and time power into me. Perhaps it was all for his own scheme.And the firmament sword!The sword in his hand ... She was slightly shocked. This sword seemed to have merged with all of Li Hao's stars and killed a venerable sovereign with one strike. Those stars ... Seemed to be all the stars that Li Hao had condensed before.This bastard ... Did he really plan everything?His sword contained his great Dao stars, while his body contained the power of time, the power of life and death. All of this ... Meant that he could revive him!"And only I know ... That even the celestial pole didn't see it clearly. That moment was too short."Hmph!"At that moment, Lin Hongyu suddenly snorted. Everyone was shocked. What's wrong?Hong Yitang frowned slightly. Was it because he said that he wouldn't give up the Dao universe unless he wanted to resurrect Li Hao, which made her angry?Or was she ... Warning someone?At that moment, Lin Hongyu looked at the crowd coldly."There's a high chance of resurrecting him! However, I need everyone's help, including ... The temporary fusion of the truth Dao and the void Dao universe to stimulate the dead Time and Stars, to bring them back to life and create the power of time ... Of course, currently, the difficulty is very high!"She then looked at the celestial pole."Senior, since you have no intention of fighting for the Silver Moon ... Then I'll be frank with you. Please protect me. I'll take it as Li Hao owing you a favor!"Tian Ji was stunned. 'You owe me a favor just like that?'What was going on?Lin Hongyu suddenly laughed. Her face, which was filled with death and killing intent, suddenly revealed a seductive smile."This time, if Li Hao is resurrected, he will owe everyone a favor! I will repay you one by one!"Yes, they all owed!Alright, you're testing me, right?Then I'll ... Let you test me!I want you to owe everyone a debt ... Next time, will you still be so ruthless?"You're so aloof, so cold ... I won't let you be satisfied. I'll make you regret it the moment you die. You actually gave me this opportunity, so I'll let you live. I'll also let you bear a bunch of favors so that you won't dare to die so easily!In the moment of death, Li Hao was so calm, as if death was nothing ... Such a state of mind made Lin Hongyu feel scared and desperate.How could you do this?In this world, is there really no one or thing that you care about at all?"This time, I still need the help of the people to gather the power of heaven and earth and the power of 10000 DAOs!" She said loudly. Silvermoon beings, come with me and revive Marchioness Silvermoon!""Lord Marquis has been resurrected, and the world's prosperity will last forever!""Lord Marquis still has many grand plans that haven't been realized. He turned the Silver Moon into a large world and let everyone enter the mountains, seas, sun, and moon ... This world gave birth to him and raised him. I think that Lord Marquis won't give up on everyone, and no one will give up on Lord Marquis!"Lin Hongyu's smile was as bright as ever!That smile ... Was like Li Hao 's!Everyone was in a daze. They suddenly had a strange feeling ... Lin Hongyu couldn't have been possessed by Li Hao, could she?Why ... Did his smile look as real as Li Hao 's?Even Hong Yitang was slightly confused as he looked at her ... Lin Hongyu's smile was really meaningful.Whether Li Hao could be resurrected or not ... They didn't have much hope. They just kept their uneasiness and fear to themselves. But at this moment, Lin Hongyu seemed to be very confident. Not only that, but she also owed Li Hao so many favors.He was a person who didn't like to owe people favors ... But now, did they really need the people to work together?He didn't know!However, Hong Yitang knew that if Li Hao could really be resurrected ... He would probably collapse and unknowingly owe everyone. Just as everyone was in a daze.In the distance, the cat who had been in a daze suddenly seemed to wake up. It looked over at Lin Hongyu and meowed, which caught everyone's attention.This cat ... It had been silent all this while, and everyone had almost forgotten its existence.It was too lacking in presence!At this moment, the other party seemed to have just woken up. Was his reaction too slow?The cat looked at Lin Hongyu and meowed again.In everyone's ears, it was just a call.In Lin Hongyu's ears, it turned into a human voice. The young and confused voice said,""Meow ... If that person comes back to life, the lightning will come again ..."Lin Hongyu's expression changed instantly!Would it come again?"Only when he becomes the inner world, isolating himself from the world and the chaos, can he avoid ..."Lin Hongyu was a little dazed. This cat ... Seemed to know a lot."He turned the Tao into stars and separated the heaven and earth from the three saints. He should know that the Tao is a treasure sword. He used the eight weapons to separate chaos to survive in death ... What a smart person!"Second cat seemed to be a little emotional. What a smart person. It only understood now. That person had thought it through in a short time! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  He's as smart as war!If not for this, the other party would have died without a doubt. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation would not stop until it killed him, cutting off all hope of his revival.However, in the end, the other party had instantly set up a lot of traps ... Or rather, they had already set up a trap.That's amazing!Lin Hongyu's heart trembled as she transmitted her voice to the two cats,""Senior, what should I do?""You!""Me?""That's right. You're half-alive and half-dead. It's so strange ... You're a little detached from heaven and earth and from the chaos ... You should be able to cover it up by filling heaven and earth with death aura and covering the sky. When he comes back to life, he should be able to solve it himself ... That person is very smart!"Lin Hongyu's heart skipped a beat. 'So that's the reason. There's another layer to it.'Li Hao, you bastard!Why didn't he say it thoroughly?You want everyone to guess your thoughts!If I didn't think of this, if I didn't think of this ... Once you're resurrected, will you instantly attract lightning and be struck to death again?So, I'm a little stupid, and I'm not worthy of resurrecting you?"Meow ... If you resurrect him and you can't hide it, it will attract lightning ... I can swallow some ... If you need my help ... I can help ..."Then, second cat was a little confused."But ... Maybe he has other thoughts ... Ask him when he's resurrected!""Many thanks, senior!"Lin Hongyu was a little shocked. She then thought to herself,"did Li Hao, that heartless guy, include the cat in his plan?"You're really not a good thing!Hmph!If I didn't resurrect you ... You probably wouldn't care, right?The more he thought about it, the more helpless he felt.Sure enough, the more capable a man was, the more heartless he would be. But why did she feel that this kind of man was more and more attractive?Lin Hongyu, you're such a B * stard! You should've seized the opportunity to take control of Silver Moon and become its King!

2491 Chapter 415
Lin Hongyu had a better idea of what Li Hao was thinking.Time, life and death, eight weapons hiding stars.If that was Li Hao's plan ... It meant that he was confident of being resurrected. Lin Hongyu had more thoughts.Everyone was gathered here, including the new martial artists, the king of Dali, and the Queen of the West.She glanced at the Queen of the West ... This stupid Queen of the West had overturned everyone's imagination today, even though too much had happened, making her previous comeback seem not worth mentioning.It was possible that she had escaped from the battle between venerable sovereigns and even lent Li Hao the power of the Silver Moon. Most importantly, she and Li Hao were cultivators of the same generation and age.Li Hao was extremely ruthless. After killing so many enemies, was there any other enemy of Li Hao in the world?However, this woman, who had opposed Li Hao many times and even made Li Hao suffer for the first time, was still alive. She was obviously not simple.Lin Hongyu thought about this but did not show it. She was still as cold as frost and filled with death Qi. She said coldly,""Since everyone is determined to resurrect Lord Marquis, it will save us a lot of trouble!""We have gathered here today to acknowledge your rule ... King of Dali, Your Majesty, what do you think?"The Dali King's expression was complicated."What ideas can I have? I don't even have a future. I can't summon it!" Li Hao promised me that if I killed a half-Emperor, he would give me a half-Emperor body ... Now that it's been destroyed by the lightning, I can only wait for him to resurrect and fulfill his promise. "Besides, what else could I be thinking?Didn't he see how this powerhouse from Heaven's Fate had revealed the secret of killing his own ancestor in order to clear his relationship with him?Without the celestial pole's help, he was only a Heavenly King and not a half-step Emperor who had absorbed The Phantom image. What could he do?Not doing anything was the best decision.The Queen was also cold and arrogant. She glanced at Lin Hongyu, who was filled with death Qi, and seemed to feel the hostility from the other party. She was slightly cautious and said coldly,""Li Hao borrowed a large amount of my Silver Moon Power. It's a loan, not a gift ... I can only wait for him to revive and return my Silver Moon Power!"The two kings chose to wait for Li Hao's resurrection.As for whether he would succeed ... Who knew?It was a last resort!Regardless of whether it was true or not, everyone needed a target now. Otherwise, if they really thought that Li Hao was dead, a big problem would immediately arise, and a large-scale massacre might even occur.Lin Hongyu did not say much and said,""Alright then. Since no one has any objections, let's work hard in one place. Just like before, the people will pray and gather their faith in the great path of the universe!" "Uncle-master Hong and general Ying ... You can try to merge them temporarily and stimulate the recovery of Time and Stars. See if you can reignite the extinguished stars!"He then added in a cold tone,"both of you are people that the Marquis trusts. You must not move his heart now. I'll say the ugly words first. Whether it's general Ying or senior uncle Hong, if either of you attempt to devour the other, you'll be faced with a battle to kill Silvermoon!""Of course not!" Hong Yitang nodded."I won't do that!"Qian Wuliang also said in a hurry,"how can that be? Wuliang is only where he is today because of the Marquis. It is my duty to revive the Marquis. Why would I fight with Dean Hong for the power of Dao?"Lin Hongyu looked at him again. This man ... Was actually very smart.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣  He was definitely a smart person.Sometimes, smart people were hard to deal with. Qian Wuliang didn't show any disloyalty even though he had become the master of Phantom path and Li Hao had died. Instead, he was so enthusiastic that he wanted to resurrect Li Hao ... If Li Hao couldn't resurrect him, Lin Hongyu probably couldn't do anything to him!"Then, let's do our own thing ..."As he said this, he suddenly raised his head and looked at a door in the sky. It appeared vaguely and he frowned slightly,""This Stargate ... Back then, someone said that it could be opened when the eight divine weapons gathered. Can the firmament sword open the Stargate now?"This was a very important question!The Silver Moon was still in a sealed state, but if the firmament sword could open a Stargate ... It might cause some trouble.Of course, she could choose not to say it.But at this moment, she still said it out loud. She glanced at Zhang an and the others from the corner of her eye and said in a deep voice,""If the Stargate is opened ... It'll be best if the outside world is a new martial world. If it's within the Crimson Moon world ... It'll be troublesome!""Previously, Emperor Cang's projection seemed to be unable to cross over ... Instead, it was the Crimson Moon bone corrosion Imperial Emperor who fell and a cry for help rang out ... I'm guessing that we're most likely within the Crimson Moon world's coverage!"Her deduction was not a wild guess.Despite Emperor Cang's strength, he was still unable to rush over quickly. The distance was clearly very far. However, the sound of the great Dao could be heard from the Crimson Moon world."The two chaos lightning tribulations before this," she continued,"caused quite a stir when the Silvermoon world leveled up. Even if the Silvermoon was like dust before and no one noticed it, now that it's made such a big stir ... And within the Crimson Moon's range, will it attract the attention of the Crimson Moon experts?""They should know that the eroding bones attacked the Silver Moon, and now that Emperor eroding bone is dead ... I'm more worried about whether the Crimson Moon experts are already near the Silver Moon, considering the chaos.""More importantly ... Can the other party break through the Stargate and enter the Silvermoon world?"

2492 Chapter 415
Everyone's expression changed slightly. Even celestial pole frowned slightly."Your guess is not without reason!"It was not a wild guess. Of course, Lin Hongyu must have meant to intimidate the new martial arts.Once the Stargate is opened ... There will be Crimson Moon experts outside, and you will all be in trouble!Even though celestial pole had the power of a half-Emperor and his clone wasn't afraid of death ... The other party had two cats with him, so he didn't dare to act rashly.On the surface, it was saying that everyone was in danger.In fact, it had greatly intimidated the neo martial artists.Even if Li Hao dies, you won't get anything out of it. On the other hand, if Li Hao comes back to life, with his talent, strength, and wisdom ... Even if he's within the range of the Crimson Moon, he might be able to get everyone out of here safely.At this moment, Zhang an still opened his mouth and said in a calm voice,""Don't worry. We won't do anything. We won't seize the firmament sword and try to open the Stargate! The Stargate could not be opened just by gathering eight soldiers. Once the Stargate is opened, the Silver Moon's aura will leak out. Even if no one can discover it before, it will be discovered very quickly. We've already waited 100000 years. If Li Hao can really be resurrected, why would we still need to wait a little longer?"He wasn't stupid.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 As the group of people conversed, they all expressed their stances. All of them had reached an agreement.Resurrecting Li Hao had also become a consensus.At this moment, Lin Hongyu was no longer polite. She resolved the thoughts of the powerful cultivators and said,""In addition, Dao Jian, the ninth master, His Majesty the deity, His Majesty the king of Dali, I have a small request!"Her tone was no longer gentle,"in order to avoid any misunderstandings, the four powerhouses will not participate in Lord Marquis's resurrection!" "Everyone in new martial arts ... I trust you, but you're not familiar with the new Dao. Senior Zhang, I'll have to trouble you with something. Go to Dali with these four powerhouses and comprehend the new Dao for a period of time!"These words were very direct.The king of Dali was a little unhappy, but the Queen looked indifferent. Dao Jian bowed slightly to show that she had no objection.As for the ninth Division commander, he had a complicated look in his eyes.Was it reasonable for Lin Hongyu to exclude herself?There was.That was his brother!Li daoheng was his blood brother. If Li Hao didn't cause trouble, Silvermoon world ... Would actually be li daoheng 'S. Zheng Yu couldn't beat him, but bone erosion Emperor was obviously no match for him. He would be played to death sooner or later.And the celestial pole doppelganger ... Was even less of a match.If not for Li Hao, the one standing here today would probably be li daoheng. He controlled the entire Silver Moon and even devoured the two-Dao universe and the Silver Moon, stepping into the relatively strong level of venerable sovereigns in one fell swoop. He was no ordinary venerable sovereign.The neo martial Saints were not fools. Although Lin Hongyu's words were a little repulsive ... Everyone fell silent and did not say much.The ninth Division commander did not say anything. "Alright ..." Zhang an nodded."Senior, you still need to temporarily withdraw from your truth path star!" The moment he said this, there were still people who were dissatisfied. The Saint of the Zhang clan said in a deep voice,""There's no need for that, right? Director Zhang was the descendant of a Supreme martial artist. Since he had agreed, he would definitely not go back on his word. Governor Lin's move, if Marquis li were to be resurrected, would he also feel that it was inappropriate? "When Marquis li was still around, he never took any precautions against director Zhang. We're friends ..."A thought appeared in everyone's mind. This woman ... Was really not as generous as the man.When Li Hao was here, things wouldn't have been like this.Li Hao had always been polite to Zhang an. Even when his master died in battle, Li Hao did not fall out with Zhang an. He only gave a few warnings not to interfere in the matter between him and new martial arts.He was also secretly intimidating them and didn't say it out loud.But today, Lin Hongyu had actually publicly expressed that she was worried about Zhang an. This made many neo martial artists a little dissatisfied.Zhang an said,"alright, I'll leave first. It's just that ... The new Dao is adapted to the great Dao universe. It can't be stored outside for too long.""I understand!""Yes!" Lin Hongyu nodded."When the time comes, you can return to the great Dao universe!"Zhang an did not say anything else.Lin Hongyu did not seem to care if they were satisfied or not. If she had the intention to unify the world, she should be more careful at this moment. She should try to rope them in, but did she think ... That there was a need?No need!Since that was the case, of course, safety first. Although everyone seemed United now ... Only they knew the exact situation. It was necessary to be safe."That's it then ... We can't delay any longer. From today onwards, we'll start making preparations for the Marquis's resurrection ...""Let's search the Silver Moon region and collect the broken heaven's will. Let's see if we can use this as a guide to gather the broken heaven's will and revive the Marquis!" She said.She quickly assigned tasks to everyone. At this moment, no one said anything and they all followed her orders.At this moment, what he lacked was the backbone.Since Lin Hongyu had come forward and wanted to revive Li Hao first, they would give it a try, whether they believed it or not.……After everyone left, Heaven's Fate and second cat also left."Seniors, please wait for a moment ... I have something to say," Lin Hongyu suddenly said.The man and cat stopped.Heaven's Fate was a little puzzled. Why are you calling me instead of collecting heaven's will?Lin Hongyu was silent for a while before she said,""Previously, the world was divided into eight parts, and the bloody blade was located in a small world, a small space ... Both seniors know that you can also enter it. I hope that you two seniors can protect me. When Li Hao is resurrected, I will definitely thank you!"

"What?" celestial pole was stunned.Weren't they not ready yet?Lin Hongyu was a little hesitant, worried that the celestial pole would do something, but after thinking about it again and again, she made a decision.""That was just a pretense! I alone am enough to revive Li Hao!"“……”艹!Heaven's Fate cursed inwardly. They're really good-for-nothings. Li Hao is like this, and this woman is also like this.Who was he guarding against?'We've already come to this point, and the group of people have already expressed their stance. So ... You're just trying to fool us?'Who was he acting for?At this time, would there really be people who would stand up and rebel?"Aren't you afraid that I'll ...""I believe in you, senior. Li Hao also believes in you!"Lin Hongyu looked sincere."If he didn't believe in it, Li Hao could have shared the last lightning tribulation with all the seniors. In fact ... Since Li Hao didn't do that and didn't kill all the powerful cultivators, it means that those who survived are people he trusts!""But I ... Am a woman after all. A woman's heart is slightly narrow, and it concerns the life and death of her husband. Naturally, I am more cautious ... I hope senior can forgive me!"What else could Heaven's Fate say?He said,"I'm not guarding against you, I'm just worried. Look, I've already asked you to guard me, and I absolutely trust you. In fact, Heaven's Fate and Li Hao have the least contact."What else could Heaven's Fate say?He nodded and didn't say much. He quickly said,""That place is indeed not bad. It is the true center of the world! The blood Emperor created a small space in the past, but it still belongs to Silvermoon. It's not a bad choice to resurrect there. "This woman's brain was quite active. She was not simple to be able to choose a place so quickly.However, could she really revive Li Hao on her own?Who knows!Also, could Li Hao really be resurrected?Celestial pole was a venerable sovereign, after all, so he had some experience. After hesitating for a moment, he still asked,""Can they really be resurrected?""I don't know. We'll know once we try."What a perfunctory answer!Heaven's Fate was also speechless. On the other hand, second cat was enthusiastic,""Little celestial pole ... You're celestial pole, right? I seem to remember now ... You're the son of the Western Emperor ... I think it's possible to resurrect you ..."Heaven's Fate was helpless. Give me some face and don't call me that in front of outsiders.I'm not small in front of these people.I've lived for many years in the neo martial era. I'm more than 200000 years old, right?He had forgotten about it!  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 As a venerable sovereign, in the entire Silvermoon world, other than you, I am the most senior! Fortunately, this projection of Emperor Cang had a different personality. If Emperor Cang was here ... Heaven's Fate would have run away long ago and not chat with it. At this moment, Heaven's Fate did not refute and nodded. "That's good!"Er Mao was floating in the air, following Heaven's Fate and Lin Hongyu. As they flew, he said,""Little celestial pole, was that chubby one a big cat? Why did big cat get fatter?"“……”Heaven's Fate was speechless. 'How would I know?' besides, Emperor Cang could eat and drink. There was nothing he didn't eat. It would be strange if he didn't get fat after eating all day long.He was thinking about how to answer when second cat said,"The teacher, Is He Dead?"A teacher ...Heaven's Fate was a little dazed as he glanced at second cat.The teacher it was talking about ... Was Zhan Tiandi.The peerless heaven's favorite who illuminated an era!Is He Dead?Die ... Right!The earth returned to its former glory. He had never thought of being resurrected. Therefore, the blood Emperor had never rushed to help him. It was his own choice.In the era of the nine emperors and four Emperors, only that one ... Was truly free and easy. If I left, I left. If I stayed, I stayed. No one in the world could kill me. I just couldn't bear to see people's hearts change so I left.Heaven's Fate was slightly dazed. At this moment, for some reason, he thought of Li Hao.He thought of this ... Weak fellow who was actually different from Zhan Tiandi. Li Hao did not look like a human King at all, but ... Why did he look a little like Zhan Tiandi?Of course, he was not as pure as Zhan Tiandi.However, he was also so carefree. If he wanted to die, he would die. Even if he died, he would not die in the hands of the enemy. He would decide whether to stay or leave.Celestial pole thought of some past events and was silent for a while. He then said,""I don't know. Maybe he went to another world to have fun!" Even he sighed when he mentioned this person.Second cat didn't seem sad. He only felt a little regretful."Oh ... It should be! I remember now. That day, he said that he was leaving and even brought me along to eat delicious food in another world!"He didn't say anything else.He just kept silent.It originated from the projection world and had lived with Zhan Tiandi since birth. During those countless years ... The only thing it remembered in its life was the scholar who taught.It didn't know why it had been resurrected ... Was it really good to be resurrected?Heaven's Fate was also silent.Resurrecting the two cats had been the blood Emperor's decision, and it had been difficult to succeed. Even at Silver Moon, it had only been a gamble. In the end, they had really been resurrected, but ... So what if they had been resurrected?Zhan Tiandi was dead!He suddenly felt that resurrecting the two cats was not a good decision. Zhan Tiandi was dead. Resurrecting the two cats would only make it sad.He wasn't familiar with this cat, but he knew that it was one of the arrows that had injured the heavenly Emperor. Emperor Cang had wanted to bring it back, but it had rejected him.

2494 Chapter 415
Lin Hongyu had been listening in front of them.She didn't know much about the new martial era's secrets, but she knew that this cat was the projection of the new martial era's Emperor Cang. Now it seemed that there were many stories."Li Hao can turn back time. In the future ..." She said."No need," second cat said.Lin Hongyu was stunned but did not say anything.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 However, it was a little strange. This cat ... Was he really one with the legendary Emperor Cang?Why did it feel like ... There was no similarity at all?Also, she couldn't see through the other party's strength.……In silence, the two humans and one cat entered the small space where the ruins of Star Town City were.This place still existed.Lin Hongyu examined the place and found it to be a decent place. Even though it was only a small space within the Silver Moon, it could still hide many things.She didn't delay.The longer the night, the more dreams.If time passed and the situation could not be reversed, Li Hao would be completely dead, which would be bad.Although that heartless person might not care about his own life and death, how could he let him be free and unrestrained?He shouldn't be given a day to rest!He would die today and live today.Although the Silver Moon crisis had been resolved, he did not know what was happening in the outside world. It would be a fool's dream if he wanted to steal half a day of leisure."Seniors, I've used the aura of death to cover the heavens and earth. With life and death as my Foundation and the eight weapons and stars as my bones ... I've tried to manipulate time. If the aura of death can't block the chaos lightning tribulation ...""There's more?"celestial pole shuddered.艹!I want to go home!To be honest, even if his true body came, he would have a hard time dealing with this.There wouldn't be more, right?Do you really want to come here three times a day?I'm just a half-Emperor avatar, don't torture me like this."I'm saying what if ..."Tian Ji had a headache."Little girl, let me put it this way. If that thing really comes, although I'm a half-step sovereign, I really can't do anything about it. You saw it just now ... If that's the case, I ... I'll run away!"She didn't blush at all."It's just a clone. Not to mention a clone, even if my true body is here, I'll say the same thing. If that thing comes, I'll run.Let's talk openly!I'm not going to play games with you!Lin Hongyu was speechless. Was he really a venerable sovereign?He felt that this courage ... Was not even as good as bone erosion.Alright, it wasn't without reason that this person had lived a long life."Sure!" "That's good!"Heaven's Fate heaved a sigh of relief.Lin Hongyu did not say anything more. At this moment, death energy filled the world. Celestial pole checked and was still a little confused."The neo martial world is divided into yin and yang. Life in yang and death in Yin ... There is also the division of life and death! But ... To be honest, this is the first time I've seen you being half-alive and half-dead ... The difference between the new Dao of Silver Moon and the new Dao of martial arts is still quite big. "Lin Hongyu shook her head. She did not know what to say. She did not know why she was like this.Li Hao seemed to have done something to her ... In any case, she should have been dead before, but Li Hao had pulled her back.Perhaps only Li Hao knew how he had done it.Who cares!In any case, she knew that she should still be a living person at this moment ... Although she was full of death Qi and had a sense of Quietus, she was indeed a living person.He didn't say too much. The aura of death spread and covered the small space.At this moment, a sword flew out.Three treasures appeared indistinctly-a tree, a seal, and a stone.And inside, there seemed to be stars appearing faintly.The stars of time seemed to be within it, but they had been destroyed.When the sword appeared ... Lin Hongyu understood something. The power of time in her body was not the key to resurrection. Instead, it was to trigger the time stars and revive them!Only then would more and more time energy be born. This was only a catalyst."Hmph!"Lin Hongyu suddenly snorted coldly again. Heaven's Fate was confused.However, Lin Hongyu thought of a problem ... If she did not resurrect this fellow, would the fusion of the truth Dao and Phantom Dao universes trigger the recovery of Time and Stars?If he could ... Did that mean that Li Hao could be resurrected?Was he waiting?!He was not only waiting for him, but also for Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang. If either of them wanted to devour the other, he would come back again!Or, if an outsider devoured two of them, he would return!It wasn't that he really couldn't come back and had given up.Instead ... He was thinking,'if nothing happens, I won't care anymore. If something happens, he might come from the end of time and space again.'Lin Hongyu felt that she might be overthinking things ... But she couldn't help but think about it. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that this guy was such a person.If Qian Wuliang really dared to try to devour Hong Yitang ... He would probably be surprised to find that Li Hao appeared behind his head and cut him into pieces! The corners of Lin Hongyu's mouth curled up slightly. This guy was really overbearing.If I don't let you swallow, you're not allowed to swallow!I'll return and kill you if you dare to have any thoughts about me. You're indeed the man I, Lin Hongyu, have chosen!By the side, celestial pole was even more puzzled ... What was this girl thinking?Perverted?One moment smiling, the next angry, the next dazed ... Are you even doing your proper work?As Lin Hongyu's thoughts ran wild, a wave of life energy spread out from her body. A weak time power suddenly surged into the firmament sword.The firmament sword suddenly trembled.It was as if a star had been ignited in the depths of the sword.At that moment ... Lin Hongyu's expression changed slightly. She looked up at the sky. Even though she was isolated by the death Qi, she seemed to feel the power of heaven!

As if it had ignited a star, it once again attracted the attention of the primal Chaos lightning.Heaven's Fate's expression also changed slightly. That feeling ... Made his heart palpitate. F * ck, was the third chaos lightning tribulation really coming?At that moment, second cat raised his chubby head and looked up at the sky. Suddenly, he opened his mouth. He didn't swallow the sky and earth. He just spat out some special energy that covered the small space.The original heavenly might ... Instantly dissipated."Cover me. I don't know the power of time, but I do know how to isolate the world. We used to live in an isolated space," second cat said weakly.It was a projected world that was isolated from the outside world and almost did not exist in the main world.At this moment, it was using this energy."Thank you, senior!" Lin Hongyu quickly expressed her gratitude.She was really a good cat!In the new martial era, everyone was afraid of Emperor Cang ... It was really strange. This cat was so good.Although it was not Emperor Cang, wasn't it one?Just as she was thinking about this, she didn't need to do anything else. Suddenly, the firmament sword trembled violently. Stars emerged from the illusion and began to arrange themselves.Gradually, an illusionary sword appeared between heaven and earth.This was the meridian of a great Dao formed by 360 stars!However, they were all very dim.Only the star in the center glowed slightly. The source of the light was the power of time in Lin Hongyu's body.Drops of water gradually appeared on the illusory sword. One drop after another, the power of time started to appear. It seeped into the world and covered the stars, forming a tiny, invisible river of time.At this moment, the 360 stars were half illusory and half real.Suddenly, it was as if the world had just been created.The power of the great path emerged, and stars were ignited, erupting with brilliant light. The power of the great path appeared in the long river, mixing with the river of time and merging into it.One, two, three ...In the blink of an eye, over a hundred stars were ignited.At this moment, Li Hao had yet to appear.Lin Hongyu was extremely nervous. She didn't do anything. Everything happened naturally. As she had guessed, Li Hao was prepared. They didn't have to wait for someone to resurrect him.In fact, he could resurrect himself, or he could use himself as a guide, or he could combine his two DAOs as a guide!This guy really had a backup plan!How terrifying!The stars were lit up one by one, and the power of great DAOs poured into the river. The sound of the stream gradually became clearer. Not far away, the celestial pole was also shocked. This guy ... Was really F * cking capable! He was only missing a catalyst, and he could actually reverse and be Reborn!艹!If this thing could really walk out of the Silver Moon ... Who knew how many experts would be killed by it?In the Silvermoon world alone, he felt that if no one had advanced to venerable sovereign, they would not be able to do anything to those few ... In the end, even though Li Hao had borrowed countless future powers, he was still not a venerable sovereign.But even so, a group of people were still killed.He was really killing people invisibly!In his shock, he felt more and more that ... It was better for him to stay away from this guy. This kind of person was not to be trifled with. He should not even add on to the already perfect splendor. It was best if everyone minded their own business.Under such a delicate situation, the river suddenly began to fluctuate, as if the world had just been born.Suddenly, a stone sank to the bottom of the river.In an instant, the river stopped flowing and rocks covered the river. In an instant, the river turned into soil. Lin Hongyu's expression changed. Celestial pole's heart also moved. Seeing Lin Hongyu's anxiety, he quickly said,"This is the whetstone of the revered sword artist. It ... Shouldn't harm Li Hao ..."Second cat looked at him in a daze for a long time before saying,""I'm fine. This man ... He's going to reopen the heaven and earth and open up a small world ..."As he said that, an extremely illusionary figure suddenly appeared on the long river that had turned into the ground.It was unknown where he came from, but he was extremely illusionary. Between his brows, there was a star Mark. It was actually a time star. His eyes were like the bright moon, looking out through time.He looked at Lin Hongyu and seemed to be smiling. "You're quite intelligent ... Also, thank you for protecting me, seniors!"He said.He walked on the land that was formed by the long river, but his voice seemed to reverberate through space and time.""How long have I been in a deep sleep?"Lin Hongyu had always answered Li Hao's questions with respect. Today, she sneered. "I've been sleeping for an hour!"“……”Li Hao's body froze.How long?An hour?  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 This ... Even dealing with Silver moon's miscellaneous matters would take more time than this, right?A sword appeared in his hand, and he shattered a star with one strike. Everyone was stunned. The star was shattered by him and instantly turned into the power of the great path, which instantly merged into the long river.He was actually breaking the great Dao!"That's too short!" Li Hao raised his eyebrows."Did something happen to Silver Moon?"Lin Hongyu's face was calm."No, I'm fine. It's just that you're in trouble. Naturally, I have to resurrect my husband as soon as possible! In order to resurrect my husband, I was worried that something would go wrong, so I let the billions of lives in Silver Moon pray for my husband in the outside world. With a devout heart, I prayed for my husband to be immortal! Martial uncle Hong and the others are all preparing for your husband's resurrection and have given up on cultivation and everything ... Heaven's Fate and senior cat are also not asking for anything in return and are currently protecting you ..."In short, everyone is running around for you!The Silver Moon was extremely peaceful!Li Hao looked at Lin Hongyu from a distance and slashed another star. The star turned into the power of the great Dao again and merged with the river.

Li Hao was silent for a moment. Then, he said,"since you resurrected me so quickly ... You should understand. I don't need their help. It's a waste of money and people ..."Lin Hongyu was also very calm."Everyone is so enthusiastic. They see you as their King, God, and master. How can you disappoint them?""Lin Hongyu ..." He said.Li Hao slashed the stars he had painstakingly condensed with his sword, shattering them one by one. The entire long river World instantly expanded countless times. He was somewhat dissatisfied. "You're creating trouble for me!""No, I'm stupid. I'm not even as good as the Queen of the West ... I don't understand what you mean. I just want you to be resurrected safely!"Li Hao was stunned. He helplessly ignored her.Are you stupid?You're not stupid!It's just that ... It makes me look stupid. If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have looked for you. What a trap!At this moment, Lin Hongyu's lips curled up slightly.You have nothing to say?"What's wrong?" she looked across space and time."Why do you need to cut through the stars?""The 10000 DAOs can just converge, why is there a need to be so clear?""Summon your Natal star," Li Hao said."I'll break it with my sword later!"“……”Lin Hongyu did not say much. She began to gather the stars in her body. Li Hao turned his head again."Break it with a single sword, understand?""I'm stupid, I'm ignorant, I don't understand!"“……”Li Hao was speechless. He could only say,"don't try this!"Failing to scare her, he could only continue,""You gather life and death, and I'll cut down your stars. I'll fuse the Dao of life and death into the river of time! I originally wanted to enjoy the new heaven alone, but life and death are difficult to comprehend. You're lucky to summon life and death ... In that case, you can fuse with my new Dao!"Lin Hongyu smiled. A star gradually appeared in her body. At this moment, the star was extremely complicated. It was half black and half white."Li Hao, why is the Dao of life and death different from my neo martial art's Dao of yin and yang? "Heaven's Fate couldn't help but ask."Yin and yang are yin and yang, life and death are life and death!"Li Hao continued to slash the stars and said,""I don't know what the new martial art Yin Yang is. My Dao is that life and death are related to time. The past is life and the future is death. Now, life and death converge, converging the past and the future ..." Heaven's Fate had a headache.Li Hao didn't continue. He just looked at the sky and then at second cat."Thank you, senior cat! I thought that senior would help me devour a little when the lightning strikes. I didn't expect you to use such a method to isolate heaven and earth ... It's half virtual and half real, and it feels like the great Dao universe!"He didn't hide it, as if he knew that second cat would help him devour the lightning.As expected! At that moment, Lin Hongyu cursed again in her heart. This heartless man had even included the cat in his plan.Second cat was a little lazy and didn't speak.He only glanced at Li Hao, but his eyes ... Were filled with vicissitudes of life.Li Hao turned his head and glanced at second cat. He seemed to realize something and said,""If you find it boring, you can come to my new Sky and visit the past and the future before you find the blood Emperor. Although it's only an illusion, it can be a comfort!""But what about the past and the future?" second cat asked."Sure!"Li Hao nodded."However, they're all illusions. The past is one, and the future is endless ... Go against the past and go against the future! At all times, it consumes energy and lifespan. Senior doesn't care about lifespan or energy. Since you're resurrected, why don't you swim backwards and entertain yourself ...""Li Hao, don't mess around!"Heaven's Fate couldn't help but say.Li Hao laughed,"follow your heart!" The Dao was the heart! If senior cat wants to return to the past, why don't you swim against the flow of the river and return to the depths of your memories? if you want to leave, you can do so at any time. If you don't want to ... You can lie to yourself in the depths of your memories for the rest of your life. So what?""Who doesn't know that the past is already gone?"Li Hao said. Second cat nodded slightly and suddenly disappeared into the long river of spacetime.In an instant, he dove into the river and went against the current. He was a little sad."You look like him ... But you're not him. I know that I can't chase after him, but I ... Still want to see him!"Going against the flow, time flew!The cat gradually became illusionary. Under the celestial pole's crumbling gaze, the cat disappeared into the river as if it had gone to the end of the river and never returned!"Li Hao!"The celestial pole was about to collapse, F * ck!You actually ... Actually led second cat away.Li Hao sighed."Senior, it doesn't seem to be very happy. You and the blood Emperor resurrected it, but it might not be willing. It's very boring to live in Silver Moon now. Why don't you let it immerse itself in it? perhaps it'll get over it after some time!" If you've truly gotten over it, you'll naturally be able to walk out of it!"At this moment, at the end of the river of time, there seemed to be the sound of reading. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In that indistinctly, an illusionary figure seemed to appear. It was an endless illusionary figure. It was dressed in white clothes that didn't touch the dust. A cat was jumping and rolling around. Its tears fell like a bead curtain, rolling into the long river and flowing down with the current. There was only endless sorrow and loneliness."AI!"Li Hao sighed."People like us. These things. Who says that we want to live long?"These words were said to er Mao, Lin Hongyu, and perhaps even to himself.If possible, I also want to go against the current and return to the past. I want to immerse myself in that illusory world and live in my own memories.BOOM!The stars were all shattered, leaving only the stars of time between his brows.

2497 Chapter 415
Stepping out of the world, Li Hao reached out his hand, and a life and death Star appeared. He raised his sword and said,""If this star shatters ... You'll have no way out!"Lin Hongyu looked at the end of the river of time and suddenly laughed,""I want the future, I don't want to live in the past! I'll follow whatever I get ... I'll accept it!"Li Hao's head was in a mess. The momentary loneliness he felt earlier instantly disappeared, leaving behind only endless worries.Women ... Are really ... Unreasonable!The sword slashed down!Without any hesitation, in an instant, the aura of life and death filled the entire River. Lin Hongyu's black and white colors changed. The original lifeless aura turned into a vibrant life in an instant.It kept changing back and forth, and it was a little painful.After an unknown period of time, the aura of death and vitality in his body dissipated. He was now like an ordinary person, without the slightest feeling of a cultivator.Li Hao, on the other hand, took a deep breath and looked at the sky after breaking the stars.""Today, Feng Changhe breaks the stars, combines life and death, and enters the ninth level of Dao integration!"BOOM!A tree, a seal, a tree in the river, taking root for thousands of miles.The seal turned into a barrier and covered the river. In the blink of an eye, a long river was completely formed like a tunnel!Li Hao's aura instantly solidified!Ninth level of the Dao integration realm!360 stars!The peak of the ninth level of the Dao integration realm was actually only the peak of the half-step sovereign realm.However, Heaven's Fate's expression changed slightly. He looked at Li Hao and suddenly said,""Ninth level of Dao integration ... A true peak half-step sovereign?"Li Hao turned his head, smiled, and nodded.""It can be considered so!"  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  What was the true peak of half-step sovereign?The previous half-step sovereigns didn't have the support of the origin, and Shi Gu sovereign didn't have the support of Hong Yue's great Dao of the universe, so he couldn't be considered a true sovereign or half-step sovereign.Of course, this was how Silver Moon counted.Li Hao, on the other hand, had reached the ninth level of Dao integration in a day. Although he was a peak half-Emperor, his current strength was no weaker than that of Shi Gu Emperor, who had broken out of the seal, and Li daoheng, who was an Emperor.This was a true ninth level Dao integration cultivator!Heaven's Fate was speechless and helpless. My second cat ... Is lost!Li Hao had actually reached the true ninth level of Dao integration. Strictly speaking, he could be a venerable sovereign in Silver Moon, and he could not even defeat him!How am I going to get second cat back?Really ... I'm so angry!If she had known earlier, she wouldn't have protected him. At this moment, the air of death completely dispersed in the sky, but the chaos lightning tribulation that Lin Hongyu and the others were afraid of did not come. Li Hao smiled and said,""It's fine. The new heaven is sealed. I won't leave the Silver Moon. Even chaos won't find out anything in a short time."If another Primal Chaos lightning tribulation really came, he would want to cry."Are you still God's will?" Lin Hongyu suddenly asked."No, it's not." Li Hao shook his head."The will of the heavens is already dead. I'm opening a new Sky. How can it still be the will of the heavens?""Then ... Are you considered a human?"“……”Li Hao was stunned. After a while, he nodded."I guess so.""That's good!"Lin Hongyu heaved a sigh of relief."I thought you weren't even human anymore."“……”Why did these words sound so awkward?"It seems easier than I thought. You only need to shatter a few stars and you've succeeded ..." Lin Hongyu continued.Li Hao smiled bitterly."If you think that going through two chaos lightning tribulations, venerable sovereign tribulations, and half-step sovereign tribulations in a row is not a tribulation, and that coming back from the dead is not a crisis, then I have nothing to say. It's indeed simple!""The great Dao will be formed naturally!"Lin Hongyu couldn't help but want to complain,""You ... Connect some Earth Qi. You're clearly not old, why are you becoming more and more mature? He's even more inhumane than senior Empyrean pole!"Heaven's Fate was unjustly implicated and felt very helpless.Li Hao, slightly dazed, nodded.""That makes sense. It's a little lacking in human touch. Perhaps ... We need an opportunity."Lin Hongyu did not say anything else. She knew that she needed an opportunity.Those who had died would return.Now that Yuan Shuo, hou Xiaochen, and the others were back, he might have some humanity left in him.On the side, Heaven's Fate also understood and suddenly sneered,""You two can have a child and it'll be more human!"In an instant, he felt a boundless sword intent lock onto him!Heaven's Fate cursed in his heart!You little brat, you dare to threaten me ... You're really not a good thing. You stole my cat, and I haven't even settled the score with you.It's a pity ... Forget it. Since my clone is no match for this fellow, I'll let him off for now.

Chapter 2498 A Sword Competition (1)
This resurrection could be said to be natural and logical.Even when the chaotic Thunder descended and the venerable sovereigns threatened him, Li Hao still had a plan in mind. No wonder he had been so calm and unhurried in the beginning, opening his Dao Meridian without any delay.He had used the crisis to resurrect Lin Hongyu, but Li Hao had easily resolved it.At this moment, the aura of death in the sky dissipated.The primal Chaos lightning did not strike again. As long as Li Hao didn't leave the Silver Moon, there wouldn't be much of a problem. But once he left the Silver Moon, it was very likely that he would be discovered and the primal Chaos lightning would strike again.He had successfully created his own little world.Even though it was far from the current Silver Moon, it was still his own territory.Anyone who could create a world like the Silver Moon was no ordinary venerable sovereign, but a top-notch venerable sovereign. The limits of the experts created by the creation of heaven and earth and those nurtured by heaven and earth were different.The one who created the world would definitely surpass the strong ones that were nurtured.For example, if a living being were to be born in Li Hao's small world, it would at most reach the Dao integration of the sun and moon. It would be impossible for it to reach the ninth level of the Dao integration. The long river would not be able to support the emergence of such an expert.Li Hao was quite relaxed.However, Heaven's Fate was not at ease at all. After teasing him, he said helplessly,""Will second cat be alright after entering your world?"He had really seen a ghost!I've been waiting for 100000 years and finally completed my mission."It's fine," Li Hao said softly."It's actually very special ... And I have some fate with it ..."  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Go to hell!"No!" Heaven's Fate was on high alert."Not anyone can take it away unless you want to challenge the blood Emperor, the human King, and Emperor Cang."The word 'fated' shocked him!Li Hao laughed,"you misunderstood!" The fate I'm talking about is ... Its uniqueness. It's not formed by the power of time, but it's related to time. It originates from the past and the future, and it exists in an uncertain projection space ... It involves many complicated things. ""Zhan Tiandi ... Is he really dead?" Li Hao couldn't help but ask."He's dead!"Celestial pole was certain and nodded,'he's really dead! He doesn't need to hide it. Death is death, life is life. If he wants to come back to life ... He could have lived back then. It's just that he feels that ... There's not much left in this world for him to miss. ""What a pity!"Li Hao sighed,'according to what you said, that dimension, the one where second cat and Zhan Tiandi lived ... Might have something to do with time! It's simply terrifying to be able to extract a fragment from a corner of the past and descend into the present world!""Just like now, I'm able to pull my past self out of the river and still exist ... I can't do such an action. Let alone now, even if I were much stronger, I wouldn't be able to do it."It was terrifying!In the past, he didn't understand. He only knew that it was an illusory small space. Now that he came into contact with time, he realized how terrifying it was! Although I'm dead, I've intercepted the past and fought against the heavens and earth again.It would be a pity ... For such a person to die.The human King and the others were strong, perhaps even stronger than that person, but ... At this moment, Li Hao felt that Zhan Tiandi was more interesting in the Dao discussion. His comprehension of Dao was simply unparalleled.This was a cultivator!Daoist cultivators were illusory.People like the human King were humans and not Daoists.Of course, they each had their own strengths, and it was hard to say who was good or bad. However, Li Hao was more inclined to pursue Zhan Tiandi, who had nothing to worry about in the world.What was the point of being immortal?Emperor Shi Gu had said that the Crimson Moon world had once invaded a major world and devoured the world Lord. The world Lord had resisted but chose to dissipate. There was no one in the world that was worth remembering. It was a torture to live on.This was actually what some elders thought. Li Hao was very young ... But deep down, he always wanted to jump out of it.Ever since his teacher and the others had died in battle, their desires had gradually been extinguished.If not for the fact that he still had a trace of concern and hoped to resurrect them, perhaps this time ... He would not have left behind that wisp of time power. The human heart was complicated, and he was even more complicated than everyone else.When celestial pole heard him say this, he nodded slightly.""That person is indeed very scary and powerful, so ... Don't even think about touching second cat.""It won 't. It's just at the end of the river, immersed in the past."Li Hao smiled."It knows what it's doing. Also, I'm a little confused. The blood Emperor resurrected it out of good intentions, but ... Zhan Tiandi is dead. Resurrecting it will only add to its troubles. What's the point?""Living is the meaning!"Li Hao shook his head.He didn't agree with celestial pole's words.For a cat that had lost its owner, a cat that had lost its owner that had accompanied it for thousands of years, to choose to live and die with its Owner at the last moment was actually what it was happy and hoped for.But now, he was resurrecting the other party ... People like the blood Emperor should not have done this."Is Zhan Tiandi coming back?"Li Hao asked, but Heaven's Fate shook his head.""How is that possible? Back then, he dissipated everything about himself into the world and integrated into neo martial. He handed it over to the human King and the blood Emperor. He will not return. ""Integrated into neo martial ..." Li Hao was stunned and suddenly said softly."Silver Moon was born in neo martial ..."He was stunned for a moment. He looked at the sky and muttered,""Could it be ... The energy source of the Silver Moon world actually comes from Zhan Tiandi?"Tian Ji was stunned and only replied after a long while,'it can't be, right? It's just the energy that simply flowed out of the new martial world. "

Chapter 2499 A Sword Competition (2)
"Energy that flows out at will can easily split open the heavens and earth? You can ... Forge the time great Dao?"Shi Guang had such a special Dao.It was born in a small world!As for heaven battling city, the fragments of the past had already vaguely involved time, but at the time of neo martial arts, there was no such concept.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly sighed.""Maybe the Silver Moon was formed from the power that Zhan Tiandi left behind. That's why the Silver Moon resurrected two cats, the blood Emperor. Maybe it's hope, but two cats always accompanied Zhan Tiandi."Celestial pole was stunned.Would he?Impossible!"You ..." He looked at Li Hao suspiciously.Did he say that on purpose to take second cat away?  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  ​ You control time, King of the Silver Moon. If this is the world of the Silver Moon, and it's really formed by the last of Zhan Tiandi's power after his death, then it's fine for you to take the two cats.But ... How could there be such a coincidence!Zhan Tiandi had died long ago.The power he had left behind had helped the human King and the blood Emperor ... Could it have helped Silver Moon?Li Hao said softly,"don't look at me like that. I'm not that shameless!" A small world that no one had taken the initiative to open could form its own world just by naturally losing power? Then there would be countless small worlds in this world!""I think the birth of the Silver Moon world has a high probability of being related to the last bit of power left behind by Zhan Tiandi. Otherwise, with the domineering character of the human King, how could he let the energy of the new martial art leak out?""That's for venerable the sword ..."Celestial pole frowned.Li Hao shook his head again."Venerable sword combined 10000 DAOs and 10000 DAOs returned to one. There's not much difference between devouring and not devouring. Of course, it can be explained this way. I'm just giving my opinion. It might not be right." I just feel that the blood Emperor's resurrection of the two cats is too sudden. Even if I can't bear to part with it, I shouldn't have taken it away from Zhan Tiandi ... It's too selfish to be alone. "Selfish?Was resurrecting it selfish?Heaven's Fate was speechless. He didn't want to die anyway, and it was good to be alive.They didn't quite agree with some of Li Hao's theories.However, on second thought, Li Hao's speculation was not completely unreasonable. Did that mean that the energy source of the Silvermoon world actually came from Zhan Tiandi?As if he had thought of something, he suddenly said,""The neo martial world is divided into yin and yang. The yin realm has actually appeared long ago, but no one discovered it. Only Zhan Tiandi did!"The human King was actually pulled out from the underworld by Zhan Tiandi.So ... This meant that Zhan Tiandi had already comprehended yin and yang! In that era, only Zhan Tiandi had discovered this.Later on, through some means left behind, the human King was created.Li Hao nodded, not surprised at all.""He can cut out fragments of the past. Naturally, he can separate yin and yang, and determine life and death."Heaven's Fate opened his mouth and said after a long while,""You're right, I didn't think about this. ""I don't care about that. Second cat doesn't belong to you!"“……”I don't care what you say. Anyway, second cat doesn't belong to you!He continued,"Emperor Cang's projection is here. You've seen it for yourself. Emperor Cang invited er Mao to eat dried fish ... Even though Emperor Cang is forgetful, if you take er Mao away, you might face the pursuit of Emperor Cang!"Think carefully before you speak!Li Hao laughed,"why did I take second cat away?" It swam against the flow of the river and returned to the past ...""Emperor Cang is unreasonable!"Celestial pole shook his head,'it's useless for you to tell me! Emperor Cang was unreasonable. If it was reasonable ... It would not be Emperor Cang! Anyway, if you want to take second cat, it's up to you. You can think about it!"Lin Hongyu chuckled at the side.""I won 't. Senior celestial pole, don't worry ... I just want to ask, this Emperor Cang ... How strong is he?"Heaven's Fate wanted to roll his eyes.Why, ask around and see if you can do something?What was he thinking!"How strong is he? Let's put it this way ... In neo martial arts, there was almost no distinction at the level of venerable sovereigns. After all, it did not make much sense. However, there was indeed a difference between the strong and the weak among venerable sovereigns! For example, the powerful ones like the heavenly Emperor could easily defeat five top venerable sovereigns. The human King killed the heavenly Emperor, and the human king and emperor Cang shared their power, so their strength was equal ... All of this happened during the last battle of new martial!""Top venerable sovereigns refer to the Supreme level, which is Zhang an's grandfather and the others.""Below the Supreme-being level are the levels of my father and the others, the old-school nine emperors and four Emperors ...""After that, it's venerable sword and the other venerable sovereigns.""After that, it's our group. We're all slightly weaker. For example, me, the human King, the underworld King Sword, and the others ...""Then, there are some weaker ones like King Huai, who are even weaker than me. There are also some venerable sovereigns in star suppression city ..."Lastly, there are the inferior venerable sovereigns from li Fuhai's father's generation. For example, his father's strength is unremarkable, and there's also the half-demon subduing envoy, the half-Emperor cat tree ..."He looked at Li Hao."This last batch is probably on par with the bone corrosion Emperor. The power that bone corrosion Emperor displayed earlier was only after he was weakened and lost the great Dao of the Crimson Moon world. He definitely wouldn't be this weak at his peak!" He said. I'm even stronger than you are now ..."In other words, even Li Hao at this moment was not as good as the bone erosion at his peak. In new martial arts, the weakest venerable sovereigns were not even as good as the half-emperors of that era.
