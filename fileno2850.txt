The few of them chatted for a while, but they were still very unfamiliar with each other.Even though Li Hao and Kong Ji were actually very familiar with each other, it wasn't to the extent that they didn't even meet each other often.But at this moment, they were chatting quite harmoniously.The sword Saint really liked the two young men!This time, he wasn't called a little fool, because these two young men were very eager to learn. They eagerly wanted to help him dig holes and work, and they eagerly wanted to go Rob with him ... Well, he would go Rob, and these two didn't even mention a share of the profit.If it was someone else ... Heh, they would have broken their heads long ago!Thinking back, which battle didn't end with a share of the spoils?If we don 't, will I listen to your nonsense for half a day?What a good person!There were still many good people in the chaos.Silver moon's appearance is just like mine, more imposing.Look, he had killed a seventh level venerable sovereign, but these two had not mentioned it until now. If it were someone with the surname Qin, he would have turned the sky upside down if he had not split the loot.If the two of them didn't mention it, he would feel embarrassed to not mention it.Seeing that the cave was almost opened and the base was almost ready, venerable the sword said,""I killed that so-called awakening God venerable Emperor ... He was a seventh-stage venerable Emperor after all. Although he wasn't the master of a great world and there were no great worlds or great Dao universes to divide, the Dao accumulation and great Dao energy of a seventh-stage venerable Emperor were all precious treasures!"Killing this type of rank-7 was actually far less valuable than killing a major cosmos absolute being.That's what a rich man is!However, it was also very unusual.Moreover, seventh rank venerable sovereigns had some wealth on them. The wealth of venerable sovereigns was usually not stored in storage rings, but in their Taoist connotation and Dao marks. For example, Hong Yue had a seventh rank Dao mark and Dao origin.Other things aside, the other party definitely had a great Dao crystal.However, they didn't take a closer look and ran away after taking everything. As for the exact amount of wealth, they had to check it out first.When it came to sharing the treasures ...Lonely void wasn't really interested, even if the other party was at the seventh step.Li Hao was actually very interested, but he did not say much. This was because the venerable sword in front of him was the king of Silver moon's previous generation and a peak neo martial artist. He was the main force in killing a stage seven.Even if he couldn't kill his opponent this time, he could still escape. Therefore, it was thanks to venerable sword that he was able to kill his opponent. No matter how much Li Hao borrowed the strength of his opponent, he still couldn't kill Li Hao and Kong Ji.There were also many other factors, so Li Hao didn't say much.This was the first time he had truly come into contact with a neo martial artist. He also wanted to see, judge, and measure it.Just because Silver Moon originated from neo martial did not mean that one could trust neo martial one hundred percent.The reputation of a neo martial artist ... Was not easy to say.Venerable the sword glanced at the two of them and smiled without saying a word.It was easy to talk about loneliness, but he was an authentic rich second generation. This kind of rich second generation did not lack money. In Li Hao's case, even neo martial artists were poor. Silver Moon, who originated from neo martial artists, would only be even poorer. Silver Moon was not a macro world rich in resources. Venerable the sword, who had been in charge of Silver Moon for many years, knew Silver moon's situation very well.It was already a miracle that Li Hao could reach the fourth step.Under normal circumstances, in a place like silver Moon 's, which was a remote and poor place, it was already very impressive for someone to be able to reach tier two or three after emerging from the primordial chaos."I'm here to take a look at the harvest!"For venerable sovereigns, the gains were nothing more than those things.Venerable the sword examined it for a moment, and a Red Moon-like object appeared in his hand. It was the remnant of the Taoist connotation of the other party."Seventh-grade Dao accumulation crystals...Well, quite a few. After killing a seventh-grade venerable sovereign, his Dao accumulation condensed after his death. You should know this, right?"Kong Ji and Li Hao nodded.A Dao accumulation crystal was different from a great Dao crystal.The other contained great Dao inspirations, such as the dark Dao accumulation crystals. Li Hao had obtained many of them in the dark Demon Ridge, and great Dao crystals were made of pure energy.There was a huge difference in value between one with insights and the other without.The higher the grade of the Tao accumulation crystal, the more valuable it was.This kind of seventh rank venerable sovereign's Dao accumulation crystal that was born after being killed was even more valuable. For many venerable sovereigns, they did not have many opportunities to listen to the powerhouses 'Dao discussions. The Dao accumulation crystal was the only treasure that they could gain some enlightenment from."Thousands of Dao crystals ... Not bad!" Venerable the sword calculated for a moment and said quickly,""Dao accumulation crystals are very valuable. In some worlds, a Level-7 Dao accumulation crystal can be exchanged for at least hundreds of thousands of Dao crystals! Ten million great Dao crystals can be exchanged for a small world ..."In other words, the Dao accumulation crystal alone could be exchanged for dozens of small worlds.It was actually very normal.What was a small world?Venerable sovereigns could only hold on to the power of a third-rank venerable sovereign, and a Dao accumulation crystal could only be born by a high-level venerable sovereign. Killing a seventh-rank venerable sovereign in exchange for dozens of small worlds was better than killing dozens of third-rank venerable sovereigns ... In fact, in most small worlds, the world Lords were only first or second-rank, and there were very few third-rank ones.Killing a high-stage venerable sovereign in exchange for a small world ... What an idiot would do.What he could do was not to care about the small world.Those who cared about the small world actually couldn't do it."Great Dao crystals, yes ... Quite a few. The other party had a lot to begin with. After his death, the power of the great Dao condensed into great Dao crystals. I don't know exactly how many, but there are at least a few hundred million."After venerable the sword finished speaking, he laughed.I'm rich!It was still worth it to kill a rank seven.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  A seventh rank venerable sovereign!It was his first time killing one.However, such a small gain was a huge loss to many people. Killing a Grade 7 just for this?

However, they were enemies. Even if they didn't gain anything, they still had to kill them."There are many other things. I took a look, eh ... There's a small world in the Dao mark ... A compressed small world."He saw a small world that was directly contained in the other party's Dao marks.A small world was actually useless to a high-level venerable sovereign. It was probably reserved for rewarding people.A small world was only useful to some low-level venerable sovereigns.As Li Hao and Kong Ji listened, Li Hao felt that he had gained a lot, but Kong Ji didn't feel much. Having reached level six, he didn't lack resources. What he lacked was the perception and understanding of the great Dao.It was useless to say all this to this rich second generation.Just his source of light alone was worth more than a small world. He could even trade it for a medium-level world, and a medium-level world was worth ten times more than a small world.For many rank five and six venerable sovereigns, instantly recovering the power of their great DAOs was more powerful than a medium-level world.Venerable the sword looked at it and said,""These are the only things that are valuable. There are also some miscellaneous things that aren't worth much and are of no use to us! Ordinary high level venerable sovereigns don't carry those things with them. ""I'll take it as 300000 great Dao crystals for one! "1000,300 million great Dao crystals. The other party left behind about 200 million after his death. The small world will be counted as 10 million great Dao crystals. Other than that, there are 510 million.""This time, we'll kill that guy, and the three of us will put in the same amount of effort ... Let's split it equally!"" 170 million crystals per person. That's enough to buy almost two medium-level worlds. Not bad!"He laughed. In fact, it was not worth it.He could easily destroy two medium-level worlds by himself, so it was not too dangerous.But in reality...He wasn't a murderer who could casually destroy a medium-level world he captured.From this, it could be seen that the red moon had offered a reward. If they captured the Silvermoon world, they could exchange it for a medium-level world. It was no wonder that countless cultivators were tempted.Kong Ji wanted to say something, but Li Hao said,""Brother kongji, take it. Just treat it as a loss! You consumed a lot of energy to teleport here, and the origin of light is very valuable. Don't reject the good intentions of the venerable swordsman!"Kong Ji thought for a while, nodded, and didn't say anything.That was true.The consumption this time was huge. He had actually used countless Dao crystals to teleport here.However, he wasn't very interested in the Dao crystal. He thought for a while and said,""Can you give me some more Dao accumulation crystals? I'm quite interested in the Dao of the Crimson Moon. It can arouse the primitive desires in people's hearts and stimulate the origin of our great Dao. I've underestimated the Crimson Moon in the past. I always thought that the cultivators of the Crimson Moon world only knew how to flirt, but this time, I feel that this ability is very abnormal. ""Sure, no problem!" Venerable the sword nodded.He chuckled."I'm not that interested in Hong Yue's Dao. Besides, Hong Yue is our enemy. We have plenty of opportunities to kill their experts! Li Hao, what about you? What do you want?""Small world, great Dao crystal, part of the Dao accumulation crystal."Venerable the sword raised his eyebrows slightly."Good boy, you don't mind anything. You don't refuse anything." ​ In fact, he also wanted a small world.A small world was nothing, but for a cultivator like him, he could study the structure of a small world and study the different systems of the great Dao. Other cultivators did it to devour, but he did not.As for Li Hao, he didn't want to devour it. He had the same idea as venerable the sword.Other than that, once he was done with his research, he could let the Silvermoon world devour it without wasting it. Although the Silvermoon world was in the great Dao universe, the Heaven's Will representative, the Black Panther, was still outside.Black Panthers could be devoured.Venerable the sword thought about it. This was their first time working together. Forget it, let's just leave it at that.This was the first time he had been so stingy, and the two of them had looked down on him. What if they were not willing to cooperate in the future?  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  "Okay, then I'll give you a small world, 40 million great Dao crystals, and 400 Dao accumulation crystals. What do you think?"Li Hao nodded and smiled.Sure enough, killing and setting fire were golden belts!What was a Dao crystal?A level one venerable sovereign could only condense 300 or so in a year. Just the harvest this time was enough for the other party to condense for hundreds of thousands of years.Hundreds of thousands of years, how long was that?"I'll give you 500 Taoist connotation crystals and 20 million great way crystals. I'll take the rest. Do you have any objections?" venerable the sword looked at Kong Ji and smiled.Kong Ji nodded indifferently.It was pretty good!Venerable the sword was also happy. Since that was the case, there was no problem.That's good!The Dao accumulation crystal, a seventh-rank venerable sovereign, or venerable Red Moon sovereign ... Was actually not of much use to him. He would leave 100 of them for him to study a little. He did not need to study them too deeply.On the other hand, the great Dao crystals were still useful to him. They were useful for his cultivation, for giving back to the neo martial arts 'origin universe, or for improving the strength of the great Dao of the neo martial arts' world.Li Hao was leaving the small world, so he didn't bother to say anything.The loot was easily divided.Venerable the sword continued,"killing a level Seven of this kind of macro world ... I mean non-world Lord, actually, the harvest is not big!" It's a great harvest to really kill the Lord of a great world. The world itself, the great Dao universe, all kinds of great Dao crystals, and the Dao accumulation crystals ... This is truly rich!"A great Dao universe could not be bought with money.

There were people who traded mid-tier worlds, but no one had ever heard of anyone trading high-tier worlds.Soon, Li Hao got his harvest.Feeling the river that was full of rewards ... Li Hao was also very satisfied.With so many Dao crystals, it would be enough for his cultivation.At the very least, he didn't have to constantly worry about running out of energy in his cultivation.As for the Dao accumulation crystal, it would be good to comprehend it.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Seventh level venerable sovereigns all had their merits.Even if he didn't need it, he thought of Qian Wuliang, who was cultivating the path of void and the path of desire of the Crimson Moon. There were some similarities between them. He might be able to gain something from it.The Silvermoon people still had to become stronger on their own!Just look at new martial.Were human Kings powerful?It was very powerful!However, there was no Supreme, no sword Saint, no sun god, no Emperor Cang ...Without the support of these neo martial artists, the human King might have been killed by others.But now, why wasn't there any?This was because the existence of these people could save their lives at critical moments. They could provide sufficient support to the human King. If the human King made a move, the Supreme martial artist and the others would make a move on the other side. This was their confidence!And silver Moon ...Li Hao sighed in his heart. The Silvermoon people were too young.Neo martial was also young, but it had more or less developed for more than a thousand years.It was a great world to begin with, but Silver Moon was not even a small world at the beginning. It was not easy for it to produce so many venerable sovereigns. But now, Li Hao had just entered the intermediate level, and it would be difficult for others to do so.Currently, the two Dao Masters in the Silvermoon world had a lot of potential to be discovered.The other one was black Panther.As the Heaven's Will, as the sector Lord of the Silvermoon world, the world's growth would also help the Black Panther's growth.These three all had the chance to quickly cross some barriers.However, for the others ... It was very difficult.The Silvermoon people who were stranded in tianfang world, including Lin Hongyu who had taken root in her own River, had a difficult time advancing. There were also a number of new martial artists ... Like li Fuhai and the others who had followed skysword and the others to tianfang world.Only Zhang an, who was with Lin Hongyu and the others, did not stay there."What are you thinking about?"Venerable the sword asked with a smile when he saw that Li Hao seemed to be deep in thought. Li Hao raised his head and looked at venerable the sword. He said softly,""I'm not thinking about anything. I just feel that I, Silver Moon, am too poor and weak. I don't know when I'll be able to produce a powerful cultivator like uncle li. "Silver Moon!Venerable the sword nodded his head slightly and thought for a while before saying,""Silvermoon still has potential. Of course, he's not a great world, but he has his own great Dao universe. This is an opportunity and a Foundation!""In addition, the Silvermoon people all have some talent in cultivation.""The Silver Moon is a world where Daoist techniques are born ..." He sighed.Li Hao glanced at him, and venerable the sword said meaningfully,""You understand?"Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded."I kind of understand. It's just that ... That person was only at the sixth step back then. I'm just a little curious. Is he really that invincible and talented?"Sword Saint sighed and said,""I don't know. I'm not from the same era as him. I've only seen him once ... Just once! "That was the him who died many years later. He wasn't even himself, just a remnant. He came to neo martial, looked around, and then left. He dissipated and Went with the Wind!""Fang ping ... Is the human King. He's the reason why he's where he is today. He's also the reason why yin and yang were created!""It's a pity ... He's dead!"Venerable the sword shook his head with mixed feelings. Or rather, it's not a pity. In his eyes, perhaps our thoughts are the childish ones! What's the point of living so long? No matter how long a vulgar person lives, he can only Live!"Vulgar?Venerable the sword, a top level Seven cultivator, actually said that he was vulgar!Even Kong Ji was stunned. He looked at the two of them. Who were they talking about?In his eyes, Li Hao and venerable the sword were probably the most talented people he had ever seen. There were too few people like them!In their eyes, was there anyone more outstanding? Li Hao nodded."Perhaps it's just as uncle Li said. In his eyes, we're all very vulgar!"Venerable the sword laughed,"if it's vulgar, then it's vulgar. Just live your own life!" "If I may be a little disrespectful, I feel that the late-nascent Soul Stage cultivator might have been too lonely and thought too much. He didn't have any friends, family, or thoughts, so he chose to go with the wind. "He's not like us ordinary people who still have concerns. He's a person who stands too high and sees too far. It's too cold at the top. He's in a realm where he's lonely and seeks defeat. If he doesn't die, he'll be too lonely!""Who is it?"Kong Ji couldn't help but think,"there's still someone who would give such an evaluation in front of you. It's not simple."He's dead?Someone from the neo martial world?He knew a little about the neo martial world. The biggest villain, the celestial Emperor, was only at the peak of the sixth rank. He might not be more powerful than the current sword venerable. At most, he was on par with him."A person from the past."Venerable the sword laughed and patted Kong Ji,""You don't need to know all this, young man. You have to understand that the more you know, the more disappointed you will be in yourself. Why do you have to get to the bottom of it?"“……”Somehow, Kong Ji felt that something was different.He looked at venerable the sword and patted himself again and again with an indescribable helplessness.He was the son of the God of Light. He was high and mighty no matter where he was. Even if he had left home and come to the Hui long temple, he was still a middle-stage venerable sovereign.

2853 Chapter 470
After meeting Li Hao, he had a new friend, but they were of the same generation.Li Hao was a bit weaker than him, but Li Hao still respected him to a certain extent.However, this person ... Was only a few years older than him. Among venerable sovereigns, could a gap of two to three hundred years be called a gap?It can 't!Being friends of the same generation was already giving face.But ... This person seems to really think of himself as a junior. We're both at the sixth step!The age difference wasn't big.However...In front of this person, I really do feel a little empty. I feel like I've met an elder, and I feel a little helpless. My father is a million years old. Which of the venerable sovereigns of our divine light plane isn't older than me?He didn't even feel this way.Perhaps it was the casual attitude of the sword venerable ... How could he not be familiar with it? he kept patting people's shoulders, which made people feel helpless.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Venerable the sword didn't think there was anything wrong with it.This is Li Hao's friend, Li Hao ... If he's a descendant of the Li family, then he's from his bloodline. Who knows how many generations of descendants he's from? I can't be bothered to calculate, so I'll have people call him senior. If I really do, Li Hao ... Isn't even the grandson of the grandson of the grandson of the grandson of the grandson of the grandson.Well, he didn't have a grandson.Since he was Li Hao's friend, he was also his junior.After a brief conversation, venerable the sword started to plan again,""Let's get down to business. My goal is very clear. I want to open my realm, open my Dao, and integrate my Dao. I may not open the sky or open my realm. Therefore, I need a large number of great Dao crystals and the comprehension and structure of the great Dao universe ... As well as sufficient reserves to meet the energy requirements for my advancement!""Crimson Moon is my new martial artist's enemy. Next, I'll definitely kill a group of Crimson moon's allies ... I won't pretend to be aloof when it comes to resources. No, I definitely want them. I'll have to calculate it clearly first!"Just as Kong Ji was about to speak, venerable the sword interrupted him,""It's your business if you have money. Let's not talk about whether you want it or not. I said I'll give you 20%. I just want to ask you, what goal do you want to achieve?""Level Seven?" Kong Ji was stunned."Enter Level Seven!""This is too general!"Venerable the sword shook his head,"you have to split up your target. Your target is space!" You can say that you want to comprehend Nirvana ... For example, if you want to destroy a world and your goal is to destroy this world, we will cooperate with you to complete your goal and not kill people for the sake of killing ...""Even if the difficulty increases and it's more complicated than just killing, we can still give priority to your needs." Kong Ji's heart moved.At this moment, he suddenly felt that something was different. It was really different. Before this, he only wanted to integrate with them and try a different experience, to be a Bandit ...However, revered sword could not be considered a Bandit.Or perhaps ... He felt like a teacher? This person ... The outside world said that he was the teacher of the human King. Could it be that he was also taught this way?Kong Ji was a little cautious. He didn't know why he had this feeling. In front of a rank seven, he could still remain calm. At this moment, he thought for a moment before saying,"As senior said, I do have such an idea. I don't like to kill people for no reason, and I don't want to kill people for no reason ... What I mean is, if there is such an opportunity, I want to destroy a world ... And then try to revive it!""Of course, there might be some accidents. The world might be completely destroyed and can't be revived ... That would be killing. Of course, if that's the case, I'm not a good person either. However, it would be more difficult than destroying a world!""Sure!" Venerable the sword laughed.Can I?Kong Ji didn't say anything. It was inappropriate to make such a request in the enemy's abdomen.Killing people was actually very simple.However, Nirvana ... The slightest mistake could easily lead to a huge change. Killing someone could be done with a single sword strike, but Nirvana might not succeed.Venerable the sword didn't care about this. He looked at Li Hao.Li Hao said,"first, I want resources. Second, I want to understand the structure of the great DAOs. Only the great worlds have them! "Third, the revival of Nirvana. I'm also comprehending it. What the void seeks is also what I seek! In addition, I want to kill people and comprehend life and death ..."Venerable the sword thought for a while and nodded,"that works!" Do you have any other requests?"Li Hao shook his head.Venerable the sword laughed,"it seems that you two don't have high expectations. It's okay!" Then, the three of us know our limits and have a general common goal. That's enough!""We still have things to do next!"Venerable the sword said,"one is not enough!" A cunning rabbit has Three Burrows. We still have to be more careful. We have to dig hundreds of holes along the periphery of the Crimson Moon world! Contact the entire Crimson Moon world and let them kill their way here. We can escape without a trace and they won't be able to catch us!""This is a lot of work, and it's hard for me to do it alone. From today on, you two will learn digging skills with me!"The two of them looked at each other and nodded.It was just unpleasant to hear.In reality, it was a technique to construct the foundation of the world and the comprehension of Dao. Under normal circumstances, one would not even be able to learn it.As for manual labor ... He couldn't even think of how many venerable sovereigns there were. It was useless to think about it, and venerable sword wouldn't teach everyone."Other than digging, there are a few more things to do."Venerable the sword pointed them out one by one."Collect information. Know yourself and know your enemy. Mainly information about the few macro worlds. Kong Ji, you are from the divine light plane. Do you have some basic information?"Kong Ji nodded.

"Good. Give it to Li Hao and me. I want this information!""Your layered backtrack is time?" he looked at Li Hao.Li Hao nodded."Time ..."Venerable the sword thought for a while and shook his head,"don't use it for the time being!" It's not just time. Be it life or death, or Nirvana or resuscitation ... Don't fuse them together and use them. Once you do, you'll be struck by tribulation lightning!""The descent of the lightning tribulation actually means that you haven't fused enough and can't be as one!"Venerable the sword explained,"back then, Fang Ping's yin and yang were not integrated enough. When he used the Dao of yin and yang integration, he easily provoked the chaos lightning tribulation. Later on, he got better and would not be struck by lightning easily because his yin and yang integration was very high. At this point, the chaos lightning tribulation would not target you anymore. Unless you revive yourself with yin and yang, it would be a normal Dao technique!"He looked at the two of them and said,"the appearance of the chaos lightning tribulation means that your identity has been exposed. Moreover, you don't have to always use one Dao. Since you both have the heart to cultivate 10000 DAOs, you should try different DAOs! You can't be proficient in it, but you have to use it. Only after using it will you have some different insights!"Li Hao considered it for a while. It made sense. He nodded in agreement.The time Dao could not be used recklessly.Previously, he had overdrawn too much.The sword Saint had obviously seen through some of the disadvantages, or it could be said that he had already known where the disadvantages were."Also, the three of us don't have to act together!"Venerable the sword said,"maybe we need some cover!" "For example, I'll make a move here, and you'll make a move somewhere else. Sometimes, we need someone to act as bait to divert our attention, create a diversion, and so on! It's very dangerous ... Can you two do it?"The two of them nodded. Of course, they could.The sword Saint laughed again.Not bad!After Fang ping left, his strength was outstanding. When he cooperated with a rank-7, the other party was not willing to bring him along to play. When he cooperated with an ordinary venerable sovereign ... The other party could not cooperate with him. In any case, it was very uncomfortable to cooperate.Now, it was not bad.Both of them had their own unique points.If they worked together, they might be able to gain something.His goal was also very clear, which was to quickly reach Level Seven. The red moon region was his chance."That's it, then. Let's dig a hole first. Let's not talk about anything else. Our first target ... The forest great world!"Venerable the sword grinned. Kong Ji glanced at him. Li Hao seemed to have done the same. Of course, all new martial artists seemed to have this habit. When they smiled, it was brilliant ... But it also seemed hypocritical and scary.It was said that neo martial human Kings often did the same.When he saw that venerable the sword was about to move, he said,""Senior, this time we killed Xing Shen. The world of light ..." "Don't worry about it!"Venerable the sword frowned and said,"don't worry about this mess!" That's not something you should care about, and it's also not something I should care about. It doesn't matter if your identity is exposed or not. Let them care about these things themselves. Isn't your father more sensible than you? Zhang Tao was also in charge of new martial arts! We don't need to worry about the bigger picture ... Because we are not paragons!""As a part of the world, you need to consider the world's survival and future at critical times. However, since there are still people who make decisions, as long as you don't betray the world, as for causing trouble ... That's your own business! Red Moon isn't stupid. She wouldn't offend the world of light for you. "Then, he looked at Li Hao.Li Hao chuckled."I'm fine. Silver Moon is very weak. Besides ... He's already locked in with neo martial, so Red Moon won't let us go. It doesn't matter."Sword Saint nodded. That was true.He didn't ask Li Hao where he had hidden the world of Silvermoon. There was no need to ask.Since he had left the Silver Moon, he did not think of himself as the Silver Moon King.That place ... Now belonged to the Silvermoon people.Li Hao, on the other hand, was still thinking about Hong Yitang and the others."Uncle li, we still have a group of people nearby ...""It doesn't matter!"Venerable the sword was unconcerned,"with Heaven's Fate and King Huai around, these two guys who are afraid of death might not have any other abilities, but they do have the ability to hide!" Moreover, they were already venerable sovereigns, not children. Did he have to give them urine? After avoiding the greatest danger, they would try to survive in the chaos. That was enough! They're not dead yet, and as for the process, that's their own business. "Li Hao nodded again.Hearing him say this, he felt a little more at ease. That's right, Heaven's Fate and King Huai, these two were able to hang around in neo martial arts until now, they still had some ability.The original Li Hao had exhausted all his energy and considered many things.However, after interacting with venerable the sword, he had put aside some of his thoughts.,m The sword venerable would help perfect the plan. Unless something really went wrong, Li Hao felt that he didn't need to consider all this.He suddenly felt a little emotional!Some people ... It wasn't that they didn't want to think, but they didn't need to. The new martial artist human King was still very blessed. These people had helped him perfect his various plans. The human King was definitely not an idiot. An idiot wouldn't have made it to this day.However, the human King seemed to rarely consider other miscellaneous things. He only needed to know a little. If they were his enemies, he would kill them. If he could kill them, he would kill them. If he couldn 't, he would run!There was no need to consider other things!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ From Silver moon's time until now, he had been racking his brains every time. He had to consider the consequences, the future, and even silver moon's future.Now, the Silver Moon world was in the universe of the great path, and Lin Hongyu and the others had joined with Tian Ji and the others. He was the weakest in the group of three, but the two of them were not idiots, especially venerable the sword. He seemed to be very familiar with the chaos.

With such a person around, he didn't need to think about anything."Let's go!"Venerable the sword did not say anything more and brought the two of them to a new location.A cunning rabbit had Three Burrows. It would not fit his idea if he did not make a few hundred holes.While these two kids were not tired of it and could still work, he should finish this work as soon as possible.Li Hao and Kong Ji were obviously very happy to do so.……At the same time.The Crimson Moon world.He looked down at the primordial chaos.A huge world stood in the chaos like a Red Moon. There were many worlds around the red moon. This was probably the region with the most worlds from the surrounding regions.Worlds of various sizes were densely packed in all directions.There were great worlds in the North, South, East, and West.The Dark Moon world, the endless sky World, the cangjiang world, and the Senlan world, which had lost their Dao master, were scattered around the Crimson Moon, protecting it.In order not to clash with each other, the major worlds had split up.With the Crimson Moon as the core, if there was a problem, the Crimson Moon would be able to rescue them in time.Near these large worlds, there were some medium-sized worlds and even some small worlds ... Whether it was a small world or a medium-sized world, they were difficult to move. These worlds had spent a lot of energy and even hired some chaos beasts to complete the migration.In the primordial chaos, chaos behemoths had the ability to accommodate worlds.And in the chaos, some chaos behemoths did not simply go to devour worlds. In order to not be surrounded and killed, they would also act as hired beasts and help some worlds migrate ... The premise was that the world was relatively strong. If it was too weak, it was normal to simply devour it while no one knew.Having more worlds was also a rare opportunity.As a result, the area around the Crimson Moon world was actually very lively.He had also come into contact with some venerable sovereigns.Even those below venerable sovereign had begun to try entering the primal Chaos. There were many experts in this place. Although the primal Chaos was terrifying, with an expert leading the way, they could safely pass through it.In order to facilitate communication, the Crimson Moon world had even built a medium-sized world next to the Crimson Moon for communication purposes. It was similar to the tianfang world.It was for experts from all over the world to enter and interact.Otherwise, rashly entering another world would be a provocation and a threat.Recently, Hong Yue had been injured, and several advanced venerable sovereigns had been killed. This had caused some tremors in the great worlds around Hong Yue. However, some small and medium-sized worlds might not have received the news yet.The square world used for the exchange, which was the medium world taken out by the red moon, was still very lively.People came and went, there were venerable sovereigns and there were also non-venerable sovereigns.In fact, many chaos Rangers had come over in the past few days.At the moment, a group of people was walking in the huge city. There were even some huge chaos beasts around.Hong Yitang and the others were on high alert.As for the timid King Huai and Heaven's Fate, they were carefree. They directly appeared here and walked around.This place was extremely close to the Crimson Moon world. However, Heaven's Fate and the others weren't too worried. The more dangerous a place was, the safer it was.Moreover, they had also heard that the seventh rank venerable sovereign had been killed.Even if Hong Yue wanted to interfere, she would not care about these small figures, but venerable the sword and the others.At that moment, King Huai sent a voice transmission,"don't be anxious. We'll gather some information here and then think of a way to sneak into the forest great world!" There have been many people trying to sneak in recently, and we're not the exception!""Although we're not very strong, we have a lot of people ... Even a middle-stage venerable sovereign won't dare to provoke us!""I saw some Red Moon cultivators around. Will they cause any trouble?" Lin Hongyu asked."It's alright!"King Huai explained with a voice transmission,"what's there to be afraid of, Red Moon cultivator?" Right now, they had suffered heavy losses with their tails between their legs! Moreover, if nothing unexpected happened, the red moon master would definitely have designs on the several major worlds to make up for his losses! He'd rather the other side be more chaotic so that they can ask for help and join the Crimson Moon world. Therefore, not only is the Crimson Moon not a threat, but it's also the key for us to infiltrate the Senlan world!" "The other party is eager for a large number of wandering cultivators to sneak into Senlan and create chaos! At that time, sector Lord Sen LAN can either escape with the world or ask for help from the Crimson Moon, leading the wolf into the house ... I'm familiar with this!""Let's look for the Crimson Moon cultivator directly ... I'm sure they'll have a way to help us sneak into the forest great world!"Lin Hongyu's eyes flickered and she nodded slightly without saying anything.She wasn't stupid, she was smart.However, this was her first official contact with chaos, and she was inexplicably nervous. Although King Huai rarely came out of neo martial, when he really came out, he felt like a wily old fox.King Huai was also rather polite to the Silver Moon cultivators.There was no other reason other than that he had won the bet!The level Seven venerable sovereign was dead, and venerable sword could not kill him alone. Clearly, the appearance of Li Hao and another cultivator had reversed the situation.This proved that he had made the right choice.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ What he and Heaven's Fate needed to do now was to make sure that the Silver Moon cultivators didn't die and that they would be safe until Li Hao and the others arrived.Senlan was very dangerous, but she was also very safe.He didn't dare to have any ideas about Senlan now, but he knew that if there was chaos in the end ... Senlan would most likely join the Crimson Moon.If they had an official identity in Senlan, they could even take the opportunity to integrate into the Crimson Moon world.In addition, such a macro world ... If the sword Saint had not left, he would probably have set his eyes on this place.At that time, it would also be convenient for them to meet up.It would even be convenient for him to seize this major world!"We'll just be the sentries ... Don't try to do anything. But if the Silver Moon King returns, we might be able to do something."He kept calling her the Silver Moon King in a very humble manner. He maintained a respectful attitude towards this junior.This made the red moon cultivators very satisfied.They all felt that the rumors about this person in neo martial arts were a little too much. Whether it was King Huai or Heaven's Fate, they were not notorious. These two were excellent neo martial's Supreme Emperor.Seeing this, King Huai's smile became even more brilliant.Now that he had completed the initial step of integration, all he had to do was lick ... Ahem, be friendly enough, and he would be able to smoothly integrate into Silver moon's small group.The others were easy to deal with, but Qian Wuliang, who was also a path master, didn't seem to be friendly to him.King Huai thought to himself.Qian Wuliang felt helpless.'This guy really knows how to suck up to people. He's a neo martial Supreme Emperor, the senior expert of the Silvermoon people. How can he be so shameless?'In the past, I was the one who did all this work.Now that this person had come, he suddenly felt a sense of crisis. If he didn't perform well ... Sooner or later, he would be replaced by this person. It was really miserable.The group did not stay for long. They quickly inquired about the situation and found a Red Moon cultivator. They secretly stuffed thousands of great Dao crystals into his hands. As King Huai had said, the red moon cultivator really had a way to help them smuggle into the forest great world.Soon, a group of people, including several other independent venerable sovereigns, began to sneak into Senlan under the arrangement of Hong Yue's side.Of course, they would not say to the outside world that it was the Crimson Moon world who did it. The expert behind the scenes was a powerful Chaos Beast.While Li Hao's group was frantically digging holes, this group of people had integrated into the forest great world.For a time, there were countless venerable sovereigns in the great world.There were originally many venerable sovereigns in the world. After all, it was a macro world. Although it was not as good as other Level Seven macro worlds, there were dozens of venerable sovereigns before. In a short time, Senlan had gathered more than 100 venerable sovereigns.That Senlan sector Lord's brain was about to explode.Under such circumstances, Li Hao's group's first target was this great world. They had dug many holes, and the last hole was near the forest great world.While Lin Hongyu and the others entered the Senlan great world, Li Hao and the others began to attack the last base outside the Senlan great world.At the same time.More venerable sovereigns from the tianfang world also gathered there.Even the divine light realm and the divine cloud realm were shifting their great worlds. It was as if they were trying to shift their great worlds over. Tian Fang and the Crimson Moon had become the focal point of the chaos at this moment.

Chapter 2856 The Embryonic Form Of The Myriad Realms (1)
Outside the forest orchid.In the last cave.The cave gradually began to stabilize. This time, instead of venerable the sword, Li Hao and Kong Ji took the lead and worked together. At the side, Sword Saint was happy.Sure enough, just as he had thought, these two people were good at work.Good job!After digging for about a month, the two of them could already make their own caves. Although it was not perfect, venerable the sword could free himself from it.It was a pity that he didn't bring any cigarettes.Otherwise, if he were to take a puff and carry a small leather whip in his hand, he would feel like a supervisor.In the cave, Li Hao let out a light breath. He had consumed a lot of energy.Kong Ji, who was stronger than him, felt that it was alright and that he had gained a lot.Li Hao stopped and exhaled again.After glancing at the unstable cave, Li Hao observed his own River. The river was still as chaotic as ever. He had actually tidied up this River many times.Each time, he would have different thoughts.This month, although it was called digging holes, it was actually tidying up and weaving the great Dao. It could be considered as learning from the neo martial seniors and re-understanding and constructing the great Dao.In the past month, Kong Ji had also talked to him about his comprehension of the Dao of destruction and revival.After a month, Li Hao had learned a lot about Dao.Venerable the sword was from neo martial arts, which had a seventh rank venerable sovereign. Venerable the sword himself was infinitely close to the seventh rank.Kong Ji was at the sixth step, but his father was at the eighth step, and he had even re-cultivated once.It could be said that the two people in front of him were the top of the Tier 6. Whether it was in terms of knowledge or understanding of the Dao, they were the top.Li Hao, on the other hand, had gotten up too quickly.Silver Moon himself lacked these things, including his own great path universe, which actually originated from venerable sword more than 50 years ago. In other words, the DAOs contained in the great path universe might not be comparable to that of venerable sword himself.As a result, Li Hao lacked systematic training methods and paths compared to them.Li Hao, who had entered level four, felt that it was increasingly difficult to comprehend Dao.The road ahead was a little confusing.Today, he had some enlightenment and had some thoughts of his own."Long river ... Heaven and earth ... World ..."He then looked at the stars. These stars were all carriers of the Dao.His development of the long river was still too low.The winding river was a fusion of Dao, but it hadn't been developed enough. At this time, Li Hao had some new ideas of his own. The efficiency of using the winding river was too low. It shouldn't be like this.His River of the great path was still very powerful, and the power of the great path was rich. However, every time they exchanged blows, the most he did with the winding river was to gather time!This was wrong!"Chaos, the weaving of Dao, the embryonic form of a world ...""Copy of chaos, co-existence of myriad worlds!"After taking a look at the cave he had just stabilized, Li Hao looked at venerable the sword and said,""If the two of you are not in a hurry, I would like to take a short rest and perfect some mantras. What do you think?""To cultivate?" venerable the sword laughed. We can ... But with the three of us here, we're too big a target. In any case, we need someone to be the vanguard, so why don't you cultivate here while we go first?"Senlan was easy to deal with, but Hongyue was difficult.He couldn't act rashly without making things clear. He wasn't the human King, who could run away after killing people. He had to be on guard against the red moon.It was normal that Li Hao wanted to cultivate and comprehend.He had just entered the fourth level and must have gained a lot of insight recently. Venerable the sword just reminded him,""Just don't attract the chaos lightning tribulation here. Otherwise, the commotion will be too great. This small cave might not be able to hide it!"Li Hao nodded."Then the two of you will go ahead first!""Are you going to reach Tier 5?" Kong Ji asked, confused.“……”Li Hao smiled bitterly. You really think highly of me. I've only just entered Level 4.How could it be so fast!Moreover, he might have to make some adjustments to his path to Tier 5, so how could he enter so quickly?This was Li Hao's advantage, but also his disadvantage.He didn't have any high-level cultivation methods. He had been walking step by step until now. He would only consider the path of the fifth step when he reached the fourth step. Kong Ji, on the other hand, could actually reach the seventh step with his eyes closed. Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to walk the path of light.It's fine as long as I press forward!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ However, Li Hao had to test himself step by step. If he took the wrong path, he might have to train again, even though he had just cleared his mind not long ago on the day he entered Level 4.However, after meeting venerable the sword, he realized that he might have some new ideas. He had to sort out a correct path again.It was not just for himself. Perhaps ... It was also for the Silvermoon people to build a foundation for their future cultivation.Seeing that he wasn't here to enter Tier 5, Kong Ji laughed,""I thought you were about to enter the fifth rank. If that's the case ... I'm starting to doubt my life."He now knew how old Li Hao was.After all, he was a son of the eighth step. If Li Hao was about to reach the fifth step, it would be very hurtful."Then, senior venerable the sword and I will go to Senlan to take a look ..."Senlan's Dao universe had been in turmoil once before. The master of the great Dao had died and the great Dao might be in a half-destroyed state now. The Senlan sector Lord was stabilizing and reviving the Senlan great Dao.This was an opportunity for Kong Ji.

Chapter 2857 The Embryonic Form Of The Myriad Realms (1)
The destruction and recovery of a great path universe was perfect for him to observe."Brother Hao Yue, we'll try our best to wait for you. If you still don't come ... Then we'll have to make the first move. Don't miss this opportunity.""I hope not!" Li Hao laughed.Venerable the sword chuckled when he saw the two of them being reluctant to part. It was a pity that these two were both men. Otherwise, he would have to find a matchmaker.Of course, a strange thought flashed through her mind. A man would do too ...In the next moment, he chuckled and said nothing more. Along with the empty world of Nirvana, the two of them left the cave and instantly disappeared into the vast chaos.……As for Li Hao, he waited for them to leave.He took out the long river, looked at the stars in the sky, and then looked at the surging River, and fell into deep thought.Er Mao didn't make a sound or show up when the sword Saint was around.Previously, when he had been dragged out by the Supreme Being's clone, he had been so angry that it seemed as if he had been angry all along.At this moment, he seemed to have recovered.Seeing that venerable the sword had left, he was a little dissatisfied,""Don't hang out with these people every day. They're all bad people, and they'll lead you astray! Big cat was led astray by them. Now, big cat is either killing people or catching fish. Big cat doesn't seem to be enlightened anymore. He just eats and sleeps and eats again ..."Aren't you the same?Li Hao chuckled.Second cat seemed to know what Li Hao was thinking and said,""I'm different ... After all, I'm not a real living being ...""Who said it wasn 't?" Li Hao said.Second cat didn't say anything.It wasn't the case to begin with.It said that Li Hao shouldn't have too much contact with the new martial artists, but it was actually a bit complicated. The new martial artists were strong, and Li Hao could gain more by interacting with them. There were also people who could protect Li Hao.But ... Li Hao had been with the neo martial artists all this time. The ability of the neo martial artists to assimilate was very strong!After a long time, the lone traveler and the seeker from before might eventually become an ordinary venerable sovereign living under neo martial.And second cat didn't want Li Hao to be ordinary.He should not be ordinary!There were countless creatures in the Silver Moon world, and there were even two Dao Masters, but Li Hao was the only one who had taken the seed of time.The seed of time ... Who left it behind?If Li Hao guessed it would be a fight, second cat would naturally think the same.If that was the case, then Li Hao was the inheritor of Zhan. Even if Li Hao had only inherited a little bit of the seed of time, it was still counted. Second cat did not want the inheritor of Zhan to be like the bandits of neo martial arts. Even though they were really strong, amazing, and charming, they were not that kind of people.His fighting style was different from theirs.Neo martial artists had their own style.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ New martial arts didn't have a fighting style. Even people like the human King and the blood Emperor had their own styles. Second cat knew that he was being selfish, but he still hoped that Li Hao would go with his fighting style.Of course, Li Hao would never fight. No one could replace him in a fight.While second cat was still thinking, Li Hao smiled and said,""The contact with neo martial arts is just a normal contact. Venerable the sword and the others are a group of very interesting elders! I still like it very much ... When I see venerable the sword, I think of Nanquan and the others ... Even though there is a huge gap between their realms!"Li Hao sighed with emotion,"revered sword is actually a bit like my master!" However, my master isn't even a venerable sovereign now ... Perhaps Silver Moon has been greatly influenced by neo martial arts. I can sense some of Silver Moon Jianghu's flavor from them. "In other words, Silver moon's pugnacity originated from neo martial.Therefore, it was quite comfortable to be with the sword Saint.But ...A moment later, Li Hao said softly,"however, neo martial and I are destined not to be together completely. The Supreme is resourceful. The king is good at fighting. They're both too charming!" The human King is dictatorial, and the Supreme ..."He paused for a moment."He's just and fair. Although I admire him, I don't like him."Don't like it?Second cat was stunned. He didn't like the Supreme martial artist?Why was this so?Li Hao did not say anything.Why?Celestial pole and King Huai were used as bait. Zhang an was the grandson of a Supreme venerable, so the Supreme venerable must have known that Zhang an would come to meet them. Of the two venerable sovereigns, one was his grandson, who knew that the seventh or even eighth level of the Crimson Moon would descend at any time.However ... The Supreme martial artist had only sent the sword venerable to rescue him.Since they had set up an ambush, why did they start off with a strong start but end with a weak finish?There must be another plan, a bigger plan. Therefore, for the sake of the overall situation, the Supreme martial artist chose to give up on this side and do his best and leave it to fate. If a venerable sword could not resist, then at most, he would sacrifice a few people in exchange for greater benefits for neo martial arts.Was a Supreme martial artist a good person? To neo martial arts, he was definitely an indispensable counselor. A human King was brave enough. If a Supreme martial artist also had the character of a human King, neo martial arts would not go far.But to Li Hao ... He didn't like a person like Zhi Zun, who was willing to sacrifice himself, the world, and all his family for the greater good.Li Hao felt that, compared to Zhi Zun, although he also thought of himself as heartless and cold-blooded ... He was also a little more selfish.A person like Zhi Zun was indispensable. However, he might not be the kind of person that he wanted to live with.In fact, the people Li Hao knew, the people he valued, and the people who influenced him, whether it was Yuan Shuo, hou Xiaochen, or Nan Quan ... They all shared some similarities with Li Hao. They also looked at the big picture, but the big picture ... Was not as important as their own people.

Chapter 2858 The Embryonic Form Of The Myriad Realms (1)_3
To have Yuan Shuo sacrifice his own disciple to help Silver Moon?It would be strange if I didn't spit on your face!When second cat heard this, he thought for a while and didn't say anything.Li Hao continued,"the people of Silver Moon should rise up on their own. However, since neo martial arts are the origin of Silver Moon, senior cat two shouldn't reject it.""I'm not rejecting it!"Second cat muttered. It wasn't rejecting him, but it didn't care what happened to the Silver Moon people.It didn't care about the neo martial artists.The only person it cared about was Li Hao.'You Silvermoon people, even if you mix with the neo martial artists and become bandits, second cat doesn't even bat an eye. I just don't want you to be like that.'It was that simple!Big cat, such a good cat, it was a pity that it was led astray by neo martial.Er Mao didn't mention this again. It seemed that Li Hao had his own plans. He didn't want to join neo martial just because he met up with the sword Master. In that case, there was no need to say anything more."Do you want to cultivate now? You don't need to level up ... What do you need to cultivate?"It lived in the river and didn't notice any signs of Li Hao's advancement.Then why didn't he go with the sword Saint and the others?"Modify the river!"Li Hao said,"I still have some insights. Advancement isn't the key. The key is to sort out my future path!"Li Hao explained,"I want to sort out the river again. I want to make the stars and the stars of the great path more closely related to the river!" It's more closely connected to me. "Li Hao said softly,'I'm going to turn the stars into realms, into the embryonic form of worlds! Connected to the river! I want to turn the great Dao into a branch of the long river, I want to weave a stable wall of the long river ..."Second cat was a little dazed.This was no small matter. Li Hao often sorted out his own Dao, but after becoming a venerable sovereign, he usually only did it on a small scale. According to Li Hao, this time, it might be a large scale sorting.In fact, he even overthrew some of his original thoughts. "In addition," Li Hao continued,"I'm going to turn the stars into divine text. The divine text will become domains, and domains will become worlds. The worlds will be connected to the river ... And then, I'll return to the past. One divine text, One World, one domain, one star, one river, one law ..."Second cat understood. It was not a stupid cat.Li Hao had actually used this method before. The Holy prose breathing technique, one Wen, one technique."You mean, turning divine culture into a world, the world itself breathing, extracting the power of Chaos to stabilize the world?""Right!"Li Hao nodded and communicated with second cat. Even if second cat was only a rank two, it could understand what he meant. If it were someone else, they would probably be looking at him blankly.Li Hao looked at the black hole above his head and said, venerable the sword said that the key to opening up a cave lies in the first, the foundation of Dao! Second, the source of the energy! Then I'll think that I can still do it with the foundation of Dao, but the source of energy ... Actually still depends on chaos ... But I don't have the time to extract it bit by bit. It's better to go back to the past and let the divine text cultivate and strengthen itself ... One Dao, one text, one law, and extract the power of Chaos!" "Like this?"Second cat thought for a while and asked,"Actually ... It's just imitating chaos, right?"Li Hao nodded!He continued,"chaos, boundless, boundless, powerful, and unique! The dimension was unique! "Before this, I was wondering if the great Dao universe and the world were in the same dimension. Now, I know. They are! Both of them are actually in the chaos!""Then what I want to do now is to merge the great Dao universe into the world itself. The Dao is in the world!"Second cat listened carefully. It actually liked what Li Hao said.There was a feeling that he had returned to the past."Do you need my help?"Second cat would rarely take the initiative to help.At this moment, it took the initiative to say it, because it was actually very supportive of Li Hao's actions."Senior, just help me stabilize the river!" Li Hao smiled."A small matter!"This time, second cat didn't reject it. It wasn't a big deal."Other people weave their worlds with ten thousand DAOs," Li Hao said."I weave my worlds with ten thousand worlds. One Dao for each world ... This is the foundation. When my great Dao is perfected, I'll perfect my world Dao bit by bit!"Other people's worlds had tens of thousands of DAOs.And what Li Hao had to do now was to create one Dao for each world.Using one Dao of one realm to weave a long river.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ When he was strong enough, he could weave a world of 10000 DAOs. That way, it would be equivalent to stacking an infinite number of small worlds together. He still had to have dreams. In the end, he would be able to obtain a smaller chaosverse!This also made it easier for him to try out different weaving methods. After all, even if it collapsed, it was only one star and One World.Of course, the consumption was huge.Li Hao had received over a hundred million Dao crystals previously ... Logically speaking, this amount should be enough for him to cultivate to level six. However, it might not be enough for him to sort out his Dao and his realm.As for his strength, there might not be any increase.Was it a waste?Not a single bit of waste!Since he had thought of it, he would do it. He couldn't give up just because there was a possibility of failure. He was actually starting a business. There were risks in starting a business, but he would bear the risks himself. He didn't need others to bear the risks.Li Hao could take other paths, but sometimes, cultivation was not purely for the sake of becoming stronger.Sometimes, the process of exploration was also a form of pleasure.

Chapter 2859 The Embryonic Form Of The Myriad Realms (1)_4
He had thought of it, but he was worried that it would fail and go to waste. If he did not do it, it would be a great regret for Li Hao. Why should he leave so many regrets on the path of cultivation?Li Hao said no more and entered the river.Many stars were floating around him.Li Hao pondered for a while. The stars continued to circle and scatter in all directions.These stars eventually landed on the two sides of the river.It alternated between illusion and reality, one on each side.With the river as the center!It separated the stars once more.The next moment, the stars began to turn into divine text. Some of the stars were unable to completely turn into divine text because of their poor comprehension. The process of turning into divine text actually consumed a lot of energy and life force.In the past, the divine text consumed Li Hao's life force, and the foundation of the divine text was the power of life.This time, Li Hao chose to fuse with the divine text again.Divine runes were dispensable, but ever since he entered the dark Demon Ridge and realized the importance of domains, as well as his understanding of worlds this time, Li Hao had a new idea. His divine runes were actually very suitable to be transformed into worlds.Along the way, he had been learning as he walked. He had already put down some things, but when he found that they were useful, he would pick them up again.The first Star that had turned into divine text was not life and death, nor was it revival, but fire!Li Hao had a deep understanding of the fire element.His five birds technique included the fire element, which was also the Tiger in his heart. He had even borrowed the power of the seventh grade for the fire element. It could be said that life and death, Nirvana, and resurrection were perhaps only needed for advancement.However, the element of fire had actually been integrated into his bones from the very beginning.A ferocious Tiger roared in the river.Tiger out of the cage!It turned into a ball of fire once again. The flames roared wantonly in the long river. The great Dao crystals were instantly absorbed, and a powerful divine rune was taking shape.Li Hao was going to reforge the divine text he had used in the past.He had been too weak in the past. Now that he had become a fourth level venerable sovereign, the divine runes from before were obviously not strong enough.A moment later, the word "fire" appeared like a Roaring Tiger.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​  His roar reverberated through the river.The divine rune was also the beginning of Li Hao's experiment.Above the divine text, a shadow gradually emerged. It was Li Hao. It was not an avatar, but a thought. This thought began to cultivate, even breathing, swallowing and spitting chaos and the power of the river."Myriad DAOs breathing technique!"This was the new name Li Hao gave to his breathing technique, which originated from the secret technique of five birds. However, it wasn't just the five birds and five elements anymore. He wanted to cultivate ten thousand DAOs. Although the breathing technique wasn't perfect, he decided that he would cultivate this breathing technique for all DAOs.They were breathing at the same rate. Breathing together, Li Hao arrogantly thought that he would swallow chaos one day!Of course, this was just wishful thinking.The 'fire' character started to breathe and take in the power of the river.As for Li Hao, a golden light shot out of his eyes. Gradually, tens of thousands of lights appeared in the long river, flowing to both sides like a river.What Li Hao needed to do now was to connect the divine text with the river.A small tail appeared on the divine text of the word 'fire'.As for the little tail, it was searching for the fire-type Dao that had been integrated into the long river.The two forces from the same source met in the river this time. With a loud bang, the river trembled. It was as if a small tail had appeared on one side of the river.The divine text of the fire character was connected to the long river.At this moment, the "fire" character began to expand crazily. It absorbed the power of the river and began to swell as if it was going to turn into a big fatty. This was the result Li Hao wanted.He wanted to turn the divine text into a world. Even if it wasn't a world, it had to be a domain!In the end, these regions would connect with each other to form the wall of the river.Of course, they were actually cells.Li Hao's current plan was to build a real boundary wall outside these boundaries to isolate the chaos."People!"While he was thinking, Li Hao's heart moved.The river was blood and veins, the divine culture world was cells, and finally, a barrier was created. This was somewhat similar to creating humans. Of course, it wasn't that complicated yet.It was just a Straight River.However, this did feel like a human creation.He had created physical bodies for many people, so he had a deep understanding of them. What was the difference between the river and the human body?He stopped thinking about this and quickly began to construct.The word "fire" continued to expand and turned into a fire element domain. It began to squeeze out from one side of the long river. After a long time, the long river seemed to have collapsed. With a loud bang, a small gap appeared in the straight long river.The power of 10000 DAOs quickly surged into the gap.Among them, the fire-type power was the densest, and the other power of myriad DAOs was also flowing toward the domain formed by the fire-type divine culture.
