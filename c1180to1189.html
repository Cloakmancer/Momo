        ion, the night patrol of the inspection Division, Li Hao, has made outstanding contributions. In addition, the imperial family has just conferred him the title of Marquis heavenstar. This Liu suggests that Li Hao be promoted to Deputy Minister of night patrol. His contributions and rank are sufficient, but he is slightly lacking in qualifications ... However, in this era, we should still give the young some opportunities."
         Liu Yunqing laughed."So, I think we can promote him as we see fit! Secretary Chen, please think about it. I won't participate in the specifics. "
         He paused for a moment and continued,""If you're still not satisfied ... The Liu family has a relic, which may be a martial arts university, and they're making it public to make it up to the public. I'm not feeling well, so I won't say much."
         Outside the door, the eyes of the secretaries kept changing.
         Liu Yunqing lay flat on the bed.
         There was no struggle, no counterattack, but he laid flat so easily. Everyone also vaguely felt another aura. They understood in their hearts that perhaps the old Secretary had spoken.
         These senior secretaries were the existences who had set up the nine divisions in the past. No matter what they were like now, they were true figures in the past.
         He had seen too much of mutual deception. It seemed that he had long been prepared.
         On the side of the inspection Office, the Secretary smiled,""Then I won't bother Secretary Liu anymore. Take care of your body. We've been colleagues for many years. Don't let some vermin ruin your health."
         "Thank you for your concern."
          Secretary Liu replied and then went silent.
         When the secretaries saw this, they smiled and left.
         It was enough!
         As for how to divide it up, it would depend on each family's ability. The financial division held a lot of industries, not just industries, but also relics, human relations, network ...
         The Liu family had abandoned all of this, except for the taxes that they had not paid.
         Of course, this was the foundation of the Liu family. It was impossible to hand it over. If it was handed over, the financial division would be gone. It would be a bloody war with the Liu family. Now, the other party had only abandoned the peripheral industries.
         It was easier than expected.
         However, everyone was not that relaxed either. The Liu family was trying to raise Li Hao. Today, they had dealt a blow to the Liu family, but what about tomorrow?
         ……
         At this moment, the nine divisions were making a deal.
         The stellarsky city was also in an uproar.
         In a slum in stellarsky city, the little girl who had sent Li Hao to the city the other day was very close to Li Hao. She could even see him. The outskirts of stellarsky city were the slums, and the poor had no right to live in the city center.
         At this moment, the little girl was looking up at the sky without any fear.
         What was there to be afraid of when he had already fallen to this point?
         A battle between experts was a matter for the experts.
         She didn't understand the disputes of the big shots, so she didn't care. It was the business of the big shots.
         However, at this moment, she was staring at the sky. Some of the children beside her were a bit timid. One of them whispered,"Sister Yuqi, don't look anymore. It'll be troublesome if those experts sense you."
         The girl was still looking at the sky. After a while, she said,""I think I know that person!"
         "Who is it?"
         "The one in silver armor, the governor of the star military governor's office."  "Sister Yuqi has seen it before?"
         "Not before, it was a few days ago ..."
         "He just said that we can go to him if we have any grievances, right?" the girl suddenly asked.
         "The Big Shot just said that. Sister won't take it seriously, right?"
         Beside him, a child said softly,"these big shots are too terrifying. The big explosion just now seems to have killed many people. There's also the so-called 'Xuguang transformation'. We've heard of these big shots. The boss of the four Seas group and the boss of the sky Star Douluo arena ... Were all killed by him!"
         These two people could be said to be extremely famous. These children who ran errands and welcomed guests had actually heard of them. They were serious big shots, far from being comparable to the small punks in the area.
         The girl nodded and did not say anything.
         He was still looking at the sky.
         Li Hao, the governor of the Heavenly Star military governor's office!
         The demonic sword Li Hao!
         A few days ago, she had heard someone mention that he was a barbarian from the North. Many people said that he had killed countless people ... But before this, she had probably received him.
         He was going to patrol the night and find someone.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He didn't know who he was looking for before, but now that he knew, he was probably looking for hou Xiaochen, who had arrived earlier.
         But ... He still couldn't believe it.
         This incomparably cold and murderous great devil had actually taken his own bicycle to the Nightwalker's headquarters.
         The girl looked at the sky and fell into deep thought.
         After a long time, Li Hao lowered his head and left to kill again.
         ……
         The Heavenly Star Douluo arena.
          At this moment, it was frighteningly quiet. Those who were not quiet were all dead. Jin Shan had brought his men over. The Wei Wu Army had surrounded the star Douluo arena. In the Douluo arena, many people were kneeling and did not dare to get up.
         There was also a group of guests who were carefully preparing to leave. Some of them were negotiating with the Wei Wu Army, and the quiet Douluo arena became noisy."What are you guys doing? I'm from the star Administration Bureau ..."
         "We're just here to watch a game. Is that against the law?"
         “……”
         Many people wanted to leave quickly.
         At this moment, there were many people watching from the outside, but none of them came close.
         The Wei Wu Army did not have many powerhouses, only the Golden spear sunrise.
         As for the others, the three suns had some combat power, but they were few in number.
         Such a Wei Wu Army would not be able to suppress the Heavenly Star Douluo arena.
         However, the people in the Douluo arena didn't dare to resist. The noisy guests didn't dare to resist either, because they all knew that a killing star was coming. In fact, some people wanted to run away, but the powerhouses all sensed that the southern Fist had arrived first.
        
         Nan Quan landed on the ground and looked at Jin gun. His mocking gaze made Jin gun burst into flames.
         Nan Quan looked at the noisy people with a smile and said lightly,""Everything will wait until Governor li arrives. Everyone, don't move recklessly. This is stellarsky city, and the governor also follows the rules and laws. If you run around, you're going against the law ... Don't blame me for not warning you if you die."
         Someone stood out from the crowd and looked at Nan Quan. He took a deep breath and smiled,""Brother he, I'm just here to join in the fun. I won't meet Governor li. The ninth Prince is still waiting for me. Do you think I can go back first?"
         "Yo, you're here too!"
         "Sure, you can go!" Nan Quan smiled and nodded.
         That person immediately heaved a sigh of relief. The next moment, he heard Southern Fist chuckling and saying,""I'm just a supernumerary personnel. It doesn't mean that the inspection Office is on night duty ..."
         The man's footsteps stopped, and his face stiffened.
         Then what the hell are you saying!
         What do you mean by that?
         He wanted to leave, but he did not dare to.
          At this moment, a large ship landed on the ground with a loud crash. Li Hao, who was wearing silver armor, looked down at the people below. The surroundings instantly fell silent.
         Li Hao only looked at these people, but he gave them great pressure.
         The expert who had previously communicated with the southern Fist also stopped smiling and took a step back. He cursed in his heart,"when did the F * cking Southern Fist get together with Li Hao, this killer?"
         Li Hao only looked at these people. There were people from the Douluo arena, and there were also spectators.
         Many of the spectators looked at the ship and exchanged glances when they saw the people on the ship.
         Some of them were even a family. They were brothers, sisters, father and son ...
         At this moment, they saw each other in such a situation.
         The atmosphere was a little awkward.
         Li Hao smiled and said,"arrest them all!" The people of the Douluo arena would be detained by the Wei Wu Army. As for the guests of the Douluo arena, they could board the ship! I'm not an unreasonable person, and if I were to just take a look, it wouldn't be a crime, but ... I'll probably have to suffer a bit. "
         "I should, I should!"
         Someone spoke. An old man walked out with a smile."Governor li, it's only right for us to cooperate with the law enforcement. We have no objections, but ... We would like to ask, how long will it take?"
         Li Hao also smiled and said very affably,""If it's fast, a day. If it's slow ... It's only a few days!"
         A few days is a few days?  Even though he wanted to ask, the old man did not say anything.
         At this moment, a person walked over from the outside. From a distance, he said to Li Hao,""Governor Li, I'm Zhou Qin, the Deputy Minister of the night patrol. I just saw my son on the ship, I wonder ..."
         The Deputy Minister was one rank higher than Li Hao.
         Li Hao turned his head to look at the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man smiled and sent another message."My son just likes to play around a little. He's not a troublemaker. I'll take him back and discipline him more."
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows, smiled, and said,""Alright, I'll bring you to the headquarters and record it down. Department head Zhou, you can take your men and leave."
         Minister Zhou frowned slightly and transmitted his voice again,""Governor li, there's no need to go through so much trouble. I'll just take it away now ..."
         Li Hao looked at him for a long time before he slowly said,""There are thousands of people here! "There are all kinds of people. Department head Zhou, I've already given you face. We're all on the same side. When you go back, just take her away and pay a fine. Why do you have to take her away at this time and place? are you not giving me face or are you trying to use this opportunity to step on me and show your dignity?"
         After saying that, Li Hao walked toward him step by step. Nan Quan, yang Shan, and the others quickly surrounded him.
         "Whose words did you listen to?" Li Hao said expressionlessly.
         "Or do you think that I should give in to you just because you're one level higher than me?"
         "I already said that I'll release him after we get back. You're so insistent. Do you think that I, Li Hao, won't dare to do anything to you, your superior? or do you think ... You're stronger than me?"
         His killing intent was overflowing!
          Minister Zhou's face was a little serious. He took a deep breath and said,""It's a misunderstanding. I'm just too eager to see my son. Governor Li, you've misunderstood. Since you've said so, we'll talk about it when we get back."
         Li Hao gave him a deep look."Don't be a tool for others. A peak Sunglow is very strong, but it also depends on the timing! If someone wants me to release them, come in person. Don't hide behind my back like a grandson! "And you ... The star military governor's office is probably not under your jurisdiction. I'll investigate your son. If he's fine, I'll let him go. If he's not ... You can try and see if you can take him away from a Silver Moon Martial Master!"
         Minister Zhou was silent. He nodded and turned to leave without saying anything.
         He was just testing the waters, but Li Hao was very determined.
         Tonight was Li Hao's home ground.
         If he were to say anything now, it would easily lead to a conflict, and this was not the result he or the person behind him wanted. They were just testing the waters, but Li Hao's intense reaction only served to prove how unreasonable and unbridled Silver moon's men were.
         Seeing that even Li Hao's superior had been defeated, the surrounding onlookers all chose to stop.
         If Li Hao had agreed to let her go just now, people would have immediately surrounded her, demanding her release.
         If you let go of the night patrolmen, why not let go of the others?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But Li Hao had refused. At this moment, no one came forward to test him.
        
         Those noble young masters and young ladies in the Douluo arena all looked as if they had lost their parents. Although they might not be in any trouble, they had been captured and taken to be night patrollers ... Who knew what this murderous demon would do?
         They could smell the stench in the boat.
         This was not a good thing.
         This meant that these people had been scared out of their wits.  However, under Li Hao's gaze, these arrogant aristocrats obediently walked back to the ship. The Wei Wu Army started to detain the people from the Douluo arena.
         No one resisted.
         The overall situation was set.
         When Liu Sha was killed and the few sunguang that she brought with her were blown to death, the Heavenly Star Douluo arena was destined to be unable to resist.
         "Seal this place!"
         Li Hao's voice rang out."Bring everyone back to the night patrollers 'headquarters. We won't wrong anyone, and we won't let anyone off. Anyone who violates the laws of stellarsky will be punished!"
          He looked around and at the people who were watching. Some of them retreated a little, while others continued to stand there with a straight face.
         Li Hao didn't think much of it either,'friends and family have been captured. I'm sorry for the trouble caused by the enforcement tonight. Also ..."
         Li Hao's voice was loud and clear."The guards at the city gate were killed by the star Douluo arena's boss. I didn't stop them. I've sinned. Those guards were implicated by me, causing their deaths. Their families can go to the inspection Division or the financial division to get their pension. They will be compensated according to the battle death regulations!"
         After saying this, the big ship flew up and instantly left this place.
         Another voice sounded in Li Hao's ears.""Governor li, Secretary mu would like to have a chat with you tomorrow. If you're free, you can go to mu clan or the Department of Internal Affairs to have a chat."
         "We will!"
         The people from the Department of Internal Affairs secretly transmitted their voices and did not appear.
         Chief mu obviously didn't want to show up either. He didn't want to have any conflicts with Li Hao, even though his daughter had been captured.
         The Flying Ship was flying.
         A moment later, they arrived at the night patrollers 'headquarters.
         There were many people on the ship. Previously, there were only about 3000 people, but now there were 4000.
         The night patrollers 'headquarters had already been in a mess.
         At this time, the headquarters was brightly lit and people were coming and going.
         At the door, the three of them were even more curious. They looked outside, and as the ship landed with a boom, they craned their necks to look. Li Hao was the first to get off.
         At the main entrance, Chief Steward Yu was present, but hou Xiaochen was not.
         Chief Steward Yu smiled when he saw Li Hao, but his smile soon turned into helplessness.
         It's really good!
         We all thought that you had run away. Good Lord, the moment you appeared, you struck like lightning. Tonight, more than ten sunguang's died. Such a loss can be said to be extremely heavy.
         Not only was chief Yu there, but Yao SI's Secretary was also there.
         Seeing Li Hao, he was a little timid, but he still suppressed his fear and said,"Governor li, the Minister wants you to go to his place when you're free ..."
         "I know."
         Li Hao nodded. He wasn't familiar with the Nightwatchers, but at this moment, whether they were on guard, on duty, or just watching the fun, they all hurriedly avoided Li Hao's gaze.  Only the three of them were curiously staring at Li Hao.
         Li Hao glanced at the three of them but didn't pay them any attention. He knew that these people were troublesome among the night patrollers.
         But ... So what?
         The three of them had been staring at Li Hao the whole time. Seeing that Li Hao was ignoring them, they were a little unhappy. Their big eyes revealed a smile."Governor li, we are ..."
         "There's something else, let's talk later!"
         Li Hao glanced at them and replied indifferently.
         Li Hao's big eyes were filled with anger. He suddenly sneered,""The People's wealth, your salary! He took the money but didn't work, a demon? Spiky? A bunch of trash!"
         “……”
         There was an instant silence.
         The three of them changed their expressions. Li Hao looked at them coldly and said,""What are you looking at? "I, Li Hao, have taken a lot of money and done a lot of work. I'm worthy of my salary and the promise I made when I was in the inspector office!" You guys ... Get lost, don't let me find out anything, otherwise ... I'll make you guys suffer!"
         The three people's expressions changed, and the others also had shocked expressions.
         What ... What was going on?
         What did that mean?
         Li Hao ignored them and walked into the night patrollers 'headquarters.
         Behind them, big eyes and the other two were stunned for a long time. After a long time, big eyes stammered,""He ... Is scolding us?"
         Yes, he had been scolded!
         "Yes, I was scolded," the man with the long blade replied, somewhat embarrassed.
         "They ... They don't like us," the man with the gun sighed.
         Yes, that was what he meant.
         The three of them wanted to greet each other, but Li Hao didn't care at all. What monster, what thorn, what genius, what figure on the God tier master ranking, he didn't take them seriously. He wasn't too arrogant, he just felt that these people weren't true heroes.
         There was no need to feign civility.
          The big-eyed man looked a little depressed."I saw him killing everyone tonight. I thought he was worth befriending. In the end ... Hmph!"
         In the end, they were ignored and even scolded.
         The big-eyed man was also extremely annoyed!
         Soon, he saw a person on the bow of the ship and suddenly laughed.""Mu Xiaorong, you've also been caught?"
         Mu Xiaorong ignored her.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The big-eyed man laughed."I didn't expect that. But ... That person is really bold. He even dared to capture you."
         "Beg me, I'll think of a way to help you leave ..." She said with a smile.
         Just as he said that, a sword will covered them, and their expressions changed.
         The next moment, a long sword with killing intent landed in front of the three of them. The big-eyed man's expression changed drastically, and a loud boom was heard!
         Li Hao's voice was heard."It doesn't matter if it's a joke or if it's true. Whoever dares to let go of the people I brought back ... I'll take their lives!"
        
         "I'm just joking ... Really ..."
         Blood flowed out of the big-eyed man's mouth as he took a few steps back. He was a little depressed and shocked."I don't get along with her. I was just joking. I don't have any intention of letting her go ..."
         The spear-wielding man and the long-saber man's expressions changed slightly.
         So strong!
         This Li Hao ... Was not only powerful, but also overbearing.
         Big eyes was indeed just joking. She and mu Xiaorong had not been on good terms for many years, but Li Hao had attacked her directly.
         Li Hao didn't pay any attention to him, and his longsword disappeared.
         The big-eyed man was a little depressed. He gritted his teeth and felt a little depressed.
         Seeing this, mu Xiaorong sneered with a hint of mockery.
         Did you suffer a loss?
          That guy was cold-blooded and heartless to the extreme.
         One of his own?
         She could tell that Li Hao did not treat the Nightwatchers as his own people. The only people he considered his own were probably Silver Moon and the other martial masters.
         He seemed to have treated all the non-moon elemental mages as his imaginary enemies.
         The thousands of people on the ship were all silent.
         There was no other reason. There were still people guarding.
         Yang Shan and his wife, and the southern Fist.
         At this moment, Nan Quan also laughed. He looked at the three of them and chuckled,""Call Jian out to fight him, or else ... Forget it. Don't worry, old hou and I won't care if Dao Jian comes out to fight him ... Hahaha!"
         It's good to watch the fun.
         The three of them didn't say a word, nor did they stop. They left in a hurry, all of them looking bitter.
         Not only was Li Hao arrogant, but he was also very strong ... Forget it, he'd better just suffer a loss.
         If they stayed any longer, they might be killed by that madman.
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The department head's office.
         Hou Xiaochen laughed and shook his head."What's the point? they're just three troublemakers. They didn't do anything bad. You didn't even show any mercy to the three major organizations. Something's not right with you."
         "The killing intent hasn't subsided."
         Li Hao also smiled."I want to kill those thousands of people outside ... But I don't dare to. It turns out that sometimes, it's really not right to kill when I can. So, it's not a big deal to bully three little friends." Who told them to talk nonsense?"
         "Little friend?" hou Xiaochen laughed.
         Are you as old as them?
         "I have a headache ..." He laughed and sighed.
         "I know,"
         Li Hao nodded."There is trouble, but it's not that big. I can see that both the nine divisions and the royal family are just a bunch of paper tigers. They talk fiercely, but when interests are involved, whoever kills me will have to pay a huge price. They don't dare to and can't bear to ... Just like when the night patrollers were established."
         "With the strength I've revealed today, you can't kill me without using divine abilities! Even if the divine power came, wasn't there still the Minister? Unless they come to an agreement ... Even if I can, I'll need time. Do you think I can kill the God art during this time?"
         "You're ... Interesting. "Hou Xiaochen laughed," I thought you were a different person than before. "
         Li Hao shook his head,"I didn't want to!" "However, this world keeps pushing me down and challenging my bottom line. I've thought it through. If I don't change, I won't be able to stand firm. If I can't stand firm ... How can I talk about changing?"
         Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment before nodding.
         At this moment, he looked at Li Hao and found that he was a little different. After a long time, he said,""How do you want to deal with the people outside?"
         "Check it out. If there aren't any major problems, let them go. Just pay some ransom to the family. If there are any major problems ... Hand them over to the inspection Division to handle."
         Li Hao was calm."It's fine if the inspection Office doesn't deal with them. But do you really think they'll kill them?"
         "Hahaha, sure, this one's not bad!"
         "That's good. Even if the inspection Office lets them go, that's their business ..."Hou Xiaochen nodded.
         "No!" Li Hao shook his head."If the inspection Office lets them go, I'll go and catch them again!"
         Hou Xiaochen was stunned for a moment. He looked at Li Hao. What did he mean?
         Li Hao said calmly,"I'm the Vice Governor of the Heavenly Star military governor's office. I have this right!" I'll let the people of stellarsky know that I, Li Hao, am not afraid of power and dare to flip the table! Yes, the People's hearts were useless. If Secretary Liu said it, it was nothing! But I'm thinking ... If I can give them a little bit of light, can a single spark start a Prairie Fire? How many superpowers and how many ordinary people?"
         "As long as they haven't broken away from this level and the crowd, they will need people to rule or deter them. And I ... Hope to light up some light for them ..."
         Hou Xiaochen's mind wandered.
         A moment later, he smiled and nodded,""That's reasonable, and also ... A good idea! However, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold on much longer. "  He sighed.
         What are you doing?
         I was suddenly a little scared.
         Li Hao seemed to have gone crazy. Who the hell had instilled these ideas into him?
         Hong Yitang or heaven battling city?
         If this continued, he really couldn't handle it.
         Outside the door, Chief Steward Yu walked in. He seemed to have heard what Li Hao said and looked at Li Hao in surprise and shock. After a long while, he said,""Li Hao, the department head will fully support you. The department head is also a righteous person!"
         “……”
         Hou Xiaochen wanted to roll his eyes.
         What do you know?
         You just said that!
         This was the first time he felt that Yu Luosha trusted him too much. He felt that it wasn't a good thing. She thought that he was omnipotent ... It made him helpless!
         Li Hao couldn't help but laugh. He nodded and said,""Of course, the Minister is the source of my confidence!"
         "Minister, you said before that killing a divine power Expert would make people fear you," he said with a smile."This time, there's no divine power. I have to think of a way to lure them out and show my might!"
         “……”
         "Cough, cough, cough!"
         Hou Xiaochen's illness seemed to be acting up again. He coughed for a long time before panting,"No need, I'm fine now ... Li Hao, you must be tired. Go back and rest!"
         "I have no place to stay, so I'll stay in the office for the night. Tomorrow, I'll go and see where my Marquis's mansion is."
         Hou Xiaochen was mentally exhausted.
         You can F * cking go!
         Li Hao didn't want to leave, so he had to. He stood up, coughed, and said,""Then you go ahead with your work. It's fine if you take a break. I'll go out and take a look ... I'll also make a trip to the inspection Office and report the incident at the star Douluo arena ... After all, it's related to the governor's office."
         With that, he got up and left.
         He couldn't stand Li Hao anymore.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. After watching hou Xiaochen leave, he suddenly laughed and shouted,"Men!"
         Soon, someone entered the door carefully.
         "Governor li ... Do you have any orders?"
         "Go, find a place ... No, the night patrolmen should have a prison. Lock them up."
         The man's face turned pale."Commander ... We ... We do have a prison cell, but ... But it can accommodate hundreds of people. Outside ..."
         There were too many people!
         "Then we'll lock them up in an office building with no office. I don't think they dare to run away, as they'll be sentenced to death if they do! Go and arrange for all the major newspapers in Tian Xing city to report tonight's incident ..."
         "Well ... The news agency doesn't know the details, and ... And the news agency is usually under the jurisdiction of the division and administration Division ..."
         Li Hao looked at him."Don't the Nightwatchers have any news agencies under their control?" he asked.
         ? "There are some ... But very few ..."
         "That's good!"
         "Minister Huang ..."
         Li Hao looked at him and interrupted him. He said coldly,""Just do it. If Huang Long is not convinced, tell him to come to me!"
          The person didn't dare to say anything more and quickly left.
         Li Hao's voice came from behind him."Just read the contents of the newspaper once. Explain clearly what you've done. In addition ... Add one more sentence. The superpowers are chaotic, and the transcendents are unscrupulous. There must be an umbrella. The star military governor's office will definitely eliminate these parasites!"
         The staff member who was walking away staggered a little, but he did not dare to turn back. He nodded quickly and left quickly.
         This Li Hao ... Was really too crazy.
         He couldn't afford to offend him. As for Minister Huang ... At this moment, he felt that it was best not to cause a scene. Otherwise, Li Hao might be even more ruthless than hou Xiaochen. Hou Xiaochen would talk about some basic methods, but Li Hao wouldn 't.
         ……
         At the same time.
         Long building.
         The old man drank a cup of tea and exhaled. He suddenly smiled and muttered,""We've invited a Wolf into our house!"
         He laughed and shook his head. The stellarsky city was going to be bustling with noise and excitement.
        
         [The verified author has given his monthly vote. I remember v i remember to vote.] I'll start updating in the afternoon tomorrow, Saturday. I'll sleep in in the morning. I'm so sleepy! Please vote!
         Hou Xiaochen's office.
         Li Hao occupied the seat and leaned back in his chair, deep in thought.
         He had come to stellarsky city to see the essence and the truth.
         Tonight, she might have seen and seen through some of it, but it was still not very clear. She was still a little confused.
         But Li Hao felt that it was enough.
         Human lives were like grass.
         Whether it was the nine divisions or the three great organizations, it was all the same.
         Pirates, the nine divisions, the three major organizations ... There really wasn't much difference. The difference was that one had a ruling position, and the other didn 't.
         A large corporation under the financial division was actually feeding the demons with humans.
          Most importantly, the demon did not eat humans.
         As for the human race itself, they sent humans to their mouths and begged others to eat them. Wasn't that despicable?
         This was not the early period of the ancient civilization where the demons were strong and the humans were weak.
         The human race in this era was very powerful!
         There were not many well-known demons in the current demon race. Only a few places like Phoenix Mountain and heavenly ROC mountain had famous great demons. On the whole, the human race was stronger and there was no need to bow to the demon race.
         On the contrary, it was the demons who should bow and kneel to the humans. That was more reasonable.
         But ... The human race was too scattered.
         Everyone hoped to gain the support of the demon race. Therefore, some people did not hesitate to please the other party, groveling and even offering their own kind.
         "It's the same. "
         Li Hao wrote down some things on the paper. It was all the same. Big brother doesn't say second brother, so when the black material of the Financial Secretary was revealed this time, in fact, whether it was ordinary people or transcendents ... They didn't take it too seriously.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wasn't it the same?
         Ordinary people would probably only be angry and sad for a while, and then ... They would have no choice. There was no way at all. What could they do?
         Overthrowing the nine divisions?
         Was there a difference if it was the royal family?
         What was the difference if they were exchanged for the three major organizations?
         Wasn't he still going to live like this?
         The board did not hit him, and it did not hurt. It was just like that. Or rather, this was a situation that could not be changed. He could only sadly wait for the strong to decide the winner and accept the new ruler.
         "Other than god tier Masters, there's almost no other path for ordinary people to improve ... Academies are controlled, and martial masters require money and resources to cultivate. There are no mountain gates that are open, and just like what the girl said, it's useless to learn skills. This is an era where strength is the most important ..."
         They had no way out.
         The saddest thing about an era was that hierarchy couldn't be broken. Li Hao's situation was completely unexpected. In reality, unless you were a God-tier master blessed by the heavens, you couldn't break through all this.
         Look at these powerhouses, which one of them didn't have a powerful background?
         There were almost no ordinary people who rose to power.  Which of the Xuguang Li Hao had met was an ordinary person?
         Thoughts gradually emerged in Li Hao's mind. He fell into deep thought, thinking about things that he wouldn't have thought about before.
         He felt that he was possessed.
         Heaven battling city, Hongyi Hall, the existence in the illusionary realm, and many other things were influencing him, causing him to unconsciously choose to step into the big quagmire of Heavenly Star City.
         "Next time, if you want to deal with me, you'll definitely use divine arts!"
         Li Hao knew that when several sunrises were killed, their divine power Charms were broken, and their energy bombs were swallowed ... He had almost exposed all his trump cards. The next one to come would be a divine power realm.
         The divine-tier might not be stable, but to the leaders of these major forces, they could use the spring of life to smash it!
         He would always be able to smash it steadily.
         If one drop was not enough, then 10 drops. These guys might have discovered the existence of the monster plant and even reached some kind of agreement. Otherwise, would there really be so many in the ruins 'inventory?
         Li Hao discovered that many experts had them. Almost all the major forces had them.
         Many thoughts appeared in his mind.
         A moment later, someone knocked on the door.
         "Come in."
         Yang Shan and his wife entered. Although yang Shan had already entered the metamorphosis stage, he was still very polite to Li Hao. He said with a smile,""Governor li, the arrangements have been made. Old he said that the imperial family has summoned him back. He has left first and will come back to find you later."
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
         Yang Shan smiled shyly."Governor li, then we husband and wife ... Governor, do you have any instructions?"
         This time, yang Shan was even more polite than before.
         Because Li Hao himself was a strong person!
         He had killed Wu Yong and suppressed quicksand. Li Hao was not as weak as they had imagined. In fact, he was even stronger than the rumors had said. He was young, could help everyone improve, and had a group of backers ...
         To yang Shan, Li Hao was a good support.
         During his transformation, he could go out and establish a great force.
          And then?
         Was he waiting to be taken in by someone else, or was he waiting to do something big on his own?
         What a joke!
         To fight against the three major organizations and the imperial family without any trump cards or Trump cards?
         Yang Shan was not an idiot.
         Moreover, Li Hao might be the key to his opportunity to enter the divine-tier.
         Li Hao glanced at him, smiled, and slowly said,""Senior yang, you don't have to be so polite ..."
         "No, no, no, what senior!"
         "Didn't we join the star military governor?"yang Shan smiled brightly. You can call me old Yang or patrol inspector yang, but if you call me senior ... Then you're treating me like an outsider. "
         Li Hao looked at him for a while and said softly,""Don't bend your back because of what's in front of you. It's hard to straighten your back if you bend it. The situation is more complicated and dangerous than you think. Today is just the beginning. "
        
         Yang Shan looked reckless, but he was actually as smart as a monkey. He quickly smiled and said,""What are you saying? in this day and age, unless you're truly unrivaled, who wouldn't bow down? Even someone as strong as Minister hou was bending his back ... Danger is danger, but there are also opportunities. Once we enter this path, there's no way out! Besides, other than the governor, no one would be willing to fall out with a High Duke's public house for us. "
         "I can?" Li Hao smiled.
         "You don't have to worry about having too many lice!"
         Yang Shan's face was also full of smiles."The nine divisions are not afraid. The three major organizations are not afraid. The seven divine mountains are not afraid ... Why would our Governor li be afraid of an Guo Duke?"
         Li Hao laughed heartily."Senior yang is interesting. It's not without reason that you became friends with senior Southern Fist!"
         Yang Shan also smiled brightly.
         Li Hao smiled and nodded."Then, I'll have to trouble patrol inspector yang to help me with something."
         "Commander, please speak!"
         Yang Shan was overjoyed. Li Hao had agreed.
         It was a good thing!
          In the future, I can also take advantage of the Tiger's might ... Bah, I can also appear in public and directly throw my face at the an country Duke. Come and hit me, I've found a backer!
         I've been hiding here and there before, but now I'm not afraid of you.
         I've changed my backer, and they dare to start a war with the nine divisions. Can you, the Duke of an country, be more powerful than the Duke of ding country?
         "Since there's still time, patrol yang should make a trip to the North Sea ..."
         Yang Shan's expression changed slightly.
         Li Hao said softly,"go to the North Sea and find the King of the North Sea of the Starlight Pirates. Tell him that his grandson is in my hands ... Of course, maybe he already knows. Maybe a grandson is not too important. It's not a big deal."
         "But, I can try. Let him help me with something."
         "Please speak, commander," yang Shan said nervously.
         "I want white shark's head!"
         "Tell him to give me the head of the White shark," Li Hao said calmly."I'll let his grandson go. I'll also give him a free ride,"
         Yang Shan heaved a sigh of relief."That's easy ... He won't lose anything. White shark is one of the eight great Pirates of the North Sea. The Starlight Pirates also hope to recruit them. Killing white shark is probably part of their plan!"
         Li Hao's condition wasn't too much.
         As for why Li Hao wanted the head of the great white shark ... It was said that there was a conflict between the two sides, but yang Shan did not care about that. He was afraid that Li Hao would ask him to take the head of the North Sea King.
         The King of the North Sea was at least in the transformation stage.
         Even the red-bearded man from the East Sea was one of them, not to mention the North Sea. The North Sea pirates were very strong. If they were not strong, it would be difficult to establish themselves in the North. The North was more barbaric, and the Duke dingguo's mansion could do it with just a word in the East Sea.
         However, in the North ... He might have to take down the territory bit by bit.
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Yes, that's all. Also ... After you've gone to the North Sea and met the North Sea King ... Go and find Silver Moon Liu Long."  After saying that, he threw a storage ring to him.""Give this to Regiment commander Liu Long and ask him to help me get some things. If he knows what I need, just say" Imperial Palace. ""
         Yang Shan took the storage ring and was curious about what was inside.
         Li Hao, however, didn't think so. He said indifferently,""One million divine power stones, 20 origin divine weapons ... Senior Yang can also bring senior Qin Lian along ..."
         Yang Shan swallowed his saliva.
         What?
         A million divine energy stones!
         20 origin divine weapons!
         His scalp was extremely numb. At this moment, even his heart was trembling with some difficulty and trembling."This ... Governor, this ... Why don't we change to someone else ..."
         To anyone, this was an astronomical figure.
         He couldn't imagine that Li Hao would dare to give him this thing after knowing him for only a day.
         This was too terrifying!
         It was so terrifying that he felt that Li Hao was testing him. He was afraid that something would go wrong if he took this.
         Li Hao just looked at him calmly and said,"if you can run away with a mere one million divine power stones ... Why should I believe that you will work for me?" If you don't care about this today, then if someone wants you to take my life the next day ... Tell me, how big of a price will I have to pay you? In this world, who would be willing to pay such a high price to buy you over? Whether it's more dangerous to kill me or to run away with the money, senior has his own judgment. "
         "So ... Senior, just take it. I'm not threatening you. Senior, you can also take senior Qin Lian with you."
         "You must be joking, Governor!" Qin Lian immediately replied. The governor doesn't have anyone under him now. I'm a dark-type superpower and can still act as an advisor for the governor. Yang Shan won't be of much use even if he stays. It's not a war. He won't know anything if he stays!"
          "Yes!" He looked at yang Shan."You can go. Complete the task that the governor has given you!"
         Yang Shan glanced at his wife, gritted his teeth, nodded, and said in a muffled voice,""Don't worry, commander. Yang Shan will definitely complete the mission. Unless I die, there will be no shortage of items!"
         He was trembling.
         A million divine power stones and 20 origin divine weapons ...
         Li Hao was too terrifying.
         Yes, he was scared.
         They had only known each other for a day. It was too terrifying. Whether it was to test him or to really not care, yang Shan was struggling in his heart. After a moment, he threw away all his fantasies. He could not be moved.
         Putting aside the fact that his wife had betrayed the high Duke's public house for his sake, it was also a big problem whether he could escape being hunted down after offending Li Hao. If he wanted to enter the divine power realm, it would not be a simple matter of divine power stones and origin divine weapons.
         No matter how many divine power stones there were, what was the use?
         After thinking this through, he suddenly let out a breath, and the greed in his heart disappeared in an instant. 'That's right, I can't directly absorb energy to enter the divine-power realm. This thing is better than Li Hao absorbing more sword energy for himself.'
        
         "Then go. The earlier you go, the earlier you come back. I might need people here at any time."
         "Alright!"
         Yang Shan did not say much and left quickly. He did not even have time to say goodbye to his wife.
         "Governor, do you have any other orders?" Qin Lian also asked softly.
         "Help me find out where there are Crimson Moon experts, the top-notch ones. It's best if they're in the transformation stage ... The elders Council or the ancient divine guards should have them. If you really can't ... Help me find out where Blue Moon and orange moon are. "
         These two might not have any Red Shadows, but it didn't matter. Capture them and Exchange them for ransom!
         Would Ying Hongyue change?
         They would!
         This was because Ying Hongyue was a very arrogant and Savage person. She also thought that she was unparalleled in her righteousness. His woman had been captured, so he would change her.
         If Li Hao asked for a red shadow from sunguang's transformation, he would most likely give it to him.
          "Yes!"
         Qin Lian didn't say much and quickly left.
         As for whether she would run away with yang Shan ... Li Hao really didn't care.
         Yes, a very valuable storage ring.
         However, if they really took it away, then so be it. They had gained a lot this time. If they took it away, it would be over for the two of them. Li Hao wouldn't have to be on guard against them all the time. He was a vigilant person to begin with.
         He wouldn't easily believe that others would risk their lives for him.
         But if they didn't take it away ... Just as Li Hao said, the next time someone bribed them, the couple wouldn't be moved at all unless they offered a better price that far exceeded this.
         However, who would pay such a huge price to buy over yang Shan?
         ……
         After sending the couple away, Li Hao took out some things ... Looking at the storage rings that filled the table, Li Hao was still taking out more and more.
         He had at least 2000 of the storage rings that he had once regarded as a treasure.
         Almost half of the people arrested tonight were there.
         The other half didn't have one, because they were either servants or service staff. The true nobles had one each.
         Many, many times!
         There were also several powerhouses from the four Seas Corporation, several people in the transformation stage, many people from the rising sun, people from the four islands, and people from the sky Star Douluo arena.
         There were too many.
         Seeing so many storage rings, Li Hao's head hurt.
         In the past, he liked to open storage rings.
         It was a surprise every time!
         The last time he had obtained the Xu clan's treasure vault, he had opened it together with Yuan Shuo and the others, but now ... There were dozens of times more than the previous time. Even if he were to go through the entire vault by himself every three minutes, there would be more than 2000 of them, which would take him more than 6000 minutes ...
         If he didn't eat or drink, he would have to clear it for four to five days.
         Counting wasn't something that could be done by just looking. Even three minutes might not be enough.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao smiled bitterly.
         Once upon a time, he would be worried about having too many storage rings.
         There was one this time!
         He picked up the communicator on the table and dialed the number without caring who was on the outside line,"Ask golden spear and wood forest to see me!"
         "Alright, immediately ..."
          Li Hao hung up the communication. He was a little envious of old hou. It was so good to have a Secretary. With just a simple arrangement, the Secretary would do it properly, while he ... Was so pitiful that he had to do the work himself.  If he wanted to find someone, he would have to make a call himself.
         ……
         A few minutes later, golden spear and wood forest arrived.
         They weren't surprised to see Li Hao here. Where did hou Xiaochen go? they knew that Li Hao's appearance when he occupied The Magpie's Nest ... Was so handsome!
         "Golden spear senior, brother ermu ..."
         Mu Lin laughed drily. Jin Shan nodded his head and became even more silent. Jin Shan looked thinner and older than before. He was getting more and more depressed after suffering so many blows.
         The Battle of the North Sea, the Battle of the East, and the battle of the southern Fist today ...
         Without exception, all of them were telling him that they were strong and he was weak.
         Seven Swords, three Spears, four blades, two fists ...
         "Your three spear strikes have completely fallen.
         Therefore, he had almost nothing to say.
         Mu Lin, however, was as usual. He smiled and said,""Department head li, the people from the Douluo arena have all been locked up. Is there anything else you need to do?"
         "Yes."
         Li Hao nodded."Gather the Wei Wu Army ..." He said."There's a station here, right?"
         "Yes, there is. It's just next to it, and there's a big house there. It's really, really big. The old men of stellarsky city know how to enjoy it. There are such big houses everywhere on Jiusi Street, and they take up dozens of acres of land. It's not difficult to station a thousand people there."
         "Take me to them."
         Mu Lin was a little surprised. What was he doing?
         Power?
         Cough, cough, you're thinking too much.
         It shouldn't be.
         Then what for?
         Li Hao didn't explain, and golden spear didn't ask. The two of them led Li Hao out. On the way, the other Nightwatchers greeted Li Hao when they saw him.
         "Governor!"
         "Good day, Governor li!"
         “……”
         They were all very well-behaved.
          There was no Fu character.
         As for hou Xiaochen, people usually called him Minister hou. The five military governors had actually existed in name only before. It was only recently that hou Xiaochen showed his power first and Li Hao took over as the Heavenly Star military governor, making him famous in the dynasty.
         Everyone knew that the night patrolman of the dynasty had the Heavenly Star military governor's office under him.
         Of course, Li Hao was publicly acknowledged as the governor.
         Li Hao didn't reply, appearing rather aloof. He didn't smile at them and win their hearts ... He didn't need to.
         At this moment, he wasn't too interested in all the officials in heavenstar.
         He didn't believe that these people didn't know the situation on the four islands.
         So...In this era, everyone was blind and pretending to be deaf and mute. He did not like it. Perhaps he knew that this was very helpless and should not be angry with them. They were very weak and could not compete with the nine divisions.
         Everyone had their own helplessness.
         Do you expect the three suns to overthrow the nine divisions?
        
         Li Hao understood this.
         Although he understood, he still couldn't let go of his youthful spirit.
         ……
         Li Hao went to the next room after being sent off by everyone.
         The courtyard next door was very, very big.
         This used to be a High Duke's public house ... Of course, it was now occupied by the nine divisions and became the garrison of the Wei Wu Army.
         When they saw Li Hao, those Qian fighters who had been unconvinced in the past were convinced.
         Even Chen Jin, the successor of the mountain splitting axe, who was his enemy, no longer felt disgruntled or hostile toward Li Hao. There were only emotions, sighs, regret, and ... An indescribable feeling.
         Silver moon's 36 heroes had quite a few members of the second and third generation. He was part of the second generation, but so was Li Hao. However, Li Hao was too young, even younger than some of the third generation.
         But now, Li Hao's demonic sword was widely acknowledged.
          Strong!
         It was the kind that was extremely powerful, the kind that could kill those in the transformation stage.
         He couldn't accept it.
         "Governor li!"
         Everyone addressed him by his official title. Li Hao laughed. "You're welcome. Call me Li Hao, or Regiment commander li ... We're all Silvermoon citizens, and we're colleagues ..."
         In the past, he didn't think much of the Wei Wu Army.
         However, when compared to the people around them, this was a group of true martial masters. They could be considered the true soldiers of this era. When they fought Pirates, they would take revenge on the spot, face to face.
         They didn't say anything after they finished fighting the Pirates, just silently guarding them.
         Back then, Li Hao had thought that this was nothing.
         Shouldn't they be fighting Pirates?
         Was there anything worthy of praise?
         But today ... He smiled. It was really worthy of praise. In this era, there were actually still troops who were willing to kill Pirates and protect an area ... It was really rare.
         Therefore, in an instant, the anger and anger in his heart dissipated a lot.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com These people had sparred with him in the open.
         If there was hostility, he would say it on the spot.
         Compared to them, the smiling Tigers of the nine divisions were the most disgusting.
         They were scheming against each other, smiling on the surface, but secretly, they wanted to take your life.
         "I don't dare to."
         Chen Jin sighed with emotion."You should just call me Governor. We Silver Moon martial masters are also ranked by seniority. Who's stronger and who's more ruthless? you're also of higher seniority. You're the direct descendant of the five bird Kings, and the last disciple of the number one of the Silver Moon's 36 heroes ... My status is not as high as yours."
         Li Hao laughed,"you must be joking."
         "It is."
         Chen Jin didn't really care about this, but he said regretfully, "It's a pity that my master was killed by your master ... Otherwise, the people of the southern Fist can actually show off their power now. My poor master ... Sigh!"
         Sighing, he still felt some regret.  Mountain breaker axe, one of the thirty-six people.
         However, he had died.
         The people that Yuan Shuo had killed were not weak. Under normal circumstances, they would not be able to stop. This proved that the mountain splitting axe was very strong.
         Unfortunately, he had died too early.
         Li Hao felt a little awkward. Now that he had met more Silver Moon martial masters, he felt a little awkward.
         If it was in the past, it wouldn't matter. He was just a person he didn't know.
         However, as more and more Silver Moon martial masters appeared, he realized that these people might have all sorts of problems, but they were all honest and upright. At least, they were much better than the others.
         Jin Jin replied indifferently,"it's done! A bunch of Silver Moon martial masters died when we sparred, and I've killed many of them. If you're capable, then challenge me for revenge ... If you're not, then shut up. Why are you saying all this?"
         Everyone was silent.
         Li Hao coughed and looked at the martial masters. There were nearly a thousand of them, which was quite a number.
         Li Hao didn't say much."I have some storage rings here that need to be checked. Everyone, please help me. Put the divine power stones, spring of life, and origin divine weapons in a separate pile. Help me sort out the other miscellaneous items. Separate them into different categories ...
         Everyone was speechless!
         Jin Jin was also speechless. He looked at Li Hao with an unsightly expression.
         Just this?
         Why did you make such a big fuss?
         The next moment, he shut up.
         In an instant, Li Hao took out thousands of storage rings, which left everyone dumbfounded.
         All the martial masters widened their eyes in shock.
         Jin Jin's mouth was wide open ...'Luckily, I didn't say anything. Otherwise, I'd be so embarrassed.'
         That's right, with so many, if he didn't ask for the help of a thousand people, how long would it take for one person to organize?
         There were thousands of people, so a few pills each would be enough.
         However, since when could the spoils of storage rings be calculated in thousands? he couldn't help but ask,""Those people ... Are you not going to return them?"
          He knew where these things came from.
         However, Li Hao had actually taken them all.
         "Return?"
         Li Hao laughed,"there's no good person on the four islands, what do you mean by" return "?" As for the Heavenly Star Douluo arena, there aren't many good people there. If they can return alive, I'll be showing them extra mercy!"
         "Then ... I've offended too many people ..."
         Golden spear hesitated.
         Li Hao seemed to have noticed something. He suddenly sneered,""Offended too many people? I have a sword in my hand, why would I be afraid of them? A Silver Moon Martial Master had always been a result of fighting! Among the 36 heroes, Black Widow was despised by others because she did not rely on fighting, but on sleeping! What are you thinking about?"
         Li Hao said coldly,"I've finally understood that strength is the only thing that matters in this era!" I'm fearless, so I'll break the fear in my heart. No one can lead my life. If I'm afraid, then I wouldn't have come to stellarsky city!"
         "Golden spear senior, you're old!"
         Li Hao looked straight at him."None of the 36 heroes I've met are afraid of me! He didn't know how to use the southern Fist, he didn't know how to use the earth overturning sword, he didn't know how to use the light sword, and even Yu Luosha didn't know how to use it! The only ones who are afraid are the Black Widow and the Golden Gun!"
        
         BOOM!
         The Spear's consciousness burst forth. At this moment, the Golden spear was furious, sullen, manic, and even a little crazy.
         He could not accept such humiliation!
         Jin Jin gritted his teeth and clenched his fists as he looked at Li Hao. Everyone else could clearly feel the sullen feeling he was feeling.
         "Li Hao ..."
         Jin Jin looked at Li Hao and gritted his teeth so hard that he even started to bleed."You're right ... No one is afraid of a Silver Moon Martial Master! They won't ... I won't either ... Black spider ... Are you saying that I, who relied on Minister hou to get to where I am today, is the same as her relying on Ying Hongyue?"
         Li Hao did not say anything.
         Jin Jin was a little mad. In the end, he snorted coldly and turned to leave.
         He knew that Li Hao was trying to provoke him.
         But ... He was really triggered.
          He was furious!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He didn't care about the provocation of the southern style. Fine, he did care.
         However, he couldn't accept the fact that a junior like Li Hao was comparing him to black spider, a Martial Master who relied on sleeping with men to get to the top, or even to the same level as him. He felt like he was going crazy.
         Li Hao, you're too much!
         He was a little irascible and even wanted to stab Li Hao to death!
         He looked down on women like the green peacock, the heavenly Mountain goddess, and black spider. He felt that they were not worthy of being martial masters and would lose the face of martial masters. He rose to his position by relying on Ying Hongyue, but he also looked down on women like the heart-jabbing tender. He became famous by wandering between men ...
         But after hearing Li Hao's words, he thought about it and realized that perhaps in the eyes of Southern Fist and the others, he was the same as them.
         It was all the same!
         You, golden spear, what right do you have to look down on me?
         Jin Jin was on the verge of breaking down. He was afraid that he would lose control if he did not leave now.
         ……
         Mu Lin glanced at Li Hao and sighed,""Don't go too far. The boss of the Golden Gun gang hasn't been very normal recently. He's almost on the verge of a mental breakdown. After what you said tonight ... I'm afraid he won't be able to take it!"
         Li Hao sighed and said softly,"to Jin Jin gun, if he can't overcome his inner demons and surpass himself, he'll be stuck here for the rest of his life ... He'd rather die!" Among the 36 people, even now, he might not be the weakest ... But his mentality might be the worst. From what I know, killing blade and jade light sword are both in a better state than him. "
         "If this continues ... It's better to die. This is a form of torture for a Martial Master. He will never be able to break Minister hou's will ..."
         As soon as he said that, none of the thousands of martial masters present retorted.
         Yes, it was.
         Perhaps ... Li Hao was right.
         To the Golden spear, the head of the Silver Moon three Spears, and Yuan Shuo was undoubtedly the first in the rankings.
         The second was sky sword, and the third was a little controversial. Some people said domineering blade, some said Northern fist, and some said golden spear ...
         In any case, in that era, the Golden spear was the most powerful.
         However ... In this era, the Golden spear was just a golden spear, not a Silver Moon Martial Master that he couldn't afford to offend. The difference was too great. With such a difference, as more and more powerful martial masters appeared, if this continued, he would be killed, or he would completely collapse.
         Therefore, at this moment, these martial masters could actually understand.
         Chen Jin also let out a sigh."A thousand-man commander ... Sigh!"
         No longer saying anything, in order to break the dead silence, Mu Lin laughed and shouted,"Come, each of you take a few. You're not allowed to pocket them, do you hear me? Don't embarrass our Silver Moon Martial Master, and don't embarrass the Wei Wu Army ..."
          Someone sneered."Forget it. The Wei Wu Army is fine, but the Silver Moon Martial Master ... It depends on who he is. It's said that the southern style has done many such immoral things."  “……”
         "Cough, cough, cough!"
         Someone coughed, and someone poked the person who had spoken and cursed in a low voice,""Idiot, the southern Fist ... Killed the metahuman with one punch!"
         “……”
         In an instant, the person who spoke sobered up and immediately laughed dryly. "I'm just joking. Senior Southern Fist is very powerful. He's super powerful. It's all just rumors. Nonsense!"
         Li Hao wanted to laugh.
         He held it in.
         The reputation of the southern style did not seem to be very good.
         Like a hooligan ... Fine, actually, it's almost the same now.
         Brother ermu, please help me with the summary. I'll go back first to meet our minister."
         "Don't worry!"
         "With me here, there won't be any missing items. Oh right, the storage ring ..." Mu Lin said.
         "One pill each!"
         Li Hao laughed."After counting them, the storage rings are empty. I have no use for them. Each of you can take one."
         Everyone was overjoyed!
         To them, even a storage ring was a treasure. Among those present, other than a few Centurions and a few who had broken through the 100th level, almost no one else had one.
         Furthermore, this was something he had obtained after coming to stellarsky city. In Silver Moon, the few Centurions did not even have a few of them.
         At this moment, everyone was equipped with it.
         All of a sudden, everyone's spirits were lifted. They were overjoyed and shouted,""Thank you for the reward, Governor!"
         ……
         Next door.
         Hou Xiaochen had just returned, and when he heard the roar, he was stunned for a moment. After a while, he laughed and cursed, "You're not a thing ..."
         Chief Steward Yu looked at him.
          "I'm the main post, and he's the Vice Governor!"Hou Xiaochen didn't know whether to laugh or cry. I'm almost invisible now. "
         The star military governor's office was nowhere to be seen.
         As a result, Li Hao, the governor of Heavenly Star, became famous.
         Also, did this guy bribe the Wei Wu Army again?
         What, do you still want to target the Wei Wu Army?
         ……
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had no time to care about that.
         At this moment, he threw down his storage ring and headed straight for Yao SI's office building.
         It was his first time here, so he should pay his respects to the dock.
         They had never met before, but with just a glance, he knew that the other party was not weak.
        
         The department head's office.
         Secretary Xiao Ye knocked on the door respectfully and led Li Hao in. She didn't dare to say anything and quickly left.
         "Greetings, Minister."
         Li Hao was very polite, even though he didn't think there was a need to be polite. However, they were in the other party's territory.
         Yao si drank his tea and smiled. He pointed at the chair: "Let's sit down and talk. "
         "Many thanks!"
         Li Hao sat down casually.
         Yao si looked at him and laughed: "young heroes. Since ancient times, heroes come from the young. Compared to you, we are all old."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Minister, you're too kind."
         "You're too kind,"
          Yao si smiled and glanced at Li Hao. He didn't say anything and only sighed,""When the nine divisions wanted to set up the night watchers to manage the transcendents in the world and deal with the three major organizations, which were becoming more and more ambitious, I was the first one to step up and take over the mess with the power of a Martial Master."
         "However, the more I did, the more helpless and hesitant I became ... There were too many restrictions, too many scruples, and too many constraints. I couldn't do it!
         He sighed."I'm old, after all. I'm not as good as you guys. You guys have the drive. I had it back then, but it's gone."
         "I just want to say a few words when I see you. By the way, what do you think of me?"
         "Ah?"
         "I said, what was your first impression of me?"
         "Kind, affable, and amiable ..."
         Li Hao chuckled. His smile was somewhat professional. He had learned the professional smile after working in the inspection Office for a year.
         Yao si laughed,"it's too fake, can't you just tell the truth?" I'm old, and I like young people to tell the truth. Don't worry, I'm not the Secretary of the ninth Division, why would I be angry with you?"
         Li Hao was silent for a while. Then, he smiled and said softly,""Minister, do you really want me to say it?"
         "Just say it."
         "As the saying goes, there are many constraints, scruples, and restrictions ... In short, they are afraid of death, choose to lie down, forget their original intentions, and be assimilated. They are malfeasted and incompetent, but they still want to find excuses for themselves. Sometimes, malfeasance is more terrible than a wrong plan. At least they are doing it, but malfeasance is not at all."
         Li Hao was a little unscrupulous. Perhaps it was because the other party's false words made him uncomfortable, or perhaps it was because he was stronger and more confident. Since the other party wanted to say it, he would not be polite.
         "The night patrollers ... Are so rotten! I thought that the Silver Moon Nightwalker was terrible, but compared to this place ... The Silver Moon Nightwalker is really dedicated to his work. It's a pity that he doesn't even get paid. How miserable!"
         "The night patrolmen have no system, no clue, and no sense of responsibility. They take high wages, go to the four islands to eat, drink, and gamble, watch the big demons eat people, watch the Pirates beside them, pretend to be deaf and mute, and even call them brothers ... Hehe!"  Li Hao mocked, sneered, and looked at him with disdain.
         He had wanted to be more polite, but this person seemed to want to explain his suffering, his unwillingness, his sorrow ...
         He seemed to want to tell Li Hao that he was also a hot-blooded person back then!
         I was appointed to the task at the critical moment!
         But ... Li Hao wanted to laugh. He said,""I'm also thinking, if the three major organizations become the rulers of the world, will they be worse? Not necessarily! The three major organizations have killed many people ... In the past, I thought that they were unpardonable, but after looking at it ... The number of people who died at the hands of the three major organizations might not be as many as the number of innocent people who died at your hands. What right do you have to judge the three major organizations?"
         "You're very bold!"
         Yao si sat up straight. He was somewhat surprised, but not angry. He was just surprised, surprised at Li Hao's boldness!
         "You have to know that here ... I'm the leader after all!"
         He looked at Li Hao and said indifferently,"not even Huang Long would dare to talk to me like that."
         Li Hao laughed and nodded."That's right. A person who didn't dare to talk to you like that caused the night patrolmen to be in such a foul mood ... You might say that I was just deliberately making a fuss for him. But you have to know that because you kept a low profile, the night patrolmen have completely rotted down. They're rotten to the core! Do you know what it means when a law enforcement agency is completely rotten? It meant that ... Ordinary people actually had no place to seek justice anymore. In this world ... There was no fairness or justice to speak of! You people bear a great responsibility for the decay of the dynasty!"
         "Li Hao,"
         The old man looked at him, a little confused,"are these important to you?" I thought that you would take advantage of this meeting to hope that I could help you. Why ... Did you choose to treat me like this?"
         Li Hao looked at him."Because I can feel it. I can feel it a little. A Crooked Stick will have a crooked shadow!" Soldiers bear a bear, a general bear a nest! You're a general, you're the leader of the only powerful organization other than the nine divisions! If you were a hidden expert, if you were the martial masters of Silvermoon, if you were the leader of the seven divine mountains, if you were the leader of the three great organizations ... I would have praised you a little ... But you are not!"
         Li Hao also laughed."You're the leader of the entire night patrolmen. You don't even care about it. You let the yellow Dragons show off and let the night patrolmen defile you ... In my eyes, your sins are greater than many others!"
          "Sinful?"
         Yao Si was stunned for a moment. Sin ...
         He looked at Li Hao for a long time before saying,"you said ... I'm sinful?."
         "Right!"
         Yao Si was stunned. He didn't expect this, he really didn't expect this.
         He didn't expect Li Hao to give him such an evaluation.
         He was a sinner!
         He had never thought that in his life, there would be a day when he would be scolded by a young man in front of him, saying that he was a sinner.
         The source of evil!
         "Li Hao, you don't understand," he said softly,"lying low is for a better outburst ..."
