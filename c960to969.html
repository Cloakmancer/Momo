        acher had already given him some hints and theories.  Next, Li Hao only needed to overcome a few difficulties, such as how to use the power of the superpower lock to nourish his internal organs and force. He couldn't just eat without vomiting!
         If that was the case, other than himself, who could use the sword energy to strengthen himself, and other than the blood God ... Could it be that normal martial artists were not qualified to accumulate spirit energy?
         The teacher had said that the path that everyone could cultivate on was the true path of martial arts.
         That was a realm!
         Therefore, the current realm of Martial Master was still the limit of thousand-man fighting. The paths above it were actually not conventional paths. The spirit accumulation realm was only used by Yuan Shuo and Li Hao. Others were not qualified to use it.
         "The key lies in the Super Lock."
         Li Hao thought to himself. At this moment, he had almost finished eating all the spirit accumulation fruits, and his four forces had become stronger. However, Li Hao was still not satisfied. This was not enough.
         If the four forces were a bit stronger, and his physical body was stronger to the level of ten thousand square meters, perhaps he could completely surpass hai Sha from before. However, he would definitely not be able to beat a late-stage sunguang.
         On the other hand, the faceless shark was in the late stage of the rising light realm. The White shark was either in the peak stage or, like the Golden Eagle and the others, in the metamorphosis stage ... Li Hao didn't think the possibility of it being in the metamorphosis stage was high.
          At the current stage, only Hong Yitang and the others seemed to be at this level. Before these people were unsealed, their maximum power was more or less like this. It was the transformation stage, a stage in the process of transformation.
         With Li Hao's current strength, it was impossible for him to match white shark.
         As for Gou 'Zi, Li Hao could tell that he might not be able to kill a late-stage sunguang in a one-on-one fight, but he should be close to that level. He could be killed with a sneak attack.
         He should be slightly stronger than him, but not by much.
         It would be hard for him and Gou 'Zi to achieve anything against an expert who knew that he had killed a late-stage Sunglow realm expert.
         "Moreover, it's not necessarily just Xuguang. There are still the three suns. Many ants can kill an elephant ... At this stage, looking for trouble with the White shark Pirates would be courting death."
         Li Hao gently waved the small sword like a willow leaf fluttering in the wind. Li Hao frowned. The Willow catkin sword required him to comprehend the force of wood. He felt that it would take him a long time.
         This was because he felt that it was a bit awkward to use the Willow catkin sword after the other four forces had become stronger.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Five birds technique ..."
         Li Hao then thought of the five birds technique. In the five birds technique, Yuan Shuo's deer force corresponded to wood force.
         However, everyone had their own ideas on how to correspond the deer stance to the wood stance. Yuan Shuo's idea was different from Li Hao 'S. Li Hao felt that the deer mind control technique should correspond to the wind Stance.
         However, when it came to wood force, he really couldn't link it together. He couldn't just say that it was wood attribute just because it ate grass, right?
         This also required him to comprehend it himself.
         For example, Yuan Shuo's Tiger was a Water Tiger, while Li Hao's was a fire Tiger.
         "The ape technique corresponds to the force of wood. I can still make some connections. After all, he's an expert in climbing trees and walking in the forest ..."
         Thinking of this, Li Hao smiled.
         He didn't think too much about it and continued reading. Perhaps the ancient book would give him some hints and insights.
         The sky outside had completely darkened.
         The owner of the small Tavern didn't dare to rush the guest who had occupied the best private room, because ... The owner recognized who it was and didn't dare to drive him away.
          Of course, he couldn't help but complain in his heart that she was so stingy.  A pot of wine and some pastries, you can eat for a whole day ... You're a Big Shot, after all, so why are you so poor?
         If he wasn't afraid that the other party would think that he was looking down on him, the boss would have sent some fruits up. He had been sitting here for a whole day and only ordered so little. It was really shabby.
         The sky turned dark and the neon lights outside were all lit up.
         Only then did Li Hao go downstairs.
         "General, would you like to have some?" the tavern owner hurriedly came forward.
         "No need,"
         Li Hao smiled and took out a hundred star dollar.""A pot of wine and a serving of tea and snacks, is that enough?"
         “……”
         The tavern owner was speechless. It was enough ... But ... Forget it!
         You haven't calculated the room fee yet.
         "It's enough, it's enough. I even gave you more!"
         "It's not easy to do business, it's what I should do. "
         Li Hao paid the money and left. As he walked out of the tavern, he sighed. Going south was really expensive. It actually cost 100 star coins. He thought back to the time when he was an inspector ... Oh, it was only a few months ago. During his internship, it was only 1000 star coins a month.
         If he drank 10 bottles of wine, his salary would be gone.
         He shook his head. No wonder it could feed 30 million people. The consumption level was really high. It was enough for me to eat a big meal in Silver City.
         After leaving the tavern, Li Hao wasn't in a hurry to go to the beach.
         He began to wander around the city. It was rare for him to have such a mood, such thoughts, and such leisure time. It was not bad to experience the feasting and revelry of the South and cleanse his soul.
         Compared to going south, he thought of the small town by the river that he had seen today ...
          Li Hao chuckled. He had never felt this way before, but now that he looked at it again, Silver moon's side was really not bad.
         ……
         On this day, Li Hao was wandering South.
         On this day, the members of the demon hunt squads were also eating and drinking to their hearts "content, having a carefree time.
         ……
         At this moment, in white moon City.
         A few higher-ups started a video conference.
         A crystal-like screen projected a few figures.
         Kong Jie leaned back on her office chair, feeling a little tired. She looked at the people on the screen."Last night, Li Hao Ran away. Didn't you guys feel anything?"
         On the big screen, Huang Yu raised his eyebrows."No, I didn 't,"
        
         "That means there's a problem with Silver moon's system!"
         "We've been defending against superpowers, but martial masters ... Are the real threat!"Kong Jie said. If Li Hao and the others can leave without a sound, it means that martial masters can invade without a sound!"
         Huang Yu nodded slightly and did not argue. After some consideration, he said,""The precautions against martial masters are indeed not strict enough. I'll think about it, and the military will strengthen their targeting of martial masters. "
         After saying that, he didn't harp on this and asked,""The faceless shark and the sea shark were killed by Li Hao?"
         "That Black Dog is here. It might be the Black Dog's doing."
         "That's a great demon ..." Huang Yu hesitated,""Why would there be a diremonster in Silvermoon? It doesn't belong to the superpower system yet, but it feels a little ... Like the Martial Master System. "
         At the side, director Zhao coughed lightly and his figure pressed down on Huang Yu,""Perhaps they are descendants of ancient Fey. Their bloodline is stronger than humans. There might be some ancient Fey descendants on Silvermoon's side. You've all seen that dog's information. Li Hao took it in by accident ... It's located in Silver City. Since Silver City has the bloodline of the eight great families, it's normal for it to have the inheritance of the descendants of ancient demons. "
         The few of them nodded.
         Kong Jie didn't say much. After some consideration, she said,""With hou Xiaochen gone, there's been some problems with our four-faction system. Originally, old Zhao was in charge of internal affairs, old Huang was in charge of external enemies, I was in charge of the city's security, and old hou was in charge of mobility and cleaning up the mess ..."
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "But with old hou gone, The Night Watcher system will lack power and important powerhouses to make decisions ... Hao lianchuan is too weak ..."
         Kong Jie continued,"I originally recommended Wang Heng to take over, but old hou didn't agree. Before he left, he caught us off guard and insisted on Li Hao taking over. Li Hao isn't weak, but I used to think that Li Hao ... Wasn't very good!"
         "He's the same as his master. It's fine for him to travel alone, but it's not reliable for them to take on some responsibilities. If Hong Yitang is willing ... Once old hou leaves, he will take over. I think he's the best candidate, but he's not willing ..."
         "So ..." Kong Jie continued,"I think we might have seen some hope and change this time. I'm considering whether to include Li Hao in this system and restore silver moon's Square system."
         Inspection Division, night patrol, Garrison, and administration Bureau.
         The four organizations had been in charge of Silver Moon for many years.
         Bringing Li Hao into this system meant that he recognized Li Hao's position. In the future, he would replace hou Xiaochen and become the head of Silver moon's law enforcement agency.
         The moment he said that, even director Zhao frowned,""No! It was too fast! Don't think that Li Hao can take on heavy responsibilities just because of one operation. It's not appropriate! As a member of the eight great families, we also hope that he can protect this ancient Holy Land ... But ... The current him is not strong enough, not experienced enough, not thoughtful enough, not deep enough ... He is still far from it. "  Huang Yu also frowned."Kong, you're being too frivolous. Li Hao did well this time, but that's all. It's not necessarily a good thing to push Li Hao to the top in one operation."
         Kong Jie thought for a while and nodded,"that's true!" The White shark Pirates won't give up so easily. They're strong on one hand, and behind them is the Jiang family, right?"
         "I'm not too sure, but it's a possibility. "
         "What do you mean?" Huang Yu asked.
         "No matter what, the White shark Pirates have to find Li Hao for revenge. Otherwise, they won't be able to establish themselves in the North Sea. Sooner or later, they will be swallowed up by the other seven families ... So, I want to see how Li Hao will deal with this. He caused trouble, but he said that he will solve this problem ... I'm thinking, if we don't do anything, Li Hao can solve the problem of the White shark Pirates. Will he be able to join us?"
         “……”
          The two of them looked at him. After a while, director Zhao smiled,""It's possible ... But on the condition that Hong Yitang doesn't interfere. Li Hao has a good relationship with Hong Yitang, and Hong Yitang's daughter is also on his team. If Hong Yitang takes action ... It'll be meaningless."
         "What we need is someone who can solve the problem and quickly put it out, not someone who can create trouble but can't do anything about it," Huang Yu added seriously."If that's the case, it'll only bring Silver Moon a lot of trouble. The higher his position is, the more trouble he'll be in!"
         He agreed, but there was a condition. Li Hao had to solve the problem of the White shark Pirates himself. This could also be considered a test.
         After a while, Kong Jie suddenly smiled and said,""What do you guys think ... If we let him join, he might not be willing?"
         "It doesn't matter," Huang Yu said indifferently."It's a voluntary thing. A forced melon is not sweet. If they're really unwilling, they can't join!"
         Director Zhao also nodded his head.
         Kong Jie stopped talking about Li Hao and continued,""Also, old hou ... I'm afraid he'll be in big trouble. He left on his own. Even though he took Jin gun and the others, that's the central region. The yellow Dragon probably doesn't want to see old hou gain a foothold and gain a firm foothold there ... Since old hou didn't say anything, should we do something?"
         He looked at the two of them, as if waiting for them to make a decision.
         Huang Yu frowned and fell into deep thought.
        
         Director Zhao seemed to be writing something. When he felt that the atmosphere had quieted down, he raised his head and saw the two of them looking at him. He smiled."Why are you looking at me?"
         "Old Zhao, you don't have any ideas?"
         "Me?"
         Director Zhao was helpless."What can I do? furthermore, little hou isn't weak. Don't be too worried ..."
         Kong Jie chuckled,"you, your mind ... Sigh!" Wasn't it just some disputes? I just don't think the same as you. "You're all-inclusive and open to all sides. If he's not willing and doesn't listen to you, you can just ignore him. Why do you have to make him agree with you ..."
         Director Zhao laughed,"what are you saying, when did I force him to agree with me?."
         "Alright, alright, alright!"
         Kong Jie didn't say much and directly said,""Do you have any ideas? if not, I'm hanging up. Seeing how busy you are, people who don't know better might think that you're busy with something important. Actually, Silver Moon doesn't have anything important to do recently ..."
         "What do you know!"
         "Shut up!" Director Zhao scolded,"you only know how to open your mouth and then not care about anything!"
          Kong Jie was too lazy to reply.
         Director Zhao thought for a moment before saying,"if he goes to the central region, we won't be able to help him ... There's not much we can do ... How about this? I'll use my identity as Silver moon's highest Administrative Director to send a private letter to skysword." As a Silvermoon being, if you run into any trouble ... Let's see if Tian Jian is willing to help. "
         "That guy ..."
         When Kong Jie heard him say this, she thought of something and nodded.""This is good! I heard that BA Dao is still alive. Do you know where he is?"
         "I don't know,"
         Director Zhao shook his head. Huang Yu thought about it and said,""BA Dao ... Almost everyone who has seen BA Dao is dead. However, BA Dao might be looking for Yuan Shuo now. "
         "What?"
         "Have you forgotten that the Zhang family's knife is in Yuan Shuo's hands?"
         Huang Yu revealed a meaningful look: "with BA Dao's personality, he is extremely overbearing. If he knew that the eight great families" saber had fallen into Yuan Shuo's hands, he might be interested and go find Yuan Shuo to spar with him."
         "I'm afraid that Yuan Shuo is no match for BA Dao. "
         "It's hard to say,"
         Huang Yu shook his head."Yuan Shuo's spirit accumulation stage ... If he can reach the advanced level ... There's still hope. Five Forces combined, nurture Five Forces. If BA Dao is like us, he might not win if he doesn't unseal it!"
         "Forget it, that's hard to find anyway."  Kong Jie did not say anything else."Then let's write a letter to Tian Jian first. Other than Tian Jian, let me think ... Who else is in the central region?"
         He thought for a moment and said,""Is the northern fist in the central region? Or did he go somewhere else? Like the Li Dynasty?"
         "I don't know,"
         "I'm not sure,"
         "Forget it," Kong Jie could not help but complain."You guys have too little information. Silver Moon and the others are too good at running. The only one who has a clear location now is skysword. That guy's always showing off, but that's good. At least we'll be able to find him."
         The others were all elusive and hard to find.
         "I don't think we need to worry too much about hou Xiaochen."
         Director Zhao casually said,"Yu Luosha and Jin gun are both following. Yu Luosha is quite strong. Jin gun ..."
         He hesitated for a moment."Let's wait and see about Jin gun. He's in a state of self-doubt now. If he can't get out of here ... Jin gun ... Is half-crippled. This is the only way."
         ? He shook his head, feeling that it was a pity.
         "I'm going to let killing blade leave for the central region," Huang Yu said."He'll be crippled if he stays here any longer."
         The two of them didn't say anything. It was up to you.
          "Where's the light sword?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Kong Jie thought for a moment and said,"she went to the Xu family ... I'm afraid it's to solve the problem of her cultivation technique. This time, Xu Feng was killed. Although I don't know the details, it may be related to a treasure of the Xu family. Will she do something?"
         "It's beyond my reach!"
         Director Zhao replied,"we can 't. They won't be controlled by us. We can only take one step at a time." Before Nanquan left, he told me to make preparations for the expansion of swords gate, and everything within a thousand miles will become swords gate's territory. Nanquan and hongyitang seemed to have come to an agreement ... What do you guys think?"
         Both of them were stunned. Huang Yu frowned, and Kong Jie thought for a while before saying,""I can't say for sure, and I'm not sure about Hong Yitang's purpose. We can discuss it properly. Li Hao will go and ask ... What do you guys think?"
         The two of them looked at each other and nodded.
         After roughly confirming Silver moon's recent events, Huang Yu finally spoke,""I'll have the military completely seal off the crosscut Canyon and won't allow anyone to enter or leave for the time being. There's been some movement in heaven battling city, and I think Li Hao will have to solve this problem sooner or later. "
         After saying this, they didn't talk anymore and quickly ended the call.
         As for Li Hao, he was temporarily confirmed to be one of the candidates for the leader of the Nightwatchers.
         At this time, Li Hao obviously didn't know about this, let alone that he might be promoted again. At this time, he was still traveling South, watching a group of long-legged girls dancing on the roadside in the middle of the night ... Li Hao was impressed. The weather was a little cold, but they weren't afraid of their legs freezing.
        
         A day of indulgence.
         The next day, everyone gathered at the coast.
         Hong Qing and Hong Hao weren't back yet. Swords gate was a little far away, but it would take less than two days to get there by car.
         At this moment, other than them, the others had all arrived.
         Li Hao looked around and his eyes flickered.
         In the crowd, many people could feel a weak force stirring. This was not considered a complete force, but just like Li Hao's comprehension of Earth Force, it was already in its embryonic form, which meant that he was not far from comprehending true force.
         Very soon, these people would be able to break through to the completion of the 100-star level.
         On swords gate's side, four to five of them were in the same situation.
         On the side of the inspection Office, there were also a few people who showed such signs. Liu Yan, Wu Chao, Chen Jian, and a few others could also vaguely feel the embryonic form of power.
         Li Hao gently exhaled.
          The effect was not bad.
         Fighting was indeed the best way for a Martial Master to cultivate.
         In a few days, this small team might have about 10 people who had broken through 100%.
         As for entering the thousand warrior tier, he needed to build up his momentum.
         Other than momentum, these people had met all the other requirements. Be it their physical body, five internal organs, Qi, blood, bones, and bones ... These people were far beyond ordinary martial masters, so it was not a big problem.
         Out of the 50 people, one-fifth of them had broken through 100. This was already very good.
         One had to know that the Wei Wu Army had been established for many years, and only one-tenth of them had broken through 100 levels. Moreover, many of them had advanced through the Dao Comprehension ancient weapon.
         "After a day of indulgence, it's time to go."
         Li Hao looked at everyone."We'll return to white moon City to rest for three days. During this time, I'll give you all the ancient weapons of enlightenment that the Wei Wu Army left behind. It's up to you to comprehend them or not." The Shi in these ancient weapons might not be what everyone wants and can only be used as a reference, but it will still be helpful in comprehending Shi. "
         "Three days later ... I'll bring everyone to explore a historical site!"
         After Li Hao finished speaking, he added, in ten days, we must set sail again! The White shark Pirates are probably in a period of chaos. Logically speaking, if we go and cause trouble now, we might be able to gain some advantages. But in my opinion, that's not important. As long as everyone's strength increases, we don't have to worry about them finishing their unification. "
         At this moment, he had two choices.
         The first was to find the White shark Pirates and take the initiative to cause trouble. His divine boat was very fast, so he might be able to take advantage of it.
         The second was to return and explore the ruins left behind by the Golden spear.
         Li Hao chose the second option.
         The White shark Pirates were right there, so there was no rush. They would not dare to act rashly for the next few days. They would at least have to wait for a while, or else they would be worried that Silver Moon would deliberately set up a trap to harm them.  Therefore, Li Hao wanted to explore the ruins left behind by the Golden spear during this time.
         Perhaps there would be some gains.
         It was not convenient for Li Hao to touch the remains of heaven battling city. The heaven battling Army there was powerful, and strictly speaking, the eight major cities were all his, so he shouldn't dig up their graves.
         Of course, this was just his own thoughts.
         Li Hao laughed."Some of you haven't been to the remains before. It's good to take a look and broaden your horizons. If you're lucky, you might gain something. If you're unlucky, you might face some danger. But martial masters still have to take risks."
         No one had any objections.
         Only excitement!
         Most of these people had never entered the ruins before. Only a few of them had. They knew that there were many treasures in the ruins, but they didn't know what they were like.
         "In these three days, everyone will work hard to improve themselves. Comprehending force is a hurdle, a huge hurdle! "Only by comprehending force can everyone go further. If we are unable to comprehend it ..."
         Li Hao looked at them and was silent for a while.""You'll be eliminated sooner or later! Breaking through 100 is too weak. After comprehending Shi and breaking through the body's limits, you can walk many paths. For example, learning the southern Fist, learning the Golden spear, learning my master ... There's still a path ahead. "
         However, if one did not comprehend force, they would be stuck there for life. No matter how strong they were, they would only be over a hundred. Their physical limits were not broken, and they would be at their limit if they could deal with the sunlight.
         In the current situation, breaking through 100 ... If not for the fact that they all had Black Phoenix, they would not even be able to participate in the battle to exterminate the Pirates.
         As soon as he said that, everyone suddenly felt a sense of danger!
         If this continued ... Would there still be a place for them in this team?
         There were very few people in the team, only about 50 people.
          Therefore, Li Hao was now generous enough to share any attribute with them, such as the ancient weapons of enlightenment, the divine power stones, the black banner ...
         These people were improving rapidly.
         However, if they were eliminated ...
         It was unimaginable!
         In an instant, a wave of pressure forced everyone to return to reality from yesterday's indulgence.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, someone hesitated and said,""Captain, if we can comprehend force from the Enlightenment ancient weapon, will it affect our future? Is his potential not as good as the others?"
         Li Hao thought for a while and said,"not necessarily!" Comprehending force is like knocking on a door. It doesn't mean that I won't be able to become stronger in the future, and it doesn't mean that I'll definitely become stronger in the future. The sword force that I've comprehended is actually ... It's a kind of Dao-understanding ancient weapon. "
         "However, the Shi You comprehend from your weapon might not necessarily be the most compatible with you."
         At this moment, Chen Jian also opened his mouth and said honestly,"Captain, for example, if a defensive-type Martial Master like me comprehended an offensive Shi, does that mean I'm crippled?"
         Li Hao laughed,"who said so?" 'Force' existed in one's imagination and was a manifestation of one's spirit. For example, if it's an earth element mountain, do you think a mountain is offensive or defensive?"
        
         "It's hard to say. "Chen Jian thought about it and shook his head.
         "Right, it's hard to say."
         Li Hao continued,"even if it's a powerful sword aura, who says that it must be offensive?" Don't you have any defensive ones? There were two sides to all of this. Don't define your Shi from the beginning! For example, when I first comprehended the terrain, my idea was to focus on the earth for defense, but later on, I turned the earth sword form into an offensive swordform ... It only depended on how it was used. "
         Everyone nodded in understanding.
         Even though he did not fully understand it, he roughly understood what Li Hao meant. No matter what, he had to first comprehend force and break through the barrier, breaking through the threshold of Qian Douluo. As for the rest ... Simply put, he would think about it later. If he did not cross the barrier now, it was unknown whether he would have a future.
         Since that was the case, he didn't have to consider too much about potential.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao continued,"everyone's strength has improved quite a bit. Now, 10 people in the late stage of surpassing 100 have joined forces. Using the ten-Ring Mountain-sealing array and the powerful armor, they can even fight against an early stage three sun cultivator ... The feeling they give me is not inferior to a battle led by a warrior of the thousand sun ... But, it's still not enough!"
         "You can only fight the three suns. You don't have the ability to kill them yet because you don't have the power and aren't strong enough to deter the three suns!"
         Everyone else nodded. They knew this as well.
         Even if they had joined forces and become stronger, they still lacked the necessary killing techniques to deal with the early stage of the three suns. At most, they could only hold the other party back. They could not kill the three suns at this stage.
          In fact, it was already very fast!
         However, they also knew that they had the help of the formation and the armor. Without the formation and the armor, it would be good enough if they could fight against a group of people in the middle and late stages of the glorious sun realm with 10 people in the late stage of the 100-realm.
         This was true combat strength.
         Of course, armors and formations were also a part of one's strength. Who asked others to not have them?
         "It's good that everyone understands what I mean. Let nature take its course. Some people don't need to worry too much about the power of the Dao Comprehension ancient weapon limiting your potential ..."
         Li Hao paused for a moment, then finally said,""The so-called potential being affected is nothing more than the difficulty of surpassing the ancients who left behind their power. But to be honest ... The chance ... Is slim!"
         It was the truth!
         In fact, Li Hao was well aware of the drawbacks of the Shi left behind by the ancient weapons.
         It was that, like the Golden spear, you would be enveloped by the ancient people's Shi, which could not be broken or surpassed.
         ,m But to put it bluntly ... The ancient civilization was so powerful and had so many ultimate experts. One could imagine how powerful they were for them to survive until today. Even Li Hao did not dare to hope that he could reach that step, to reach the step of his ancestors, let alone them.  He had also comprehended the ancestor's Shi, but so what?
         He would wait until he reached that step!
         Now, he was 108000 miles away from the other party, and he started to think,'Oh, I've comprehended my ancestor's Shi. If I can't break it in the future, I'll become the next golden spear ...'
         What a joke!
          With the strength of golden spear and rising light, how many people in the martial arts world were stronger than him?  However, after seeing the higher heaven and earth, one would feel that the Golden spear was limited.
         For the people in front of him, Li Hao felt that it was too difficult to surpass the ancients.
         Earthbound sword said that there was no need to feel that the present was inferior to the past, but that was his ambition, not reality. The reality was that even Li Hao and the others, if not for their bloodline, were only at the beginning of the black Vatican.
         After Li Hao said this, the crowd fell silent for a moment. Then, they suddenly let out a sigh of relief.
         "So that's how it is ... It's just that I can't surpass the ancient people ... That's good!"
         You scared us to death!
         He had thought that after comprehending the force of the Enlightenment ancient weapon, he would not be able to advance any further after reaching the thousand-warrior level, but ... That was not the case!
         "That's right. The team battle was just to scare us. We always thought that we would be stuck at the perfect breakthrough of one hundred or the universe crossing realm. Then, there would be no hope at all ... The ancient people were so powerful. It was said that the ancient people could destroy a star with just one move ..."
         Everyone chimed in, speechless at Li Hao.
         This was because Li Hao had said that the enlightened ancient weapon would have some restrictions and influence on them in the future. As a result, everyone was somewhat opposed to the greatest benefit that the Wei Wu Army had received.
         Everyone would rather slowly grind on their own than apply for this opportunity to gain enlightenment.
         It wasn't until this moment that everyone finally understood. Was this all there was to love?
         You're still trying to scare people with this?
          Li Hao was speechless.
         Before entering heaven battling city, Li Hao had actually ... Actually felt that the ancient people were only powerful like those in the legends. Ordinary people were very weak. Of course, he had also felt that he would definitely surpass those ordinary people ...
         In the end, after joining the heaven battling Army, he discovered that even today, countless years later, the silver armor could kill Li Hao ... Li Hao knew that he had overestimated himself.
         A million heaven-battling soldiers, a thousand men for one Regiment commander, and a thousand Regiment commanders ... In other words, at the current stage, even the silver Regiment commanders who had died countless years ago could beat Li Hao. So, there was no need to mention surpassing him.
         First imitate, then catch up, and then surpass.
         This was the path of today's people.
         Liu Long wanted to laugh when he saw Li Hao's embarrassment.
         In fact, everyone had the same thought in the beginning.
         Aren't we stronger than the ancient people?
         "We don't comprehend the Shi left behind by the ancient people. We must surpass it ...
        
         When they were beaten up by society, everyone would understand that it was still too early for them. They were just a toddler who was learning how to walk. Instead of learning from adults, they wanted to surpass them. What were they thinking?
         Below, there were whispers. Some people were thinking that they should borrow the Enlightenment ancient weapon to take a look when they returned.
         All 49 martial masters had entered the late-stage of breaking 100. If each of them tried once, it would be 49 times.
         On Li Hao's side, the strongest one was the broken sword that the Golden spear had left for him, which allowed him to comprehend it ten times. As for the rest, the Golden spear had left behind a few weaker ones, which could only be comprehended three to five times before they broke.
         It might not be enough for 49 people.
         However, Li Hao had also considered that those who relied on their own comprehension might not need to use it. That might be enough for everyone to comprehend it once.
         "Let's go, board the ship and set off! Hong Qing and the others will go directly to the White moon City. There's no need to wait for them!"
         The group of people quickly boarded the ship.
         The giant venomous divine boat expanded rapidly. Once the people got on the boat, it disappeared into the sea like an arrow.
         On the shore, someone was watching.
          He silently watched them leave.
         The two sunbrers of the Nightwalker branch were also looking at the elderly and the middle-aged man. The slightly older superhuman exclaimed,""Once the hou tribe left, everyone lost their backbone. Although the Hao tribe is also one of the three suns, as the number of powerhouses increased, it could not bring everyone a sense of security ... Now, before the hou tribe had completely left, this person had already displayed his powerful strength and determination to kill the enemy ... I believe that the entire Silver Moon Nightwalker will calm down in an instant and not be afraid of any chaos."
         Before this, everyone was actually still worried and apprehensive.
         But soon, Li Hao appeared. He killed two sunrise powerhouses and more than 500 supers, which gave everyone confidence. The Silvermoon Nightwalker was still as strong as ever.
         At this moment, it was still extremely important.
         And Hao lianchuan couldn't give them that. The head of the three yang intermediate stage ... Now, everyone was looking down on him.
         Beside him, the middle-aged man also chuckled and said,""Isn't that so? "I have to say that the hou Department has good eyes. Before they left, they made this person the Deputy Minister. I think ... He should be ..."
         "Cough cough!"
         The old man coughed."Hao bu is actually not bad. He's just a little weak. But he's a good person."
         "Yes, yes, yes!"
         The middle-aged man quickly nodded. This was not wrong. Hao lianchuan was a good person and he was a good person. It was not a bad idea to let things be like this. However, the Deputy Minister had to stand up. Otherwise, everyone would feel uncertain.
         ……
         At the same time.
         White moon City.
         At the night patrolman's encampment.
         Hao lianchuan was going crazy."I'm just asking. Ask my ass!" How would I know when Li Hao will be back? What are you all doing! I'm still here, why are you guys asking? it's not a big deal now, why are you guys always asking!"
         He flipped out at the few sunlight warriors in front of him!
         It was too infuriating!
         These guys had come to ask many times a day when Minister li would be back. This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Ask them what they wanted to do?
         This meant that there might still be strongholds of the three major organizations somewhere, and they needed the help of the Li Department.
         That person said,"is the Wei Wu Army still recruiting? he wants to introduce a friend to join."
         If not, it was because Department li could not stay in the Wei Wu Army all the time. After all, he was the Deputy Minister of the night patrol, so he had to come here to get to know everyone ...
         Hao lianchuan was about to die from anger!
         Do you think I'm dead?
         On the side, Minister Zhou of the metal element had also stepped into the three suns realm. Seeing his anger, he laughed,""Hao bu, everyone is doing this for the safety of the night patrollers. When the hou bu left, to be honest, everyone felt a little uneasy ... But now that the Li bu killed Xuguang, everyone is much more at ease. With an expert who can kill Xuguang here, it feels almost the same as when the hou bu was here. "Otherwise, no one would dare to eliminate the remaining members of the three major organizations ..."
         This was also a fact.
         It was a very helpless thing!
         "Am I not at the middle stage of the three yang realm?" Hao lianchuan said angrily. Can't they deal with some of the remaining evil? Who are you looking down on?"
         “……”
         No one spoke.
         Don't say, don't ask, if you ask ... You really look down on him.
         "Get lost, all of you!!"
         Hao lianchuan cursed for a while."I'll tell you when she's back. Now, get lost. Don't bother me!"
         “……”
         The group of people left in embarrassment. Hao lianchuan and the others left and leaned back in their chairs, looking helpless.
         Li Hao, this grandson, Pooh!
          When he came, he was so polite and even called him uncle Hao. But when he got stronger, he became so arrogant. He said that he would do something big and bring me along, but he just ran away without saying anything.
         Right now, demonic sword Li Hao's reputation was like the sun in the sky.
         He, Hao lianchuan, was so pitiful that he was about to become a background character. No, it was a green leaf. No, he was about to be worse than a green leaf.
         Isn't it infuriating?
         As he cursed in his heart, his eyes suddenly moved. He hurriedly looked at the door and was immediately overjoyed."Li Hao, you're back. Come, sit down and talk. Are you hungry? do you want to eat something? it's my treat ..."
         “……”
         Li Hao looked at him in confusion. What was going on?
         So enthusiastic?
         He had just settled the others down and came here directly.
         No matter what, he was still a Deputy Minister. In addition, Hao lianchuan had said that he wanted to go with them, so he had abandoned him. He had wanted to bring him along, but he thought that it was his first time out at sea, so he might not encounter Pirates ... Now, he was still thinking that Hao lianchuan had a stomach full of anger that he wanted to vent on him.
        
         Now, it seemed that it was still alright!
         "Hao bu ..." He said.
         "Call me brother!"
         How F * cked up!
         Li Hao was speechless. After a while, he said,""Don 't, I ... I'll just call you department head Hao, or ... Uncle Hao?"
         "No need, it's up to you!"
         "Are you hurt?" Hao lianchuan asked with a smile.
         "No, I'm fine."
         "That's good, that's good,"
         "Did you just come back?" Hao lianchuan asked.
          "Yes, I just came back."
         "That ..."
         Li Hao was helpless. He raised his hand and interrupted him."Hao bu, don't be so enthusiastic. I can't stand it. We've known each other for a long time. The first three suns I've seen was you, Hao bu ..."
         "Nonsense, it's Broken Sky!"
         “……”
         Li Hao coughed, speechless. He laughed, thinking that there was nothing wrong with what Hao lianchuan said.
         Not in the mood to argue with Hao lianchuan, Li Hao explained,""I'm here to explain why I didn't call Hao bu along ..."
         "I understand!"
         Hao lianchuan smiled understandingly."I'm a superhuman, so I'm easily exposed. Besides, you're just going out to take a look. You didn't expect to fight with Pirates on your first time out at sea, right?"
         “……”
         You've already said what I wanted to say, so what else can I say?
         Hao lianchuan didn't care. He laughed and said,""Li Hao, before the head left, he said that you'll be the night patrolman in the future. I thought about it, and it makes sense! I don't feel at ease being the Minister, even if I'm just acting. I'm too weak. "
         He still wanted to say something, but Li Hao interrupted him,""I understand! "Therefore, I came to find Hao bu with the same intention. It is easier to increase one's power. I thought that there are too few powerful people with superpowers among the night watchers, so I called Hao bu to the base of the Wei Wu Army. I will be cultivating these few days. Hao bu might be able to find the fifth Super Lock."
         "Really?"
         Hao lianchuan was overjoyed. Really?
         Li Hao nodded. The superpower lock was too weak to show, but it was not a big problem. If it was weak, he could just strengthen it.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Scion of the blood God could do it, and so could the five elements.
         Mysterious, no!
         It must be the power of the five elements. Of course, if there were many divine power stones, it might be possible. The energy of the divine power stones was much purer. However, it was obvious that Hao lianchuan did not have that many divine power stones.
         This time, Li Hao was going to improve his internal organs and physical body to ten thousand cubic meters.
         There was no need for the martial masters to absorb it now.  This was because they had all been strengthened to their current limits. Unless they could comprehend force, the effect would not be too great.
         This time, Li Hao's main goal was to strengthen a few supers.
         It was easy to raise one's superpower. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many powerhouses appearing in just 20 years. This was when they stopped to explore and look for the next stage. Otherwise, if they followed the same steps, those guys in the central continent would reach the rising light in just a few years.
         Hao lianchuan was overjoyed. There was hope!
         He had almost given up hope when he failed to find the fifth SuperLock. Now that there was hope, he immediately became enthusiastic."Li Hao, hou bu has left. He has an office on the sixth floor. I'm usually too lazy to go there, so I'll give it to you. You can work there from now on ..."
         “……”
         Li Hao was speechless."No, I don't want to!"
         "You, that's an entire floor. Don't look at how small the outside of the office is. In fact, there's a whole other world inside. Hou bu lives there, and there's a big balcony above. It's a big place ..."
         "Hao bu, do you think that hou bu won't be coming back?" Li Hao looked at him for a while.
         “……”
         Hao lianchuan instantly fell silent and awkwardly laughed,""How could I!"
         "Then why are you still giving me some?"
         Li Hao rolled his eyes. Hou Xiaochen came back to take a look. 'Good Lord, the house I've been living in for decades is gone. It'd be strange if I didn't beat you to death!'
         "Hahaha ... That ... We'll talk about it later!"
         Hao lianchuan laughed drily, but in his heart, he thought,"old hou has already run away, so why should I care so much?"
         Who asked old hou to be so insincere when he left?
         "It's settled then. I'll go back first. When Hao bu is done with his work, he can come to the base to find me. I'll probably be cultivating for the next three days. If Hao bu can form the fifth Super Lock in these three days, that would be the best result. "
         Hao lianchuan quickly nodded. He was looking forward to it and was eager to try.
         The fifth SuperLock!
         If he didn't see it, it meant that he had no hope of entering the rising light. Only if he saw it would it mean that there was hope for the rising light.
          At this moment, he wished he could leave with Li Hao.
         However, he still had to make some arrangements after leaving for a few days. He could only say reluctantly,""Alright, you can go back first. I'll come over as soon as I'm done."
         Hao lianchuan was too enthusiastic. He insisted on sending Li Hao downstairs. Li Hao had no choice but to walk out of the gate under the respectful gazes of many Nightwatchers. Then, Hao lianchuan simply asked his driver to drive Li Hao away. He also told the driver ... That Li Hao was here, so he would be the one serving Li Hao from now on.
         Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Why didn't he realize that Hao lianchuan was so good at flattering people?
         He didn't even want his face anymore.
         This guy was carved out of the same mold as Wang Ming. Could they be separated father and son?
         ……
         After returning to the base, Li Hao made some arrangements. In fact, he didn't care about anything. He just gave a few enlightenment ancient weapons to Liu Long and asked him to distribute them according to his military merits.
         At this moment, they were still using the Wei Wu Army's methods.
         But at this moment, Li Hao was actually preparing to use the heaven battling Army's method. With the black Vatican around, it was actually very easy to calculate military credits. However, at this moment, perhaps because the black Vatican had left heaven battling city, the military credits system seemed to have been blocked.
        
         Li Hao checked with silver armor. As a Regiment commander, if he lost contact with heaven battling city, he could actually set up a system of military merits similar to heaven battling city 's, as long as he made some changes.
         Because Li Hao wasn't around most of the time during the battle, these martial masters didn't know who had contributed more or less. Now, they were eating from the big pot and distributing the food equally.
         It was fine if there were few people, but it was not possible if there were too many people.
         Did the demon hunt squads need to expand?
         In the past, Li Hao didn't think it was necessary, but now, after seeing the heaven battling Army and sensing that there were many Pirates, he had some ideas. However, he didn't want to expand for the time being, as it was too troublesome to train them!
         It was good to have ready-made ones.
         If the Wei Wu Army hadn't left, Li Hao would have wanted to poach some people, but they had already left, so it was too late.
         With these thoughts in mind, Li Hao went into seclusion again on the night of October 6th.
         This time, his goal was to have all his five internal organs enter the ten thousand cubic meters level.
         Outside of him, a few supers were also waiting nervously and excitedly. Among them, Hao lianchuan was the most excited. He actually vaguely knew some things, such as the Li family's sword.
          But before this, Li Hao had refused to admit that what he had given was fake, so he couldn't say anything.
         Now that Li Hao had called him over, he knew that the real Li family sword was probably the one Li Hao had.
         On this day, Li Hao carried his sword with him the entire time. No one knew if he was showing off, or if he felt there was no need to hide it, or if he was just fishing.
         ……
         The Wei Wu army base once again became quiet.
         The martial masters were all trying to comprehend the ancient weapons or their own force.
         A small number of superpowers surrounded Li Hao and absorbed the energy that he exuded. They could absorb the five elements, non-elemental elements, and sometimes even some sword energy.
         At the side, the Black Panther was still lying lazily on the ground, opening its mouth from time to time and eating until its mouth was full of oil.
         It was very comfortable here and didn't want to leave at all.
         Although the ancient city could make it powerful, it was too miserable there.
         Black Panther didn't want to recall his miserable life in the ancient city. He only knew that he had almost starved to death. That big turtle seemed to have even taken his blood in the name of stimulating his bloodline. However, Black Panther didn't want to do it again.
         He almost died from the pain.
         The life it was living now was what it was pursuing. It ate and drank to its heart's content, helped kill people when it had nothing to do, and trained its claws. It was living a very comfortable life.
         ……
         As Li Hao fell silent again, time slowly passed.
         Central region.
         Yuan Shuo had completely disappeared.
         However, the central region did not calm down.
         As hou Xiaochen led his Wei Wu Army into the central region, it felt like a storm was about to come.
         On the Central Plains.
          A train was moving at high speed.  The Wei Wu Army no longer drove. Instead, they took up an entire train and escorted hou Xiaochen to his new post.
         At this moment, Chief Steward Yu and the others frowned and looked up through the iron sheet.
         Someone was in the sky!
         The kind that was absolutely unrestrained!
         Hou Xiaochen, on the other hand, was incredibly calm. He looked out the window and ate his breakfast, not paying any attention to the people outside.
         He knew who those people were.
         There were a few times when chief Yu wanted to get angry, but when he saw that hou Xiaochen was not saying anything, he suppressed his anger and did not make a move.
         In the sky, three people were floating.
         Two men and one woman.
         They were all very young!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com One of them, carrying a long saber on his back, looked down with a smile on his face.""Old hou is very low-key. We flew for half a day and he ignored us. To be honest, I'm quite curious about how strong he is and whether he can beat old Huang."
         The other young man was holding a long spear. Fire energy overflowed from his body, and his long hair fluttered in the wind. His eyes were cold."Fine, I'll just ignore him. But I can feel the will of the Golden spear. I wonder how strong this spear expert who was once known as the number one spear wielder is. I really want to have a spar with him!"
         The petite and cute woman widened her round eyes and giggled.""Why don't ... Old gun, you go down and try?"
         The man with the gun glanced at her and ignored her.
         "You don't dare to?" the petite girl giggled.
         "Shut up!"
         The man with the gun shouted. Who are you trying to fool?
         In any case, these people were not weak.
         They were only here to watch the fun. If the other party didn't come out, they weren't interested in taking the initiative to find trouble.
          The man with the long blade on his back smiled brightly.""Big eyes, go down and try Yu Luosha. I heard that she's very powerful, the kind that's ranked high among the Silver Moon martial masters. Go down and kill her!"
         “……”
         The big eyes ignored him. I'm not falling for it.
         She glanced down and said regretfully,""Forget it, you two are cowards, I'm done! I'm just curious, will hou Xiaochen fight with old Huang? Old yellow is still very powerful. Can the three of us defeat him together?"
         "Almost!"
         The man with the long knife touched his chin,"there's hope!" Old Huang is in the transformation stage, and the three of us are in the late stage. Although we are separated by a peak ... Old Huang may not be able to fight against the three of us together!"
         The big-eyed man blinked his eyes and said,"why don't we try ambushing him?" Just say that hou Xiaochen ordered us to do this, and we've joined his side ..."
         “……”
         The two of them looked at her speechlessly. 'Is this what a human would say?'
         The big-eyed man chuckled and quickly added,""Forget it, forget it. They're too powerful. I've heard that five birds Demon King's disciple, Li Hao, displayed his godly might in Silver Moon and killed a late stage rising light expert with a single strike ... It's said that he's extremely powerful. Why don't we go and play with him?"
        
         "I'm not interested. Silver Moon isn't a good place. I can't go there now!"
         The man with the long blade shook his head and quickly said,""There's no point in watching old hou and the others fight amongst themselves ... Why don't we find something exciting for them?"
         "Exciting?"
         The two of them looked at the man with the long saber on his back and were eager to give it a try.
         How?
         The man with the long blade laughed."I heard that out of Ying Hongyue's harem, only blue Moon is left in the central region. Let's find an opportunity to kill Blue Moon. Will Ying Hongyue go crazy and start a war with the night patrollers?"
         “……”
         The two of them looked at him, dumbfounded.
         "Why are you looking at me like that?" the man with the long knife said unhappily. What was there to be afraid of? Fei Tian is too mysterious. I know a thing or two about the red moon ... After killing Qing Yue, we can follow Li Hao's example and hang her at the entrance of the night patrolmen's headquarters. Ying Hong Yue would be letting herself down if she doesn't go crazy ... That'll be more interesting. Let's watch the Red moon battle the night patrolmen ... We might even be able to annihilate the red moon!"
         The two of them took a deep breath. This guy, he was really bold!
          This is crazy!
         The next moment, the big eye pondered for a while and nodded.""Let's go and find someone!"
         “……”
         The man with the long spear could not help but say,"don't be rash. We've offended too many people now. When the night patrolmen abandon us, we'll have nowhere to run ..."
         "What's there to be afraid of?"
         Once again, the knife-wielding man said indifferently,"if we're really abandoned by the night patrolmen, we'll go to someone else. If that doesn't work, we'll go to some local overlords. If that doesn't work, we'll set up our own sect and fight for the world. If that doesn't work, then ... Then we'll just run. If we can't beat them, can't we run?"
         “……”
         The man with the gun was a little helpless. These two ... Forget it, they were together.
         "Alright, but Blue Moon might not appear."
         "Isn't there still the orange moon?"
         "Orange moon seems to have gone north ..."
         "Then forget it. If it doesn't work, we can wait near the North Sea. Sooner or later, we'll come back and kill him with a knife or a spear. Then, we'll hang him in the Nightwalker headquarters ..."
         The three of them quarreled and soon left.
         Hou Xiaochen had been ignoring them the entire time. They wanted face too. If they ignored them, they would ignore them too. Let's go!
         ……
         In the carriage.
         After hou Xiaochen finished the last piece of dessert, he raised his head and chuckled as he shook his head,"Young people are so interesting!"
         "Hmph!" Yu Luosha snorted coldly."If it wasn't for the Minister's permission ... I'd have to teach them a lesson!"
         It had actually flown above their heads for half a day. This was a provocation.
         "There's no need to be angry. When you're in the central region, you should be more patient."
         Hou Xiaochen laughed,"what an interesting group of people. I've always wanted to find out if they're useless or geniuses since their power locks were broken ... But I still don't know."  "Is there no need to restrict his strength at all, or is his potential limited, and the future ends here?"
         "All of these are worthy of in-depth research. It's a pity that Silver moon's god tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were too arrogant in the early stages of their cultivation, and they were all killed in just a few years ... Yuan Shuo and the others are all wastrels!"
         He shook his head, feeling that it was a pity.
         Even if there were, they would be very weak. Some of them were only innate star light Masters, and yet they were still considered heavenly God Masters?
         The few people above him just now had at least three, or even four, broken naturally.
         The inborn sunlight and three suns.
         This was the true God tier master blessed by the heavens.
         Yu Luosha didn't say anything else, while Jin Jin said in a depressed tone,""I think they ... They seem to have some kind of power. Minister, this is ..."
         Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment and said,"he should've learned some ancient techniques, not Silvermoon's Martial Master Dao, not ancient martial arts, but ancient energy Dao." Don't look down on them, it's just that they have a different system from us. Ancient energy is still very strong. According to the ancient records, when the two sides fought, the path of energy almost overturned the entire ancient civilization!"
         "In the end, the ancient king rose up and suppressed the other party. This shows how strong the other party is. However, the supers today ..."
         He pondered for a while and shook his head."There are still many flaws. It's still different from the path of energy. The energy of the path of energy is actually born on its own. However, the energy of the supernatural can't be integrated into the body and be used completely. I've come to the central continent this time to see if the problem has been solved. "
         "If it's not dealt with, then the Dao of superpowers is nothing. If it's dealt with ... Then it means that the existence above the rising light has appeared!"
         This was because if he could use it, he would have a chance of breaking the next superpower lock.
         He came to the central continent with the intention of spying on the progress of his superpowers.
         He knew about martial masters.
         Superpowers were too rare for silver moons, and experts were also rare. Perhaps he could find results here.
         "Above the rising light?"
         Chief Yu thought for a while and said,"if it's above sunrise, then you'll need to break two of the five viscera super locks. There should be some, similar to the seal of a Martial Master. However, the Minister said that you'll need to break it completely and use the energy for your own use. Is it above sunrise with full combat power without any backlash?"
         "En!"
         Hou Xiaochen nodded,"also, there are special types of supers like wind, sky, and lightning. If they can break the four limb locks, they'll be called Sunglow. What if they break the five organs lock?" Therefore, I also want to see and experience a superpower that truly surpasses sunguang's full combat power. "
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As soon as he said that, gold spear and the other man frowned.
         If there were, it would be difficult to deal with.
         If hou Xiaochen and the others broke the seal, they would have the power to do so as well. However, that was only if they broke the seal. If they didn't break the seal, they would only have the power of a metamorphosis stage cultivator.
         If they could unleash their full power, they wouldn't have to worry about their organs being damaged. They would be more than happy to train their power ... At that time, even hou Xiaochen would be in trouble.
         Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything else as he thought back to those people.
         These people were the true geniuses of the central continent.
         I wonder if there are any more geniuses in the path of martial masters in the central continent.
         This time, he would be able to witness it.
         They were about to reach Sky Star City.
         [PS: I've updated more than 800000 words this month. Poor old Eagle, please give me some monthly votes!]
        
         Wei Wu army base.
         Three days passed in the blink of an eye.
         Li Hao said that he would train for three days, and he really meant it. Once the three days were up, he would stop training.
         As for Hao lianchuan and the others, who were not satisfied, Li Hao did not even look at them.
         After three days, Li Hao had consumed a lot of mysterious energy. He had consumed more than 30000 cubic meters, and it was still the same. Li Hao had absorbed about half of it, while Gou 'Zi had absorbed at least 5000 cubic meters of it.
         The rest was the total amount absorbed by Hao lianchuan and the others.
         This was also because Gou 'Zi wasn't that interested in the five elements. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to absorb so much.
         More than 100 divine power stones were consumed.
         However, it was nothing to Li Hao. After killing the two sunguang Pirates, the two pirates had more than 800 divine power stones in their storage rings. The Pirates were still rich.
         At this moment, Li Hao's number of divine power stones had increased instead of decreasing. Including the other gains, he had almost 3000 divine power stones in his possession.
          It was a little more than when they had just left the ruins.
         "Li Hao, don't stop!"
         Hao lianchuan's face was full of desire as he hurriedly said,""My superpower lock hasn't appeared yet, and my power hasn't increased ..."
         Li Hao glanced at him and said after a long while,""Is that so?"
         "Yeah! Just a little bit more ..."
         "Really?"
         "Of course!"
         Hao lianchuan almost patted his fat chest as a guarantee.
         Li Hao was tired."Advanced stage of the three yang realm. That's good enough. Without the appearance of the superpower lock, will you increase your realm?" Hao bu, next time you lie ... Be more serious. "
         Hao lianchuan was stunned.
         Looking at Li Hao, he was speechless and sorrowful.
         This guy's eyes were so sharp.
         I thought no one would notice!
         Li haocai couldn't be bothered with him and looked at the others. He had to admit that he was a little envious of superpowers at the moment. Wang Ming was at the peak of the radiant sun realm and was about to enter the three suns realm at any time.
         Hu Hao and yunyao had both entered the initial stage of the sunlit realm. Although they were only at the initial stage, their speed was still amazing.
         On the other hand, Li Meng ... Was really miserable. He was still hanging around in the dark Moon, but at least he had reached the full moon level. If he took another step forward, he would be in the sun glory.
         In fact, the few of them did not absorb much.
         Hao lianchuan had killed at least half of the ten thousand cubic meters of supers, and Wang Ming had killed another half before it was the three's turn. In the end, they had entered sunlit with ease.
         It was really difficult for a Martial Master to break through the 100-point threshold and enter the thousand-point threshold.
         Li Hao had also transferred a lot of five elements energy to her.
         According to the standards of these people, at least half of the 49 martial masters should have entered the glorious sun, which was also the level of a thousand-man warrior. However, in fact, there was not a single one.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The momentum blocked everyone's steps.
          Li Hao glanced at Li Meng. He had thought that she would be dejected ... But it turned out that he had been overthinking it. She wasn't dejected at all. She was very happy right now. If she was pretending ... It didn't look like it. She really did seem quite happy.  Even though everyone else had improved and she had improved the least, Li Meng was still very excited.""It's Almost Sunrise, so fierce!"
         “……”
         The group of people looked at her strangely.
         We ... Who doesn't have a sunlight?
         You're fierce, my ass!
         Seeing everyone looking at him, Li Meng had a smug look on his face. He wanted to say something, but after thinking about it, he suddenly shut his mouth.
         Li Hao was rather curious. From the looks of it, did he gain something?
         His eyes had mutated?
         Or something else?
         Of course, Li Hao didn't ask. This woman couldn't keep any secrets, and her mouth was even bigger than Wang Ming 's. It was just that she knew very little, so it wasn't obvious. If she knew more, she would be able to talk more than Wang Ming.
         If he shut up now, it would probably take a few days for everyone to know.
         Li Hao didn't say anything more and walked out.
         At this moment, his strength had increased, but it was mainly in his physical body. As for his aura, there was not much change. His physical body had strengthened a lot, and his five internal organs were stronger than before.
         It could only be said that his vitality was stronger, and it would be difficult for the other party to kill him.
         However, the increase in attack power and physical strength wasn't that great.
         Li Hao felt that hai Sha was probably stronger than before. He wouldn't be at a disadvantage until the end. They might be evenly matched.
         ……
         Li Hao walked out of the training area.
         At this moment, some martial masters outside had begun to become active. Clearly, they had absorbed and digested some things in the past three days. Li Hao glanced at them and couldn't see the details, but he could feel that some of their force seemed to be rising.
         This meant that someone had reached the perfected stage in three days.
         In the distance, seeing Li Hao and the others walk out, Liu Long quickly walked over. He hadn't cultivated much these few days. His main purpose was to help everyone share some of his experiences and distribute the opportunity to comprehend the Dao and ancient weapon to them.
          Li Hao didn't care about this. Liu Long could only care about it.
         In the past, he only needed to manage the demon hunting squad. Now, there were more people, but he could manage them as a law enforcement Captain for many years.
         "Guild leader!"
         Liu Long seemed to heave a sigh of relief."There are still a few people who are trying to comprehend the Enlightenment ancient weapon. Almost everyone else has a chance to do so ... But many of the Enlightenment ancient weapons are broken. Now, only that sword is left ..."
         Li Hao looked in one direction. There, someone seemed to have vaguely comprehended force.
         "Who's trying to comprehend it now?"
         "Hong Hao!"
         "Him?"
         Li Hao was surprised."He's already fast. Why did he choose to learn ancient weapons?"
         It seemed that Hong Hao was about to succeed. According to Li Hao's understanding, Hong Hao was Hong Yitang's third disciple, so he shouldn't have snatched the opportunity from others. Instead, he should have given it to others.
