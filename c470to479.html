moment, he didn't care anymore. He was somewhat angry and depressed as he said,""I didn't do it ... If I really did it, I would only kill him and not give him a chance to escape! Someone is trying to expose me ..."
 Then, his eyes flickered and he said in a low voice,""In the city ... There's another three suns! I met the other party face to face. Perhaps it was done by that person ..."
 Not far away, Hong Yitang's expression changed slightly. He quickly said,""That ... Everyone, don't misunderstand. This person must be slandering you! To be honest, that ... That's my wife. She just advanced to the three suns realm and is still stabilizing her realm. She's not dark-type, but wood-type, so how could she attack Li Hao?"
 "Li Hao's master, Yuan Shuo, and I were martial masters of the same generation. How could we bully the weak ... Don't speak without thinking and slander us! My wife is only there to protect the disciples of swords gate, she has no other intentions ..."
 This time, the two three suns were exposed!
 Moreover, they were the ones who exposed each other.
 And the reason was that Li Hao had been attacked.
 Li Hao also said in a hurry,"it's impossible for senior uncle Hong to deal with me. He was the one who gave me the earth overturning sword. It can't be senior uncle Hong!"
 He then added hurriedly,"it's not flying ... It's all a misunderstanding!" General Hu, Minister Hao, I'm fine. I'll be fine after a few days of rest. If I'm really fine, then let's just end this matter here!"
 Hao lianchuan glanced at him, but Hu dingfang was still very angry.
  The others, on the other hand, felt that sometimes, Li Hao was really ... Inexplicable ... Simple or stupid?
 Of course, it might be a good thing to not make enemies for the night patrolmen.
 This guy was quite interesting. He was also an old-fashioned man who had a strong sense of the big picture!
 There were many people like Li Hao among the night patrollers. Sometimes, they followed the rules too much and were unwilling to pursue certain matters in case it spoiled the overall situation.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was in line with the style of some night patrols.
 He didn't even want to pursue the matter, so what else could he say?
 The crowd glanced at Hong Yitang, he was in a hurry to admit his mistake just now because he was afraid that swords gate would be the one to blame for this.
 At this moment, a burst of sword essence also shot up into the sky!
 This was a method to inform his lover.
 At this moment, Hu dingfang frowned slightly and said,""Your lover ... Wasn't he ..."
 Hong Yitang coughed drily. Beside him, Hong Qing suddenly said,""That's my Senior Sister, but ... She fell in love with my father after a long time ... My father remarried!"
 “……”
 The surroundings were silent.
  Hong Yitang was so embarrassed that he wanted to burrow into the ground.  He had never told anyone about this. It was hard to say. He didn't care about the superpower realm, but Wulin ... He remarried his first disciple ... He would probably be laughed at by some old martial masters!
 This was against the rules of the martial arts world!
 Of course, he was no longer a Martial Master, so it was fine. However, he would still be condemned and despised by countless old martial masters.
 Hong Yitang was extremely embarrassed. He coughed and said,""That ... I ... Everyone, this ... This matter, I hope you can keep it a secret ..."
 Hao lianchuan and the others laughed, while Ziyue and the others mocked him.
 However, two yang and three yang in one gate ... To be honest, it was really not weak!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com No one said anything about the mockery.
 At this moment, everyone felt a little relieved. They had to admit that Li Hao was a Lucky Star to have found two three suns!
 Otherwise, no one would have expected that the swords gate would have a second three suns expert, and this Hong Yitang was not honest either!
 In the distance, Li Hao was a little embarrassed. He smiled apologetically at Hong Yitang.
 Hong Yitang smiled in return ... But he felt bitter in his heart.
 Could Li Hao be blamed?
  It can 't!
 Li Hao wasn't the one who exposed them, it was all Fei Tian's fault. Damn it, in order to drag his lover down with him, he tried to slander swords gate, damn it!
 There was a 99% chance that he was the one who attacked Li Hao.
 It was a pity that Li Hao didn't want to cause trouble. Otherwise ... He would have joined forces with Hu dingfang and the others to get rid of the FEI Tian people first!
 What a F * cking bastard!
 The more Hong Yitang thought about it, the angrier he got. This wasn't just a matter of being exposed. His true colors had been exposed, and the danger would increase!
 Next to Li Hao, Hao lianchuan patted him on the shoulder. At this moment, Hao lianchuan was extremely suspicious.
 This injury ... Don't tell me you didn't do it yourself?
 Good boy, with just a few words, two three suns have appeared ... If you say a few more words, will Zhang Ting be exposed?
 That was really good!

 Near the inner city gate.
 Two three-sun strong men suddenly appeared.
 Not long after, Hong Yitang's second wife also arrived.
 Hong Yitang transmitted a few words to the woman. The woman, who did not look very beautiful, pondered for a moment and said,""The swords gate will never hurt Li Hao. We can 't, and we won't dare to. Grandmaster Yuan is the leader of the martial arts ... The swords gate doesn't have the courage to hurt Grandmaster Yuan's last disciple!"
 Hong Yitang also nodded hurriedly.
 He couldn't take the blame for this.
 Others might not know, but he knew Yuan Shuo all too well. He, Hong Yitang, had killed his student, and Yuan Shuo would really kill him. No matter what method he used, he understood Yuan Shuo, and Yuan Shuo also knew the old men of Silver Moon martial arts world very well.
 ,m At that time, it would be more troublesome than offending the three major organizations.  No one said anything. Li Hao coughed and said,""I believe swords gate won't do that ... Don't worry, senior uncle Hong, I, Li Hao, will not accuse anyone for no reason!"
 As he spoke, he coughed again, and there was some blood oozing out. His five internal organs seemed to be severely damaged.
  The coughing didn't sound fake.
 In fact, it was not fake.
 Everyone present was an expert. They could see through Li Hao's pretense at a glance. With Li Hao's current appearance, no one would believe him if he said he was pretending.
 Li Hao exhaled and said,"this matter is over!" "Besides, it was my fault for not being skilled enough. Perhaps the other party isn't a three yang ... Not at the three yang level. Even if I was killed, it would be normal. There's no need for a martial arts practitioner to keep chasing after such things!"
 After saying that, he looked at Ziyue ... And hesitated for a moment before saying,""Leader of the purple Moon ... Can you give me a Blood God's spawn? My injuries aren't light, and if there's another battle, I'm afraid I'll die Here. "
 “……”
 Silence.
 Ziyue's face was cold.
 Blood God?
 That was the shadow God!
 Li Hao, are you crazy?
 Hong Yue and he were enemies, but he actually asked her for the shadow God's treatment.
 "Right now, my injuries are not light," Li Hao said sincerely."My internal organs are damaged, and ordinary mysterious energy is of no use. Unless it's some legendary treasure ... The best treatment for martial masters is the blood God. There's no need to say anything more about this. I only need one ... Leader Purple Moon, I don't think the red moon would want to see me die. "
 Zi Yue's face was cold as she said,"Li Hao, are you looking for death?" Or do you think that it's really amazing that you're dead?"
 Hearing this, Li Hao sighed and did not say anything.
 "Ziyue," Hao lianchuan said, frowning."If you have one, what's wrong with giving one?"
  Hu dingfang strode toward her and said coldly,""If there isn't ... I'll go into the city and kill a few Crimson Moon supers. Then, I might have one!"  "You can try!" Zi Yue said coldly. Why would I care if you kill all of Hong Yue's people?"
 "Then let's try!"
 Hu dingfang punched out directly, and the roar of a Dragon and a Tiger came out. It was extremely powerful.
 'Zi Yue's injuries aren't light at the moment, and I only want you to give me a Blood God's pill. If you don't give it to me ... It's no different from taking my life. If you don't give it to me, then I'll fight you!'
 The purple Moon also exploded with lightning. With a loud boom, the lightning was actually destroyed by Hu dingfang's fist. However, his arm was not injured at all, and he continued to punch!
 It was like the roar of a Tiger!
 The people around them felt their scalps go numb. This guy, they had to admit that Hu dingfang, who had learned the five animal technique and was also a super, was really strong. He could even be compared to sun Yifei.
 They were all martial masters in the late stage of three yang realm. The five birds breathing technique was particularly proficient. Hu dingfang was also a metal-Elemental Expert and had extremely strong offensive abilities. His punch was comparable to a full-force attack of a late stage three yang realm expert.
 Zi Yue was injured, and the Thunder God's venomous shell was also injured. They didn't have any advantage at all, and instead, they were constantly suppressed.
 Even in the central continent, sun Yifei had killed a peak three-Sun Warrior. He was a super, not a Martial Master, but an extremely powerful one.
 Now that Hu dingfang could compare to him, it was no wonder that he had been so arrogant before.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 A series of loud sounds rang out. Zi Yue kept retreating as the power of lightning exploded.
 At this moment, the reincarnation King, who had been silent all this while, waited for them to fight for a while before he interrupted,""You two ... Is there a need for internal strife? The inner city gates haven't opened yet, and there are countless treasures in the city. Is it worth it?"
 Then, he said,"Ziyue, there should be martial masters of the red moon in the city who died in battle. You must have retrieved some of those Shadow Gods as well ... Li Hao's injuries aren't light. Why don't you give him a Blood God? it doesn't need to be too strong. Either Dark Moon or sunlight will do. The red moon doesn't lack a shadow God, right?"
  Hu dingfang stopped fighting.
 In fact, he did not want to fight to the end with the purple Moon, because the king of Samsara would not sit by and watch. Yama and red Moon only had one three suns each. Even if they did not join forces, they had reached some tacit understanding.
 Cooperation!
 Two night patrollers, two flying Apsaras, two swords gate ... They would be stupid not to cooperate with him.
 Even though they were very strong, it was still difficult for two fists to fight against four hands, right?
 Ziyue's expression changed for a while, and she looked a little cold.
 A single Scion of the blood God wasn't that much.
 However, this anger ... Was really suffocating.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com She glanced at Li Hao. The previously honest Li Hao was now looking straight at her without any fear. When he saw Zi Yue looking at him, he smiled without any fear, which was a little different from before.
 There was no other reason. He was not afraid and did not need to pretend.

 He didn't need to be submissive when facing the red moon!
 His teacher had killed many Crimson Moon experts, and he was also a target of the Crimson Moon. Therefore, he was not as polite to Zi Yue as he was to the others, even Fei Tian and Yama. He had killed many people in secret, but he was still friendly on the surface.
 At the very least, they wouldn't feel that he was hostile to them.
 "Leader of the purple Moon, do you know how to make Blood God clones? If you don 't, I can teach you ..."
 Ziyue looked at him coldly and took back her words about this guy's simplicity. At least this guy was full of malice towards Hongyue!
 Of course, this was normal.
 However, he didn't expect that he, who had just broken through 100 points, would really dare to provoke him.
 After a moment of silence, she threw a red pill over. Hao lianchuan caught it and asked,""You Red Moon really know how to make Blood God clones. I thought you didn't notice the special characteristics before."
 Ziyue's face was cold and she didn't say anything.
 Li Hao took the red ball from Hao lianchuan's hand and sniffed it carefully. He was actually looking at it, but he pretended to be good. After sniffing it for a while, he sighed and said,""Dark Moon and full moon level ... I thought it was at the glorious sun level ... It seems like the purple Moon leader didn't only have one. He purposely picked the weakest one for me!"
  Zi Yue remained cold and did not speak.
 Li Hao chuckled and swallowed the pill. The others stared at him.
 Would the Scion of the blood God really be useful?
 Their organization might have already killed a group of Crimson Moon experts and even created a Blood God using the method that had been spread out. However, they had come in too quickly and had not received the news in time. They did not know what the effect was.
 It was only a Blood God's spawn at the Dark Moon level ... Would Li Hao be able to recover from such serious internal injuries after absorbing it?
 If it was possible ... Even if it could not increase their strength, just the healing effect alone was worth their attention.
 At this moment, Li Hao used the five birds breathing technique to digest the power of the blood God.
 Although the effect would be worse without sword energy, the blood God was originally prepared for martial masters. It was actually not bad that there was no sword energy to complement it.
 At this moment, Li Hao was still a warrior of thousands.
 The stronger the force, the faster the absorption and digestion.
 In the blink of an eye, more than half of the red energy was devoured by him. His internal organs instantly received some feedback from the red shadow energy.
 Li Hao's body regained some color, as if his skin had been filled with water.
 His skinny appearance had also improved a lot.
 Inner strength began to form.
 A moment later, Li Hao opened his eyes and heaved a long sigh."It's a pity ... If it was from sunlight, I might have fully recovered. But thank you, leader Purple Moon!"
 Everyone's gazes were extremely strange.
  The effect ... Was really good!  Li Hao's injuries seemed to be very serious. Although he had not fully recovered, his internal organs were no longer shaken and bleeding after his inner strength appeared again. At least, it seemed that his Foundation was not damaged ...
 This ... This is Yue Ming 's. What about RI Yao' s?
 What if it was a three yang one?
 At this time, the flying Ding Chen suddenly said,""Li Hao, I'm afraid that what happened before was really a misunderstanding! I've asked Kong Qi, and he didn't do anything to you. "
 "Of course, there are some misunderstandings ... It may take more time to resolve."
 After saying that, he threw over a ring-like item.""This is the new storage ring in the middle. It's small but it can store a lot of mysterious energy. It can store 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy and is divided into five slots. There's also 100 cubic meters of fire energy. If you need fire energy, I'll give it to you as well!"
 Li Hao was a little surprised, really surprised!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Fei Tian ... Gave me this thing?
 This was good stuff!
 It was the size of a ring, and the energy storage box was very large. It was very troublesome to pick it up, and the amount of energy stored in the energy storage box was not too much. It was at most a few hundred cubic meters.
 This, it's so small, but it can store 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy?
 Hao lianchuan also looked at dingchen with a strange expression. This guy ... Why did he spend so much money?
 "I have a small question. Does the blood God have an effect on all martial masters, or ... Only the martial masters of your five birds sect have an effect?"
 Trying to build a relationship and giving gifts. This guy seemed to be only looking for an answer.
 Li Hao frowned slightly. After thinking for a while, he said,""It's effective for all martial masters ... However, the breathing technique of five birds has the best absorption effect. The other martial masters 'breathing techniques may not be as effective. If our five birds sect's conversion efficiency is 90%, the others will at most be 70%... But it's all very effective!"
  He answered honestly.
 This was because he would know if he tried it with other martial masters.
 The breathing technique of five birds was powerful, and it wasn't that no one knew about it, so it wasn't worth hiding it. If he told too many lies, no one would believe him.
 70%!
 Everyone's eyes flickered. He was also very powerful.
 As for Ziyue, her eyes became even more gloomy and cold as she glanced at Ding Chen who was flying in the sky. "What do you mean by asking these questions at this moment?"
 Dingchen acted as if he didn't see it and said,"is it useful against superpowers?" If a superpower absorbs the blood God ... Will they be able to strengthen their body?"
 Li Hao frowned."It's hard to say. Under normal circumstances, it won't be of much use. Even the breathing technique of five birds doesn't seem to be very effective ... But ... It's not completely useless."
 "Nonsense!"
 At this moment, Zi Yue shouted angrily,"Li Hao, how dare you spout nonsense!" It's true that the blood God's clones are useful to martial masters, but they're completely useless to superpowers. They can even absorb the mysterious energy of superpowers!"

 This matter must not become a fact, not even a rumor.
 If that happened, she didn't dare to imagine the consequences.
 Now, everyone was just curious. Some martial masters and organizations that trained martial masters were tempted, but once it was said that it was also useful for superpowers ... Red moon's trouble was not as big as it was now!
 That was a disaster!
 Don't think that the three major organizations are invincible. When everyone in the world has their eyes on you and treats you as their nourishment, you can imagine how serious the consequences will be!
 Nowadays, there were already a lot of fights between supers because mysterious abilities could be improved.
 If the effect of the red shadow was stronger ... Then what was the point of killing supers?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Of course, it was to kill the red shadow!
 This thing could be artificially cultivated. Some people even wanted to break into the red moon headquarters and seize the cultivation method.
 Li Hao frowned, looked at her, and said in a deep voice,""I'm not talking nonsense, I'm just talking about some of my discoveries ... What are you so anxious about? We'll know if it's true or not after we try. "
  "The power of the blood God does conflict with the mysterious energy," he continued."Under normal circumstances, there aren't many benefits to absorbing it. It'll even make the body feel uncomfortable."
 "However, my teacher found out that the blood God's clones can strengthen the superpower lock ... Strengthen it! I don't know if there's such a discovery and feeling in the superpower realm. The superpower lock is powerful, and once it's broken, the potential released is even greater ... So, strengthening the superpower lock is a good thing, of course, for geniuses!"
 "A genius's superpower lock can be easily broken if it's too weak. It's easy to level up, but if your Foundation is too weak, the blood God will come in handy. It can be absorbed by the superpower lock to strengthen it and increase the difficulty of leveling up ... It's the same concept as a Martial Master strengthening the superpower lock ... But you don't need to practice martial arts. It's the same principle as how you train martial masters to level up!"
 "However, the key is that it can save a lot of time. It will take at least a few years to train a ten-chop Martial Master ... And this can be easily solved with a Blood God!"
 BOOM!
 Some people's breathing was unstable, some people's eyes were changing, and some people's hearts were surging.
 Li Hao's words were nothing to ordinary supers.
 Do you think we're idiots?
 However, to the powerhouses from large organizations like them, they knew many things. For example, the strengthening of the Super Lock and the breaking of it would indeed release more potential.
 This was the reason why a Martial Master could become stronger after advancing in rank.
 Martial masters cultivated their inner strength, which also had the effect of a powerful Super Lock. It did not mean that martial masters would become stronger after advancing, but they would release more potential, which could help them break through to higher realms.
 Of course, it was troublesome and not worth it to train a Martial Master.
 It took too long!
 However ... If a Blood God's pill could solve the problem ... Didn't that mean that an ordinary person who took a Blood God's pill and broke the Super Lock could even surpass Starlight master and become a moon underworld master?
 If it was true ... That ... Was simply unbelievable!
 Ding Chen no longer asked. At this moment, he was quickly thinking.
  Could Li Hao's words be true?  It was actually very simple. He just had to find someone to try it out. His talent couldn't be bad. It was best to find someone who could easily break through but didn't have a deep foundation. He could give him a Blood God's spawn and see if this kind of person could become an expert with a deep foundation.
 At this moment, even the reincarnation King could not help but ask,""How can the blood God's clone be sent into the superpower lock? You said it would clash with the mysterious energy ..."
 Li Hao frowned and remained silent.
 The king of Samsara laughed."You've already said the core. Besides ... Everyone knows what you're thinking. Why don't you say more?"
 How could everyone not understand Li Hao's intentions?
 Didn't he say this so directly to make Hong Yue feel worse?
 Li Hao exhaled and ignored Zi Yue's murderous gaze. He continued,""It's actually not difficult. Those who can control the mysterious energy can suppress it and the power of the blood God can naturally be sent in. Those who can't control it will use up all the mysterious energy ... The mysterious energy of supers is not infinite. When there is no more mysterious energy in the body, there will naturally be no conflict!"
 Everyone came to a sudden realization. It wasn't that they didn't expect it, but that it was so simple!
 Most importantly, at their level, it was already very difficult for them to run out of mysterious energy again.
 When he heard that it was so simple ... There was no doubt.
 "Then the accumulation of spirit ..." The reincarnation King continued.
 "Do you think I'm an idiot?" Li Hao said angrily. Besides, that's something that only my teacher can do, how would I know?"
 These guys are too much!
 I've already said so much, yet you're still asking. You're even asking about the accumulation of spirit.
 The reincarnation King was not angry at all this time. Instead, he laughed.
  It's fine even if you don't say it.
 At the very least, he had gotten quite a bit of important information.
 The Scion of the blood God could strengthen the superpower lock and allow the foundation of the supers to become deeper. To be honest, at the level of the three suns, they understood more things. Sometimes, the superpower lock really could not be broken easily.
 People would die!
 Some peak three yang realm and even sunrise realm experts hoped that the superpower lock would not be broken again. Breaking it ... Often meant that there was not enough time and people would die.
 The Scion of the blood God ... Hong Yue!
 At this moment, Zi Yue also frowned. She looked at Li Hao and stopped scolding him.
 Instead, he was thinking ... Could the Scion of the blood God really strengthen the superpower lock?
 She did not know!
 That's right, she didn't know if she could do it. The blood shadow was Ying Hongyue's exclusive skill. Everyone in Hongyue knew about the existence of the red shadow and knew that it was helpful to martial masters ... That was all.

 If he could strengthen the SuperLock ...
 She seemed to have thought of something, and her expression changed slightly.
 Therefore, was there such a problem with some three suns that could fight five or six people of the same level?
 When the leader was at the three yang realm, he was invincible.
 After stepping into the rising light, the rising light in the central region was almost invincible ... Could it be ... Because of these factors?
 Strengthening the Super Lock was a bad thing for many people.
 For geniuses and powerhouses, this was a great thing. Many people hoped that their Foundation could be deeper. Blindly breaking through would only cause their bodies to explode and die!
 At this moment, everyone fell into deep thought.
 Li Hao's information was worth thinking about.
 Before this, many people didn't know the use of the red shadow. Although many people had the red moon, no one dared to casually use it. It was exclusive to Ying Hongyue. Who dared to use it?
  In the past few years, only a few people had managed to obtain some, but they would not use them recklessly. They might not even dare to eat them.
 Only Li Hao and the others were bold enough to eat as much as they wanted.
 The scene gradually fell silent.
 Liu Long and Liu Yan were both wooden figures, so they didn't say a word. However, at this moment, they were both shocked and driven mad.
 This Li Hao ... He's getting better at lying!
 He had injured himself while cultivating, but not only did he capture two three suns, but he also obtained the blood God to heal his injuries, an energy storage ring, and 100 cubic meters of fire energy. He had also caused Red Moon to fall into an even more troublesome situation.
 Was this the horror of a scholar?
 In just a few words, he had casually created countless contradictions!
 One had to know that many of these people in front of him were his enemies.
 But at this moment, even Ziyue did not say anything.
 Hao lianchuan patted Li Hao's shoulder again and said regretfully,""Don't talk nonsense. If you share this information with the night patrolmen, we'll consider it a great contribution. How can you talk nonsense!"
 What a pity!
 Although he felt that the effect would be good if he told them.
 However, if he handed it over to the Minister, the Minister might be able to make a bigger commotion.
 Little fellow, you still lack channels ... This news is not explosive enough!
 If word really did spread, some of the major powers in the central region would demand clones of the blood God. If they didn't use them themselves, they would give them to their children. Who would want their children to be ordinary people?
 How tiring it was to practice martial arts!
 One blood deity could save a few years and deepen their Foundation. Wouldn't it be done if they just killed a few members of the red moon sect?
 Li Hao lowered his head."Minister, I'm a person. If I don't tell you ... If I tell you, I'll only tell you the truth!"
 “……”
 Alright, just pretend I didn't say anything.
 Hao lianchuan did not say anything else.
 He coughed lightly and said,"everyone ... Let's put an end to the matter of injuring Li Hao!" "Hu dingfang, don't cause trouble for Ziyue for no reason. She's probably going crazy right now. If you kill her, people might think that we've obtained a peak three-yang Blood God's clone ... They'll come to you for it, and you won't be able to refuse!"
 Hu dingfang glanced at him and did not say anything.
 Since Li Hao's injuries had mostly recovered, he naturally wouldn't find trouble with him.
 At this moment, Li Hao finally had the time to glance at the inner city gate.
 Sure enough!  He saw a huge turtle. It wasn't that big, but it was just looming above the city.
 A living turtle!
 He then looked at the two large characters above the city ... They were ancient characters that he could recognize.
 "Zhan Tian!"
 The two big words were floating above the city gate. Just looking at these two big words ... Made him feel his blood surging and his heart surging.
 "The Wang family is raising a big turtle ..."
 He thought back to the song, and from what he could tell, the Wang clan didn't seem very powerful, nor did it seem to be capable of any offensive power.
 However, when he saw the two words 'Zhan Tian', a surge of courage suddenly rushed into his mind.
 These two words did not match the Wang clan's folk song.
 Zhan Tian ... What a bold move, what a big tone!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Heaven battling city?
 Li Hao looked at the two words and had the urge to roar.
 At this moment, Hu dingfang suddenly said,""You recognize those two words?"
 He didn't know her.
 In fact, not many people present knew who he was. Hao lianchuan only knew who he was after their previous exploration. After all, no one was weak to be able to reach this place. Some members of the exploration Department could not reach this place.
 "Zhan Tian!" Li Hao nodded and took a deep breath.
 Zhan Tian?
 Everyone chewed for a while and frowned slightly. What a big tone, what courage.
 Heaven battling city!
 Was he going to fight the heavens?
 Li Hao stared at the two words again. Who had written them?
 He wasn't sure!
 However, he knew that the person who had written the two words must have been a great hero. When the two words were written, Li Hao even vaguely felt that the person really dared to fight the heavens!
 Crazy, strong!
 This was the Wang clan's city?
 He did not know, but it was very possible.
  The Wang family's ranking among the eight great families wasn't too high, right?
 Li Hao was slightly confused. If the Wang family had such a powerful city ... What about my Li family?
 He didn't have to leave only a sword, right?
 All kinds of doubts were hidden in his heart.
 He carefully examined the city gate again. It was very, very tall, at least a hundred meters tall. It couldn't fly yet. This gate ... Was probably difficult to open.
 Above the city, there seemed to be a city gate tower. It was partly visible and partly hidden in the darkness, making it impossible to see much.
 However, he could vaguely see the White figure.
 The silver chiliarch was up there?
 If the other party didn't come down ... Wouldn't this inner city gate be unable to be opened?
 "Li Hao, you're Yuan Shuo's student," Zi Yue said indifferently."He's explored countless ruins in his life and has a deep understanding of these things. What can you see?"

 Li Hao didn't say anything. He just approached the city gate and looked up.
 The two words at the top still made his heart surge with emotion.
 Zhan Tian!
 After looking at it for a while, his gaze fell on the door. He touched it gently and felt the cool metallic texture.
 He gave it a light push ... But it didn't move at all.
 It was extremely sturdy!
 The entire city gate seemed to be one piece, but upon closer inspection, one could see a weak crack and a small crack in the air, which might be the place where the key opened.
 This door could only be opened from the back or through this gap.
 However, in the middle, it was still 50 meters tall.
 Would he be attacked if he flew up?
  This seemed to be a dead end!
 Of course, if the three suns worked together and blocked it with their origin divine weapons, they might be able to stay in the air for a while.
 Li Hao observed the surroundings and walked toward the nearby city walls, which were all very tall.
 He touched it and felt it. The material was similar to the ground.
 It felt like the city walls were truly one!
 If they wanted to break through the city wall ... They might as well try the city gate.
 Li Hao turned his head and shook his head."I'm just a newbie, so I can't see much. Three sun experts, why don't you try to fly up and use powerful weapons to defend against attacks from the sky? if you fly over the city wall, you might be able to open the city gate from the back. It won't be too troublesome."
 Everyone was speechless.
 They had considered this plan before.
 But ... Who would be willing to?
 After flying over the city walls, who knew what was behind the city gates, let alone the silver-tier powerhouses above?
 The attack in the air might even shatter their origin God weapons and severely injure them ... Who would be willing to pay such a huge price?
 It wasn't just them, but all of them had joined forces.
 After a moment of silence, Hao lianchuan said,"let's not talk about this for now. It's about time for everyone to gather. Most of the black armors should have been taken care of. The remaining ones should not cause any trouble!"
 It had been two to three hours since the battle started.
 It was almost time!
 The sounds of battle in the city had also weakened a lot. There were only a few sporadic battles. Obviously, either the weak ones had all died, or everyone was moving in groups, and there was no chance to attack.
 No one said anything, and Hao lianchuan didn't say much either. He shouted,""All the supers in the city, gather here!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A moment later, someone arrived.
 Some of them were injured, some even had broken limbs.
 One, two ...
 More and more people arrived.
 The crowd watched in silence as more and more people gathered.
 After about 20 minutes, no one else came.
 Li Hao glanced around and saw that there were about 100 people from each side.
 Now ... Including these three suns, there were at most 60 people.
  Nearly half of it was gone!  Apart from the three suns, the remaining superpowers were only around 50.
 There were still about 20 night patrols left. They had obviously been attacked and lost some, but it was still a lot.
 The Yama ... Three of them!
 That's right, other than the king of Samsara, there were three other Yama. They were all from the glorious sun, and at this moment, they seemed to be all alone.
 Red Moon, less than 10 people.
 Fei Tian, it had to be said that this organization was quite strong. Including the three suns in the city, there were still 13 people.
 And swords gate ... Only had around 10 people left.
 As for the Rogue cultivators ... They were nowhere to be seen!
 The few independent wandering cultivators had all disappeared.
 Li Hao watched silently. It was normal for the Yama to have few people. He had already killed a few of the remaining people.
 It was normal that there were few people in the Crimson Moon.
 Swords gate had the three suns, but why were there so few people?
 At this time, Hao lianchuan was actually a little surprised. There were fewer people than he had expected, and some of the night patrols had died.
 Could it be ...
 He glanced at the flying three suns and the swords gate ... These two three suns must have killed a lot of people, right?
 Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so easy for so many people to die in such a short time.
 Obviously, he wasn't the only one who thought this way. The others thought the same.
 This was because there were really many people who had survived from Feitian.
 15th place!
 That's right, including the two three suns, there were a total of 15 fairy supers alive, and how many of them were there?
 It seemed like there were only 22 of them!
 In other words, Fei Tian still had two-thirds of its members and 90% of its combat power.
 If it wasn't for the assassin Fei Tian, how could so many of them have died?
 Dingchen was also very surprised by the fairy's side. The other parties had suffered great losses, including the night patrollers. Previously, they had more than 30 people, but this time, the number had decreased by a lot. Only the fairy had 16 people when they entered the city, excluding the two of them. Three of them had died ... It was really not considered a lot!
 "Kong Qi, how many did you kill?"
  Ding Chen secretly transmitted his voice and complained.
 How did so many people die?
 Although Fei Tian had suffered the least losses, everyone had already made a judgment in their hearts. It was you, Fei Tian, who had assassinated too many people. Otherwise, how could you have lost so many people all of a sudden?
 The three suns, who were called Kong Qi, was also a little depressed. He transmitted,""I ... I didn't kill many. I killed three night watchers, a few swords gate supers, two Yama sunlit, and one Crimson Moon sunlit ... And then I came back!"
 He did kill a few, but no more than 10 people.
 But this time, there were probably 40 to 50 dead.
 It must be that woman from swords gate!
 Dingchen was helpless, but it was not little.
 With the swords gate's experts killing each other, and some of them being killed by hei Teng and the copper Spears ... It was not surprising that so many of them survived.
 If he hadn't called the two three suns back in advance, the remaining few people ... Would be awkward.

 ……
 The reincarnation King's expression was not as ugly as before.
 He was calm!
 He looked at the three remaining sunbrers beside him, he was not angry at all. He knew that people would die before he entered the palace, but ... Leaving three of them behind for the Yama, Fei Tian and swords gate had the guts to do so!
 Hao lianchuan didn't say anything and just said,""Each of you, tell us how many black Vatican you've dealt with so that we can have a count!"
 "The night patrollers captured 72 black puppets ..." Minister he quickly said,"in addition, a copper puppet was forced into a corner by us and finally self-destructed ..."
 72 corpses, that was quite a number.
 The other families also quickly reported.
 All in all, this time, the few guilds had taken care of more than 200 black daggers, and three copper daggers had died!
 As such, even if there were still hei Teng in the city, there would be less than a hundred of them.
  As for Tong Yan, there were only two of them left.
 This thousand-man team was completely destroyed.
 The entire outer city was no longer a threat.
 There were more than 60 people here, including the three suns.
 More than half of them were sunlit, and only a small half were Dark Moon. After all, they were too weak, and almost all of them had died.
 "What do we do now?"
 Hong Yitang looked at the tall city wall and frowned.""At this point ... If we don't enter the city to take a look, I won't be satisfied. But if that guy doesn't come down, do we really have to attack?"
 "The night patrolman has no other way?"
 Hao lianchuan laughed."I have a way!"
 Everyone's heart moved. There was a way?
 "Those who pass through the second passageway will have to restrain their aura. In fact ... They can fly!"
 “……”
 The surroundings were silent.
 At this moment, the reincarnation King's eyes flickered. He looked at the other party and said after a long while,""Good plan! You didn't say it before, and now you're telling me ... Fine, it seems like you've already made preparations, and you're using the person who's going to take the second passageway as a Pathfinder, right? It's no wonder you, the night patrol, are unwilling to take the second passage!"
 How could everyone not understand when he said this!
 Ziyue's expression was also extremely ugly as she looked at Hao lianchuan.
 "Ziyue and Swordmaster Hong can both fly," Hao lianchuan said seriously. "You can try if you don't believe me." The threat in the air had disappeared ... Really! This is actually a good thing. You have more freedom than us, and you can even directly cross the city wall ... Anyway, I don't have the courage to take the second passage, but since you have taken it ... You actually have the upper hand!"
 What he said made some sense, but ... When she thought of how this bastard didn't say that they could fly, and how everyone subconsciously didn't dare to try, she was still furious!
 "Hao lianchuan!"
 "Aren't you afraid ..."Zi Yue said coldly.
 Hao lianchuan laughed."Don't be angry. I'm only at the early-stage three yang realm. I really don't dare to rashly take the second passage. It's not that I didn't want to say it on purpose. I'm just afraid that you can fly and leave us behind. Now that the few of you can fly, you can fly over the city wall and take down that silver-tier powerhouse. We can besiege him together ... Open the city gate and enter together. This way, it will be safer!"
  The night patrolman knew a lot of things.  Actually, everyone had thought of the possibility of being able to fly ... But even the three suns did not dare to try it rashly. If it did not work, it would be courting death.
 Now that it was confirmed, Zi Yue and the others were furious.
 However, on second thought, it was indeed a great advantage.
 It would be much more convenient if he could fly.
 Hong Yitang was secretly complaining!
 F * ck!
 If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have taken the second passage.
 This damn Hao lianchuan was obviously hoping that he and Ziyue would be the bait to lure that guy down. This was too dangerous.
 He had thought that by taking the second passageway, he would be able to keep a low profile and be safer, but it turned out that ... It was even more of a trap!
 Hao lianchuan was not a good person either.
 Zi Yue was silent, her face unsightly.
 Her injuries were not light, and she was not willing to be a target.
 "You can take the second passage!"
 "It's not like we can't leave!"Ziyue said coldly.
 Hao lianchuan sighed."Yaocheng is dead. If I go, I'll be dead too. I might lose more than half of the other three suns ... If too many three suns die, how can we deal with that one?" Now, since the two of you have already passed by ... Why don't you put in more effort? at most, we'll split the loot and lure that guy down, kill him, and we'll enter the city to eat the meat!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com On the side, Li Hao could only say ... Admiration!
 No wonder he tricked those people into going through the second passage. It wasn't just to weaken their strength, but also to have this intention.
 What would be the consequences if Zi Yue and the others refused?
 There was no need to talk about the night patrolman, but would Fei Tian be satisfied?
 Would the king of Samsara be satisfied?
  I'm just using you as targets, not to kill you. Can't I go up and take a look?
 Even if they did not work together to destroy Ziyue and the others, there would probably be no more cooperation. When the night patrollers attacked Ziyue ... How would Ziyue resist?
 Zi Yue had obviously understood this.
 She took a deep breath and suddenly said,"let Li Hao try!" Li Hao, force out a few drops of your heart blood and try to drip them into the crack to see if they can open the city gate ..."
 Li Hao was dumbfounded. Why am I the one?
 "If you still can't open it after trying, Hong Yitang and I ... Can go up and take a look. Otherwise, don't even think about it!" Zi Yue said coldly.
 Anyway, she had to try before she was satisfied.
 Li Hao frowned."I'm from the Li family. Even if this is the Wang family's ancient city, we're not on the same side. Aren't you overthinking it?"
 "You can try it first!"
 "I haven't recovered from my injuries yet," Li Hao said unhappily."My internal injuries are not light ... If I force out the blood from my heart again, do you want me to die?"

 "I won 't!"
 Ziyue laughed,"don't you like the blood God?" Alright, I'll give it to you! If you still can't open the city gate after forcing out a few drops of heart blood, I'll compensate you with a Blood God at the early stage of the sun glory realm ... You'll naturally recover!"
 Damn it!
 Li Hao secretly cursed. He had had a good time talking during the first half of the game, but now, he had fallen into a trap.
 Was the blood of the heart useful?
 Who knows!
 It was fine if it was useless, but if it could really be activated ... Next, he would probably be stared at by these three suns!
 Li Hao also had a headache.
 Hao lianchuan cursed in his heart. He had forgotten about Li Hao.
 Hu dingfang was about to speak again when Li Hao suddenly said,""Alright, but ... I'll need a Blood God at the three yang level ... If you don't have any, then I'll have ten at the radiant sun level!"
  "Are you joking?"
 Li Hao said unhappily,"you entered the city for benefits. I paid with my heart's blood. Even if I entered the city, what benefits would I get?" Is it too much for me to ask for some benefits? Regardless of whether it works or not ... Give me the thing first, then I'll agree! Otherwise, I won't agree to it. It's up to you to open it or not, what does it have to do with me?"
 There was a high probability that the blood from his heart would be useless.
 Li Hao was clear!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If it was useful, the stone gate would have been opened by now.
 He had only lost a few drops of blood essence, but he had to make up for it. Otherwise, it would be a huge loss. A solar flare pill could definitely make up for it ...
 However, Li Hao was not happy if he did not earn money.
 Now that the sword energy was gone, he didn't care too much about the mysterious energy. It would be best if he could get some clones of the blood God.
 " 10 is too much," the Samsara King said,"let's make it three!" Li Hao, what do you think?"
 Then, he turned to Ziyue and said,"I won't let Hongyue pay for these three pills. Swords gate, Fei Tian, and Yan Luo will each pay one. Or, I will give you an item of equivalent value!" As for the Nightwalker, since Li Hao is willing to pay, then forget it!"
 Hong Yitang couldn't take it anymore. He was a little speechless."That ... I will also go up the city wall after Li Hao fails ..."
 What, do I have to pay?
 Even if one shining sun pill wasn't worth much and he could afford it, why should he?
 "Fine, so what if I, Yama, offer two items of equivalent value?" the Samsara King laughed.
 At this moment, what was the point of caring about such a small gain and loss?
 At this point, if Li Hao and purple Moon didn't want to do it ... Were the three suns really going to start a war?
 Li Hao also knew when to stop. He nodded and said,""Alright, I'll agree for the sake of the reincarnation King. But if it's the red moon ... Don't even think about it!"
 Ziyue glanced at him coldly. She hated this guy now.
 If it wasn't for the fact that she couldn't kill him, she would have slapped him to death!
 Li Hao added,"it's useless to have too much heart blood. In fact, I only have a few drops of heart blood ... Even if you force me to my death, it's useless. I'll condense three drops. If it doesn't have any effect ... Then don't say anything more. Why don't I dig out my heart and hang it on it for you to see?"
 No one said anything. Hu dingfang glanced at him and did some calculations. Three drops of heart blood ... Was not a big problem.
 With three sunshiny clones of Blood God, he could replenish his blood and strengthen his qi and blood.
 On the other side, Ziyue did not waste any more time and threw three blood pills at him.
 Li Hao actually suspected that these guys had some kind of storage ring. Did space-type supers have one?
 Otherwise, they didn't seem to have any place to store their things, so how could they have so many treasures?
 He took the three Blood God pellets and ate one. Then, he stepped forward and circulated his breathing technique. A moment later, he let out a soft cry and patted his chest. A drop of crystal-clear blood, like a Ruby, was patted out.
 Li Hao directly sprayed his blood on the door ... And it didn't move at all!
 Everyone was slightly disappointed. Although they had expected this, it now seemed that ... Li Hao, the successor of the eight great families, might really have no effect on the other families, unless they discovered the Li family's ruins.
 The first drop of blood was useless.
 Li Hao once again sent out a second drop of blood, which continued to splash on the door, but it still didn't move.
 Li Hao took a deep breath and turned his back to the crowd, but his eyes were slightly strange.
 He could feel that it was useless.
 However ... He also felt something special. The two words above the city gate seemed to ... Want to suck his blood. It had some attraction to his blood.
 Li Hao resisted the urge to let the two characters suck blood. He controlled his blood essence and only splashed it on the city gate.
 He was a little excited.
  These two words ... Could it be that they had some use?  "Zhan Tian ..."
 These two words sounded very powerful.
 Maybe ... Maybe he could try it later to see if it was effective.
 Of course, he could forget about it now.
 There were so many people here. If they saw that it was useful to the handwriting, they might tear Li Hao to pieces and feed him the words.
 The third drop of blood essence splashed on the door again.
 It was still useless!
 Li Hao's face was slightly pale, but he quickly recovered under the effects of the blood God. He exhaled and looked at Hao lianchuan."Minister ... Burned my blood ... In case red Moon uses it for something ..."
 In the distance, Ziyue really did have such thoughts.
 In the end, Hao lianchuan waved his hand and a fireball appeared, instantly burning all the blood on the door.
 At this time, the others had no other choice. It was useless.
 It seemed that he could only let the two three suns go up and lure the silver down.
 Li Hao panted and retreated.
 He looked a little unhappy ... But he was smiling in his heart.
 He earned again!
 Most importantly, those two big characters ... He vaguely felt that there seemed to be some connection at this moment. He raised his head and looked at the two big characters ... At this moment, he felt as if he was looking at the eight trigrams diagram in the Silver City.
 It wasn't an Eight Trigrams diagram ... He could only vaguely see a person writing these two large characters.
 "Zhan Tian!"
 He could vaguely see a blood-red longbow on the man's back and a saber at his waist. It was just a faint shadow ... But Li Hao's face paled in horror.
 He didn't have the domineering and murderous aura of the Li clan's ancestor!
 But ... Why did it feel ... So terrifying!
 It was faint and soundless. He looked gentle, but at this moment, Li Hao felt as if he had fallen into hell. He couldn't look straight at him!
 He lowered his head, and large drops of sweat dripped down.
 "Li Hao ..."
 "Boss ... I ... Lost too much blood in my heart ... My injuries are acting up again ... I feel terrible ..."
 Li Hao panted heavily, like a fish that was suffocating.
 Everyone's expression changed slightly. It was that serious?
 Li Hao's sweat didn't seem to be fake. How could it be? it was only three drops of heart blood ... Could it be that his old injuries had really reappeared?
 Li Hao, on the other hand, only saw a back view.
 He didn't make a move, he didn't draw his sword, he didn't do anything. It was as if he had just calmly written two words ... But at this moment, it was even more terrifying than when he had seen the sword.
 Who was this person?
 Wang family's ancestor?
 Why ... Did he look so much more terrifying than the Li clan's ancestor!
 Or could it be that he was too weak to see the difference and only felt fear subconsciously? or was it because the Li family's ancestors had taken care of him, so he didn't feel it clearly?
  Many doubts appeared once again.
 Li Hao's breathing was steady, and his sweat dripped to the ground. Only then did the voice in his ears gradually become clear.
 At this moment, he felt that he had once again survived a disaster.
 Some people, even if it was just their back view from countless years ago, could almost kill you. This was the true horror.
 "The Wang clan!"
 He mulled over all of this in his heart. Was the Wang clan's ancestor that terrifying?
 Of the eight great families ... His Li family couldn't possibly be the weakest, right?
 No way!
 At this moment, Li Hao couldn't help but doubt everything.
 [P.S. In the last few hours, it'll be a waste not to vote for the monthly votes. Let's get rid of Red Moon, who's in third place. Everyone, give it your all. Let's go, let's go!] In addition to the chapter at night, he had updated more than 10 words in the last three days. Old Eagle was still working hard!

 Li Hao lowered his head, his eyes bloodshot.
 However, looking at his back, it was as if he was looking at the universe.
 He carried a longbow on his back, carried a sword, and held a pen.
 He had nothing to do with the so-called Wang clan's turtle ... And yet, a person like him had appeared here, and countless years ago, had written down two words.
 The others didn't see anything, and neither did Li Hao.
 However, it wasn't until the splattering of blood triggered these two words that he saw the extremely terrifying scene.
 He panted heavily.
 Around them, the others looked a little strange. Hu dingfang was even more restless and regretful. Just now, he had thought that the three drops of blood essence were nothing. Li Hao had made a profit by exchanging them for three blood deities.
 However, at this moment, if his eyes could kill, Zi Yue would have been killed on the spot!
 At first, Hao lianchuan thought that Li Hao was pretending ...
  But gradually, he didn't feel that way anymore.
 Li Hao's entire body was trembling, and he was sweating profusely.
 If he was still pretending, how terrifying was this guy?
 "Li Hao!"
 Hao lianchuan shouted. Liu Long's expression was not too good. He glanced at the experts around him but did not say anything.
 Li Hao's condition didn't seem right.
 After a long time, Li Hao raised his head. His eyes were bloodshot, as if he was in pain or in shock. Panting, he said,""I'm fine ... It's just ... My internal injuries acting up again. It's like ... Like a hidden force has exploded in my body ... I'm fine now."
 Hao lianchuan shot a cold glance at Fei Tian.
 Hu dingfang also looked at Kong Qi with murderous eyes.
 Hidden force?
 The other party had left a hidden hand?
 Being stared at by the two, Kong Qi actually felt very innocent. It had nothing to do with him. He really didn't attack Li Hao. He didn't even meet Li Hao, so why would he attack him?
 But now ... It was really hard to say.
 Moreover, Li Hao's condition did seem to be caused by his injuries. He was also helpless, and it was useless to explain. Moreover, as an assassin, he was not good at explaining.
 In the surroundings, the others were also silent.
 Li Hao was only a cultivator who had broken through the 100-point mark, so he didn't have much to do with the overall situation. However, this person's master was not simple. Yuan Shuo, the number one Martial Master of the dynasty, was an existence who had killed a late-stage three yang cultivator. If something happened to Li Hao here ... It might cause another storm of blood.
 A moment later, Li Hao, who was drenched, stood up and smiled.""I'm really fine now ... I'm sorry for scaring you all. Martial masters are like this. They often have some internal injuries, but fortunately, I have the blood God ... I might be able to recover soon!"
 After saying that, Li Hao swallowed another Blood God. This was the second one, the second one he had. In the blink of an eye, he only had one left.
 As for the high rate of consumption ... A normal person would naturally not consume his energy so quickly, but his injuries were too severe, so it seemed normal for him to consume his energy a little faster.
 In reality, the blood God's illusions from these two and the Dark moon's blood God illusions from before were all being rapidly absorbed by his five internal organs.  As a douqian Martial Master, he had accumulated a bit of force, which was actually very exhausting.
 Normally, he wouldn't have dared to eat it like this. The energy of the blood God had easily blocked his meridians and solidified them.
 But now ... Two blood deities had only healed the injuries in his five internal organs.
 At the same time, he also replenished all the blood essence and inner strength that he had consumed.
 Thousands of units were completely different from hundreds of units.
 From a small cup to a large wooden bucket, Li Hao's inner strength was much stronger than before. His blood was also different from before. The blood transfusion was complete.
 He didn't look at the two words again ... They were too terrifying.
 After taking the second shining sun Blood God, his breathing had recovered a lot, and his face wasn't as pale as before.
 In the eyes of the others, this scene was completely different.
 The Scion of the blood God ... Was a sacred healing medicine!
 Even if it didn't increase his Martial Master realm, just the healing effect alone was no small matter.
 Hao lianchuan did not say anything else. Instead, he looked at Ziyue and said in a deep voice,""Li Hao has already tried. You saw it too ... It's useless! Now, shouldn't you two give it a try?"
 Li Hao has already tested it. It's your turn.
 Zi Yue's face was calm, she didn't say anything, she just glanced at Hong Yitang from swords gate and then at Fei Tian, she said,""Fei Tian, there's someone who has passed the second passage. Fly five meters up and see if they will be attacked."
 On the flying heavens side, dingchen didn't say anything.
 This time, the Yama had paid two Blood God's pearls, while they had paid one. The Nightwalker had paid Li Hao, and the swords gate had paid Hong Yitang ... They had indeed paid the least.
 Therefore, he only glanced at a sunlit expert.
 The sun glory expert didn't say anything when he saw his leader looking at him. He quickly stomped on the ground and leaped into the air. In the blink of an eye, he was three meters high, five meters high, ten meters high ...
 Previously, they would be attacked when they were about five meters away.
  But this time, there was no such thing.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As expected!
 Many people were overjoyed. There were still many people left who had taken the second passageway. Other than the night patrols who had not taken the second passageway and those who were still alive, most of the others had taken the second passageway.
 According to the treatment of the ancient city ... They were guests!
 The others were considered stowaways.
 Guests had formal identities, so the restrictions weren't so strict. As for stowaways, they didn't care if they died or not!
 At this moment, Li Hao also saw this scene and couldn't help but look at Hao lianchuan.
 In fact, it was not bad to let a portion of them take the second passage.
 Otherwise, what would happen if the enemy took off?
 Right now, Liu Long was the only one who had taken the second passageway, so he should be able to take off as well.

 As for the others, including himself ... Li Hao didn't know if it would work, because martial masters didn't seem to have supernatural waves. In any case, he didn't dare to try it. Who knew if he, a Martial Master, would be killed by the attack?
 It was fine if they had not seen it, but they had seen the scene where Ziyue was almost killed. If Hao lianchuan did not say anything, no one would dare to try it. Even the three suns could not withstand it, let alone them.
 At this moment, Hu dingfang also frowned and sent a voice transmission,""Hao lianchuan, we should have let a portion of our people go through the second passage, even if you don't dare to ... I should have been the one to go. Otherwise, if we fall out with them and Ziyue and the others rise into the air ... How would we deal with them?"
 One could fly, and the other couldn 't. The difference between them was obvious.
 Not being able to fly was a restriction on the powerhouses.
 "No rush!"
 "What's the hurry?"Hao lianchuan replied telepathically." If you could fly, you'd have to go up and check the situation too. " Who knows what's behind us ... If a gold-tier warrior comes ... You're courting death! Now that they've gone up first, if we see that the situation is bad ... We'll run!"
 He knew that if they didn't go in, there would still be some limitations.
 However, it might not be worse than now.
 Didn't you see that Yaocheng had died inside?
  This time, the night watchmen still had more than 20 people alive. It was actually not easy. Not a single person from sunlight was lost ... This was already considered a miracle!
 Hao lianchuan felt that it would be worth it even if he had to go home now.
 Silver moon's Darksider organization had suffered heavy losses after this.
 Even his foundations in Silver Moon had been shaken!
 In front of them, Ziyue felt a little more at ease when she saw this. This time, Hao lianchuan did not lie to them. They could indeed fly.
 Hong Yitang was conflicted.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com F * ck the dog!
 So, I'm taking a risk?
 Zi Yue looked at him, and he also looked at Zi Yue ... After looking at Zi Yue for a long time and seeing that Zi Yue didn't have any intention of moving, Hong Yitang understood that she meant for him to go first.
 At this moment, you know to let me go first?
 Hong Yitang sighed and didn't say anything more. He stepped on the ground lightly and jumped up instantly.
 Seeing this, Ziyue followed.
 The hundred-meter high city wall was nothing to the three suns. There was no restriction on flying.
 The two of them, one in front and one behind, quickly climbed up.
 The moment Hong Yitang was about to reach the top of the city wall ... BOOM!
 A huge sword instantly slashed down!
 On the wall, a silver-tier warrior seemed to be extremely angry.
 In the next moment, some more black banners appeared on the wall. There weren't many of them, but some of them didn't pull out their swords this time. Instead, they pulled out their longbows.
 Dozens of long arrows were shot at the two of them!
 The silver sword slashed down, and Hong Yitang instantly fell to the ground with a loud bang. Ziyue, on the other hand, exploded with lightning, and the lightning-like lightning struck the silver warrior.
 With a loud bang, lightning flashed, and the silver-tier warrior also swayed slightly.  Zi Yue snorted coldly."Hong Yitang ... Take care of those soldiers!"
 On the city wall, the soldiers who fired the arrows weren't a big threat individually, but when they fired together, they were a threat to them.
 Hong Yitang didn't waste any time. He jumped up again and formed a yellow sword in his hand.
 He slashed out with his sword!
 BOOM!
 A black banner that was close to him was directly cut open by this sword. At this time, he could not care about preserving the black banner. He had to destroy the black banner first. The three suns could still destroy the black banner.
 ? As for the copper armor, it would be a little difficult. As for the silver armor ... He would have to use an origin god weapon.
 "Lure him down!"
 Someone transmitted.
 Ziyue might not be able to deal with the silver-armored man alone. She would only have a chance if she lured him down.
 Ziyue cursed under her breath. 'You think I don't want to?
 However, the silver chiliarch was no fool ... It seemed that the other party had some consciousness, and would not come down at all.
 The two of them exchanged dozens of blows at the edge of the city wall, but Zi Yue was still unable to climb up the city wall.
 Hong Yitang, on the other hand, was much more relaxed. He slashed again and again ... Soon, black skeletons fell from the wall.
 Bang Bang Bang!
 The ground was smashed, and the silver-tier warrior seemed to be extremely angry. He let out a weak roar and slashed again and again with his sword. He was extremely crazy, and even Zi Yue's five internal organs were shaken.
 However, no matter how furious he was, it was not going to be easy for him to deal with the flying Purple Moon.
 Below, the three suns, seeing that the person didn't come down ... Also attacked!
 They couldn't fly, but the three suns experts were all superpowers. They could display their strength even from a hundred meters away. They attacked one after another, and waves of superpowers burst out.
 The silver-tier powerhouse was also beaten up so badly that he couldn't even show his face.
  "Hong Yitang, go up and take a look!"
 They suppressed the silver-tier powerhouses and shouted one after another, hoping that Hong Yitang would go up the city wall to take a look and see what the inner city was like.
 Hong Yitang was also curious!
 Of course, he only dared to have this thought after seeing the silver-tier warrior being completely suppressed.
 Once again, he sent a Black Phoenix flying with a slash of his sword. He kicked the city wall slightly and used the force to leap into the air. At this moment ... He saw the inner city!
 Light!
 Yes, there was light in the inner city. Everyone had felt it before.
 However, at this moment ... Hong Yitang saw it even more clearly!
 It wasn't that there was a light source in the inner city. Instead, there was a huge tower-shaped building in the center of the inner city. The light source covered the entire inner city. It was dim and soft, almost as bright as the street lamps at night.
 On top of the tower, there seemed to be a turtle lying on the ground.
