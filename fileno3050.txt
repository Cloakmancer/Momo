He felt a little regretful."I had my eyes on Guangming, so I've been staying here. But now, old Zhang has gone to deal with chiyang. It's still a little difficult for me to officially enter level eight as a neo martial artist. Maybe ... I need to take chiyang down!" I have to meet up with them!"He looked at venerable the sword and said,"you and Lizhu can stay here. I don't need you for the time being. I'll go back and meet up with them. I'll see who can reach Level Seven this time ... If they're strong enough, we'll attack chiyang directly!""Neo martial ... It's time to enter the eighth rank!"His eyes were cold and sharp,'anyone who hasn't entered level eight would dare to find trouble! We'll kill them all sooner or later!"At this moment, he was exceptionally overbearing.He then looked at Li Hao and thought, three level 7s can't suppress Tian Fang! The new martial arts can only stir up trouble in the chiyang region for a while so that venerable sovereign Chi Yang can't come over. The Redmoon region is half crippled ... But there are still many strong people in the Dragon region and the tianfang region. They won't let go of tianfang's opportunity!""Red Moon master needs some time to recover, and so does the Alliance. Your time is limited!""Three level 7s should be enough to suppress them normally ..."As he said this, he laughed and looked at Kong Ji."Let my nephew's father take action, and the trouble will be much smaller. You do as you see fit!""Second cat, come out and meet me!" He looked at the river.As soon as he finished speaking, second cat emerged from the river.They had met before.Er Mao looked at him and felt a little uncomfortable. The human King laughed and took a step forward. He grabbed er Mao's head and rubbed it for a while. He laughed and said, "You're thinner than the big cat. You've lost weight these years! "Big cat is like a pig now. You've become slimmer. Come to new martial at any time. Big cat is waiting for you. Have enough dried fish!""I don't want to eat it," second cat mumbled."Tsk!"The human King snorted,"it's up to you whether you want to eat it or not. Is there a cat that doesn't eat fish?" We didn't force him to die. He's so pretentious. Of course, if he thinks it's meaningless, that's his business. I think it's interesting to live!""You ..."Second cat was a little angry. Pa! The human King slapped his head, "It's normal for a cat to eat fish, sleep, fish, and poop, but it's not normal for a cat to think about things. I didn't resurrect you to make you think about things. Since the new king of the Silver Moon has inherited that thing ... You can change owners and continue to be your cat. What's wrong with that?""Pa pa pa!"After he hit second cat's head, he felt better and laughed,""You people are very interesting, very interesting! I really like to make friends ... But of course, you have to be qualified to make friends. Right now, even if you're Wu Shan, you're still lacking a bit of qualification!""I'm not crazy ..."He laughed, and in the next moment, he burst into laughter. "He's crazy!""Anyway, let's work hard! The primal Chaos is too big, and the square domain is too small. They say I'm used to getting lost. No, the square domain is so small. How can I get lost?"He looked at the crowd and said,""I, new martial, want to attack Red Moon. I may have a chance ... But I haven't done it! "Neo martial is stronger than you think ... The Crimson Moon isn't the key ... Tian Fang is a very interesting place! Stay here and try to gain some insights. Perhaps you'll gain something!"This impetuous and seemingly straightforward human King suddenly kept him in suspense.Li Hao glanced at the human King, but the human King did not wait for him to ask. He smiled and said,""I'll leave first. The chaos is huge, but it's also very small. We can meet at any time!"Then, he looked at venerable the sword and waved his hand,""I'll stay here for a while and go home early!""I know.""Be careful on your way back. Don't cause any trouble on the way ..." Venerable the sword nodded."I know!""And ...""You talk too much nonsense. The older you are, the more long-winded you are. Am I still eighteen? I'm already over a thousand, I'm leaving!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared!Li Hao glanced at venerable the sword and suddenly felt envious.Under the surprised gazes of venerable the sword and the others, he suddenly released a person. Yuan Shuo was a little confused. He looked around and wondered, what's wrong?I'm still in seclusion!Li Hao glanced at Yuan Shuo and suddenly felt envious.""Teacher, other people's teachers are either Level Seven or level eight. They're very powerful ..."Yuan Shuo's face darkened!Lin Hongyu and the others were stunned for a moment. They avoided their gazes and looked around as if they were trying to hold in their laughter.Li Hao didn't care. He said enviously,"other people's fathers are either level 8 or level 9 ..."My father is only a level 8, not a level 9!Yuan Shuo was also speechless!Li Hao looked helpless."Teacher, my father is dead. I only have one teacher. He's a Heavenly King!" ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùYuan Shuo was completely embarrassed.He looked at Li Hao with a dark face, but Li Hao said innocently,""Just now, the human King came and left. When he left, the sword venerable warned him to be careful. He's a seventh level sword venerable!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùYuan Shuo couldn't hold it in any longer. He was furious."How old is the sword Saint?" More than a thousand. How old am I? I'm over 70! Give me a thousand years, and even a dog can reach the seventh rank!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe surroundings were filled with killing intent!Yuan Shuo suddenly came to a realization and coughed,""I'm sorry, I've ... Misspoken when I was lecturing my disciple!"Scolding was scolding, but he was still helpless.He gritted his teeth!I'm ... A Heavenly King!It was too heart-wrenching."More importantly, this grandson pulled me out in front of so many people and suddenly said to me that you're too weak. Look at how strong her father and master are ..."This was too murderous!He gritted his teeth and dived into the river. He was too ashamed to live. 'I won't come out until I become a venerable sovereign!'After they left, Li Hao grinned and looked at the crowd.""My teacher is a genius! Sooner or later, I'll be able to reach the seventh step!"Since he had already said so, who would say anything else?However, the sword Saint and the others were also surprised. Genius?Was it?I don't think so!Was a Heavenly King in his 70s very powerful?Venerable the sword thought for a moment. 'More than 70 ... I only rose to power in my 60s or 70S. I'm not even at the peak, so I might have a chance.'However, he was a little surprised by Li Hao's actions.He seemed to be hoping that his teacher would grow stronger, but ... Given how talented you are, will your teacher really be able to catch up to you?Why are you giving your teacher such a huge burden?Li Hao didn't say anything. He just smiled.My teacher is a genius!It was true!He'll be able to walk his own path sooner or later. I have to stimulate him. Every time I stimulate him, teacher will explode.He looked at the surroundings and then at heaven and earth. He smiled."Tian Fang is mine!" Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  At least, it's mine now!And not far away, the Senlan sector Lord was completely ignored by the human King. His illusory figure trembled before he spoke,"Silver Moon King, since the human King doesn't want it ... My share can be considered as a gift for fellow Daoist taking Tian Fang!"Li Hao glanced at him, smiled, and nodded.""Alright!"Sector Lord Sen LAN heaved a sigh of relief.This was good.Otherwise, it would be very awkward if this person didn't want it. Even though he had given this person what the human King didn't want ... It was fine as long as he accepted it. Li Hao laughed,"Silver Moon is poor, so I'll have to trouble you all for a while!" Three rank 7 venerable sovereigns ... Please return to Senlan as soon as possible, Senlan is not safe. The three of you can just guard the world gate!""Brother void, you're in charge of cleaning up the living beings inside the heaven's side and expelling them ... Just place them into a small world! Let's clean up Tian Fang!"Kong Ji nodded his head, filled with joy!A rank nine world was directly destroyed.Tier 7, I'm coming too!

Chapter 3051 Returning To Silver Moon Once More (1)
All the advanced venerable sovereigns in tianfang territory had retreated.In Kong Ji's eyes, it was easy to leave.To be able to drive away a group of venerable sovereigns at the cost of the death of two level Seven experts ... Anyone who thought it was easy could give it a try.This time, Li Hao didn't use the power of time.However, he had to borrow the power of neo martial, radiance, Senlan, and Wushan to drive those people away. It could be said that without them, Li Hao wouldn't even be able to touch the edge, let alone take down Tian Fang.There were too many venerable sovereigns who wanted to seize Tian Fang.Radiance and neo martial were comparable to the power of an eighth-rank world, while Wushan and Senlan were considered to have the power of a seventh-rank great world. They had borrowed the power of several great worlds at one time, and under their joint efforts, they had obtained the temporary ownership of the tianfang Kasaya.Of course, this was also the reward Li Hao had received from conquering the four worlds.He didn't take any of them. In the end, these people gave him a rank nine world in return.They were all temperamental people!People were divided into groups. This was the group of people that Li Hao had made friends with after he entered the chaos, and they were all worth making friends with.The three seventh rank venerable sovereigns were to guard the realm gate.In the end, Senlan didn't leave.Tian Fang had four realm gates, and considering that Li Hao didn't have the ability to guard all four, he chose to stay and help Li Hao defend them for a while.The four realm gates were guarded by four rank seven venerable sovereigns!Even Lizhu silently defended a realm gate.At this moment, the sky was extremely stable.If they wanted to break into Tian Fang, they might need to use six or seven Level Seven venerable sovereigns or two level eight venerable sovereigns. Otherwise, with four level Seven guardians, they could only attack Tian Fang with the full power of an entire level eight universe.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶He floated in the air and looked around.The sky was too big!It was unbelievably big.It was divided into four big domains, north, south, east and west. The big four domains were further divided into ten small domains. The Huilong temple was one of the small domains.As for the Dragon Temple's territory ... It was about the same size as Silver moon's before his promotion.In other words, tianfang world had at least 40 silver moons.In fact, it was more than that!Within tianfang world, there were still a large number of uninhabited lands.The Silver Moon, on the other hand, had fed tens of billions of lives. One could imagine that if Tian Fang had people, it would not be overcrowded even if 400 billion people were thrown in.It was an unbelievably huge world!And this was even after the destruction of the tianfang great Dao universe, causing the entire world to shrink by a lot. Otherwise, at its peak in the past, the entire tianfang would have been even bigger and could really support trillions of lives.Li Hao, a level five venerable sovereign, could not even spread his will to the southern region, let alone the entire sky. "It's too big!""Yup!"At the side, Kong Ji nodded."It's too big. It's comparable to light!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao turned his head and glanced at him. Kong Ji also looked at Li Hao and said seriously,""They're really going to compete soon!"Ëâπ!Li Hao cursed in his heart. So, your world of light is also so big?Then why are you sighing?Li Hao had only been to the Crimson Moon, but although the Crimson Moon was also big, it was not as big as tianfang. He had thought that light was the same, but it seemed that light was bigger. He wondered if light was stronger.Kong Ji didn't have the mood to talk about this and said,"Many venerable sovereigns have escaped from Tian Fang world. However, there were hundreds of venerable sovereigns in the entire Tian Fang world before. Now, there are at least a hundred venerable sovereigns in Tian Fang world. This is also a problem!"There were a total of 40 small regions, with one or two at the very least and more than ten venerable sovereigns at the very most. Tian Fang's forces had a large number of itinerant cultivators. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Although many of them had run away, including those who had run away before the arrival of the rank-7s, there were still at least 100 venerable sovereigns here in the huge Tian Fang. There were itinerant cultivators and some venerable sovereigns from small and medium-sized worlds.Itinerant cultivators had no world.The only difference between a venerable sovereign of a small or medium-sized world and an independent cultivator was that the venerable sovereign still preserved the world. With the existence of the world, there was hope of the birth of a great Dao universe. Without the world, there were no living creatures, and without ten thousand spirits, there was no hope of the birth of a great Dao universe.This was the difference!For people like venerable the sword, although they had formed a Dao net, it was no longer considered a Dao universe. It could only be considered a product similar to the Dao universe, a Dao domain!Dao domains were not Dao universes.Li Hao's River was the same.‚Äã "So many?""Right!""In addition, there are many Taoist connotation places in the entire tianfang," Kong Ji continued."There were many Taoist connotation places in Huilong temple, such as Dark Demon Ridge, Coiling Dragon Well, and fire Mountain. There are also many Taoist connotation places in other places."For itinerant cultivators, these Taoist connotation places are all treasure lands. Although many of them were destroyed before, these people are not willing to leave."At this moment, Kong Ji wasn't as excited as before. He was in a difficult position. "It's not easy to expel hundreds of venerable sovereigns at once! Unless ... We start a massacre!"Kill?They were all itinerant cultivators. Although it was said that there were no good people in the chaos, it was not easy being an itinerant cultivator.It was not easy for him to find a place to live after wandering the chaos.He had some opportunities here.Now, for the sake of the Nirvana world, he had chased away all these wandering cultivators ... Even if they didn't leave, were they really going to kill them all?Li Hao laughed."If it doesn't work ... We'll move those below venerable sovereign away. As for venerable sovereigns, we'll chase away some and keep some. As for the rest ... We'll let venerable sovereign Sen LAN see if we should subdue a group of them."The level 7 Senlan world originally had around 30 venerable sovereigns. Li Hao was not sure if the attack on the Crimson Moon was an accident or a cruel one, or if the venerable sovereign Senlan was too weak, resulting in the death of 10 venerable sovereigns.

Chapter 3052 Returning To Silver Moon Again (2)
And now, there were only 20 venerable sovereigns.A level Seven great world could accommodate fifty to sixty venerable sovereigns. A level eight great world could accommodate hundreds of venerable sovereigns.Having more venerable sovereigns was also a form of stability for the great path universe.As for itinerant cultivators ... They were actually very happy to join the great world.The premise was that the great world was willing to accept it.The Senlan world, which only had 20 venerable sovereigns, could still recruit 30 to 40 venerable sovereigns. Of course, it was impossible to recruit all of them. If that happened, the native cultivators of the Senlan world would have no hope.However, it wasn't a problem to take in ten or twenty of them. It was impossible for Senlan to produce dozens of venerable sovereigns in a short time.Kong Ji nodded and said,"that's true!" The seventh-rank Senlan had previously only maintained the standard of a sixth-rank beast. Later on, a group of people had died, so it was indeed possible to subdue a group of them. Other things aside, there were many middle-rank venerable sovereigns in tianfang world, and they were all Masters of small regions! I have some understanding of Tian Fang. I've been here for one or two hundred years ..."He wasn't a newbie and had stayed in the Dragon Temple for a few years. At this moment, he thought for a while and said,""A portion of the Rogue cultivators have a good reputation! The Senlan great world's reputation has risen this time. The Senlan Thearch has trapped and killed Deepsea ... As long as those fellows aren't afraid of Yunxiao's revenge, joining the Senlan great world is a good choice. "Li Hao also nodded.He also wanted to move everyone away as soon as possible and try to destroy the entire Outlander domain ... Once a tier 9 was completely destroyed, the Dao of Nirvana would definitely be fully displayed. Li Hao also cultivated Nirvana recovery.It was just not as powerful as the void.If there was a chance this time, he could also try."Right, this time, I'm going to face another life and death situation!" Li Hao added.Kong Ji frowned slightly."Is this the fourth time?"Li Hao nodded. It was the fourth time!He had no choice but to leave. This physical body had been almost completely destroyed after so many times. Even his Foundation had been crippled.Kong Ji frowned,"four times ... I did say that I'll die nine out of ten times ... But ... What if I die?" "There must be drawbacks to this kind of constant life and death. On neo martial's side, it's only a resurrection from life and death, but the drawbacks left behind make it impossible for human Kings to step into level eight!"The human King was very strong. This time, they had completely seen it.Not only was he powerful, but his Dao of Yin Yang was also at the peak of perfection. Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  For such a character, because there were too many resurrected people, their Yang Qi was completely exhausted, and the yin and yang of neo martial art were imbalanced. This was also the disadvantage of resurrected people.Of course, the human King had revived too many people.This was the fourth time that Li Hao had taken a life-and-death risk. There might be some serious repercussions.Li Hao said softly,"I've gone through the Dao of life and death three times. There were some things I didn't understand before. In fact, I understand a little now. The Samsara of life and death not only consumes energy, but also ... Lifespan!""Of course it will consume my lifespan, I know ...""No!" Li Hao shook his head."It's not the lifespan you're thinking of. It's ... The lifespan in the future!""I've reached rank 5!"He looked at Kong Ji. What did that mean?Kong Ji was startled.Li Hao sighed,"I'm at the fifth step!" When I was at rank three, I felt like my life was running out. When I was at rank four, I didn't feel like my life had increased. When I reached rank five...I realized that I was still the same!"Kong Ji's expression changed drastically!What did that mean?At this moment, he somewhat understood.Li Hao smiled."Do you understand?"Kong Ji's face turned ugly as he said in a low voice,"According to my estimation, a fifth level venerable sovereign would live for at least 800000 years if he really died! A third level venerable sovereign can only live for 500000 years at most ... You mean ... 300000 years of lifespan is gone when you advance from third level to fifth level?"Li Hao smiled."It's not that it disappeared ... It's just that after one reincarnation cycle, it's possible that ... It really will lose 100000 years of lifespan. Therefore, three reincarnations cost 300000 years!""Previously, I couldn't feel it clearly ... But after I advanced, I feel that it's about the same as before ... Putting aside the consumption of lifespan, the Dao of life and death might have lowered the limit!"The lifespan consumed by the Dao of time could still be recovered, but the lifespan consumed by the Dao of life and death could not be recovered.Each time, it would probably be 100000 years.In other words, if Li Hao walked the path of life and death again, he could have lived for 800000 years. If he walked it again, he might live for 400000 years, which was the limit of his lifespan.Was it very long?For Li Hao, it was unbelievably long.But in reality, it kept growing.Some Saints and Heavenly Kings could live for more than 100000 to 200000 years.Li Hao smiled."If I'm stuck at the fifth step and don't make any further progress, I might die of old age if I go through four life-and-death experiences!"Actually, it was nothing.He had only lived for slightly more than 20 years and had already seen many interesting things. However, there was a problem with the reduction of his lifespan limit. Activating time would consume his lifespan, which would shorten the duration of the time Dao.,m Kong Ji frowned."I believe that you'll reach Level Seven sooner or later. This isn't a problem ... However, a level Seven venerable sovereign usually only has a lifespan of about a million years. If you go through a few more reincarnations, you'll exhaust yourself to death!"Li Hao nodded.This was the logic.However, it didn't matter. He smiled and said,""A seventh rank venerable sovereign can live for a million years. Even if I walk nine times and consume 900000 years, I can still live for another 100000 years. Isn't that good enough?"Bullshit!Was 100,000 years really a long time?

Chapter 3053 Returning To Silver Moon Once More (3)
Ask Zhang an, ask the heavens!A hundred thousand years would pass by in a single sleep.It didn't grow at all.Most importantly, this was a permanent injury and not the kind that could be recovered. If it could be recovered, it wouldn't be a big problem. In fact, there was no lack of treasures in the chaos. Cultivating the Dao of life could increase and recover one's lifespan.However, a permanent reduction ... There was no other way."Let's not talk about this, you go do your thing first!"Li Hao smiled."I'm going to Silver Moon to take a look. Perhaps ... It's time for Silver Moon to be unsealed. Even though Silver Moon has only been sealed for a few months ..." Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  A few months was not considered long.More importantly, the chaos had lasted for more than 50 years, and 100000 years had passed in the Silver Moon.One to two thousand!It had been three to four months since Li Hao and the others sealed Silver Moon again. According to that ratio, Silver Moon had been sealed for at least 500 years!Of course, the last time it was closed for too long, so this time it was slightly shorter.The time ratio might not be that high.But even if it was less, a hundred years was probably the minimum.As the saying goes, a day in the sky is a year on earth. This was more or less the case. The ratio of more than 300 was normal.Several hundred years had passed ... And now, no one knew what had happened to Silver Moon.Was it a mess, or had a new king been born? or was Silver Moon still the same after five hundred years ... There must have been many who had died of old age because their path of cultivation had not been smooth.Those who hadn't reached the mountain Sea Sun Moon level wouldn't be able to live for five hundred years.He wondered if any of his acquaintances had died.Thinking of this, he thought of something and said,""Tian Fang, there should still be some of my Silver Moon cultivators here. If you encounter them, tell them to return first. Don't kill them by mistake!"Many of the Silver Moon cultivators were still training in Tian Fang.They might not have returned to the Dragon field. They might be somewhere else. When the battle broke out this time, they might not have been able to make it in time. He didn't even meet Nan Quan and the others. He didn't know where they were.Of course, there should be acquaintances training nearby, but the battle had just ended, so Li Hao didn't have the time to look for them."Don't worry, I know. "Kong Ji didn't say anything more, and neither did Li Hao. At this moment, the sky split open, and a crack appeared.This time, he didn't use any heaven's power.‚Äã It was just a small opening, and the chess pieces were still inside, so it was much simpler.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The void was torn apart.The shadow of the chess piece appeared.When he saw Li Hao, he sighed.""I didn't expect Tian Fang to fall into your hands. It's a surprise. A rank five venerable sovereign ... Might be able to fight a rank six, but Tian Fang ... Has never been in such a state."Even when they were at their weakest, they had four Grade 6 experts in charge. Of course, if one ignored the four level 7s ... Li Hao was indeed the weakest among them."I do now."Li Hao laughed,"this time, I have to thank you, senior, for helping to suppress qishui.""I'm just here to join in the fun. In fact, it doesn't matter if I'm here or not. ""What are you going to do while you're in charge of Tian Fang?""Nirvana heavenly square!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe shadow wanted to say something but stopped. Seeing this, Li Hao was a little confused."Senior, do you have something to say?""Not really ..."The mysterious man hesitated for a moment, but he still said,""Tian Fang was destroyed once, but it wasn't a big deal. It was the master of Tian Fang who personally destroyed it and took away all of Tian Fang's living beings! If he dies, it's not a big problem, but if you die ... I'm just worried that you'll shake the source of the tianfang world ... Be careful of a counterattack!""What?"Li Hao was puzzled."The world Energy is almost depleted. The origin of the world can still counterattack?""It's possible!""After all, this is the level nine world origin, not a weak world," the mysterious man explained."Even if it's a level eight world and a level nine world ... There's still a huge difference. Moreover, the master of Tian Fang isn't an Ordinary Level nine. He's the master of space. You can say that he's almost invincible between heaven and earth!"Li Hao frowned, nodded, and said no more."Senior, is Silvermoon alright?""It's fine. When they came in, they didn't pay much attention to Silvermoon .... They were all looking for the source of a great Dao, but it was destroyed long ago. It's not that easy to revive a ninth-rank great Dao!"He shook his head. These people were thinking too simply.Even if Li Hao had inherited some of Tian Fang's will, he had little hope of completely reviving the great Dao universe before he reached Level Seven.One could only imagine how difficult it was to truly revive Tian Fang.It wasn't difficult. It had been resuscitated long ago, so why would it wait for Li Hao?Li Hao looked into the void. Among the billions of dark stars, only the three vast stars of fire, darkness, and water were slightly brighter. The stars of darkness flickered, which had something to do with Li Hao borrowing some power from the chess.The Dao chess had always been nurtured in the dark Demon Ridge and had actually absorbed a lot of dark power.The entire universe was still extremely deserted."Qian Wuliang, uncle Hong!"Li Hao shouted, and a moment later, several venerable sovereigns arrived.Qian Wuliang and the others all entered.Looking at tianfang universe again, Hong Yitang sighed,""I've only been away for three to four months, but this period of time ... It feels like a long, long time!"He had done a lot of great things in the past few months.King yinghuai and the others killed venerable sovereign Awakener God, schemed against Sen LAN, and finally took over the four worlds. They also participated in the final battle to seize Tian Fang, and a bunch of rank seven venerable sovereigns died.The last time they left this place, they were only first or second level venerable sovereigns. None of them had even reached the third level.

Chapter 3054 Returning To Silver Moon Once More (3)
But this time, Qian Wuliang had reached Level 4, and Hong Yitang felt that he was almost there as well.Those who didn't know would think that tens of thousands of years had passed.It was even more so for Li Hao. Last time, he was at Level 3 ... But this time, he was at Level 5!"If director Zhao sees us again ... I don't know what he will think."Hong Yitang laughed.Previously, director Zhao had chosen to stay behind. Now, who knew how long it had been since Silver Moon. However, Silver moon's resources were limited, and there was a high chance that they had not reached the venerable sovereign level. Otherwise, they would have left Silver Moon long ago.The Silver Moon was still quiet, which meant that no one had reached the venerable sovereign level in the past few months."Let's go and take a look!"Li Hao didn't say much. This was Silver moon's opportunity!It was also an opportunity for the others, the two masters of the great Dao, and also for Black Panther ...As for himself, he had yet to see his opportunity.Entering the sixth step was simple.Right now, Li Hao had only filled a few hundred little realms. If one day, he could fill up a thousand little realms, and he might enter level six. It was very difficult, and the price he had to pay was too great.There were benefits to being difficult, and their foundations were extremely strong.While others cultivate one Dao domain, I cultivate thousands of Dao domains.This was the difference!Otherwise, how could a fifth-rank fight a seventh-rank, or a kindergartener fight a Bandit, hurt the other party?Now, he was able to join forces with Kong Ji to kill a tier 7 ... Although it was done by surprise, it was equivalent to him graduating from high school. He could also fight with a Bandit and stab the other party while the other party was not paying attention, and it could also take his life.They chatted for a while. Li Hao did not wait for Silver moon's group to arrive. Soon, he led them to Silver moon's location. Without the chess piece's cover, the world that looked like a star once again emitted a faint light.The silver World was exceptionally beautiful.He had seen many beautiful worlds ... But when he looked back, Silver Moon was still the most beautiful. At this moment, Li Hao no longer felt that Silver Moon belonged to the neo martial artists. The neo martial human King had already sold silver Moon to him.A level-seven universe!Although he had yet to pay for it ... Now that the IOU was in place, Silver Moon was officially his, his own world!At this moment, there was a sudden fluctuation in the void.A person appeared.Sword Saint!Venerable the sword, who was guarding the South world gate, suddenly appeared. He looked at Silvermoon and sighed,""The Silvermoon world! I haven't seen you for many years!"Then, he looked at Li Hao."Come and take a look. The southern gate is not far. We can reach it in an instant ...""It's fine!""Uncle li, how is Silver Moon compared to back then?" Li Hao chuckled."From the outside ... He looks more energetic, but I'm not sure about the details!""When it was first created, it was actually very, very small ... So small that it didn't seem like a world. This world grew very quickly!" Under normal circumstances, it's actually very difficult for the world to grow. "Li Hao nodded, somewhat enlightened. The Silvermoon world was actually growing on its own. Therefore, even if it absorbed some energy during the period of being sealed, it could still directly enter the ranks of medium-level worlds.This speed was something that the average world could not match."Let's unseal Silvermoon first!"Li Hao didn't waste any time and chatted for a while. Perhaps Silver Moon had passed for a long time.Soon, he landed on the wall of the world.The location of the Stargate!It hadn't been long since Silver Moon had been sealed. Li Hao thought that perhaps ... There would be a third time!That was because he was only staying here for a short time.Perhaps he would leave again soon.The Silver Moon was unsealed, but it couldn't face the current chaos.However, this time ... He had to give Silver Moon a chance to develop. Silver moon's population was not large. Ten billion might sound like a lot, but it was nothing compared to the great world!He touched the Stargate with one hand, and the Stargate trembled slightly.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Silvermoon.Compared to when Li Hao had been sealed off, the current Silver Moon world seemed to be completely different. Before Li Hao had been sealed off, Silver Moon had lacked time to develop, and many things had not been completed.He didn't have time to use some of the techniques and experiences he had inherited from neo martial.Ever since the Stargate was sealed for the second time ... It had been five hundred years since Silver Moon sealed it.500 years. The mortals had already passed down the legacy for dozens of generations.However, when Li Hao left, there were already hundreds of millions of cultivators in the world, and all their cultivation techniques had been left behind. Moreover, a large number of old people had chosen to stay.It wasn't like the neo martial arts of the past, where the inheritance was broken.For five hundred years, Silver Moon had continued some of Li Hao's governing ideas.The entire world was still centered around the Silver Moon marquisate. Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Over the past 500 years, the entire Silver Moon had undergone earth-shaking changes. Li Hao had left behind a lot of resources back then, and there were no signs of energy depletion like when new martial left.However, after five hundred years, the number of cultivators had increased from hundreds of millions to nearly ten billion. Everyone was cultivating!As a result, the resources that Li Hao had left behind were almost completely exhausted.The key was that in the tianfang great Dao universe, the entire universe was exhausted, and there was no way to absorb external energy.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment.Silver Moon marquisate.A group of cultivators were discussing.Compared to before, they were much stronger. Some of them had aged a lot, some had matured a lot, and some were about the same as before, not changing much.

Chapter 3055 Returning To Silver Moon Once More (3)
Director Zhao looked a little tired.In these 500 years, he was the most senior and the most powerful of the people who stayed behind. He had always been the one leading the changes in Silvermoon. From the beginning, he had been very comfortable with it. Towards the end, some new people rose up. Not only was his ruling position threatened, but more importantly ..... After 500 years, the Marchioness of Silvermoon had gradually become a legend in the eyes of the new generation.500 years?If he was in a deep sleep, it would not be long.If he didn't sleep ... That would be too long!The world was also in turmoil. Resources were limited and not infinite. The birth of a large number of cultivators had caused a series of problems in the entire Silvermoon world.Some of the younger generation even felt that old Zhao was rotten ... That he still maintained the age of a dictator and should be overthrown. As for Marchioness Silvermoon ... She had been gone for 500 years. Perhaps she had died long ago, or perhaps she had long forgotten about Silvermoon.Fortunately, a group of people from back then were still alive.This made director Zhao feel that ...... The world was still the same world. However, everything in front of him, other than the Silver Moon marquisate, was not a familiar place. There were many tall buildings, all sorts of cultures had risen, and there was even a new martial Dao.As he thought about all this, beside him, director Zhou, who was also a little tired, slowly said,"The world's energy is being consumed at a crazy rate. There are too many cultivators, and the reserves are all used up! Now, even the cultivation resources of some martial arts academies can't satisfy us!""The military and the government both lack energy. No one doesn't ..."He rubbed his temples, feeling a little tired.""The world can't obtain external energy and has to rely on its old Foundation. Now, some of the experts in the new generation are clamoring to open a Stargate!""If it weren't for the fact that we could still suppress them ... These guys would have opened it themselves! "Although five hundred years isn't too long ... It's much shorter than neo martial art's one hundred thousand years of silence, but ... If this goes on, we'll follow in neo martial art's footsteps. We don't have enough energy and can only enter a state of silence. If we can't step into the venerable sovereign level, we'll also lose our way when we enter the great Dao universe ..." Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  He said bitterly,"I used to think that it would be easy for Qian Wuliang and the others to reach the venerable sovereign level. I thought that after hundreds of years, some of us would become venerable sovereigns. In this case, we might be able to extract some energy when we enter the universe of Dao. But ..."He shook his head and sighed again.Because the two Dao Masters had left, they could also enter the Dao universe, but it was difficult to extract the energy inside. The key was that because the Dao Masters were not there, it was difficult for them to travel around the Dao universe after entering.Each time, he could only absorb a little bit of energy to satisfy some of his own cultivation. It was still not enough.This was the difference between having an owner and not.Years ago, when Li Hao was ownerless, he could enter and leave as he pleased. Now, he could easily be attacked by the Thunderbolts of the great path, which gave them a headache.When the resources were exhausted, the great Dao universe couldn't be completely opened ... So the only way was to open the Stargate.But in the outside world, perhaps not much time had passed.Perhaps, Li Hao was still being hunted down.If he opened a Stargate and went out ... It would be the same. Tianfang universe would be empty.The few of them were having a headache over this matter when suddenly, someone entered the door with some anger.""Quickly go and take a look. The situation isn't good. Those little guys of the new generation have gathered near the Stargate today. They are determined to open the Stargate and leave!" "Nonsense!"Director Zhao scolded and frowned,""Where are the demon-hunter guards guarding the Stargate? You didn't stop them?"The person looked at director Zhao helplessly and then looked at the others, sighing,""Not easy to manage! It's not easy to stop them, the leader is ..."He glanced at Liu Long, who was in the crowd.Liu Long's expression changed slightly, and he said in a low voice,"was it Liu Yin who led them?"The person nodded slightly.Liu Long, the current commander of the Demon Hunter guards, could be considered half a commander of the army, while the other half was controlled by Huang Yu.Liu Yin, Liu Long's son.On the 200th year after Li Hao and the others left, Liu Long married and got rid of his old Bachelor status. His wife was none other than commander Liu Yan, one of the five commanders of the Demon Hunter guards.Liu Yin was born a hundred years ago.A hundred years old wasn't considered young, but in their eyes, he was still a new generation.Now, he was also at the Dao integration stage.His combat strength was quite strong!In addition, his father and mother were both important military figures, so there were not many restrictions in Silver Moon. Liu Yin was one of the leaders among the new generation of people who clamored to open the Stargate. "Bastard!" Liu Long's face turned ugly.He was a little angry.Director Zhao sighed."Forget it. Let's go and take a look. He's too young. He doesn't know anything ..."Liu Long could not help but curse,"young?" Back then, we were in an unimaginably difficult situation. Silver Moon Marchioness was in her early twenties, but she fought against all sides to ensure Silver moon's safety. She's already a hundred years old, how can she still be young?"Even though he was scolding Liu Yin, he was still his son. The name Liu Yin was enough to show his hope.The silver from the Silver Moon!It was also the silver of a silver spear.The Liu Clan was one of the Silvermoon's three Spears in the past. However, in Liu Long's generation, they no longer cultivated spear techniques. Instead, Liu Long cultivated a short axe and walked the path of water. The current Liu Yin, on the other hand, walked the path of spear techniques.To be able to reach the Dao integration stage in just a hundred years, when countless cultivators were struggling with resources ... Liu Long and his wife had clearly paid an enormous price.

Chapter 3056 Returning To Silver Moon (1)
"Every generation has a different view of the young!" Director Zhao laughedThis was the truth.Only in turbulent, crazy, and dark times would age not be a restriction. Otherwise, in relatively peaceful times, when the old were strong, no matter how old they were, they would still look young.If it was back then, a hundred years old ... That would already be considered an old antique.Yuan Shuo was an old man in his 70S. He was a leading figure in the martial arts world, a very old leading figure."Let's go and take a look. We can't really break the Stargate!""I'm not asking everyone to open the Stargate," director Zhao said."There's no other reason than to give Silver Moon more time to build up his Foundation! Although it's very difficult now, once the Stargate is opened, time will flow at the same time. We don't have the ability to seal the Stargate!"With more time, he could still accumulate some strength. However, once he opened the Stargate, there would still be so many resources that could not be found outside. Without the accumulation of time, he would really have lived in vain.Liu Long didn't say much and went straight out.Just because the demon-hunter guards had given him and Liu Yan face and not caused trouble for his son didn't mean that they were truly invincible at the Dao integration stage.In the past, there had been very few Dao integration experts, but after five hundred years, there had been quite a few. The core members of the demon-hunter Army had all reached the Dao integration realm.The commanders, such as Wang Ming and the others, had all reached the seventh level of the Dao integration realm. If they really went crazy, his son, who was at the sixth level of the Dao integration realm, would still be tortured to death when he encountered Wang Ming and the others.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Under the Stargate. Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  At that moment, it was Wang Ming who was guarding this place.The frivolous and extremely young fellow of the past had matured and become more dignified.The demon-hunter guards had five commanders: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.The system Chief was Wang Ming.At that moment, Wang Ming stood under the Stargate and looked at the dozen or so young men and women across from him. They weren't weak; the weak were at the mountain sea level, while the strong, such as Liu Yin, were already at the sixth level of Dao integration.He frowned slightly and said,"go back!" Don't mess around! If it weren't for your father, I would've killed an ordinary person who trespassed this place!"The leading youth looked extremely unruly and said in dissatisfaction,""Uncle Wang ...""Call him commander!"Wang Ming couldn't be bothered to get close to him. This guy had been obedient when he was young, but now he was disobedient."There's no more hope for the world if the Stargate is closed. Silver moon's resources have been exhausted, and we can't even distribute much of them to the others. The rest of them are even worse off ..." Liu Yin was displeased and somewhat angry."There are no resources outside!"Wang Ming frowned,"how many times have I said this?" Outside, it's a silent universe of the great path, do you understand? There's nothing, everything is empty ... If there was, we would have left on our own. Why would we need to wait for you?""That was five hundred years ago. I'm not sure now!""Nonsense, it might only be a few months outside!"Wang Ming was a little annoyed."I, Silver Moon, haven't lost my legacy. I taught you when you were little!" "That might not be the case!"Liu Yin said,"maybe the time has been unified?" Also...Could the Marchioness of Silvermoon really completely seal the Silver Moon? Maybe ... He's just lying to you. In fact, the time is the same. He just doesn't want you to leave and wants you to guard his house!""Bastard!"Wang Ming was furious!Many of the younger generation were questioning whether the Marchioness of Silver Moon could completely seal off the world. If she couldn 't, how could the flow of time be different?It was precisely because they knew so much and had learned so much that they felt ... That it was utter nonsense. Silver Moon had not isolated himself from the outside world, but someone had done it. If that was the case, how could there be a time discrepancy?Therefore, in the hearts of the young people, they had many conjectures. Perhaps ... The Marchioness Silvermoon back then was just bluffing everyone. He hoped that these people would stay here and guard his home.Don't go out and run around!Outside, it might be a world full of flowers.Wang Ming was furious!He was also helpless.Questioning authority was a characteristic of the young. Weren't they the same back then?He questioned everything!He doubted neo martial, doubted Zhang an and the others, but ... When it was his turn, he was still very depressed. Damn it, am I stupider than you?You thought of it, but we didn 't?The key was that they were experienced and knew the situation.At that moment, Wang Ming was a little annoyed,"if you dare to talk nonsense again, don't blame me for not giving your parents face!" Did he think that he was very impressive just because he reached the sixth level of Dao integration at the age of 100? Do you know that all the cultivation resources you have now were obtained by Marchioness Silvermoon? at that time, he was only in his 20s! He's already rampaged through the chaos and killed countless people. Even venerable sovereigns are nothing in his hands ..."This group of young people, however, did not comment.Yes, he had learned it this way in the past, but ... Who knew what the truth was?Marchioness Silvermoon, in her 20s, killed venerable sovereigns as easily as killing chickens?Is that true?How strong were venerable sovereigns?They had never seen a venerable sovereign before, so they thought that perhaps ... It was similar to the Dao integration.In this case, when we go out, we will also be able to move unhindered!This was a problem of vision.No matter how the elders repeated the power of venerable sovereigns ... It was useless, because it was different from back then. Back then, there was a sealed venerable sovereign here, and there was a half-step sovereign who was close to the venerable sovereign level. He was extremely powerful and kept giving everyone pressure.Now, there were only his own people.These five hundred years actually lacked the corresponding pressure.Just as he said that, someone behind him shouted angrily,""Bastard, are you looking for death?"

Chapter 3057 Returning To Silver Moon (3)
BOOM!A huge hand came down from the sky. Liu Yin's expression changed. He turned around and saw that his father had arrived!Just as he was about to say something, the big hand fell.BOOM!He was suppressed directly!The waves on Liu Long's body fluctuated, and he was a little annoyed. He glanced at Wang Ming."Why don't you just take him down?"Wang Ming rolled his eyes.I want to!More importantly, if you don't tell me, where's your wife?If he really did take it down, he might even come after me.Liu Long suppressed his son like he was suppressing a little chick. He said angrily,""You're only at the sixth level of the Dao integration stage, not even comparable to Marchioness Silvermoon's third level of Dao integration stage power. Is it because you've lived in peace for too long that you feel that the people of the world are nothing more than this?""Father ..."Liu Yin, who was suppressed, was still unconvinced.""It's all just what you said ... I want to open the Stargate and go out to see the world you speak of. What's wrong with that? There are countless venerable sovereigns and experts everywhere. To kill a Dao integration expert with a single blow ... He must have died from bragging, right?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLiu Long was furious. With a creak, he pinched his son, causing him to scream in pain. However, he was helpless.He had no way to prove how powerful venerable sovereigns were.This was the most sorrowful thing!He was not a venerable sovereign, even if he had reached the ninth level of Dao integration.There was a huge gap between him and his son, but in his son's eyes ... He couldn't blow him to death with a single breath. What was he bragging about!Liu Long's last regret was ... He should have allowed Li Hao to leave behind a venerable sovereign!Only then would these Dao integration stage brats realize how powerful venerable sovereigns were, and how dangerous the outside world was!At this moment, director Zhao and the others had also arrived.Director Zhao, who had already reached the seventh level of Dao integration, was only at the ninth level now.At this moment, he looked at the crowd and sighed,""Alright, let him go! It's our fault for not being able to enter the venerable sovereign realm. These brats are also worried about the lack of resources ..."If he wanted to leave, wasn't it because he didn't have any resources?We can't create resources out of thin air!If they had become venerable sovereigns, they could still communicate with the great Dao universe and extract some of it. But now ... They could only say that they were too useless.Liu Long furrowed his brows and sighed,"I have to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys! Otherwise ... If this continued, there would be unrest! Liu Yin ..."He was a little hesitant. In the end, he gritted his teeth and said,""Let's use him as an example! He was too bold, daring to barge into the Stargate ... This shouldn't boost his arrogance! I can't bear to kill him, so I crippled his martial arts and locked him up as a warning to others!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLiu Yin's face was dazed. This ... Seriously? However, Liu Long appeared to be very serious.He couldn't bear to kill his son, but ... If this continued, chaos would break out sooner or later!He could only kill the chicken to warn the monkeys! Everyone was giving him face, but he couldn't not give face to the others and Li Hao. Even if Li Hao didn't care, he couldn't indulge these guys!"You don't have to ..."Before director Zhao could finish his sentence, Liu Long crushed the countless Dao meridians in his son's body under everyone's shocked gaze.In an instant, the world fell silent!Liu Long's expression was calm,"that's it. As for the others ... Deal with them the same way. This is the first time. If there's a next time, kill them all!" There's no order without rules. If this continues, there'll be a rebellion!""I'm trying to save him ... If there's a next time and he really revolts ... He's back, and even if he doesn't care, what's there for him to be reluctant to part with now that Silver moon's own people have rebelled? Director Zhao, there's no need to affect the entire Silver Moon just because of my family matters. These kids don't understand that without the protection of the Duke ... Silver Moon would have been destroyed countless times already. The safety of billions of lives compared to my son ... I'm very clear who is more important! We only crippled him, not killed him. That's already favoritism!""This ..."Director Zhao sighed. Liu Long was still the same as before. He was crippled just like that. Now ... Things were going to be difficult.On the ground, Liu Yin's face had already turned ashen!I've been crippled?The other young men and women were all trembling in fear. Seeing this, Liu Long snorted, "You're as timid as a mouse, you haven't experienced war, and you still want to play big? If you go out, you won't live for more than a day!"Everyone did not dare to make a sound. At this moment, their faces were somewhat pale.Liu Long wanted to say a few more words, but director Zhao suddenly frowned and looked up at the sky. In the sky, the Stargate seemed to be shaking.He was a little stunned.Liu Long was also slightly startled as he quickly raised his head. At this moment, countless people looked up and saw that the red door in the sky was gradually beginning to shake violently!Just when everyone was surprised and nervous.Suddenly, the Stargate opened!With a boom, the Stargate opened.A person flew down from the sky with a smile on his face. He looked down and was a little happy ... But also a little confused. It seemed like ... Something had happened here?Of course, it didn't matter.In an instant, a majestic pressure suppressed the entire world!It wasn't intentional. He had used a little bit of strength to open the Stargate. A fifth rank venerable sovereign could suppress the world in Silver Moon with just a little bit of pressure.At the same time, the venerable sovereigns stepped into the Silver Moon one after another! p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The aura of the sword Saint shook the entire heaven and earth. He looked at Silver Moon and sighed,""You've changed a lot ...""Is this Silver Moon?"At this moment, a person entered. It was Kong Ji, who had just gone to work. He looked around and was a little surprised."I thought Silver Moon would be quite powerful ... But why ... So weak!"

Chapter 3058 Returning To Silver Moon Once More (8)
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùNonsense!Li Hao was speechless. Silver Moon had only just advanced to an intermediate world, and even venerable sovereigns had left. Of course, he was not powerful.Venerable sovereigns appeared in the sky.The entire Silvermoon world seemed to be shaken by these venerable sovereigns. Everyone's eyes were focused on these people. A few venerable sovereigns who did not deliberately conceal their auras were even more painful to look at.In contrast to them, director Zhao and the others, who were previously thought to have reached the limit of cultivation ... Were not even worth mentioning!"Eh? boss, your descendant?"Li Hao glanced at Liu Yin, somewhat surprised. It was a familiar bloodline aura. It was Liu Long 's.Was he ... Married and had children?Liu Long nodded his head in a daze. He was a little surprised that Li Hao had returned.Li Hao smiled,"this ... What's wrong?" You hit him? You hit your own children and grandchildren like this? Boss, you're really ..."Shaking his head, Li Hao laughed and casually waved his hand. In an instant, Liu Yin, who had just been crippled, was restored to his peak. It was only an instant, but it was as if nothing had happened.Liu Yin was extremely stunned!This ... Marchioness Silvermoon?With a wave of his hand, the crippled sixth level Dao integration cultivator had actually recovered. Even his Dao meridians ... Had instantly recovered without any signs of being crippled.This ... Was unbelievable!Liu Long wanted to say something, but Li Hao chuckled and said softly,""I'm back!"At this moment, only his voice could be heard in the world.At this moment, a heaven-shaking roar suddenly resounded in the previously silent world."Lord Marquis has returned!""Greetings, Lord Marquis!"In the past, Liu Yin and the others had thought that the old men were on the verge of extinction ... Had suddenly appeared in countless numbers!The roar was monstrous!Countless Dao integration cultivators, countless sun and moon, and countless mountain and sea realm experts rose into the air from all the old men who had seemingly disappeared! It covered the sky! It was unimaginable!Countless members of the younger generation were also dumbstruck. Some of them looked around at their unremarkable neighbors and friends, and some of them looked like elderly people basking in the sun. All of them were either sun, moon, or Dao integration experts .... And were completely dazed!These people ... Were they all old people from 500 years ago?There were still so many powerhouses alive!"Good, very good ... I'm very happy to see you all again!"At this moment, Li Hao's laughter was the only sound in the world. A figure appeared in everyone's mind. It was Li Hao.With a wave of his hand, the rain of life fell from the sky. Countless old people who had been dried up or had hidden injuries all recovered in an instant, and their strength even increased greatly.Li Hao chuckled."Not bad ... I've come back this time to take everyone out to have a look. Of course, before that ... I hope that my old friends and old acquaintances can all become venerable sovereigns. This time, I've brought back dozens of worlds larger than Silver Moon. I'll merge with Silver Moon. This is your chance!"Dumbfounded!What?Dozens of worlds?These thoughts were only for the younger generation. The older generation of cultivators were used to it, but they were extremely excited. Marchioness Silvermoon was omnipotent!It was too normal!Many people looked at those young people. They were just too lazy to pay attention to them. They were just a bunch of ignorant kids!Back then, we followed the Marchioness of Silvermoon and fought together!At this moment, the old men who had been in despair all roared out. It was as if they had returned to 500 years ago.Li Hao couldn't understand the excitement in her voice, because he had only been away for a few months.Of course, he could understand the difference. To them ... He had been gone for too long. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao also sighed when he looked at Silver Moon.I don't want to Seal Silver Moon off anymore.But ... Silver Moon was too weak.

Chapter 3059 The Return Of The Rich (1)
Five hundred years!In the blink of an eye, a few months in the outside world was equivalent to five hundred years in the Silver Moon!This was the transformation of the sea into mulberry fields!Li Hao actually did not feel anything about a hundred thousand years old neo martial artist. Perhaps only neo martial artists could feel it. However, when he returned to Silver Moon, the acquaintance he was familiar with hundreds of years ago was a young man ...In the blink of an eye, Liu Long's son was already a hundred years old.Wang Ming and the others were more than five hundred years old.For director Zhao and the others, it was fine if they didn't have a family, but for those who had a family and a career ... Liu Long's son was considered young, while some people's grandsons had already been born.This was the true blade of time!The feeling of time and space intersecting with each other made Li Hao a little absent-minded.Five hundred years!When he sensed all of this, he simply stood in place, looking at the old men who blotted out the sun. Some of them had yet to reach the sun Moon tier, and those in the mountain and sea realm below the sun Moon tier were actually nearing the end of their lifespans. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In theory, Shanhai could live for about a thousand years ... But theory was just theory.Time flowed on his body.At this moment, he only silently looked at everyone with a smile on his face. He looked at the groups of his former comrades ... There were Demon Hunter squads, Demon Hunter guards, and Demon Hunter Army members ...There were some that he recognized and some that he didn 't.There were also some that he had not been familiar with in the past, and some had even been ordinary residents. However, in 500 years, almost all those who had not reached the mountain and sea realm had died of old age, and those who had survived were naturally powerful cultivators.It was obvious that it was difficult for a Martial Master at the thousand-man level to live to this day.Li Hao looked around and scanned the world with his divine sense. At this moment, he seemed to be searching for something.Qian Wuliang and the others looked at each other.In this world, almost all the people he was familiar with were here.Li Hao, who should I look for?If someone really died of old age, they wouldn't be familiar with Li Hao. If they were familiar with him ... They wouldn't die of old age. The mountain sea realm was relatively simple.After a long time, Li Hao sighed and said softly,""Time is a pig slaughtering knife ..."Everyone was still wondering if someone familiar had died.Li Hao sighed and shook his head."Yu dami is more than 500 years old, but the Marquis is not back yet. I saw her activating her martial arts and changing her appearance ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEveryone was stunned for a moment.Li Hao sighed again,"sister Liu Yan, you're also old ..."Liu Long was embarrassed."Hong Qing ... Was still very young and tender at that time. Now ... He's also old, even older than martial uncle Hong ..."Hong Yitang was a little confused. 'F * ck, can you stop?'"Aunty Hong Xiu ... Has white hair." Hong Yitang had a complicated expression. Shut up!Why is your mouth full of women?"You've opened the Silver Moon Stargate with great difficulty. Now, everyone is looking at you, waiting for you, and expecting you. You ... Why are you talking about this out of the blue?Li Hao sighed with emotion and looked at the people in front of him.Many familiar faces.Director Zhao, Liu Long, Wang Ming, Huang Yu, the aquamarine light sword ...Back then, there was a group of people who chose to stay in Silver Moon instead of leaving. Now, they were all tyrants of Silver Moon and top figures, but Li Hao only felt sad." 500 years, I'm getting old!" ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùAt this moment, someone couldn't help but cough.""Actually ... It's nothing, right? My clone has been sleeping here for a hundred thousand years, no, five hundred years ..."Those who didn't know would think that 500000 years had passed!Was there a need?Aren't they all here?You won't be familiar with the dead ones.It was normal to grow old, get sick, and die. They were just strangers. Which day did people not die?If they didn't die, the population of Silver Moon would exceed 100 billion in 500 years.At this moment, Wang Ming seemed a little nervous, but also a little familiar and strange. For Li Hao, he had only been away for a few months, but for them, five hundred years had passed!It was too long ago!His memories of Li Hao were actually a little fuzzy. Now, when he saw Li Hao, he didn't feel as close to him as he had in the past ... But more respectful.He wanted to try to change, to be more intimate, to be more thick-skinned, but in the end, he still couldn't do it. He could only say softly,""Lord Marquis, we've been waiting for you!"Li Hao patted his shoulder and chuckled.""Cheap Junior Brother, why did you change the way you address me?"Wang Ming was a little embarrassed.They were young and ignorant. At that time, they liked to go around saying that they were Li Hao's junior ... In reality, Yuan Shuo had only said it casually and had never truly treated them as his disciples.But back then, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo didn't care about what he said.Now, it had been 500 years. Sometimes, when he thought back to the past, he still felt a little sad.When Li Hao patted her on the shoulder, she felt like she had returned to the past.Suddenly, she had the urge to cry. She lowered her head. She was more than 500 years old, but at this moment, she was still a little frivolous. She lowered her head and said,""Five hundred years ago, perhaps ... I should have gone out ... Even if I was weak, even if I died outside, at least ... I know that we are still in the same time and space ..."Five hundred years. He knew that Li Hao's group was outside, but it felt like a different time and space.Li Hao did not say anything."There's no need for that. I've only been away from Silver Moon for about 50 years, but it's been more than 100000 years. The Li family of the past are all gone ..."Venerable the sword chimed in.It was to comfort Li Hao, as well as Wang Ming and the others.
