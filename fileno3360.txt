"Let's check the surroundings first ..."Some experts quickly disappeared.The remaining group was still observing. The four-sided region was in chaos and many experts were escaping. To them, this was an opportunity, but it could also be a danger. It was nothing for the weak to escape.However, once a top-notch expert escaped, and it was the kind that could do so silently, it would be very dangerous.……Thunder World.In the main hall.Li Hao asked about the situation. This level four venerable sovereign did not seem to know much."According to Daoist Kang Han's meaning ... This outer region ... No, for you, this is the entire chaos, and the square region is only a remote corner. It's also a closed area. The entire chaos is vast and boundless, divided into Nine Heavens?""Yes, yes!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "It's actually a simple division, but under normal circumstances, everyone will abide by it! The primordial chaos has no directions, no directions, no directions ... But in order to avoid unnecessary trouble, the primordial chaos has divided the various worlds into nine heavenes...And the level of the world will be the level of activity. ""There's actually nothing specific to isolate it. Under normal circumstances, there'll be some dense chaotic force mixed in between the world and it'll be easily separated ..."The chaos was divided into nine levels.One rank corresponded to one level.In fact, other than the division of hierarchy and strength, there were also some advantages to preventing the weak from clashing with the strong. This was probably the effect."Apart from this, are there many Overlord forces ... Or great worlds above level 8 in the chaos?"Kang Han said nervously,"our realm is only a Tier 6 world and doesn't know much about high-level worlds. We only know that the chaos heaven world has risen in the West. The chaos heaven Supreme Emperor has advanced to tier 9 and is sweeping through the chaos, wanting to swallow the world ... In the North, there is the five elements Supreme Emperor. The five elements world is extremely powerful. It is said that there are five tier 8 powerhouses with all five elements. If they join forces, they can fight against tier 9 powerhouses!""In the South, there's the Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn. He's said to be a demon venerable and is extremely powerful. He also has level eight experts under him. Great demons run amuck. It's said that the Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn can control time. With one cry, he can change the world ..."Eh?Li Hao was stunned. Time?Spring and autumn?He was stunned for a moment. In the four regions, ordinary people didn't know about the art of time at all. There was actually an expert here who had mastered time, and he was from the demon race. How ... How was this possible?Of course, he wouldn't underestimate the heroes of the world, but ... He was still a little surprised.The spring Autumn Emperor?Big demon? "Then, which territory does our square region belong to?" "The four-sided domain belongs to the end of the East ...""There aren't any extremely powerful great worlds in the East, but there are many powerful worlds, all of which are rank eight worlds," Imperial master Kang Han said hurriedly."For example, the Twin worlds not far from here have two rank eight venerable sovereigns. The heavenly yang and earthly yang venerable sovereigns are all rank eight existences, and they have many rank seven subordinates who are extremely powerful! Further away is the world of reincarnation. It's said that the reincarnation Emperor controls life and death and is also extremely powerful. He also seems to have two rank eight existences under him ... In addition, there are several rank eight worlds here, all extremely powerful ..."He explained,"the East doesn't have an absolute Overlord force, but there are many level eight worlds. The reason why there aren't any is that it's said that a million years ago, the lord of the sky left the four-side region and seemed to ... Seemed to have killed a few top powerhouses and destroyed some worlds. Many of the great worlds in the East region today were born in the past million years."In other words, there might have been an absolute Overlord force similar to the other regions here, but it had been killed by the master of tianfang.Therefore, after a million years, there was still no peerless Overlord in this place.In their eyes, the so-called unparalleled Overlord could possibly ... Even rival a ninth-rank?Li Hao took a deep breath.In that case, the strongest Dragon Lord in my four-direction region coming here isn't much?There was a huge difference between the eighth and ninth step.But ...Li Hao frowned slightly. Were there so many existences at the eighth step that could rival those at the ninth step?Chaos heaven, spring and autumn, five elements ...One was a grade-9, one could control time, and one had five grade-8 cultivators of the five elements, who could combine the five elements into one ...Twin universes, he knew about this.The sun of heaven and earth?Who was the one who was killed by the Dragon Lord last time?Who was the one who escaped from neo martial?It didn't seem to be a good feeling. It was said that Wushan could even fight with the other party for a while, although the other party didn't come with a world and wasn't at his peak.Li Hao nodded slightly,'then ... Is there a world that's open to the outside world here? I'm talking about the great worlds, such as the exchange of great DAOs and the like, where they trade some items, or other things ...""There are!"Kang Han immediately said,"in the nine-layered barrier, which is the chaotic area that divides worlds, such a place exists, but it is not a world. Worlds are usually not open to the outside world. Instead, it is an isolated island of chaos ... It is a man-made desolate Island continent of chaos. Some of these places are occupied by experts, and they accept itinerant cultivators and open trade. Generally, some safety is guaranteed, but some fees will be charged.""We can also exchange great DAOs. Some wandering venerable sovereigns will also exchange ideas, but ... Senior, you should know that great DAOs are unique. Even if they are of the same attribute, they may not be the same. When communicating with others, you have to be more careful ..."

After saying that, he cautiously glanced at Li Hao and continued,""Of course, there are also some deserted islands controlled by experts from the great worlds. They are safer and have more experts. They trade for some worlds, great Dao crystals, monarch weapons, and even Dao techniques. Of course, there are also those that trade for slaves ..."Slave?Li Hao was deep in thought."Are there many wars here?" he asked softly."War?"Kang Han was a little nervous. He glanced at Li Hao."What senior is referring to ... Is it a war between worlds, or a war between worlds?""Of course it's between worlds,""A little, but not too much ... But there's been a little more recently.""Huntian Supreme Emperor," he sighed,"he came from the West and was said to want to establish a unified huntian universe! The other overlords are also rapidly expanding their forces. Although our East doesn't have such a peerless Overlord, there are many rank 8 worlds, and they are also fighting each other. It's hard for small and medium-sized worlds like us. ""In the early days, the small and medium-sized worlds were still peaceful ..." He said helplessly."But now, there are ninth-rank venerable sovereigns in the chaos. It's not peaceful anymore. There are many venerable sovereigns from small and medium-sized worlds near the Thunder Zone. On one hand, they hope to accept some experts from the square zone. On the other hand, they also want to find out the situation and see if they can take refuge in the square zone ...""Take refuge in the four-sided domain?" Li Hao chuckled.The square region was in chaos!These outer-domain experts actually wanted to take refuge inside ... Fine, they really dared to think about it.However, it was also interesting.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The people from the square region wanted to come out to take refuge, while the people outside wanted to go in to take refuge. The Thunder region had become a dividing line, making these people feel that this was a natural sanctuary."Have you seen the spring Autumn Emperor from the South?"Li Hao felt that he had asked nothing.As expected, Kang Han was a little embarrassed."That's the Overlord of the South. Besides ... We say that we're in the North, South, East, and West, but to US Middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns, it's too big. We might not be able to walk through an Eastern Region in our lifetime!"He had only seen a few eighth-order great worlds in the East, let alone the overlords in the South. They were all extremely far away. They didn't have a great Dao universe to travel to, so they could only fly!How long would they have to fly?It was normal to take ten to a hundred years to travel. The weaker venerable sovereigns would be killed before they could reach the place. Who would dare to go too far?"Is there ... A teleportation formation in the outer region?""Teleport?" "Teleportation?" Thearch Kang Han was stunned. He shook his head."It's possible to build some teleportations in the inner world. However, in the chaos, the chaotic DAOs are everywhere. If you want to build a teleportation system here ... Unless the master of Tian Fang appears again!"Clearly, they also knew that the master of Tian Fang was a tier 9 space Dao expert.Li Hao nodded. It seemed that no powerful space-type venerable sovereign had been born here."Then the outer realm...Is the primordial chaos. Are the chaos beasts powerful?""Chaos Beast?"Kang Han shook his head and said,"he's not considered strong, but he's a huge threat to itinerant cultivators!" Most chaos beasts were born in the chaos and did not have a fixed residence. They devoured worlds at will and were The Public Enemy of many worlds. Some areas would periodically clean up chaos beasts. Some deserted islands will sell chaos beasts. The good thing about them is that they can be brought to worlds. If they are tamed, it won't be hard for them to carry small and medium worlds. ""In the primal Chaos, there are many great beings who specialize in capturing Primal Chaos beasts and selling them to the Lords of small and medium-sized worlds ... Of course, there are also some peak existences who might even go and capture Level Seven Primal Chaos beasts ... There are many of them that we can imagine!"Kang Han sighed."There are some seventh-rank Supreme emperors among the chaos beasts. It seems easier for them to advance to the seventh rank than the human race. Moreover, they can control a great world. For many Lords of a great world, they can spend all their fortune to buy a seventh-rank Chaos Beast. Not only can they be used as a teleporter, but they can also be a Vanguard in battle. Chaos beasts have very strong physical bodies ...""Capture a rank 7 Chaos Beast?"Li Hao was a little surprised."Under normal circumstances, it's difficult to capture a Lord of the seventh step, right? could it be a Lord of the eighth step?" he thought. The price isn't low, and not many people can afford it, right?" "The price is very high ... I don't know the details, I've only heard of it ..."Li Hao nodded again.The Dragon Lord wasn't here. If he were here, he might flip out. Of course, it had nothing to do with Li Hao.To Li Hao, he had previously killed a large number of chaos beasts because they ate humans indiscriminately. To the Dragon Master, if humans could eat chaos beasts and capture them as slaves, why couldn't the chaos race eat humans?This was a natural conflict between races.The key point was that there was a problem with the Beasts of Chaos. They could not create worlds and ate worlds as food. This was a natural contradiction.If the other party did not devour the world and relied on devouring the chaotic energy in the chaos, it would be difficult for him to improve.It could only be said that such conflicts and even hatred were natural and unavoidable.Li Hao seemed to be thinking about something. After a long time, he asked,"Do you know where the Twin universes are?""Ah?"The other party was stunned. After a while, he said,""I know. The Twin universes are the closest level eight world to us. It will take me about three years to reach the eighth heaven from here with my speed ... But if you are a high-stage venerable sovereign, you can reach it in a month without using the great Dao universe. If you use the great Dao universe, it will be even faster ..."

Chapter 3362 The Two Kings Travel Everywhere
With the great Dao universe, they could travel very quickly.Li Hao nodded. In that case, it was indeed not far.However, it would take more than a month for even a high-level venerable sovereign ... In fact, it was still far away. The entire chaos was indeed much larger than the square domain. In Li Hao's eyes, the square domain was already terrifyingly large!But now it seemed ... It really wasn't that big."Is there a boundary to chaos?"Li Hao asked again.There were four regions, but the edges were all the Thunder region. Since this place was divided into North, South, East, and West, was there a border?"Ah?"Kang Han was startled again, a little surprised. Why did this person keep asking strange questions?He thought for a moment and said,"this ... I'm not too sure, but I've heard that there is. But it's different from the edge in the ordinary sense. The edge of chaos is also chaos, but it's a mess. Once you get close, you'll completely lose your mind and fall into the crazy lawless lands!"The lawless lands?Li Hao was slightly moved."Lawless lands?""Yes, that's what I've heard. I don't know the details because we're weak. We've never been to such a far place. It's said that some advanced venerable sovereigns have been there and went crazy ... Even advanced venerable sovereigns have gone crazy ...""That's why we don't dare to go even if we know. It's too dangerous."Li Hao fell into deep thought again.The edge of chaos was also chaos, but it was completely without order. Even a high-level venerable sovereign would go crazy if he entered. This kind of lawless land was a little scary.He thought that the current chaos was already chaotic enough and was not friendly to those below venerable sovereign. Those below venerable sovereign were either dead or crazy when they left the world. In other words, the edge was much more dangerous."Then do you know where the ninth rank venerable sovereigns went?""What?""The master of Tian Fang and the others.""The master of tianfang and the others shouldn't be dead," Li Hao said."Do you know where they are?""What?"Kang Han was stunned."He's not dead?"How was that possible?Li Hao frowned. This meant that the other party didn't know that the master of Tian Fang was still alive.However, Tian Fang's master was definitely still alive.If he really died, tianfang universe might be completely destroyed.Those who had never been to Tian Fang weren't sure, but those who had been to Tian Fang, if they were experts, should have some judgment. The Lord of Tian Fang, the Lord of calamity, these existences might all be alive. Since that was the case, where did these grade-9 experts go?He had thought that he would get some information when he reached the outer region.Perhaps this Kang Han was too weak and knew too little information. Perhaps the powerhouses from the outer domain were actually not sure either. Or perhaps they thought that they were already dead. As for why the tianfang great Dao universe still existed, it might have been destroyed in advance, so it was preserved?As for Li Hao, he had sensed something and knew that there was a 99% chance that the other party was still alive.These thoughts kept appearing in his mind.Li Hao glanced at Kang Han ... A fourth stage venerable sovereign was not considered weak, but he knew too little."If I may ask again ... Are there any top powerhouses who preach in public in the chaos?"“……”Kang Han felt awkward. This ... Why would you ask such a question?Of course not!Seeing this, Li Hao was silent for a long time before he said,""In that case, none of the Supreme experts of the primordial chaos are willing to publicly preach?"It was normal for him to know, but ... It was still a pity that he didn't get a single one.Unfortunately ...At this moment, Li Hao was very interested in the communication of Dao.He wanted to gather 10000 DAOs, but the prerequisite was that one had to have some understanding of the 10000 DAOs. He had actually seen many and comprehended many, but most of them were not strong. Only the great DAOs of top experts were strong enough."After exchanging and sparring, a top-notch existence might be comparable to you spending tens of millions of years to comprehend.Imperial venerable Kang Han was a little embarrassed as he said,"I don't think so ... Of course, if you join the other force, there will be. It is said that some seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns will also give lectures regularly in the world ..."But for outsiders, that was fine.Li Hao nodded in understanding.After chatting for a while, he asked about the general situation, but he obviously didn't know the details.After a while, the experts returned."I found a place with no one around to settle down temporarily. With the Nirvana world covering it, it's not too conspicuous ..." The Thunderbolt master said."This place is quite rich in Primal Chaos energy, but there's actually no one living here. There's no world here. The outer reaches of Primal Chaos sure are extravagant ..."Thinking about himself, he was really miserable.The Thunder World had been sealed off for many years, and the surrounding Primal Chaos energy had all been sucked dry by the Dragon Lord and the others. Most people didn't care about the primal Chaos energy, but he was actually very concerned about it. The place he had just chosen was actually very good.Primal Chaos energy was extremely thick in the surroundings.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  It was much richer than some places in the four-side domain. Even great worlds had to survive. If they didn't have enough B * stard power, it would be difficult to even convert some great Dao crystals.At this moment, Kang Han's expression changed slightly. He said in a low voice,""Senior ... Senior may have placed the world in the upper realm! The chaos is divided into nine levels, and there are not many in the upper realm. The nine Heavens are occupied by some eighth-order worlds ... But ordinary eighth-order worlds do not dare to go to the nine Heavens and compete with the other eighth-order worlds ... Therefore, the upper realm occupies a large area ... It does not allow ordinary worlds to establish themselves ..."

As she said that, she seemed to have thought of something and felt a little more at ease."But senior, you're also from a major world, so there's no problem. But it's best ... It's best if you can negotiate with the nearby major worlds to avoid any conflicts."He had almost forgotten that these people were also advanced venerable sovereigns. This world was also a big world.Thunderlord laughed,"upper realm? There was such a division? I've actually met some people from the outer region, and none of them are good people. When I was sealed, some of these guys transmigrated here to trade with our Thunder World ... They're very black-hearted!"Speaking of this, he was full of dissatisfaction.Kang Han was embarrassed and did not say a word.He was under too much pressure when facing these experts.The Thunderbolt master ignored him. He looked at Li Hao and said,""Then we'll just stay here for the time being?"Li Hao nodded slightly."Let's stay here for a while and see what's going on. No matter where we move to, we should focus on strengthening ourselves. Let's see if we can find a place to trade and deal with the miscellaneous items we have on hand."What junk?The corpses of experts, some broken monarch weapons, and many Dao accumulation crystals ...As long as these things could be dealt with, they could be dealt with in batches.It would be best if he could exchange it for something useful to him.For example, the source of some great DAOs or complete small and medium-sized worlds could derive a Dao net, which was more powerful than pure energy. Although Li Hao lacked energy, he was even more lacking in the direction of enlightenment. Now that the Qianjie was full, he was trying to open new ones. If he didn 't, with the Queen's speed and the chaotic energy she was providing, he would die from overeating."Are we still going to the Gemini world?"The Thunderbolt master asked, somewhat eager to give it a try.He wasn't interested in looking for trouble with those he wasn't familiar with, but twin worlds, Scarlet sun's group, neo martial's enemy, Wu Shan's battle, neo martial's and silver moon's group ... It was a level eight world, after all. Should he go and fight?He, who had just entered level 8, was eager to try. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  He hadn't really fought with an eighth-rank!Li Hao was speechless.This Thunderbolt master is also a battle maniac?"Let's wait for a while. We don't know the specific situation in the outer region yet ..."After saying this, Li Hao was silent for a while.""I'd like to go to the South to take a look,"In the South, the spring Autumn Emperor!"Great demon, level eight, probably at the peak of level eight. It's incomparably powerful, an unparalleled Overlord, skilled in time ..." Ever since he heard these words, he was somewhat tempted.He had always been the only one cultivating in time. But now, there seemed to be a second one.In addition, there was the five elements realm in the North, an eighth-rank world with five eighth-rank venerable sovereigns. For Li Hao, the five elements Arts were also what he was good at and proficient in, and so was his teacher.Perhaps, he could go and take a look.Even in the East, in the world of reincarnation, the reincarnation monarch referred to the reincarnation of life and death. Could it be that he was a monarch who was proficient in the Dao of life and death?There are so many interesting places to go, why go to the Twin worlds?In the square region, several rank eights were also good at a unique Dao. However, the desire of the red moon, the light of the radiance Supreme Emperor, and the Scarlet sun Supreme Emperor's Scarlet yang Dao ... Were not too special.The red moon's desire was barely acceptable. However, Li Hao thought that the red moon Emperor's understanding of desire was not as complicated as the way of emotions.He had cultivated life and death, the five elements, and time ...In this place, powerful existences seemed to be everywhere. For Li Hao, if these people were willing to communicate with him, they would definitely be of great help to him. Of course, if they were really willing to communicate, he would not hide anything. Li Hao believed that he was quite knowledgeable.Although he only had a rough understanding of the Dao of calamity, the Dao of time, and the Dao of space, it was still acceptable. There should not be any obstacles in communicating with a rank 8."The South?"The Thunderbolt master was a little surprised, and Li Hao gave a simple explanation.The Thunderbolt master was startled."Time?"Was that even possible?At this moment, second cat was also stunned. He looked at Kang Han."You said that the Overlord of the South cultivates the Dao of time?"Kang Han was very nervous. Did this cat ... Eat people?He said nervously,"I ... I've only heard of it. It's too far away, and ... The other party is a top-notch existence. We've barely had any contact with him. I've only heard some experts mention it ... That Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn can reverse time and extract lifespan. With a cry, an entire world was reduced to bones ... The entire world was destroyed!"Li Hao listened and nodded slightly. He did feel a little like Shi Guang.However ... It was not easy to turn an entire world into bones.Second cat wasn't as calm as Li Hao. He said in disbelief,""Impossible. I don't believe that anyone can cultivate time. No, it's a demon ... It's impossible!"It believed that a teacher's battle strength was not unparalleled, but his wisdom, knowledge, and talent were unparalleled.How could anyone else cultivate the way of time?Even though Li Hao was a genius in second cat's eyes, Li Hao had seen a lot of things and even saw other ninth-rank DAOs. Yet, he still hadn't figured out how time was constructed. Could anyone else do it?"The world is big and there are countless geniuses. Senior second cat...I think nothing is impossible."Li Hao said.

Second cat was silent. It was impossible. I just didn't believe it."If you're going to the South ... You can take me with you," he said after a long time.It also wanted to go.The Thunderbolt master, on the other hand, had a headache. He could not help but say,""The Overlord of the South ... The two level eights of the Twin universes seem to be ordinary here. The five five-element Supreme emperors are all level eights, and even peak level eights can only be considered overlords ... This one is alone, but he's the Overlord of a region. He's definitely extremely powerful, perhaps even more powerful than the Dragon Master ..."Are you sure you want to go?This ... Wasn't this just asking for trouble?What were these people thinking?In the Twin universes right before us, a level eight has died, and no one knows about it yet. Where are we going? with me, Wu Shan, and Li Hao, there's nothing to be afraid of!But ... It was very dangerous to go and find the Overlord of the South.Then why not stay in the four-sided domain and fight with the Dragon Master?Li Hao exhaled."Let's wait and see. Let's understand the situation first."He definitely had to go.He was really interested!As for the danger ... It didn't matter. It was dangerous everywhere he went. He wouldn't be satisfied if he didn't go and take a look.Seeing this, the Thunderbolt master did not try to persuade him any further. He only felt a little helpless.He didn't quite understand what this guy was thinking.There are many ways to comprehend the great Dao, so there's no need to take such a risk. It's better for us to take it step by step.At this moment, Kang Han was already extremely frightened.He felt like he was going to be killed!These people were so arrogant. One wanted to fight the Twin universes, and the other wanted to go to the South to see the Dao of the southern Overlord ...Could this group of people be grade 8?It was very possible. Otherwise, where did he get such confidence from?Was the four-sided region's inner scroll so deep? Even a level eight venerable sovereign had been driven out?……At the same time.Within the lightning territory.At this moment, there was one more person in the lightning territory. He was still carrying a large blade and was strolling around the lightning territory as if there was no one else around.He had a bright smile on his face.However ... He soon became puzzled and looked in a direction. Amidst the lightning, the iron-eating Supreme Emperor, whose body was in tatters, could not find Li Hao and the others. In fact, the iron-eating Supreme Emperor had wanted to look for them, but unfortunately, he had not met them.He didn't really want to go to the outer area, but he couldn't return to the square area either. Here, he was struck by lightning every day, and he was about to die.He was considering whether he should go to the outer region or he would really be struck to death.At this moment, he suddenly felt a powerful saber intent. The iron-eating Thearch was extremely afraid and looked over. His eyes blurred, and a person appeared in front of him.The iron eater Thearch's expression changed drastically!As for the human King, he sized him up and laughed,""Iron-eating?""You ..."The iron eater Thearch's expression changed. After a long time, he said in a low voice,""Human King?""Eh, you know me?"The human King laughed."We've never met before. You have a special look, so I recognized you at first glance. How do you know me?" Is it because I'm too handsome?"“……”The iron-eating Emperor was both fearful and speechless. You ... You are a human King?Really?Who greeted him like that?And why are you here? "Human King ... Why is he here?" he asked in a low voice, out of fear."Oh, I can't stay in the four-sided region anymore. The Dragon Lord wants to drive me away. I have no choice!"He sighed and said,"the Dragon Lord gave me three great worlds of the demon race. I think they are yours. Bull, fire Dolphin, Iron Eagle ... It's just three great worlds, right? then, he drove me...I was short of money, so I had to run away. You don't mind, do you?"The iron eater Thearch was a little annoyed, but he quickly calmed down. Those three traitors ... Were good!"It has nothing to do with me...I don't mind!" He said in a low voice.The human King smiled and nodded,"that's good!" By the way, why are you still here? aren't you going out? Aren't you afraid of being struck to death here?"The iron eater Thearch fell silent.The human King still looked at him curiously and smiled.""Are you a giant panda? There are also giant pandas in my hometown. They're very cute ..."The iron eater Thearch's expression changed slightly and he said in a low voice,""Human King must be joking. We, the iron-eating race, are not the same race as those who only know how to eat, drink, and sleep ..."Alright, barely.In fact, they all had some common bloodline power. However, those guys were completely useless and had degenerated a long time ago. He did not want to be mentioned in the same breath as them."Eh, it seems like you know and have seen it before?"The human King laughed and bared his teeth,"this time, I feel a little closer to you. Do you want to go out and have fun together?" The next time I come back, I'll kill the Dragon Lord with one strike, and you'll let me ride you for a round, how about it?"“……”The iron-eating Thearch was furious!This guy was indeed as the rumors said, extremely Savage and arrogant. He actually ... Actually wanted to ride him!Bastard!The human King laughed again."You look very cute when you're angry. You're even more fun than my big cat. The big cat is almost never angry unless its fish is stolen. When you're angry, your eyes will turn dark ..."The iron eater Thearch almost exploded in anger. If he didn't know that he couldn't defeat the other party, he would definitely fight to the death!The next moment, the human King chuckled and said,""Forget it, I'll stop joking. Are you going or not? If I go out and see Li Hao, I'll bring you there. I don't want to bring a burden with me. Didn't you work with Li Hao last time? That's good. That kid has a strong Army now and has a great enmity with the Dragon Lord. If you go, you might be able to help ..."The iron-eating Supreme Emperor was silent for a moment. He had actually considered this and wanted to find Li Hao. After all, Li Hao had killed a large number of Level Seven Supreme emperors of the chaos race, which was why they had a common enemy.However ... He hesitated for a moment and said,""In the outer region, I made a great enemy of some experts a long time ago ...""Strong? How strong is he?""It's said that there are several rank eights behind him ...""Oh!"The human King didn't mind and laughed,"bullying a giant panda?" It's fine. I'm going out this time to have some fun. Tell me, which one is it? It's fine if you don't want to find trouble, but finding trouble ... Hehe, I don't do nameless fights. I won't go find Li Hao. Just tell me who you have a grudge against. Let's go find trouble and fight! I have a good reason to do so ... This is more in line with my personality!"“……”The iron-eating Emperor thought that he was joking, but ... The human King wasn't joking at all.After a long time, the iron eater Thearch was a little shaken. He looked at the human King and said,""I think it's called the reincarnation realm. It's said that ... There are several rank eight existences, and the realm Lord is a top rank eight expert ... Of course, I didn't look for trouble. It was their people who killed two of my brothers ..."The human King laughed and bared his teeth."That's even better ... Cough, cough. I didn't mean it that way. My condolences!" What I meant was that the other party was so despicable. We are all from the same family, and we are all cultivators from the four regions. If he dared to kill your brother, then he is killing my brother ... Reincarnation, right? Alright, let's go find trouble with him and send him into the cycle of reincarnation!"“……”The iron eater Thearch was completely speechless. 'You ... Do you understand?'It wasn't just one level 8 ... It could be several!Furthermore, he was very strong!He didn't dare to go out rashly because he was worried that he would be killed if he met the other party.

3365 Chapter 546
At this moment, Li Hao still didn't know that the iron-eating Supreme Emperor, who had originally planned to join him, had been intercepted halfway.Of course, it didn't matter even if he knew.To avoid trouble!In fact, he didn't like to get into trouble ... Trouble always came to him. It was all neo martial who caused trouble, and he just took the blame behind them. Just look at Red Moon.Of course, he was the one who had caused trouble when he attacked the Dragon field ... But neo martial was okay and didn't take the blame for him.Li Hao felt that the human King was too arrogant and barbaric ... As for himself, an honest man, he had never liked to cause trouble.At this moment, Li Hao was not in the mood to think about the demons.He had never had much patience or sympathy for people he was not familiar with.Sen LAN, Kong Ji, and the Thunderlord were all refined and didn't cause much trouble. Li Hao didn't like troublemakers, and only the human Emperor liked them.Of course, as for Wushan breaking away from the clouds, the lightning Lord attacking the Dragon Lord, and the solitary void daring to do anything ... This didn't conflict with being refined.That was what Li Hao thought.He had always felt that the people around him were all refined. This included second cat, who was friendlier than the big cat, Black Panther more obedient than the heavenly dog, and the two Dao Masters were not as calculative as the Supreme martial artist ...In comparison, Li Hao found that his group was truly honest, refined, and well-mannered, which was rare in the chaos.The reason why he had such a thought and such a comparison was not without reason.In the Thunder World. Li Hao looked into the distance, as if he had sensed something. At this moment, he unconsciously thought of someone. He kept looking into the distance until Kong Ji called him. Li Hao sighed softly."The outer reaches won't be peaceful anymore.""You're going to do something big?"Kong Ji was excited.“……”Li Hao was helpless. What did it have to do with him?I've never been a person who finds trouble.I've always been kind to others. Brother kongji, do you have some misunderstandings about me?"It has nothing to do with me!"Li Hao was speechless."I seem to have sensed a faint aura of a human King ...""How is that possible?"Kong Ji didn't believe it.There were two things he didn't believe. First, he didn't believe that he could sense the human King. Second, he didn't believe that the human King would appear in the outer region at this moment.He was still in the world of light, guarding the light.What a good person!Li Hao sighed and glanced at Dali world not far away. After he sealed this world, the Thunder World was extremely huge and uninhabited for a Tier 6 world. This world was directly placed into the Thunder World. At this moment, the Stargate flickered slightly.The Stargate was created by the human King and his group.Now that they had left Sifang region, it was reasonable to say that there shouldn't be any movement since they were very far away. Although the fluctuations were very weak ... Why did it feel like a human King had appeared?Previously, when the human King had approached him, the Stargate had actually trembled slightly, but it was extremely weak and difficult to sense.At this point, Li Hao could sense some of it.Don't tell me that the human King has appeared?If the human King came out ... It might mean that some of his previous speculations were true. Neo martial might have to leave the four-sided domain, and the world of light might be abandoned.It was also possible that the human King would choose to leave after his inner world had advanced ...Of course, whether it would be as he had thought, he was still not sure.Li Hao just felt that ... Meeting someone who was extremely capable of causing trouble was a very difficult thing to do ... He hoped that he wouldn't meet the human king again. Even if he did, he couldn't let anyone know that he and I were on the same side ... Now that the human King and I have come out, we're no longer on the same side.As he thought about this, he said,""Forget it, let's not talk about this. I'm about to go on a long journey ... Are you staying here and continuing to communicate with everyone, or are you leaving with me?""Of course we'll go together!"Kong Ji laughed."I think it's enough to leave the Thunderbolt master alone here. He's an eighth-level venerable sovereign, and he has the local world and the great path universe. As long as he doesn't act rashly, ordinary eighth-level cultivators won't be able to break through ... They'll have to pay a considerable price. So, I think it's safer for the others to go together."Li Hao sighed."I'm going there to gain enlightenment. I'm not going there to fight, kill, and seize territories.""There's no difference,"Kong Ji's attitude was completely different from before. Right now, he felt that Li Hao was just being polite."Who would want to exchange DAOs with you? If he was not willing ... Then he could only fight! "Of course, you Silver Moon martial masters have always had a good reason to do so. However, chaotic realm experts are all extremely arrogant. You, a sixth level venerable sovereign, coming here to exchange pointers is a provocation. You're provoking them, and they'll definitely deal with you ... You have a good reason to do so!"“……”  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  He was speechless!Li Hao smiled bitterly.How could that be?A good exchange ..."Don't worry, I know you. We're all doing this for justice, and we're protecting justice!"Kong Ji knew Li Hao's plan by now. He quickly said,""Didn't I hear that some deserted islands sell slaves? This is trampling on the dignity of cultivators. Let's find a deserted island and fight. There must be experts on the deserted island, and I'm afraid there must be some great world behind them. If we fight the young, the old will come. As we fight ... The outer chaotic domain will all be enemies!""When the time comes, I'll beat up whoever I want. None of them will be innocent!" Kong Ji said confidently.“……”Li Hao looked at him for a long time."You've been following me, not the human King ..." He said."Brother kongji, are you ... Mistaken?"

That was strange!It's said that birds of a feather flock together. My side is all refined. Before Kong Ji was refined, he couldn't be refined. Why ... Has he changed?Kong Ji looked at him and kept silent for a while. Then, he said,"Brother Hao Yue, the human King appears to be wild, arrogant, and unscrupulous on the surface, but in reality, he's cautious, responsible, and down-to-earth,"Li Hao looked at him. And then?"As for brother Hao Yue ... You only look harmless on the surface ..."At this point, Kong Ji was silent for a while, as if he was struggling to say it. In the end, he muttered,""Brother Hao Yue, think about it. So many Level 7 and level 8 experts have died in the four regions ... Who killed the most?"“……”Li Hao looked at him in silence. Are you talking about me?I was forced to retaliate.Seeing Li Hao's refusal to admit it, Kong Ji felt helpless. Alright, we've known each other for a few years. Ever since Li Hao left Silver Moon, they've known each other and have been working together.Who was Li Hao?It was said in the square region that the human King was arrogant and despotic, but he wasn't that ruthless. He would only be ruthless to those who had offended him.Where's Li Hao?Of all those who had offended him, only red Moon master was still alive. As for the Dragon Lord, it was Li Hao who attacked the Dragon field first. In fact, Red Moon master was the only one who was still alive in the entire square region.In fact, there were not many previous battles in the four-sided domain. The human King had only destroyed bliss and darkness. The destruction of the remaining great worlds was almost all related to Li Hao, including the destruction of red sun and cloudy sky ... It seemed to be fine, but as long as the Crimson Moon world was not destroyed, there would be no neo martial artists to show their power.It was said that dogs that bite don't bark.Just look at his pets. Neo martial's people, cats, and dogs were all ostentatious on the surface. On Li Hao's side, whether it was people, cats, or dogs ... They all really felt like they bit without barking.This person and the human King could be said to be two extremes.Li Hao touched his chin and looked at Kong Ji with a "you know too much" look, which made Kong Ji feel helpless.Li Hao chuckled."Alright, brother emptiness, stop talking. After leaving tianfang, you've become more and more fond of joking."“……”Kong Ji shrugged and didn't say anything else.Li Hao was very polite to everyone. He always called them seniors and fellow Daoists, but when he attacked, he would not show any mercy."So, where are we going next?" he asked directly."There are many worlds in the chaos. I want to go to the South the most, but ... It's far. Secondly, the South is the territory of the demon race. It's not convenient to go there. Plus, we don't know much about the chaos. We'll take one step at a time. This place is the closest to the Twin universes. We'll go and take a look first, then see the other worlds in the East, including Samsara ..."First, he would take a look at the experts of the East and see how strong the overlords of the East were.If he wanted to go out and ask, he had to have the strength.In this day and age, people would die if they went out to ask around without some strength.It was too dangerous!On the path of seeking Dao, the future is bumpy. I will search from top to bottom. If I can't seek the Dao or ask the Dao, I can only use some ungentleman means. "Alright!"Kong Ji agreed and called out,"Seniors, fellow Daoist Hao Yue is about to leave!"Whoosh! Whoosh!In an instant, cultivators teleported over one by one.“……”Li Hao was speechless. Why were they so excited?"I'm just going out to take a look. I'm really just going out to take a look. If I can ask, I'll ask. If I can 't, I'll just ask somewhere else. "It was equivalent to wandering the primordial chaos and the world.The Thunder World was a rank eight great world. At the moment, it was a place with dense chaotic force. It was very comfortable here. Everyone was so enthusiastic."This time, I won't be bringing any ordinary people with me. Everyone needs some time to settle down.""Senior second cat, please come with me. Brother emptiness is going too ..." Li Hao said after some thought.He looked at the others, Wu Shan, Dao Qi, and the Thunderlord. After some thought, he said,"Senior Wushan, do you want to go out and take a look, or ..." "Get out!"Wu Shan instantly replied.Seeing that Li Hao was looking at him, he coughed and said awkwardly,""I'm mainly worried about your safety. This is the outer region, and there are many type 8 powerhouses. Although you guys aren't weak, it'll be troublesome if you encounter a type 8 powerhouse here ..."Alright, there was no need to say anything more.He then looked at Dao Qi, who was slightly resentful."Level eight world ... You still owe me one, so of course I have to go. Otherwise, what if you forget?"Alright, there was no need to ask about this.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"then this time, it'll be me, Kong Ji, Wu Shan, ermao, Dao Qi ...""And the Black Panther and the Queen," he added after a pause.Some people nearby moved slightly, but they didn't say anything.Qian Wuliang and the others had followed him to the great li realm, but it was still sealed. However, there were still many people who hadn't entered the sealed great li realm. For example, Hong Yitang, Yuan Shuo, and Nan Quan didn't enter ...He didn't bring anyone. It was fine to bring the Black Panther, but what the hell was the Queen doing?Of course, that was just what the southern Fist and the others were thinking.At this moment, Yuan Shuo was thinking that nothing good would come out of this grandson's departure. Look, the Queen had brought him along. What was he doing?It was for recruiting people!Who?The humans of this world!  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Obviously, they were preparing for something big. It was normal to destroy a realm. Otherwise, almost all the people who went out this time were experts. Black Panther was the weakest, but he had also stepped into level six yesterday.

The Queen was only a 4th rank, the unstable kind, what was the use of bringing her along?Its only use was to recruit people! As for Black Panther, if he left Silver Moon here, he could bring an entire world with him, or even a second cat ...This team was obviously prepared to seize the realm and kill people.Li Hao didn't explain anything. He said,""By the way, a few days ago, we invited Daoist Kang Han to be our guide. We're not familiar with the outer reaches of the chaos. Although he's not strong, he's still a fourth level venerable sovereign. He should be able to lead the way ...""Then, Sen LAN and I ..." The Thunderbolt master could not help but say.Li Hao looked at the two of them and said,"both of you need to guard your great worlds, and it's not convenient for you to carry them around. Moreover, Senlan has just entered Level Seven, and Thunder World has just entered level eight. You two can stay here. It'll be safer for you to look at and protect each other."As for the Senlan realmlord, he didn't really care about it. Recently, he had many things to do. His world had just advanced to the 7th level not long ago and the number of venerable sovereigns under his command was even more than the Thunder World. Previously, he had also absorbed many people from the four worlds. Right now, he was busy dealing with these matters.He was very busy!As for the Thunder Emperor, he really wasn't too busy. The main reason was that there were not many people in the Thunder World. There were less than 20 venerable sovereigns. In addition, he had been trapped in the Dragon field for too long, so he wanted to have some fun.But Li Hao didn't want to take him there.Of course, an eighth rank venerable sovereign could leave as he pleased ... But if he were to leave, there would really be no one left to guard the Thunder World.Thunderlord was somewhat regretful!Li Hao was a little surprised. He didn't expect the Thunderbolt master to want to go out and have fun.This time, there were not many people with him.Including Li Hao and the outsider Kang Han, there were only seven people.One at the eighth step, including Li Hao, four at the seventh step, one at the sixth step, and two at the fourth step.This kind of line-up ... Without even considering the world's support, they could take down an eighth-ranked world, provided that Wu Shan could deal with an eighth-ranked Lord.……When Kang Han was brought out, he was on the verge of tears.He felt that he was about to be executed.When Li Hao gently invited him to be his guide, he almost cried. 'Don't I have to die?'How blissful!In the past few days, he had figured out some things. For example, among this group of people, this person seemed to only be at the sixth step ... Yes, he now knew that this cultivator who called himself Li Hao only had the strength of the sixth step.However, a sixth stage venerable sovereign was the leader of this group.And there were two level 8 experts in this group!Furthermore, there were many Grade 7 experts!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  But these people all heard that it was a level six ... It was simply unbelievable and inexplicable. It even made Kang Han suspect that Li Hao's father might be the master of Tian Fang.Otherwise, how could it be like this?Even if it was the master of Tian Fang, he had disappeared for too long. Even if he was not dead, he was still a rank eight venerable sovereign. They were not even from the same world. There was no need to listen to him, right?Of course, Kang Han was not in the mood to think about this at this moment. He thought he was dead for sure, but now that he didn't have to die, he was very happy."Senior ...""There's no need to call me senior,"Li Hao laughed."It's not good to be too formal when we're outside. You can just call me Haoyue. If you can 't, you can also call me fellow Daoist li. We'll have to rely on fellow Daoist Kang Han's help for this trip. We're unfamiliar with the people and the place, and we don't know much about the outer region ... I hope fellow Daoist can give us some pointers."“……”Kang Han laughed bitterly. In this day and age, with strength, was there a need to be afraid of unfamiliarity?"I'll definitely try my best ..."Kang Han said carefully,"Se ... Fellow Daoist li, where are you planning to go on this trip?""Let's go take a look at the twins first!"Li Hao thought for a moment. Although he didn't really want to go, it wasn't too difficult for him to go to the level 8 world right at his doorstep.Good fellow!Kang Han was speechless. The first one he had to go to was an eighth-tier twin universe?This ... Wouldn't start a fight, right?At this moment, in his eyes, the people from the four-sided zone were all fanatical and barbarian.But ... He had no choice since the other party wanted him to lead the way.……The group of people set off without any hesitation.To the others, this was the first time they had left the four-sided domain. Everywhere was unfamiliar, and it was the same no matter where they went. They would at least be more familiar with the Twin universes, because everyone knew this universe.They also knew that the Dragon Lord had killed one of the two eighth-ranked brothers, so it had nothing to do with them.Wu Shan was also an old friend of Supreme Emperor di yang ... After all, both of them had fought once.Thus, on this day, Li Hao and the others set off for twin worlds, while the human King led two rank 7s of the iron-eater race toward reincarnation ... To places with people. The human King didn't know where the reincarnation realm was, nor did he know the specific situation of The Outer Worlds. In any case, he could ask where there were people. Once he got the answer, it would depend on the situation. Should he expose the giant panda and let the experts of the reincarnation realm come to him?One was planning to keep a low profile, while the other was planning to keep a high profile.……At the same time as they left.Someone walked out from the vicinity of the Thunder region.The Grandmaster sighed. He glanced at the big cat beside him, who looked like it was better off dead than alive, and felt a little helpless. 'If Fang ping left, then so be it. What's with that attitude?'I won't let you go because ... The handover takes time.Why are you in such a hurry?That bastard Fang ping had left the world behind and left just like that. He had done it so quickly that he could not believe it.Next to him was the light Thearch. At this moment, he only had four rank seven experts with him. He also looked a little sad. Light was gone. From now on, the divine light world would be a thing of the past.

3368 Chapter 546
Today, there were many powerhouses on his side and on the side of neo martial arts.After leaving the Thunder region and reaching the outer region, it wasn't difficult to gain a foothold there.The Grandmaster looked at the scene outside, and then looked into the distance. After a long time, he slowly said,"Neo martial, it's better to fight steadily. Find a place and make friends with the surrounding realms. In the square region, our reputation has been ruined by Red Moon and Fang ping, so no one dares to make friends with us ... Here, not many people know our situation. Here, we can start over again!"The Supreme martial artist chuckled."It's said that there are three overlords in the outer region of the primal Chaos. Only the East has not produced an Overlord who can suppress an area. They are all fighting on their own ... Since you're out, brother Guang Ming is idle. We can't be too idle ... Right?"The light Thearch raised his eyebrows."It's said that even the Eastern Region of the chaotic outer domain is much larger than the square region. There are only a few rank eight worlds in the square region, but there are many in the Eastern Region ..."The Supreme-being said."Supreme ... Isn't this the first time you're out of the outer region?"The radiance Thearch was slightly surprised. In fact, he had some understanding of the situation in the outer heavenly domain. After all, as the hegemon of the light, he had once hosted some cultivators from the outer heavenly domain in the square domain.However, it was not easy for a new martial Supreme to know this.How did he know?Neo martial didn't seem to have gone out, right?At this moment, the Supreme martial artist smiled and said,"it's still necessary to prepare for a rainy day. The neo martial artists in the square region are almost hated by everyone, and they won't be able to survive. In addition, there are too many neo martial artists and there are no resources to train them ... A few years ago, I let some people leave the square region in advance."“……”The radiance Thearch was speechless.This ...The divine light plane had been established in the four regions for more than a million years, but he had never arranged for anyone to go to the Outlands, because he felt that he would never be able to leave this place in his entire life. But now, this fellow had actually arranged for someone to go out long ago? How many years had it been since the neo martial arts emerged?So impatient?Or did he already expect that neo martial would be hated by everyone in the Sifang region?The Grandmaster didn't say much. It was normal to make arrangements. Even if it was useless, it was good to let people go out and see the world. There was nothing to make a fuss about.……At another place.Four regions.With the departure of new martial, the light disappeared, Silver Moon left, and the monster race was wiped out ...At this moment, the four-sided domain was in constant turmoil. Under the leadership of Black Tiger and red Moon, the two type 8 experts of the chaos race, they intimidated the four directions! According to the Dragon Lord's request, all the rank Seven Worlds had to gather in one area near tianfang world for easy management.The chaos race would not invade the other universes either. They would even ask the level Seven venerable sovereigns of the chaos race to help them move the world.As for the seventh-tier universes, they only needed to offer one-tenth of the great Dao crystals produced by the great Dao universe every year. Other than that, the Dragon Master had no other requirements.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  As for the small and medium worlds, they had to be gathered together for the convenience of management.As for those who didn't want to listen ... They could try. The chaos race had more than 20 Level Seven venerable sovereigns and several level eight venerable sovereigns. Could they attack a universe?Even if they were to rebel together ... How could they really join forces?As the old level-eight universes such as Red Moon, red sun, light, and cloud sky disappeared, the entire square region welcomed the first unification in a million years!Even if the level 7 Masters were unwilling to leave, how many of them would be willing to leave the world behind?The Dragon Lord had actually given him a choice.Why don't you give up the universe and leave the square domain? you can leave while the Thunder region is still peaceful. Even if you devour the world and leave by yourself, no one will care.However, how difficult was it to nurture a rank seven world? how many people would have the courage to give up a universe?If he stayed, he might still have a chance.Furthermore, it would only provide one-tenth of the great Dao crystals born in the great Dao universe. If they gritted their teeth, it would be over. As long as the Dragon Master did not really invade, these people would be able to endure it.……Dragon World.At this moment, the dragon world had also shifted its position and was no longer in the Dragon field. Tian Fang was the center of the square field. At this moment, the dragon world was near Tian Fang.At this moment, Feng Yan was a little confused."The Dragon Lord has gathered all the worlds here. If a large number of seventh-level universe Masters gather here, it will be extremely dangerous if they resist. As far as we know, there are 36 seventh-level universes in the three regions, and 42 seventh-level venerable sovereigns!"It was more than expected. According to expectations, there might only be 20 or so level-seven universes left in the three major regions.In the end, this time, level-seven universes actually appeared in some remote places. No one had discovered them before, or some people knew about them, but they had always been very mysterious. Now, they had all appeared.There were more than 40 tier 7 experts. Most of them were gathered by Dao Lords and world Lords. A small number of them were separated from world Lords. All of them enjoyed the benefits of the world. There were quite a number of tier 7 experts in the chaos race, including the few tier 7 experts from the demon race.But ... It was still very dangerous.The moment these worlds gathered and revolted, it would be terrible.Moreover, only taking one-tenth of the great Dao crystals from these worlds was too little. According to Feng Yan and the others, they would kill a group of people, intimidate a group of people, devour some universes, and the rest would be enslaved and signed a great Dao agreement.

3369 Chapter 546
Becoming slaves like red Moon was the best outcome.At this moment, the Dragon Master looked at tianfang world silently. After a long time, he sighed softly,""You have to understand that this chaos still belongs to the human race at the moment ... Even if we manage to unify the universe in the later stages, the human race will still be the leader ... It doesn't mean that we, the chaos race, can frantically produce descendants just because we occupy the universe."He sighed."In the past, when the Dragon field closed its doors, we were all on the same side. I know what you've done. I didn't mind turning a blind eye. "Today, we can't exploit the human race too much. I know these people very well. As long as we don't exploit them too much, they won't resist. They'll think that if I resist, I'll die and everything will be gone ...""Therefore, to exploit them, one-tenth is already a lot. One-tenth of a universe means that the ten seventh-tier universes are the products of a complete seventh-tier universe. Furthermore, it is a continuous supply ...""This is the first reason! "Second, with our strength, we can't kill them all and then be besieged by the experts from the outer domains ... Their existence is actually the foundation of the square domain. If these people die, it will be a loss of dozens of world Lords to the outer domains. Even if we, the chaos race, can give birth to some, it will be much less. In this way, the outer domains will be tempted.""Third, the humans here are just a portion of the entire chaos. There are many, many humans ... Killing one or two, or one or two worlds, is actually fine. If you exterminate all the humans here ... Such a crazy act will only send us to our deaths. When that happens, even if the human overlords don't care, they'll still attack. They've killed too many!"The Dragon Master shook his head."Don't be rash. The most important thing is ... To obtain status. This is the first!" "Second, open up communication with the outer domains as soon as possible. There are also a large number of chaos beings in the outer domains, more than we have here. We need to trade and exchange with them. We need to use some of the resources and special products of the square domain to exchange for our clansmen from the outer domains!""And the existence of the human race can allow us to better trade with them."After saying that, he added softly,"besides, the celestial Bombari is actually still alive. It's not dead. Last time, Li Hao distributed a bunch of sleeping stars to a group of people. Many of them have them ... Now, dozens of major worlds have gathered here. Countless sleeping universes have covered, nurtured, and even activated this place ...""It will allow Tian Fang to open faster!"After saying that, he paused and suddenly looked at Tian Fang, sighing,""Tian Fang is a good place, but I'm also worried that if Tian Fang really recovers ..." He said.Would the master of tianfang return?If he returned, that would be a huge problem.Was the master of Tian Fang still alive?There was a high chance that he was still alive.Since that was the case, he was only afraid that Tian Fang would awaken and make this person return. That would be very troublesome.He didn't say anything more and looked at Feng Yan.""You have to reach the eighth rank as soon as possible, but you're still far from it. The eighth rank is very difficult, but it's not that difficult either. The difficulty lies in the ninth rank!" "The path from level eight to level nine is very, very difficult ... I'm afraid you don't have any hope of constructing 10000 DAOs ..."Feng Yan didn't think much of it. Since ancient times, there had only been one level nine in the four regions.If there was no hope, then there was no hope.Seeing that she didn't care, the Dragon Lord shook his head and thought of the fire Phoenix ... It was a pity that the fire Phoenix actually had a high chance of stepping into the eighth rank. Moreover, her talent and aptitude were actually very good. Of course, Feng Yan had been nurtured well by her.But ... He was too young!After all, it was the only one in his bloodline who had stepped into the seventh rank. In addition, the fire Phoenix had died in battle, and the Dragon Lord felt that he had treated the fire Phoenix unfairly. If he had returned quickly after he had died in the longxuan battle ...Even if they were a little more determined and came out earlier, these people would not have died.Therefore, he valued and favored Feng Yan more. At this moment, he said,""Normally, it should be difficult for you to construct a myriad Dao domain. Even if you manage to do it, you'll need countless years to accumulate ... However, there's another method, just like huntian!"He hadn't seen huntian in a long time, but at this moment, he had some judgment. He thought for a moment and said,""Walk the path of great unification! To establish order in the chaos! To turn disorder into order ... If you have nothing to do, you can go to the various realms to take a look. You have to learn some things, such as ... Disguise!"The Dragon Lord said softly,"I don't care whether the human race hates me, fears me, or wants to kill me ... You don't have to be like me. The daughter of a domineering Dragon Lord might ... Have some kind heart and be pure and flawless!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "You can save whoever I want to kill ... If I want to destroy a world, you can ask for mercy ... If I want to suppress it, you can secretly help some humans!"p "Step by step. This includes building some temples in some realms, small realms, and Dragon Ladies and Phoenix ladies. In some mortals, they are actually totems of faith. They don't let you walk the path of faith, but they let you win the hearts of people and build your own Dao domain ..."He had arranged a path for Feng Yan, and he might not be able to go far.It mainly depended on himself.If he was able to unify the primordial chaos ... He wouldn't walk the path of grand unity, but his daughter could.Once he had earned enough status, territory, and resources for the chaos race, his daughter would be able to subjugate the humans and become the creator of the human race. It would actually be very easy. As long as one generation passed away, no one would know about it.
