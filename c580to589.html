f the ruins.
 Since he had promised Yu Xiao, he would do it. He would draw a map for Yu Xiao. As for the origin divine weapon, it was already gone. There was no origin divine weapon ... Li Hao thought for a while and marked a point on the city gate tower. The two words were even more valuable than an origin divine weapon!
 This was a real treasure map. Li Hao wasn't lying.
 As for the red moon's shadow, it was fine to watch.
 Look carefully, go to the city gate tower and take a look at those two words. There might be a surprise. If you meet that murderer and kill your way back from the past ... Just thinking about it is exciting.
 After finishing the drawing, the red shadow still hadn't left.
 It seemed that Hao lianchuan's whereabouts had been monitored by many people. Knowing that Hao lianchuan had not returned, these people were getting bolder and bolder.
 Li Hao ignored the red shadow.
 He continued to practice his fist techniques.
 The punch was quite loud, and it was aimed at the red shadow.
  The red shadow was not afraid of physical attacks, but a Martial master's qi and blood could also hurt the red shadow, let alone the divine decree.
 Li Hao practiced his fist techniques for a while. Seeing that he couldn't beat the red shadow away, he picked up the overbearing sword and began to practice his swordsmanship!
 ……
 At the house of the inspection Division.
 In one of the buildings, an ordinary-looking middle-aged man was making a call. He frowned and said,""He didn't do anything. He came back for dinner, drew, and then began to practice martial arts ... Mainly fist and sword, but his sword intent is quite strong ..."
 He had to give in to Li Hao.
 Going to work, going home, eating, practicing martial arts ...
 Was this still a young man?
 Don't you have any hobbies?
 There were no abnormalities!
 On the other end of the communication.
 Outside the White moon City.
 Zi Yue looked into the city. There was another person beside him, who was also looking into the city with a playful expression. He heard the conversation in the communication and chuckled,""This Li family's descendant ... Is really boring!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Ziyue nodded.  After hanging up the communication, he looked into the city and said in a deep voice,"We don't need to worry about him for now. Hong Yue is being watched by everyone because of the blood God. Hou Xiaochen killed red hair. What do you think we should do next?"
 The man chuckled,"so what if he's dead? hou Xiaochen only needs to kill one. Would he dare to kill a second?" Redhair was too careless and too weak. He was killed by a spear ... He's a disgrace to the Crimson Moon!"
 "The leader has given me two missions!" He said. First, bring back Li Hao, or Li Hao's corpse! The second was to bring back Yuan Shuo or Yuan Shuo's corpse. As for hou Xiaochen, the leader doesn't have many requirements. "
 He looked at Zi Yue and said,"so, hou Xiaochen, who embarrassed you, is not our main target. The real core is Li Hao!" We're different from the others. Li Hao is more important to us than hou Xiaochen. Ziyue, don't get our target wrong!"
 Zi Yue frowned."But ... It's almost impossible to take a living person away. We can only kill Li Hao. Is there any use in killing him?"
 "I don't know."
 LAN Yue said indifferently,"I'll just follow orders. Maybe leader has other ways." Of course, it's best if we can capture Li Hao alive and wait for the next rainy season. The next rainy season will arrive soon, around December. "
 The time interval between Hong Yue's killing of the descendants of the Eight Families was getting shorter and shorter.
 Now, the next rainy season would be in December. It might not even take half a year.
 "Then ... What about heaven battling ancient city?" Zi Yue was still unwilling to give up.
 "I'll enter if I can, it doesn't matter if I can 't. "
 LAN Yue said calmly,"Zi Yue, some of the treasures in your eyes, some of the most valuable treasures, may not be worth mentioning in the eyes of the leader!" The origin divine weapon and divine power Stone were not that important. Red Moon left a lot of power in Silver Moon, but it wasn't for this. From the beginning, our goal was the Eight Families of Silver City, and it hasn't changed for more than ten years. "
 Zi Yue frowned."Then why didn't you imprison Li Hao earlier? at that time, he was just an ordinary person, and had not yet acknowledged Yuan Shuo as his master. You had to go through so much trouble and let him roam free, which led to today's change. Otherwise, Li Hao would have been captured long ago."
  Blue Moon shook his head."You don't understand. It's not that simple! We didn't discover Li Hao's existence until he was 18. We didn't discover him from the very beginning. We only confirmed that he was the core heir of the Li family after he was 18. Before that, even if we confirmed that he was a member of the Li family, it didn't mean much!"
 "When he was 18 years old, he already had a master."
 He continued,"before this, the leader had actually done something to the Li family. His parents died because of him. However, I didn't expect that his father wasn't the core of the Li family's legacy. This is what makes me feel helpless!"
 Then, he added softly,"besides, the time wasn't right. We couldn't take Li Hao away. It wouldn't be a good thing if we did. His bloodline would decline rapidly. His father lost his bloodline probably because we attacked outside the city."
 Ziyue listened for a while but didn't say anything. She didn't participate in this.
 In fact, she had not known about Hong Yue's actions against the eight great families for long. Before this, she had been an outsider; after all, she had not inherited Zi Yue's identity for long.
 But now, it seemed that the leader had given up on capturing Li Hao alive. He had even given the order to bring back his body. She didn't know if there were any changes.
 "Blue Moon, eight great families, what do they represent?"
 "Don't ask!"
 LAN Yue said indifferently,"even I'm not too sure, but I won't ask. It's not a good thing to ask too much. It's also not a good thing to know too much!" What we need to do is simple. Bring Li Hao back!"

 "Then, when do we make our move?"
 "Hou Xiaochen is too strong," Zi Yue said in a low voice. "Even you might not be his match."
 "During chaos!"
 Ziyue fell into deep thought. When would the chaos start?
 "Soon!"
 LAN Yue laughed."The Nightwalker headquarters sent people. They're just a bunch of ignorant kids. All they think about is making contributions, quelling the rebellion, and taking down hou Xiaochen ... These guys are our real help."
 "Hu Qingfeng?"
 "He's also a rising light, but he's not even as strong as red-haired,"Zi Yue frowned," where did he get the courage to provoke hou Xiaochen?"
 Was he crazy?
 "He's not crazy. Not only is he not crazy, he's very clear-headed!"
  "He can't take down hou Xiaochen, but ... Isn't there someone who's willing to help him?" LAN Yue laughed. For example ... Me! For example, the king of equality! For example, Banshan!"
 LAN Yue smiled brightly,"hou Xiaochen is a nail in the coffin, so I'll agree!" "Of course, that's not important. I just need him to take action. As long as he takes action and disrupts hou Xiaochen, I'll go and take Li Hao down ... No, perhaps you're more suitable. I don't mind fighting hou Xiaochen and seeing how strong he is."
 "If 4 sunguangs aren't enough, you can add more!"
 LAN Yue laughed."A lot of people in the central continent want to see where hou Xiaochen's bottom line is. Even if we can't take him down this time, we'll just send five, six ... Until everyone makes a move and still can't take him down ... Then we'll wait for even stronger existences to come!"
 Zi Yue took a deep breath. These people actually wanted to join forces.
 This was also something she had never considered before, because she felt that joining forces might not be a good thing.
 "LAN Yue, tell me the truth. Are you not the only one here?"
 Ziyue asked.
 LAN Yue turned to look at her and frowned slightly.""Ziyue, it's not a good thing to know more!"
 Ziyue was a little unhappy but she did not ask further.
 In his heart, he was thinking, would the elders Guild or anyone else come in the middle of July?
 Knowing how powerful hou Xiaochen was, it was impossible for him not to make any preparations.
 Even though LAN Yue was powerful, she didn't think she could match up to hou Xiaochen. She still couldn't forget how powerful and domineering he had been when he had killed the red-haired man with a single strike.
 ……
 The red shadow in the room was almost broken by Li Hao.
 The red shadow only disappeared when Hao lianchuan returned. Li Hao didn't go out to see Hao lianchuan, as he was sick of him.
 As soon as the red shadow left, Li Hao began to suppress the Tiger in his heart.
 Tiger head sword!
 He wanted to try and see if he could compress this Tiger into the fire Tiger sword before tomorrow night!
 That night, Li Hao didn't sleep again.
 He had been trying to compress it, but the Tiger was very stubborn. Even if it was almost deformed, it was unwilling to turn into a sword. This gave Li Hao a headache. Shi couldn't be too messy.  With a sword, a Tiger, and a mountain, it wasn't good to display one's full potential. Although it was more versatile, it often meant mediocrity.
 Yuan Shuo was an all-rounder, and even though his teacher wasn't mediocre, in terms of offensive prowess, his teacher didn't have much of an advantage.
 Li Hao tried for a long time that night.
 He had compressed the Tiger a lot, but the sword shape had never been revealed.
 It was only compressed into an even smaller Tiger.
 ……
 In the blink of an eye, it was September 6th.
 In the morning, Li Hao went to work on time as usual. With Hao lianchuan, there were fewer demons and ghosts on the way.
 This was his third day in the White moon City.
 In the car.
 Hao lianchuan glanced at Li Hao, who had his eyes closed. He felt that this kid was different from two days ago.
 "Li Hao ..."
 "Yes."
 "Be careful ... Tonight!" He warned.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I know."
 Li Hao nodded.
 "How long do you need, Minister?"
 "The latest is 30 seconds. If we're fast, it'll be 10 seconds!"
 Then, he said in a deep voice,"you have to make sure that you have at least 30 seconds to protect yourself. Otherwise ... I'll give up on this idea. Actually, it doesn't matter if I kill you or not. I just want to vent my anger. There's no need to do it."
 It wasn't too fast.
  When a powerhouse made a move, 10 seconds might be enough to end a battle.
 Hao lianchuan was only at the initial stage of the three yang realm ... But now he seemed to have reached the middle stage. His speed was not so fast, and with the help of the fiery phoenix spear, he might have reached the same level. However, the time he took was still a little too long.
 "That won't do,"
 Li Hao smiled."I've already arranged everything. If I don't do it, I'm afraid I'll get into trouble."
 "You ... Then you should think about it carefully. Otherwise, if something really happens to you, your master won't let me off!"
 Hao lianchuan suddenly felt a little regretful. Although he knew that this kid was brave and had some brains, he suddenly remembered that his master was Yuan Shuo.
 If something really happened to Li Hao, even if hou Xiaochen didn't pursue the matter, Yuan Shuo would.
 He regretted it a little. If he had known, he wouldn't have done such a thing.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was very calm.
 He looked out of the window and let out a breath. He really hoped ... That he could strike once today. One strike was good. The Tiger head sword was eager to strike. Perhaps, once he struck once, it would be willing to become a sword!

 South City.
 At the night patrollers 'headquarters.
 A quiet day once again opened. The entire white moon City had been very quiet for the past few days. Other than a few small problems, nothing major had happened. There were no disputes in the sunlit city.
 Hou Xiaochen still hadn't appeared, but the other factions didn't seem to be in too much of a hurry. They were slowly waiting for him to appear.
 He had never heard of anyone rushing to do anything just because he was injured.
 Wang Ming had also arrived early in the morning, but he had only come to check in, make an attendance call, and visit Li Hao on the way. He wasn't in the mood to stay for long.
 ……
 After entering Li Hao's office and walking around, Wang Ming was a little speechless and envious.
 "I'm so good to you!"
 They were even assigned to an office.
  It was a pity that he was next door to chief Yu, so Wang Ming spoke a little softer. Otherwise, he would have also wanted to experience what it felt like to work in this office. Having an office in the night patrollers 'headquarters was often a symbol of status.
 Li Hao smiled but didn't say anything. At this moment, he was polishing his sword.
 The earth overturning sword was still very handy to use now.
 Wang Ming had said something the day before yesterday, so he naturally knew that something might happen. Seeing Li Hao wiping his sword, he seemed to realize something and winked at Li Hao, as if he was tempted.
 ,m Li Hao raised his head, glanced at him, and smiled.  After some consideration, Li Hao said,""I'll get off work at 6 p.m. Until I get home at about 6:30 p.m. At this time, help me do something."
 Wang Ming had known that Li Hao would send him a message, so he was not surprised.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, he was so excited that he quickly nodded his head. He couldn't wait to be part of this.
 "There are seven surveillance cameras along the way from the night patrollers 'headquarters to the house of the inspector. I need all seven cameras to stop working for half an hour without anyone noticing. Can you do that?"
 Wang Ming instantly frowned.
 He thought for a moment and said in a low voice,""This is the job of the inspector. I ... I can't do it."
 He had a headache.
 After some thought, he said,"moreover, maintaining it for half an hour is very difficult ..."
 At this point, he thought for a moment and said,"I know what you mean. Once I make a move, it will probably be within a certain range, and it will probably only last for a while. This way, as long as I hear or feel any movement ... I will barge into the monitoring room immediately and knock out the person guarding it. I will then take away and destroy everything. What do you think? No one will care after that. "
 "You know where it is?"
 Li Hao looked at him. Wang Ming grinned and immediately nodded.
 Of course he knew!
 "We used to race a lot," he whispered."We were warned before. We knew where it was later."
 This was just a small matter, and he wanted to participate in more. He said excitedly,""Is there anything else?"
 Seeing his excitement, Li Hao thought for a while and nodded.""Help me buy dinner. I'll eat it when I get back."
 “……”
 Wang Ming looked at him for a long time, speechless. His face darkened and he stopped talking.
 Was he even speaking the human language?  Li Hao laughed and ignored him.
 Sunlight was really not enough now.
 Although this fellow wasn't weak, it wasn't just a few dark moons who wanted to deal with him now.
 ……
 Time slowly passed.
 Everyone was acting normal.
 Li Hao continued with his daily routine of practicing martial arts, fist techniques, and sword techniques.
 Beside him, Chief Steward Yu sensed the commotion next door and was speechless. This was the first time she had seen such a silent and bored person like Li Hao. There was no lack of such people among the night patrols, but they were usually old people.
 He was a young man. It was unknown if he had just arrived and was not used to it, or if he had always been like this.
 It was said that he was also like this in Silver City.
 Such a person was actually very boring.
 Although hou Xiaochen rarely spoke, in chief Yu's eyes, it was his bearing. Li Hao was so boring that he must be really bored.
 ……
 East City.
 At the hotel.
 The five supers from above were not all in the hotel. Hu Qingfeng went to the administration Bureau, and some went to the Silver Moon Army.
 Only two people were left in the spacious suite.
 One of them was Yu Xiao, and the other was a golden-haired man in his thirties.
 At this moment, the two of them were drinking and chatting.
 Yu Xiao looked at the clock on the wall. It was 5: 50,10 minutes before Li Hao got off work.
 That guy was a standard worker.
 He would get off work at 6 O' clock, so he would definitely not stay for long.
  "Old Huang, this wine doesn't smell good ... I smelled the fragrance of wine when I went out yesterday. It's very fragrant. I'll go buy some back and let's continue drinking. This damn place is so boring. If I don't drink some, I won't be able to sleep at night."
 The golden-haired man called old Huang laughed."You can just get someone to buy it. Do you need to go there yourself?"
 How big of a deal!
 "I'll go. I can't remember the specific place, but I remember the place. It's not far. Wait for me, I'll be back soon. "
 Yu Xiao was about to leave when old yellow laughed,""Why don't I go with you? I have nothing to do anyway."
 How could that be!
 Yu Xiao didn't want to be with this guy. Old yellow was even stronger than him, an existence at the peak of three yang. In this group of five, Hu Qingfeng was the strongest, the other two were at the peak of three yang, and a woman was at the late stage of three yang. Yu Xiao was the weakest.
 Even if old Huang was gone, there was still his business?
 "No need!"
 Yu Xiao waved his hand."You wait here. Boss Hu and the others might come back soon. When they see that we're not here, they'll definitely be angry."

 "That's fine,"
 Old yellow didn't force him, but reminded him,""If you want to buy wine, then buy wine. Don't cause trouble!"
 "How could I!"
 Yu Xiao laughed out loud, but old yellow reminded him,""I'm serious. It's not like no one knows that you have a fetish. If you want to do this kind of thing, you just need to spend some money, and many women will come to you themselves. Don't mess around halfway ... This is not a chaotic area. There's a God in the city!"
 Yu Xiao, this fellow, did have some bad hobbies.
 For example ... He could sneak into the homes of some women and do something ...
 It had happened before. The night patrolman was not that bad. It was just that this guy usually did not dare to do it in front of people. In some chaotic areas, it was very chaotic. Wars often broke out. This guy had done it a few times in these places. Old yellow knew it clearly.
 However, Yu Xiao wasn't weak, and he had a good relationship with him, so he turned a blind eye and didn't report it. After all, in a chaotic area, there was always a day and a day. Superpowers were mixed and it was very chaotic. No one knew who did this.
 "Old Huang, how could I?!" Yu Xiao hurriedly replied. Do you think I'm stupid? This is Silver Moon, not a chaotic area!"
 "Well, as long as you know what you're doing!"
  Old yellow didn't say anything more. Yu Xiao smiled and didn't say anything more. He got up and left.
 After he left, old yellow frowned slightly.
 This guy was in a hurry today. He had looked at the clock on the wall more than once. He was in a hurry.
 This was Whitemoon city, the capital of the Silver Moon.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Did sperm get to his brain?
 He was a little worried and had a headache. This kind of thing could be big or small, but once it was exposed, the night patrolmen were still righteous and orderly. If Yu Xiao's actions were known, there would definitely be someone to deal with him!
 The few perverts at the headquarters would not mind killing him or castrating him.
 "This guy can't be that stupid, right?"
 Old yellow looked out the window and fell into deep thought.
 ……
 In the blink of an eye, it was Sixo' clock.
 It was time to get off work.
 Chief Steward Yu, who was next door, heard the sound of the door closing, followed by the sound of the door locking. She didn't go out and just listened silently, somewhat speechless.
 How punctual!
 It was more accurate than an alarm clock.
 If he didn't retreat a minute earlier or later, Li Hao would be living like a puppet.
 "I'm off work, see you tomorrow!"
 Outside the door, Li Hao was greeting people with a smile on his face. Another day had passed. He had been doing nothing for a day, and now that he had gotten his salary, he was in a good mood.
 When she reached the top of the stairs, Hao lianchuan happened to come down.
 When he saw Li Hao, he nodded slightly.
 Li Hao also nodded and continued to go downstairs.
 ……
 Stepping out of the main entrance of the Nightwalker headquarters, Li Hao let out a breath, a smile on his face. Another wonderful day!  Opposite the night patrollers 'headquarters.
 Recently, there had been people keeping an eye on them. They weren't actually observing in secret, but waiting openly. They weren't waiting for Li Hao, but for hou Xiaochen to come out of his seclusion so that they could inform everyone as soon as possible.
 When he saw Li Hao ...
 Some of the people who were drinking tea didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "I've been watching Yuan Shuo's disciple for the past two days. He's been coming to work and leaving work on time, not a minute more or less. He's even more accurate than a watch. I knew it was Sixo' clock when I saw him leaving."
 Opposite him, the person who was drinking tea with him also laughed."Is this the self-discipline of a Martial Master?"
 "Hahaha, probably. It's quite interesting, isn't it?"
 "That's true. The night patrollers are too boring. "
 They chatted and laughed as they watched Li Hao leave. They all shook their heads.
 Where did this weirdo come from!
 ……
 At the gate, Li Hao didn't care about the people opposite him.
 There were only small fish on the other side. There were a few small orbs of light that were so weak that they were almost invisible. The night patrolmen knew that there were supers on the other side, but no one cared. They were all sent by some organizations to keep an eye on them. They were openly watching them, and no one deliberately chased them away.
 Li Hao walked along the street.
 This place was too close to the night patrol, so there wouldn't be any danger. They would have to walk for at least ten minutes before they might encounter anything.
 For the past two days, he had also been reading it along the way.
 On the way to the inspection Office, there were three possible places that could be dangerous.
 However, considering hou Xiaochen's power, the first location was still too close. There was a high chance that it would be the second or third.
 The second place was a small alley. There were usually very few people. The small alley was about 100 meters long and there were tall buildings on both sides. It blocked the light and was suitable for an ambush.
 The other place was a parking lot about 500 meters away from the family building of the inspection Office. There weren't many people there. After all, there weren't many people with cars.
 Of course, it was the same everywhere.
 For Li Hao, as long as he was a super, he would not be mistaken about such a huge ball of light.
 After walking for a while, they passed by a bun shop. Li Hao didn't buy any buns tonight.
  He was afraid that the buns would go to waste.
 He kept walking until he was more than 3000 meters away from the Nightwalker headquarters. At this time, Li Hao saw some orbs of light surrounding him.
 There was one underground.
 There were also some on the ground.
 These guys had been staring at him for a few days, and he wondered what was so interesting about it.
 Li Hao turned a blind eye to it and continued walking.
 Another thousand meters or so and they would reach the small alley.
 At such a distance, ordinary balls of light couldn't be seen clearly.
 Unless ... The ball of light was huge!
 He walked for a while, and a smile appeared on his face. Yu Xiaoting was good at finding a place, and he actually knew that this place was suitable for an ambush. It seemed that this person was not arrogant enough to make a move without any restraint.

 That's right. At this moment, he saw a ball of light. It was Yu Xiao 's.
 Everyone's orbs of light were different.
 Some were stronger, some were weaker, some had different attributes, and some had different forms.
 If one looked carefully, they would be able to identify the person.
 However ... Li Hao frowned slightly.
 Yu Xiao, middle stage of three yang realm, this he knew.
 However, less than 500 meters away from Yu Xiao, there was another ball of light to the side. It was very big, even bigger than Yu Xiao 'S. Li Hao immediately frowned.
 There's another one?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Which one?
 That light ball was slightly stronger than sun Yifei 's. Peak of three suns?
  He wasn't as strong as the purple Moon and the Samsara King, but he was slightly stronger than the late three yang realm.
 Today, there was actually a peak three-yang in the vicinity.
 Of course, it was not in an alley.
 Li Hao frowned. The distance was too close. It was only 500 meters. For an expert, such a short distance could be covered in a few seconds.
 He was a little puzzled and felt that it was too troublesome.
 Why were there two three suns?
 'Alright, perhaps my words from before have attracted the attention of some powerhouses.'
 Li Hao was also helpless!
 As expected, plans often couldn't keep up with changes.
 Originally, he had thought that there would only be one person. He actually wanted to try and see if he could deal with the middle stage of the three suns. Now that his strength was no longer the same as before, he was eager to try.
 However, the addition of a peak three yang ... Would be a little troublesome.
 ……
 At this moment.
 In an alley.
 At some point in time, a dead tree trunk appeared in the dead-silent alley.
 This was Yu Xiao's hidden ability.
 As an expert of the wood element, the wood evasion and wood concealment were the basic skills.
 He also calculated the time. It was almost time.
 That brat Li Hao is coming.
 That kid should have brought the blueprint, right?
 Based on his understanding from yesterday, this guy would most likely bring it. However, in order to not attract attention, he didn't ask Li Hao for it today. Otherwise, it would be too conspicuous if he kept asking Li Hao for it.
 Later on, he had to be gentler. Otherwise, it would be difficult to deal with him if he exploded.
 He wanted the blueprint.
 He also wanted a complete corpse.
 One could not be lacking!
 However, he frowned slightly. There seemed to be an earth element being active underground. Sunlight?  He was a little annoyed.
 These rats were very annoying. Were they following Li Hao, or were they just passing by?
 Or perhaps, they were here to protect Li Hao?
 No matter who it was, Yu Xiao felt that if this guy was still alive after he killed Li Hao, he would kill him as well.
 At this moment, Yu Xiao was still wearing a mask on his face. It was a devil mask.
 Just as he was feeling annoyed by the guy underground, another person appeared in the alley.
 A faint voice came from the short alley.""Are you sure he'll pass by here?"
 "Of course. I've been observing him for two days. He's always on time. There's only two minutes left. He'll definitely be here."
 "Are you confident? "You have to be fast. That fellow is also an existence who has broken through a hundred perfection. He's not weak, and he's even Yuan Shuo's disciple. Don't think that he's weak just because he's young ..."
 "Nonsense. We're both in the perfect hundred-realm, and we're experienced. As long as we're fast, that guy won't be able to react."
 Yu Xiao was so angry that he laughed. F * ck, why is there still someone here?
 Two martial masters?
 Moreover, they were both at the level of surpassing a hundred. Did these two guys also have their eyes on Li Hao?
 Li Hao was really popular.
 Alright, I'll have to be more ruthless later. Don't let these two leave even if they come.
 Just as he was thinking, his ears quivered slightly, and Yu Xiao's expression changed slightly.
 He had fought with martial masters before, so he was no stranger to Martial Master douqian. He squinted his eyes and hid in the dead tree, looking around.
 Soon, he seemed to sense something. He looked up and saw no one, but there seemed to be something above the wall of the alley.
 "Martial Master douqian!"
 Yu Xiao frowned. Damn it, What day is it today?
 So many people were joining in the fun?
 In a small alley, there was a sunshiny earth element warrior underground, two martial masters above the ground, and a warrior master above. All the warrior Masters were famous, so he wondered who was above.
 Of course, he was not afraid.
 Unless one was a Martial Master like Yuan Shuo or an old Martial Master who had been famous for decades, even Martial Master douqian was only in the first layer of the radiant sun realm. He was just a little puzzled. 'Have these guys discussed this beforehand?'
 Why did he have to choose today?
  "These bastards ... The most troublesome one is this Martial Master douqian. I have to kill him first so that he won't waste my time and ruin my plan!"
 Yu Xiao cursed in his heart. If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have chosen this place.
 Of course, if he didn't choose this place, he would be in tears if Li Hao was killed. He could only say that he had to help Li Hao get rid of the threat of Martial Master douqian. Otherwise, he was worried that his plan would be ruined.
 ……
 At the entrance of the alley.
 Before Li Hao entered the alley, he didn't sense the presence of a Martial Master. But the moment he stepped into the alley, he knew that he was being watched by a warrior. As for the other two martial masters ... He couldn't be bothered.
 Weak chicken!
 Douqian Martial Master?
 There really was a Martial Master who had designs on him. This guy was quite bold.
 As for the two perfection martial masters, they were pretending to be passersby and entering the alley from the other side. It seemed that they were going to make a move on Li Hao when they encountered him. Although there were few people in the alley, it wasn't strange to encounter two people.

 However, with Li Hao's current eyesight, he could tell at a glance that these two were martial masters who had comprehended force. However, they were very weak, probably only at the perfection of 100.
 As for Yu Xiao, the rotten wood in front of him had almost turned into a ball of light. Li Hao wasn't blind, and he could clearly see it.
 There was also an earth-elemental one underground. He was at the late-stage of the solar glory realm and was not too weak.
 Apart from these people, Li Hao also discovered another person. Even Yu Xiao didn't notice it. A ball of light was floating in the air above the alley, about a hundred meters above the ground. It was probably a wind elemental user who was watching from the air.
 Yu Xiao didn't dare to casually release his mysterious energy to sense it, probably because he didn't sense that guy's existence.
 Li Hao raised his head slightly and looked at the ball of light. Judging from its brightness, it was probably at the late or peak of the solar glory realm.
 After all, the three suns were not everywhere.
 In fact, sunlight was already very good.
 Are you treating me like a treasure?
 Li Hao wasn't angry. On the contrary, he was quite happy. So many people cared about him, which was worth being happy about. Who would have the privilege of being escorted by so many people?
  He continued forward.
 The alley wasn't very long. After walking for a while, the faces of the two people in front of them could be seen clearly. The two people were chatting with each other like friends and happened to pass by.
 Be it Yu Xiao or Dou Qian, there was no movement.
 From the looks of it, he seemed to be waiting for the two of them to make the first move.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, couldn't wait.
 He quickened his pace a little, as if he was in a hurry to go back for dinner.
 The distance between him and the two of them was also getting closer and closer.
 30 meters, 20 meters ...
 When the distance between the three of them was less than 10 meters, both Dou Qian above and Yu Xiao below were ready to make a move.
 At this moment, the sword at Li Hao's waist trembled slightly.
 In an instant!
 In an instant, he disappeared without a trace!
 Shadowless Sword!
 At this moment, Li Hao didn't wait for the Sandpiper and clam to fight and the third party to benefit.
 No need!
 The earth overturning sword instantly disappeared and reappeared in an instant. The sword streaked across!
 It was past 6 O' clock in Whitemoon city, and the sunset was still there.
 However, the alley was slightly dark, and the tall buildings on both sides blocked the light.
 The two of them were still moving forward.
 They were still thinking about how to take down Li Hao in an instant ... When they suddenly felt an itch in their throats and had the urge to cough.
 As they continued forward, they were less than five meters away from Li Hao when they wanted to attack.
 They looked at each other ... Suddenly, they both noticed something strange. They were a little confused. Why was there a line of blood on each other's throat?
 Strange, where did this blood line come from?
 The two of them turned their heads to look at each other, but as they turned their heads ... They felt a little light-headed, and their heads ... Seemed to fly down.
  Both of their eyes revealed a look of horror!  There was no pain. This moment was too fast.
 It was so fast that the blood line instantly enlarged, and there was no time for the blood to splash out.
 As for Li Hao, he didn't even look at the two of them after his throat was slit.
 There was no need to look any longer!
 In the next moment, Li Hao jumped into the sky and slashed out with his sword. The sword radiance was like a mountain, and it could cut through the sky!
 A hundred meters up in the air, a wind element super had yet to come back to his senses when he suddenly felt his scalp go numb. His power exploded and just as he was about to escape, a sword pierced through his body from below!
 A sword that could slice the heavens!
 Even Dou Qian, who was about to block the sword, couldn't stop it. He could only watch Li Hao jump over his head and disappear in an instant.
 On the wall of the alley, the Martial Master douqian was still wearing a mask.
 His eyes, however, were a little dazed.
 He raised his head and saw Li Hao slashing the sky with his sword.
 The sword Qi pierced through the world!
 However, it was only a flash and did not attract much attention in the sunset.
 Just as he was thinking about this, his expression changed drastically. With a roar, a Dragon seemed to appear on his body. A huge Dragon, and the spear in his hand instantly charged at Li Hao!
 He used a gun!
 At this moment, Li Hao, who was falling to the ground, let out a fierce roar.
 His roar was more powerful and furious than before.
 A mountain peak instantly appeared on the earth overturning sword in his hand.
 Earth sword force!
 Breaking momentum, accumulating spirit, accumulating momentum to come out!
 This sword made the douqian Martial Master pale with shock.
 The spear and the earth-covered sword collided. In an instant, the giant dragon roared and was cut in half by the sword. The sword instantly cut the spear in half. Li Hao slashed down with the sword in his right hand and punched with his left!
 BOOM!
  With a loud bang, Martial Master douqian felt his arms shake violently. His arms cracked instantly, and his spear broke. His divine will was damaged. While he was still in a daze, he threw out a punch that sounded like a tiger's roar!
 With a bang, the watermelon exploded!
 Li Hao didn't even look at it. He stomped the ground, and with a boom, the earth seemed to shake. Everything happened so fast that the earth mage underground didn't even have time to react. Li Hao stabbed his sword into the ground. BOOM!
 The ground cracked, and an extremely powerful sword intent seeped into the ground, heading straight for the earth element cultivator.
 Only now did the earth element super feel the danger. Just as he was about to escape, he felt an infinite pressure from all directions. Just as he was about to break through, he felt like the earth was going against him.
 In the next moment, a sword ray flashed in his mind like a mountain!
 BOOM!
 The corpse exploded on the ground!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In an instant, two hundred-plus martial masters, one thousand-fighting Martial Master, the wind-elemental sunlight shining in the sky, and the earth-elemental sunlight shining on the ground-five people who could be considered experts-were all killed by Li Hao's overgrown sword!
 The dead wood disappeared, revealing a face wearing a ghost mask.

 At this moment, Yu Xiao was gasping for breath and in shock.
 Li Hao?
 This is Li Hao?
 He couldn't help but be shocked. Just now, he was also about to attack. His plan was to deal with Martial Master Dou Qian first, then deal with them, and then deal with Li Hao ... But before he could attack, Li Hao attacked first.
 At that moment, he was actually at a loss.
 He couldn't even believe it ...
 And in the moment he was shocked, the battle ended. Everyone died.
 A broken corpse was falling from the sky.
 It was too fast!
 All of this had happened too quickly, too quickly, so quickly that he didn't even have time to recover.
  Li Hao didn't say anything the moment he showed himself.
 At this moment, a fiery light appeared on the earth overturning sword.
 The next moment, Li Hao seemed to have transformed into a fierce tiger, and his roar resounded in all directions!
 A trapped beast was still fighting!
 Even a trapped beast could break the heavens.
 With a slash of his sword, flames lit up the sky and lit up the small alley.
 His spleen and heart burst out with dazzling light at the same time. At this moment, Li Hao only wanted to kill.
 Middle stage of three yang?
 So what!
 He didn't have time to speak, question, or think about why Li Hao was so powerful.
 At this moment, Yu Xiao also let out a fierce roar. A green wooden sword appeared in his hand, and he instantly charged at Li Hao. He had no choice but to attack. At this moment, he felt as if he was surrounded by mountains and the earth.
 If he wanted to leave, it wouldn't be so easy.
 A powerful force exploded.
 Wood energy, extremely tough.
 However, it still couldn't block Li Hao's sword. With a slash of the sword, the wood was shattered.
 The defense of the middle stage of the three yang realm did not seem so strong at this moment.
 In his mind, he recalled the self-severing sword and the fierce battle yesterday. A hint of madness and anger flashed across Li Hao's face.
 I have a fierce tiger in my heart, and my sword will not return!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com All of you should be killed!
 In the battle of martial masters and his battle with sun moxiian, Li Hao only felt admiration, pity, and desire for victory. His killing intent ... Was not as strong.
 It was a sparring session between martial masters, and it was also a battle of life and death.
 However, these people in front of him were not worthy of his attention and respect. What were they?
 Break me!
 The Tiger roared crazily and determinedly. He slashed out with his sword. With a loud boom, the wooden sword was broken. Li Hao instantly took a step forward, and the ground shook.
 At this moment, Yu Xiao saw a ferocious Tiger, a ferocious Tiger that was riddled with injuries.  In the next moment, the earth overturning sword instantly exploded, shattering into hundreds of pieces.
 Every single one of them was a killing move.
 Puchi!
 Countless fragments slashed across Yu Xiao's face and body. Blood instantly spurted out, and his wood energy instantly recovered.
 The earth overturning sword had shattered.
 At this moment, the earth overturning sword actually shattered.
 But Li Hao didn't care. Hong Yitang had said that the earth-overturning sword was very powerful, but in Li Hao's opinion, it was just so-so. A spirit accumulation strike might not be able to keep the earth-overturning sword intact. It was normal for it to shatter.
 Today, the sword intent was the main force, and the Tiger momentum was also the main force.
 Li Hao used his hand as a sword and punched out. It was like a tiger pouncing, or a Tiger's head as a sword.
 Perhaps Li Hao didn't even try to distinguish between sword intent and Tiger aura.
 He instantly moved forward and closed the distance. One punch after another, it was so crazy that Yu Xiao's superpower erupted. Wave after wave, it was still unstoppable. Yu Xiao's eyes were filled with shock and despair.
 How was that possible?
 Was he still a Martial Master?
 Other than Yuan Shuo, was there another Martial Master as powerful as him in this world?
 He was at the mid three yang realm, but he had almost no chance to counterattack when his opponent got close. Li Hao's fighting style was very similar to Yuan Shuo 's. They were extremely similar. They had the advantage and the offensive. That was the beginning and the end of the battle.
 He could either kill the enemy or ... Be killed by others!
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 He punched out a hundred times in a row, each punch stronger than the last. In the last punch, the ninth refinement force exploded. Under that one punch, Yu Xiao felt the danger of death. He roared and no longer cared about his identity being exposed. All the wood energy gathered in his chest. He did not want to die!
 He was a genius, a middle stage of the three yang realm. He could feel the terror of this punch!
 He could even sense a powerful aura approaching from not far away. It was ... Old yellow!
 He's here!
 Old Huang was following me?
 Of course, at this moment, he didn't care. He only wanted to live, even if all his secrets were exposed. He looked behind Li Hao."Old yellow is here. Peak of the three suns, save me!"
 At this moment, old yellow, who had been following him, had become his life-saving straw.
  Old yellow, who had just stepped into the alley, had a look of disbelief in his eyes.
 He had arrived very quickly. The moment Li Hao's sword aura erupted, he had rushed over in an instant. Old yellow felt that he had only been here for five or six seconds, including his reaction time and the time he had spent in a daze.
 Really, that was the most!
 This was because he had some apprehensions. He had some apprehensions. Yu Xiao seemed to be up to something. Was it appropriate for him to appear rashly?
 Hence, he was delayed for a while.
 However, it was only a short period of time.
 At this moment, he saw a fist that was like the claw of a Tiger, like a sword, and a little like a wave ...
 He couldn't tell what fist technique this was.
 He only saw that punch instantly shatter Yu Xiao's mask. As the punch landed, the wood energy defense in front of Yu Xiao was instantly shattered into pieces. This punch had directly penetrated Yu Xiao!
 Yu Xiao's mouth opened and closed, as if he was asking for help.

 "Stop!"
 At this moment, old yellow's voice was heard.
 His face was ashen, a little frightened and a little angry.
 This person ... Was he Li Hao?
 He had killed Yu Xiao!
 That's right. When Yu Xiao was punched through, his heart could be seen and instantly shattered. At that moment, he knew that there was no way for Yu Xiao to survive. Even if the other party was a wood element expert, there was no way for him to survive.
 Only death was the final destination!
 Yu Xiao, who was at the middle stage of the three yang realm, had been killed right in front of his eyes.
 He was furious ...
 Other than that, there was only shock and disbelief.
  Was this Yuan Shuo in disguise?
 The person in front of him was not Li Hao, but Yuan Shuo?
 Of course, he wouldn't be afraid even if it was Yuan Shuo. Yuan Shuo's peak battle record was killing sun Yifei, who was in the late-stage, while he was a powerhouse at the peak of the three-sun realm.
 With a loud bang, a corpse suddenly fell from the sky.
 Li Hao turned around and looked at the blond man. This was the man he had seen.
 It came quite slowly, a little slower than expected.
 The body that fell down was the wind Magus that had just been killed.
 At this moment, Li Hao's fists were covered in blood, both his own and Yu Xiao 's.
 Drip ...
 Blood dripped from his fist.
 Old yellow looked at Li Hao with anger and a sharp glint in his eyes. He said coldly,""How dare you kill a night patrol ..."
 Buzzzzzz!
 With a whooshing sound, Li Hao rose from the ground and charged at the man.
 Peak of the three suns?
 Very, very strong!
 However, the fire in his heart seemed to have not been extinguished.
 Since you're already here ... Then don't leave.
 In an instant, a sword appeared in Li Hao's hand. It was a small sword, not as lustrous as the Earthcover sword, but rather gloomy. It was the starry sky sword.
 In an instant, Li Hao's vital energy and blood boiled, and his essence, energy, and spirit merged into the starry sky sword.
 He knew that under normal circumstances, even if he killed Yu Xiao, he would not be a match for this person. At this moment, he was at most on par with the genius Yuan Shuo.
 When his teacher killed sun Yifei that day, it was the second time that he managed to kill sun Yifei, and he was severely injured.
 This man in front of him was definitely not weaker than sun Yifei.
 Therefore ... Without using the art of bloody blade, it was impossible to defeat this person.
 But, what did it matter?
 The bloody blade art erupted. At this moment, Li Hao had transformed into a fierce tiger, covered in blood-red flames that burned the sky.
 "Heart fire ape?"
 This was old Huang's first thought. Yuan Shuo was most famous for killing sun Yifei, but ... Why did this person look like a fierce tiger?
 The second thought was that this was the art of the bloody blade that Yuan Shuo had once used.
  The night patrolman had recorded this.  Was this person Yuan Shuo?
 The moment these two thoughts appeared, Li Hao was already in front of old yellow. Old yellow snorted coldly.
 In an instant, a long spear appeared.
 The Golden spear!
 As the spear was thrust out, the sharp metal-elemental power burst out instantly. Countless holes appeared on the walls on both sides, which were shattered by the sharp air.
 Li Hao's inner strength gushed into the starry sky sword, greatly reducing its defensive power.
 In the blink of an eye, the inspector's uniform was dyed blood red.
 But Li Hao didn't care at all!
 As a Martial Master, the only thing he could do now was kill!
 As he slashed out with his sword, the image of that ferocious Tiger that was still fighting despite being trapped appeared in his mind once again!
 If you don't give me a way out, I won't give you a way out.
 Buzzzzzz!
 The sword energy soared into the sky, but in the next moment, it instantly disappeared and was instantly restrained. Li Hao spat out a mouthful of sword energy and slashed out with the starry sky sword at the same time. With a bang, the Golden spear was shattered!
 Under the effect of the art of bloody blade, coupled with the small sword that could destroy everything, this sword might not be as strong as the opponent, but its destructive power had reached the extreme.
 A flash of sword light broke through everything in an instant. With a pfft, it pierced through old yellow's shoulder.
 Old yellow had never seen such a terrifying person!
 It wasn't that his strength was terrifying, but that his killing intent was extremely dense ...
 There was no greeting, no identification, no pause, nothing.
 The moment he appeared, there was only killing intent in his eyes. It was as if he was telling him that if they met, one of them would die, either you or me.
 He had dodged a little, so only his shoulder was pierced. If he had not dodged, his throat would have been pierced.
 Every move killed him!
 Old yellow's expression changed. He wasn't afraid of this person, but he felt that if this continued, he would get injured, seriously injured, and even ... Die!
 What did Yu Xiao, this bastard, do?
 Was the person in front of him Li Hao or Yuan Shuo?
 p He didn't have the mood to think about it and left.  He could just tell Hu Qingfeng that Yu Xiao had died here. He wanted to leave this damn place, and he was slightly regretful that he had followed Yu Xiao here.
 Even if he won ... So what?
 This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He began to retreat!
 But was Li Hao willing to let him go?
 The moment he landed, he stomped his foot, and the entire alley split open. The walls collapsed. With all this, Li Hao's sword attacked at an extremely fast speed!
 "You ..."
 Old yellow was furious. It was obvious that it wanted to retreat. This person should have seen through it. Did he not want to live?
 He knew a thing or two about the blood Blade art. The longer one used it, the higher the chance of death.
 You and I have no enmity, you're crazy, killing Yu Xiao wasn't enough, you're actually not willing to let me leave ...
 At this moment, he also felt some supernatural fluctuations. It seemed that the battle here had attracted the attention of many people.
 Old yellow didn't want to continue fighting with this lunatic!
 He quickly conjured a golden armor and wrapped his entire body in metal-elemental power. He said angrily,""Are you crazy? You can't kill me, and I don't have the mood to kill you ..."

 BOOM!
 A sword slashed over. The powerful starry sky sword directly split open the Golden armor formed by superpowers. Under the sword, blood splattered. Old yellow groaned and no longer had the mood to Shout!
 The sword had almost cut off his arm.
 He looked at the sword in Li Hao's hand in shock ... What is this?
 Origin god weapon?
 No... It didn't look like it, but this sword was unbelievably sharp. His defense at the peak of the three suns realm was actually broken by one sword.
 He knew that he had made a mistake.
 He should not have defended!
 This person's sword was indestructible. How could he defend now? he was stronger than Li Hao, so he should attack!
 In an instant, he reacted.
  He threw a punch at Li Hao!
 Li Hao's eyes brightened, and the next moment, he returned a punch. BOOM!
 The powerful force of the punch cracked Li Hao's arm and damaged old Huang's fist, causing blood to splatter.
 Old yellow cursed in his heart, crazy!
 He didn't dare to defend anymore and took the initiative to attack. He threw another punch at Li Hao, who withdrew his starry sky sword.
 In close combat, the sword was a hindrance and a waste of time.
 Fist against fist!
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 In the blink of an eye, their fists collided countless times. Li Hao took a few steps back and stepped on countless bricks. His arm was covered in blood, and his entire right hand drooped down. All the bones in it had been broken!
 As for old yellow, it was also gasping for breath, and blood kept dripping from its right hand.
 His opponent wasn't as strong as him, but he didn't care about his life. After exchanging fists, he felt like his arm was going to be crippled.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com While he was panting, Li Hao pounced on him again.
 This time, Li Hao didn't throw a punch. Instead, he kicked in the air. His leather boots had long been torn apart, and at this moment, the sound of waves could be heard from Li Hao's feet. It was the ninth-refinement force!
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 One kick after another, one kick after another ...
 Kachaa!
 The sound of bones breaking came from Li Hao's feet, but he still smiled. On the other side, old Huang's arms were cracked and bleeding, and his face was pale.
 Old yellow looked at Li Hao coldly. The next moment, a golden spear appeared in front of him!
 It was fine for a superhuman to be physically disabled, as long as his mysterious ability was still there.
 But you, a Martial Master, have crippled one of your hands and both of your legs. What can you do?
 No matter how ruthless you are, with your strength, you are still inferior to me!
 p The spear was in the air, and no one was controlling it. It went straight for Li Hao's head.  At this moment, Li Hao smiled again and instantly pounced. The tiger's roar was silent, only a sound wave was produced!
 The long spear trembled!
 Li Hao's intact left hand held the starry sky sword. Countless sword energy surged into his body. He waved the sword and slashed. A ray of light was drawn out of the darkness, and the Golden spear was cut open by this sword!
 In the next moment, like Wang Ming's fairy scattering flowers, countless metal elemental energy exploded and instantly enveloped Li Hao.
 Old yellow also knew this move!
 The peak of three suns was not fake.
 He wasn't yu Xiao who had been beaten senseless. At this moment, his battle prowess was still strong. With a loud boom, Li Hao was blown away like a raggedy doll, his body covered in blood!
 Old yellow's face turned pale and he snorted coldly.
 This guy, he's still not dead this time?
 At this moment, Li Hao, who had fallen to the ground, instantly got up and kept coughing up blood. He smiled.
 In an instant, a fiery red Tiger head sword appeared.
 This sword was filled with raging anger!
 "Slash!"
 With another roar, Li Hao slashed his sword, cutting through the sky. Activating the flying bird technique, Li Hao flew forward in disbelief. He was like a silver-tier warrior slashing at the sky. All the enemies in front of him would be crushed by him!
 No one was an exception!
 Old yellow's expression changed slightly, and it quickly retreated.
 This lunatic ... He really didn't want to fight with this person anymore.
 At this moment, a flame erupted behind him. Old yellow's expression changed drastically, and so did Li Hao 'S. He looked a little angry, and he couldn't vent it.
 "Kill!"
  His speed exploded once again, increasing by 30%. With a bit of madness, he slashed out with his sword!  Behind old yellow, Hao lianchuan's expression changed slightly.
 However, he did not stop. He stabbed his spear into old yellow's back. At this moment, he could not describe the shock in his heart, but ... He had no time to think about it!
 Old yellow's expression changed drastically. After weighing his options, he chose to face Li Hao directly!
 I feel that it's very dangerous behind!
 He was more dangerous than the half-crippled Li Hao, so he chose to face Li Hao head-on.
 A long spear appeared once again. In an instant, it turned into ten Spears, then a hundred Spears ...
 At this moment, with a flash of light, Li Hao directly passed through the forest of Spears. His body was riddled with bloody holes, but he still ruthlessly slashed out with his sword!
 Puchi!
 With a strike of his sword, old yellow's expression changed again. However, the powerful pressure behind him made it impossible for him to retreat. He roared in anger and wanted to swing his fist again, but the short sword had already pierced through his head!
 His fist, however, still swung out and sent Li Hao flying with the last of its radiance.
 Li Hao was sent flying and fell heavily to the ground. He made no sound, as if he was already dead.
 Behind him, a long spear had pierced through old yellow. Hao lianchuan threw old yellow away as if he was throwing trash. He looked at the battlefield ... There was only shock in his eyes that could not be erased!
 He didn't take too long, taking about 20 seconds.
 This was what he and Li Hao had agreed on. The shortest time would be 10 seconds, and the slowest time would be 30 seconds.
 He had already rushed over and arrived as soon as possible.
 However, at this moment, he was a little dazed and shocked.
 Yu Xiao was dead!
 On the ground, there were a few broken corpses. Other than that, he recognized the person he had just thrown off. He was one of the five-man Group, Huang Jie. He was at the peak of the three suns realm and was a metal-Elemental Expert. He was best at attacking.
 Even if he had the fire Phoenix spear, he might not be able to take down the other party in a short time.
 The reason why he was able to team up with Li Hao and force Huang Jie to his death so easily ... Was because when he arrived, Huang Jie only had 50% of his strength left, definitely not more than 50%!
 Under such circumstances, he was no match for Hao lianchuan, who was wielding the fiery phoenix spear.
 And the one who had forced Huang Jie to this point was none other than Li Hao!
 It was a Martial Master who had already killed a middle stage three yang cultivator!
 Hao lianchuan knew that Li Hao was the one who had killed them.
 That was because all the dead people either had sword light or undisguisable Tiger momentum.
 This was the means of a Martial Master!
 It was as if he had met Li Hao for the first time. At this moment, he didn't even have the time to look at Li Hao. He didn't know if Li Hao was still alive or not. He seemed to be completely motionless. He couldn't hide the shock in his heart.
 Was this ... Really Li Hao and not Yuan Shuo?
 He had no doubt that Yuan Shuo had gone so far.
 But was it possible for Li Hao?
 In the distance, rays of light erupted. Supers were approaching quickly. No one could see this, or Li Hao's matter would be exposed.
 Even a fool could see this obvious sword intent and Tiger aura.
 He instantly soared into the air and took out the Phoenix spear without looking at Li Hao. In an instant, all the nearby supers stopped in their tracks, because they recognized the Phoenix spear!
 Hao lianchuan roared,"be on guard!" Get ready for battle! How dare you attack Li Hao in the city? you deserve to die! All the night patrollers were to be deployed to lock down the entire city and exterminate the powerful enemies! Minister hou, please come out of your seclusion!"
 The roar shook the world!
 Hao lianchuan roared. The fire Phoenix soared in the sky. At that moment, the entire city moved, and the powerhouses 'expressions changed.
 Red Moon?
 This is crazy!
 At this moment, they actually attacked Li Hao. Did they not want to live?
 The next moment, a powerful aura rose from the night patrolman headquarters. A light flashed and the powerful aura covered the South City!
  The strong ones were here!
 Was it hou Xiaochen?
 Other than him, there seemed to be no one else. The powerhouses who were close to the battlefield all paled, and no one dared to get any closer.
 Something bad was going to happen!
 Hong Yue had really gone crazy. Some of the people who knew about it were even more shocked. This was not the plan.
 In the distance, Hu Qingfeng frowned. Was LAN Yue an idiot?
 They had already agreed to deal with hou Xiaochen together, so why did they attack first?
 Damn bastard!
 In the sky, Hao lianchuan's expression changed as he looked down. He only heaved a sigh of relief when he saw a figure slowly getting up. However, he could not hide the shock in his eyes.
 Li Hao ... You ... How strong are you?

 Superpowers surged in all directions.
 At the night patrolman headquarters, a ray of light flashed, cut through the void, and headed straight for this place.
 In the air, Hao lianchuan was still trembling with fear.
 He wasn't afraid of the powerhouses, but he couldn't forget the previous scene. He couldn't forget Li Hao's extremely fierce sword attack. Li Hao had clearly seen him coming, but his eyes were still extremely fierce. At the last moment, he had still put his life on the line and killed Huang Jie with a single strike.
 That look in her eyes ... Even Hao lianchuan could not describe it.
 Like a wild beast out of its cage?
 Revenge?
 Or was it a simple killing gaze?
 He looked down and saw the figure struggling to get up again.
 ……
  In an alley.
 Li Hao struggled to get up. Sword energy surged in his body, and some of his injuries quickly recovered.
 The remaining power of the blood shadow, combined with the sword energy, was very effective.
 The Tiger returned to its cage!
 The Tiger head sword exuded the power of flames and obediently entered his heart. However, it seemed to still be waiting to devour him. However, it did not struggle as before. It was as if it had gone into hibernation and hidden in the forest, waiting for the next opportunity to attack.
 ……
 At this moment, on the White moon Mountain outside the city.
 A fierce multicolored Tiger with a broken tooth turned its head and glanced at Zhou Qin. Carefully, it probed step by step and gradually hid into the forest. The moment it left, the Tiger's eyes were filled with ferocity.
 Zhou Qin frowned slightly. The friend beside him twisted his body unnaturally and said in a low voice,""This Tiger ... When it left, the way it looked at us was a little scary."
 "Old Zhou, are we really going to let it go just like that?"
 Zhou Qin was silent for a while. He nodded and did not say anything more. He let her go.
 Wang Ming's friend greeted him. He was just a Tiger. Zhou Qin actually hadn't asked much about his friend, and there was no need to. He could roughly guess that his friend was Li Hao from Silver City, a Martial Master.
 A Martial Master ... He thought of the look in that guy's eyes when he first saw him. It was actually somewhat similar to this Tiger.
 Zhou Qin wasn't stupid. He felt that this ferocious Tiger might take revenge on him.
 However, he was more afraid of that Martial Master!
 He was a little scared, but he couldn't say much.
 Yuan Shuo ... The old demon!
 Zhou Qin had asked around about his disciple Li Hao. They all said that he was a good kid. However, Zhou Qin felt that it was because Li Hao had hidden his true colors well. In fact, he was also a cruel person.
 Would the old Devil's disciple be a good person?
 This ferocious Tiger was not strong enough, but he knew how to hold back. If he let the Tiger go now, perhaps this fellow would come looking for him when he had the strength.
 But that Li Hao ... What if he had the strength?
 If it wasn't handled well, it would be a big problem!
  It wasn't that he was too smart, but that he had seen Li Hao's different eyes and attitude. He wasn't as honest and diligent as the rumors made him out to be. He didn't know where the rumors had come from.  ……
 In the alley, Li Hao was in no mood to care about the Tiger.
 He struggled to get up, and a faint smile suddenly appeared on his face. He looked up at the sky and saw the fire Phoenix flying. Beside the fire Phoenix, Hao lianchuan was also looking down.
 This time, he saw Li Hao's smile.
 He was smiling so innocently!
 Hao lianchuan suddenly felt a chill in his heart. He knew that this kid was not a good person. However, at this moment, this kid had killed so many people and he was also seriously injured. At this moment, he was actually smiling so innocently!
 Was this real or just a pretense?
 But when there was no one around, when everyone around him had died, was there a need for him to do so?
 Li Hao was really laughing.
 He felt ... Very comfortable?
 He felt that he had killed quite a lot of people. Did he feel that these people deserved to be killed?
 At that moment, Hao lianchuan did not know what he was thinking. He felt a little complicated.
 On the ground, Li Hao laughed and staggered to his feet. He quickly walked to the dead old Huang and searched his body. He took out a ring and didn't look at the rest.
 Then, he walked in front of Yu Xiao and fumbled around for a while before taking off a ring.
 Soon, he arrived in front of the warrior. His head was no longer there, and his body was badly damaged. Li Hao fumbled around and found a book, but it seemed to have been torn apart.
 It was normal. This was something some people liked to do.
 This spear Dao thousand fighting technique had brought the secret technique with him, but he was definitely missing the breathing technique. Some people might as well not bring the secret technique booklet. These were all very common.
 There were two storage rings and a book on secret techniques.
 Li Hao only took these three items.
 A moment later, he picked up the broken spearhead of the spear Dao warrior Qian and stabbed it towards old yellow's head. Immediately after, he stabbed towards the corpses of Yu Xiao and the others. Every spear strike accurately hit the sword marks on their bodies.
