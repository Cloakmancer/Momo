They had just solved a big problem, and now they were facing an even bigger problem.For a moment, even Heaven's Fate couldn't help but curse,""Damn, this broken Silver Moon is a small broken place. There are so many troubles ... I feel that it's more troublesome than the promotion of a great world!""Actually, there's another way ..." Li Hao laughed."What?""Dispel time!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 "What?""Dispel my time path!" Li Hao said.Li Hao looked at the sky and smiled."I seized the Dao of time directly. I didn't cultivate it bit by bit. I dispelled the Dao of time first, and then ... I gathered time again!" Go and repair time on your own!"Everyone was stunned. Was this okay?Li Hao exhaled."It's fine. Time is too complicated. I've gained some new insights this time. I'm going to dispel the Dao of time first, cultivate life and death, then yin and yang, then space, and finally gather time!"He had some new ideas, and his smile was bright."If that's the case, the reappearance of time will only make him stronger!""Black Panther, let's go. We'll avoid the Crimson Moon world first ... I'm going to dispel the time Dao ..."In the air, although the second cat was burnt, it turned to look at Li Hao with dissatisfaction and unwillingness."You can't ..."Li Hao exhaled. Suddenly, Time and Stars appeared."Senior, you can first preserve this star and immerse yourself in it. When I restore time again, you can return it to me ..."Obviously, he knew why the other party was unhappy.That was because if he did that, time would disappear and the past would no longer appear.Stunned, second cat looked at the star. This star was actually the core of Li Hao's Dao. He gave it to him ... Just like that?Second cat hesitated. Li Hao smiled and said,""I'll keep it for now. It's not like I'm giving it to you directly. Don't worry, I'll gather time again soon. I won't haggle with you over the chaos lightning tribulation today!"​ Everyone was helpless. You're saying it as if you can win!if another nine bolts of tribulation lightning came, everyone would be finished.to dispel time and dispel the lightning tribulation, this was the best choice for everyone."Then your strength ...""It's fine. Without time, I'm still a top-notch ninth level Dao integration cultivator. I'll advance to venerable sovereign even faster!"Li Hao laughed."Time is hard to cultivate, but ordinary DAOs are too simple!" These words made everyone feel even more helpless.Too simple?Was it really that simple?Perhaps it was true for Li Hao.Li Hao's smile became even more brilliant."Neo martial is so terrifying and amazing ... I'll advance to venerable sovereign first and then gather time. Sooner or later, I'll destroy this chaotic Thunder and go find neo martial ..."As soon as he finished speaking, a large amount of time power surged out of the time star and appeared between the heaven and earth. It spread out in all directions, and a part of it was instantly destroyed by the lightning.A part of it broke up and merged with the world.There was still a weak portion that remained in the star and was swallowed by the two cats. This little bit was only enough for the two cats to recall the past. After swallowing it, time was so weak that even the lightning tribulation couldn't detect it.Very quickly, the lightning in the sky started to dissipate.In the chaosverse, a giant beast was quickly moving away with the Silvermoon world in its belly.As for Li Hao, his body, which was originally filled with a mysterious aura, suddenly returned to normal at this moment. He was no different from an ordinary peak half-Emperor.It was less isolated from the world and more of earth energy.At this moment, Heaven's Fate, who had been under great pressure from Li Hao, let out a sigh of relief."Without the power of time ... You brat, you're not even as threatening as my true body ... I can kill you with one punch!"All of a sudden, she found Li Hao much cuter.Li Hao couldn't help but laugh.However, after dispersing time, Li Hao had some new insights. His time power was still too superficial. Perhaps regathering time was a good choice.The Dao of time was too high-end.He had reached the heavens in a single bound, and his Foundation was not stable. Otherwise, he would not have been struck by the lightning tribulation time and time again.The chaos lightning tribulation was nothing in front of a true master of time!At this moment, great DAOs emerged in the river of time. They were no longer as mysterious as before and began to resemble the river of chaos. Li Hao took a look and laughed. "That's good. After coming into contact with the high-end great Dao and looking at the ten thousand DAOs, I suddenly realized that the ten thousand DAOs are easy to cultivate! Venerable sovereign, you can wait for a long time!"“……”Everyone was speechless. Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang suddenly felt inferior.What ... Did he mean?

2571 Chapter 428
The time energy dissipated, and the primal Chaos tribulation lightning vanished.Just as Li Hao had said, when time was gone, chaos would not target anyone. In the vast chaos, there were countless experts. Other than the cycle of life and death, the past, the future ... In fact, chaos would not target anyone.Chaos was all-encompassing, unless there was something that could break The Order of Chaos, which would lead to its catastrophe.Within the chaosverse, an enormous beast as large as a star began to swim about.It was very fast...But in the vast primordial chaos, it seemed to be moving at the speed of a turtle.The place where the fireworks had been lit up seemed to be nearby ... But the Black Panther knew that it might take several years to swim there with the world.This was chaos!In this place, other than a group of top-notch existences, anyone else would seem particularly small.Silver Moon didn't have an expert like the human King or Emperor Cang. If they wanted to go to neo martial, they had to cross the Crimson Moon's territory ... Li Hao didn't choose to do so, and neither did Heaven's Fate and the others.They were at the edge of the Crimson Moon, and the place where neo martial had erupted was on the other side.It was too difficult and dangerous to cross the Crimson Moon world's territory. Therefore, their direction was actually the opposite of neo martial.They knew nothing about chaos.The celestial pole was no exception.He could vaguely sense that his actual body was in a distant place, but even the celestial pole did not mention anything about finding a new martial. It was too dangerous, and it was not something that Silver Moon could do at his current level.It was already his limit to escape the Crimson Moon.As for whether new martial would come to them ... Heaven's Fate hoped that it wouldn 't.This time, new martial had created a huge commotion and caused who knew how much trouble. The entire chaos seemed to have been affected, and Heaven's Fate did not want new martial to look for Silver Moon at this moment ... It would be best if they could forget about Silver Moon.Otherwise, if the new martial artists and silver Moon came into contact, any powerhouse would be able to easily destroy Silver Moon with his current strength.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ It's best to go further away!The two sides should try not to have too much contact.At the very least, he could protect one of his true body and clone.This was Heaven's Fate's thought.Zhang an actually understood this, but at this moment, Zhang an still missed neo martial and his grandfather. The Stargate opened, and he knew that neo martial was still there, on the other side of chaos.But ... He couldn't go back.For the new martial artists, only a few decades had passed. A few decades was nothing.However, to them, it had been a full 100000 years!Even though they had been in a deep sleep for many years, they knew that it had been 100000 years. They had not returned for 100000 years, and this group of people was starting to miss their home.Neo martial was their home.…… At this moment, Li Hao was sitting cross-legged on the giant beast, looking at the chaos in the distance and cultivating.In fact, he knew that Zhang an and the others wanted to go back.But ... He had no choice.I had no choice but to fulfill my promise and send them back to neo martial arts ... Because I had to leave the Crimson Moon world.The venerable sovereigns he had encountered today were much stronger than the one he had encountered that day.And such an existence ... In the entire chaos, or the Crimson Moon world, was he considered the strongest?It definitely wasn 't!As for Silver Moon, he had barely gained the power of a venerable sovereign, but he was not a true venerable sovereign yet. On the other hand, er Mao was not weak, but he did not care about anything else other than Zhan Tiandi.Even if Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang joined hands, they would still be inferior to Li Hao.How could such a Silver Moon ... Be involved in the war for the great world?The celestial pole's avatar did not know much about the chaos and the grades of venerable sovereigns. His avatar had been separated from him 100000 years ago. At that time, his main body had rarely set foot in the chaos.Therefore, the information that the clone had was limited.He had only made some simple divisions according to the strength of the new martial artists. However, he could only distinguish between the two venerable sovereigns who had appeared today. One was slightly stronger, and the other was slightly stronger ...Such a division made it impossible for Li Hao to clearly know how strong the Crimson Moon, neo martial, and chaos were!The Black Panther transformed into a giant beast and wandered in the chaos.As for Li Hao, he was surrounded by a long river and looked old.Earlier, his longevity had almost been completely exhausted. During the Tribulation, he had grown a bit more powerful, and his longevity had increased. He had gained some time enlightenment, which had increased his longevity a bit. But now ... He had returned to his previous state, and in fact, even worse!Li Hao, on the other hand, had yet to truly enter the venerable sovereign level.He hadn't transformed even once.If he advanced to venerable sovereign by walking an ordinary great Dao ... It wouldn't be ordinary. At this moment, Li Hao had some thoughts. He wanted to walk a slightly unique path and advance to venerable sovereign with the completion of the time great Dao as the foundation.He didn't have much time left, but Li Hao wasn't afraid of anything.If he wanted to advance to venerable sovereign ... It was not difficult.He had once overlooked even higher places. To him now, many things were just a Foundation. After experiencing the high mountains, looking at the mounds was nothing more than this!With a thought.A few people appeared beside him. They were surprised and shocked. Before, they didn't have time to look at Hundun. Now, they suddenly appeared on the Black Panther and looked at Hundun ... In an instant, they felt that they were extremely small.They were Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and Lin Hongyu. The three of them were confused. Why did Li Hao transfer them out of the black Panther's belly?Li Hao looked at the three of them. After a moment of silence, he said,""I have to advance to venerable sovereign as soon as possible ... Time waits for no one, and the chaos is not safe either. The Black Panther turned into heaven's will and took over the corpse of the Chaos Beast ... He's not weak, but in the chaos, he's nothing much!"

2572 Chapter 428
"Silvermoon has yet to give birth to her own true venerable sovereign!"The three of them were a little solemn. They had seen the battle between experts before, so they were actually a little nervous and uneasy.Li Hao continued,"I've temporarily given up on the path of time ... But that doesn't mean that I really won't cultivate it!" Of course, I need to improve my Foundation and advance to venerable sovereign at the same time ... There shouldn't be any lightning tribulation when I advance to venerable sovereign normally. "The few of them nodded. In fact, there was no thunder tribulation in the early stage when new martial arts gave birth to venerable sovereigns. The Tribulation of venerable sovereigns in the later stage was created by new martial arts.But Li Hao obviously didn't need to do this."But I might have to face a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation once I advance ... But it shouldn't be too strong!"Their hearts were in their throats again. How could that be?You don't even cultivate time anymore!Li Hao looked at Lin Hongyu and said,""I want to cultivate the Dao of life and death. With the Dao of life and death, I can advance to venerable sovereign!"Li Hao slowly said, life and death, yin and yang ... They're actually different! Life is the beginning and death is the end. Yin and yang belong to two sides, just like the great Dao of illusion and reality. The resurrection of people is not life and death, but yin and yang!"Lin Hongyu was deep in thought, but she still did not fully understand."True life and death is when one's life reaches its end," Li Hao continued."Then ... It continues. From beginning to end, it starts again, and ends again ...""Simply put, I'm going to die of old age ... To end this life! With the brilliance at the end of one's life, a Second Life will be born, just like ... The Imperial Guards!"The three of them were shocked!'What ... What does this mean?'They didn't quite understand, but they had a vague feeling that it wasn't simple.Li Hao explained,"this way, I can end all the karma in this life!" However, I'll start from scratch, just like the Emperor guards, and even my memories ... The memories of this life will become a thing of the past. In that case, even if I live a Second Life, I might not be myself anymore!"The Emperor guards and its father?The three of them finally understood!"Do you have to do this?" Lin Hongyu's expression changed.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"it's not necessary. It's just that this is the most beneficial for me. I've borrowed the power of my future self countless times. Perhaps I haven't repaid the karma yet!" Including the multiple injuries and revivals...They are all damaging my Foundation and Foundation!""I'm actually covered in injuries now. It's hard to heal from those Dao injuries!"Lin Hongyu's expression changed."Then you ... Are you no longer you?"Even if he inherited his memories ... Memories were just memories. After all, they weren't what Li Hao had really experienced. Wasn't this ... Like a different person? Li Hao nodded."It's no longer me ... So, I actually don't want it to be like this. So, I want to inherit my memories completely. Not inheritance, but to completely integrate them into myself. I don't want to live like the Emperor guards and become a second person!"Lin Hongyu let out a sigh of relief. Qian Wuliang said carefully,""Then Lord Marquis asked us to come ... To help Lord Marquis complete this mission?"Li Hao nodded."That's right. Including the Dao of life and death, I also need your help in order to perfectly complete my training!" I'm very clear about the cultivation method. The key is still the perfect fusion of memories ..."This was actually similar to the methods of some people, such as the young master of the Fengyun Pavilion. However, Li Hao obviously did not just want to reincarnate his spiritual power. That would be meaningless.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  He wanted to walk the true reincarnation of life and death!"How can I help you?"The three of them were all very serious, but Li Hao smiled and said,""It's difficult, but it's not! I'll start all over again and live a Second Life. This is actually a one-time cleansing of myself, and it'll be very fast ... What the three of you need to do is to guide me back to my true self at the critical moment!"Guidance?The three of them looked troubled. How could they guide him?Li Hao continued."I will start all over again, from an infant, a child, a teenager, a teenager ... All the way. At this moment, I am a blank piece of paper. What you three need to do is not to let your memories merge with me, but to awaken the memories that exist in me. This way, I will be the original me!""How do I wake him up?" "Every period of a person's life has its most unforgettable past!"Li Hao said slowly,"my parents, my brothers, my teachers, my friends ... These are the keys to awakening me! However, all of these only happen in the later stages. In the early stages ... I'm still young, especially when I'm an infant. I don't even know how to awaken my memories ..."The few of them looked at each other.If you don't know, how can we know?How could he awaken it?Li Hao also touched his chin and sighed. He could only recall,""When I was young, my family was harmonious. There weren't many twists and turns. I wasn't considered rich, but it was still good. There weren't many things that I would never forget.""Of course, there are some, but I'm not sure if I can wake myself up ... Of course, it's fine if I can't wake myself up at this time. I believe I can recover later. However, if I can't wake myself up at this time ..."Li Hao frowned slightly."There might be some deviations in my understanding of life and death. It's best if I can be awakened at the age of six, ten, or fifteen. I'll cultivate with my innate Dao body. This way, I can advance to venerable sovereign faster!"The few of them looked at each other again. This ... Was not easy to handle.If it was something else, everyone could still think of a way.But how would we know why you would wake up when you were young?

2573 Chapter 428
"We don't know much about you when you were young ... Why don't ... We get teacher Yuan to do it?" Lin Hongyu was at a loss."Teacher doesn't know either."Li Hao shook his head. He had only acknowledged his teacher when he was in University. At that time, Li Hao was certain that he could recover his memories, so he didn't need to trouble his teacher.At this moment, Li Hao touched his chin. After a while, he said,""I'll tell you some simple things, and I still remember some things. You can do as you see fit. If there's really no way ... You ..."He looked at them and said with a bitter smile,"I'll try it as a last resort. Let's see if I can wake up my neighbors, primary school classmates, primary school teachers, and the like." If you can't ... Then forget it!"The few of them were helpless.This job was really not easy.It all depended on luck!Li Hao didn't have any good ideas either. He smiled and said,""That's it. Actually, after recovering the later memories, the memories of childhood ... It's not a big deal to have a little less."Although he said that, his life was not complete enough.When he was young, he always had some unforgettable memories. If he lost them all, Li Hao would probably feel empty, right?The three of them thought to themselves, but none of them had any good ideas. Li Hao continued."That's just one of the reasons. Second, this time, I'll need the help of the Dao of life and death. I also need you to guide me! I will walk the real Dao and die, and walk the virtual Dao to live. In between, I will cross the river of time ... Now, it should be called the river of life and death, and I will live towards death ...""I'll form a closed loop and start my life anew!""The key is to receive life and death!"He looked at Lin Hongyu."What you have to do is actually not difficult. Use your life and death Star as the center point. When I cross this point, you can use the life and death Dao to gather my spirit and throw it into the river!"Lin Hongyu hesitated and asked,""At this time, you will be born like a baby?""Right!""Then ... Then wouldn't I be your mother?"Lin Hongyu couldn't help but blurt out, because what Li Hao asked her to do was ... Like giving birth!Walking into a life-and-death Star, using life-and-death as a boundary, and then throwing Li Hao into the river ... Wasn't this ... A delivery?I haven't become your wife yet, but I've become your mother?What was this?Li Hao was speechless!I'm cultivating!What was this woman thinking?However, strictly speaking, her thinking this way ... Was not without reason.Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang both lowered their heads and didn't say anything.This was not easy to follow up on!Li Hao rolled his eyes and was speechless. After a while, he said,""To walk through your life and death Star and then appear again is indeed ... Somewhat similar to giving birth! Of course, you can also change the form ...""How?" Lin Hongyu asked hurriedly. "You can treat the life and death Stars as your butt or your nostrils ... Do you understand?"“……”Silence.At this moment, the three of them were dumbfounded. What was this?Qian Wuliang was really embarrassed and didn't dare to laugh. Hong Yitang couldn't hold it in, but he was old and Lin Hongyu was his junior, so he held it in. However, Black Panther couldn't hold it in and his huge Chaos Beast body trembled.He really couldn't help it.Li Hao ... That's enough. In order to make Lin Hongyu feel at ease, he described himself as sh * t. Just think of it as picking your nose or pooping ... Then you won't have the illusion of childbirth!Lin Hongyu was helpless!This ... Was really disgusting.Sometimes, this guy's brain circuits simply made people speechless.However, after thinking about it carefully ... It seemed to make sense. However, when he thought about this scene in the future ... Did this fellow really not care about his image at all?"Forget it," she said helplessly."I'll just pretend that this didn't happen. These are all minor details. Other than that, what else do you need us to do?"Li Hao nodded,"yes ... I want to be a genius, a peerless genius!" When I was one year old, you all threw in the secret technique of five birds and then comprehended the force. When I was three years old, you all threw in the method of opening the aperture. When you were six, you cast the Holy prose technique. I want to cultivate the Holy prose and fuse it with the power ...""You're still so young, do you know how to?"Li Hao was speechless."I'm just starting over. I'm not a fool. Starting over means that I'm a natural-born, self-taught genius. I was born from the Dao! All I need is a primer, and I can learn it ..."Alright!The few of them were a little curious. Would this really work?If he could, it would simply be heaven-defying!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  "Oh right, this process will consume some energy ... But to you, it's not worth mentioning. After all, it's only the initial stage of cultivation! However, in the later stages, the consumption of energy will be very large ... At this time, you can put in the life force left behind by me after I passed away ..."The few of them kept nodding.This was everyone's first time trying something like this, so they were all very curious and a little nervous.Li Hao had been doing things that others didn't dare to do recently.It was easy to say, but what if ... He really died and could not live?"Do we need to inform the others?""No need!"Li Hao shook his head."It's only adding to my worries. Why should I worry?" It's just a normal training session. "Was it normal?It was not normal at all!How can you play like this!"All right, that's all. I'll be honest first. I'll consume my lifespan and die of old age ... If it's fast, it'll be over in a few days. If it's slow ... If it doesn't grow fast, it'll take eight to ten years ... Now, you have to be careful. The Scarlet Moon experts are chasing after you. During this period, the three of you won't be able to fight. So, Black Panther, you have to run for your life!"

2574 Chapter 428
The giant beast's body trembled, indicating that it understood.Li Hao couldn't help but curse,""You've already become the will of heaven, taking over heaven and earth, chaos beasts, and becoming venerable sovereigns, yet you still can't speak and transmit your voice. Do you think I'm an idiot?"“……” The three of them were stunned. That's right.Heibao, why can't you speak?He was already at the venerable sovereign level!This might be Silvermoon's first venerable sovereign in the truest sense ... Of course, it was a bit of a trick.The Black Panther's huge body trembled once again. It was clearly a cow, but it let out a weak dog bark."Woof!"“……”Li Hao facepalmed. He really didn't know what to do with it. This dog ... Must have a problem.Why aren't you saying anything?You've already become the will of the heavens!"There's a 99% chance that you have a child's voice. No one is mocking you!"Li Hao helplessly shook his head. Forget it.Embarrassed to see people, sorry, a dog actually also wants face. Forget it, do as you please."Let's go back to the Silver Moon ... The Stargate will be opened immediately. Black Panther, don't close the Stargate, or we'll lose contact with chaos."Soon, the four of them disappeared from the Black Panther.……Silvermoon.At this moment, the Silver Moon was slightly different from before. The Three Rivers ran through the Silver Moon, and the two rivers were like a circle that wrapped around the Silver Moon. The river of life and death was like a bridge that connected the two rivers.Li Hao was also very decisive in his actions.He did not say anything to the others. He returned to Silver Moon and stepped into the river of truth. Using the connection point between the illusory and corporeal paths as a starting point, he stepped in. The river water flowed over his head as he walked forward, and his body instantly aged.He was supposed to be this old.At this moment, after being washed by the water of chaos and the power of 10000 DAOs, he returned to his original form and revealed his old appearance for the first time. He was truly old, and even his face was wrinkled.His body also had a rotten aura.As Li Hao entered, the three experts gradually noticed something different. Cracks appeared on Li Hao's body, as if he had been pieced together like a broken doll.This was Li Hao's nature.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  He was resurrected again and again, and died again and again ... At this moment, he was like a doll that was being sewn together, or a Broken Porcelain.The cracks were shocking to see!Li Hao didn't notice anything unusual, but the situation was actually this serious?At this moment, a few more people appeared between heaven and earth. One was Tian Ji, another was Yuan Shuo, and the last one was ermao ... At this moment, ermao was not immersed in it, but appeared between heaven and earth. Not long after, Zhang an also appeared. They were all shocked when they saw the old Li Hao.How did this happen?They didn't know what was going on, so they didn't dare to disturb him. They could only watch Li Hao grow older and older as he walked from one end of the river of truth to another.Heaven's Fate was a little puzzled and looked at Zhang an. Zhang an also shook his head.He didn't understand either!The current Li Hao had come into contact with three great Dao universes, fought with powerful venerable sovereigns, controlled time, fought with the chaos lightning tribulation, and experienced the new martial era ...The current Li Hao's knowledge and vision were not inferior to anyone.On the other hand, second cat seemed to have noticed something.Of all the people present, the one who had seen the most was not the celestial pole or Zhang an, but this one. It looked at the sky for a while before lying still in the void. It was just a little curious and a little puzzled.Did it have to be like this?He could also become a venerable sovereign through normal means. After becoming a venerable sovereign, some of his injuries would also disappear. Of course, it might not be as good as what he was doing now, but it was still dangerous.He really didn't care about his life.There was confusion in its eyes, as if it had thought of something. It thought of that person ... The one who taught.He also liked to study some messy things.He always liked to be immersed in his own world. Nothing in the world seemed to be able to shake him. Until ... There was nothing in the world that was worth his nostalgia. Then, he would feel that it was boring.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked even older. He was walking in the river of chaos with slow steps.Step by step, he walked towards the end of his life.Gradually, his aura began to weaken, and he began to rot. He gasped for breath, then looked up and smiled. By this point, his teeth had all fallen out.It turns out that when I'm old, even cultivators ... Will be like this?I thought that when cultivators die of old age, their golden bodies would remain undamaged and passed on for eternity!The power of the great Dao in his body gradually merged into the long river. He didn't bring life with him, and he didn't take death with him. The cycle of life and death had come naked, so he should leave naked.The clothes on his body turned into dust.In the air, Lin Hongyu's face did not turn red. She just looked at Li Hao, who was covered in cracks, in silence. At this moment, no one knew what she was thinking. After living another life, did Li Hao...Still remember everything?Who knows?At this moment, Li Hao had already reached the end of the river. The river of life and death was like a bridge that stretched across the world.Li Hao panted heavily, his breathing rapid.He felt a little suffocated, and his vision was a little dark. He laughed at himself. It was really tragic to be old. He couldn't hear the sounds outside, couldn't see the scene in front of him, and even his body didn't seem to belong to him.All the powerhouses who were observing this scene felt a little sad.Cultivators at Li Hao's level would also ... Age like this?So weak?

2575 Chapter 428
Even the celestial pole was a little frightened at this moment. Would a day like this come for venerable sovereigns?He was powerful and unparalleled when he was alive, but would he be like this when he was old?He had never seen a real powerhouse at the end of his life. Under normal circumstances, when the decline of the strong arrived, they would go out to look for opportunities. They would either break through to the next realm or ... Be killed!No one would watch themselves die of old age!At this moment, Li Hao, with great difficulty, stepped onto the bridge ... With a boom, it was as if the world had collapsed!Li Hao's body completely rotted. Like a pool of mud, it instantly turned into powder and was washed away by the river.At this moment, a resplendent vitality condensed into a ball of light, which was the foundation of Li Hao's life. This ball of light started moving on the bridge.The few people who didn't know before were all shocked!However, no one spoke.They knew what Li Hao was doing.It was just that ... Such a method seemed very dangerous.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  At this moment, Heaven's Fate finally understood and muttered,""Life and death ... Yin and yang?"Yin and yang were not like this!The human King reversed yin and yang and resurrected people directly, not starting over. Li Hao ... Seemed to be walking the true cycle of life and death!This guy, even if he were to lose time, he was still not willing to take the normal path?This man ... Was really audacious!The ball of light moved slowly on the bridge towards a black and white star in the middle of the bridge. Lin Hongyu was not even breathing on the star.At her level, she didn't need to breathe.However, at this moment, he felt suffocated.Li Hao ... Will he succeed?Little by little, the light approached the life and death Star.Gradually, it started to touch the black half.A wave of death Qi spread out and infected that ray of light, dyeing the ball of light black. The ball of light was still moving, as if it was very difficult.Little by little ... Everyone was so nervous that they were suffocating.Suddenly, the ball of light approached the boundary between life and death.Lin Hongyu was so nervous that her hands were trembling. She clenched her fists tightly. When the ball of light approached the boundary between black and white, she shouted in a low voice. The stars trembled violently. At this moment, she could not care about giving birth or picking her nose. She was not in the mood to think about it.A ball of light was jolted out by her and instantly fell into the river of life and death.A wave of vitality overflowed.In the next moment, a cry resounded through the world, as if the world had been reborn. In this instant, the entire Silver Moon suddenly turned from winter to spring. All living things came back to life, and countless plants began to grow along with the cries of babies.The ice and snow melted, and spring arrived.In the long river, a baby was swimming in the river with a bare bottom. His eyes were exceptionally bright, and his cries were particularly loud."Waa waa waa ..."Lin Hongyu was extremely nervous. She was a little breathless as she looked at the baby, not knowing what to do. At this moment, second cat, who had been silent the entire time, suddenly said,"Meow ... A real Xiantian body ... He's so bold!"The baby in the river, on the other hand, began to grow. When he was thirsty, he would drink the water of the river. When he was sleepy, he would float above the river and sleep.At this moment ... Suddenly, a ray of light flashed.In the distance, Yuan Shuo remained silent. A camera appeared in his hand, and he took a photo ...Everyone was stunned!Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, had a calm expression.At this moment, the others looked at each other. The next moment, Zhang an remained silent. The book of Dao appeared and directly reflected the river. He felt that ... Taking photos was too low-end. It was better to ... Imprint the book of Dao directly!How interesting!Li Hao had actually become a baby!What was this?Meanwhile, Heaven's Fate dug his nose and started recording silently. The others looked at each other ... Lin Hongyu suddenly laughed and started recording as well.Seeing this, Hong Yitang didn't want to be left out.Only one person, Qian Wuliang, looked around and swallowed his saliva, not daring to move.I'm afraid of death!These people were crazy!This man was not someone to be trifled with. If he were to awaken later and become a venerable sovereign ... Once they found out about all this, these fellows would really not be afraid of death!After a while, everyone saw the baby grow up."How ... How do we determine his age?" Lin Hongyu suddenly asked.He's so young, and I've never had a child before. How would I know when he's a year old?This guy was not an ordinary child at all!"Let's look at the root bone!"Heaven's Fate was able to make a judgment and quickly said,""He's growing up so fast. What's going on ... He's almost a year old ...""Already a year old!" He immediately said.Lin Hongyu quickly threw a book down. It was like the text of the great Dao.In the river, the child had already swum into The Phantom Dao River, and the book instantly fell into his body. The child's eyes flickered, as if he had understood something, and he actually mumbled,""Five birds and five Forces, five elements and five DAOs ...",m Suddenly, Shi appeared on his body!This time, the speed of his comprehension was simply unimaginable. In an instant, five types of major forces floated above his head. They did not take the shape of beasts, but directly transformed into the power of the five elements. The power of the five elements instantly merged and suddenly merged into a domain!Yuan Shuo opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he didn 't.F * ck!What was this?Was Li Hao cultivating with the power of a half-Emperor, or was he really starting from scratch? if it was the latter ... Wouldn't it be too terrifying?In just an instant, the tiny infant grew a little. There was no other power in his body except for the five Grand forces that fused into a domain. It was like the embryonic form of the world was beginning to merge.

"Quick, continue with your cultivation technique ..." Tian Ji quickly reminded him.By now, Lin Hongyu could actually tell his age. She was also shocked by Li Hao's rapid growth. She didn't dare to say anything more and focused on the Enlightenment method again.This time, it was also shocking.All of a sudden, the apertures on Li Hao's body lit up. In the blink of an eye, 36 apertures appeared, and in the blink of an eye ... 72!p Everyone was dumbfounded!He didn't know if Li Hao was cultivating with the power of a half-Emperor, or if this reborn child was really a genius.He broke through the ten decapitation realm instantly.In just a moment, he broke through 100.Not long after, that little Li Hao reached the thousand-man warrior level ...All of a sudden, a Dao Meridian was completely activated at the mountain and sea level!As this Dao Meridian was activated, the next moment, the power of void Dao instantly appeared and transformed into a great force. A Dao Meridian emerged from the void Dao River and merged with it. Everyone was shocked when they saw it.From the very beginning, was it a fusion of reality and illusion?This ... Was so fast!At this moment, Hong Yitang suddenly said,""How do I awaken his memory? he's almost six years old ..."Lin Hongyu did not know either. She quickly told the child Li Hao many things, all of which Li Hao had said before. However, the child Li Hao did not respond at all. He was like a vegetable and did not care at all.Lin Hongyu was helpless. If this continued, Li Hao would lose his memory before he was six years old.On the other hand, Yuan Shuo suddenly laughed, and under everyone's surprised gazes, he suddenly jumped into The Phantom Dao River.Qian Wuliang was shocked!Would something happen?In the next moment, Yuan Shuo grabbed the bald child Li Hao and smacked him on the butt. He shouted angrily,""You dare to do bad things again!""Waa ..."The next moment, the child Li Hao suddenly cried,""I don't dare to ... Don't fight anymore ...""Little Hao knows his mistake ... He won't dare to ..."Yuan Shuo nodded his head in satisfaction and instantly retreated out of the river.Everyone looked at him in shock.Yuan Shuo's face was calm."Children are useless if they're not beaten up. There's no child in any family who hasn't been beaten up. This is simple. Beat him up and he'll come to his senses!"Was it like this?Lin Hongyu's heart skipped a beat. So that was the case.He had to be beaten up!At this moment, Li Hao was still growing rapidly in the river. His eyes were more active than before. Everyone knew that he had recovered his childhood memories.It was really ... A strange way of awakening.Li Hao's strength was also growing rapidly. As he put in one cultivation technique after another, Li Hao's strength reached the sun Moon tier in the blink of an eye, which was stunning.He also opened more and more Dao meridians!The next moment, he was ten years old. It was time for his second memory awakening. This time, Yuan Shuo didn't need to do anything. Lin Hongyu appeared instantly, grabbed the bald Li Hao, and slapped him!The child, Li Hao, cursed,""Bad woman, why did you hit me? I'm going to tell my dad ..."   Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  “……”Lin Hongyu was stunned.Memory recovery ... It can't be like this, right?Yuan Shuo sighed. Have you never raised a child before?This group of people ... Why were they all acting like idiots?Although I don't have any children, I ... Have really raised one before!At this moment, Yuan Shuo reappeared in front of Li Hao in an instant. He said imposingly,""How many marks did you get on the exam? Was he the last in class again? If you don't do well, you're not allowed to eat tonight!"“……”Everyone around was stunned. Would this work?In the next moment, the child Li Hao seemed to be startled. He said nervously,"the ... The test results ... Are not out ...""You still dare to lie? I've already asked your teacher!""I ... I won't dare to do it again ..."The child, Li Hao, was already a sun Moon cultivator, but he was so terrified that he turned around and tried to escape. However, he was caught by Yuan Shuo and slapped on his butt again!"I won't do it next time!"Wailing sounds once again resounded throughout the world.Everyone looked at Yuan Shuo in a daze ... Was it that simple?Yuan Shuo backed out of the river once again. Seeing the crowd looking at him, he remained calm. What did he know? this was the true fear in the depths of Li Hao's heart. Exams were so scary!Everyone was speechless. Meanwhile, Li Hao continued to swim in the river.Gradually, his strength grew stronger and stronger.He began to step into the daomerge!Dao integration stage one, stage two ...His speed was unimaginably fast.This time, Lin Hongyu took the initiative and said,""I'll be the one to wake you up when you're 16 ..."This time, she felt that she had experience!It turned out that taking care of a child was like this. It was very simple.She was full of confidence. The next moment, when Li Hao turned 16, she instantly jumped into the river and grabbed Li Hao, imposingly saying,"How did you do in the exam?"Bang! Bang!Li Hao's punch, which had the power of a sixth-level Dao integration realm cultivator, was so powerful that Lin Hongyu's face was swollen!Lin Hongyu was stunned.How could this be?The next moment, Yuan Shuo stepped into the river and said,""Li Hao, are you in a relationship? Tell me, who is the girl? is she in love with her or is there something else?"The teenager, Li Hao, was slightly stunned and embarrassed. He seemed to have thought of something and said in a low voice,""Don't ... Don't tell my mom ..."The crowd looked at each other ...

Lin Hongyu was helpless!Forget it, I don't understand!Yuan Shuo, this old Bachelor, was quite knowledgeable. He was indeed a professor.At this moment, Li Hao's memory seemed to have been awakened again. His eyes were even more brilliant, and his strength had improved again.At this moment, his age was still increasing.However, there was no need for others to awaken his memories.After he turned 16, Li Hao seemed to have realized something. His eyes were sometimes filled with sorrow, sometimes with anger, and sometimes with despair.At this moment, everyone understood that he had awakened.Meanwhile, Li Hao's strength increased rapidly.Soon after, his aura changed to the ninth level of Dao integration!At this moment, Li Hao reached his previous peak."Hu!"Li Hao let out a breath and looked around. He seemed to be able to see through the river and see everyone."I'm going to vindicate Dao!"Li Hao looked at the crowd. His eyes returned to normal, but his body was as good as new.This time, it seemed much easier.However, everyone's expression was grave.How do you vindicate Dao?I can't tell!At this moment, two stars, one black and one white, appeared above Li Hao's head. Everyone was stunned. Life and death Stars?The two stars gradually began to merge and dominated the other stars. The Dao of the stars emerged in Li Hao's body, and he stepped into the river of time and space.Above his head, life and death were intertwined.Li Hao smiled."It's actually not difficult to die. What's difficult is to recover my memories perfectly. Teacher, you really understand me!""Why didn't you wake me up?" Yuan Shuo laughed."I thought that my teacher wouldn't understand either. After all ... My teacher is single ..."Yuan Shuo sneered,"I've done everything in my life. A long time ago, I was the Dean of an orphanage for seven years in order to excavate historical sites ... I know what you're thinking the moment you stick out your butt!" Oh right, don't you feel embarrassed putting on your clothes!"Li Hao was dazed for a moment, then chuckled. The next moment, a green robe appeared on his body.On the other side, Lin Hongyu looked away indifferently. 'Since everyone is looking ... What's the harm in me looking?'At this moment, Li Hao coughed, looked at the sky, and smiled.""Venerable sovereigns are that simple. However, when I walk the path of life and death, there should be a lightning tribulation, a chaos lightning tribulation, but it won't be too powerful ... We're all old acquaintances. Watch me break it!"As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed out of the sky.In the chaos, as expected, a dark cloud that was not too strong appeared.Compared to before, the difference was huge.   BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Strictly speaking, it was similar to the time when Li Hao, Li daoheng, and the others were struck to death. However, all three of them had been struck to death.In fact, it was still quite powerful.But to Li Hao ... This was nothing.At this moment, a longsword appeared in Li Hao's hand. Life and death rotated in his hand. In an instant, he charged into the chaos and slashed out. The Dao of life and death appeared, commanding the 360 Dao meridians as one. With a slash, half of the dark clouds were destroyed with a BOOM!The crowd also quickly walked out, all somewhat shocked.So strong?In the next moment, an even more powerful force burst out of Li Hao's body. It was another sword attack. Life and death as one. The dark clouds seemed to feel threatened. They trembled and instantly turned into death Qi, and then vitality in the blink of an eye.Life and death continued to intertwine, and the dark clouds seemed to be experiencing birth, aging, illness, and death ... They kept changing with life and death.Li Hao slashed down again, and the Tribulation cloud that had killed bone and the others was cut open!Everyone was dumbfounded!How could this be?BOOM!The lightning tribulation dissipated immediately!As for Li Hao, he opened his mouth and swallowed the destructive power of the lightning tribulation. Li Hao landed on the giant beast and instantly sat cross-legged with stars above his head.At this moment, his aura suddenly became stronger.Black and white intertwined for a while, and a wave of pressure appeared out of thin air. Even the giant beast body held by the Black Panther trembled violently. The Black Panther actually felt an extremely great threat!"Time is better than life and death!"Li Hao opened his eyes and shook his head regretfully.He was indeed inferior!The life and death monarch might be stronger than ordinary monarchs, but he was definitely not as strong as the time monarch. What a pity!The surrounding crowd looked at each other and fell into a dead silence.Suddenly, everyone wanted to beat him to death. As for the celestial pole, it was extremely quiet at this moment. He didn't say a word. He cursed inwardly."I'm here in person ... Can I defeat him?"It should ... Be possible?Was it so easy to prove one's Dao as a venerable sovereign?Why didn't I notice it!Of course, Li Hao had killed several venerable sovereigns before, so it wasn't hard to understand. However, the celestial pole still felt a little uncomfortable that he had mastered the Dao of life and death so easily this time.I've never been jealous of others, but this time ... I'm really a little jealous.Even human Kings couldn't corroborate their Dao so quickly, right?How long has it been!

Chapter 2578 Setting Off (1)
As Li Hao said, it would not be too difficult for him to become a venerable Emperor if he chose another Dao, even if it was the Dao of life and death.Of course, that was only to him.A normal person ... Could not do it.The cycle of life and death was almost impossible. Secondly, the chaos lightning tribulation was nothing special to Li Hao. He had transcended many tribulations, and the chaos lightning tribulation seemed to have been born for him.However, under normal circumstances, even a newly advanced venerable sovereign would find it difficult to withstand such a lightning tribulation.But under Li Hao's sword ... They were like tofu.,m Just these two points were enough to shatter the fantasies of the others.Venerable sovereigns of life and death were no ordinary venerable sovereigns. Anyone who could provoke a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation was no ordinary being. Therefore, everyone was very envious.Even if Li Hao was not happy about it ... The entire Silver Moon seemed to be cheering for him.At this moment, everyone was gathered together.A veteran powerhouse like Zhang an, who had yet to reach the venerable sovereign level, was even more envious. He was even a little dazed when he looked at Li Hao's slightly young face.Li Hao was almost 22 years old. According to him, opening a Stargate was a new calendar. In fact, he was already 22 years old.Zhang an thought for a moment. The human King would become a venerable Emperor, unify the world ... And even become an extraordinary top venerable Emperor. In fact, it wasn't that big of a possibility. It was possible that ... He was a little younger than Li Hao.The human King entered the Academy at the age of 18 and almost unified the world three years later.However, the era of the human King was different from this era.Li Hao had truly become the king of this era.Venerable Emperor of life and death!Li Hao had only officially stepped into the first level of martial arts at the age of 20.All sorts of thoughts emerged.At this moment, the giant beast was still moving in the chaos. Zhang an asked,""Li Hao, the Dao of life and death and the Dao of yin and yang are completely different in your eyes? Is life and death more powerful, or is yin and yang more powerful?"As soon as he said this, the others, including Heaven's Fate, were instantly interested.They were actually very curious!The human King should be considered the Yin Yang Thearch, right?Of course, these top existences had many great DAOs, but there were still some top great DAOs as the foundation. The neo martial world where the human King was located was the yin-yang world. It could be seen what was the master of this world.The human King had completed the reversal of yin and yang when he killed the heavenly Emperor. He resurrected the experts who had died in battle, opened up the yin and yang realms, and completed the energy transformation within the macro world.However, the Dao of life and death also sounded very powerful. Seeing that everyone was interested, Li Hao smiled and said,""There are thousands of great DAOs, but they're all about the same. As for who's stronger, doesn't it still depend on the level of your application and cultivation?"This answer clearly did not satisfy everyone."Of course!" Li Hao added."There are also profound DAOs!"As the youngest cultivator present, it was Li Hao who was preaching to everyone. It was strange how strong and weak the doctrine of universal nature was.But indeed, Li Hao's comprehension of Dao was probably the deepest among them."Let's talk about life and death and yin and yang ..."Li Hao thought for a while and said,"yin and yang are two sides of the spectrum, hard and soft at the same time!" By reversing yin and yang, neo martial could resurrect everyone. In fact, it was not resurrection ... It was reversing from extreme yang to extreme Yin! Then, with extreme Yin, cultivate extreme yang, and return to yang!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "As for life and death ... The Dao of life and death doesn't actually have the ability to resurrect!"Everyone was stunned. Life and death actually couldn't resurrect people."The greatest characteristic of the Dao of life and death is the collision of the origin and the end ..." Li Hao continued.Heaven's Fate couldn't help but say,"say something that we can understand. Say it in a straightforward manner. The kind that is more straightforward!"“……”Li Hao was speechless. He could only continue."Simply put, let's talk about the means of attack. The way of life and death lies in two points. The first is to extract vitality! Accelerated aging ... It seemed similar to the Dao of time, but it was also different. The Dao of life and death was only useful for life, not for objects! I can let venerable sovereigns die of old age, but I can't let their weapons rot ... And time actually includes life and death. Whether it's people or things, they can age together, and with the passage of time, even weapons can become scrap iron!""Second, the power of life can be extracted. Of course, the power of death can also be extracted ... You can extract the death Qi from a dying person while he's still breathing ... You can also inject the death Qi into him to kill him!"It sounded simple, but after some thought, everyone still felt that it was a little scary.It could extract vitality and inject death Qi, which could make venerable sovereigns enter the aging stage. It was quite terrifying.It was very difficult for venerable sovereigns to grow old.But from Li Hao's words, he should be able to do it."Can't yin and yang work?"Li Hao shook his head."No... Of course, as long as you're strong enough, any Dao can work. If you're strong enough, you can catch a venerable sovereign and kill him with one strike. It's the same as death!" Be it yin and yang or life and death, they all have their own characteristics. But for now, the Dao of yin and yang simply reversing yin and yang to revive the dead is actually very powerful!"When Heaven's Fate heard this, he didn't say anything more. Many people in neo martial arts didn't understand the great Dao very well. Anyway, everyone had become venerable sovereigns and insisted on their own Dao. They didn't have much insight into other great Dao."Then ... Do you think you can defeat the giant beast if you fight it alone?" he asked immediately.He only knew that he should be slightly stronger than this giant beast.However, he was not as good as Red Moon sovereign.

Chapter 2579 Setting Off (2)
He was actually at the peak of level two venerable sovereigns, but he hadn't reached level three. Of course, that had been many years ago, but that was only relative. He had only been in the chaosverse for a little over fifty years.However, the progress of a neo martial expert who went on conquests shouldn't be slow.Now, if he was lucky, his original body should not be weaker than Red Moon sovereign.He wanted to know if Li Hao, who had advanced in the Dao of life and death, could quickly reach this level.Hearing this, Li Hao smiled but didn't reply.Tian Ji was stunned. He quickly understood and cursed.è‰¹!Can you really match him? Li Hao didn't say anything. Second cat, who had been silent all this time, mumbled,""He definitely can ... Before he advanced, he could already deal with an ordinary venerable sovereign. Now that he has officially entered the venerable sovereign level, the Dao of life and death is not simple!"While everyone was surprised, they were also excited.To Silver Moon, the birth of a venerable sovereign, and a rather strong one at that, would benefit the entire Silver Moon.Moreover, Li Hao had become a venerable sovereign very quickly. This time, he had started from scratch. He was at his peak. He was not weak, decayed, or aged. His body was now the youngest and most perfect body.Li Hao would make even greater progress in the future."How will you improve after you become a venerable sovereign?" Yuan Shuo asked. So far, not all venerable sovereigns are the same, there are strong and weak ..."Li Hao said, for now, it's better to strengthen the path of life and death! At the same time, he would continue to strengthen his other great DAOs and undergo a cultivation upgrade as a whole. However, under such circumstances, it was very difficult for a single transformation to occur! If I want to complete the transformation, it's best to cultivate more great DAOs. For example, I can cultivate yin and yang again. Next time, with the integration of yin and yang as the foundation, I can drive the entire River of great DAOs to progress and complete the second transformation ...""The second transformation?" celestial pole asked. Is it similar to Red Moon sovereign?""No, he didn't complete it!"Li Hao shook his head."The Dao of life and death. If I'm stronger, I should be able to match that guy!" The transformation I'm talking about isn't his kind, it's a higher level of transformation!"Heaven's Fate's heart stirred.Looking at Zhang an, Zhang an's eyes flickered.""In the chaotic world, we don't know much about the specific division of venerable sovereigns. However, when I was wandering in another macro world, I heard that venerable sovereigns should also be divided into several major stages ... Generally, the limit of the Lord of a small world, the limit of the Lord of a medium world, and the limit of the Lord of a major world are divided into three major stages!" "The transformation you're talking about ... The second transformation should be stepping into the level of a medium cosmos absolute being, or even the ultimate transformation ..."Li Hao nodded and said thoughtfully,"venerable sovereigns comprehend Dao into their bodies. Even the chaos beasts are actually a kind of Dao. The Dao of the physical body!" In terms of large, medium, and small worlds, it could indeed be divided into three stages ... Each stage had a difference in strength! The Beast of Chaos and red Moon sovereign should be in the first stage. Bone erosion should also be in the first stage ...""In that case, there hasn't been any transformation so far. The first stage can be generally divided into three levels!"Li Hao also took a deep breath and thought, it seems that the gap between venerable sovereigns is not small! From the words of the seniors, senior Empyrean pole is most likely in the first stage, and people like the blood Emperor are most likely in the second stage. As for the human king and emperor Cang, they might be in the third stage!"Neo martial was really not weak.In new martial arts, besides Emperor Cang and the human King, it was said that the sun god had also stepped into this level. There was also the heavenly Emperor who was killed in the past ... Of course, that was back then. It was unknown whether the heavenly Emperor was in the second or third stage.In short, he was not someone that Li Hao could match.The gap was still huge!Putting aside neo martial for the time being, the key was the Crimson Moon world!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  This was also an existence that could rival or even surpass neo martial in a macro world ... If silver Moon and red Moon met, the other party would not be polite. He had already killed two of their venerable sovereigns!At present, the experts in the first stage, such as the red moon sovereign, him, Black Panther, two masters of the great Dao, and two cats ... Should not be so difficult to deal with them now. He was confident that he could kill them again.However, if a stage two expert came ... It would be different. There was a high probability that he would be difficult to match."We know too little about chaos!"Li Hao looked at the endless void and frowned.""I can't find a new martial artist now ... So, it's best to find a relatively friendly chaos Ranger who's not very strong and understand some things! At the very least, I know some basic things. "Now, everything depended on guessing.Most importantly, it would be troublesome if they entered a large world while drifting randomly.He turned to the others."Let's not talk about anything else. Now that the Silvermoon world has advanced, I have perfected some of the Dao of life and death. Uncle Hong, Hong Yu, Qian Wuliang, the three of you have a great chance of becoming venerable sovereigns."The three of them looked at each other, but they didn't feel anything.Li Hao continued, Hong Yu won't say anything, but you can try to comprehend the life and death Stars I condensed earlier. Of course, since you've become a venerable sovereign, you might also be a venerable sovereign of the Dao of life and death ... But you should be a little weaker than me. Your Foundation is not as deep as mine!"
