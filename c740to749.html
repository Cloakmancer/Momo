        special people like hou Xiaochen, Hao lianchuan was probably the strongest in terms of pure superpowers.
        That's right, for example, Hu dingfang, who had turned from a Martial Master to a super.
        Wang Henggang, Martial Master to super.
        Hong Yitang, Martial Master to super.
        Out of all the three suns powerhouses in Silver Moon, only Hao lianchuan was a pure super. He was not even a god tier master and had only cultivated his powers.
        Tsunami frowned,"I've never heard of any big demon appearing in the Cang mountains. If there is, why is the Silver Moon so close to us? why is there no movement at all?" There are some great demons in the North Sea. I've seen a great demon that seems to have turned into a whale spirit with my own eyes. It's extremely powerful, but it doesn't have much killing intent. Only the three suns have tried to attack it, but they couldn't even break through its defense. It's at least a great demon at the sunguang level. "
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The so-called great demon, those who had not reached the three yang realm did not have the right to call it that.
        When it came to the three suns and the rising sun, they would be called great demons.
        "Li Hao actually ran into the Cang mountains ..."
        Tsunami frowned. As a Water-type superpower, she didn't like mountains and plains. She preferred places with water.
         However, the impact wasn't too great.
        Banshan stared at Cang Shan for a while and said,""Li Hao is from the silver Blizzard city, and the Cang mountains are nearby. He should be familiar with the Cang mountains, so it's understandable that he fled here. However ... If I really encounter a great demon, I will leave ... If there's one, there might be a second. It's not a good thing to be entangled here."
        Tsunami frowned and didn't speak.
        This Banshan was as timid as a mouse!
        The people of Fei Tian were used to walking in the dark and couldn't see the light!
        "Alright, I know!"
        Tsunami no longer said anything. He stepped forward and stepped into the Cang Mountain territory.
        Li Hao and the other martial masters didn't feel it, but as a superhuman, she felt it the moment she stepped into the Cang mountains. The mysterious energy here was very rich, which surprised her. She felt that it was stronger than many provinces.
        But why were there not many people from the Silver Moon that would enter the Cang mountains to cultivate?
        Behind him, Banshan also walked in.
        At this moment, Banshan also felt it.
        Tsunami's doubts were also directly asked,""Even if silver Moon doesn't want to travel to other provinces, the Cang mountains are not bad. Why doesn't anyone come here to cultivate their superpowers? At the very least, he's stronger than Silver Moon. "
        Banshan did not say anything.
        When tsunami turned back to look at him, Banshan frowned,""I don't know. Maybe someone has entered the Cang mountains before. I've never been here before. The people who came either cultivated in secret, or ... They didn't return. "
        The first possibility did exist, but it was nothing much.
        The second one ... Even tsunami's expression changed slightly.
        He didn't return!
        That's right, if all the supers who entered died and none of them returned, then naturally no one would know that the mysterious energy was very rich in the Cang mountains.
        This time, even tsunami was a little flustered by his words.
        However, he quickly felt relieved and smiled."It's fine if we can't go back. The Silver Moon is too rare and weak. Even the three suns are extremely rare. Those who enter the Cang mountains are probably only starlight Masters and moon underworld Masters. What's our strength?"
        The rising light!
        Even in the central region, he was a top expert.  Would they be afraid of a border mountain?
        Banshan didn't say anything more. Instead, he landed on the ground and examined carefully.
        Martial masters didn't have any mysterious abilities, so it was hard to track them down. This place was also full of trees and jungles, and the mountain peaks blocked their line of sight. It would be difficult to find Li Hao here.
        However, there were many of them, so there would be some traces left behind.
        After checking, he locked onto the direction and began to move forward.
        However, Banshan raised his head and looked into the distance. Looking at the mysterious and dark depths of the mountain, he frowned slightly. The Cang Mountain...There shouldn't be any powerful monsters, right?
        It wasn't a big problem if a Martial Master didn't show his superpowers.
        However, unless there was a treasure to hide it, there would always be some fluctuations of supernatural powers and mysterious energy fluctuations. And demons could clearly sense the fluctuations of mysterious energy.
        ……
        At the same time.
        Looking down from the sky, the Cang Mountain range was like a dragon in the deep abyss, or a water channel, overlapping with each other.
        They were like giant Dragons lying on the ground.
        About a hundred miles away from Li Hao's group, over many mountains ...
        At this moment, in a small valley, there was a small lake in the middle of the mountain. The surface of the lake was extremely calm, and there was a Green Lotus swaying in the air.
        Around the lake, there was a fierce tiger crouching.
        Opposite the Tiger, a huge snake was circling.
        On the other side of the lake, a Golden Eagle landed on a tree. On the other side, a giant ape had golden hair on its head.
        There were birds of prey in all directions.
        At this moment, it was extremely quiet. There was no movement at all, and no one was interfering. It was as if they were waiting for something, or as if they were expecting something.
        In the middle of the lake, the green Lotus seemed to be budding.
        Vaguely, some Golden Lotus seeds were revealed in the middle.
         These Golden Lotus seeds were faintly discernible, and every time they appeared, the ferocious birds would become slightly agitated.
        At this moment, a Goshawk circled in the sky.
        It was huge!
        The goshawk screeched, and the Golden Condor that was standing on the tree suddenly raised its head. A sharp glint appeared in its sharp eyes.
        The goshawks were the eyes on the outskirts of the Cang mountains.
        At this moment, the goshawk was chirping, indicating that there was a human invasion.
        However, the Golden Condor glanced at the green Lotus in the middle of the lake. Its originally Restless Heart suddenly calmed down and did not move.
        The giant snake, giant ape, and Tiger were also extremely quiet, as if they had not heard the goshawk's cry.
        If it was a normal day, it might not be like this.
        However, at this moment, none of the ferocious birds were willing to leave.
       
        A moment later, the Golden Eagle screeched. Its voice was particularly sharp and deep. In the sky, the goshawk flew away and stopped circling.
        The giant ape smacked the ground, causing the ground to shake.
        ,m The few ferocious birds looked at the giant ape. The giant ape revealed a human-like gloominess and continued to lie on the ground, no longer pounding the ground.  The four birds of prey seemed to have intelligence.
        At this moment, they were guarding this small lake, unwilling to leave.
        ……
        At the same time.
        Li Hao seemed to have heard a sound. He looked up and vaguely saw some shadows flying too high. However, Li Hao noticed something unusual. Balls of light!
        In the air, the bird of prey flying extremely high seemed to have a ball of light, but the strength was too far away to be seen clearly.
        However, for him to be able to see it from so far away, it was obvious that the bird of prey in the air was not weak.
         There was indeed a demon!
        Li Hao took a deep breath. He had only come to the Cang Mountain because he felt that the mountain was huge, with many trees and mountains, and it would be difficult for superpowers to find them.
        But at this moment, not long after he entered, he seemed to have already seen two demons.
        "Everyone, cover your bodies with some leaves ..."
        Li Hao reminded her. Birds actually had very good vision.
        If you were moving underground, the other party might be able to see you.
        Of course, they weren't superpowers, so the other party might not care. However, the less trouble they had, the better. They didn't know how strong the bird in the sky was. If it suddenly landed and attacked them, it would be troublesome.
        At this moment, Li Hao didn't know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing to enter the Cang mountains.
        Let's just take it one step at a time.
        The group continued to move. They were all covered in leaves. This place lacked everything except for these. The pitch-black armor, the dark night, and the lack of superpower waves. Li Hao could see the orbs of light, so he avoided them, regardless of their size. Thus, the group moved smoothly.
        ……
        They were successful.
        However, the tsunami and the mountain weren't so smooth.
        Tsunami shot a water arrow and killed a Python that suddenly fell down. He frowned slightly and said in a deep voice,""These monsters are extremely weak and only have some basic instincts ... They actually dare to attack us. Can't they feel the threat we bring?"
        She and Banshan had already been attacked several times along the way.
        There were snakes, birds, beasts, leopards ...
        They were all very weak, and some were even pure wild beasts.
        However, these guys actually dared to attack them. Did they not feel the danger?  There was no danger, but it was troublesome to be attacked all the time, and it would delay their pursuit.
        Banshan didn't say anything and only looked around. After a long time, he said,""There might be a great demon in the mountains. Tsunami, this place ... Is not suitable for staying for long! We seem to be being watched. These small demons were only ordered by the greater Demon to attack us. "
        Tsunami smiled,"I have some feelings ... But, what are you afraid of?" Even if there are greater demons, this fellow doesn't dare to appear by himself. Instead, he commands these weaker demons to attack us. Are you expecting some Starlight or Dark Moon demons to harm us? To consume us?"
        "If that's the case, then that big demon ... Is nothing more than this. The three suns have overestimated it!"
        "If that's the case, there might be some unexpected gains."
        As for the unexpected gains?
        Usually, where there were great demons, there would be treasures. There were either a large number of divine energy stones buried, some relics from the ancient civilization, or some natural treasures.
        Some of these demons were born from the birth of these natural treasures.
        As tsunami spoke, he laughed again."I heard that there are some great demons in the central region that even guard some historical sites. There are few people in the Cang mountains, but there might be strong cultivators in seclusion here during the ancient civilization. We might even encounter some ancient civilization dojos."
        Banshan frowned.
        This tsunami was really greedy.
        He was a cautious person. In fact, he had wanted to run away when he was attacked by these demons. It would be best if he could kill Li Hao, but if he couldn 't, it would be fine.
        Two of the Yama's three suns had died, but it was best not to rashly enter unknown and dangerous place like the Cang mountains.
        Tsunami saw that he was silent and was a little annoyed.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A suguang-level expert was hesitating because of the attacks of a few weak demons. After such a long time, Li Hao and the others might have run far away.
        "Banshan is just a weak little demon who has just become a spirit!"
        "If it really dares to come, I'll kill it. If it has any treasures to protect, they're all yours!" Tsunami was a little annoyed.
         Banshan did not say anything. He squatted down again to check for clues.
        After a while, he walked in a certain direction.
        He chose to continue, but he also had his own thoughts. He could only stay here for three days at most. After three days, he would leave. He couldn't stay for too long, and this was only the outer area of the Cang mountains.
        Who knew if Li Hao's group would run deeper?
        ……
        Not long after tsunami and the others left, the reincarnation King brought a group of three suns with colorful faces and quickly followed.
        The Samsara King was very fast. He checked on the giant snake that had just been killed and frowned slightly."There are so many monsters in the Cang mountains. It seems that there is something special about this place, or some small divine power mine might have been born."
        Most of the divine power stones were in the ruins.
        However, some people had discovered that some divine power stones buried underground were similar to mineral veins, but there were very few of them. Most of them were abandoned and useless mineral deposits, which contained a small number of divine power stones.
        This also meant that there might have been a large number of divine power stones in the ancient civilization. They might have been hidden underground and might have even been a real divine power Stone mine.
       
        However, after countless years, the divine power was not obvious and the energy in the divine power stones was lost. As a result, most of the mineral resources were abandoned and useless.
        Behind him, an evil ghost-like superpower said in a sharp voice,""Samsara temple master, you've been in charge of Silver Moon for many years. Have you never come to the Cang mountains to explore?"
        The reincarnation King frowned.
        Even the king of equality wasn't that arrogant, so these hell demons under his command were all very arrogant and weren't too polite to him.
        As one of the ten Hall Masters, even though he was not as powerful as the rising light, his status was still higher than these fellows. Yet, the 16 Lords of Hell had come and did not seem to take him seriously.
        King Zhuanlun said coldly,"the Cang Mountain is not in the Silver Moon territory. It's just at the border. The Li Dynasty is on the other side. If we enter the Cang Mountain rashly, it's easy to cause some trouble."
        "The Li Dynasty?"
        An evil ghost from hell laughed."It's said that a hundred years ago, it was at war with the star dynasty. It has never appeared again. Perhaps it has been destroyed long ago?"
        That's right, the Silver Moon was a wild place.
        Moreover, they had to cross countless mountains and go deep into them. Wasn't the Li Dynasty, a small country in the mountains, a Savage tribe?
         Could it be considered a country?
        It had been a hundred years since they had heard of this small country. At least they had some knowledge to know that there was such a country behind the Cang mountains.
        The reincarnation King did not say anything. The Li Dynasty ... Actually, he also knew that there had been no trace of it for a hundred years. It might have been destroyed naturally.
        However, these guys were too arrogant.
        "Alright, let's not talk about this. Let's continue tracking!" He said in a deep voice.
        Behind him, some evil ghosts quickly displayed their abilities. It didn't take long for them to lock onto the direction and quickly move forward.
        ……
        People came in wave after wave.
        Just as they left, a figure landed.
        Southern Fist!
        He Yong also saw the Python that had been thrown to the side. He looked around and finally looked up at the sky. He said softly,""It's not normal ... Cang Mountain is not a good place. It's ... Very dangerous!"
        As a Silver Moon Martial Master, he had been to the Cang mountains before.
        In the early years, even before the rise of superpowers, he had been here. At that time, he had already vaguely sensed that something was wrong. Yuan Shuo was actually aware of it as well.
        Yuan Shuo said that he had gone deep into the mountains for several years to comprehend the art of five birds, but in fact, he had come to the Cang mountains.
        The five birds that Yuan Shuo had observed back then were a Testament to how Yuan Shuo had been able to comprehend the powerful five birds technique.
        Many years ago, the wild beasts in the grey Mountains were already stronger than the average wild beast. Now that the superpowers had risen for 20 years, perhaps the grey Mountains would really give birth to some terrifying existences.
        Why is Li Hao here?
        The guys from the three major organizations were not afraid of death. They were all supers and actually dared to enter the Cang mountains.
        The martial masters were still fine, but the supers were obviously targeted.
        He didn't know if there were any beasts in the mountains that Yuan Shuo had observed in the past. If there were, it would be fun. Those beasts were extremely powerful back then, and now ... They were probably even more powerful!
         "The five birds are Tiger, bear, deer, ape, bird ..."  He raised his head to look at the sky. The Martial master's eyesight was very good. He seemed to have seen a huge Goshawk. Could it be that the bird that Yuan Shuo was observing was this Goshawk?
        It can't be such a coincidence, right?
        Laughing, He Yong still moved forward quickly and followed them.
        This time, he didn't have many goals in coming to yinbei, and even to the Cang mountains. He just took one step at a time. Perhaps Li Hao could give him some surprises.
        In addition, Li Hao also knew the technique of five birds.
        In fact, this Cang Mountain was an opportunity for Li Hao to strengthen his five birds technique. He just had to see if this opportunity would turn into a desperate situation.
        "If the ferocious birds that Yuan Shuo comprehended in the past have become powerful demons, it's said that Yuan Shuo had defeated many powerful ferocious birds in the past. If these powerful demons are the same as those in the past and have become demons ... Hahaha, Li Hao will be in for a good time!"
        At this moment, He Yong suddenly looked forward to such a scene.
        For example, the fierce tiger that Yuan Shuo had beaten up in the past had become a spirit. If Li Hao were to display the five animal technique, would he be killed by the Tiger?
        It was not a lie that Yuan Shuo had enemies all over the world.
        Other than humans, there were also animals.
        Just as he was thinking, He Yong's eyes moved slightly and he suddenly looked back. Then, he quickly leaped and disappeared from his spot.
        He had just left for a while when another person arrived.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The speed was extremely fast.
        In the blink of an eye, it landed where he Yong had just stopped.
        "Huh?" the person looked forward and raised his eyebrows."Southern Fist?"
        What was he Yong doing here?
        This guy is really arrogant. His vitality has reached its peak. Does he really think that everyone is a fool and can't see it?
        However ... If he could go against sunguang, why was he so arrogant?
         Hong Yitang cursed in his heart. Arrogant guy, be careful that beiquan is still alive and will kill you with one punch, you bastard!
        After looking forward for a while, Hong Yitang sighed with some resentment.
        What are you doing here?
        The grey Mountains!
        Ten years ago, there were already many three yang demons here. Li Hao, you B * stard, you're going to run wherever it's dangerous, right?
        My poor daughter ... Daddy is here to save you, please slow down!
        Thinking of those three yang demons, Hong Yitang had a headache. That was ten years ago. In ten years, they might have become the great demon sunguang or even more powerful. He didn't dare to come to this damn place rashly.
        Was there really no one else from the Li Dynasty?
        He had been killed by the great demons of the nine Heavens eighteen mountains!
        A few years ago, he had met a few of them, but ... They were all on the run. The Cang mountains was really not a good place to hide!
       
        They advanced silently.
        The further he walked, the more shocked Li Hao became.
        'Damn it, did I enter a Wolf's Den?
        Why did he feel that this Cang Mountain was even more dangerous than the outside? at this moment, he saw another ball of light, and there were some more flashing nearby. This was not the first time, and there were more and more.
        The deeper they went, the more.
        Demon!
        There were demons everywhere in the Cang mountains.
        Earlier, he had even seen a three yang demon fly across the sky. Li Hao had avoided it, which was why he had not caused any trouble. He was not afraid of the three yang, but this was only the outer area.
        There was actually a three yang demon here. If he went deeper ... Wouldn't it be more dangerous?
        Liu Long also sensed a dangerous aura.
         At this moment, he quickly stepped forward and said in a low voice,""Let's go a little further to the edge. If we go east along the edge, we can avoid going too deep. According to some of the older people in the Silver City, the grey Mountain has nine mountains and eighteen layers. It has nine enormous mountain ranges, and they have formed the current Grey Mountain. "
        It would be troublesome if they went any deeper into the second mountain.
        Li Hao nodded. After determining the direction, he moved a little to the side. The reason why he didn't walk along the foot of the Cang Mountain was that it was too obvious and couldn't hide his tracks.
        But at this moment, sensing the danger in the Cang mountains, Li Hao did not want to die.
        After walking for a while, Li Hao exhaled and changed his direction.
        Liu Long looked at him, and Li Hao said telepathically,""There's a three yang demon in front of us. Let's go the other way. "
        Liu Long was also speechless.
        This damn place, are the three suns everywhere?
        Why did it feel so terrifying?
        After moving forward for a while, Li Hao touched his head, which was covered in sweat. He changed direction again, and Liu Long looked at him again.
        "There's a three suns in front!"
        “……”
        Liu Long was dumbstruck. He was from the Silver City, and the Cang mountains were right beside him. When had the Cang mountains become so dangerous?
        If the great demons of the Cang mountains liked to go down the mountain for a walk ... The Silver City would have been destroyed a long time ago.
        Li Hao didn't say anything.
        They continued forward.
        This time, there were no demons along the way. Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, there was finally a normal path to take.
        He didn't understand demons, and he didn't understand the habits of big demons.
        The records of Yao had long disappeared.
        The ancient books that Yuan Shuo had taught him also had little records of demons.
        Therefore, it wasn't just Li Hao. In fact, in the current world, both superpowers and martial masters didn't know much about demons. Therefore, very few people knew that demons didn't live in groups.
        When there was an open space in a place full of powerful demons without any demons, if it was during the ancient civilization, those people would tell you not to go!  This meant that there was an even more powerful demon inside. It was so powerful that the smaller demons didn't dare to get close.
        Of course, this was the experience of the ancients.
        The supers and martial masters of the modern era knew nothing about the big demons except for the powerhouses in the central region. They only knew that these demons were very powerful and would sometimes appear with some treasures.
        ……
        Along the way, there were no monsters.
        Li Hao's group also sped up.
        Seeing that the sky was about to brighten, Li Hao didn't plan to continue advancing. Thus, he had the team stop and sent a message: "I'm going to find a safe place to hide and rest. We'll set off at night."
        It was already September 20th.
        Li Hao was also calculating the time. Before the 28th, he didn't know if they could cross the mountain and reach the east side of the transverse Canyon.
        There were still eight days left.
        Based on their speed, it would be a little difficult, but as long as they increased their speed, it wouldn't be a problem. Once they shook off the pursuers or killed them, they would be able to increase their speed.
        After telling everyone to wait here, Li Hao went ahead alone, preparing to find a safe place for these people to rest.
        He moved and jumped, and without anyone following him, he was actually very fast.
        Like an ape, they shuttled through the vast mountains.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They didn't see any demons along the way, which made Li Hao a little uneasy. Why was there not a single one?
        Previously, he had often seen it and felt a little uneasy, but now that he really couldn't see a demon, he was also a little uneasy.
        Moving forward, Li Hao saw what seemed to be a small mountain in front of him. No, it looked more like a Valley. The surroundings were raised, but the center was sunken. Li Hao's eyes flickered. This place was not bad.
        There seemed to be a faint mist rising from it?
        Could it be a Mountain Lake?
        For this trip, they did not bring much dry food.
        It also brought a little water, even less.
         They didn't see any Lake for the whole day, so Li Hao's group was still short of water.
        "Water source ... Where there's a water source, animals will gather together."
        Li Hao was clear about this.
        Therefore, he didn't dare to be careless. This place was a little far from the other side, and there were some rocks between them. He couldn't see clearly if there were any orbs of light inside. Li Hao sneaked carefully, and his aura was barely exposed.
        In addition, he had absorbed the dark energy, which made his aura even more reserved. He was also wearing a bronze mirror that he had taken from Qiao Feilong, so no aura leaked out.
        Li Hao spread out his arms, as if he was soaring in the sky.
        He quickly approached.
        A moment later, Li Hao landed on this mountain rock. There was a jungle nearby, but there was not even a tree here. It was difficult to hide.
        Fortunately, the sky was not completely bright at the moment. The East was suffused with red, and the sun had not completely risen.
        Li Hao walked up. This small mountain was a little special. It seemed to have been dug through by someone. There was no peak. Halfway up the mountain, there was no upper limit, and the surroundings caved in.
       
        With a light tap, he quickly climbed up and reached the top in a short while.
        The surroundings were extremely flat.
        It was as if the top of the mountain had been cut off and a hole had been dug in the middle.
        Li Hao didn't care. He could only sigh at the work of nature.
        This place could be a tourist attraction in any other area.
        He walked towards the end of the platform. He was rather curious about what was down there. Was it a Big Lake?
        There didn't seem to be any way in. Could there be demons?
        He still hadn't seen any orbs.
        When he reached the end of the platform, Li Hao lowered his head and looked down.
        The next moment, he retracted his gaze.
         Her eyes were glistening with tears.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's hair stood on end. Without looking, he turned around. His movements were so light that he couldn't even feel them. Just like that, little by little, he almost moved to where he had come from.
        Then, he glided down the mountain, not even daring to make a sound.
        Her eyes were still red and teary. She looked like a child who had been beaten to tears.
        He glided all the way to the foot of the mountain.
        Li Hao didn't even turn his head and quickly disappeared from his spot.
        He promised that he would not come to take a look at this place even if he was called father next time.
        The moment he stuck his head out, he was blinded. It was like the day he entered the administrative Bureau and saw director Zhao, general Huang Yu, Kong Jie, and hou Xiaochen. These people had blinded his eyes.
        Today, he saw the same scene again.
        In an instant, he saw a snake, an ape, a golden bird, a fierce tiger ...
        Four creatures, four lights.
        He was blind!
        Oh my God!
        What the hell is this place?
        They were probably as eye-catching as hou Xiaochen and the others. At this moment, Li Hao felt that he had traveled back in time, back to the administration Bureau, and that he seemed to see those four old sly bastards.
        Coincidentally, there were four of them here.
        At this moment, he was even wondering if the four of them had transformed into greater demons and were hiding here. Otherwise, why were the lights so similar?
        It was also four!
        What was this place?
        Li Hao was drenched in cold sweat. He glided without looking back. He only wanted to leave this godforsaken place as soon as possible. They were too close to where they had stopped, less than three kilometers away.
        Otherwise, he wouldn't have been looking for a habitat nearby.
        He had to leave quickly!
        While Li Hao was frightened, he was also curious about what the four demons were doing in this shabby place.
        Do you want to drink water together?
        There was indeed a Lake in the valley, and there seemed to be a flower ...
        Flowers?
        Li Hao was stunned. Were these four demons waiting for the flower?
        Snatching flowers to eat?
         Forget it, I don't care anymore.  Although he wasn't afraid of death, he didn't want to die either. One hou Xiaochen was enough to kill Li Hao. Four hou Xiaochen ... Forget it, he was afraid of dying a terrible death!
        ……
        The moment Li Hao escaped ...
        In the valley.
        The four demons looked up almost at the same time.
        However ... It was just a look.
        The giant ape looked at the Golden Condor, the Golden Condor looked at the snake, and the snake looked at the Tiger ...
        Someone was there!
        The four great demons had the same look in their eyes.
        Someone's here, hurry and take a look.
        You look at me, I look at you, we're all looking at each other ... Go!
        In the end, the four great demons did not move at all.
        I won't go.
        Whoever went would be a fool.
        I'm not afraid of people coming, but I'm afraid that once I leave, the Golden Lotus will appear and disappear.
        That would be the greatest loss.
        If the other party really came down, then of course they had to kill him. However, the other party didn't come down, so it was obvious that his strength wasn't that great. Although there was no aura, there was still movement. This wasn't a very strong existence.
        Since that was the case ... Why would they be afraid of him robbing them?
        Therefore, while Li Hao was rejoicing that he had not been discovered, he did not know that it was precisely because he had seen four great demons that he would have lost his life if he had seen even one.
        None of the four demons were willing to leave.
        They were all waiting for the Golden Lotus to ripen.
        p In the lake, the petals of the green Lotus gradually turned golden. There were eight petals, and the Golden Lotus seed inside was slightly green. However, the Golden color was spreading and it was about to mature.  The four demons were still waiting lazily without any movement.
        They knew that someone had come to the Cang mountains.
        A few lesser demons were currently harassing them and disrupting their speed. It wasn't that they were afraid, but that they didn't want those people to arrive too quickly and disrupt the maturation of the Skygold Lotus.
        He didn't expect that someone would come first.
        A Martial Master?
         Probably.
        The few great demons were all thinking silently. At this moment, some great demons recalled a scene from a long time ago.
        The Crouching Tiger recalled the scene many years ago when it was pressed to the ground and beaten up by a fellow ... Those days were the most humiliating moments in its life. In order to comprehend the so-called great momentum of the five birds, a bastard forced it to roar, go crazy, and even go into heat ...
        If you don't listen, hit!
        At that time, it was still a young tiger ... Well, according to the time of a wild beast, it was already a fierce tiger. However, according to the current view, that was naturally the time when it was young.
        Martial Dao ... I haven't seen these martial masters in a long time.
        It was said that outside the mountain, the world was turned upside down.
        Those martial masters who had been rampant in the past were either dead or silent now. As for superpowers, he had seen some ... Well, they were too fragile and could be killed with a single claw.
        Sometimes, she would also think of that person, wondering if he had died long ago.
        He was so arrogant. That day, he had mastered the five birds force and made bold claims. When he went out, he would sweep the world and unify the martial arts world. He entered the Qian dynasty and opened the path of martial arts above the Qian dynasty ...
       
        Was he dead now?
        As the Tiger was thinking, the Golden Eagle was also lost in its memories.
        He should have been a Martial Master just now.
        The Martial Master of the star dynasty.
        It was not a superpower. Back then, he was thrown down from the top of a mountain by an evil person. He was made to hunt and fly. If he didn't fly, he would beat him. If he flew, he would beat him. If he flew too high, he wanted to run, but he was still beaten up. He was beaten up by both sides. That evil person was too strong back then. He could throw a stone hundreds of meters into the sky ... He couldn't even run away. Now that he thought about it, it was probably just that.
        On the other side, the giant ape didn't think too much about it. It only thought of a person in the past who was silly and liked to learn from it. He even ate and lived with it. He did whatever it did.
        He would eat whatever he ate.
        I haven't seen that person for a long time. He's probably dead.
        Out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at the Tiger and the Golden Eagle not far away ... These two seemed to have been beaten up by him back then. Probably, but he didn't remember if it was them. The memory of that time was still very vague and not as clear as it was now.
        It was hard to say if it was these two. He had tried to ask them a few times, but they had denied it. Maybe they were of the same race?
         Who knows?
        Of the four demon birds, only the giant snake didn't think so much.
        As for the person who had just escaped, it didn't care.
        At this moment, the giant snake was only staring at the Golden Lotus.
        He calculated how much he would get this time.
        If they missed this time, they would have to wait another five years. This place was a common treasure land for the four of them. They wouldn't fight over it this time, would they? they would split it equally or use other methods. Until now, they still hadn't come up with a solution.
        In the blink of an eye, the four great demons had forgotten about that person.
        Whether he ran or peeked, as long as he didn't interfere with their division of loot, he didn't care.
        ……
        At this moment, Li Hao had already returned to his original spot.
        His back was already drenched in cold sweat.
        Seeing him return, Liu Long and the others were about to say something when Li Hao said,""Don't speak!"
        The crowd instantly fell silent.
        "Let's ... Take a detour ..."
        Li Hao swallowed his saliva. At this moment, he finally relaxed a little. Fortunately, he had not been discovered. It was too terrifying.
        He knew that everyone was confused, so he continued,""There's a Greater Demon inside! Powerful demons, so powerful that ... They might even be at Minister hou's level!"
        As soon as he said that, everyone stopped in their tracks.
        Their bodies stiffened.
        What level was Minister hou at?
        The existence that killed sunguang with a single spear.
        All of them?  This meant that there was more than one.
        Liu Long's scalp also went numb. Was the Cang mountains that terrifying?
        He was glad that Li Hao had discovered it early and that nothing had happened to him. Otherwise, he would have been finished.
        As for Li Hao, after swallowing his saliva, his eyes flickered, and he tore a small piece of his clothes from his body. It was extremely small, and ordinary people couldn't see it with their naked eyes.
        He glanced in the direction of the mountain. Were the three major organizations still tracking him?
        If they were still here ... They must have some tricks up their sleeves.
        If they had chased him all the way here ... They would definitely continue to move forward. Seeing that special broken mountain, anyone would probably be curious.
        Li Hao didn't make too many arrangements. If he did, it would be too fake.
        Anyone who was slightly smarter would be able to detect that something was wrong.
        It was as if someone had accidentally grazed the fibers of their clothes. Normal people wouldn't notice it, and even if they did, they wouldn't care. This was the best temptation.
        "I hope you idiots don't chase me all the way here ... Otherwise, if you enter by mistake, even Xuguang will be finished!" Zhang xuan said.
        Let alone one Xuguang, four of them had gone in ... If they were all at hou Xiaochen's level, it would only take a short while for them to finish each one!
        Thinking of this, Li Hao looked at the crowd and said,""All of you, step lightly. It's best if you carry one person on your back. Leave less traces. Let's move further away ..."
        "If it really doesn't work ..." He continued,"we'll go back the way we came. If someone is chasing us into the Cang mountains, we'll avoid them and go back!"
        “……”
        Everyone was stunned. Didn't they agree to kill their way out from the East?
        He went straight to the transverse mountains, why did he have to retreat?
        "Don't look anymore. Along the way, there are seven or eight three yang great demons, and there are four powerful great demons that are sunguang or even above ... I'm afraid that we will all die before we reach the East! If someone is chasing us, even if we can't get here, we will come into contact with those three yang demons sooner or later ... Let's observe first!"
        At this moment, Li Hao was a bit scared.
        Would it work if he went through the Cang mountains and kept going east?
         This place sent a chill down his spine.
        Fortunately, he had this pair of eyes. Otherwise, he would be dead for sure.
        That flower seemed to be a treasure.
        If a normal Martial Master or a superhuman saw it, they might try to Rob it.
        Li Hao didn't go because he saw the light.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, existences like hou Xiaochen all had their auras hidden, so ordinary people wouldn't be able to see anything unusual. Perhaps they would treat these four great demons like ordinary demons, and that would be nice to look at!
        Without thinking about this, Li Hao quickly led everyone away from this place.
        It was also a kind of training to March in such a dangerous environment.
        When Li Hao took the risk and led a group of people through the territory of a three yang demon, everyone felt a chill run down their backs. They had actually seen the three yang demon before and were not that afraid of it.
        What he was really afraid of was that once the big demon found out and a fight broke out, would it attract the attention of the few big demons who were comparable to Minister hou in the distance?
       
        This was the part where his scalp was numb.
        Everyone, including Li Hao, was worried that such a thing would happen. Thus, they did not dare to attack these demons. They carefully avoided the three yang demon and Li Hao found a suitable place to rest.
        Between the three yang great demons, there was an area that was adjacent to each other. There were no demons there, and it might be the boundary between the two sides.
        It was under such circumstances that Li Hao led the group to a tree nest.
        A bunch of big trees grew randomly and formed a huge tree nest. It was covered by vines, but under the vines, it formed a closed space.
        It was only when everyone had settled down that a panting sound could be heard.
        Everyone lowered their voices, including Liu Long,"It won't attract the attention of that big demon, right?"
        Just now, they were less than 1000 meters away from that big demon. Those with good eyesight had actually seen that big demon of the three suns. It looked like a lion, but it didn't move. They didn't know if it was sleeping or doing something.
        However, his aura was very strong.
        They were so close to him, but they were still scared out of their wits.
         "It's fine. We're martial masters, and the black flames also have some aura-concealing effects. "
        Li Hao shook his head."I've observed it. It's fine."
        He was not observing the form of the other party, but the fluctuations of the other party's superpower. Once there were fluctuations, it meant that the other party had noticed them. If there were no fluctuations, it meant that they really did not notice them.
        This was something that the others did not have.
        The greater demons might pretend that they did not notice and did not move. However, they would not pretend to have superpowers. Who would notice their superpowers?
        Li Hao could.
        At this moment, Li Hao increasingly felt that this pair of eyes was really useful. Sometimes, they were even more useful than sword energy.
        He was also a little puzzled. Where were the people who had discovered the red shadow?
        There were so many of them in Silver City.
        Out of a million people, there should be at least 10. Even if some died, one out of a million people could produce one. Silver Moon could produce 100 people.
        Where did all these people go?
        It seemed that no one on the night patrol's side mentioned those people.
        If those people were like him, as long as they had a few night patrols, wouldn't it be easy to find a superpower stronghold?
        However, he didn't want to delve into it. He just wanted to find out more about it when he had the opportunity.
        "Boss, you all stay here. I'm going out for a while. If there's nothing else, don't go out. Even if you're peeing or pooping ... Deal with it on the spot!"
        Liu Long looked at him solemnly. Where are you going?
        Li Hao didn't say that he wasn't planning to take advantage of the situation, nor was he planning to keep an eye on the demons ... He just wanted to see if anyone was after him. If there was ... He didn't mind doing something small.
        Lure them over there!
        As for the third party benefiting from the tussle between the Sandpiper and the clam, Li Hao had never thought that it was impossible with the four great demons present. There was only one possibility. Those people were killed, and then he ... Maybe ... Maybe he could wait and collect their bodies.
         I wonder if monsters eat humans?  It seemed to be food.
        Eat the storage ring?
        I don't know.
        Would it be excreted?
        Li Hao's thoughts drifted. His thinking was simple. If these people were killed, perhaps the big demon wouldn't eat them.
        Maybe he would shit?
        A big demon wouldn't use a storage ring, would it?
        In that case, he might be able to get some benefits after the big demon left.
        It would be more convenient for him to be alone, as the dark energy could hide his aura.
        Moreover, he had the bronze mirror with him.
        At this thought, Li Hao suddenly stopped moving. Instead, he took out an Energy Ring and prepared to absorb some more dark energy. Previously, he had thought that dark energy was useless, and he was not a treacherous villain who would launch sneak attacks on others.
        Martial masters were all head-on!
        Why did he need to absorb the dark energy?
        But at this moment, Li Hao thought that he should absorb more. He didn't do it for a sneak attack, but to weaken his aura so that he wouldn't get into a conflict with the demons. After all, humans and demons could live in peace.
        The little bit of dark energy was quickly absorbed by him.
        Li Hao broke another two divine power stones, leaving him with only eight divine power stones.
        He had absorbed about 500 cubic meters of dark energy. He was not short of dark energy. When he killed Yue tan, the peak of the three suns had provided him with at least 2000 cubic meters of dark energy. He had only absorbed half of it, which was only 1000 cubic meters.
        By the time he finished absorbing the 500 cubic meters of mysterious energy, the sky had turned dark again.
         As for Li Hao, his figure moved and blended into the darkness like a shadow.
        The dark element didn't make him stronger, but it made his presence even lower.
        ……
        "Three suns!"
        "There's a three yang demon in front of us!"Banshan said in a low voice.
        As he spoke, a compass-like object appeared in his hand. It glowed with some light and was similar to a super-detector. It was usually not very accurate, but if the other party did not hide his aura, it would be more accurate to detect.
        Tsunami's eyes flickered."Three yang great demon ... To be able to cultivate to three yang, it's not simple. Perhaps the small demons that disturbed us along the way were instructed by this three yang great demon. Kill it and we might be able to get some treasures."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Banshan, however, was a little vigilant and said in a low voice,""Tsunami, it's best not to act rashly. The deeper I go into this place, the more dangerous I feel. Perhaps ... There's a great demon at the sunguang level! If we do, it'll easily cause some trouble. "
        Tsunami frowned.
        This Banshan was afraid of this and that. How did Xuguang cultivate?
       
        "Banshan, since you're already here, are you just going to ignore it? Not chasing anymore? Don't scare yourself. Even if there really is a rising light, you and I are both rising lights. Is there a need to be so afraid?"
        "We didn't even see the bodies of Li Hao and the others. They managed to avoid trouble, so why should we be afraid?"
        The other party had over a hundred martial masters, and they were all walking in front. How did you end up like this at the suguang realm?
        "The three yang great demons usually have at least some divine energy stones in reserve ... Even if they don't have any, their flesh and blood are treasures. Also, I heard that ..."
        Tsunami said softly,"the blood of these demons can sometimes unseal some special origin divine weapons!" You also know that there are souls in origin God weapons, weapon souls! It's very similar to these great demons ... I heard that demon blood of the same origin can activate an origin divine weapon!"
        "Many origin God weapons are now completely dead and can't be activated. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so few origin God weapons. However, the blood of great demons can be activated ... So some guys in the central region deal with these great demons and do business in activating origin God weapons. They make a lot of money every time!"
        Demons were treasures.
        The origin god weapon seemed to be related to Yao.
        Banshan was silent for a moment and nodded."Let's go and take a look. If there's any danger, it's better to avoid it. Also, try not to create any killing."
        "Don't worry!"
         Tsunami laughed and flew into the air. A moment later, she was almost a hundred meters in the air. Beside a swamp in the forest, she saw a snake. The huge snake was rolling in the mud.
        This was the three yang great demon that they had sensed in advance.
        In the air, tsunami's eyes revealed a hint of greed.
        Three yang demonic beast, good stuff!
        In addition, as the snake rolled around in the swamp, some divine power stones rolled out, shining.
        On the ground, the rolling snake seemed to have sensed something. Its huge head looked up into the sky.
        The next moment, the snake seemed to have seen or sensed something. It suddenly rolled and slithered quickly, disappearing into the forest in the blink of an eye.
        A strong Esper!
        ? "I've been discovered!"
        Tsunami suddenly laughed,"he escaped ... Banshan, do you think ... We should chase him?"
        Banshan had yet to speak when tsunami suddenly said,""I saw it swallow some soil when it was running away. There were at least 20 divine power stones shining in the soil ..."
        20 divine power stones was a considerable amount of wealth, even for them.
        Before Banshan could say anything, the tsunami had already flown away."Let's settle it while we're at it. Maybe Li Hao is there too. The unexpected fortune has come to our door. It'll be a waste not to take it!"
        Banshan wanted to say something, but he hesitated. In the end, he still followed.
        He hoped that nothing would happen.
        There were no other spots of light on the compass. It seemed that there was only one snake demon nearby.
        ……
        The giant snake in front of him was fleeing frantically.
        The speed was extremely fast.
         It sensed danger. At this moment, it looked down at its escape route, which was the route to the broken mountain.  It was obvious that the snake demon knew that it was safe there.
        It was also at this moment that Li Hao also saw the three balls of light. His eyes flickered, and he quickly retreated. One of the balls of light was at the three-sun level. It seemed to be a great demon that he had seen earlier, so he avoided it.
        The other two balls of light ... Were very big. They were sunguang!
        People from the three major organizations?
        He vaguely felt that one of them looked familiar, and the ball of light was dark in color.
        The people of the flying heavens!
        He had seen a flying Dawnlight before, and when he came out of heaven battling city, he had seen half a mountain. This ... Half a mountain?
        "So fast?"
        Li Hao, who was hiding in the dark, was secretly shocked. He had been walking very fast with his men, but the other party had actually caught up with him. He had underestimated the means of these people.
        "However, are these two going to kill the three yang demon?"
        Li Hao dodged them and waited for the three yang demons to escape. Not long after, the other two balls of light also disappeared in a flash. They disappeared in the direction of the broken mountain.
        "Eh? You don't need me to lure you anymore? Is he sending himself to his death?"
        Li Hao felt a little strange. Just as he was about to move and follow them, he suddenly stopped. A moment later, a breeze swept over, and balls of light appeared one after another. He could hear faint sounds.
        "Samsara temple master, those two seem to be tracking a great demon. Do they have any treasures?"
        "Why don't we follow them? we don't have to be afraid of them anyway. When the 16 Lords of Hell join forces, even two sunguang's might not be able to defeat us!"
        "Let's follow them. If there's a demon, there must be treasure. The flying mountain has good tracking methods. It's in the same direction as where we're following Li Hao. If we follow them, we'll find Li Hao sooner or later!"
        The group of people quickly disappeared before his eyes.
        Li Hao took a deep breath!
         艹!
        The Yama actually had so many three suns?
        17th place!
        Yes, a total of 17 orbs of light gave Li Hao a fright. He had thought that the Yama might send people, but even the arrival of one Xuguang wasn't as shocking as the arrival of 17 three suns.
        Where did the Yama get so many three suns experts?
        Moreover, they were led by the Samsara King, who was at the peak of the three suns realm and had an origin divine weapon. If these people really cooperated well, perhaps ... The two Xu Guangs might not be their match.
        "Are they crazy?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao found it unbelievable. In order to kill him, he could understand the Crimson Moon coming to Sunglow, but as for the flying heavens ... He could barely understand.
        The Yama, that was incomprehensible.
        The 17 three suns, were they trying to kill him, or were they trying to kill Banshan and the others?
       
        Li Hao frowned.
        Moreover, these people had actually followed him here at a very fast speed. According to this speed, perhaps after tonight, they would catch up with him tomorrow.
        "But are they all crazy? One by one, they ran over there? Don't you want to live?"
        Li Hao muttered in his heart, are you guys crazy?
        Even if so many powerful people came, there were still four greater demons on hou Xiaochen's level. Even if you sent one or two more xuguangs, you'd probably just be throwing your lives away!
        He didn't even want to see it, for fear of being implicated.
        However, just as she was about to leave, her ears quivered.
        A figure flashed by. Li Hao vaguely felt some vitality, but he didn't see the light. He was stunned. Who followed him?
        A Martial Master?
        From a distance, he couldn't feel it clearly, but it was vaguely familiar ... Hmm, Southern Fist?
         Was it this guy?
        Why was he following them?
        Li Hao didn't move at all. He had completely locked down his Shi. For martial masters, the most they could sense was their opponent's Shi. Now that he had locked down his five organs, it would be difficult for them to sense his existence.
        "It's so lively!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao could feel that the southern Fist had disappeared, and he couldn't help but sigh.
        It was too lively!
        All of a sudden, so many experts had barged in.
        The southern Fist ... Wouldn't follow them, right?
        If he really followed them, he would be in big trouble.
        However, Li Hao wasn't kind enough to show up and remind him that the southern Fist came from the royal family, and their attitude was unclear. Li Hao wouldn't believe it if someone said that their sudden entry into the Cang mountains had nothing to do with him.
        Perhaps, it was also to kill him.
        Who knows?
        As for saving him ... He wasn't that kind. In any case, Li Hao didn't believe that the other party would take the risk to save him. They hadn't reached that point yet.
        Is there anyone else?
        Li Hao thought to himself. This time, he didn't move and waited in silence.
        One minute, two minutes ...
        Ten minutes later, Li Hao was about to leave again. Suddenly, he sensed something, but it disappeared in the next second.
         Li Hao was a little suspicious. Did he sense it wrong, or did someone really pass by just now?  At least there was some qi and blood reaction when the southern Fist appeared.
        However, the feeling that he got later on was not very obvious.
        It really did seem like a gentle breeze.
        Li Hao frowned slightly. If there was really someone, he would probably be a Martial Master, and a very powerful one at that. He could even sense a thing or two about the southern Fist, but he could only sense a little about the person who came later.
        "Silvermoon, I don't think there's such a powerful Martial Master, right?"
        As he was thinking, he suddenly thought of someone.
        His heart skipped a beat. No way?
        That person ... Had gone into seclusion.
        Also, was that person really powerful?
        Also, the other party had orbs before, so it was a superpower. It shouldn't be him.
        Li Hao had seen early three yang orbs many times, unlike martial masters who had no orbs at all.
        Li Hao overturned his guess. It probably wasn't him. It was possible that another powerful Martial Master had come.
        Golden spear?
        It might be!
        Li Hao's heart warmed. The Golden spear had actually come to save him?
        What a good person. In Silver Moon, he could not think of any Martial Master that was stronger than the southern Fist. If that person had a ball of light, he would have guessed that it was Hong Yitang.
         The Golden spear ...
        Li Hao was suddenly anxious. Although he wasn't very familiar with that person, he couldn't watch him die if he really came to save him.
        The next moment, Li Hao quickly followed.
        ……
        In front.
        Hong Yitang suddenly turned around with a puzzled expression. Was there ... Someone nearby just now?
        No way!
        It shouldn't be. There was still someone who could hide from his senses?
        He definitely couldn't use superpowers, but as for martial masters ... Which Martial Master could hide from him?
        He didn't think about it anymore. He quickly left and followed the people in front. These guys were messing around. He hoped that they wouldn't attract some powerful existences. He didn't want to harm his precious daughter.
       
        At the same time.
        In the valley of the broken mountain.
        The four demons were still lying lazily on the ground.
        At this moment, the giant snake suddenly raised its head and looked up.
        At this moment, the Golden Condor and the other great demons looked up with surprise and doubt. They were not afraid, only confused ... As if they were confused. Were these humans crazy?
        One had just left, so he was too lazy to pay attention to him.
        Now, again?
        What was going on?
        Moreover, it seemed that the descendant of the little snake had been killed. The little snake was so miserable.
        The few great demons all looked at the giant snake.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The giant snake straightened its head and its body. Gradually, its head was even level with the valley and appeared on the peak of the broken mountain.
        The hundred-meter deep mountain was not even as long as the snake.
        The big head appeared on the platform halfway up the mountain.
        Its huge eyes were like two large millstones as it looked into the distance. In the distance, a dirty Python was slithering madly in their direction at an extremely fast speed, but ... It still couldn't shake off the enemy.
        How strong were the two sunguangs?
        How could a three yang great demon escape from it?
        At this moment, a water arrow shot out. With a loud boom, it blasted a bloody hole in the Python's tough skin.
        In the valley of the broken mountain, the giant snake just watched.
        He looked on silently.
        The three great demons were also looking at the giant snake.
        After a few seconds, the giant snake twisted its body. Without any movement or burden, the giant snake climbed up the valley wall and disappeared into the deep valley in the blink of an eye.
        The three greater demons were rather surprised.
        The little snake ran away?
        The Golden Lotus was about to bloom.
        The giant ape patted the ground as if it was laughing at the escape of the little snake. With one escape, there would be one less person to share the spoils.
        The Golden Eagle moved its claws slightly, indicating that it didn't care.
        It's fine if he left. The little snake is still very strong. It's not a problem to deal with these people. The problem is ... The Golden Eagle actually likes to eat snakes. If the little snake doesn't leave and its descendants are killed, I'll pick up the corpses and eat them. The little snake has no objections, right?
        What a pity!
        The fierce tiger was lying on the ground, too lazy to care about other people's business. It didn't matter if the little snakes left or not. It was best if they all left!
        ……
        BOOM!
        With a loud bang, the Python on the ground was flipped over and blood gushed out.
        Tsunami frowned slightly and reached out his hand. The blood condensed and flew into the sky. Demon blood was a treasure and could not be wasted.
        She wanted to kill this three yang great snake completely.
        However, this snake had thick skin and flesh. If he didn't use some powerful means, he would have to be careful not to let the other party escape. After all, the mountain forest was the other party's territory.
        The rumbling sounds continued.
         The water arrows shot out one after another, and the snake hissed continuously. At this moment, its eyes were filled with anger and madness, but there was no fear.  Why should I be afraid?
        These two bastards. If it wasn't for the fact that the Golden Lotus was about to bloom and his father wasn't around, how could these two people hurt him?
        At this moment, it was very close to the valley.
        It knew that its father must have sensed it.
        At this moment, the only thing that worried it was whether its father would come. The Golden Lotus was about to bloom, and once he left and the Golden Lotus bloomed ... Those powerful existences would definitely take away all the Golden lotuses, leaving nothing behind.
        The Golden Lotus was a precious treasure.
        The Python hissed. It didn't know ... If they would come ...
        However, it still wanted to live.
        Boom! Boom! Boom!
        More and more blood was flowing out.
        At this moment, tsunami smiled. The three suns demon had a really strong defense. He had attacked it so many times before he was able to seriously injure the snake. With so much flesh and blood and the divine power Stone, even if he could not catch up with Li Hao, he would not have come in vain.
        He did not have the time to search the quagmire where the snake was. When he took down the snake and went back, he might find more divine power stones.
        Just as he was feeling happy, suddenly, Banshan said in a deep voice,""Something's not right ..."
        "What?"
        At this moment, the tsunami had already condensed water arrows and was ready to kill this great demon. When he heard what Banshan said, he was a little puzzled. What's wrong now?
        Banshan felt as if his heart had stopped beating.
        He could not breathe.
        The feeling of a storm coming made him feel a little suffocated.
        Gently exhaling, he was about to say something, but in the next moment, Banshan flickered and instantly disappeared from his spot. In the end, just as he left, there was a loud bang, and the darkness was broken!
        The light seemed to have returned to the world.
        A pair of huge eyes ... Eyes that could not even be seen, flashed with a green light, illuminating the surroundings.
        A ghostly fire-like light!
        An enormous snake tail, like a pillar that reached the heavens, whipped through the void. With a loud boom and a bang, a figure was sent flying.
        Pfft!
        He spat out a mouthful of blood and was covered in it. His cloak was torn to pieces, revealing a pale face.
         Half a mountain!
        Banshan's face was filled with shock. A moment later, a small shield appeared in front of him. However, on the shield was a ghost that seemed to be in a state of confusion.
        An origin divine weapon!
        Tsunami was also stunned for a moment. The next moment, his eyes were filled with shock.
        This is ... A snake?
        At this moment, she seemed to have finally seen the other party's appearance clearly. It was an incomparably huge snake. Even if it were to spiral now, it was still tens of meters tall.
        His eyes were very, very big!
        The snake's tail had already been retracted. Just now, this snake's tail had sent Banshan, who had wanted to escape, flying.
        At this moment, Banshan was constantly spitting out blood. The shield was floating in front of him. He looked at the tsunami and cursed in his heart!
        This old woman only knew how to cause trouble.
