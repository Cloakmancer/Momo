If he were to successfully fuse with it, there should be a transformation.However, the other party didn't give him a chance. He was too shameless!For the first time, Li Hao felt that ... There was such a shameless lightning tribulation. The venerable sovereign tribulation waited until someone was about to break through to the venerable sovereign level and was stuck at the last moment before it came to strike you to death, giving you a chance.In fact, the venerable sovereign's tribulation was a real trial, not a sure-kill.And this thing ... Was really a must-kill, not for training. An ordinary peak Heavenly King would have been turned into ashes by the three Thunderbolts without any chance.At this moment, Li Hao gritted his teeth and shouted in a low voice,"the three of you, please help me. Use my spiritual world to block the lightning ... I ... Need some time to recover!"The three experts 'expressions changed slightly.This Thunderbolt ... Didn't look weak.At this moment, this world was Li Hao's spiritual world and considered a part of him. He could stop it, but it was very likely that the lightning would destroy the foundation that Li Hao had built with great difficulty.He gave up the Dao universe and everything ... Only his spiritual world was left.Once it was destroyed, the river of time would collapse.The three experts didn't have time to think about anything. Seeing the lightning strike down, the three experts roared, and their spiritual worlds turned into a huge seal that instantly attacked the lightning!The moment he approached the lightning, Li Hao bled from all his orifices!The three saints all screamed.It was extremely mournful!The entire spiritual world was in a frenzy. If the three saints had not forged the foundation of the world, they would have been destroyed in an instant. At this moment, the stars in the spiritual world burst with brilliant power.Boom! Boom! Boom!A loud sound reverberated through the heavens and the earth. The stars began to dim and some even cracked.Li Hao had spent a long time trying to merge them, but at this moment, all his efforts seemed to have been in vain. His entire spiritual world instantly fell silent, as if it were dead.The huge lightning was still striking, and the world was showing signs of collapsing!At this moment, Li Hao waved his hand and slashed out!The firmament sword tore through the air!A sword that could slash the heavens and earth!BOOM!The fourth Thunderbolt was extinguished, but ... The longsword was slightly cracked. In his spiritual world, the three powerhouses seemed to have completely fallen silent. The entire world was like a dead zone!Li Hao looked up at the sky, bleeding from his seven apertures.The spiritual world fell and disappeared into his mind. The stars that hadn't fused with each other also stopped. At this moment, Li Hao looked at the sky. The fifth Thunderbolt was about to strike.He was not given much time to recover.The river of time was still so weak, and his spiritual world was almost destroyed. The Thunderbolt was meant to cut off Li Hao's hope, but it had only managed to block four Thunderbolts! At that moment, Lin Hongyu let out a shrill and angry roar. Her blade broke through the void and suddenly went straight through the dark clouds of Thunder!She wanted to split the dark clouds!At this moment, li daoheng actually didn't stop him. Instead, he looked thoughtfully at Li Hao, who coughed up blood and roared,""Get lost ..."BOOM!The blade shattered the sky, but ... Lin Hongyu's blade pierced through the dark clouds as if they were in a different space.She ... Could not touch the dark clouds.At this moment, heaven and earth fell silent.In the distance, Red Moon sovereign was stunned.""This lightning ... It's ... It's actually not in the same space as us ..."This meant that no one could die for Li Hao!Except for himself!The spiritual world belonged to him, so he could block it once. But now, Lin Hongyu had risked her life and slashed the dark cloud, but she could not touch it. This meant that they could not block it for Li Hao even if they wanted to.This was because Thunder was not in the same dimension as them.Further away, celestial pole also sighed.""It's useless! The moment this Thunderbolt...I knew I was in big trouble! Besides Li Hao himself, no one can touch it. The lightning won't hurt anyone, it will only kill Li Hao!""I thought ... That it was just a fake chaos lightning tribulation, but it turns out to be real!"He sighed and lamented,'someone has touched the chaos lightning tribulation of the new martial world once! However, I don't have a deep understanding of it. I only know that it's extremely dangerous and much more difficult to deal with than the Tribulation of a venerable sovereign!"He had no other choice.He really had no choice.He had not experienced the chaos lightning tribulation, but someone had experienced it and survived."How did that person survive? tell me!" The Dali King roared.BOOM!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  This time, he was once again pierced through by the long whip. Zhang an slashed out with his saber, causing the long whip to deviate slightly. Zheng Yu did not care and also turned his head to look at the celestial pole. To be honest, everyone was very curious at this moment.This lightning tribulation ... Could it really be passed by a human?They didn't know who had passed the primal Chaos lightning tribulation in neo martial.At this moment, killing Li Hao ... Seemed like they didn't need to do anything. Li Hao might die in the next lightning tribulation. Once he died, the power of time would dissipate. King Dali and Lin Hongyu ... Probably wouldn't be able to keep their current power and would be killed instantly.At this moment, Zheng Yu was also curious.How was he supposed to transcend the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?Heaven's Fate's spirit fluctuated. Although he didn't want to participate in this, his spirit was still overflowing at this moment. He quickly said,""It's the human king who's going through the Tribulation!"Everyone was stunned. Human King?"The human King once encountered a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... I don't know the exact reason. I only know that he encountered it once. As for how he survived it ... It seems ... Probably ... He was taken into his inner world and then given to Emperor Cang to devour!"

Chapter 2451 Changes Are Better Than Plans (3)
"In other words, the human Emperor and Emperor Cang joined forces to deal with the primal Chaos lightning! Logically speaking, outsiders shouldn't interfere. However, Emperor Cang was special. He controlled the heaven and earth together with the human ruler. They could be considered as yin and yang. Hence, they could join forces and Emperor Cang would swallow everything! Even if he's trapped by the human King during the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, he'll still become Emperor Cang's food!"The surroundings were silent.There was an instant silence.This method ... Was he joking?The human King had trapped the lightning and Emperor Cang had devoured it. This was a problem that could only be solved by the two strongest of the neo martial world, the invincible Overlord, and the master of the world. It seemed to be useless to talk about it now.Heaven's Fate was also puzzled."You must have done something. Why did the fusion of the illusory and corporeal great DAOs attract the attention of the chaos lightning? Li Hao, if possible, give up on everything. Perhaps you can disperse the lightning!"This might be Li Hao's only way out.As for the solution he knew ... How was Li Hao going to solve it?Was he as powerful as a human King?Did he have Emperor Cang's assistance?The Thunderbolts that the two world Lords encountered were definitely much stronger than the ones that Li Hao encountered. Even so, the human King did not seem to be able to finish them off by himself. Of course, it was possible that the human King had deliberately brought them to Emperor Cang as food.However ... It was clearly not something that Li Hao could touch.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  ……"Give up?"Li Hao looked at the sky helplessly. Why should he give up?His spiritual world was about to die out, but the lightning didn't dissipate. Clearly, even if he really gave up, he was already here. Why would he leave just like that?What a joke!If I don't kill you, why should I leave?At this moment, a chaotic River swirled around him and Hong Yitang's voice sounded in his mind,""I'll try to block the fifth! I'm a Grand Dao, not a human, and the Dao is invisible. I should be able to block it once. Quickly recover your time energy. As long as you can revive, you'll have a chance of surviving nine times!"Of course, these were words of comfort.Even if there were at least nine, there were still five Thunderbolts left. He had blocked one, and Li Hao couldn't hold back the remaining four.A dead end!The few half-emperors weren't li Hao's biggest threat. Instead, it was this inexplicable Thunderbolt that forced him into a dead end.Li Hao looked at the sky and sighed.""As the saying goes, heaven never seals off a path. Could it be that I've killed heaven's will, so I'm receiving retribution?"He laughed at himself.At this moment, Li Hao stood up. Not far away, Lin Hongyu's aura of death exploded. She looked at Li Hao in despair and powerlessness."Since there's no other way out ... Release Red Moon Emperor's true body and let this Silver Moon ... Let these bastards die with us!"She roared with some unwillingness, anger, and sorrow.How did this happen?Before this, Li Hao had told her some things, and she was certain that after Li Hao succeeded, the two half-emperors wouldn't be able to do anything to them. But ... This lightning was simply baffling! Since that was the case, it was better to break the seal of the eight cities and make the world completely chaotic!Let these venerable sovereigns and half-sovereigns kill each other!Someone would die!They would be buried with Li Hao and everyone else. It would not be a loss whether red Moon Emperor killed them or they killed him.At that moment, Lin Hongyu's breathing was extremely chaotic. She looked at the man with the sword and then at the seven main cities in the distance. Her eyes were filled with death, as if she was ready to break the seal on the eight cities!At this moment, both Zheng Yu and Li daoheng ... Were on guard.He felt somewhat helpless!At this moment, they were really worried that this woman would break the seal of the eight cities without caring about anything. In the distance, the red moon sovereign's avatar was eager to try, as if he was looking forward to it.A chance!Li Hao was almost dead, and Lin Hongyu and the others had nowhere to go. At this moment, in their despair, they broke the seal. Of course, he could take advantage of this and break the seal himself!It was a good thing!Today, was it his lucky day?Even though he had destroyed a clone, so what?Li Hao suddenly laughed,'only targeting me? In a different void ... In a different dimension from the others? The human King can capture ..."At this moment, he seemed to have thought of something.He looked around, at Lin Hongyu, at the Dali Prince, at Zheng Yu and the others, and smiled.""I see!"Everyone was shocked.What was that?Li Hao looked at the fifth Thunderbolt that was about to strike and mumbled,""Lightning can't harm others, it can only harm me ... This is really bullying!"At this moment, he grinned and looked around. He gritted his teeth and said,""I originally wanted to let you guys fight among yourselves. I don't care about anything else. But now ... Let's enjoy it together!"What did that mean? While their minds were in turmoil, Li Hao suddenly roared, and his spiritual world reappeared.At this moment, his spiritual world was extremely broken.Li Hao looked at the spiritual world and mumbled,""Since that's the case ... Let's have a good time together. Let's see if this Thunderbolt is really an invincible existence!"Suddenly, his spiritual world began to expand, extending infinitely!The entire Silvermoon world seemed to be enveloped in an instant. Li Hao sneered and stepped into the void. In the void, a time star flickered indistinctly."I can block it with my spiritual world and capture it with my inner world ... How about I turn the entire Silver Moon into my inner world?"Li Hao laughed. He looked up at the sky and roared,""Then, how about I, Li Hao, become the will of this world? Heaven and earth are me! You're going to kill me!"

Chapter 2452 Changes Are Better Than Plans (3)
BOOM!The time star had actually exploded at this moment!The entire world instantly expanded, and his spiritual ocean was in turmoil!Li Hao's hand covered the sky. He broke through the void and grabbed a person.The Queen only looked at him in silence. The person he was holding was the Queen. Li Hao looked at the Queen and calmly said,""Lend me the power of the Silver Moon and the remnants of heaven's will. Today, I will transform into heaven's will and control the world. If I succeed, I will return it to you!"The Queen was not as angry and frightened as before. She only frowned slightly and nodded, sending wisps of Silver Moon Power toward Li Hao's shattered world!At this moment, a small sword appeared in the sky.Without waiting for the lightning to strike, Li Hao suddenly sneered. He grabbed the weak little sword and mumbled,""In the end, we still can't escape this tribulation ... Then ... Let's play together!"In an instant, his body crumbled and turned into huge stars that fell between the heaven and earth!Boom! Boom! Boom!Countless holes appeared in the sky and earth, and the stars exploded. "You ..." Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly.Heaven's will!Li Hao wanted to refine the entire Silver Moon, or rather, merge himself with the Silver Moon's world and become its will. At that time, he would be the Silver Moon, and the Silver Moon would be him!This wasn't li Hao's plan!Similarly, it was not anyone's plan.It was an act of desperation!Li Hao had to make these people suffer with him. Once he turned into heaven's will, these people would exist in the world and become a part of him. At that time, it was possible that Thunderbolt could help Li Hao attack everyone!However, this was not the result Li Hao wanted.He was supposed to open up his inner world and his physical body, but now, he had no choice but to transform into the Silvermoon heaven's will. It would be difficult to cut off his connection with the Silvermoon. Cutting off his connection with the Silvermoon was not the key, and he did not care too much about it, but if he did so ... Many things would become very complicated!However, in order to survive, in order to risk his life, he could only do this!Time and star, he had not thought about what to merge.Now, he had thought it through.Fuse with him!I am time, I am heaven's will, I am the core of my own great Dao, I am the key to connecting the void and reality great Dao.“艹!”Li Hao cursed and looked up at the sky."I've said that I don't want what the sword Saint and the others don't want.""But today...I have to do it.Whether or not he would succeed was one thing, but at this moment, he felt really uncomfortable. The path he had planned out was broken once again.The key is ... Silver Moon heaven's will. I've said before that Black Panther should be the one to take over. Good fellow, in the blink of an eye, I've taken over the role of the dog! "I've transformed into the world!"BOOM!Blood splattered all over the world, bodies exploded, and stars crashed!At this moment, Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and venerable Red Moon Emperor ... The three powerful cultivators all charged at the falling stars in an instant!He couldn't let Li Hao succeed!If it was really as Li Hao said, and he turned into the Silver Moon's will ... Didn't that mean that everyone would have to face the Tribulation of the chaotic lightning?At the same time, Lin Hongyu's eyes suddenly lit up. She no longer had the intention to die as she shouted,""Kill!"BOOM!Endless power erupted from his body, and it was as if he had instantly recovered to his peak. He charged straight at li daoheng. In the distance, King Dali and Zhang an also instantly unleashed their power. As Zheng Yu frowned, a long whip appeared and directly blew up the book of Dao!He did not care about Zhang an and punched a big star in the sky!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Li Hao was actually going to turn into heaven's will!This was not what anyone had expected. Even Li Hao himself had not thought of this, let alone them.At this moment, a chaotic River appeared and blocked the fist. Zheng Yu's punch shattered the sky and cracked the earth. It was as if billions of stars were falling!At this moment, countless stars appeared.At the same time.On the other side, Red Moon sovereign was about to blow up some stars when suddenly, a person appeared in front of him. Tian Ji looked at the sky and stood in front of Red Moon sovereign. He ignored him and just looked at the sky, raising his eyebrows slightly."This time ... You owe me!"At this moment, he actually made a move.He turned around and punched!He did not use the blood saber but just threw a punch. The punch collided with the opponent's fist and the void was destroyed. Red Moon sovereign's face changed slightly and he shouted in a low voice,"If he really succeeds, the lightning won't just target me. You'll also be in the range!""And then?"Heaven's Fate was calm."It's just a clone of mine here. If it's destroyed, so be it! Besides ... If the will of heaven is truly formed, your true body might be enveloped by it. Are you afraid of some immature Primal Chaos lightning?"He laughed."Perhaps you can break the seal after taking the lightning. Zheng Yu and the others are anxious. Why are you so anxious?"Red Moon sovereign was slightly stunned. What he said ... Made sense.Heaven's Fate no longer paid attention to him. He looked up at the sky and muttered,"The will of heaven transformation ... If it's really tied to Silvermoon, then my achievements will be limited!"His achievements were limited!His words seemed to be saying that the will of the heavens was not worth mentioning, and that Li Hao had suffered a great loss this time. The chaotic Thunderbolt that he had attracted should have had a bright future!However, if he were to turn it into heaven's will, the highest achievement would be the master of this world!But he couldn't think of a better way.

Chapter 2453 Plans Can't Keep Up With Changes
At this moment, it was already very good that Li Hao could still come up with a solution. At such a critical moment, every second counted. Li Hao could even think of turning into the will of heaven, enveloping the Silver Moon, and dragging everyone to deal with the lightning tribulation. He was really a first-class spontaneous person.However, Heaven's Fate couldn't help but feel a little regretful.He still had high hopes for Li Hao!Unfortunately, he was very unlucky to have encountered this thing. Unable to face it, he self-destructed his body and turned it into a great Dao, merging with the world and becoming a vein of heaven and earth ... It seemed lofty, but a small world like the Silvermoon could possibly limit Li Hao's future.Even if he won this time ... It would still be a pity!In addition, he could vaguely tell that Li Hao had withdrawn from the Dao universe. Now, he could not even be considered the master of the Dao, but the master of the world. In this case, his achievements would be even lower!At most, he was an ordinary venerable sovereign.To others, it was still a very difficult thing to do, but to the beloved child of an era ... It was a very regrettable thing. The chaosverse truly had no shortage of venerable sovereigns. Redmoon was a venerable sovereign, and so was he.If Li Hao's highest achievement was only an ordinary venerable sovereign ... What would he be?At this moment, the stars in the world crashed into the Silver Moon, and an overwhelming force rose from all over the world. Li Hao's flesh and blood scattered everywhere!The lightning seemed to have lost its target. It didn't land, but it was still locked on.In the void, a bright moon appeared and instantly turned into a time star.Li Hao's river of time slowly emerged, and a person walked out. It was Li Hao. Li Hao stepped into the Star of time, and suddenly, with a boom, he exploded and fused with the star of time!At this moment, a small sword surrounded Li Hao, and Li Hao instantly became one with the small sword.The whole world was instantly filled with Li Hao's aura. Li Hao's voice slowly sounded,""Cutting off my future ... The enmity of cutting off my Dao, hateful, can be killed, can be exterminated!"Resentful, countless li Haos appeared all over the world, turned into phantoms, and merged into the void. The celestiality emerged and fused into Li Hao's body.In the sky, 180 stars suddenly rose up again.It was like a spiritual world!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  However, everything had changed. Li Hao's spiritual world no longer belonged to him. It belonged to everyone in the world. His spiritual world had merged with the Silver Moon.The stars appeared and were ignited again. The stars that had been extinguished earlier were shining again!One, two, three ...Soon, more than 160 stars were lit up again!It was only at this moment that the void lightning seemed to have completely locked onto Li Hao. The fifth bolt of lightning struck straight at the time star where Li Hao was!However, at this moment, suddenly, Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and red Moon Emperor ... These people suddenly frowned.In the sky, Li Hao turned into a star that covered the entire land, emitting light. Like the God of the Silver Moon, he chuckled. "Let's do it together!"BOOM!Countless Thunderbolts appeared above the heads of the people Li Hao had locked onto. Destructive power overflowed from them. They cursed inwardly,"how can this guy turn into heaven's will so quickly?"Of course, it was also related to the death of the Heaven's Will.At this moment, it wasn't just them. At this moment, in some places, above some people's heads, lightning appeared.In the central continent.A young man's eyes were filled with despair. He looked at the lightning above his head and muttered,""Damn ..."Beside him, a woman's expression changed drastically.""Why did Thunder find you?"The young man laughed bitterly, and his aura instantly grew stronger.""Senior Sister ... I ... I'm also someone favored by the Heaven's Will. I wanted to avenge my master, so ... So I accepted the Heaven's Will. Moreover, I don't have the ability to resist the Heaven's Will ... The Heaven's Will was killed, and some of them are still left. Now that Li Hao has become the Heaven's Will, all the people favored by the Heaven's Will are the targets of the lightning!"On the side, sun Hongxiu, who shared the same name as Hong Yitang's wife, had a look of despair. She looked at her Junior Brother and gritted her teeth."Bastard! Can you beat him? You actually dared to accept the olive branch of the Heaven's Will ... Everyone knows that in Silver Moon, he's even more difficult to deal with than the Heaven's Will!"The disciple of the eyebrows-abrest stick.At this moment, the youngest disciple of the Qi Mei staff said bitterly,""I know, but ... I want to become stronger. Master gave the heavenly Sword to Senior Sister and not me. I think ... I can also ..." He said.When Tianyi was killed, he was glad that he hadn't been discovered by Li Hao, and he was also glad that the ninth Prince had become a Pathfinder.However, at this moment, he was locked on by the lightning!It wasn't just him. At this moment, many people were locked on.……Some talented youths, some ambitious people who wanted to accumulate strength in secret, and some people who had received the favor of heaven's will, were all locked on by the lightning at this moment!Li Hao, who was far away in the Silver City, didn't care about these people at all.He did not intentionally lock onto these people. Instead, he had forcefully transformed into heaven's will and become one with it. These people were all heaven's will, so the primal Chaos lightning would naturally lock onto them.It could only be said that these people had chosen this path.I know that heaven's will is attached to me. If I really wanted to solve this, the Heavenly Star military governor had been looking for these people at that time. They had also made public the news that anyone who was favored by heaven's will could come to the Heavenly Star military governor's office to find a solution.However, they did not go.Since they didn't go ... It meant that they had their own thoughts. At this moment, such an outcome was also their own choice.

Chapter 2454 Plans Can't Keep Up With Changes (3)_6
Li Hao naturally didn't care about them!He couldn't even protect himself, so how could he have the energy to care about these people who weren't of one heart?BOOM!Countless bolts of lightning struck, but the force was much weaker than before.In an instant, be it Zheng Yu, li daoheng, Red Moon Emperor ... Or Li Hao himself, they were all struck by the lightning!The powerful lightning was still extremely powerful even though it was scattered.Zheng Yu instantly vomited blood, and the long whip in his hand turned into ashes.Not far away, li daoheng's long sword was also instantly shattered. The power of Thunder swept out, causing his sword principle avatar to show signs of collapse. On the other side, Red Moon Emperor roared and punched out. The power of destruction appeared on his fist and turned it into ashes!At this moment, even a pseudo-Emperor was having such a hard time, let alone the others.Those who were targeted by the lightning were turned into ashes in an instant!As for Li Hao, he was also struck by the lightning. With a boom, stars flickered.However, compared to before, he was much better.At this moment, Li Hao smiled."The fifth one!"As soon as these words came out, the few people's faces all changed!Bastard!He had thought that Thunderbolt wouldn't be of any help to Li Hao, but now ... He was out of luck!"You two useless pieces of trash!" Red Moon sovereign could not help but roar,"did you just let him become the will of heaven so easily?"Although the Heaven's Will had been killed earlier ... It was too easy for Li Hao to envelop the world and transform into Silvermoon's heaven's will. This was too frustrating!What had these two been doing all these years?It was only the fifth Thunderbolt!Zheng Yu raised his brows slightly and looked up at the sky. The sixth lightning bolt was about to strike down. At this moment, he also smiled bitterly and shook his head."The Heaven's Will is just a tool in everyone's eyes. Who would turn into the Heaven's Will for those who truly seek transcendence ... Moreover, the Heaven's Will has always existed and everyone was prepared to capture it. Venerable sovereign, you can't blame us for this. Moreover, the Heaven's Will was originally under our control ... Now that it has changed, what can we do?"  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Then, he laughed."It's fine. If we join forces, the power of the Thunderbolt will be dispersed. There's a ... High chance that it won't be able to kill us. Just treat it as a congratulatory gift for Li Hao, congratulating him on becoming the will of Silvermoon!"He was quite open-minded and started to entertain himself.At the same time, in the void Dao universe, another li daoheng suddenly appeared. This li daoheng was even more mysterious than the sword-carrying man. He seemed to be formed by billions of stars.At this moment, he was standing at the entrance of the void Dao universe and looking at everyone. He looked at Li Hao in the sky and the chaos River in the distance before suddenly laughing."Interesting. It's a pity that it was destroyed by the primal Chaos lightning tribulation...But it did remind me...That I can't do things that go against the primordial chaos! Li Hao, you really dare to think and do!"In the air, Li Hao didn't say anything. He just looked at the sky in silence.In the next moment, another bolt of lightning descended with a loud rumble. It was extremely fast!BOOM! The powerhouses were struck by the lightning one after another!This time, they took on the power of another Thunderbolt. Li Hao's big star collapsed and then quickly recovered. He absorbed countless energies from all over the world, and the whole world turned into Li Hao's face. "Let's meet again!"Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell.Boom! Boom! Boom!In the sky, several stars were lit up in an instant. On the ground, giant Dragons flew up and charged at the stars in the sky. At this moment, Li Hao was still fusing!Even if it became the will of heaven ... He did not give up on his plan.In an instant, the 170 stars completely fused and lit up. There was even some power of Thunder and destruction mixed in.At this moment, Red Moon sovereign was extremely anxious.""Damn it!"He was furious!The sixth bolt of lightning hit him directly, causing his skin and flesh to split open. Although it was only a clone, it was no different from the real person. This time, he almost screamed out in pain.He had been a venerable sovereign for many years. Although he had been sealed for many years, this was the first time he had been struck by lightning. It was extremely painful, and he had to help someone else bear it. How could he not be angry?However, he didn't even have the time to take revenge. The sixth lightning bolt had just descended when the seventh lightning bolt arrived!This time, it was even more powerful!Li Hao was also speechless. If he hadn't transformed into the will of the heavens ... Even if he could survive the fifth and sixth Thunderbolts, the seventh would have killed him. This time, he was even more powerful!The chaotic Thunderbolt ... Was really not going to stop until it killed Li Hao!I hope there are only nine!Any more and everyone would be struck to death ... Then it would really be over.BOOM!The explosion sounded again. This time, the half-emperors couldn't hold on any longer. At this moment, Li Hao's voice suddenly sounded,""Senior Empyrean pole, you ... You should also participate!"Tian Ji was stunned. In the next moment, the eighth lightning bolt was about to strike. He instantly realized that there was an additional lightning bolt above his head. His expression changed instantly. He gritted his teeth and cursed,"I just helped you!"Li Hao was helpless."I'm afraid ... If you don't share some of the eighth lightning, everyone will be struck to death. The entire Silver Moon will be shattered!" Then we're all done for ... At this moment, we're all on the same side, grasshoppers tied to a rope!""Your wife and Beiwu also have the power of a half-step sovereign ..."Heaven's Fate was furious.Why don't you share it with them?Nonsense!Li Hao didn't bother to explain. They were fake half-emperors, and they would probably be killed by a single lightning bolt.Of course, I'll give some to you, a true pseudo-Emperor!BOOM!The eighth bolt of lightning exploded. At this moment, before anyone else could scream, celestial pole let out a violent scream. That scream ... Shook the entire heaven and earth. It was extremely sharp.

"It hurts!""It hurts!""Li Hao, I'll F * ck your ancestors ..."Heaven's Fate roared and roared. This was too much!Li Hao didn't respond. He didn't want this to happen either ... But since they had been forced to this point, they had to bear it together.I don't want this to happen either!"Senior ... Please pray that there are only nine Thunderbolts. Otherwise ... If we were to fight to the death and end up ... Being struck to death by this thing, it wouldn't be worth it. I'm curious, how did this thing come into being?"Li Hao was also helpless!BOOM!At this moment, a huge Thunderbolt appeared in the whole world, covering the whole world. The dark clouds in the sky surged wildly. The ninth Thunderbolt seemed to be the last strike.The entire world was covered by lightning!At this moment, if one were to stand outside the Stargate, one would be able to see that the entire Silvermoon world was covered in dark clouds.Within the chaosverse, dark clouds began to gather.If not for the fact that the Silver Moon and the Stargate were sealed, the dark clouds that covered the entire Silver Moon would have been enough to kill any expert.How could the primal Chaos lightning be so easily overcome?In this unremarkable dark chaos, at this moment, with the final strike, some dark clouds outside the world of Silvermoon gradually dispersed, as if silently acknowledging the uniqueness of this place. Soon, the dark clouds began to dissipate.The Silvermoon world, at this moment, actually expanded a bit.It had devoured some of the chaos Domain.……Within the Silvermoon world, the giant lightning rumbled, and the sky changed color.Countless li Haos were born and destroyed, destroyed and born again. In the starry sky, the stars were shining.The number of shining stars instantly increased from 170 to 179.The last one was the time star that Li Hao had parasitized.At this moment, this star was wrapped in countless lightning.In the distance, Red Moon sovereign's clone cursed. Half of his body had been destroyed. Zheng Yu and Li daoheng were the same. Their bodies were wrapped in the power of Thunder!As for celestial pole, he was cursing madly,"“艹!”"Li Hao, we're not done yet!"He was also extremely powerful. If he had not participated in the battle, Li Hao and the others might have all suffered. At this moment, they were really tied together.Li Hao wanted to take this opportunity to kill Zheng Yu and the others, but they shared the same amount of power. If they were killed, Li Hao would probably be finished ahead of time, so he could only drag them to the celestial pole!The dark clouds in the sky began to dissipate.The powerhouses were still suffering from the destructive power. In an instant, a wave of death intent and fist intent exploded! The Dali King and Lin Hongyu, who had been waiting, didn't say anything and rushed towards the two half-step sovereigns!I'll take your life while you're down!This was a rare opportunity!If he didn't kill them now, when would he?The power they had borrowed was also rapidly dissipating. If he didn't kill them now, Li Hao would be in trouble once they recovered. Although he had become heaven's will, Li Hao's strength didn't seem to have reached the level of a half-Emperor.At this moment, Zheng Yu suddenly opened his eyes. The destructive power in his body was instantly suppressed by him. With a muffled grunt, he suddenly disappeared and charged toward the end of the sky, where Li Hao's Chrono star was located.He didn't deal with anyone, nor did he care about anyone. He simply charged at Li Hao!His eyes revealed a touch of joy!It was as if he had seen the result he had been waiting for. Although this result was very surprising, the current Silver Moon world seemed to be different. After the baptism of lightning, Li Hao, a talented person, had become the will of the heavens ... In fact, the potential of the entire Silver Moon world had increased.The small world at this moment was absolutely different from the one before!At this moment, seizing the Heaven's Will and devouring the world, he would definitely be able to vindicate his Dao and become an Emperor!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Moreover, his potential would also be much greater than before. The Thunderbolts attracted by Li Hao were no less effective than the Thunderbolts of a dead venerable sovereign who had completely integrated into the world. In this case, he could even leave the red moon Emperor alone for now!Get rid of Li Hao first!He was not the only one. At this instant, in the void Dao universe, billions of stars appeared. Li daoheng appeared and instantly fused into the sword-carrying man's body, and a powerful force swept across the entire world!Li daoheng didn't say anything either. He didn't go straight for Li Hao, but the river of chaos!The two of them had different goals.One had his eyes on Li Hao, while the other had his eyes on the river of chaos.At this moment, the two of them seemed to have reached a tacit understanding. One would capture Li Hao, and the other would capture the river of chaos. They would not interfere with each other. His previous weakness and powerlessness seemed to be a disguise.Red Moon Emperor's clone, who was still extremely weak, could not help but curse when he saw this scene.These two bastards!Behind the two, King Dali and Lin Hongyu roared in anger. They pierced through the void and charged at the two madly. The two of them did not seem to be weakened. One must know that the red moon sovereign's avatar was almost crippled, but they still retained such a powerful strength!Further away, celestial pole's screams continued, but they were full of air.Seeing this scene, he frowned slightly and stopped screaming. He let the destructive power attack him. He looked up at the sky and a blood saber appeared in his hand. He heard the red moon Emperor's cold snort.Celestial pole suddenly turned around and slashed down!"You're too noisy!"BOOM!The broken avatar was directly crushed by the blade. Red Moon Emperor's avatar trembled and collapsed instantly. Tian Ji frowned. After hesitating for a moment, he immediately charged towards the vast planet in the sky!The river of chaos might not be Li Hao's anymore, but he couldn't be bothered.However, the star in the sky was definitely Li Hao. He had to do something about it. This kid from the Zheng family was not simple. Li Hao might not be able to defeat him.

In the sky above the Silver Moon, a great star was suspended.Zheng Yu flew over.The opportunity had come!The plan had been ruined, not just by Li Hao, but by everyone else. But the result was good, at least for Zheng Yu.p Swallowing the will of heaven, taking in the Silver Moon, seizing two DAOs ...If he succeeded today, in addition to the few chaos lightning tribulations he had gone through before, even if the venerable sovereign tribulation really came, he would be mentally prepared and would definitely be able to pass it and become a venerable sovereign!Zheng Yu flew over!At this moment, Li Hao's figure was faintly discernible. The 180th star seemed to be lighting up, but it also seemed to be missing something, as it had yet to become one with the other stars.Li Hao's aura was also fluctuating.One moment strong, the next weak.After the lightning tribulation, Li Hao seemed to have gained something, but he also seemed to have gained nothing.At this time, Zheng Yu's attack was also a huge crisis for Li Hao. The aura of the Dali King, who was chasing from behind, also began to fade rapidly. Once the Dali King lost his half-step sovereign power, even with Zhang an, he wouldn't be able to stop the other party for a moment.In an instant.Zheng Yu didn't say a word when he arrived in the starry sky. At this moment, he didn't even exchange any pleasantries. He reached out and grabbed at the void. The boundless power even surpassed the previous lightning tribulation.It was as if he was going to grab the stars of time, kill Li Hao, and devour Li Hao.At this moment, Li Hao's figure appeared and stood in front of the huge star. He looked at Zheng Yu with a long sword in his hand. The sword pierced through the void, and the world trembled when it was unleashed.From all directions, countless energies swept over and turned into Li Hao's magnificent power.The sword and palm crossed each other!The void was like glass, instantly splitting apart and spreading across the entire heaven and earth. The 180 stars trembled violently. At this moment, Zheng Yu was displaying the true strength of a half-step sovereign, which was incomparably powerful!Behind him, the Dali King used all his strength to punch out, and the sky and earth cracked!Three sides, one front, one back, and one middle.Zheng Yu was attacked from both front and back, but he didn't seem to care. An extremely powerful explosive force suddenly appeared behind him, and with a loud bang, a shocking force burst out, shattering the entire void.The Dali King's fist shattered instantly.At this moment, Zheng Yu seemed to be much more powerful than when he had fought with them earlier.At this point, he didn't seem to be hiding anything anymore.A whip appeared in his hand once more. It pierced through the void and charged straight at Li Hao. With a single strike, the heavens and earth shattered. Although Li Hao's sword light was powerful, the 180 stars hadn't formed a complete circulation system. Even though its power had already reached the level of a half-step sovereign, it was still quickly defeated by this true half-step sovereign.Behind him, celestial pole also arrived through the void at an extremely fast speed. He held the blood saber and slashed through the sky!Although Li Hao said that he didn't owe him anything, Heaven's Fate still chose to participate in the battle. He slashed down with his saber, which contained boundless vitality. A sea of blood surged into the sky, as if it wanted to destroy the entire world!Zheng Yu turned his head and said softly,'senior, why do you have to get involved in this? It's been a hundred thousand years, but senior didn't care about this. Now you're meddling in other people's business!""Just because I can't be bothered doesn't mean I can 't!" Celestial pole sneered.Zheng Yu was still indifferent,"even if senior makes a move, it won't change anything. A half-step sovereign is strong. However, senior is only a clone and not the original body!" Besides ... Senior didn't just suddenly appear. "Celestial pole's expression changed slightly.He didn't suddenly appear!That's right, he had been sleeping in the North for 100000 years. It was obvious that Zheng Yu knew of his existence, so what he meant was ..."Senior has come at the right time. Whether or not we can succeed today, we might still need senior's help!"A three-way siege!In front of him was Li Hao, behind him was King Dali and Zhang an, and to his side was Tian Ji holding the blade of the venerable blood Emperor. This was a genuine venerable sovereign's avatar. An ordinary half-step sovereign would not be able to match such strength.For example, although Red Moon sovereign's clone was severely injured, it did not seem difficult for Tian Ji to kill it.At this moment, Zheng Yu was extremely calm.Suddenly, there were some changes.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 At this moment, Li Hao frowned. Heaven's Fate's expression also changed.At this moment, the eight blood lines on the top of Zheng Yu's head were extremely thick, just like Ying Hongyue 's. However, compared to Ying Hongyue's eight great bloodlines, which were thin and weak, Zheng Yu's eight great bloodlines were extremely powerful!Just as the celestial pole was feeling a little uneasy, the eight meridians merged into one in an instant!Celestial pole's expression changed slightly.Zheng Yu, eight meridians as one!At this moment, his aura rose instantly, and the powerful pressure instantly surpassed even the red moon Emperor's clone and Li daoheng. It was as if Zheng Yu had become the only one in the entire world!The blood saber in celestial pole's hand trembled.The sleeping cat seemed to have sensed something and wanted to wake up and eat this energy.The blood saber trembled violently!Zheng Yu punched out and forced the king of Dali back again. Then, he kicked out and shattered the void, shattering all of Li Hao's sword intent.""Li Hao wasn't within my calculations, but senior ... After living for so many years, how can I not know senior's character? you said that you don't care about anything, but if there really is a chance and someone you think is worth taking advantage of, won't you take advantage of it too?"He laughed contemptuously,'senior, you're famous in the entire neo martial era for pretending to be crazy! The mighty Empyrean pole Prince pretended to be a madman and deceived so many people. When the human king rose, didn't senior still work for the human King?""Although I don't know if a new human King will rise in this era ... I do know that senior isn't as calm as he appears!"

2457 Chapter 410
He understood celestial pole very well.In the new martial era, it was said that everything was ignored, but in fact, the ability to speculate was unparalleled.As the son of Emperor Xi, he had not only managed to survive until the end, but he had also become a venerable sovereign. It was obvious that this was something that the human King had tacitly approved of. He had even supported this.Otherwise, how could he become a venerable sovereign?The fact that the blood Emperor had asked him to guard the saber was a form of trust. Moreover, his father was a true top venerable sovereign. He was not as lazy as he appeared to be.How lazy ... He wouldn't have come to this place and slept quietly for a hundred thousand years, waiting for a cat to wake up.This was also a huge investment!Investing in the blood Emperor, the Cang Emperor, and the king of investors ... There was no other reason. This cat was related to all three of them, especially the Cang Emperor. He was the projection of the Cang Emperor. In the past, he had died in battle with the projection of Zhan Tiandi. Even the heartless Cang Emperor had cried.At this moment, Zheng Yu revealed his sharp edge.The eight great bloodlines above his head rapidly merged into one and completely fused. The Crimson saber in celestial pole's hand began to tremble violently!Celestial pole's expression changed slightly!"Kill him!" The Dali King roared.However, the Dali King was extremely excited. Ying Hongyue's eight meridians had merged into one that day, and all eight of them had been cut off with a single blade. Today, Zheng Yu's eight meridians had also merged into one ... Although he looked countless times stronger than Ying Hongyue.However, the one holding the blade was Heaven's Fate.With one slash, he could still cut off eight meridians!As for Heaven's Fate, his expression changed slightly. He quickly thought about it, and thousands of thoughts emerged in his mind. In the blink of an eye, he wanted to withdraw his saber, but at this moment, the blood saber was somewhat out of his control!Celestial pole's expression changed drastically!Zheng Yu said softly,"my father used his own bloodline to nourish this saber for 100000 years. You're happy to see it. With my father as a spendthrift to nurture this saber for you, it saved you a lot of trouble. Senior, you must have been very happy in the first 100000 years!"Zheng Hongyuan!At this moment, celestial pole realized that he might have been careless and made a mistake!That's right, Zheng Hongyuan had raised the saber for 100000 years and had been trying to seize it and nourish it with his own blood. This was a good thing for the Heaven's Fate as the other party couldn't take it away anyway. It was a good thing for him, and he didn't have to think of ways to continuously provide nourishment for the blood saber.But now ... He had clearly fallen into the other party's trap.Zheng Yu's eight meridians were getting stronger and stronger!He chuckled."Although this is the blood Emperor's saber, he has been away for 100000 years. My father has raised the saber for 100000 years. Even if he is not the owner of the saber, he is the best thing that the blood Emperor can provide for the saber. He should be closer to the Zheng family!"  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 "Furthermore ... The person in the saber has yet to be resurrected. He's only acting based on his instincts. My Zheng family has raised cats for a hundred thousand years ... Senior, do you really think that we've achieved nothing?"BOOM! The blood saber suddenly trembled violently, trying to break free from the celestial pole's control.Not only that, but the huge eight-Meridian Blood Dragon on top of Zheng Yu's head suddenly extended toward the blood saber. In the blood saber, a cat opened its mouth out of habit in its sleep and bit the end of the eight-Meridian Blood Dragon.At this moment, the knife flew directly toward Zheng Yu as if it had eaten something delicious, but the cat refused to let go!Heaven's Fate suddenly realized that he had lost control of the blood saber!His expression changed!Damn it!At the end of the day, a clone was just a clone. If his true self were here, he wouldn't have made such a mistake. However, at that moment, he realized the problem, but it was too late to correct it. Who would have thought that Zheng Hongyuan wasn't trying to snatch the saber, but to ... Nurture it!It was all for this moment, for this saber to be familiar with the Zheng family's bloodline, to be close to the Zheng family's bloodline!He had spent a hundred thousand years just to become a blade's nurturing material ...If this had been planned by the Zheng family from the start, it would be too terrifying. It meant that the other party ... Had long been plotting against the celestial pole and had long considered the other party as an imaginary enemy. They had never thought of letting him go!Behind him, Li Hao quickly retreated.The Dali King's expression changed when he saw the blood-red blade trembling madly and trying to escape from the celestial pole's control. How could this be?Zhang an's expression also changed,"your Zheng family ... How bold!" In order to succeed, we will use all means!"Zheng Yu's father had actually treated him as a blood bank and raised his saber for 100000 years!From the beginning to the end, Zheng Hongyuan had never thought that he would become the master of blood saber. Instead, he had been paving the way for his son!Zheng Yu reached out to grab the bloody saber. The bloody saber was extremely resistant to others. Last time, when Li Hao tried to grab it, he was shaken away by the bloody saber. However, at this moment, he did not resist Zheng Yu. It could be seen that the effect of nurturing the saber was indeed very useful and effective.Not only that, the cat in the knife seemed to like the smell very much. It didn't resist, allowing him to easily grab one end of the bloody knife.Heaven's Fate's decision to join the battle and help Li Hao seemed to have been part of his plan. He was fully prepared!Li Hao's sudden appearance might disrupt his plans sometimes, but Heaven's Fate, who had been in his sights for a long time, couldn't do anything to disrupt his plans.The blood saber trembled and even erupted with a vibrating force. It was not Zheng Yu that was shaken, but the celestial pole!Celestial pole's arm began to tremble violently!He shouted in anger,"you're looking for death!"Even though the blood saber was out of control, he was still a top-notch existence. He held the saber in one hand and fought with his opponent, while his other hand formed a fist and punched toward Zheng Yu!The powerful pressure even suppressed the entire world!

It was extremely powerful!However, at this moment, a powerful pressure also burst out from the bloody saber, which even suppressed the celestial pole and the entire heaven and earth. Zheng Yu said softly,""Eight meridians as one isn't like Ying Hongyue! This cat has yet to be resurrected and everything is based on its instincts. I am feeding it and you interrupted a cat's meal. Don't you know Emperor Cang's character? If I don't give it a good meal, will I give you a chance to eat?"BOOM!The shadow of a cat appeared on the blood saber. Its eyes were closed, and it was biting one end of the eight meridians. It was swallowing the thick power of the eight meridians, but it couldn't finish swallowing it in a short time. When the celestial pole punched, the cat suddenly stretched out its claws, instinctively protecting its food!Kachaa!The fist and claw collided!At this moment, an extremely powerful explosive force exploded between heaven and earth. Tian Ji grunted as blood appeared on his fist, and his expression changed!This cat had followed Zhan Tiandi for countless years.Even if it was just a projection, it was actually unimaginably powerful. With the nourishment of the blood saber for countless years, even if he wasn't awake, just his aura alone was enough to tell that he was far more powerful than an ordinary half-step sovereign!The other party acted on instinct and instantly clawed at Heaven's Fate's fist, almost shattering it.As for Zheng Yu, he took the opportunity to snatch the blood saber.The cat on the blood saber was still biting the eight meridians. At this moment, Zheng Yu had actually used a unique method to control this cat and turn it into his protective talisman. Celestial pole's expression changed again and again!He was somewhat angry, somewhat annoyed, annoyed at himself!Damn it!I was too confident and too careless. The Zheng family actually took the blood saber.At this moment, Zheng Yu chuckled."Senior celestial pole, why don't you leave? otherwise, if you hurt me, you'll be hurting the cat and interrupting its recovery process. Even if you kill me, you'll fail your mission. To the blood Emperor and the others, killing me won't make up for your mistake!""Now, this cat will follow me. When I succeed and all eight meridians are eaten by it, there will be hope for it to be completely resurrected! By then, your mission will be complete. Even if you lose a clone, the cat will still be revived. It will not be considered a failure for you. "Heaven's Fate's expression was very ugly.The cat of the knife was the key to his base. At this moment, his mission had failed, and he had lost both the cat and the knife!Most importantly, if he attacked Zheng Yu, he would be stopped by the cat.If he were to force it to explode, he might ... Might destroy the cat and cut off its hope of recovery. Just as Zheng Yu had said, it would be useless even if he killed Zheng Yu!At this moment, Li Hao also sighed.""The last time I used this cat to trick Ying Hongyue ... I didn't expect to get it back so quickly!"Indeed, it was the cycle of karma.Last time, he had relied on this move to make the celestial pole owe him a favor. He had also killed Ying Hongyue, causing him to die in despair. Now, Heaven's Fate had taken the initiative to help.This was great news for Li Hao. He didn't force others to help him, but if the other party offered to help ... How could he refuse?However ... At this moment, it wasn't just the problem of the celestial pole being restricted. This cat had also become Zheng Yu's protective talisman. It was equivalent to having another half-step sovereign. Zheng Yu had suddenly become two half-step sovereigns.The cat would stay close to him until it devoured the bloodline.Zheng Yu's eight meridians seemed to be a little special. The cat could only swallow them one by one and couldn't swallow them all at once. It was obvious that Zheng Yu had planned all this long ago.p The plan was useless against Li Hao.Against the celestial pole, this move was a stroke of genius. In an instant, the celestial pole was somewhat helpless. Before killing Zheng Yu, they had to kill this cat first!Zheng Yu smiled brightly."I'm not good at anything else. I'm good at dragging people down!" I'm very good at dragging senior celestial pole down! Senior ... I don't need your help, but I'm going to kill Li Hao. Please leave!"Celestial pole's expression changed, and the Dali King said anxiously,""Senior, you can 't!""He killed Li Hao, but he won't let senior off either ..."Zheng Yu laughed."King Dali, you're too naive. Even if I really killed senior celestial pole's clone, it's actually not a loss for him. However, he killed this cat ... If others find out, even his original body will be in danger!" The blood Emperor and Emperor Cang would not allow it. If they knew that they had given up on this stupid cat for a stranger ... Senior, do you know who is more serious?"Who was Li Hao?Do you know those new martial artists?To make the blood Emperor, human King, and Emperor Cang angry for a person they didn't know, was this something a smart person like Heaven's Fate would do?  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 At this moment, the Dali King finally came back to his senses. Yes, this was only Heaven's Fate's avatar. If he really lost his avatar, it would not matter. But if he insisted on attacking now ...That would be even more troublesome!All of this was clearly within Zheng Yu's expectations. He no longer paid attention to Heaven's Fate. He didn't even care that his back was facing the other party. When Heaven's Fate attacked, even a cat would protect its food and stop it.[This is also a kind of Open Conspiracy. You can only watch helplessly ... And can't do anything to me!]Heaven's Fate was furious!Previously, he had thought that Red Moon sovereign was stupid, but now ... He wanted to give himself a few tight slaps. How am I any better than Red Moon?Damn it!For the past 100000 years, he had been watching Zheng Hongyuan use his own qi and blood to feed the blood saber. He had thought that Zheng Hongyuan was trying to snatch the saber, but that was not the case!

2459 Chapter 410
The other party was not trying to kill venerable sovereigns with the saber, but to nurture the saber!He was using himself as bait!Yes, at this moment, Zheng Yu was the same. He was the cat's feed. Was that important? It was not important at all!The crucial point was that celestial pole, this powerful half-Emperor avatar, didn't dare to move.Li Hao's voice sounded,"senior, thank you!" Since it involves senior's mission, then senior should leave and don't mind us. "Zheng Yu smiled."It's not a matter of whether you care or not. If you resist, this cat will also deal with you. If you have the ability to kill a half-step sovereign, kill this cat first. I believe that senior celestial pole will know what to do. Li Hao, you're not facing two half-step sovereigns now, but three!"He, the cat, celestial pole!Originally, Li Hao had a chance to turn the situation around. But now, he had easily blocked all his chances and escape routes with the eight meridians as one.Zheng Yu was also emotional."You're really capable. You've exceeded my imagination. Of course, I can only say that time is too short. However, this is inevitable. The times have made you, so the times will not leave you with too much time!"As soon as he finished speaking, he whipped Li Hao!As soon as the long whip fell, a bloody saber slashed at Li Hao!It was the blood Emperor's saber!In the hands of a pseudo-Emperor, this blade was extremely powerful. Just like last time, it had cut off Ying Hongyue's eight meridians, leaving her with no hope. Zheng Yu seemed to be using the same method to deal with Li Hao.The longsword exploded!Li Hao's sword attack seemed to freeze time. However, it was useless. He was still weaker than this half-step sovereign, not to mention that he wasn't the only one.Although gathering the eight meridians exhausted Zheng Yu greatly, it was also because of this that he was able to avoid the killing in the celestial pole.The king of Dali was anxious!However, at this moment, his aura was declining, and it was difficult for him to even approach. Zhang an was also rapidly thinking about how to deal with this situation of certain death ... However, Heaven's Fate, the only one who had the ability to resist, was being restricted!He could only watch helplessly!All of a sudden, they were so anxious that they almost collapsed. The lightning tribulation just now had failed to kill Li Hao, so this time ... Did Li Hao have a chance to turn the tables?They were anxious and helpless!Heaven's Fate could only be unhappy. He looked angry and displeased. He wanted to beat this bastard to death, but ... To be honest, compared to this cat, Li Hao was still more important.He was very aggrieved, but he could only hold it in!He could only wait for the cat to devour the eight meridians before he could make a move. After devouring the eight meridians, the cat would no longer be protective of its food. Whether it was resurrected or not, he could still make a move and kill this bastard!You actually dare to threaten me!But by then, Li Hao might have already died.At this moment, Li Hao said helplessly,""Senior, since you've made your move, and he has offended you ... Although you can't kill him because of the cat ... Can't you help me block him? Senior should be able to hold them off for a while if they just defend and don't fight back, right? are they just going to watch?" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ “……” The surroundings were silent.The celestial pole clone was stunned.Stop him.It seemed that ... No one had ever thought of it this way. In the eyes of experts, the celestial pole was currently restricted and was no different from a cripple. Even Zheng Yu thought so.But Li Hao said ... To help me block them.It's true that you can't kill, but your physical body is so strong that even half-step sovereigns can't compare to it. Even if you were to fully defend, it would still take some time for the opponent to break through your defense, right?He was depressed. The celestial pole ... Was really just watching.You're already so aggrieved ... So what if you're even more aggrieved and beaten up?That Zheng Yu can kill you in an instant?If he could kill you in an instant, the other party wouldn't even have to scheme.Such a simple thought was never considered by the powerhouses. The difference in status, strength, and knowledge made them naturally abandon the idea of full defense.When celestial pole spoke of the Dali King, he was very clear and logical. You can't beat him, but you can still block him for a while.At this moment, when it came to him, he had forgotten about this.In an instant, Heaven's Fate's expression changed. He instantly appeared between Li Hao and Zheng Yu and gritted his teeth."So, I can still defend!"He still said such childish words.Because he had really forgotten!As for Zheng Yu, he could not help but laugh and was a little dazed. "I'm sorry, I also forgot. Seniors can't fight, but they can still defend!"After saying that, he laughed, and his laughter was extremely hearty,""That's right, at this point, who would consider purely defense? It's such a simple understanding, but it's not even in our consideration ... Seriously ... The more time passes, the more ignorant I become. No wonder people say that you should become famous and powerful as soon as possible. If it's too late, your thinking will be rigid!"In an instant, he made his move!BOOM!Boundless saber intent instantly slashed down. Tian Ji's body overflowed with golden light, and his entire body instantly turned golden. The golden light was brilliant, and the endless power of the Golden body overflowed with a loud bang!Heaven's Fate grunted. He was still not used to only defending and not attacking.Fortunately, his physical body was strong enough!Zheng Yu's saber slashed down, but he still managed to resist it. The next moment, more golden light overflowed, and he said in a deep voice,""Do you have a way?"Li Hao, do you have a way?If this continued ... Defense was not a good choice. He would not be able to take the initiative to attack. Sooner or later, something would happen, and he would be hacked to death by Zheng Yu.Behind them, Li Hao looked at the sky.Lin Hongyu's deathly aura was beginning to dissipate. Li daoheng was chasing after the river of chaos.
