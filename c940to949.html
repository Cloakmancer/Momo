        aughed cruelly."This is good stuff. If I use it, I can deal with late-stage sunrise experts or even peak-stage sunrise experts. It's a waste to let you use it!"
         Although Li Hao was stronger than before, in hai Sha's eyes, the blood Blade technique still couldn't last long.
         Not only that, this was the ocean.
         Since the fellow in front of him had chosen to fight here, there was no way he could escape. Perhaps he could wait for his three suns subordinates to finish off those people and come to help.
         Of course, he didn't think it was necessary to go to this step.
         He could suppress Li Hao.
         The saber flickered and slashed dozens of times in the blink of an eye. The waves were shattered one after another, and the saber Light illuminated the void. Li Hao's shadow in the darkness appeared in an instant. His longsword pierced through the air, and with a bang, it hit the saber.
         However, the long saber was completely unscathed, which was somewhat unbelievable.
         This blade seemed to be an origin divine weapon.
         However, it didn't show its weapon soul, and the body of the saber was of excellent quality. Although the starry sky sword was invincible, it couldn't pierce through the saber.
          "Not bad ... Is this the Li family divine sword? However, my saber isn't bad either. This is a treasure I obtained from an underwater ruin. It's much stronger than an ordinary origin god weapon. Hahaha ..."
         Hai Sha laughed wildly. He attacked again and again, continuously suppressing Li Hao. Li Hao, who had activated the bloody blade technique, had fused four elements, and the waves were helping him. However, he still couldn't match his opponent. They were only evenly matched, but slightly weaker.
         This made Li Hao frown.
         Pirates ... Were all this strong?
         He felt that he was much more powerful than the Masters on the God tier Masters Ranking list.
         At this moment, an angry shout came from the distance. With a loud bang, Liu Long had exploded. With a swing of his axe, he sent one of the three suns flying. With incomparable anger, he suddenly roared,""Kill them all! These bastards!"
         Li Hao glanced into the distance and saw that the cabin was in pieces, revealing many corpses. Some of the corpses seemed to have been cut open.
         Hai Sha also looked over and laughed,""What kind of silver spear son is that? He wasn't weak! Why are you so angry? it's just killing some ants. I heard that you have to eat something to replenish your energy. If you're too powerful, your five internal organs will be weak. I heard that eating some hearts can replenish your power. It's better than your five birds breathing technique ..."
         Slightly dazed, Li Hao looked at him and spoke for the first time.""You guys ... Killed and ate people?"
         "No, no, no. Why would I eat people?"
         BOOM!
         Hai Sha swung his saber again and laughed."We don't eat people, we just eat your organs. I heard that martial masters have stronger organs and it's more satisfying to eat. We also know that when superpowers are cultivated to the extreme, the organs are easily damaged. If we eat your organs, we can avoid these drawbacks ... Hahaha, I'll teach you for free. You're qualified to be your master, right?"
         Li Hao was in disbelief!
         This was the first time he had heard of such a theory. Eating a person's five internal organs and strengthening them ...
         This greatly impacted his spirit!
         He had thought that these people killed people because they were perverted and crazy ...
         However, at this moment, hai Sha told him that they killed people to eat people's five internal organs and strengthen their own five internal organs ...  The psychological impact made Li Hao unable to calm down at this moment. Anger surged in his heart, a soaring anger. These people ... No, these animals, are they still human?
         They ate people!
         "Kill!"
         With a furious roar, Li Hao slashed out with his sword. The sword energy soared into the sky like a fierce tiger that exploded like a volcano.
         With a loud bang, hai Sha was forced to retreat again.
         However, Li Hao didn't retreat. He took all the shock. The next moment, he approached his opponent and slashed crazily and rapidly!
         "Hahaha!"
         Hai Sha wasn't shocked. Instead, he was happy. This was the effect he wanted. If a Martial master's state of mind was in a mess, how could he be a match for him?
         One burst of energy, and then three!
         As a pirate who had killed countless people, he knew how to provoke the sensitive nerves of these people.
         As expected, Li Hao, a new and inexperienced Martial Master, couldn't hold back.
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         Hai Sha began to focus on defense. He allowed Li Hao to attack him like a storm. Hai Sha retreated continuously, but he did not consume too much energy. Li Hao, on the other hand, began to pant, but he continued to attack with the power of his five internal organs!
         In one go!
         One strike after another, one strike after another ...
         Li Hao didn't know how many times he had attacked, but hai Sha's defense was impenetrable. At this moment, hai Sha's body was also covered in blood. He was injured by the sword energy, but he was still strong. The more blood he bled, the more brutal he became!
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just this?
         It might be enough to deal with an ordinary mid-stage rising light realm expert, but ... I'm a mid-stage rising light realm expert!
         Li Hao, a mere newbie Martial Master, wanted to break through his defense?
         Li Hao's eyes were filled with killing intent. Seeing that this person was difficult to kill, he gritted his teeth and looked into the distance ... That ball of light seemed to be a true ball of light, not a Lighthouse. It seemed that an expert was coming.
         Damn it!
         Without much hesitation, he fused the four forces. Because it was difficult to improve his divine intent, there had not been much improvement, unless he comprehended the fifth force. However, it was obviously impossible at this moment.
         Originally, he had wanted to wait for the five Forces to merge, but now ... He didn't have that thought. He wanted to kill this beast as soon as possible!
         In an instant, a lotus petal appeared.
         Li Hao instantly stuffed the Skygold Lotus into his mouth.
         Hong Yitang once told him to eat after he fused the five Forces. Otherwise, if he strengthened one force, it was very easy for the other forces to become weak, causing the five Forces to no longer be balanced. In the worst case, he might not be able to comprehend the other forces.
        
         But Li Hao didn't care.
         As soon as the Skygold Lotus entered his stomach, it transformed into a clear stream. In the blink of an eye, a unique energy fused into his five internal organs, and the four forces appeared in his five internal organs. It was as if they all wanted to absorb this energy.
         Li Hao didn't hesitate. He instantly fused this energy into the Golden origin.
         Metal force, burst!
         The stronger metal force was, the more explosive Li Hao's power would be. The explosive feeling of an instant explosion, combined with the ninth-refinement force, would make Li Hao's explosive power much stronger.
         This energy instantly fused with him.
         The Golden origin greedily absorbed this energy. In the blink of an eye, the origin became bigger and began to struggle. The previously incomparably powerful Super Lock had locked the origin, making it almost unable to move.
         However, at this moment, he was shaken.
         Li Hao felt it. He clearly felt that the golden sword force had become much stronger!
         Furthermore, it was still increasing.
          A single petal of the sky Gold lotus had even attracted the attention of the great demons at the rising light transformation stage. They were all guarding it, which showed how effective it was.
         "Die!"
         In an instant, Li Hao attacked!
         BOOM!
         The longsword struck out, and at the moment of contact, an extremely powerful explosive force, which was even stronger than before, exploded with a bang. Hai Sha was still defending.
         With a bang, this time, he was shaken by the powerful explosive force. His arm suddenly exploded, and some blood and flesh splattered out.
         Hai Sha was a little surprised and shocked.
         How did he suddenly become stronger?
         He had a lot of battle experience. Seeing this situation, he no longer defended and quickly charged at Li Hao, his long saber cutting through the void. Li Hao, on the other hand, did not defend and continued to attack!
         Shadowless Sword!
         One sword after another, over a hundred sword strikes were unleashed. Li Hao ruthlessly slashed out with his sword, suppressing his opponent's long saber with a loud bang.
         At this moment, Li Hao opened his mouth and let out a tiger roar!
         "Roar!"
         The roar shook people's hearts. Hai Sha was slightly stunned, and his eardrums were bleeding. He was a little absent-minded. At this moment, Li Hao spat out a Dark Sword energy.
         Bang! Bang!
         The Dark Sword Qi instantly broke through hai Sha's face defense. Hai Sha's expression changed. He tilted his head, and with a "PU Chi" sound, one of his ears was directly cut into pieces.
         Hai Sha's eyes flickered with madness."You bastard, you're even more annoying than that bastard Jin Jin!"
         He lost his ears!
         Li Hao ignored him. At this moment, he attacked again with his sword. His attacks were continuous, and he firmly suppressed his opponent.
         The power of the metal sword force caused the fusion of the four elements to be slightly off. However, they could still fuse together and become even more powerful!
          Li Hao suddenly stretched out his left hand and grabbed the long saber. The saber trembled violently, and an extremely sharp saber Qi rushed toward Li Hao. The silver armor blocked most of the saber Qi, but his palm under the armor was still injured and bleeding.  Li Hao didn't care. He shortened the sword in his hand and stabbed it at his opponent's chest!
         Hai Sha had been holding his saber with both hands. Seeing this, he roared and clenched his saber with his right hand. His left hand clenched into a fist, and his metal-elemental power burst out. With a dazzling radiance, he smashed toward the small sword in Li Hao's right hand!
         At this moment, Li Hao's hand that was holding the sword suddenly stopped for a moment. With a loud bang, Li Hao's hand that was holding the sword was smashed into pieces by a punch. Even hai Sha was stunned.
         So fragile?
         It didn't matter if his hand was smashed, but the sword that seemed to be the Li family's divine sword had also been smashed?
         Just as he was feeling a little suspicious, his expression suddenly changed. At this moment, a third hand seemed to grow out of Li Hao's chest. It instantly reached down, its right hand forming a claw and grabbing out!
         Hai Sha's expression changed. With a violent roar, a powerful super power burst out from his crotch. The metal element power cut in all directions, but Li Hao didn't care. He grabbed out!
         Crack!
         The metal elemental energy was crushed, and something else seemed to have been crushed by him. The power that exploded was the metal sword force!
         "Ah!"
         Hai Sha, who did not even blink when his ears were broken, let out a pained cry. Not only that, the power in his body was released, and his eyes were filled with pain and hatred!
         Li Hao ... Damn!
         What kind of battle technique was this?
         A third hand ...
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's face was cold. He took advantage of the other party's weakness. In an instant, his arms twisted like little snakes and wrapped around the other party's hands.
         The long saber was surrounded by the two of them, shaking violently.
         It cut through Li Hao's armor.
         However, Li Hao didn't care. He lifted his knee, and with a boom, hai Sha's body arched. Hai Sha was in extreme pain, feeling as if his five internal organs had been shattered by the knee. But he was also a ruthless man. At this moment, he roared and kicked Li Hao!
         There was a loud bang!
          In the blink of an eye, the two of them went from a weapon fight to a close combat. Their superpowers erupted again. Metal energy flickered and exploded, leaving some marks on Li Hao's Silver armor.
         Li Hao's arms wrapped around him. With a roar and a loud crack, he directly broke one of his opponent's arms.
         The two madly attacked each other!
         A fierce tiger appeared, roaring in the forest. Hai Sha was startled again, and blood flowed out of his seven orifices!
         Li Hao took advantage of the situation and quickly pulled him down!
         BOOM!
         The two of them fell directly into the sea.
         In the sea, hai Sha roared and kicked again and again. Li Hao's armor rumbled from the continuous kicks, but Li Hao continued to pull his opponent down.
         The silver armor had the ability to fight in the sea.
         As he fell deeper and deeper, hai Sha could clearly feel that the heavy pressure of the sea water reduced the power of his metal-elemental superpower. Li Hao took the opportunity to knee him again!
        
         The nine layers of waves overlapped. BOOM!
         There was another loud sound. The waves in the sea exploded with an incomparably powerful explosive force. This knee attack directly shattered hai Sha's knee. As their knees collided, the waves stacked on top of each other and exploded. With a loud bang, hai Sha's knee was completely shattered. One of his legs drooped down, and his blood dyed the surroundings red.
         Li Hao continued to pull the shark down, and the shark struggled violently!
         At this moment, he felt that Li Hao's combat strength had not weakened at all. As for him ... Because he had only one ability, being a metal element super, his combat strength was limited when he was pulled into the sea and deep into the sea.
         He was already injured, and now that his combat strength was restricted, the situation was reversed.
         The deeper he dived, the more afraid he was!
         But Li Hao didn't give him any chance. His hands were still tightly wrapped around his opponent. Hai Sha wanted to roar, but he couldn't make a sound. He was angry and anxious, and he hit Li Hao's head!
         Seeing this, Li Hao also charged forward!
         Is your head as hard as mine?
         Besides, I still have my silver armor.
          Bang! Bang!
         Hai Sha's head collided with his opponent's head. He was stunned and almost fainted. In the past, he had used this move to deal with others. When it came to ruthlessness, Pirates were no worse than anyone else. However, this time, he suffered a huge loss.
         His head was bleeding!
         On the other side, Li Hao didn't show any mercy. He charged head-on. Once, twice, three times ...
         Blood dyed the surroundings red!
         Li Hao exerted strength in his arms. While hai Sha was still a little dizzy, he tore off one of his opponent's arms. Then, he quickly locked his other arm with his arms and exerted all his strength. He used the bear fighting technique and concentrated all his strength in his arms.
         BOOM!
         The seawater exploded. Li Hao used all his strength to break his other arm!
         Blood instantly dyed the surroundings red.
         His arms were completely torn off.
         The pain woke hai Sha up. He was extremely weak. He looked at Li Hao with despair and disbelief in his eyes ... He was going to die at the hands of this person?
         At this moment, the armor on Li Hao's hand disappeared.
         He grabbed at him!
         With a pfft, Li Hao's claw directly broke through his weak defense and pulled out something from his chest. Li Hao dug out his beating heart!
         The armor on Li Hao's face was removed, revealing his face.
         He was very young and very cold.
         "So ... Your heart is also red!"
         "Since you like it so much, you should eat more!"
         Li Hao's punch made hai Sha's head bleed and dizzy. Li Hao grabbed his head and squeezed it tightly. With his other hand, he crushed hai Sha's heart and stuffed it into his mouth!
         Hai Sha closed his mouth tightly. Li Hao's inner strength burst out, and with a bang, his mouth exploded. All his teeth were shattered. Li Hao ruthlessly stuffed all the heart fragments into his mouth!  Once again, he grabbed at his abdomen!
         He grabbed anything he could find and stuffed them into hai Sha's mouth. Hai Sha's eyes were filled with despair and unwillingness.
         At this moment, Li Hao seemed particularly cruel.
         A moment later, he dug out his internal organs and stuffed them all into his broken mouth.
         Then, he tore his legs apart, crushed them into meat paste, and continued to stuff them in!
         At this moment, hai Sha seemed to know what he was going to do, and his eyes revealed a trace of fear ...
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was still holding his head tightly. With his other hand, he kept breaking his body parts. His legs were torn apart, and he stuffed them into his mouth. Then, his butt continued to move upwards ...
         Under hai Sha's terrified gaze, Li Hao tore off his other ear and stuffed it into his mouth ...
         Li Hao dug out her nose and even her tongue, crushed them, and continued to stuff them in!
         At this moment, hai Sha's eyes were filled with boundless fear and despair ... Li Hao had told him to eat himself, but he was still alive.
         The fear in his eyes quickly disappeared.
         His eyes were also gouged out by Li Hao!
         He stuffed it into his mouth.
         Li Hao's eyes only recovered a little when he couldn't see his eyes anymore. Without the madness and coldness from before, he punched out. With a bang, the last remaining part of his head was completely shattered!
         Li Hao reached out and grabbed the falling saber and storage ring. He looked up and swam quickly in one direction. He didn't fly out, but instead saw a huge ball of light.
         Very strong!
         He might be at the late-stage of the rising light realm.
         As for the demon hunt squads, he believed that Liu Long and the others could deal with them, and even if they were not up to the task, they wouldn't be defeated so quickly. He was going to kill the second powerhouse.
         He must be one of The Pirates!
          There was no other reason. As the other party's balls of light approached him, the faint smell of blood could be sensed. It would be strange if they weren't Pirates. A group of disgusting guys. Li Hao gritted his teeth. He would kill this guy and exterminate this group of Pirates sooner or later.
         At this moment, Li Hao didn't know where black Panther was, but he believed that Black Panther was definitely near that person, looking for an opportunity.
         The Black Panther could kill a mid-stage Sunglow realm expert with a sneak attack, and it could also kill a late-stage Sunglow realm expert ... Li Hao could only hope that the Black Panther was a little smarter.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com ……
         At the same time.
         The masked man quickly flew over. He had been following hai Sha, but in order not to be discovered by hai Sha, he was a few dozen miles away. It seemed that a battle had just broken out here.
         He was worried that something might have happened, so he rushed over as soon as possible.
         In the distance, he could already hear the sounds of fighting.
         As for hai Sha, he seemed to have fallen into the bottom of the sea with a person and disappeared.
         The masked man frowned. Wei Wu Army?
        
         Black Phoenix?
         His opponent and hai Sha seemed to be evenly matched. At this moment, he couldn't care about anything else. Hai Sha's combat strength was very strong, and he was a valiant general. He couldn't die Here, even though it didn't seem like he would lose.
         At this moment, a Black Dog floated in the sea. It stared at the man for a while and twitched its nose. It seemed to have smelled Li Hao.
         Li Hao was approaching.
         The Black Panther sensed that this person was very powerful ... And he reeked of blood. He was an expert in killing. It didn't know if Li Hao knew how to kill this person. The Black Panther only knew that if it had launched a sneak attack first, Li Hao might not have been able to kill this guy.
         Therefore, Li Hao had to make the first move so that it could launch a sneak attack ...
         But Li Hao, do you understand?
         Black Panther was also very anxious. Li Hao didn't know if he understood, because sometimes Li Hao felt that he was a bit silly.
         Just as Black Panther was thinking about this, a sword light suddenly shot out from the sea!
         "You're looking for death!"
          BOOM!
         His opponent's palm slammed down. With a loud boom, the seawater exploded, revealing a black mist. It was Li Hao, who had suddenly burst out. His sword attack caught his opponent off guard, but he still managed to react and slap Li Hao into the water.
         The Water-type powers exploded and the surface of the sea split open. The masked man looked coldly at Li Du, who had fallen into the sea."Swordsman? The Wei Wu Army? Li Hao? Just nice ..."
         Then, he thought of something."You killed hai Sha?"
         Otherwise, the sea shark would not have disappeared!
         Li Hao didn't reply. Instead, he roared and drew his sword!
         It wasn't silent, but rather, it was extremely loud. With a loud boom, the sea water exploded, and waves swept in from all directions. A dog was rolling in the waves.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Although they hadn't discussed it, Li Hao quickly made some decisions and changes.
         The long sword shone in the sky, and the sound of the sword rang out in all directions!
         "The one who will kill you, Li Hao!"
         Li Hao roared. BOOM!
         The long sword cut through the air. The masked man's face behind the mask was cold.
         Then let's see who will die!  He struck out with his palm again. The water dragons roared and charged at Li Hao.
         Li Hao, you're the only one who can die!
         At this moment, he vaguely felt a sense of danger. Before he could figure out the problem, Li Hao roared again and slashed out, shattering all the water dragons. The longsword burst with dazzling blood Qi as it attacked him!
         The masked man shouted coldly. He exploded again, and the water energy swept across!
         At this moment, a dog appeared behind him and struck out with its paw. Ninefold force burst out, mixed with powerful blood Qi and inner strength ...
         Puchi!
         The claw pierced through his back, instantly breaking his defense. His opponent's main force was focused on Li Hao, so his defense wasn't very strong. The claw pierced through his back, and even his heart!
         The masked man couldn't believe this sudden attack ... Where did so many powerful people come from?
         At this moment, with his superpower dispersing, Li Hao's sword pierced through his palm, his arm, and his throat, connecting his palm and throat!
         Behind him, the Black Panther bit down and bit the other party's neck. With a crack, the neck was directly bitten off!
         The masked man's head drooped ... At this moment, he still didn't understand.
         What's behind it?
          He didn't look like a human!
         Li Hao's long sword slashed, and with a creak, his head fell into the water!
         It was much easier to kill this late-stage cultivator. The main reason was because of Black Panther. The timing of his sneak attack was too good, and he directly pierced through his heart.
         Li Hao looked at the Black Panther. The Black Panther hurriedly sucked in a mouthful of seawater in disgust and began to rinse its mouth. It carefully glanced at Li Hao ... I don't eat people, don't look at me!
         It's just a dog, it has to bite to be powerful!
         Li Hao put away the storage ring and punched his opponent's body. He didn't see the origin god weapon, so he frowned slightly. Without saying anything, he quickly flew toward the big ship in the distance.
         None of these guys could be left alive!
         "Black Panther, patrol the surroundings. If anyone escapees ... Kill them all! After you're done, go to the place where that person came from and keep an eye on him. There might be others ..."
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         The Black Panther cried out and instantly fell into the sea, disappearing. Its nose was extremely sharp, so it was impossible to escape its pursuit.
        
         Li Hao quickly returned.
         At this moment, the battle on the deck had turned into a white heat, and people were constantly being killed. There were also demon hunt squad members who were sent flying, falling into the sea, their life or death unknown.
         However, when they saw Li Hao ...
         In an instant, the Pirates were terrified.
         Where is the leader?
         In the next moment, a sword light flashed and with a loud bang, one of the three suns that were surrounding Liu Long was torn into pieces by this sword. Another sword light flashed and another sword struck. The other three suns screamed in fear but still couldn't escape death!
         "Run!"
         Someone shouted, only to let the others escape and fight for a chance of survival. Only with more people fleeing could they escape from this sword Xiu.
         "Kill them all, don't leave a single one!"
         Li Hao's voice resounded, and the sword Qi swept across the world with a constant buzzing sound!
          The sounds of explosions and cracking continued to ring out.
         Blood and flesh flew everywhere!
         Many Pirates had already died, but these Pirates could still fight when the wind blew. Even though they had lost people, they could still fight. But now, with Li Hao's appearance and their leader's disappearance, they all lost their will to fight.
         Fleeing!
         A large number of superpowers began to flee.
         Li Hao killed a superhuman with one strike! Sometimes, he even killed several superhumans with one strike! In the blink of an eye, hundreds of superhumans were killed on the spot by his sword Qi!
         The demon hunt squad members "morale was greatly boosted!
         They all attacked!
         In the blink of an eye, a large number of supers were killed on the spot.
         "I surrender, I surrender ..."
         Some of the sunshine supers roared and knelt down to beg for mercy. They did not have the dignity of a superpower, but only fear and terror.
         Many people looked at Li Hao ...
         "Kill!"
         Li Hao's sword pierced through the superhuman with one word. The other Pirates gave up completely. Someone shouted,""Let's go all out with them!"
         "Kill!"
         “……”
         Those who shouted loudly were killed by the sword Qi in the blink of an eye.
         Holding his sword, Li Hao kept chasing.
         Even so, some of the superpowers still disappeared into the water. Li Hao didn't care. His sword entered the water, and his blood boiled. The light was still there, so where could he hide?
         Could he hide?
         Even if there was a powerful person who could Dodge Li Hao, he might not be able to Dodge the Black Panther's nose.
         The massacre continued!
         After fighting for five or six minutes, Li Hao's hands were getting tired. The surroundings were completely silent, and only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard.
          Corpses were everywhere!  The water and the surrounding area were all dyed red.
         Out of the 600 supers, only a few managed to escape while the rest were killed. However, could those who managed to escape really survive?
         Li Hao looked into the distance, and a ball of light was instantly extinguished.
         It was silent!
         Even though Black Panther was a dog, he seemed to be good at swimming. Even Water-type superpowers that were underwater were instantly killed by the Black Panther.
         Its nose was extremely sensitive, not inferior to Li Hao's eyes.
         Li Hao landed on the deck. At this moment, the deck was in pieces. This big ship was of good quality. So many superpowers were fighting, but it was still not completely destroyed.
         The cabin behind the deck was also filled with corpses.
         In such an environment, soft sobs could still be heard. Li Hao glanced in that direction and saw that there were more than a dozen women who were still alive among the crowd of corpses. They were all shivering and hiding in a corner, only daring to sob softly.
         ,m Li Hao took off his armor and revealed his face. He looked at them and said in a dignified tone,""I'm Li Hao, the Vice-Minister of the Silver Moon Nightwalker and the captain of the Wei Wu Army. I'm here to patrol the sea and eliminate Pirates! They're from the military!"  They might not know about the night patrollers or the Wei Wu Army.
         However, they should know about the military.
         However ... As soon as these words came out, these people trembled even more.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's expression changed slightly, and his mood suddenly became heavy.
         This ... What was this for?
         At this moment, he seemed to have understood something.
         Some of the women in the crowd trembled as they looked at Li Hao. When they saw Li Hao looking at them, they hurriedly lowered their heads and trembled in fear."Sir, we ... We don't know anything ... We ... We didn't see anything ..."
         At this moment, the military did not give them a sense of security, but ... An even more terrifying feeling!
         Li Hao knew that these people should have come from the destroyed town in Linjiang province.
         However, Li Hao had saved them, but they didn't feel grateful. They didn't have a new life, only ... Fear.
         Why?
         Was it because ... The military had lost their dignity and trust?
          Could it be that Linjiang was in more trouble than Silver Moon?
         The people didn't believe in soldiers. Had the world reached such a level?
         He thought of the heaven battling Army. Presumably, when the heaven battling Army attacked back then, it would not be like this. It definitely would not be like this.
         "I am the captain of a demon hunt squad!"
         Li Hao looked at them."I'll send you back. I already know that the town has been destroyed. Perhaps there are still people alive ..."
         "No... I'm not going back ..."
         Suddenly, someone knelt down, sobbed, and trembled. His voice was filled with fear."No... General, please don't send us back ... We ... We want to survive ... I have a kid ... If we go back, we won't be able to survive ..."
         Li Hao was stunned.
         He looked at the woman in a daze, not knowing what to say for a moment.
         "Linjiang is ... More feudal. Even if there are still survivors in their homes, they'll still die if they're brought back," Liu Long transmitted his voice.
        
         Li Hao was stunned and looked at Liu Long.
         Liu Long transmitted his voice,"besides, the town has been destroyed. If these people are still alive, those at Linjiang might say that they've colluded with Pirates or were spies. They can't be sent back. If they are sent back, they'll have no way out." I ... I saw some very young children under the cabin. Some of them are still alive ... Perhaps some of these women have children among them. Leader ... You can't let them go back!"
         Li Hao was lost in thought and didn't reply.
         Why?
         He actually understood, but he hoped that he didn 't.
         It shouldn't have been like this!
         Linjiang was useless and couldn't resist the Pirates, causing the town to be destroyed and countless deaths and injuries. These women were captured and trampled on by the Pirates. Now that they were alive, shouldn't Linjiang be the one to deal with the Pirates?
         However, once Liu Long explained it ... He understood.
         He had originally thought that Silver Moon was actually quite weak. When Silver City was in danger, the Nightwalker came ... At the time, he had even thought that Silver moon's Super System was really useless!
         However, today ...
          Li Hao suddenly laughed at himself.
         As it turned out, this was an era where people were comparing the worst of the worst. Compared to their neighbors, Silver Moon seemed to be doing pretty well. The higher-ups in Silver Moon seemed to be doing quite well. There were people fighting the Pirates, people managing the superpowers within the country, and people's livelihood was also taken care of. Everything was still operating as usual ...
         When he was reading the ancient book, he felt that Silver Moon was a little lifeless. There was no vitality at all, and the people were just living an ordinary life.
         However, at this moment ... Even though he had not gone to Linjiang, he suddenly felt that Silver Moon should be much better than these places.
         It was ... Laughable!
         He didn't say anything and walked down to the bottom of the cabin full of corpses. There were many corpses, including ordinary people, supers, martial masters, and ... Children.
         Many people had their internal organs dug out.
         Li Hao watched silently. At this moment, he was standing among the corpses, standing among the piles of corpses, without a sound.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com What kind of F * cking era is this?
         Humans ... Were even more ruthless when it came to killing!
         "Waa ..."
         An ear-piercing scream woke Li Hao up.
         He took a few steps forward and saw a metal cage with a few children locked inside. They were all very young, some of them still in their swaddling clothes. However, at this moment, they were like goods, stuffed into the metal cage just like that. It was crowded with people.
         At this moment ... There were also children who had died.
         However, there were still many children still alive in the iron cages.
         Li Hao looked at the children. Some of the older ones were covering their mouths in fear, while others were covering the mouths of the wailing babies, as if they were afraid of something.
          Li Hao moved and broke the iron cage.  Some of the women who had been frightened earlier were trembling. They looked at the black-armored warriors in horror. Some of them couldn't move and suddenly crawled toward Li Hao.
         "
         With a trembling voice and a body that couldn't walk, he climbed over the pile of corpses, ignoring his fear, and quickly climbed towards the iron cage.
         Li Hao squatted down and picked up a wailing child who had fallen to the ground after being squeezed out.
         It was too small.
         Perhaps she was only a few months old and didn't even have any teeth. At this moment, she was sucking on her own little hand. Perhaps she was extremely hungry, and she quickly started crying again."General ... The child is hungry ... I didn't mean to disturb you ..."
         Li Hao turned around. Holding his child, he looked at the women crawling toward him and asked in confusion,""I saved you. I'm a soldier. I'm protecting you. Why ... Are you so afraid of me?"
         Shouldn't you be grateful?
         Even though I don't care, do I look that evil?
         The women didn't dare to say anything. One of them quickly took the child from Li Hao's hands, took off her clothes, and breastfed the hungry child, ignoring Li Hao's presence.
         The milk was mixed with blood, and the ground was covered in blood as they crawled.
         The little child finally stopped crying with the milk, but the milk seemed to be very little. The woman was too frightened and could no longer produce milk.
         In the metal cage, some of the children were also trembling.
         Li Hao wanted to say something, but he didn't know what to say. He looked behind him."Hong Qing, Liu Yan, you female soldiers, take off your black cloaks ... Come over and have a chat with them!"
         With that, he stood up and left.
          A wave of sword energy spread out in all directions. Without it, these people might have frozen to death. In the night, the sea breeze whistled, and it was very, very cold.
         The demon hunt squads began to clean up the battlefield, and several female soldiers quickly walked over to those people.
         These people were surprised to see Liu Yan and the others, and the fear and terror in their eyes seemed to have lessened.
         ……
         Li Hao walked out of the cabin, and everyone quickly cleaned up the battlefield.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He scouted the area and quickly dove into the sea. A moment later, he threw out black banners. In the battle just now, more than ten martial masters had been thrown into the sea, and some had even fainted.
         If Li Hao didn't look for them, they might all die in the sea.
         Yunyao began to heal some of the injured martial masters. They had been well protected in the previous battle and had avoided a lot of trouble.
         A moment later, Liu Long returned and said while panting,""We killed about five hundred supers. The exact number can't be measured. We seized nine storage rings. Some of the sunlit ones were wearing storage rings too. I didn't see the exact number."
         "In the cabin, there's a place that looks like a warehouse. There are some divine power stones stored inside, but they're not in storage rings. Perhaps they're public funds."
        
         "We've collected about 20000 cubic meters of mysterious energy ... A lot of it has spilled over, or there would've been even more. However, many corpses have fallen into the sea, and we can't search them anymore ..."
         The 20,000 cubic meters of mysterious energy came from these superpowers.
         The exact amount would depend on the storage ring.
         Li Hao got two, both from Xuguang.
         As for Liu Long, he had obtained a total of nine, so his harvest might not be small.
         Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it. He was just a little confused."Boss, Silver City may be small, but the inspection Office is still trustworthy in the eyes of many. The garrison is also trustworthy in Silver Moon. They should be excited to see an inspector or a soldier in danger, but ... Why are they like this?"
         Liu Long sighed."Linjiang, or rather, many other places, are filled with soldiers. Some soldiers are even more brutal than bandits. The bandits might even let you live ... Soldiers can just cut off your head and use it as the enemy's head to claim the military credit!"
         Li Hao couldn't believe it. He looked at him and said,"Linjiang, not the three northern provinces. There's still the Governor-General's Office. It's not completely chaotic ..."
         "It's the same!"
         Liu Long shook his head,"besides, those who died were just some civilians. Who would care?" "In the beginning, the ninth Division was doing fine, but it gradually went out of control. It had something to do with the rise of the supers. If the supers had not risen, the situation might have been better in the ninth Division for a few more decades. However, the rise of the supers ... The reform was interrupted, and some people in the ninth Division were helpless ..."
          At the beginning, the nine divisions 'desire to change was not bad.
         Silver Moon was also one of the beneficiaries. He could not say that the nine divisions were not good, but at least they were better than when the royal family was in charge. However, before the nine divisions could completely reform, the rise of superpowers 20 years ago had broken everything in an instant.
         Therefore, the world was in complete chaos!
         Li Hao felt a little helpless.
         For the first time, he felt the darkness. No wonder these people were so afraid of soldiers ... It turned out that sometimes, soldiers were even scarier!
         On Silver moon's side, things were pretty good. Huang Yu was in charge of the garrison, and the garrison had strict military discipline.
         Li Hao exhaled. At this moment, he had no idea what to think.
         It was a little chaotic.
         Of course, he didn't think about it.
         The enemies might not have all been killed. He looked at Liu Long,"You stay here. I'll go take a look. Maybe there are still people who haven't been dealt with!"
         "Be careful!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He stepped into the air and left. He just wanted to get as far away from this place as possible. At this moment, many things subverted some of his views.
         It turned out that other than the Silver Moon, there were even more terrifying things.
         The Silver City was actually not bad. It was just a few scattered supers that came over, but they were taken care of by Liu Long and the others. The three major organizations did not dare to be too flamboyant here, the military had been suppressing some unrest, and the Wei Wu Army had also been killing the Pirates ...
         The seemingly useless Administrative Bureau seemed to be operating without a sound, and the People's lives were still stable. At least, Silver Moon had not heard of anyone starving to death.
         "So Silver Moon is considered a Holy Land?"
         Li Hao mumbled in disbelief.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wasn't it said that Silver Moon, the border province, was perhaps the poorest among the 99 provinces?
          Didn't Silver Moon from the border province have a bunch of barbarians?  Didn't they say that Silver Moon martial forest was the darkest?
         But ... Why did he feel that this place was superior to many other places?
         The three northern provinces were in turmoil. Linjiang was originally said to be much richer than Silver Moon, but at this moment ... Some of his thoughts were suddenly shattered. It turned out that it was just so-so!
         With all kinds of thoughts in his mind, Li Hao quickly flew far away.
         On the surface of the sea, a dog was rolling and biting the last Super to death.
         Li Hao looked at the Black Panther."Can't you learn from a big demon and use spiritual communication?" he asked.
         It was very tiring to be unable to communicate.
         Heibao looked at him, feeling a little lost. He shook his head,"No."
         "Why?"
         Black Panther shook his head and continued to shake it, but it just wouldn't work.
         As for why ... Who knew.
         It could understand and wanted to speak. It wanted to learn from the old turtle and communicate with him by using its spirit. However, it always felt that it was lacking. It seemed ... It seemed to be because it was too weak!
         Yes, weak demons could not speak.
         As for when he could ... It seemed that he still had to become stronger, and continue to become stronger. In any case, he would be much stronger than he was now, so he might be able to do it at that time.
         Li Hao was a little disappointed.
         Without saying anything, he waved his hand and stepped into the air. The Black Panther quickly stepped on the sea. Under his feet, there seemed to be waves rising and falling. It felt like the momentum developed by the ninth refinement.
         This dog seemed to have cultivated the nine tribulations to an extremely profound level. It didn't know anything else except for the five birds technique, but it seemed to have really inherited the nine tribulations.
          A man and a dog quickly moved forward.
         After flying for dozens of miles, Li Hao saw another ship. At this moment, there was also a flag flying, but there were no lights, only darkness. However, Li Hao saw hundreds of light orbs!
         Over a hundred people!
         However, he felt that the quality was very high. There were all the Pirates and Starlight Masters before, but here, the weakest one was Yue Ming. Most of them were sunlit, and there were three three sun powerhouses.
         Compared to the previous batch, although there were fewer people, the quality was much higher.
         The White shark Pirates!
         Seeing the flag fluttering in the wind in the dark, Li Hao knew that it was also the White shark Pirates. He didn't expect that two groups of white shark Pirates, one in the middle of the rising light Stage and one in the late stage, would come.
         He really thought highly of Silver Moon!
         "Kill them all!"
         Li Hao summoned the Black Panther, and the next moment, he landed on the ship without a sound.
        
         Like an assassin in the dark, he quickly locked on to one of the three yang. His sword struck out silently and with a pfft, he slit the throat!
         "Enemy attack!"
         At this moment, a sharp sound was heard.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was like a king of Darkness, wandering around the ship, sword after sword. As a Martial Master and wearing silver armor, these people couldn't find him at all. They would only know where he was after he killed someone.
         "The enemy is too strong, run!"
         Someone shouted and jumped into the water. As soon as he jumped in ... He disappeared. The Black Panther guarding the water tore him apart and fell into the sea one after another.
         Someone flew into the sky. The next moment, a sword light flashed and a corpse fell.
         "We're the White shark Army ... Who's this expert ..."
         Puchi!
         Before he could finish his words, he had already been torn apart. White shark Army?
          A group of man-eating bandits actually dared to call for an Army!
         This made Li Hao feel that it was laughable.
         In the darkness, Li Hao unscrupulously attacked with his sword. Even though he was heavily injured, he only wanted to kill these people as quickly as possible!
         After five or six minutes, Li Hao kicked open the door of a cabin and killed a superhuman hiding in it. He smiled.
         Where should he hide?
         Outside, Heibao also jumped onto the boat.
         A man and a dog kept wandering around the ship, and a series of screams came again. Some people wanted to hide from their pursuit and restrain their powers, but in the eyes of this man and dog, there was almost no such thing as restraining their powers.
         One relied on his eyes, while the other relied on some special smells to distinguish.
         A few minutes later, the ship was completely silent.
         Li Hao had some more storage rings in his hands.
         "Commander Liu, does anyone know how to pilot a ship? Bring that ship over to meet up with me. We've seized another ship!"
         Li Hao sent a message in the channel. Liu Long quickly replied,""I will, I'll be there soon!"
         ……
         About ten minutes later, the dilapidated ship approached Li Hao's ship. Although there were some holes on it, it could still move.
         The two ships were both very large and sturdy.  It must have been reinforced by superpowers or even refined into the ship with some treasures. Even superpowers could not destroy it easily.
         At this moment, Liu Long and the others also saw the corpses on the ship.
         Soon, someone jumped over and began to clean up the battlefield without Li Hao's order.
         After a short while, Liu Yan also jumped over. She looked at Li Hao and said,""They've been appeased for a while, but their emotions are very unstable. There are too many corpses over there, and they're all civilians 'corpses. It's not good to throw them into the sea ... Leader, can you move them here?"
         "Yes."
         Li Hao nodded slightly and didn't say anything.
         Liu Yan quickly went back to make arrangements. At this moment, Hong Qing also walked over with red eyes. After taking off her armor, she looked a little sad."Leader, they are so pitiful, they have no home to return to. Can I ... Can I bring them back to Silver Moon and then send them back to swords gate?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com “……”
         Li Hao was stunned. Hong Qing quickly explained,"there are many similar situations in the swords gate ... Under such circumstances, if we don't comfort them properly, it's very easy for them to be wounded. The swords gate has experience. Otherwise, even if we give them money and food ... They will go crazy over time!" In swords gate, there will be people who have similar experiences to comfort them and guide them. This way, they can walk out of the shadow and be reborn, otherwise ... No matter where they go, they will still end up dead. "
         Li Hao nodded. He really didn't know how to deal with this situation.
         At this moment, he felt much more at ease after hearing what Hong Qing said.
         The swords gate ... Might be able to deal with these problems that he couldn't solve.
         If Li Hao was asked to kill, he could kill, but he really couldn't do anything else.
         Hong Qing continued,"I just had a chat with them. They said that the one we just killed was the third commander of the White shark Pirates. In the afternoon, the White shark Pirates broke into their town and killed everyone in it. They only left these pretty girls behind ... And some children who needed their care. That's why they were not killed." In the past, this situation has happened before. In the end, all the women were killed. After the children were raised, they might eventually become Pirates ..."
          Li Hao frowned. At this moment, he didn't really want to talk, nor did he want to understand this.
         He had a feeling that after this massacre, he was still holding a breath.
         "The White shark Pirates lost more than 600 supers this time. Two sunguang and eight three suns ... How strong do you think they are?" Li Hao asked after a long while.
         Before they could answer, Li Hao took a deep breath and said,"forget it. Let's not talk about this for now. There are too many people here. Let's go back first!" That's right ... All the corpses of the White shark Pirates ... Move them to the broken ship and ... Hang them up!"
         Their expressions changed slightly!
         Li Hao's eyes were cold."Hang them on the ship and sail back. At dawn tomorrow, the news might spread. If the White shark Pirates want revenge, they can come!" If they don't come ... After I've settled these people down and eaten my fill ... I'll come and find them!"
         "Guild leader ..."
         "Why don't we keep a low profile? we might still have a chance to ambush them ..." Liu Long frowned.
         "No!"
         Li Hao shook his head."It's useless to keep a low profile. If you keep a low profile, these animals will become even more brutal!" He could only fight violence with violence! Stop killing with killing! Even if I wanted to kill that dawnbreak Bandit, he wouldn't be afraid at all, but when I used an even crueler method against him, he became afraid. For people like this, we can't just kill them, we have to make them feel fear!"
        
         Li Hao knew that perhaps sinking the ship and pretending that nothing had happened would be better. It would be more beneficial for him to launch a sneak attack on them next time.
         But ... That way, these guys would not feel fear.
         Liu Long was still a little worried,"if the other party were to attack the Silver Moon ..."
         "Hmph!"
         Li Hao's eyes were cold,'if that's the case, if the people in white moon City don't make a move ... Then there's nothing left for Silver Moon to miss! Kong Jie, director Zhao, Deputy Director Zhou, commander Huang Yu, who wasn't a top expert? Also, don't forget ..."
         He wanted to say that the earth overturning sword was also in Silver Moon, but seeing that Hong Qing was there, he did not say it.
         With so many powerhouses here, you're not going to do anything when the Pirates attack. Are you going to wait until you die?
         Li Hao didn't want to know if they had any plans. He only knew that the White shark Pirates might not have the guts to come.
         If they really came, then he would kill them!
         Liu Long thought for a moment and nodded.
          At this moment, he didn't try to persuade her anymore.
         At this moment, Li Hao had suffered an unprecedented shock and had lost his self-control. Li Hao, who kept a low profile and wished that no one knew his strength, was now hanging the corpses of these Pirates on the ship, even intentionally warning the North Sea pirates.
         Liu Long didn't say anything more, but shouted loudly,"Hang all the corpses of the Pirates on the sails!"
         "Yes, sir!"
         The crowd cheered. Some of the martial masters of swords gate felt very satisfied and didn't feel that there was anything wrong with it. The disciple of swords gate who had told Li Hao about the cruelty of the Pirates was even more excited. He felt so satisfied that he pierced through the bodies one by one and hung them on the sail with a rope!
         The women who were being transferred were dragging some children. Liu Yan originally wanted them to retreat and wait for a while, but those women came out one by one and stared at the Pirates hanging on the sails with venomous eyes and a look of satisfaction.
         However, she still couldn't bear to see it and blocked the children's view.
         Li Hao just looked at him without saying anything.
         When everyone was done cleaning up, he ordered,""Return to the city!"
         Under the control of some demon hunt squad members, the two large ships sailed South, and at this moment, the sky was already bright.
         Li Hao punched out and completely shattered the fluttering flag on the ship!
         After thinking for a while, he hung a long black cloth. In the next moment, his divine intent appeared. A fierce tiger, like a man-eating beast, seemed to be about to break out of its cage and was imprinted on the flag!
         Li Hao's sword-finger drew out, and a blood-red "li" character was imprinted on the flag.
         The flag was high in the sky, fluttering in the wind.
         At this moment, Li Hao was silent. He looked at the flag and seemed to be lost in thought.
         Tiger out of the cage!
         It was as if he wanted to say something, but he did not know how to say it. He could only create the first flag in his life, the fierce tiger li flag!
         The darkness completely dissipated.  The flag fluttered in the wind, like a tiger roaring in the forest, ready to devour!
         ……
         He went south.
         Kong Jie had arrived.
         On the shore, Kong Jie frowned. She was a little tired after rushing here overnight. Even with her strength, she was still a little tired after running all the way. She had wanted to go out to sea, but Wang Ming told her that it was unnecessary. Li Hao and the others were on their way back.
         At that moment, Kong Jie was frowning.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao actually went out to sea in the middle of the night!
         If they were to die at sea, then ... There would be nothing to say.
         Fortunately, the problem didn't seem to be too big. He had returned, and perhaps he didn't encounter any strong existences.
         A pirate attack ... Kong Jie wasn't that worried.
         With hou Xiaochen gone, Silver Moon had to have made some preparations. If the Pirates really did come to the South, they could actually hold out for a while, and reinforcements would soon arrive. It was not like Li Hao had imagined, where the city's defenses would be broken in an instant.
         Just as he was thinking, someone on the shore suddenly exclaimed.
         "What's that?"
         Kong Jie quickly looked into the distance. At this moment, in the sea, two large ships appeared. A flag was hanging in the air, fluttering in the wind. The flag was not big, but it seemed to be right in front of her. A fierce tiger seemed to be about to roar out, and a blood-red "li" character was written. The killing intent was awe-inspiring, as if it was about to break through the air and kill!
         Li Hao?
         Kong Jie was stunned. In the next moment, her pupils constricted. There were some things floating in the wind on the big ship. She had thought that they were pendants on the ship, but her eyes were very good. The next moment, her pupils constricted.
         Corpses!
          There were probably hundreds of corpses, all badly damaged, hanging around the ship!
         In the distance, Li Hao seemed to have come back to his senses. He suddenly said in a loud voice,""Demon hunt squad of the Silver Moon guards annihilated the first group of Pirates, the White shark Pirates, and killed hundreds of supers, hanging their corpses as a public warning, don't panic, residents of the South!"
         His voice was so loud that it spread in all directions!
         At this moment, there was a commotion in the city. Very quickly, a group of people ran over. Some of them looked at the two ships from afar and were shocked. They killed hundreds of supers?
         "The Wei Wu Army demon hunt squads?"
         "I've never heard of it ..."
         "I know a thing or two. I think it's the Wei Wu Army led by Li Hao. They're very small in number. Previously, at the transverse Canyon, they killed many people from the three major organizations ... I didn't expect him to go and kill Pirates."
         "The White shark Pirates, one of the eight great pirate crews ... This ... Is really bold! Killing so many of them won't lead to revenge, right?"
         “……”
         The crowd chimed in. The people who went south seemed to be quite knowledgeable. Some of the sea merchants who often went out to sea were actually very knowledgeable. They were far from what the people of the small city of silver North and the Silver City could compare to.
        
         They knew about the eight great pirate gangs, the three major organizations, and the existence of supers.
         As an open port, they had seen a lot. At this moment, they were also amazed. However, when the two big ships approached, some people were still terrified.
         "Everyone says that Li Hao is a demonic sword that kills without blinking ... I didn't expect him to be even more brutal than the legends say! Oh my God, how many people did he kill? This ..."
         "Tsk, you're only killing Pirates. Why don't you say that Pirates are crueler? But ... He was really bold. Wasn't he afraid that the White shark Pirates would take revenge on him? It's said that the White shark Pirates have an expert of the rising light. This Li Hao killed three suns before, but now he's met the rising light ..."
         "Idiot, with so many Pirates out there, perhaps only Xu Guang is leading the team. Li Hao can't possibly kill Xu Guang, can he?"
         “……”
         At this moment, many people were discussing.
         Some people's expressions even changed slightly.""That's ... The sea shark ship of the White shark Pirates 'third commander, hai Sha ... Hai Sha was a peak expert at the middle stage of the rising light realm. He ... He couldn't have died, right?"
         Some people's faces were pale.
         There were also some people who were more knowledgeable and said in shock,""The sea shark ship came here ... Could it be to attack the South? Otherwise, how could we have encountered the Wei Wu Army? Oh my God, could it be that the White shark Pirates were planning to ambush us last night?"
          "Your news is outdated. I received news this morning that coastal town, which is not far from us, has been attacked by the White shark Pirates. They massacred the town. I was thinking of bringing my men to evacuate this place this morning ... I didn't expect to see the sea shark ship here."
         “……”
         People were watching, discussing, and looking at the black-armored warriors on the ship.
         Demon hunt squads!
         More people were looking at Li Hao and the young man standing on the bow of the ship. Some were afraid, some were envious, and some were in admiration.
         At this moment, Kong Jie also looked at Li Hao and the two ships in disbelief.
         Hai Sha ... Is dead?
         Not only hai Sha, but he also seemed to have recognized the second ship. His eyes changed slightly, and he couldn't help but whisper,""The ship of the faceless shark?"
         "What?" Wang Ming was startled.
         "The second commander of the White shark Pirates has always been wearing a mask. Some people call him the faceless shark!"
         While Kong Jie recognized it, someone else also recognized it. In the city, a super looked into the distance and gasped,""That's ... That's the sea breaking ship of the faceless shark! Impossible ... The sea shark ship and the sea destroyer ship are both here ... The two great white shark Pirates "sunguang commanders ... How could they be?"
         He couldn't believe it!
         This was impossible!
         Those two were Overlord level experts in the sea. The White shark Pirates were able to become the fourth-ranked pirate group, and the contributions of these two commanders could not be ignored.
         But at this moment, he seemed to be ... Dead?
         If they didn't die, how could the warship be seized?
         At this moment, Li Hao stomped the ground and landed on the shore.
         On the other side, Kong Jie couldn't remain calm either. She looked at Li Hao."You killed the faceless shark and the sea shark?"
         Li Hao glanced at Kong Jie."The one with the mask?"
         "Yes,"
         "I don't know if it's true or not ... But he's dead."  Kong Jie took a deep breath and suddenly looked at Black Panther, as if she had thought of something. The next moment, she realized something. Could it be that this dog cooperated with Li Hao?
         This dog was not weak either.
         Last time, he had seen it as well. This guy had ambushed elder crimsonbright and killed him directly.
         After Kong Jie's shock, she regained her calm."You ... Why ... Did you just come back?"
         If he killed her, then so be it. If he just came back like that, wouldn't he ... Be bringing trouble to himself?
         Li Hao's tone was still calm."These people are extremely brutal. They even eat people. I'm going to hang their corpses as a warning to the others!" If the White shark Pirates dared to come, then the demon hunt squads would naturally go out to sea to meet them! If chief Kong is worried, Li Hao will be responsible for all the consequences!"
         Kong Jie was a little helpless."No... I'm saying, you ... You're doing this. You ... Forget it. You're already in big trouble anyway, so it doesn't matter. It's best if you don't go out to sea again and don't leave Silver Moon. Nandu was a port city, and there were actually many spies here. The news that you killed the faceless shark and hai Sha will soon spread. These two aren't ordinary people. They're both Xuguang. You have to be careful ..."
         Li Hao didn't care. He even shouted,""There must be spies of the Pirates here to tell white shark, sea shark, and faceless shark that they all died in my hands! Let him wash his neck and wait for me, Li Hao, to kill him! Moonsea is my territory, and it's not his place!"
         Kong Jie almost rolled her eyes. You really aren't afraid of trouble!
         Li Hao laughed.
         He suddenly thought it through.
         At this moment, he had really thought it through.
         Why should I be afraid of trouble?
         I'm not afraid!
         The more trouble there was, the better. At this moment, he thought of the records in the ancient books. When the ancient king was a rank-4, he was surrounded by rank-9S. He broke through countless cities and killed countless enemies. He had a narrow chance of survival and did not die in a hundred battles. The more he fought, the stronger he became ... In the end, he became an invincible expert.
         The difference between them was so great, yet they were not afraid of death.
         I'm now comparable to a mid-stage sunrise expert. The enemy is at most at the sunrise transformation stage and is still one stage higher than me. He's only two stages higher than me. Why should I be so afraid?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just let the storm come a little more violently!
         At that moment, gasps could be heard from all directions. The supers and ordinary people who were hiding in the city were all shocked.
         The two commanders of the White shark Pirates were killed by Li Hao?
          This demonic sword, wouldn't it ... Could it kill a late-stage Sunglow realm expert?
         This was impossible!
         This was too fast. A few days ago, the other party had killed six three suns, which was already shocking enough. How many days had it been?
         At that moment, Wang Ming was also overjoyed, but he quickly thought of something and hurriedly shouted,"Set up a banquet to celebrate! Let's celebrate the demon hunt squads "victory, let's celebrate General Li's victory!"
         This time, it was such a pity that he couldn't go. He had to make up for it and show his presence.
         Around him, the stalls that he had booked looked at each other in shock and fear, but they quickly began to prepare.
         Silvermoon's people were still quite valiant. Although they were a little scared when they saw the corpses in the distance, the Silvermoon military's style was still alright, and their reputation was not bad. In addition, there were people saying that if the Wei Wu Army had not exterminated the White shark Pirates, the White shark Pirates might have attacked the South last night. This made them feel a little more at ease.
         Soon, the fragrance spread.
         At the same time, the news began to spread rapidly in all directions.
         On this day, Li Hao, who was only a little famous, instantly became very famous. From the start of the journey south, the news spread that devil sword Li Hao, the captain of a demon hunt squad, had travelled a thousand li across the sea last night, killed two of the White shark Pirates "commanders, and killed several hundred supers ...
